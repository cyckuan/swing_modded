VICTIM IN A STABBING SAW ONLY THE BEST IN HER SCHIZOPHRENIC
FIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ On a summer night in 1995, there was a
lively backyard party in New Rochelle, with music and hanging
lanterns, and among the guests were Caroline Costello and Michael
Laudor, who whirled around the flagstone patio with the grace of
professional dancers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They looked up at each other and they were clearly, madly in
love with each other,'' recalled Leslie Mignault, the party's
hostess and a friend of the couple.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, two days after Ms. Costello was stabbed to death and one
day after Laudor, her mentally ill fiance, was charged with murder,
Ms. Mignault recalled that summer night to try to explain to a
reporter how Ms. Costello continued a relationship with Laudor,
despite the obstacles presented by his schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think she had a choice,'' said Ms. Mignault, with
simple understatement.
</P>
<P>
   That determination to listen to her own heart was consistent
with other shadings in the portrait Ms. Mignault and other grieving
friends drew of Ms. Costello Friday. They said she was an intensely
private and deeply principled person who resisted pressure from her
parents to break up with Laudor, a man whose schizophrenia was
almost outweighed by an even more fundamental shortcoming: He was
not from the Roman Catholic Church in which she had been raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know her family disapproved of her relationship to Michael
because she told me that, and I know that it saddened her,'' Ms.
Mignault said. ``She said she was confident of her relationship to
Michael and that her parents would come around.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Laudor, a tall, bearded man of 35, remained in the
Westchester County Jail awaiting psychiatric examinations and his
next court hearing on July 15. Ms. Costello's parents, who flew in
from Newton, Mass., were waiting for the completion of an autopsy
so they could begin making arrangements for a funeral. Meanwhile,
law-enforcement officials and friends confirmed that Laudor had
told his relatives that he had stopped taking his antipsychotic
medication because it was no longer working for him.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Costello, 37, was slightly built, with light brown hair and
a predilection for demure clothes. About the world, her friends and
Michael, she was upbeat, but about herself she had a tendency to be
deprecating.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had great intellectual abilities, and she was very modest
about them and somewhat insecure about them in the way that many
accomplished women are,'' said Randy Banner, a friend of the
couple.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while her fiance had some impressive achievements despite
his illness _ graduation from Yale Law School and more than $2
million in book and movie contracts _ Ms. Costello was no slacker.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Portsmouth, Va., outside Norfolk, the site of
the country's largest naval base. Friends say her father, William,
served on naval submarines before he began his current career as a
biostatistician. Her mother, Marilyn, is a registered nurse who was
close to Caroline and her two other daughters.
</P>
<P>
   The family eventually moved to the Boston suburb of Newton,
where Ms. Costello attended public schools, doing so well at Newton
North High School that she was accepted at Yale. She graduated as a
literature major in 1984. Some years afterward, she went to work
for IBM in New Haven, Conn., researching ways to apply computers in
schools. To enhance her specialization, she enrolled in a one-year
master's program at the Harvard School of Education.
</P>
<P>
   It was sometime in 1991, while she was working in New Haven,
that she met Laudor, who was studying law at Yale. He was a witty
and brilliant raconteur, yet deeply spiritual, with a strong
interest in Judaism. He was touched by her generosity and
tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought she was the sweetest person he had ever met and he
found her intensely attractive,'' Ms. Banner said.
</P>
<P>
   It soon became clear to Ms. Costello that Laudor spent a great
deal of energy just attending to daily fundamentals. Staying in a
conversation was sometimes wrenching, given his recurrent
hallucinations.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1994, Ms. Costello took a Manhattan job as associate
director of technology for the Edison Project, an upstart New York
firm trying to prove that it could run public schools better than
public servants could. She was managing the design of a new e-mail
system linking the project's 42 schools.
</P>
<P>
   She and Michael lived together for a time in the Riverdale
section of the Bronx. After Laudor received a $600,000 offer from
Scribner for his life story and a $1.5 million movie deal, they
moved into an apartment in Hastings-on-Hudson with sweeping views
of the Hudson River. Friends whom he had made over the years, like
Ms. Banner and Ms. Mignault, became her friends.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly six months ago, she told Ms. Mignault she wanted to have
a child with Michael, whose father, Charles, had a history of
mental illness as well.
</P>
<P>
   When her body was found on Wednesday in the kitchen of the
couple's apartment, law-enforcement authorities revealed something
only a small circle had known: Ms. Costello was pregnant. To her
friends, it was another indication of her steely commitment to
Michael.

Stewart slips at 18 
but holds Open lead
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JAYNE CUSTRED &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ Payne Stewart's temper started to rise as his ball
continued to roll back down the 18th green at the Olympic Club on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   What had started out as a 10-foot putt for birdie that would
have extended his two-stroke lead to three in the 1998 U.S. Open
quickly turned into a 25-footer to save par that would come up
short. The 18th had claimed another victim in the second round,
leaving Stewart clinging to a one-shot lead over The Woodlands'
Jeff Maggert and Bob Tway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually thought it would finish up three to four feet below
the hole, and suddenly it's 25,'' Stewart said. ``I commented to
the official walking with us that that pin was unfair. That green
is bordering on ridiculous where that pin is.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his troubles, Stewart's 71 put him at 3-under-par 137.
Maggert and Tway, who both managed to escape the carnage at No. 18,
had rounds of 69 and 70, respectively, to share second place at
138. The only other players under par after two rounds are Lee
Janzen, whose 66 was the best round of the day even with a double
bogey at No. 17; amateur sensation Matt Kuchar (69); and Lee Porter
(67), all at 139.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty players survived the 36-hole cut, which was set at
7-over-par 147.
</P>
<P>
   It was the field against the 18th green Friday. The pin was put
on the back left side of the green, just on the part of the slope
where it was nearly impossible to hold a ball. Anyone who tried to
land an approach shot near the hole got to watch his ball trickle
back down. Anyone who tried to putt close to the pin and missed
experienced the same outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lehman was just one who gave USGA officials ``both barrels''
after his trials at No. 18. Lehman was safely on in two shots,
approximately 35 feet below the hole. From there, he four-putted
for a double-bogey 6, stormed off the course into the scoring area
with his 75 and ripped into the first USGA official he saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who set this up are full of ,'' Lehman said. ``Tell
them that, OK? The 18th green is hard as a rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Triplett's' reaction was even more drastic. Already likely
to miss the cut, Triplett had no intention of watching while his
par putt slid below the hole and started back down the green.
Triplett simply put his putter head down on top of the ball,
stopping its progress, and then putted the ball into the cup for
bogey. Of course, he also was slapped with a two-stroke penalty for
interfering with the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just the last frustration of a frustrating day that
wasn't really golf out there,'' said Triplett, whose 79 sent him
packing for home.
</P>
<P>
   David Fay, executive director of the USGA, admitted the decision
to put the pin on the back left of the green might not have been a
good one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not what we hoped would happen,'' Fay said. ``We're not
happy with what happened. We had similar problems there in 1987,
just not as severe. But we didn't want to have the pin on the
bottom of the green for all four rounds. We thought if we put more
water on 18, it would be acceptable. As it turned out, if you were
above the hole or sideways, it was quite difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   While a majority of the second round was lost in the furor at
the 18th hole, there was solid golf played Friday at the Olympic
Club.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart appeared headed for the round of the day, opening with
three consecutive birdies and getting as low as 7-under. But he
lost steam down the stretch, spending too much time in the rough
and picking up bogeys on three of the last five holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the veterans, when they saw me at 6- or 7-under, knew that
it is going to come back,'' Stewart said. ``Everything comes back,
and for this championship, something right around par is going to
be a heck of a golf score.''
</P>
<P>
   Maggert certainly would agree. That's why he was extremely
pleased with his second consecutive 69. Maggert made several bogeys
during the round, which he knew he would, but he also picked up the
birdies when the opportunities were there.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my goals coming in for the week was to try to shoot
each round under par,'' said Maggert, who has finished in the top
four in two of the last three Opens. ``Obviously, that is a tough
goal. But for the first two days, I have managed to do that. So I
feel like I need to shoot under par on the weekend to have a chance
to win. I am certainly playing well enough to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   As is Janzen. He started the day at 3-over but went on a
back-nine run that included birdies on Nos. 11, 15 and 16, which
put him tied for the lead with Stewart at 3-under and headed for a
record round. But a double-bogey 6 on No. 17 after driving into the
deep rough dropped Janzen back to 1-under.
</P>
<P>
   With two rounds to go, almost anyone who survived the cut still
has a chance to win, and Maggert hopes to finally be the last man
standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't come out here to shoot a few good rounds and just
kind of wait to see what happens,'' Maggert said. ``I expect to
play well, and I expect to win. I expect to play well this weekend,
and if I don't, I'll be disappointed. But I like my chances. I feel
good about myself. I'm not here to finish second.''

CROSS-COUNTRY TREK USED TO URGE EARLY CANCER DETECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JUSTIN SCHMID  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, doctors told Jack Riley, 66, he had just six
months to live. No treatment would stop his prostate cancer from
spreading. But Riley's still riding on hope.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's 305 miles into his third Triathlon of Hope, which
started June 16 in San Diego. Riley is running, cycling and
swimming across the United States to raise money for cancer and
preach his early-detection message.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Fox, a Canadian cancer victim, inspired him to organize
the Triathlon of Hope.
</P>
<P>
   Riley's raised more than $200,000 for cancer research since his
first Triathlon of Hope in 1996. But he's not ready to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Though cancer ravages his body, Riley looks healthier than many
people half his age. He's at peace with his fate, but promises to
battle to the end.
</P>
<P>
   Riley, listed in the Guinness Book of World's Records, competed
in 52 triathlons in 52 weeks at age 52. The tenacious ex-fighter
pilot was also a top-10 finisher in Hawaii's grueling Iron Man
Triathlon.
</P>
<P>
   He says this cross-country journey will be the toughest.
</P>
<P>
   Riley, from Alamo, Calif., combats pain in his bones by taking
medication every five hours. He has only one-quarter of the energy
he had during his first Triathlon of Hope in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   His daily mileage has been cut nearly in half, from about 60
miles to 30 miles. He spends most of his time on a bike because
it's easiest on his body.
</P>
<P>
   He still runs into each town carrying his own version of the
Olympic Torch. But this trip isn't about athleticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been there already,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His real mission is helping wipe out cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors missed his tumor during a screening 10 years ago. When
they detected it five years later, it had spread too far.
</P>
<P>
   Riley says cancer doesn't scare him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to make cancer sorry it ever picked on me!'' he
pledges.
</P>
<P>
   He fights the disease with modern medicine, herbs, a healthy
lifestyle, self-healing and a strong spirit. Riley says the
spiritual element is most important, believing God is his best
defense.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to finish Sept. 16 in New York after swimming from New
Jersey to Ellis Island, where he'll proclaim liberty for all cancer
victims.
</P>

COUPLE INDICTED ON CHARGES OF DEFRAUDING LENDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   From all appearances, John Vergopia and his wife, Dixie Summers,
have been living the good life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the couple bought one of the largest homes in the gated
Scottsdale community of Montana Ranch. They formed several
marketing businesses and showed lenders income tax returns
reporting six-figure incomes. They now sell Arabian horses under
the name of En Vogue International Arabians.
</P>
<P>
   But according to a federal indictment returned against them last
week, the couple have been living a lie.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment claims Vergopia and Summers financed their
$357,000 home by defrauding lenders. It says they also swindled
hundreds of thousands of dollars from unsuspecting customers.
</P>
<P>
   Vergopia and Summers, who refused to comment about their case,
have pleaded innocent and face trial Aug. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale police Detective Paul Arnold said his department
occasionally confronts ``people coming in here from other states
and giving the appearance of being successful business people, when
in fact they're engaged in fraudulent activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold estimated he deals with such cases ``two or three times a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County court records and Scottsdale police records show
that the indictment is just the latest and most serious legal
problem for Vergopia and Summers, both of whom refused interview
requests this week.
</P>
<P>
   Summers has been sued for failure to pay monthly homeowners fees
at Montana Ranch and for failure to pay the lease on a $36,000
Lincoln Town Car. Scottsdale records show that since 1995, police
have been called to the couple's home at least seven times to quell
domestic-violence incidents in which Vergopia reportedly attacked
Summers.
</P>
<P>
   Summers has stalled foreclosure on the house by seeking the
protection of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Aspey said in a court hearing last
week that Vergopia has a string of convictions in New York, New
Jersey and Florida on offenses ranging from assault to disorderly
intoxication to criminal possession of a firearm.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's 12-count indictment charges that, to obtain home
loans, the couple submitted bogus federal tax returns that showed
Summers earned $969,000 from 1993 to 1996, while she reported
income of just $62,000 to the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges that Vergopia, claiming to be J. Cuttler,
president of Harvest Group International Ltd., wrote a letter to
lenders, confirming Summers' claims of employment and income.
</P>
<P>
   The case, presented by prosecutor Mark Aspey and FBI agent
Deanne Simpson, also alleges that Vergopia and Summers swindled
$410,000 from customers of their food brokerage businesses.
Vergopia and Summers would collect advance payments from their
customers and then simply pocket the money, according to the
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Although the indictment offers few details about the scheme, it
charges that the couple swindled a Florida business that won a
civil judgment against Vergopia last year in Maricopa County
Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the court ruled that Vergopia must pay $414,182 to
DJB Investments Inc. because he failed to deliver on a business
deal to supply Tylenol products at a inexpensive cost. Vergopia
took advance payment of $249,000 but never shipped the goods,
according to court documents. &QL;

COUNCIL POSTPONES PLAN TO ADD GOLDWATER NAME TO SKY HARBOR
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The name Sky Harbor International Airport lives, at least for
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   After days of receiving angry phone calls from the public _ and
losing support from some council members _ Phoenix Mayor Skip
Rimsza on Friday asked to postpone a final decision on renaming the
airport until Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo to the council, he instructed City Manager Frank
Fairbanks to set up public hearings during the summer for input on
plans to name the airport after Barry Goldwater.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Rimsza, the Phoenix City Council voted 6-3 this week to
rename the airport to honor Goldwater, the U.S. senator and
presidential nominee who died May 29 at age 89.
</P>
<P>
   But to become final, Tuesday's vote would have to be formally
adopted at the council's July 1 meeting. Some council members _
struck by the intense public outcry against the name change _ said
they talked with the mayor in recent days and asked him to delay
the July 1 vote. Rimsza relented Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the memo, Rimsza wrote that he felt the council ``did exactly
what we're elected to do. Still we have heard the pleas from
people. People who love Barry Goldwater. But people who want us to
hear their ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the public hearings won't necessarily be limited to the
name of the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have a lot of ideas,'' Rimsza said. ``In the
end, people were complaining about process, so I want to clear that
up and let them have an opportunity to vent their ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Many who called City Hall this week asked that the airport name
be left alone, but that other spots in the city _ such as Squaw
Peak or a proposed north Phoenix desert pre serve _ be named for
Goldwater.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the public hearings are still being worked out, but
the sessions could be scheduled for late July and early August.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix Councilman Cody Wil liams voted against renaming the
airport Tuesday because of his concern that people didn't have a
voice in the decision. He said Friday that he approves of the
postpone ment _ if people's concerns will actually be heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is just a facade to create the allusion that the
public has had a chance to address the issue, then we're adding
insult to injury,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His concern is to have all the information available, including
the cost of a name change and how it could affect marketing efforts
to increase the awareness of ``Sky Harbor'' in foreign nations.
</P>
<P>
   News of the delay also was a relief to such residents as Judy
Clarke of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fit to be tied when I heard they were going to change
the name `Sky Harbor,' '' she said. But she said Friday that she
was ``thrilled at the idea of the public input.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke said she is not anti-Gold water. She appreciates his work
as a statesman. Her father worked with Goldwater and her parents
voted for him when he ran for president. It's just that ``Sky
Harbor is just too beautiful a name. It's unique in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Doug Lingner made the motion Tuesday to rename the
airport ``Goldwater Sky Harbor International.'' By Friday, he said
he had a change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since then we've heard from a lot of other people and it's
apparent to me . . . some sort of community input _ aside from
telephone calls _ is necessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a feel-good ges ture,'' he said. ``I want them to
have the opportunity to share with us their concerns and wishes . .
. my decision will be based on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rimsza, though, is standing firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I know and feel tells me this is the right thing to
do,'' the mayor wrote to the council. ``I'll never do anything less
than that. That's why I will be voting to name the airport after
Barry Gold water. He deserves the Grand Can yon _ but this will do
just fine.'' &QL;

COMMENTARY: BOTH SIDES NOW

 (EDS: Corrects name of country in first sentence of graf 10) (lb) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ I came here expecting to hear all about how
the Indian nuclear test was meant to cope with the Pakistani
threat. What I heard instead was Indians from across the political
spectrum insisting that their nuclear sound and light show on May
11 was actually meant to signal America and China that India views
their emerging ``alliance'' with great concern and will not let
these two powers carve up Asia without regard to India.
</P>
<P>
   Even those Indian politicians who denounce their nuclear tests
as a cheap, jingoistic maneuver by India's new Hindu nationalist
government, when you scratch them, will tell you these tests were
the only way for India to get what it wants most from the United
States and China: R-E-S-P-E-C-T.
</P>
<P>
   I finally realized the depth of this sentiment when I went to
see a saffron-robed Indian human-rights campaigner, Swami Agnivesh.
Surely, I thought, he will disavow this test. But no sooner did we
sit down on the floor of his simple Delhi house than he declared:
``We are India, the second-largest country in the world. You can't
just take us for granted. India doesn't feel threatened by
Pakistan, but in the whole international game India is being
marginalized by the China-U.S. axis.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as the Cold War was on, and the Soviets were in effect
protecting India against China, India did not feel an urgency to
develop its own nuclear weapon, notes Raja Mohan, strategic editor
of The Hindu newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   But the Soviet collapse, coupled with U.S. pressure on India to
sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and not go nuclear, coupled
with the rise of China as an economic and military powerhouse, left
the Indians feeling they were on their own. Said Mohan: ``It was
clear that China had run ahead of us and they were being
incorporated as the world's No. 2 power and that we were being told
to stay in a small box, while the U.S. gave South Asia to China.''
</P>
<P>
   When I asked India's defense minister, George Fernandes, what he
would say to President Clinton about the Indian tests, he answered:
``I would ask Bill Clinton why is it that you feel yourself so
close to China and you can trust China with nuclear weapons and you
can trust yourself with nuclear weapons and you can trust Russia,
France and Britain with nuclear weapons, but you cannot trust
India?''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandes added: ``And now we have news that the U.S. and China,
during President Clinton's visit, will work out arrangements so
that their respective nuclear weapons will not be targeted on each
other. So the U.S. and China are settling their nuclear problems,
while we are obviously a nation that must not care for our own
security concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   India's former Foreign Secretary J.N. Dixit said to me: ``Your
government tolerates China no matter what it does. Whether it is
nuclear weapons tests or abuse of human rights, your government
says, `No, we cannot spoil relations with China.'''
</P>
<P>
   India's former Prime Minister I.K. Gujral _ a critic of India's
nuclear test _ elaborated: ``(Former U.S. Defense Secretary
William) Perry went to Beijing and said China should take more
interest in South Asia. I asked myself: What is the purpose of
making this statement? Is it a division of areas of influence? If
you have decided that this side of Suez is an area of influence of
China, what should an Indian policy-maker do?''
</P>
<P>
   No American president has visited India in 20 years, added
Gujral, ``but Clinton doesn't mind going to China. (What China does
in) Tiananmen is all right, in Tibet is all right, in Taiwan is all
right. Everything (China does) is all right, but you ignore our
security concerns because we are poor and a non-nuclear power. In
your eyes either having a bomb or making money is what matters.
Well, money is very difficult to make. A bomb is not.''
</P>
<P>
   China, explained an Indian defense analyst, K. Subrahmanyam, is
the major rising power in the world, and when a major power like
China emerges, it needs to be counterbalanced. Russia balances
China from the north, Japan and Korea from the east, and now India
is doing it from the west and south. ``It is like embedding Germany
in NATO,'' he concluded. ``One day you will give us thanks for our
nuclear test.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether any of this makes sense, frankly, I don't know. But I do
know this: These views are widely shared here. And any U.S. policy
that ignores them, and just orders India to turn the clock back and
put its nuclear genie back in the bottle, is not going to work.

MARTIN MAKES THE CUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The worst of Casey Martin's problems Friday was
that he tripped over a few of his newfound fans, which gives you a
pretty good gauge of how grand a day it was for the disabled
golfer.
</P>
<P>
   While continuing to win friends and influence people, Martin
also managed to make the cut at the U.S. Open on his very first
try. By chasing his opening-round 74 with a 1-over-par 71, the
golfer who has created headlines all week for becoming the first
player in U.S. Open history to use a cart moved one giant step
closer to his ultimate goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to be known more as a golfer than a person with a
disability,'' said Martin, who was born with a rare circulatory
disease in his right leg that makes walking painful. ``Making the
cut in the U.S. Open gives me confidence. I think if I just keep
improving I can be out here and really be a steady fixture.''
</P>
<P>
   His cart ran fine Friday, but it's a wonder Martin didn't run
out of gas emotionally. He continues to be overwhelmed by the
outpouring of support he is receiving from his galleries. Call them
Casey's Crusaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been just a great experience,'' Martin, 26, said.
``The crowd support and just playing in the U.S. Open, period, is a
blast. I am having a great time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bitten by No. 18: Before the 18th green went one-on-one with
Payne Stewart and won, it practiced on former Pepperdine standout
Brent Geiberger.
</P>
<P>
   Some two hours before Stewart stroked an 8-foot birdie putt that
missed the hole by inches and trickled 25 feet down the glassy
slope, Geiberger had stood over virtually the same putt, with the
exact same results.
</P>
<P>
   The difference was, Stewart's 3-putt finish merely trimmed his
lead to one stroke while Geiberger's 3-putt put him on the wrong
side of the cut by one stroke, at plus-8.
</P>
<P>
   Geiberger, who tacked on a 77 to his opening-round 71, had no
way of knowing it at the time, but he would miss the cut by a
matter of inches, which is how close his comeback putt came to
falling.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old called the pin placement ``illegal'' _ an
opinion echoed by Stewart who called it ``bordering on the
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore fades: Jason Gore, another former Pepperdine standout, got
off to a sizzling start. He birdied the par-5 first hole and the
par-4 fourth to get to 5-over-par with a bullet. In his own mind,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I was thinking I could get myself into contention,''
said Gore, who had opened with a 77. ``I was thinking of (shooting)
a 65.''
</P>
<P>
   Bogeys on three of the next five holes served as a rather harsh
reality check on the way to a second-round 76. The good news is the
course in Greensboro, N.C., where the Hart High graduate is headed
for next week's Nike Tour event, is going to seem like a
pitch-and-putt layout next to the Olympic Club's Lake Course.
</P>
<P>
   ``This course just wears on you,'' Gore said. ``It's going to
make every golf course I play from now on seem really easy.''

EARLY ALARMS WERE SOUNDED OVER CHUNG DONATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: This is a late add to page 1 of the New York Times.)  
(lh) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Not long after Johnny Chung and his checkbook were
welcomed into Democratic fund-raising circles, some senior party
officials worried that he posed a potential problem.
</P>
<P>
   There were suspicions that the struggling California businessman
was using the White House to raise consulting fees from the Chinese
businessmen that he escorted to fund-raising events in Los Angeles
and Washington. As early as March 1995, the Democratic National
Committee's finance director, Richard Sullivan, said, he raised the
possibility that Chung was a conduit for illegal foreign money from
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a sense that he might be taking money from them and then
giving it to us, you know,'' Sullivan said in his deposition with
Senate investigators last year. But those concerns apparently did
not prevent the Democrats from accepting a $125,000 check from
Chung, which led to access for him and several Chinese businessmen
to a dinner at the home of the filmmaker Steven Spielberg. Not long
after that check cleared, the Democratic National Committee
chairman, Donald Fowler, said the ``Democratic Party is lucky to
have'' Chung.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Fowler and other leading Democrats say they feel
betrayed by Chung, who embarrassed them again last month when it
was revealed that he told federal investigators that he had
funneled nearly $100,000 from a Chinese military officer to the
Democrats in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Chung's account represents the first hard evidence of the
``China Plan'' to influence the U.S. presidential election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats and White House officials repeatedly asked Chung
for money and never said no to any of Chung's contributions leading
up to the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Chung, a southern California businessman, pleaded
guilty to campaign-related bank and tax fraud charges, and he is to
be sentenced July 20. While cooperating with the Justice
Department's campaign finance inquiry, Chung has described for
federal investigators his view of what Democratic fund-raisers knew
_ and should have known _ about his contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Brian A. Sun, Chung's lawyer, confirmed that Chung had given
detailed briefings about his conversations with Democratic party
officials to investigators, but he refused to divulge any details.
</P>
<P>
   There was no secret among Democratic officials that Chung was
aggressively promoting his fax business. He asked both the party
and the White House to hire his company (both declined). And at
nearly every fund-raising event he attended, Chung had escorted
Chinese businessmen who were anxious to meet the president.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Chung feels stung that the Democrats have blamed him for
the troubles that he brought to the party, Sun said. ``What is
troubling to Mr. Chung is the suggestion that the DNC was a victim
in this,'' he said. ``The DNC's fund-raisers were willing
participants.''
</P>
<P>
   But Peter J. Kadzik, a lawyer for the Democratic committee, said
that any accusations by Chung against party fund-raisers are
``baseless.'' He said there was no reason for party leaders to ever
suspect that Chung's donations came from anyone other than him. He
said Chung, as he awaits sentencing, ``has every reason to point
his finger at others.''

 WASHINGTON: at others.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chung and his company, Automated Intelligent Systems Inc., gave
the Democrats a total of $366,000, all of which has since been
returned because of questions about its origins. And nearly
$100,000 of those contributions, he recently told federal
investigators, originated with Liu Chao Ying, the Chinese military
officer whom he escorted to meet President Clinton at a Brentwood,
Calif., fund-raising dinner in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Chung got his first taste of political gift-giving in the summer
of 1994 when he attended a governor's association convention in
Washington and the president's 48th birthday party, a fund-raising
event. He donated $10,000 and brought several associates to the
party, and was given status as a ``DNC trustee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when Johnny realized that if you make a donation, you
get something in return,'' Sun said.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 19, Chung's fax company gave $40,000 to the Democrats.
The following day, Chung and Shi-Zeng Chen, a Haomen beer magnate,
attended a White House Christmas party, and had their pictures
taken with the president and Mrs. Clinton. The photo with Clinton
would be used to sell beer in Beijing in a billboard display.
</P>
<P>
   Just two months later, Chung planned on bringing five Chinese
business executives to Washington. He asked for a meeting with
President Clinton, a meeting with Vice President Gore, lunch at the
White House mess, permission to attend the President's weekly radio
address, and other perks.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the White House tour, the request was rejected by
Sullivan, whom Chung described as his ``primary contact'' at the
Democratic National Convention in his proffer given last summer to
the Senate committee investigating campaign finance abuses. Indeed,
Sullivan referred the matter to Fowler, who helped make
arrangements for Chung and the Chinese delegation to attend the
radio address.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, then the finance director, has said he felt
``uncomfortable'' about Chung because he kept bringing Chinese
businessmen to fund-raising events.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan declined to comment for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Stymied by the Democratic committee, Chung took his request to
the first lady's office, and asked for help in arranging a White
House tour and lunch at the White House mess. He handed over a
check for $50,000 to Mrs. Williams inside the White House, which
the Senate committee said, ``apparently made it possible for Chung
to achieve what had hitherto been denied him: his clients'
attendance at President Clinton's weekly radio address on March 11,
1995.''
</P>
<P>
   The president told aides that he regretted the fact that Chung
was able to get several Chinese businessmen into his radio address.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1995, Scott Pastrick, the party treasurer, traveled to
California to ask Chung for more money. Chung agreed to write the
party a $125,000 check, which bought him and several Chinese
businessmen seats at a fund-raising dinner at Spielberg's home.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, Chung again attended a Democratic
fund-raiser, this one for the Clinton-Gore campaign in California.
Chung, who took 19 guests to the $1,000-a-plate dinner, gave a
check for at least $20,000, but he was later told he needed 20
separate $1,000 checks.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, Chung rounded up checks from his employees and
friends of friends, but he reimbursed them for their contributions.
Although a campaign worker had warned Chung not to do that, Sun
argued that the fund-raisers had to know that Chung had no choice.
``At that time, Johnny doesn't understand the vagaries of campaign
finance law,'' Sun said.
</P>
<P>
   In the next year, Chung would give another $100,000, and be
asked to give much more, Sun said. Speaking of Democratic
fund-raisers, the lawyers said, ``These guys would have been a lot
smarter if they just fessed up and said they just wanted Johnny's
money and got carried away.''

RIO SALADO FOOTBALL STADIUM COMPLEX PLAN UNVEILED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LISA GONDERINGER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Backers of a new stadium for the Arizona Cardinals unveiled the
largest project in state history Friday, a $2.3 billion mega sports
and convention complex on the Tempe-Mesa line surrounded by hotels,
housing, shops, restaurants, office buildings and parks.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed 900-acre project, called Rio Salado Crossing, could
one day be home to 15,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Private investors would foot about four-fifths of the bill for
the mini-city, including $200 million from the Cardinals. The team
claims that figure, greeted with thunderous applause, is one of the
largest contributions a National Football League team has made to a
new stadium project. The team would contribute $75 million
immediately, and the rest later on.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; An additional $1.694 billion is expected to be ponied up by
private developers involved in the retail, hotel and residential
parts of the project over the next 10 years. Backers say some of
those developers already have signed onto the project, but would
not identify them. In other cases, deals are still being worked
out.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hefty private investment, the project still will
have to land as much as $489 million in public funds.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that, $320 million, would come from a 20-year
quarter-cent sales tax that must be approved by voters in Mesa and
Tempe. It would go toward public parks and recreation, the
convention center and mass transit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been very careful to make sure public funds would be
used for the public parts of the project,'' said Julie Pace,
chairwoman of the Rio Salado Crossing Association, which has been
working furiously since September to retool the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``People told us loud and clear that they did not want to fund a
football stadium. They wanted something that would give back to the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   An additional $169 million will be collected from sales taxes
generated from businesses within the project, including hotels,
restaurants, shops and concessions inside the stadium. The majority
of those dollars would join the Cardinals' contribution to the $299
million stadium, which is to have a retractable roof.
</P>
<P>
   The Mesa and Tempe city councils must now decide if they want to
form a convention-facilities voting district that would complete
negotiations with developers and put the tax on the November
ballot. Only Tempe and Mesa residents would be subject to the tax.
</P>
<P>
   The plan will die if either city decides not to join the
district, or if either city's voters reject the tax.
</P>
<P>
   Several council members at the unveiling, including Hugh Hallman
and Joe Spracale of Tempe and Bill Jaffa of Mesa, said they were
ready to get the issue on the ballot. But they were quick to say
that doesn't mean they are in favor of the tax.
</P>
<P>
   Others, such as Mesa Councilman John Giles and Tempe Mayor Neil
Giuliano, say they want more concrete financial details before they
will support forming a stadium district.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got pretty pictures, but not a lot of substance,'' Giles
said. Dennis Kavanaugh, also on the Mesa council, said he saw huge
potential in the project, but worried that too many complex
questions would have to be answered too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a world-class facility, so why rush it?'' said Dave
Spaur, Mesa's economic development director. ``Its not like anyone
is going to take away that land.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pace said it is crucial to get the tax on the November
ballot while the economy is still good, bond rates are favorable
and investors are willing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may not be the case six months from now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The project would stretch for three miles along the south bank
of the dry Salt River bed and include land in Mesa, Tempe, and
unincorporated county islands.
</P>
<P>
   Its centerpiece is a futuristic-looking Arizona Exposition and
Convention Center, which, its advocates say, would catapult the
state into the top tier in competing for large conventions. It
would be the 16th largest center in the country, with 1 million
square feet of space, and would be attached to the state's largest
hotel, with 1,250 rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Valley is really losing out when it comes to landing the
most significant conventions,'' Pace said. ``In the last five
years, Phoenix has only hosted one of the top 200 conventions in
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The 67,000-seat football stadium is part of the same building.
When not in use, the field can be rolled away from the building and
the floor can be turned into extra convention space.
</P>
<P>
   Pace said other cities, such as Indianapolis and St. Louis, have
been successful in similar projects that combine stadiums and
convention centers.
</P>
<P>
   The state-of-the-art stadium would have one end &UR; zone in Tempe
and the other in Mesa, as well as two huge glass doors _ 150 feet
high and 240 feet wide _ on the northern end that would give fans a
panoramic view of Squaw Peak, Camelback Mountain and Mummy
Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Just south of the stadium would be a sizable retail and
entertainment district, that could include big-name tenants such as
the All-Star Cafe and the PGA Tour Shop. It would include the NFL
Experience, an interactive football theme park.
</P>
<P>
   There are also plans, later in the development, to add almost
3,000 more hotel rooms in resort and smaller suite hotels. A
whopping 2 million square feet of office space and more than 6,000
condominiums, apartments and single-family homes are also in the
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Backers envision 15,000 people living within Rio Salado Crossing
and 8,000 to 10,000 working there.
</P>
<P>
   Pace said she thinks one of the biggest selling points is that
two-thirds of the project is devoted to open space, including four
new parks linked by 10 miles of trails, 12 acres of lakes and
waterways and three 18-hole public golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   The park system, which will link Scottsdale's Indian Bend Wash
and Tempe's Rio Salado greenbelts, will include a rock climbing
wall, urban fishing, paddle boats, water taxis, a skateboard park
and a 1,500-seat amphitheater.
</P>
<P>
   If the tax passes, ground could be broken on the first phase as
early as November 1999. That construction would include the
convention center, stadium and hotel complex; 2,000 condo and
apartment units; 350,000 square feet of retail space; and the first
park and golf course, to be located on the western end. It would be
ready to go by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Other phases, including single-family homes and other hotels,
could take as long as 10 years to come online.
</P>
<P>
   The project has changed drastically since the East Valley
Partnership started looking at whether a new Cardinals stadium was
feasible two years ago. The team has long contended that Sun Devil
Stadium is inadequate, too hot for fans and puts them at a
competitive disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership quickly learned they would have to add other
elements, such as a convention center, to the mix to make it
profitable and to sell it to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Pace said the size of the Cardinals' contribution and the fact
they only want to be a tenant rather than a major owner, should
help ease public bitterness about funding sports projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so much more,'' she said. ``It will leave an economic
development mark on the Valley for decades.'' &QL;

COURSE BITES STEWART LATE, HOLDS LEAD TO 1 SHOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Payne Stewart's pleasure cruise at the U.S. Open
officially came to a screeching halt yesterday in the same place it
began _ on the closing holes of the Olympic Club.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who took control of the leader board with birdies on
the final three holes in Thursday's opening round, frittered away
three strokes to the field over the final five holes yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a lead that once stood at five strokes dwindled to
one heading into the weekend rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who fashioned a second-round 71 to remain 3 under par
for the tournament, stands a stroke ahead of Bob Tway and Texas A&AMP;M
graduate Jeff Maggert (2 under). Three others are at 1 under: Lee
Janzen, Lee Porter and U.S. Amateur champ Matt Kuchar.
</P>
<P>
   None of the other 156 starters managed to crack even-par through
two rounds at the 6,797-yard, par-70 layout, where the average
score for yesterday's second round was 74.4. The cut fell at 7
over, allowing 60 players _ the Open minimum _ to play this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart had things going early. He took birdies on the first
three holes, reaching 7 under. But he backslid with bogeys at Nos.
14, 17 and 18, opening the door to a variety of pursuers heading
into the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 25 pursuers remain within seven strokes, including
past major-championship winners Nick Price (1 over), Scott Simpson
(3 over), Tom Lehman (3 over) and John Daly (4 over). The group
also includes David Duval (3 over), Colin Montgomerie (4 over) and
Phil Mickelson (4 over).
</P>
<P>
   Among the notables to survive the cut were disabled golfer Casey
Martin (5 over), Fort Worth resident Mark Brooks (6 over), Tiger
Woods (6 over) and Jack Nicklaus (7 over).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a nip-and-tuck finish,'' Stewart said. ``It
looked like I was going to run away for a while, but that just
doesn't happen in a U.S. Open. I knew I was going to give some
back. You just hope you don't give back too many.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, a former SMU standout who won the 1991 Open, gave back
one he was not counting on at No. 18. After knocking his approach
shot to eight feet, Stewart watched in amazement as his birdie putt
made a hard left turn just before the cup and rolled 20 feet
downhill.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he joined several players in criticizing the U.S.
Golf Association's pin placement at No. 18, where Daly had a
40-foot birdie putt die an inch from the cup but roll backward four
feet before stopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that pin was unfair. When you have balls roll up, then
roll back away without stopping, that's bordering on ridiculous,''
Stewart said. ``I don't know if you would call it an illegal pin,
but I know I wasn't the only player who spoke to the USGA's walking
marshal about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he was not. The pin placement drew enough complaints
that USGA executive director David Fay all but issued a post-round
apology, saying that officials ``miscalculated'' the severity of
the slope at the 347-yard par-4 that elicited an average score of
4.22 in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, we expected it to be the most difficult spot on the
green,'' Fay said. ``But it didn't turn out the way we'd hoped.
We're not happy with what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Janzen, the 1993 Open champ, shrugged off the challenging pin at
No. 18 more easily than he shrugged off the double bogey at No. 17
that dropped him out of a tie with Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come to the U.S. Open expecting nothing to be fair,'' said
Janzen, whose 66 marked the lowest score of the second round. ``If
you hit it in the rough, you can't get it to the green. If you hit
the green, it's hard to two-putt. ... It's a test of wills. You
find out who overcomes adversity the best and who has the most
patience.''
</P>
<P>
   After dropping his seventh birdie putt of the round at No. 16 to
grab a share of the lead, that appeared to be Janzen. But he gave
back two strokes with a double bogey at No. 17 after a drive into
the rough.
</P>
<P>
   Among the front-runners, Maggert and Kuchar were the only
players who did not lose ground at No. 17, a par-4 that played to a
scoring average of 4.68 strokes per player and is rapidly emerging
as the probable pivotal hole of the weekend rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Maggert, at this juncture, remains the only player in the field
to break par in both rounds at Olympic.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal coming in was to shoot each round under par,'' said
Maggert, who slept on the lead heading into the final round of the
1997 Open but finished fourth. ``Obviously, that is a tough goal.
But if I can do that, I am going to be right there.''

Astros keep 
Reds reeling
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Despite allowing five hits in the first inning Friday night, Sean
Bergman knew he was making good pitches.
</P>
<P>
   He just needed to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty sure they were good pitches, but when you hear it
from your catcher, it makes a difference,'' said Bergman, who
pitched eight strong innings in the Astros' 4-2 victory over the
Cincinnati Reds at the Astrodome. ``I came in after the first
inning, and Brad (Ausmus) told me to keep making good pitches, that
they had been hitting good pitches, and not get discouraged, and
try to stay aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The pep talk worked.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman settled down after the Reds' two-run first inning,
limiting Cincinnati to four hits and no runs over the next seven
innings en route to his sixth victory of the season. Carl Everett
went 2-for-3 with two runs batted in, and Ricky Gutierrez added
three hits as the Astros extended their lead in the National League
Central to three games over the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got five hits off Bergman, and only one of them was hit
hard,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``That's tough to deal
with. In the first inning, it might be a little easier because you
know your team has a long way to come back, but still he survived
that. That's something a lot of pitchers have trouble with when
they face first-inning difficulty. Once he got rolling, he was
hitting his spots and changing speeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati, which has been held to two or fewer runs in 11 of
its last 14 games, received consecutive one-out singles from Mike
Frank, Barry Larkin, Willie Greene and Dmitri Young in the first
inning. Bret Boone added an RBI single in the inning as Bergman dug
himself into an early hole. From that point, with the exception of
a threat in the fifth, the Reds didn't come close to scoring again
as they suffered their sixth straight loss and 14th in their last
17 games.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman (6-3) allowed two runs and nine hits in eight innings.
Billy Wagner pitched a 1-2-3 ninth for his 17th save.
</P>
<P>
   Everett ignited the Astros' comeback with his seventh home run
of the season, a solo shot to right field in the second inning that
sliced the Reds' lead to 2-1. He added an RBI double during the
Astros' three-run fourth inning and has driven in 15 runs in his
last 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so timely, because if you play Carl all year, he's going
to have times when he struggles, just like Jeff Bagwell has, like
Derek Bell has, and everybody has and will,'' Dierker said. ``For
him to have his hottest streak of the year when (center fielder)
Richard Hidalgo is out of action is a blessing for us. I hope he
can continue, because Richard is not that close to coming back. He
has really filled that void and then some.''
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo suffered a separated shoulder on May 30 at Colorado, and
Everett has started the last 19 games in his place.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first year I've ever started this early, and I'm
getting those consistent at-bats. That will help anyone,'' said
Everett, who is batting .615 (8-for-13) during the Astros' current
homestand. ``Everybody on this team wants to do well and help the
team. This is not a team of egos. This is a team that chips in and
tries to do the best it can.''
</P>
<P>
   Reds starter Scott Winchester, who pitched six shutout innings
against the Astros five days earlier, had no such luck as the
Astros took command of the game in the fourth inning. Jeff Bagwell
led off the inning with a double and advanced to third on a
groundout by Moises Alou. Everett then doubled to pick up his 36th
RBI of the season and knot the score at 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros tagged Winchester for two more runs in the inning.
Ricky Gutierrez lined a 2-2 pitch into the left-center-field gap to
score Everett with the go-ahead run, and Ausmus followed with an
infield hit down the third-base line. Craig Biggio provided the
final blow with a two-out chopper over third base, his second hit
of the game, scoring Gutierrez for a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Winchester (3-4) allowed four runs and nine hits in five
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds' only other significant scoring threat came in the
fifth, when they put runners at second and third with two outs
before Bergman coaxed Eddie Taubensee into an inning-ending flyout
to center field.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman retired the final nine batters he faced, making him a
popular man with the Astros' bullpen. His eight-inning effort
enabled Dierker to give his beleaguered relief corps a rest, not a
small thing with three of the Astros' next four games scheduled for
afternoon starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was pretty significant in terms of what has happened in
the last three or four games with the way the guys in the bullpen
have been used,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by some early encouragement, it was the least Bergman
could do.

SELLERS CLAIMS THREE OF FOUR ALL-STAR RACES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ Before fans even had a chance to get
comfortable in their seats, the suspense was gone. Shane Sellers
saw to it right away that last night's NTRA All-Star Jockey
Championships had all the drama of a Tiger Woods tap-in, or a
September pennant race with the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers won the first two races of the four-race event at Lone
Star Park at Grand Prairie to open a commanding lead, and then for
good measure added another victory in the final race.
</P>
<P>
   That meant the 32-year-old Louisiana native _ practically a
young whippersnapper amid the Hall of Famers _ finished the
competition with an unbeatable 36-point total and took bragging
rights back to Kentucky along with the $25,000 first prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those situations where the horses ran for me,''
Sellers said. ``I've always been a firm believer that when you get
to be a certain caliber of rider, the only thing that separates you
is (the horse) between your legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Krone won the other race and finished second with 18
points. Jerry Bailey recorded two seconds and wound up third with
12 points.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's winner, Gary Stevens, was hampered by a weak draw
and scored only three points.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers won aboard Shareef Dancer (2nd), Miami Flyer (4th) and
Mocha Express (7th). Krone took the 6th race with Illusive Ghost.
</P>
<P>
   But for this night, at least, the horses were secondary,
especially once the astounding payoffs were posted for Lone Star's
new All-Star wager, where fans could wager on the jockeys over the
four-race series rather than the horses. Given the mounts they
received, the Sellers-Krone-Bailey trifecta was entirely
predictable, and yet it paid a whopping $670.60 for a $2 wager. The
exacta paid $150.80.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers, one of the leading riders in Kentucky, hadn't had much
luck at Lone Star before last night.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he rode Skip Away to a disappointing third-place
finish in the inaugural Texas Mile. He returned to Lone Star two
months later for the first All-Star jockey competition, and
finished 10th among the dozen riders.
</P>
<P>
   But Sellers has won more than 3,000 races in his career,
including some big ones. He is best-known for riding Skip Away to
an upset victory over Cigar in the 1996 Jockey Club Gold Cup, and
for winning last fall's Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies on Countess
Diana.
</P>
<P>
   And he has an All-Star championship to put on his resume.
Sellers dedicated the victory to fallen friend Robby Albarado, who
went down in a spill three days ago at Churchill Downs in
Louisville, Ky., and sustained a fractured skull. Albarado
underwent surgery to have a titanium plate placed over the
fracture, but is expected to miss only a few weeks of riding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat Day is my idol,'' said Sellers, who wore Albarado's
monogrammed undershirt beneath his riding silks, ``but Robby is one
of my best friends. I didn't tell anybody, but I dedicated this
championship for him.''

WILL CARDINALS LEAVE WITHOUT NEW STADIUM? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cardinals say they are committed to Arizona, but it's
unclear whether that commitment extends beyond this fall, when the
fate of a proposed stadium is determined.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are an integral part of the proposed Rio Salado
Crossing, a $1.5 billion development project that includes a $299
million, retractable-roof stadium that is in turn part of a
convention center. The stadium would seat 67,000 for most games but
could be expanded to 78,400 with the addition of bleachers in its
north end.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has assured project backers that a new facility would
earn the Valley at least one Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bidwill, Cardinals vice president and general counsel,
said the Cardinals aren't thinking about plans beyond this
November. That's when voters in Mesa and Tempe could be asked to
consider a quarter-cent sales tax that would help fund portions of
the project other than the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've put an attractive plan together, and that plan should
run its course,'' said Bidwill, a son of Cardinals owner Bill
Bidwill. ``We've said all along we're committed to the Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   But for how long? And if the proposal is defeated, will the
Cardinals look to move to another city? Bidwill declined to answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to focus on November,'' he said. ``That's what we're
interested in doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The stadium portion of the project will be funded in part by the
Cardinals, who will contribute $75 million toward construction,
provided the team's lease agreement is comparable to those of other
NFL teams.
</P>
<P>
   The team also has agreed to pay $50 million over 25 years to
cover game-day operating costs. In addition, the team will invest
$75 mil lion in other parts of the development, including retail
shops and hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bidwill has been the Cardinals' point person on the
stadium issue, while his father has stepped into the background.
Bill Bidwill did not attend Friday's meeting of the East Valley
Partnership, where the plans were announced.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bidwill pointed out that in the past three years 13 of
15 referendums on sports facilities throughout the country have
been approved by voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``And many of them had far less contributions than the team has
committed to today,'' Bidwill said. ``We're excited about that
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals believe Sun Devil Stadium is antiquated by NFL
standards. Among the complaints are that the heat makes it
uncomfortable for fans early in the season, and restroom and
concession facilities are inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   A new stadium also will mean more money to the Cardinals through
various sources, including additional ticket revenue, luxury-box
sales, advertising and sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   Naming rights alone could be sold for $40 million to $50 million
over a 20- to 25-year period, and most teams receive a hefty chunk
of that money.
</P>
<P>
   A new stadium and a favorable lease also dramatically increase
the value of a team. The Cardinals, valued at $187 million last
year, would be worth well over $200 million with a new stadium,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Bidwill said the Cardinals need a new facility ``to remain
competitive, to have the ability to keep our premier players and
attract new marquee, premier players.'' &QL;

FROM A PROMISING PATH TO A CHARGE OF MURDER

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As he left his Queens home on Tuesday night, Tae Wook
Yoon walked by a letter in the living room accepting him into a
military academy, and his dream of becoming a law-enforcement agent
still seemed a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   But hours later, after a losing night at the pool tables with
friends, the police said, Yoon did something antithetical to that
dream: putting a gun to the neck of a scared livery-cab driver, and
then, with the jerk of a finger, ending the man's life.
</P>
<P>
   The bullet that killed the driver, Hyong Kyu Kim, also traveled
through Yoon's arm, sending him to North Shore University Hospital
in Manhasset, N.Y., where he was arrested. He later told the police
that he and his three friends had decided to rob a cabdriver in
Bayside, Queens, to pick up some cash for pool games, said
investigators speaking on condition of anonymity. They added that
he said the gun went off accidentally, the mistake of a novice.
</P>
<P>
   Yoon, 16, and two friends now face charges of murder and
attempted robbery. One of the friends, Samuel Chung, 17, a student
at Bayside High School, was arrested Thursday morning, and the
other, Eric Chi, 16, a student at Stuyvesant High School in
Manhattan, was taken to the 111th Precinct station house in Bayside
Friday afternoon by his lawyer, the investigators said. A fourth
suspect, a 15-year-old who attends Valley Forge Military Academy in
Pennsylvania, had not been arrested, and the Queens district
attorney's office was negotiating with his lawyer, the
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Yoon's father, Won Yoon, said Friday that he was heartbroken
that instead of helping his son prepare for his entrance into
Valley Forge, he was now searching for a lawyer to help keep him
out of prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a bad dream,'' said the elder Yoon, who recently
opened a Korean restaurant in Flushing, where the family lives. He
added that he believed that his son's friends were responsible for
the crime. ``He is a good kid, a bright kid, active in sports. He
wanted to be an FBI agent, that's why he was going to Valley
Forge,'' the father said. ``But he started hanging out with these
bad friends and started getting into fights. He said he couldn't
control himself.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``My wife and I are so sorry that this happened to
this man.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and family members said Yoon's change from a bright
young boy to a murder suspect happened gradually. Yoon never missed
Sunday services at the local Baptist church and was a star athlete
at school, winning a trophy for his abilities on the track. He was
a friend to the neighbors who had watched him grow up on Georgia
Avenue, friends and family members said.
</P>
<P>
   He had been an excellent student at the Bronx High School for
Science, but he began cutting classes about a year ago and started
hanging out with several other youths he met at two pool halls in
Queens, according to family members, friends and school records.
</P>
<P>
   Yoon emulated some of his new friends in sporting a bright
yellow streak in his hair, a common emblem of the gang called
Korean Power, the police and friends said.
</P>
<P>
   Yoon told his parents that many of his problems were related to
the school and that he did not fit in there. They transferred him
to Francis Lewis High School in Flushing in February. But the
problems continued, and he was put on a list of chronic truants,
school officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was shy, and said he was getting picked on because he was a
new face,'' Won Yoon said. ``He said he just didn't want to go to
school.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager's friends had troubles similar to his own,
according to school records. Chung was failing every class, while
Chi was suspected of being a gang member.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jacob Burke, 17, a friend of Yoon's, said he asked Yoon a few
weeks ago whether he was involved in the Korean Power gang. ``He
said that he'd thought about it, but was not a member yet,'' Burke
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He said he also asked about Yoon's friends, who were ``just
aggressive, thinking they were big and bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke added, ``When he told me that his group was getting into a
lot of fights with other Korean kids, I told him that it just
wasn't worth the pain and agony.''
</P>
<P>
   The police said Yoon hatched the robbery plot with his friends
late Tuesday night. As Wednesday morning approached, Yoon phoned
Twin ABC Call Taxi in Flushing and asked that a car pick him up at
a pool hall. Kim arrived and drove Yoon to 47th Avenue and 206th
Street in Bayside. Yoon pulled out a gun and demanded money, the
district attorney's office said.
</P>
<P>
   A shot rang out as Yoon's friends left their own car in the
shadows and began to approach the idling livery cab, the police
said. They added that all four suspects fled as Kim, a recent
immigrant who was trying to make enough money to bring his wife
from Korea, lay dying.

KARROS' HOMER BEATS ROCKIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Eric Karros knows breaking even just isn't going to do
for the Dodgers. It isn't going to help catch the San Diego Padres
and it certainly won't let manager Bill Russell keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   So for the second night in a row, Karros made the difference,
hitting a 10th-inning homer Friday night to give the Dodgers a 4-3
victory over the Colorado Rockies in front of 48,120 at Coors
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Karros could see things slipping away when the Colorado Rockies
tied the game with two runs in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   But as he did Thursday with five RBI that included a three-run
homer, Karros took control. With three regulars sidelined, Gary
Sheffield ejected and Raul Mondesi still wobbly playing with a
sprained left ankle, Karros surprisingly got a fastball from Jerry
DiPoto (2-3).
</P>
<P>
   He drove it 422 feet and hobbled around the bases on a left knee
he says is getting better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last few days I've had more mobility with the knee,''
Karros told broadcaster Rick Monday on the Dodgers post-game show.
``I don't know if it is a coincidence or not, but I feel much
better at the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   No Dodger felt very good after closer Scott Radinsky allowed a
two-run pinch single by Greg Colbrunn in the eighth that tied the
score 3-3 and ruined seven strong innings by starter Darren
Dreifort.
</P>
<P>
   The runs belonged to Greg McMichael, who came in to start the
eighth, but the pressure has been on Russell and Radinsky after a
shaky month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anyone else to put out there,'' Russell said.
``But he is still throwing hard and with good movement. He's just
having trouble finding the strike zone. He'll keep going out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't seem so bad after Karros' homer. Antonio Osuna (3-0)
struck out three in the 10th, including fastball-loving Vinny
Castilla to end the game. Osuna threw a fist in the air and
motioned Castilla back to the Rockies dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies, now 11-22 at home, were forced to put reigning NL
MVP Larry Walker on the disabled list with pain in his surgically
repaired right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna's move was a little trashy, but the Dodgers know what it
is like to be down.
</P>
<P>
   Still tinkering with their makeshift lineup, the Dodgers
re-acquired 1B/OF Matt Luke from Cleveland, which released him, and
designated outfielder Thomas Howard for assignment. The move was
designed to give Karros some relief for his knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This season is a long process,'' executive vice president Fred
Claire said. ``I don't know if any team has been through what we've
been through and it isn't even July. You hope to get to the point
where you are four games over, then six and eight and able to put
everything else aside.''
</P>
<P>
   For the third consecutive game, Russell used a lineup without
slumping third baseman Bobby Bonilla and injured second baseman
Eric Young. The Dodgers also were playing without catcher Charles
Johnson, who missed the first of two games to attend his
grandmother's funeral in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort was coming off a 4-2 loss to the Rockies last Saturday
and didn't start Friday's game much better.
</P>
<P>
   He walked Neifi Perez to lead off the bottom of the first and,
one batter later, hit Dante Bichette with a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   An RBI single by Ellis Burks gave the Rockies a 1-0 lead. They
then loaded the bases when Todd Helton walked, but Dreifort pitched
out of the jam when third baseman Paul Konerko made a back-handed
stop and touched the bag to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Holding the Rockies to just one run seemed to help Dreifort
refocus.
</P>
<P>
   For the next five innings, he retired 14 of 15 hitters. Helton
was the only one to reach when he singled with one out in the
third, but he was erased on a double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the second straight game I had trouble at the
beginning,'' Dreifort said. ``When I got to the dugout after the
first, they got me to relax and refocus. It seemed to help. Plus
the defense was great.''
</P>
<P>
   By the sixth, the Dodgers led 3-1. Roger Cedeno, who ran the
Dodgers out of a first-inning rally trying to take third on a
grounder to short, singled with one out in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Vizcaino took a called third strike, but Sheffield drilled
Astacio's first pitch into the left-field stands.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sheffield's 11th homer and fifth as a Dodger.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers added their third run in the sixth after stringing
together four consecutive hits with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Konerko was first, singling to right. After starting the trip 2
for 11, Konerko went 2 for 3 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Prince, playing in place of Johnson, followed with another
single to right and Castro loaded the bases by grounding a single
between short and third.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort came in batting just .160, but he singled to left to
score Konerko and give the Dodgers a 3-1 lead.

<P>
   CONGRESS-CAMPAIGN (Washington) _ In a significant test of
strength, the coalition supporting bipartisan legislation to
overhaul the campaign finance law won a series of House votes on
Friday and drew an unexpectedly large number of Republicans to its
side. On one key test, 65 Republicans voted to preserve the
legislation sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and
Martin Meehan, D-Mass. The bill is one of a dozen proposals up for
consideration in a free-for-all over the campaign finance laws. By
Alison Mitchell.

<P>
   CHUNG-DEMS-FUNDS (Washington) _ Not long after Johnny Chung and
his checkbook were welcomed into Democratic fund-raising circles,
some senior party officials worried that he posed a potential
problem. As early as March 1995, the Democratic National
Committee's finance director, Richard Sullivan, said, he raised the
possibility that Chung was a conduit for illegal foreign money from
China. By Don Van Natta Jr.

   MIAMI-CORRUPT (Miami) _ Bribery. Kickbacks. Voter fraud.
Cover-up. Even as law-enforcement officials promise more arrests,
the city of Miami is now engulfed in a series of high-profile
investigations that have uncovered a wave of such pervasive public
corruption it is now often mentioned in the same breath as New York
during its Tammany Hall days. By Mireya Navarro.
</P>
<P>
   SPOCK-DIET-HEALTH (Undated) _ The late Dr. Benjamin Spock,
arguably the most influential pediatrician of all time, has left
children and their parents with a surprising and rather demanding
legacy: advice that they stick to a vegetarian diet devoid of all
dairy products after the age of 2. In the seventh edition of his
world-famous book, ``Baby and Child Care,'' issued last month by
Pocket Books just weeks after his death at age 94, he recommends an
approach to childhood nutrition that many experts, including his
co-author, Dr. Steven J. Parker, consider too extreme and likely to
result in nutritional deficiencies. By Jane Brody.
</P>
<P>
   PRESBY-GUNS (Undated) Striking an unusually personal note in the
national debate on gun control, the top policy-making body of the
Presbyterian Church (USA) has passed a resolution calling on the
denomination's 2.6 million members to ``work toward removing
handguns and assault weapons'' from their homes and communities.
Presbyterian officials and other church leaders said the assembly's
resolution takes a new tack in asking directly for individual
action by church members, rather than seeking governmental
legislation. By Gustav Niebuhr.

   NY-DEAF-MEXICANS (New York) _ The 49 deaf Mexican men and women
whose ordeal as virtual slaves in a quiet Queens County
neighborhood shocked New York and attracted national attention will

   MEDICARE-GUIDE (Washington) _ In an abrupt change of plans,
Clinton administration officials said on Friday that they would
restrict the initial distribution of a new consumer guide on the
Medicare program because they feared that millions of elderly
people would be utterly confused by its description of new health
insurance options. By Robert Pear.

<P>
   BRILL-ARTICLE (Undated) _ If Steven Brill had simply written an
opinion column for his new magazine, condemning the news media for
their conduct in the coverage of the Monica Lewinsky investigation,
Washington might have been able to ignore it. If all he had done
was to get Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, to admit leaking
information to reporters, the storm might have passed after a brief
downpour of headlines. But what Brill did this week in the
inaugural issue of his media review, Brill's Content, was far more
brazen and ultimately subversive of the insular culture of the
nation's big newspapers and networks. By David Firestone. (With

   MANZANAR-NATIONAL-SITE (Lone Pine, Calif.) _ During World War
II, this lonely stretch of scrub off Highway 395 was the largest
outpost between Los Angeles and Reno. It had a Bank of America
branch and a hospital of 250 beds, plus an orphanage, a hog farm
and chicken ranch. But Manzanar was no ordinary town. Behind its
armed guards and barbed wire fences it housed 10,000
Japanese-Americans who were brought here against their will in the
mass hysteria that followed the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. By

of dollars to their annual costs. By Milt Freudenheim.

GONZALEZ OVERPOWERS ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Juan Gonzalez is chasing a major-league record that
has stood for 68 years, but more important than the end result is
what he does along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez increased his major league-leading RBI total to 86 with
a three-run double and a two-run homer Friday night, leading the
Texas Rangers to a 7-3 win over the Angels before 38,866 at Edison
Field.
</P>
<P>
   With the win, the Rangers moved to within one-half game of the
Angels in the AL West, with a chance to regain first place this
afternoon when the teams meet again.
</P>
<P>
   With 86 RBI in 72 games, Gonzalez is on a pace to finish with
194 RBI. Hack Wilson set the record with 190 in 1930. Friday night
marked the fifth time this season Gonzalez has had five RBI in a
game.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Gonzalez can continue his record march remains to
be seen, but he came up big when the Rangers needed it Friday.
Gonzalez came to the plate to face Chuck Finley with the bases
loaded, two out and the game tied at 2 in the top of the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Finley got ahead in the count 1-2 before Gonzalez ripped a line
drive into the right-center field gap, scoring all three. It broke
Gonzalez's first notable RBI drought of the season _ going into
Friday's game, Gonzalez had only one RBI in his previous seven
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw him two splitters in the dirt that he swung at and
missed,'' Finley said. ``I thought there was no way he'd be looking
for a fastball off the plate. I thought there was no way he could
get it, and if he did, it would be a ground ball to second. But
he's so big and strong, it went all the way to the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing you do is you tend to second-guess yourself.
But I won't do that. I made a good enough pitch to get eight other
guys in the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez got the opportunity to hurt Finley only because Angels
first baseman Cecil Fielder had booted a ground ball for the second
time in the game. His error in the fourth inning led to an unearned
run for the Rangers, but the one on Luis Alicea's grounder in the
seventh proved more costly.
</P>
<P>
   That gave the Rangers runners on first and second with one out,
but Finley struck out Roberto Kelly for out No. 2. Finley then
walked Rusty Greer, loading the bases for Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Fielder had not made any errors in his 40 previous starts going
into Friday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't the first time and it ain't going to be the last,''
Fielder said of his errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's got as good of hands as any first baseman in the
game,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``Tonight was just one
of those nights.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth inning, Gonzalez hit a 400-foot line drive over the
fence in left-center off Shigetoshi Hasegawa for his 22nd homer and
a 7-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I was patient,'' Gonzalez said of his big night.
``When I'm patient, I do well. I have a lot of concentration,
especially with men on base. It's important. It's my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers starter Rick Helling (10-3) tied teammate Aaron Sele for
the league league in victories by going seven-plus innings and
allowing three runs and nine hits, including Jim Edmonds' 14th
homer of the year. Helling struck out five and walked none.
</P>
<P>
   Finley (7-4) got the loss, his second in less than a week to
Helling and the Rangers. Helling beat Finley 4-2 last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Finley could not be blamed for this one, however. He went 62/3
innings, allowing five runs and six hits. But because of Fielder's
errors, only one run was earned.

DEMOCRAT CITES EARLY SUSPICION OVER DONATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs for additions and refinements; changes throughout)  (lh) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Not long after Johnny Chung and his checkbook were
welcomed into Democratic fund-raising circles, some senior party
officials worried that he posed a potential problem.
</P>
<P>
   There were suspicions that Chung, a struggling California
businessman, was using the White House to raise consulting fees
from the Chinese business executives whom he escorted to
fund-raising events in Los Angeles and Washington. The Democratic
National Committee's finance director, Richard Sullivan, said that
as early as March 1995 he raised the possibility that Chung was a
conduit for illegal Chinese money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a sense that he might be taking money from them and then
giving it to us, you know,'' Sullivan said in his deposition with
Senate investigators last year.
</P>
<P>
   But those concerns apparently did not prevent the Democrats from
accepting a $125,000 check from Chung, which led to access for him
and several Chinese businessmen to a dinner at the home of
filmmaker Steven Spielberg. Not long after that check cleared, the
Democratic National Committee chairman, Donald Fowler, said the
``Democratic Party is lucky to have'' Chung.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Fowler and other leading Democrats say they feel
betrayed by Chung, who embarrassed them again last month when it
was revealed that he told federal investigators that he had
funneled nearly $100,000 from a Chinese military officer to the
Democrats in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Chung's account represents the first hard evidence of what
Republicans said was a plan by China to influence the U.S.
presidential election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats and White House officials repeatedly asked Chung
for money and never said no to any of Chung's contributions leading
up to the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Chung pleaded guilty to campaign-related bank and
tax fraud charges. He is to be sentenced July 20. While cooperating
with the Justice Department's campaign finance inquiry, Chung has
described for federal investigators his view of what Democratic
fund-raisers knew _ and should have known _ about his
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Brian A. Sun, Chung's lawyer, confirmed that Chung had given
detailed briefings about his conversations with Democratic Party
officials to investigators, but he refused to divulge any details.
</P>
<P>
   There was no secret among Democratic officials that Chung was
aggressively promoting his fax business, Automated Intelligent
Systems Inc. He asked both the party and the White House to hire
his company. (Both declined.) And at nearly every fund-raising
event he attended, Chung had escorted Chinese business people who
were anxious to meet the president.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Chung feels stung that the Democrats have blamed him for
the troubles that he brought to the party, Sun said. ``What is
troubling to Mr. Chung is the suggestion that the DNC was a victim
in this,'' he said. ``The DNC's fund-raisers were willing
participants.''
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Kadzik, a lawyer for the Democratic committee, said
that any accusations by Chung against party fund-raisers are
``baseless.'' He said there was no reason for party leaders to ever
suspect that Chung's donations came from anyone other than him. He
said Chung, as he awaits sentencing, ``has every reason to point
his finger at others.''
</P>
<P>
   Chung and his company gave the Democrats a total of $366,000,
all of which has been returned because of questions about its
origins. And nearly $100,000 of that money, he recently told
federal investigators, originated with Liu Chao Ying, the Chinese
military officer whom he escorted to meet President Clinton at a
Los Angeles fund-raising dinner in July 1996.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   His associates recall a Los Angeles fund-raiser on Sept. 21,
1995, when two party fund-raisers asked Chung for $70,000 before
they permitted him to bring three guests, including a Chinese beer
company executive, to meet Clinton at a private reception.
</P>
<P>
   Chung agreed to give the money, and he and his guests were
permitted to meet with Clinton. But two months later, Chung still
had not donated the money he had pledged. Ari Swiller, a party
official, asked Fowler to call Chung and ask for the money,
according to an internal Democratic committee memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell him if he does not complete his commitment, ASAP, bad
things will happen,'' Swiller wrote to Fowler in a memo Nov. 10,
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a tongue-in-cheek comment between the chairman and
me,'' Swiller said. ``In no way did I mean any threat to come upon
Johnny.''
</P>
<P>
   Chung got his first taste of political gift-giving in the summer
of 1994 when he attended the president's 48th birthday party, a
fund-raising event. He donated $10,000 and brought several
associates to the party, and was given status as a ``DNC trustee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when Johnny realized that if you make a donation, you
get something in return,'' Sun said.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1995, Chung planned on bringing five Chinese business
executives to Washington. He asked for a meeting with Clinton, a
meeting with Vice President Gore, lunch at the White House mess,
permission to attend the president's weekly radio address, and
other perks.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a White House tour, the request was rejected by
Sullivan, whom Chung described as his ``primary contact'' at the
Democratic National Convention in his proffer given last summer to
the Senate committee investigating campaign finance abuses. Indeed,
Sullivan referred the matter to Fowler, who helped make
arrangements for Chung and the Chinese delegation to attend the
radio address.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, then the finance director, has said in the Senate
deposition that he felt ``uncomfortable'' about Chung because he
kept bringing Chinese businessmen to fund-raising events.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan declined to comment for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Stymied by the Democratic committee, Chung took his request to
the first lady's office. He handed over a check for $50,000 to the
First Lady's then chief of staff, Margaret Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The president told aides that he regretted that Chung was able
to get several Chinese businessmen into his radio address.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1995, Scott Pastrick, the party treasurer, asked Chung
for more money. Chung agreed to write the party a $125,000 check,
which paid for seats at a fund-raising dinner at Spielberg's home.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, Chung again attended a Democratic
fund-raiser, this one for the Clinton-Gore campaign in California.
Chung, who took 19 guests to the $1,000-a-plate dinner, gave a
check for at least $20,000, but he was later told he needed 20
separate $1,000 checks.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, Chung rounded up checks from his employees and
friends, but he reimbursed them for their contributions. Although a
campaign worker had warned Chung not to do that, Sun argued that
the fund-raisers had to know that Chung had no choice. ``At that
time, Johnny doesn't understand the vagaries of campaign finance
law,'' Sun said.
</P>
<P>
   In the next year, Chung would give another $100,000, and be
asked to give much more, Sun said. Speaking of Democratic
fund-raisers, Chung's lawyer said, ``These guys would have been a
lot smarter if they just fessed up and said they just wanted
Johnny's money and got carried away.''

LIBERTY LOSES TO SPARKS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Liberty can not wait to get home, not after opening its
Women's National Basketball Association season with four losses in
five games. Its trip to nowhere ended in Inglewood, Calif., Friday
night, with a 78-75 loss to Los Angeles at the Great Western
Forum. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Leslie scored 19 points and set a WNBA record with 21
rebounds in leading the Sparks. Haixia Zheng had 19 for Los Angeles
(2-2). The Liberty was led by Sophia Witherspoon, who had 18
points. Rebecca Lobo and Vickie Johnson had 17 each, and Kym
Hampton had 15. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty was playing for the second straight night, having
defeated Sacramento by 64-48 on Thursday. It had lost its first
three games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing by 12 points at halftime, the Liberty rallied to
tie the game at 55-55 with 9 minutes 30 seconds remaining in the
game. The Liberty closed to within 2, at 55-53, with 10:04
remaining when Witherspoon drove the lane to score, was fouled and
sank the subsequent free throw. And then Lobo's 8-foot shot tied
the game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sparks then scored seven consecutive points, to go up by
62-55, and led the rest of the way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty was a victim of poor shooting during crunch time.
The team made less than 40 percent of its shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty made just four of its first 18 shots and went
8-for-30 at halftime. Witherspoon (1-for-7), Hampton (1-for-5) and
Lobo (1-for-4) all shot poorly. The Liberty missed all five of its
3-point attempts. And the Liberty had just two offensive rebounds
in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Theresa Weatherspoon landed hard when fouled with 15.3 seconds
remaining in the game, and though she stayed in to shoot her free
throws, she was limping noticeably. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty returns to Madison Square Garden for its home opener
Sunday against Utah. The team will also play at the Garden on
Tuesday against Cleveland and on Friday against Sacramento.  &QL;
</P>

JOHNSON OF OLD STOPS M'S FIVE-GAME SKID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A couple of innings into Randy Johnson's latest start
of a tortuous season Friday night at the Kingdome, Oakland
outfielder Jack Voigt asked teammate and former Mariner Mike
Blowers for a read on the Big Unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike made a comment: `He's on a mission,''' Voigt said. ``I
fully agreed.''
</P>
<P>
   So did 33,212 fans who couldn't have been quite sure what they
were going to get, as well as a clubhouse full of Mariners. What
materialized was a 9-1 Seattle victory born of Johnson's eight-hit,
12-strikeout performance over eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   While there is plainly some fan skepticism over Johnson's
motivation this year, it was never in evidence. When he took the
mound, he was greeted without a boo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was awesome,'' said catcher John Marzano. ``Randy was
Randy.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy as Randy, 1998, means you reach into a vast grab bag. On
this night, he had the mid-90s fastball and the blistering slider
and he pitched inside just enough to make it all the more
effective.
</P>
<P>
   The game might have meant more to Mariner management than it did
to the Mariners. The club has insisted it won't trade Johnson (6-6)
in this fractious, on-again, off-again season, which might be mere
lip service. At least, after a personal three-game losing streak in
which Johnson had yielded 14 earned runs, the brass knows it still
has something marketable.
</P>
<P>
   Marzano, backup to Dan Wilson, caught him for the second time as
a Mariner. It seems Johnson threw in the bullpen twice since his
7-3 loss to the A's last Saturday, caught both times by Marzano,
and subsequently, Johnson asked to have Marzano stay with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that has success,'' Lou Piniella, the Mariner
manager, said dryly, ``has a chance of continuing.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella and pitching coach Stan Williams also worked earlier
this week with Johnson on a mechanical refinement, trying to get
him to be less upright on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk to Randy about that,'' Piniella said. Nobody did, because
Johnson isn't entertaining reporters these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pitched inside real well,'' Piniella said. ``That's one of
the things we talked about. It made his slider more effective.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners made economic use of seven hits, the most damaging
a first-pitch grand slam by David Segui off Oakland starter Blake
Stein in the second inning. To that point, the M's were 7-for-53
(.132) with the bases loaded in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys write that B.S.,'' Segui scoffed. ``We don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Ken Griffey Jr. parked his 28th homer to stay within
shouting distance of St. Louis' Mark McGwire (33), and Alex
Rodriguez had his 25th, each to the opposite field.
</P>
<P>
   But what made almost as much difference as Johnson was the fact
that for a night, the M's discovered a club that kicked the ball
around as much as they do.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland shortstop Miguel Tejada gifted the Mariners a six-pack
of runs all by himself as the M's took a 7-0 lead after two
innings. A three-run first should have been one run, but Tejada
muffed a double-play throw from Stein and the M's tacked on two
more.
</P>
<P>
   An inning later, Tejada's leaping relay throw on another
double-play attempt, this one on Rodriguez, went low for an error
and sustained the inning. Griffey and Jay Buhner walked, and Segui
mashed one to straightaway center field, 429 feet away, to break it
open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget it,'' Tejada shrugged philosophically, referring to a
night that would grow to three errors. ``The game is over, right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Blowers, who had two stints with the Mariners, had any
success against Johnson, but he probably won't brag about it. The
third baseman from Spanaway dunked a soft double down the
right-field line, and had two singles that didn't escape the
infield.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Voigt, who struck out three times against
Johnson. He had one nine-pitch at-bat, resulting in a called third
strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``After he threw me the third or fourth fastball, I just
decided, anything that was spinning, I was going to take,'' Voigt
said. ``I didn't think he could locate the slider, and he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him enough to know that tonight, he was on.''
</P>
<P>
   Marzano's second-ever time catching Johnson was less eventful
than the first. Last Aug. 3 in Milwaukee, it was Johnson,
frustrated with himself in a day-long struggle that resulted in a
6-5 victory, who made a barehand catch of a Marzano throw back to
the mound, resulting in a finger problem that later affected him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was intense, really focused,'' Marzano said. ``If he can do
that, he can dominate any team.''

STEWART PAYS TOLL TO RETAIN U.S. OPEN LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Playing and dressing as if he were on another
planet, Payne Stewart continued to set himself apart from the field
at the U.S. Open Friday in a style that was all his own.
</P>
<P>
   He hit a cyprus tree and made birdie. He buried a few balls in
the unkempt rough and slapped another into the grandstand and still
salvaged pars. He bent putts across double-sloped greens and danced
like he was at a Greatful Dead Concert when they lipped the cup and
dropped in.
</P>
<P>
   But then the unreality and gravity of the Olympic Club Lake
Course finally began to exact its toll. Holding a five-stroke lead
at one point, Stewart slipped from 7-under to 3-under on the back
nine, capped by one of the strangest birdie attempts ever witnessed
by Stewart or anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting pin-high with eight feet to go for a four-stroke lead,
Stewart's birdie try on 18 slipped around the hole, gently rolled
at an angle down the severe slope of the green and didn't stop
until he had a 25-footer coming back uphill. He missed, made bogey
and then ran up to the clubhouse with a slim one-stroke lead over
Jeff Maggert and Bob Tway.
</P>
<P>
   Putt-putt greens are more forgiving, and Stewart immediately
complained about the pin placement to the United States Golf
Association marshal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do expect to walk off there with a par,'' Stewart said of
the mystifying putt on 18. ``I thought it was going to stop two
feet from the hole, and the rest is history.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing his trademark plaid knickers and jaunty red cap, Stewart
certainly could not be mistaken for someone who was ready to
tighten up like the rest of the first-round leaders at the fabled
course. But the putt on 18 put a damper on his good vibrations,
which began with three straight birdies.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart declared the pin placement on 18 to be ``almost
illegal'' and ``bordering on the ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching the Putt-Putt Championship on ESPN before I
started the round, and it resembles that a lot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state native Kirk Triplett had a similar putt not
long after Stewart's, and he stopped the ball from rolling back
with his putter _ an infraction that cost him a two-stroke penalty
and put him well out of contention to make the cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the last frustration of a frustrating day,'' Triplett
said of his action. Had he made the cut, the USGA likely would have
disqualified him.
</P>
<P>
   On the more normal side of the spectrum, the day also belonged
to button-downed 19-year-old U.S. Amateur champ Matt Kuchar, who
had four birdies to go with one bogey, a double bogey and the rest
pars to finish the first two rounds at 1-under.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar, the Georgia Tech junior-to-be who captivated crowds with
his 21st-place finish at the Masters, served notice that he's no
fluke.
</P>
<P>
   With fans calling out, ``Go Kooch,'' his gallery seemed to pay
no attention to the fact that he was playing with defending Open
champ Ernie Els and British Open champ Justin Leonard. If the
new-found adulation and success took some getting used to, Kuchar
wasn't showing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you ever get used to it,'' Kuchar said. ``The
feeling that you get playing golf is different than anything _ the
nervousness and just the feeling of being in contention, especially
here at a major championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar was tied for third place with little-known Lee Porter and
Lee Janzen, whose 4-under-par 66 was the low score of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Porter, of Greensboro, N.C., has spent as much time on the Asian
Tour as he has playing on the PGA Tour but managed to qualify for
his first Open this year. He capped his round with a 112-yard
pitching wedge shot for eagle on the par-4 18th, a shot he counts
among the most memorable of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't think of a better way to end,'' he said,
admitting he was more relieved to make the cut than to be only two
strokes off the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Maggert could understand Stewart's frustrations on a course in
which only four players have managed to break par over 72 holes in
three previous Opens held here in 1955, 1966 and 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much figured the course was going to play like
this,'' Maggert said after shooting consecutive 69s. ``It played
tough in 1987. Just the way the USGA sets it up, I figured that if
I can shoot under par for four days here, I am going to be right
there near the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the short but topsy-turvy and tree-lined Lake
Course took its toll on a number of players who were flirting with
the leaderboard on Thursday. Darkhorse Mark Carnevale, who started
Friday's round in second place at 3-under, double-bogeyed the
394-yard par-4 second hole and then bogeyed No. 4 to slip to even
par. The second hole also claimed Joe Durant, who had been tied
with Carnevale going into Friday's round, and the 10-year
journeyman pro from Pensacola, Fla., fell to 1-over by the end of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, I feel like I played better tee to green
today,'' Durant said. ``I just didn't make the putts I made
yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Course conditions also claimed many of the 20-something stars
who were counted on to do well in this Open.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, picked as one of the favorites to win the tournament in
a pre-Open poll, shot 75 to go with an opening round 71 and didn't
like being upstaged by the likes of Kuchar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do anything very well today,'' Leonard said in a
terse post-round interview.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Couples just barely made the cut after a 5-over 75 Friday
to put him at 147 for the tournament, as did 58-year-old Jack
Nicklaus, playing in his 42nd Open. Nicklaus, who got a special
exemption just to make the original field, needed a 50-foot birdie
putt on 18 to stay alive. Tiger Woods and Leonard also flirted with
elimination at 6-over 146, and Casey Martin qualified, one stroke
ahead of them. The list of those who headed home last night
included 1997 PGA champion Davis Love III, 1996 Open champ Steve
Jones, 1995 Open champ Corey Pavin, Tom Watson, Nick Faldo and
Fuzzy Zoeller.
</P>
<P>
   Even when things were going well, Stewart knew his lead could be
squandered, given the severity of the Lake Course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes back. You know, everything comes back, and in this
championship something right around par is going to be a hell of a
golf score,'' he said.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE WORLD NEEDS A PUBLIC AND SWEATY GESTURE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYON, France _ There cannot be many more grungy acts in the
world than putting on a soggy jersey just removed from somebody
else's sweaty body.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the interests of world peace, that is exactly what
the players from the United States will propose at the conclusion
of their historic game with Iran on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Right out in public: ``Here, feller, here's my shirt. It's a
little heavy right now. I've been wearing it for the last 90
minutes. Nice game. See you down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the glorious tradition of soccer, with players seeking
each other out on the field and exchanging shirts. Exactly the
right gesture between two nations that have not been on speaking
terms for, oh, a couple of decades.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one thing wrong with this picture: Shirt-swapping
is against the official rules of the world soccer body, but we all
know that rules are made to be broken or, at the very least, to be
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a great picture _ the surfer-boy blonds and
African-Americans and buzz-cut Yanks walking off the field in
Iranian game shirts, and the Iranians walking off the field in the
red, white and blue uniforms of the Great Satan itself.
</P>
<P>
   This is the post-game plan formulated by the Yanks, ever since
that capricious, windy evening in Marseilles last fall, when the
United States and Iran were drawn into the same group.
</P>
<P>
   A cosmic joke, perhaps, but one that has taken on importance in
recent days. Did you ever think it would come down to this, nearly
20 years after the hostage crisis in Iran? The sport of soccer,
which causes the eyes of many Americans to go utterly blank, is
suddenly a vital instrument of diplomacy. Then again, remember what
a few games of table tennis did for relationships between the
United States and China.
</P>
<P>
   It is surely no coincidence that President Clinton and Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright have issued open gestures of
rapprochement to Iran. What better time than when the whole world
is watching?
</P>
<P>
   The players insist that this is merely a game, that they have no
political motivation against Iran. They do have considerable soccer
motivation, however, since they need a victory over Iran to have
any chance to advance into the second round of this World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   After a wimpy and shoddy performance against Germany, in which
they lost, 111-53, in basketball numerology, the Yanks have no
reason to be overconfident, or even confident, against Iran. The
Iranians can run all day and kick ankles just like anybody else in
the world. People back home should know this. Expect nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the potential humiliation for the world's most
powerful nation (except on the soccer field), there is room for
some positive posturing that could nudge citizens and leaders into
a more civil dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Americans back home should turn on ABC early. With any luck, the
network will not be selling beer or soft drinks during the pregame
ceremony, which is always so touching in the stadium. Normally, the
two teams march on the field, side by side, and the captains
exchange banners. Sunday will be a little different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch this space,'' advised Keith Cooper, an official with
FIFA, the world soccer body, who noted that Sunday just happens to
be Fair Play Day.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said that some extraordinary ceremony is planned for the
two teams before the game. An oriental bow? A Levantine-style kiss
on the lips? A European smooch on both cheeks? A hearty Western
handshake? Cooper would not say, but he did say it would be
friendly and brief.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may sound a little naive,'' Cooper said, ``but we plan to
treat this as just like the other 63 games.''
</P>
<P>
   Right. Which is why the U.S. president and the secretary of
state are standing on 10-foot step ladders to wave the olive branch
to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   FIFA's pregame gesture will be fine, but the real gestures will
come after the lads are finished planting cleats in each other's
thighs, as normal. When the final whistle blows, will the Iranians
accept a sweaty shirt from the Yanks?
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to shake hands and offer our shirts,'' said U.S. coach
Steve Sampson.
</P>
<P>
   It is against the rules, Cooper noted, adding, ``We ask them not
to exchange shirts on the field, partially as a matter of
decorum.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexi Lalas questions that legalism. ``What is the point of
that?'' he said. ``Everyone knows we fight for 90 minutes, and
exchanging jerseys is about fair play. I want to give the people
the idea that we are not enemies. We are here to play soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Cooper said the players just might expose
undershirts hawking one sponsor or another, and FIFA cannot have
that kind of commercialism, can it? For another thing, ``We like to
have them off the field as soon as possible for security reasons,''
Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   At the World Cup, the players are encouraged to swap shirts in
the tunnel under the stands. That just will not fly Sunday night.
The world needs to see them meet on the churned-up pitch, pulling
off their own sodden shirts and replacing them with jerseys
drenched with the sweat of an opponent. Then let the two nations
find more hygienic ways of patching things up.

SPORTS COLUMN: NOW AND THEN, US VS. THEM  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hitler showed up at one boxer's bon voyage party and President
Roosevelt told the other boxer, ``Joe, we're depending on those
muscles for America.'' Their bout was promoted as the undercard for
World War II. At the least, it would be the Fight of the Century.
</P>
<P>
   And so, on June 22, 1938, at Yankee Stadium, Joe Louis, the
world heavyweight champion, defended his title against Max
Schmeling. It was a rematch. Schmeling had won the first fight.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty years later _ even with Muhammad Ali's refusal to be
drafted and the Mexico City Olympics intervening _ that second
Louis-Schmeling fight seems somehow out of a sporting past too
quaint to comprehend. Sunday, as the United States soccer team
plays Iran in the first round of the World Cup, most fans are hard
put to dredge up more than a passion just for soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes representing Nike versus Reebok, OK, but representing
ideologies? How could our fathers and grandfathers buy such hype?
Louis was the first African-American heavyweight since Jack Johnson
who was allowed to get close to that symbol of ultimate manhood,
the heavyweight crown. He was beautiful to watch; he had fast hands
that threw short punches in furious combinations. But it was his
willingness to act the mumbling, nonthreatening Negro who never
openly chased white women or gloated over fallen white men that got
him fights with white contenders.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Brown Bomber (also called the Sepia Slugger, the
Dark Destroyer and the Tan Tornado) beat Max Baer in 1935, he was a
symbol for African-Americans. From his strength, according to the
writer Richard Wright, ``they took strength, and in that moment all
fear, all obstacles were wiped out, drowned.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis believed his press. He was unbeatable, the ``bushmaster,''
according to the premier sportswriter Grantland Rice, with ``the
instinctive speed of the wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis brought golf clubs to camp while training for his first
fight against Schmeling, in 1936. A former world heavyweight
champion, Schmeling had been disowned by the Third Reich after
losing to Baer, who was Jewish. But after Schmeling pounded Louis
for 12 rounds before dropping him, Goebbels declared the fight a
``splendid patriotic achievement.'' Schmeling sailed home
triumphant and Louis slipped offstage to plot his return.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hitler flexed his muscles in the so-called Nazi
Olympics of 1936, a spectacle of pageantry that became the standard
for all the Games to come. American groups, including the Amateur
Athletic Union, had tried to stop U.S. participation, based on
clear violations of the Olympic charter _ non-Aryans had been
excluded from German teams. But Avery Brundage, the U.S. Olympic
chief, called his critics Communists and prevailed in a close vote.
</P>
<P>
   These were the Berlin Games in which Jesse Owens won four gold
medals and was credited with ``embarrassing'' Hitler _ even while
the Nazis dismissed the African-Americans as ``the black
auxilliaries.'' Owens returned to America to run against horses for
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the quintessential example,'' said Harry Edwards, the
Berkeley sociologist who instigated the 1968 Black Power Olympic
protest, ``of how America has historically utilized black athletes,
black celebrities, in ways that were conducive to its broader
political interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards was talking about Louis, too. Schmeling deserved the
next title shot against Jim Braddock, but Louis got it because
American boxing did not want the championship, and all the money it
generated, to leave the country. Political groups were recruited;
better a Negro champion than a Nazi champion.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-nine years ago, June 22, 1937, Louis became the first
black heavyweight champion since Jack Johnson lost the title in
1915. One year later, after three title defenses, he met Schmeling
again. As often happens, the ``steam up'' _ with uniformed American
Nazis marching for Max and gospel choirs singing for Joe and
endless socio-pugilistic pontification _ was better than the fight.
A breathless crowd of 70,000 paid a million dollars to watch Louis
hammer Schmeling helpless in the first and only round.
</P>
<P>
   Louis, who had been, according to Paul Gallico, ``a primitive
puncher just emerging from the pit,'' was now, in the words of
Jimmy Cannon, ``a credit to his race, the human race.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis did more for others, as affirmation and inspiration, than
he was able to do for himself in later life. The cost of living a
double life _ Louis chased all women and repressed a lively
personality and a racial consciousness _ included drug addiction
and madness. Sometimes sitting in a wheelchair, he greeted
customers to a Las Vegas casino. He died in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Schmeling, who served in the German paratroopers during the war,
became a wealthy businessman. It would be reported, years later,
that he was privately anti-Nazi and had hidden the children of a
Jewish friend. He is still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Each new generation is supposed to make its own lessons from the
past. So maybe we can learn about Joe from the Chinese kids who
rooted for Michael, and the soccer fans who watched Germany
overwhelm the United States last week and will watch the United
States against Iran on Sunday.

COMMENTARY: THE JOKE'S ON HIM  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Have you heard the one about John McCain?
</P>
<P>
   The famously noble politician got up at a Republican fund-raiser
last week and made a now-infamously ignoble joke.
</P>
<P>
   He is so revered by the press that his disgusting jape was
largely nudged under the rug. ``It's like a return to the Kennedy
era,'' said one magazine editor. ``He makes a gaffe, and we look
the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of Washington is the story of why smart people do dumb
things. And why pols can swing fitfully between doing the right
thing and doing the wrong thing.
</P>
<P>
   McCain made it through five years of torture in North Vietnam.
The Arizona senator has also been brave in Washington, inciting the
wrath of his party and powerful lobbies with quixotic battles for
the best causes: campaign finance reform and making Big Tobacco
kick its habit of marketing to kids.
</P>
<P>
   In a capital where politicians follow more than lead, McCain has
been an edifying exception. Even though his independent streak and
quick temper have made him Republican enemies, his idealism and
easy way with the press got him on the short list for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   So how does such a lofty figure sink to the basement?
</P>
<P>
   The joke that he thought was funny was about Chelsea Clinton,
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the bad boy,'' he said in a phone interview. ``It was
stupid and cruel and insensitive. I've apologized. I can't take it
back. I could give you a whole bunch of excuses, but there are no
excuses. I was wrong, but do you want me crucified? How many days
does it need to be a story?''
</P>
<P>
   He said the senator who spoke just before he did to the
Republican fat cats made a tasteless joke about Viagra. ``So I got
up and said, `You think that was a tasteless joke? Listen to this
one.' The minute it came out of my mouth, I thought, `Oh no, this
is a terrible mistake.'''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, defensively, ``I will always maintain a sense of
humor. Life is too short not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Life is also too short for making the president's daughter the
target of a junky, misogynistic crack masquerading as humor.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he wrote a letter of abject apology to the
president. That's good politics. But where's the letter to Janet
Reno? He says he doesn't think that such a letter is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Because the president and McCain have been working together on
the campaign finance and tobacco issues, the White House response
was muted. ``It takes a severe lapse in synapses to make a joke
about personal things like that,'' says Clinton spokesman Mike
McCurry, who has occasionally lost control of his own synapses.
``Most prominent people at one time or another have a close
encounter with the distasteful.''
</P>
<P>
   It is downright weird that McCain would be the one to break the
taboo against cheap shots at the lovely and self-possessed Chelsea.
He said he thought he'd heard the joke on Jay Leno. But Leno, not
one to shrink from the tasteless, protests: ``I've never, ever done
a Chelsea joke, nor would I. Political humor is like the Mafia _
everything's open game as long as you don't go after the
families.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Imus was befuddled by the blunder of one of his favorite
guests. ``It's horrible, yecchhh! This guy is a genuine American
hero. I don't know why they do it. Some idiotic effort to be one of
the guys. Like me at the correspondents' dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm flummoxed. After so many politicians have humiliated
themselves or ruined their careers with stupid ethnic and sex
jokes, from Earl Butz ``joke'' about blacks to Bob Kerrey's
``joke'' about lesbians to Al D'Amato's ``joke'' about Judge Lance
Ito _ why do they keep doing it?
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't stop,'' says Alan Dundes, a folklorist and expert
in the anthropology of humor at Berkeley. ``It's part of the male
arsenal of weapons to make your way in the world. If McCain is
worried about being too liberal for his colleagues, this is one way
of indicating that he's one of the Republican boys _ attacking the
Democratic president by attacking his women. Since ancient times,
you get at your male opponent by violating his women. If the
women's honor is lost, the man's honor is lost. McCain was in the
military. He knows you conquer enemies by feminizing the men and
putting down the women.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain will survive. But he may have learned a lesson about the
politics of virtue. The holier they come, the harder they fall.

COMMENTARY: FIGHTING CITIZEN ABUSE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Richard Emery filed the lawsuit that led to the
transformation of city government several years ago. The Board of
Estimate, controlled to a great extent by Democratic Party bosses,
was abolished and the powers of the mayor and the City Council were
enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Emery said he believes the changes have
worked reasonably well. ``We're seeing our first big budget
battle,'' he said. ``It's over a corollary issue (Yankee Stadium)
but it's a legitimate budget battle, and that's healthy. There's a
genuine balance of power in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   But as a veteran fighter for civil liberties, Emery is always
concerned about the misuse of the tremendous power of government,
those chilling moments when government officials, behind the
protective curtain of the law, trample the rights of the innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Those moments occur more frequently than most of us realize. And
it is with that in mind that Emery is putting together a new law
firm. It will be called Emery, Celli, Brinckerhoff &AMP; Abady and its
chief mission will be to serve as a counterforce to the abusive
practices of government and other large institutions. The intent,
Emery said, is to move aggressively on cases of false arrest,
police brutality, the illegal stifling of dissent and other matters
that amount to what he calls ``citizen abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Emery has long been drawn to those kinds of cases. Soon after
graduating from Columbia Law School in 1970 he founded the
Institutional Legal Services Project in the state of Washington,
where he pushed litigation that led to an overhaul of the state's
backward mental commitment law and improvements in notoriously poor
prison conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '70s, as a staff attorney for the New York Civil
Liberties Union, he successfully represented a man who was beaten
and humiliated by the police in a gay bar. In the 1980s he won the
release from prison of Bobby McLaughlin, a Brooklyn man who had
been sentenced to 15 years to life for a murder he didn't commit.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, because of a class-action suit filed by Emery, a
policy of routinely strip-searching suspects accused of minor
offenses in Manhattan and Queens was ended. More than 53,000 people
accused of infractions as minor as driving without a license had
been forced to undergo the humiliating searches.
</P>
<P>
   Emery and his partners in the new firm currently represent a
number of clients who are in legal fights with the Giuliani
administration. They include newsstand operators, many victims of
alleged police abuse, an activist group called Housing Works that
has claimed its criticism of the Mayor led to the illegal
cancellation of its contract with the city, and Public Advocate
Mark Green, who has been stymied in his effort to get data on cops
who were never disciplined despite having excessive-force
complaints substantiated by the Civilian Complaint Review Board.
</P>
<P>
   Emery said, ``We want to have a firm where the people in this
city can come and know they are going to get the best advice and
the best representation with respect to whether their rights are
being violated, whether it's by the city, state or federal
governments, or other major institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the firm is not interested in personal-injury lawsuits.
The primary goal is to curb the abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, ironic that the man primarily responsible for
the most recent increase in the power of the mayoralty is
establishing a law firm to represent the people being steamrolled
by that power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rudy Giuliani is the first mayor since the new charter to
really use all of his powers, and even overuse his powers,'' Emery
said. ``As a lawyer and a very bright, hard-working guy, he has
pushed the envelope.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the mayor has been particularly tough on dissenters,
attacking First Amendment rights in a way that is ``unprecedented
in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   But the courts have been there to defend those rights, he said,
adding: ``It's not easy. We're constantly navigating the shoals of
the court system, trying to find the right theories, the best
theories for holding public officials accountable. Government
policy should not be undermined where it has validity and is being
implemented in a careful, thoughtful, humane way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regrettably, that happens less than all the time.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton crams for his trip to China
this week, he must be yearning for those simpler days, not so long
ago, when it was much easier to explain to Americans the
distinction between friends and foes in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   During the first Clinton presidential campaign, the Chinese
government was the menace, run by dictators ``coddled'' by
President George Bush as they oppressed Tibet, threatened Taiwan,
forced abortions and swiped U.S. technology. Then there was Japan,
America's biggest military ally and partner in Asia. Sure, the
Japanese kept out U.S. car parts and computer chips, barriers that
Clinton vowed to smash. But whenever trade quarrels got really
nasty, cooler heads in Washington would remind people that it was
Japan _ market oriented and host to U.S. troops _ that Washington
could count on in times of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But no one then could imagine the kind of crisis Asia faces
today: economic meltdown. And if you listen closely to the oratory
of Washington before the most important foreign trip of Bill
Clinton's presidency, things sound very different. Tuesday,
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin took to the podium of the White
House to declare that ``China has been an island of stability in
Asia'' _ a savvy, responsible player in the global effort to tamp
down the economic firestorm that started in Asia a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   And Japan? The view from Washington these days is that it is
spreading the bubonic plague of the markets _ wild instability _
while refusing to take the cure. When Rubin went to the Oval Office
on Monday night to tell Clinton that the United States had to
reverse policy, spending billions in the currency markets to prop
up the yen, he described it as a desperation effort to save Japan
from itself. Inside the Treasury, his aides have a new title for
Japanese Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga: Minister for the
Destruction of the World Economy.
</P>
<P>
   This huge shift in perspective is not universal, of course. Many
in Congress still view China as a security threat, and last week
they kicked into high gear the hearings over whether the Chinese
are exploiting liberalized U.S. commercial export laws to improve
their spy satellites and nuclear missiles. Not surprisingly, the
White House is drafting and re-drafting the remarks Clinton will
deliver in China to make sure he presses the themes of human rights
and nonproliferation.
</P>
<P>
   In calm times this would be a delicate balancing act. But it is
made far more complex by the realities of Asia's economic turmoil.
China may remain America's huge military threat, but it has emerged
in recent months as an equally huge economic ally _ insuring, at
least for now, that crisis does not become catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   And Japan, home to the U.S. bases that keep Chinese power in
check, has become an economic drunk driver. Its steps to deregulate
the economy, reform its banks and cut taxes are widely viewed as
inadequate, and no one even talks anymore about turning Japan into
an engine of Asian recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you run a country or a company, you better figure out
how to live without Japan for a while,'' says Morgan Stanley Asia
chairman John Wadsworth.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally the Chinese see this an opportunity. In return for a
pledge to hold their currency stable _ which President Clinton is
expected to seek this week, and which is in China's interest anyway
_ they want acknowledgment of China as the new economic leader of
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   That's a stretch (China's economy is still a fifth the size of
Japan's) but nothing makes the Chinese happier than when U.S.
officials repeat Rubin's mantra that ``sometime in the next century
China will be the world's largest economy.'' After all, a decade
ago the Japanese thought that trophy would belong to them.
</P>
<P>
   China's constant reminders of U.S.-Chinese cooperation in World
War II, fighting side-by-side against you-know-who, are part of a
campaign to portray China as Asia's leader and America's
indispensable partner. It's no secret why the Chinese insisted that
Clinton only visit China on this trip: They wanted the imagery of
Air Force One flying right past Japan. (To make amends, Japanese
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has been invited to visit
Washington in July.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The stars are lined up for them, because Japan is in such
disfavor around the world,'' said Jeffrey Garten, the dean of the
Yale School of Management. ``They know that we have no one else to
turn to for managing the economic crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Garten suspects the Chinese have a more specific agenda in mind.
They want to swap continued cooperation for America's commitment to
get them into the World Trade Organization and a pledge to draw
back U.S. support for Taiwan. The Chinese have made no secret of
their unhappiness with a revision of the security treaty between
Japan and the United States last year, which they viewed as part of
a broader effort to contain Chinese military power.
</P>
<P>
   It's never been easy for the United States to maintain an
equilibrium in its relations with Japan and China. One has always
been in vogue, the other out. But rarely have things been this
complicated, when U.S. security interests and U.S. economic
interests have pulled in different directions.
</P>
<P>
   And add to that another wrinkle. The Clinton administration is
praising China's economic management today in part to encourage it
to defuse an economic time bomb down the road: China itself.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``China today has the characteristics of every Asian country
that was hit by the crisis _ but worse,'' says Michael Walton, the
director of poverty reduction at the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at some numbers you are not likely to hear President
Clinton rattle off in the next two weeks. Somewhere between 25 and
30 percent of all the loans on the books of Chinese banks are not
being paid back and probably never will be. That means there is now
at least $270 billion in bad debt in China (compared with $600
billion in much richer Japan). Moody's Investor Services warned
Friday that China's big state banks are ``in reality heavily
insolvent.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about those impressive skyscrapers in Shanghai that
Clinton will roar past in his motorcade on the way to a roundtable
with cell-phone-toting Chinese entrepreneurs? Vast numbers of them
are sitting empty. And while the entrepreneurs represent China's
future, up in the industrial northeast unemployment rates are
running near 30 percent. The numbers are getting worse as Zhu
Rongji, China's new prime minister, shuts down vast steel plants
and mines that Mao opened 40 years ago with a bunch of nifty
slogans but no business plan.
</P>
<P>
   So what has protected China from the economic calamity that has
hit its neighbors? A second Great Wall: its currency, which is not
freely convertible. That means the speculators of the world can't
move money freely in and out of China. Sealed off from the markets,
China has sidestepped George Soros and his friends, pegging its
currency to a fixed exchange rate with the dollar. (It helps that
the Chinese have built up a war chest of $150 billion in foreign
reserves.)
</P>
<P>
   But there are ways for the world to get around the wall. As the
dollar has soared, China's exports _ the fuel of its economic
growth _ have become far more expensive overseas. Suddenly the
countries whose currencies have dropped so dramatically _ Korea,
Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia _ are selling goods more cheaply and
cutting into China's market share. And that is reducing China's
growth rate at the moment it desperately needs money to finance its
perilous transition to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
   So it is no surprise that when the Japanese yen fell to scary
new lows last week, the Chinese began to scream. Japan's economy is
so big that it could force another round of huge currency
devaluations _ a second, far more fearsome phase of the Asia
crisis. Chinese leaders began threatening to devalue their own
currency. China's nervousness is one reason Rubin intervened in the
markets to bail out the yen.
</P>
<P>
   But the Treasury secretary made no secret of the fact that he
was forced to select among bad choices. He wanted to force Japan to
make structural changes before he helped the yen _ massive
deregulation, tax cuts, shutting down the sickest banks. The
Chinese, he notes, have addressed their problems far more directly
than Japan has.
</P>
<P>
   What he got last week was a new commitment from Japan _ one that
may or may not be worth any more than previous commitments. If it
isn't, then he has only bought a little time. And sooner or later,
Japan's troubles could become China's _ and the world's.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton crams for his trip to China
this week, he must be yearning for those simpler days, not so long
ago, when it was much easier to explain to Americans the
distinction between friends and foes in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   During the first Clinton presidential campaign, the Chinese
government was the menace, run by dictators ``coddled'' by
President George Bush as they oppressed Tibet, threatened Taiwan,
forced abortions and swiped U.S. technology. Then there was Japan,
America's biggest military ally and partner in Asia. Sure, the
Japanese kept out U.S. car parts and computer chips, barriers that
Clinton vowed to smash. But whenever trade quarrels got really
nasty, cooler heads in Washington would remind people that it was
Japan _ market oriented and host to U.S. troops _ that Washington
could count on in times of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But no one then could imagine the kind of crisis Asia faces
today: economic meltdown. And if you listen closely to the oratory
of Washington before the most important foreign trip of Bill
Clinton's presidency, things sound very different. Tuesday,
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin took to the podium of the White
House to declare that ``China has been an island of stability in
Asia'' _ a savvy, responsible player in the global effort to tamp
down the economic firestorm that started in Asia a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   And Japan? The view from Washington these days is that it is
spreading the bubonic plague of the markets _ wild instability _
while refusing to take the cure. When Rubin went to the Oval Office
on Monday night to tell Clinton that the United States had to
reverse policy, spending billions in the currency markets to prop
up the yen, he described it as a desperation effort to save Japan
from itself. Inside the Treasury, his aides have a new title for
Japanese Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga: Minister for the
Destruction of the World Economy.
</P>
<P>
   This huge shift in perspective is not universal, of course. Many
in Congress still view China as a security threat, and last week
they kicked into high gear the hearings over whether the Chinese
are exploiting liberalized U.S. commercial export laws to improve
their spy satellites and nuclear missiles. Not surprisingly, the
White House is drafting and re-drafting the remarks Clinton will
deliver in China to make sure he presses the themes of human rights
and nonproliferation.
</P>
<P>
   In calm times this would be a delicate balancing act. But it is
made far more complex by the realities of Asia's economic turmoil.
China may remain America's huge military threat, but it has emerged
in recent months as an equally huge economic ally _ insuring, at
least for now, that crisis does not become catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   And Japan, home to the U.S. bases that keep Chinese power in
check, has become an economic drunk driver. Its steps to deregulate
the economy, reform its banks and cut taxes are widely viewed as
inadequate, and no one even talks anymore about turning Japan into
an engine of Asian recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you run a country or a company, you better figure out
how to live without Japan for a while,'' says Morgan Stanley Asia
chairman John Wadsworth.

   Naturally the Chinese see this an opportunity. In return for a

<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember Abraham Maslow, the humanistic psychologist from Psych
101?
</P>
<P>
   He's the fellow who wrote that people are driven to scale a
``hierarchy of needs,'' starting with food and shelter, then
working up through safety, love and esteem to the bell-ringer of
all needs: self-actualization.
</P>
<P>
   ``A musician must make music, an artist must paint, a poet must
write, if he is to be ultimately at peace with himself,'' he wrote.
``What a man can be, he must be.''
</P>
<P>
   That's great for poets and pianists, but what about corporate
assistant vice presidents and human resources coordinators? If
there's meaning in Mozart, why not also serenity in spreadsheets?
</P>
<P>
   These days, people are trying to be all they can and must be at
the office, as the workplace has become an increasingly popular but
elusive spot to look for purpose and fulfillment in life.
</P>
<P>
   This search for meaning didn't appear out of nowhere. In boom
times, prosperous workers can afford to worry about more than the
size of their paychecks. 1980s-era greed still has a bad name.
</P>
<P>
   And baby boomers are hitting an age when the children are moving
out, giving parents time to think about moving up a notch or two on
Maslow's hierarchy. Companies, reaching the limits of downsizing
and re-engineering, have decided that one of the few remaining ways
to get more out of their workers is to help them find purpose..
</P>
<P>
   Just peruse the business shelves of the local bookstore, which
look more and more like the self-help section. ``The Artist's Way
at Work: Riding the Dragon'' (Morrow, 1998) promises ``12 weeks to
creative freedom'' (in week one, dubbed ``Emergence,'' you're
supposed to write three pages of whatever every morning). The back
cover of ``The Search for Meaning in the Workplace'' (Abingdon
Press, 1996) advertises the book as part of a new genre:
``Career/Philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Such books are becoming the latest versions of ``Bartlett's
Famous Quotations,'' often sprinkling in the margins penetrating
insights from Aristotle and Confucius, along with Lee Iacocca and
Malcolm Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   The authors and their corporate cheering section blur the line
between work and life, speaking in a language less English than
corporate-speak. Author Stephen R. Covey, for example, telling
readers how to live effective lives, says they should ``be
proactive,'' ``synergize'' and ``think win-win.''
</P>
<P>
   Want to take a break from work on the golf course? Forget it.
Golf IS work. It is for getting ahead in business and schmoozing
clients, particularly for women who have long felt excluded from
the boy's clubs that rule so many companies (``Breaking the Grass
Ceiling'' is not just bad wordplay but an actual book).
</P>
<P>
   How about escaping with a travel or adventure book? ``Strategy
Safari: a Guided Tour through the Wilds of Strategic Management''
will be published by the Free Press this fall. Thanks to computers,
work and fun are just a trackball click away from each other.
</P>
<P>
   Workers look to chief executives to be moral leaders as much as
stewards of the balance sheet and maximizers of profit. An
increasingly important part of a CEOs job is coining some nifty
phrase or goal to give employees a broader mission than bringing
home a paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   John Welch, the vaunted chairman of General Electric, has for
years preached the virtues of the ``boundaryless'' workplace where
everyone contributes to the entire organization rather than tends
to their own narrow turf.
</P>
<P>
   The recent writings of well-known management gurus like Tom
Peters seem intended to inspire more than educate, though passages
like this one from Peters' ``Circle of Innovation'' (Knopf, 1997)
may simply leave readers perplexed: ``YOU CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT AN
ERASER. Forgetting _ not learning _ is the highest art. Think:
ORGANIZED forgetting. STRATEGIC forgetfulness. How? Cherish WASTE .
. . SILLINESS . . . FAILURE. i.e.: Ready. FIRE! Aim.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporations are also pushing their workers to think about
meaning and purpose. In this tight labor market, many companies
need to show they care about their employees' lives beyond work.
Otherwise, those same employees might jump to competitors who show
they care a bit more about such things.
</P>
<P>
   Even law firms are trying to reduce turnover in the ranks by
offering associates such beyond-the-bottom-line gestures as
paternity leave, according to a recent front-page article in The
National Law Journal.
</P>
<P>
   And if work hasn't quite become a religion, it's starting to
look like one, as hundreds of companies play host to religion
classes to accommodate their time-pressed workers.
</P>
<P>
   With global competition, of course, companies also want their
workers to be all they can be on the job. After all, employers have
re-engineered and downsized, but those changes can do only so much
to help a company's performance, especially when the remaining
workers are exhausted from doing the work of two former colleagues.
So companies hire motivational and inspirational speakers to
recharge their employees' batteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got an energy problem,'' said Richard J. Leider,
author of ``The Power of Purpose: Creating Meaning in Your Life and
Work'' (Berrett Koehler, 1997) and a frequent speaker and adviser
to corporations like American Express, General Motors and Pfizer.
``Many companies are wondering, `How do we attract and renew and
bring out the energy and talents in our people?''' Live to Work
</P>
<P>
   Few would argue that there's anything wrong with encouraging
people to think about the broader meaning of life. But increasingly
the distinction between work and life has blurred. Live to work, or
work to live? With pagers, cellular phones, laptops and electronic
mail, it's increasingly live to work, anytime, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that work is with us on the beach, if we're going to
find happiness and self-actualization on the beach, work is going
to be a part of it,'' said David Reibstein, a professor at the
Wharton Business School who said consulting clients and former
students regularly sent him e-mail messages late at night and in
the early morning.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is work gratifying for a lot of people but the office
provides a greater sense of relaxation, security and appreciation
than home, according to Arlie Russell Hochschild, the author of
``The Time Bind: When Work Becomes Home and Home Becomes Work''
(Metropolitan, 1997). Work is also one of the few addictions in
society that is not only accepted but rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no substitute for hard work,'' Thomas Edison wrote in
1932. The problem these days is that for a lot of people, Edison's
words are literally true.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Did a mysterious motorcyclist use a laser to blind the
chauffeur in the car carrying Diana, Princess of Wales?
</P>
<P>
   Was the chauffeur's blood contaminated with lethal quantities of
carbon monoxide?
</P>
<P>
   Was Diana murdered by the British secret service at the request
of the Royal Family, her car rammed by a white Fiat, which
``disappeared'' at the hands of agents?
</P>
<P>
   Or did she and her lover, Dodi Fayed, fatally stumble into an
underworld feud on their way to meet a drug dealer?
</P>
<P>
   And what about those shots fired from the grassy knoll? (Whoops,
wrong conspiracy.)
</P>
<P>
   Eight months have passed since the Princess of Wales died in
what French authorities have called a straightforward car crash.
But their flat assertions that it was merely an accident have only
encouraged theorists, who are still busily inventing wacky stories.
Diana was pregnant! No, she was snorting cocaine in the back of the
Mercedes! No, the Freemasons killed her, because the tunnel in
which she died was decorated with  &UR; ancient masonic symbols. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, some of the theories, which until recently have been
simmering on the Internet and in the minds of dedicated
conspiracists like Fayed's wealthy father, Mohamed, recently raised
their strange little heads in the documentary ``Diana: Secrets
Behind the Crash,'' which presented a mix of research and
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which was broadcast on the ITV network earlier this
month, reported that the chauffeur, Henri Paul, was a paid agent of
the French secret service whose bank accounts mysteriously
contained more than $160,000 _ even though he earned only $35,000 a
year. It also said that Paul had lethal levels of carbon monoxide
in his blood, raising the possibilities that a) he was poisoned, or
b) his blood sample was nefariously switched after his death.
</P>
<P>
   James Hewitt, the cavalry officer who was Diana's lover, came on
to say that people he believed were connected to either the royal
family or the secret service contacted him during their romance to
warn him off, saying he would end up like a former bodyguard and
confidant of the princess who died in a suspicious motorcycle
accident in 1988. The mysterious callers made it clear, Hewitt
said, that ``it was not conducive to my health to continue the
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Fayed, who owns Harrod's but has little
credibility in Britain, possibly because he argues that the
accident was a plot to prevent Diana from marrying a Muslim. Fayed
has denied that Paul, one of his employees, was drunk, although his
blood alcohol levels far exceeded the legal limit for driving.
Fayed has announced that he is ``99 percent certain'' it was not an
accident at all.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary was greeted here with derision and incredulity.
``I think I'm living in a lunatic asylum,'' said Sir Bernard
Ingham, former spokesman for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
during an ITV debate about the documentary.
</P>
<P>
   The controller of news and current affairs at ITV, Steven
Anderson, brushed aside the criticism. ``If people are truly
satisfied that this was a simple accident, why did 12 million
people watch it?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theories represent a sort of meeting of two needs,'' said
Henry Porter, the London editor of Vanity Fair magazine. ``The
first is the need to provide a spectacular and sensational
martyrdom to match Diana's life. The other is the need, in the case
of Mohamed Fayed, to remove the blame from the Ritz and himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two needs coalesce in a very useful sort of
collaboration. People just can't believe that she died in a
drunk-driving accident. It's too banal, it's too awful and in some
ways it's just not believable.''
</P>
<P>

   LONDON _ Did a mysterious motorcyclist use a laser to blind the
chauffeur in the car carrying Diana, Princess of Wales?
</P>
<P>
   Was the chauffeur's blood contaminated with lethal quantities of
carbon monoxide?
</P>
<P>
   Was Diana murdered by the British secret service at the request
of the Royal Family, her car rammed by a white Fiat, which
``disappeared'' at the hands of agents?
</P>
<P>
   Or did she and her lover, Dodi Fayed, fatally stumble into an
underworld feud on their way to meet a drug dealer?
</P>
<P>
   And what about those shots fired from the grassy knoll? (Whoops,
wrong conspiracy.)
</P>
<P>
   Eight months have passed since the Princess of Wales died in
what French authorities have called a straightforward car crash.
But their flat assertions that it was merely an accident have only
encouraged theorists, who are still busily inventing wacky stories.
Diana was pregnant! No, she was snorting cocaine in the back of the
Mercedes! No, the Freemasons killed her, because the tunnel in
which she died was decorated with  &UR; ancient masonic symbols. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, some of the theories, which until recently have been
simmering on the Internet and in the minds of dedicated
conspiracists like Fayed's wealthy father, Mohamed, recently raised
their strange little heads in the documentary ``Diana: Secrets
Behind the Crash,'' which presented a mix of research and
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which was broadcast on the ITV network earlier this
month, reported that the chauffeur, Henri Paul, was a paid agent of
the French secret service whose bank accounts mysteriously
contained more than $160,000 _ even though he earned only $35,000 a
year. It also said that Paul had lethal levels of carbon monoxide
in his blood, raising the possibilities that a) he was poisoned, or
b) his blood sample was nefariously switched after his death.
</P>
<P>
   James Hewitt, the cavalry officer who was Diana's lover, came on
to say that people he believed were connected to either the royal
family or the secret service contacted him during their romance to
warn him off, saying he would end up like a former bodyguard and
confidant of the princess who died in a suspicious motorcycle
accident in 1988. The mysterious callers made it clear, Hewitt
said, that ``it was not conducive to my health to continue the
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Fayed, who owns Harrod's but has little
credibility in Britain, possibly because he argues that the
accident was a plot to prevent Diana from marrying a Muslim. Fayed
has denied that Paul, one of his employees, was drunk, although his
blood alcohol levels far exceeded the legal limit for driving.
Fayed has announced that he is ``99 percent certain'' it was not an
accident at all.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary was greeted here with derision and incredulity.
``I think I'm living in a lunatic asylum,'' said Sir Bernard
Ingham, former spokesman for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
during an ITV debate about the documentary.
</P>
<P>
   The controller of news and current affairs at ITV, Steven
Anderson, brushed aside the criticism. ``If people are truly
satisfied that this was a simple accident, why did 12 million
people watch it?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theories represent a sort of meeting of two needs,'' said
Henry Porter, the London editor of Vanity Fair magazine. ``The
first is the need to provide a spectacular and sensational
martyrdom to match Diana's life. The other is the need, in the case
of Mohamed Fayed, to remove the blame from the Ritz and himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two needs coalesce in a very useful sort of
collaboration. People just can't believe that she died in a
drunk-driving accident. It's too banal, it's too awful and in some
ways it's just not believable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Mirror, which has mostly supported Fayed, asked its
readers to call in to express their opinions. Of the 9,877 callers,
94 percent said they believed the chauffeur was ``paid by the
secret services.'' The crash was not ``just an accident,'' 95
percent said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, the theories are wilder, mushing together
fantasies about a money and drug cartel controlled by the FBI, the
CIA, the Queen of England, the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds

   WASHINGTON _ This is no ordinary circus.
</P>
<P>
   The horde accompanying President Clinton to China this week will
number more than 1,000 people and includes a blue goose, a
presidential seal, and a pair of road runners.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential entourage and its paraphernalia fill four
passenger planes and several large C-141 military transports. The
White House is taking 60 tons of communications gear, as many as 10
armored limousines and enough bottled water so that the president
and first lady won't have to open a tap to bathe in the luxurious
Chinese guest houses and five-star hotels where they will be
staying on their nine-day trip.
</P>
<P>
   The swarm includes six members of Congress, five Cabinet
officers with their own retinues, a chief of staff and a deputy
chief of staff, a national security adviser and a deputy national
security adviser, a press secretary and a deputy press secretary.
Five stenographers. Two two-member White House television crews. A
valet for the president and a hairdresser for Mrs. Clinton. The
president's private secretary and the White House staff secretary.
Speech writers and rewriters; doctors and lawyers, 375 reporters
and photographers. Snipers, commandos and bomb-sniffing dogs. And
countless lords aleapin'.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving the White House to China,'' one senior White
House advance agent said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rumors that he is bringing all his own furniture from the
United States aren't true at all,'' said Zhang Tianping, the public
relations manager at the Diaoyutai State Guest House, where the
Clintons will stay in Beijing, according to Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton is bringing his bulletproof lectern, known as the
blue goose, and the closely guarded carved presidential seal that
adorns it. The White House is flying in at least two road runners,
the sinister-looking black secure communications vans that
accompany a presidential motorcade. And, as always, Clinton will be
tailed by Kris Engskov, his personal aide and briefcase carrier.
</P>
<P>
   All this for a summit meeting in Beijing and postcard visits to
four other cities that even the White House says are expected to
yield few concrete results.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials and U.S. diplomats in China are appalled and
amused. One bewildered senior American in Beijing told a visitor
that he was told to expect 1,200 people when Clinton arrives next
Thursday. That may not be far off. White House advance people have
rented 350 cars in Shanghai alone.
</P>
<P>
   Even in comparison with China trips by previous presidents, the
size of the royal court is astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   When Richard M. Nixon made his historic journey to Beijing in
February 1972, he was accompanied by 300 people. The official party
numbered 34, and only 87 members of the press were allowed to cover
the visit. The White House and the American media wanted to send at
least twice as many people, while the Chinese demanded a much
smaller number. Weeks of bargaining resulted in 300 eventually
making the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``By today's standards, it was a modest group, but the Chinese
were shocked by the huge horde of people coming, both White House
staff and the numbers of press we requested,'' said Winston Lord,
an aide at the time to Henry Kissinger and later ambassador to
China.
</P>
<P>
   The shock to the Chinese had worn off a bit when Gerald R. Ford
visited Beijing in December 1975. Records from the Ford library
indicate that the contingent had grown to about 450 people,
including 170 American journalists. The trip was less newsworthy
than Nixon's, but in those years, for most American news
organizations, it was a rare opportunity to get into China at all.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of Ronald Reagan's visit to Beijing, Xian and
Shanghai in April 1984, the traveling party had grown to nearly 600
people, including a huge increase in the Hollywood stage managers
brought into the White House to assure photogenic coverage of the
Gipper. The press corps had grown to 260.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush's 40-hour visit to Beijing in February 1989 was an
anomaly, a hastily arranged trip essentially tacked onto his
journey to Japan for the funeral of Emperor Hirohito. Records from
the Bush library indicate the traveling party was about 100 people
smaller than Reagan's entourage.
</P>
<P>
   John Podesta, the White House deputy chief of staff coordinating
the Clinton visit, said he has had to say no to scores of officials
who wanted to make the passage, and that a decision was made early
on not to invite business executives. Clinton is under fire for
accepting campaign contributions funneled through a Chinese
military official and for approving the sale of a satellite by a
company under investigation for leaking sensitive technology to
Beijing. Thus it was an easy call to keep CEOs off Air Force One.
But even without a large contingent of special pleaders, the list
of travelers just kept growing, Podesta said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will fly in with the
president. Also going are Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, U.S.
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, Commerce Secretary
William Daley and Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   Counting deputies, aides and support people, the official party
numbers 100, Podesta said, and ``another 500-600 will float in and
out around this trip.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had a trip quite this large,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said it could not provide an exact count because
many officials and support people are traveling separately and
meeting the president in China.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials also say it is impossible to calculate in
advance the overall cost of the trip because the expenses are paid
by numerous government agencies and because many of the the bills
arrive for months after the trip has ended. But for a sense of
scale, news organizations have been advised that each accredited
reporter can expect to pay $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service, citing security reasons, will provide no
figures on the numbers of agents assigned to the trip. But their
numbers include not only the plainclothes agents who stay close to
the president, but also sharpshooters and counter-assault squads,
officers to secure public sites and operate metal detectors and
technicians to run a secure communications network.
</P>
<P>
   But why so many others? The usual Clinton trip, after all,
involves a retinue of 500 or 600.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Mike McCurry said the size of this
court reflects the importance of the relationship with China, as
well as a desire by senior government officers to be present at a
historic event. He attributed the growth in the size of the press
contingent to the demands of 24-hour-a-day news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   He also explained why no one will provide firm figures on the
size of the entourage. ``It's hard to get people to talk about any
of this stuff because it always seems so extravagant,'' McCurry
said, ``especially when you see other leaders with one or two cars
in their motorcades. On the other hand, they're not leading the
United States of America.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ After relatively rich South Africa,
which African country has the highest percentage of cellular phones
among telephone users? Ghana? The Ivory Coast? Kenya? Nigeria?
</P>
<P>
   None of the above. The correct answer is the desperately poor,
badly shot-up Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the regular
telephone system _ where it exists at all _ is so decrepit that
cellular is often the only option.
</P>
<P>
   Cheerleading for the dream of an African renaissance is all the
rage these days on the continent, but without better
telecommunications it will be as hard to spread wealth and
democracy as it would have been for Florence and Chartres to spread
Renaissance culture without the old Roman roads.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 1 in 300 people in sub-Saharan Africa has a phone,
making the financial opportunities huge. Most companies marketing
heavily to rural Africa are pushing low-technology goods like beer,
cigarettes, detergent and fertilizer. But impoverished Africans
also need telephones to relay family news and money, just as many
poor New Yorkers do when they patronize storefront phone shops.
</P>
<P>
   For example, failing to come home for a funeral is a grave
social offense in Africa. When a village doesn't have a phone,
someone must go to the city simply to tell others that a villager
has died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Africans spend a huge proportion of their meager incomes going
places they could reach by phone,'' said Piers Letcher, a spokesman
for the International Telecommunication Union, a Geneva-based
United Nations affiliate. ``People who need food will pay for
telecommunications _ they're transferring money from their
transportation budgets.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to common wisdom, rural telephones can make money if
the goal is one phone in every village, not one in each hut. Bakary
Njie, managing director of the national telephone company of tiny
Gambia, took on the risk of laying a 250-mile fiber optic cable
through the hinterland and attached 300 privately owned 24-hour
phone centers. Villagers walked miles to line up outside the
centers, which soon paid for the costly cable installation.
</P>
<P>
   The continent's obstacles are huge, however, and politics is a
bigger one than poverty, malarial jungles or the snows of
Kilimanjaro. Hard as it is to wire the 1 billion people in China,
at least they all live in one country; Africa's 740 million people
live in 55. Those African nations that don't have overwhelming
problems like civil war have simpler ones, like bureaucratic sloth
and dishonesty.
</P>
<P>
   Each country has different telecommunications laws _ or none at
all. And many governments earn a big chunk of their budgets through
their doddering telephone monopolies. The money comes from tourists
and executives in hotels that gouge so deeply that the phone bill
often tops the room bill, and from the fees paid by U.S. and
European carriers for incoming calls connected through the
monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   There are also absurd inefficiencies. For example, in a colonial
legacy, a call from South Africa to next-door Mozambique was until
recently routed through both London and Lisbon. Even when a country
wants to improve its phone service, pythons of red tape can
encircle the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion of complex technology is high. Intercellular Nigeria
president Bashir Ahmad Rufai said he had to approach 20 Nigerian
banks to raise a mere $10 million for his network. ``One banker
asked us to line up a buyer for my telecom equipment if it didn't
work _ as if it were used furniture I could get rid of,'' he said.
Approaching foreign bankers was pointless, he added, because they
are afraid of Nigerian corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, the ultimate in phone technology is set to roll
out: hand-held phones able to call from anywhere on the planet to
anywhere else, thanks to new networks of dozens of low-orbit
satellites. It's expensive but ideal for Africa's vast unwired
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Getting bureaucrats in 55 countries to sign licenses is a
nightmare, though. ``A civil servant's job is fairly tenuous in
Africa,'' said John Richardson, head of Iridium Africa, which has a
satellite network. ``Seeing us means writing a position paper for
the minister, and so on. Why do that if you can get away with doing
nothing?''
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, corruption seems to be abating. Richardson
said he had been steered toward signing on local partners related
to government officials, but had ``never personally bumped into an
overt or covert request for a bribe.''
</P>
<P>
   International Telecommunication Union secretary general Pekka
Tarjanne is an optimist for three reasons: technology is rapidly
becoming cheaper, the fading of socialism means privatization is no
longer a dirty word and minister of telecommunications is now an
important post in many countries. In 36 countries, the post offices
no longer run the national phone systems. In 10, there are
competing cellular phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Even pie-in-the-sky ideas seem not so crazy these days.
Nigerian-American entrepreneur Joseph Okpaku attends conferences
trying to rustle up funding for his dream company, Telecom Africa.
His goals are to reverse the African diaspora, create pan-African
affirmative action and make everyone involved rich. His vision is
to recruit engineers around the world to come back to Africa to
design and produce telecommunications equipment here.
</P>
<P>
   Hopelessly romantic? Maybe not. Iridium is one of six new
satellite companies competing to serve Africa, and one way they can
make friends is to make their equipment here.

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ After relatively rich South Africa,
which African country has the highest percentage of cellular phones
among telephone users? Ghana? The Ivory Coast? Kenya? Nigeria?
</P>
<P>
   None of the above. The correct answer is the desperately poor,
badly shot-up Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the regular
telephone system _ where it exists at all _ is so decrepit that
cellular is often the only option.
</P>
<P>
   Cheerleading for the dream of an African renaissance is all the
rage these days on the continent, but without better
telecommunications it will be as hard to spread wealth and
democracy as it would have been for Florence and Chartres to spread
Renaissance culture without the old Roman roads.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 1 in 300 people in sub-Saharan Africa has a phone,
making the financial opportunities huge. Most companies marketing
heavily to rural Africa are pushing low-technology goods like beer,
cigarettes, detergent and fertilizer. But impoverished Africans
also need telephones to relay family news and money, just as many
poor New Yorkers do when they patronize storefront phone shops.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Midway through a news story about Steven Brill's
arrival as the newest major-domo in the booming industry of media
criticism, Howard Kurtz, a respected practitioner himself for The
Washington Post, suddenly found it necessary to open parentheses
confessionally in noting: ``The founder of Brill's Content (to
which this reporter is to be an occasional contributor) could not
be reached for comment.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a moment of comic relief badly needed by the Fourth
Estate, run ragged these past five months in its coverage of the
allegations of sex and mendacity at the Clinton White House. Here
was the media watchdog watch turning into a shimmering house of
mirrors, with one watchdog sniffing out the latest watchdog while
properly noting the crisscross of commercial interests at work in
all the watching.
</P>
<P>
   In his inaugural edition of Content magazine (``the independent
voice of the information age''), Brill, a masterly self-promoter,
managed to unnerve the media with his own reporting and caustic
criticism of the print and television performance thus far on the
still murky story of President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, the
former White House intern now flirting with indictment.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a mad competitive tumble of rumor and scoop, leak
and spin that, apart from any search for truth, has been selling
newspapers sensationally and plunging television news into
round-the-clock frenzies of redundancy.
</P>
<P>
   For his debut, Brill succeeded in getting an exclusive interview
with Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel in charge of the
Lewinsky investigation whose style seems part Garbo, part Javert.
Brill fashioned not so much a bombshell as an enormous cream pie
smeared in the face of the Washington press corps. ``Corrupted to
its core,'' he charged in depicting the media as enablers of a
freewheeling prosecutor and ``headlining whatever he leaks out _
instead of remaining professionally suspicious of him and his
power.''
</P>
<P>
   In his indictment, Brill dared to denounce a few reporters by
name as ``lapdogs'' and ``stenographers'' fawning for biased scoops
engineered by Starr's office. Brill's timing was fortuitous, for,
as so often happens, there was no real news this week in the
Lewinsky story. The traditional fallback in this situation is for
the media to fill space by writing a story about the sort of job it
has been doing on the big story. But Brill arrived with rabid
keenness, his teeth bared for his own kind, nipping at a pack that
instantly turned yowlingly back at him.
</P>
<P>
   Treacheries were decried. Lawsuits were threatened by bloodied
reporters. Headlines were tinged with shock, shock! as Starr openly
confirmed that, for all the anti-leak strictures, he most certainly
did dispatch agents to operate amid the jostling, murmuring crowds
of anonymous sources who work the mean media streets of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Brill soon was vetted by deflated investigative journalists.
Legitimate questions were honed: How could Brill not bother to
tape-record the Starr interview as an event certain to be subjected
to enormous second-guessing and back-biting? How could he not
bother to disclose that he donated $2,000 to Clinton's re-election?
How dare he criticize press methods when, some reporters charged,
their own comments to him in the self-serving world of
``background'' interviewing became warped in translation or even
shifted like chess pieces onto the record as attributed quotes?
What did he call this stuff? Journalism?
</P>
<P>
   The White House, which was least scathed in the Brill version of
the Clinton/Lewinsky media saga, gloated as the Diogenes Watch
morphed cannibalistically into Les Liaisons Dangereuses. News
addicts not already numbed by the growing specialty of
media-watchdogging-cum-hotdogging could pay the $3.95 and read
Brill's full 25,000-word jeremiad, providing they had the stamina
of a doctoral candidate. This oeuvre was followed by a 19-page
single-spaced rebuttal from the presumably very busy Starr in which
the prosecutor charged that Brill's critique ``borders on the
libelous.''
</P>
<P>
   (Thus far, Brill, as principled as any ink-stained wretch, has
yielded only one apology _ for mistaking the ground rules and some,
uh, content of an interview _ once he had learned that the
complaining reporter had furtively tape-recorded the interview.)
</P>
<P>
   The conduct of Lewinsky and the president, whatever it really
had been at the White House, was turned for one brief welcome
moment into a sidebar. They stood by as mute as those accused of
heresy, alchemy and witchcraft in medieval inquisitions used to
wait on learned debates about holy methods. Anyone singed by the
relentless months of blowtorch coverage had to leer at the sweet
turnabout as media fur smouldered.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, media critics have been finding fault since the
invention of the printing press, and maybe since life itself was
first lifted out of context for retelling at prehistoric campfires.
``Newspapers are unable, seemingly, to discriminate between a
bicycle accident and the collapse of civilization,'' George Bernard
Shaw, one of the best of the critics, decreed a century before
Lewinsky became the apple of the press corps' eye.
</P>
<P>
   Let's stipulate, as the phrase goes among the wads of lawyers
now so richly, so leakily involved in the criminal investigation of
Clinton and Lewinsky, that the true story lies somewhere between a
bike accident and doomsday. The devil is in the details, still to
be unearthed by all manner of reporters as the watchdogs watch.
</P>
<P>
   Who is watching Brill? He anticipated the question, appointing
Bill Kovach, a respected newsman and curator of the Nieman
Foundation for Journalism at Harvard, to be an independent monitor,
and take aim at Content from within.
</P>
<P>
   But Brill's excoriating debut has prodded volunteer watchdogs to
the fore, all the way down the ranks to Matt Drudge, the Walter
Winchell wannabe on the Internet. He is often dismissed as a
grating cybergossip but he still lays proud claim to first sparking
the Lewinsky story's explosion in the nation's media. The
mischievous Drudge knows how to filch reporters' story leads and
how to get under the skin of media elitists who imagine the
business should somehow have firm standards.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking Brill's many television appearances in the requisite
huckstering of this latest media watchdog enterprise, Drudge
offered Brill free advice: ``Feed the hungry machine slowly.''

tradition that had its precursor here at Wimbledon when the
15-year-old Lottie Dodd won the title in 1887, women's tennis has
become the proving ground of a bevy of teen-age celebrities. Each
of them is intent on looking and playing like no one else in the
world, especially their precursors, and each of them is already
famous regardless of whether they have actually won a tournament or
not. Bt Robin Finn.

   SOC-WORLDCUP-U.S. (Lyon) _ It is great that the Clinton
Administration wants to reconcile with Iran, Alexi Lalas said. He
and his American teammates will shake hands with Iran's players
before Sunday's game and exchange jerseys after the game. But this
is the World Cup, and politics must take a backseat to soccer, he
said. Ultimately, it is more urgent to win the game than to win new
friends. ``If we establish good relations with another country,
fine, just give us 3 points,'' Lalas said. By Jere Longman.

<P>
   It happens dozens of times each year during jittery hostage
dramas and routine traffic stops: desperate people lure police
officers into shooting them in a phenomenon known in
law-enforcement circles as suicide by cop.
</P>
<P>
   There are no hard statistics showing the frequency of such
incidents, but experts believe that up to 10 percent of the roughly
600 fatal police shootings that occur in an average year are
provoked by people actively seeking to die.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those killed are like Moshe Pergament, a 19-year-old
college student and problem gambler who was shot by police last
November when he aimed a toy handgun at officers who pulled him
over for driving erratically on New York's Long Island Expressway.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are former inmates who would rather die in a
firefight than return to jail. Others are like Juan Rodriguez, a
46-year-old cancer patient who was shot and wounded in Jersey City,
N.J., in May after pulling a gun on two police officers eating in a
pizza shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you go and point a gun at a policeman?'' asked
Michael Johnston, a Jersey City police officer involved in another
suicide-by-cop incident this year. ``You have to figure they're
going to shoot you.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the point, law-enforcement experts say. Suicide
by cop is usually not a capricious act of mania or rage but rather
a calculated attempt to force police to act as executioners, said
Clinton Van Zandt, a former chief negotiator for the FBI. ``Many
times they are not `ordinary' crimes gone bad,'' he said. ``They
are the carefully planned suicides of people who want to be killed
by the police.''
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials have been aware of suicide-by-cop
cases for years, but researchers are just beginning to make sense
of the baffling mix of despair, self-hatred, violence and rage that
seems to fuel such acts. This research has taken on added
importance recently in light of the rash of school shootings around
the nation in which troubled children have opened fire on their
classmates and teachers _ in part, some experts say, to draw a
lethal response from the police.
</P>
<P>
   The term suicide by cop was coined in 1983 by Karl Harris, a
former California police officer with a Ph.D. in psychology who
worked at a suicide hot line in Los Angeles after leaving the
force. ``As a cop, I knew of a number of cases where it appeared
that people had actually forced police officers to shoot them,''
Harris said. ``In the suicide business I saw all the different ways
people attempted suicide, and it occurred to me that maybe some
people were actually forcing cops to shoot them because they wanted
to die.''
</P>
<P>
   In nearly a third of such cases, the victims actually leave
suicide notes, apologizing to the police for having purposely drawn
their fire, Van Zandt said. Just as often, he added, grand jury
inquests discover that the victims had previously announced to
their friends or loved ones their intention to draw gunfire
intentionally. But in the most confounding cases, researchers must
rely on exhaustive psychological studies to determine suicidal
motives, leaving definitive answers unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The few notable studies, including ones conducted by researchers
at the Harvard Medical School and in British Columbia, indicate
that the typical person who commits suicide by cop is a white man
in his mid-20s with a history of alcohol and drug abuse. Much like
traditional suicide victims, such people suffer from depression and
are haunted by feelings of dependence and hopelessness. Their
actions are often set off by the deterioration of an important
personal relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``A break-up or a divorce with no belief that there can be a
reconciliation is often the significant contributing factor,'' said
Sgt. John Yarbrough, an officer in the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
homicide bureau who analyzed police shootings for a recent study on
suicide by cop. ``They are helpless to change their situation and
they often suffer the frustration of, `I can't get it back, it's
over.'''
</P>
<P>
   If the typical psychological profile of someone who commits
suicide by cop seems nearly identical to that of a regular suicide
victim, researchers are still struggling to determine why police
are chosen as the weapon of choice rather than guns, nooses or
pills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most common theory is that if you're shot by an officer,
you're the victim and the officer is the perpetrator,'' said Dr.
Deirdre Anglin, an associate professor of emergency medicine at the
University of Southern California and co-author of a study on
suicide by cop to be published this summer. ``Suicide is still
socially taboo. This way, you're not actually killing yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anglin said there were other, simpler motives, including
cowardice, religious prohibitions against suicide, concern over
insurance policies and a physical inability to commit the act
oneself.
</P>
<P>
   For Van Zandt, however, the rationale behind suicide by cop is
as simple _ and deadly _ as a loaded gun. ``What it all comes down
to is that people know the police have weapons,'' he said. ``If you
drive your car into a bridge abutment, you may not die. But
provoking a cop _ there's probably good reason to believe that's
going to kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   The effect on police officers in cases of suicide by cop is
often neglected, experts say. ``There are feelings of
powerlessness, feelings of being manipulated,'' said Bill Geller,
author of ``Deadly Force: What We Know'' (Police Executive Research
Forum, 1991). Geller added that most officers involved in
suicide-by-cop incidents _ like most of those who kill in the line
of duty _ retire prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston, the Jersey City police officer who shot a
suicide-by-cop victim in January, said he has managed to remain on
daily patrols only because he now understands that he was provoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this kind of thing happens to you, you're basically the
victim,'' he said. ``The only way to go on is thinking that you did
your best _ that in end, it wasn't your decision. He forced you to
do what you did.''

POLITICS OF TOBACCO: TAXES VS. KIDS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans can usually win when they can position
themselves as the guardians of low taxes and small government.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, Democrats have the advantage when they can
frame an issue as one involving the protection of children.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco bill, the most ambitious measure before Congress
this year, lay across that political fault line. Here is what was
said on the final day of debate in the Senate on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a massive tax on low-income Americans, and it is used
to proliferate the bureaucracy of this government,'' declared one
of the bill's principal Republican opponents, Sen. John Ashcroft of
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota, who represents the Democratic
leadership on tobacco matters, put the question this way: ``Do we
protect our children's lives, or do we protect the profits of the
tobacco industry?''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the bill was shelved when Democrats fell three votes
short of the 60 needed to cut off debate and bring the measure to a
final vote. The Republicans won in part because the tobacco
companies mounted a mammoth advertising campaign, said to have cost
$40 million in the last two months, to persuade the public that the
main issue was a tax increase. This gave the Republicans the air
cover they needed to vote against the legislation, which most of
them wanted to do in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill failed for another reason. Many Democrats allowed
their focus to shift. Punishing the tobacco companies became as
important as protecting children from smoking. That diluted their
strongest position and gave added weight to the Republicans'
anti-tax stance.
</P>
<P>
   To understand this, you have to think back a year ago, when the
major tobacco companies signed a trail-blazing agreement with state
attorneys general and class-action lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, the cigarette makers agreed to pay $368.5
billion over 25 years to finance health research and anti-smoking
programs. They also agreed to restrain advertising and pay annual
penalties if the rate of teen-age smoking did not fall to specified
levels. In exchange, lawsuits by the states would have been
dropped, class-action suits on behalf of people with
smoking-related illnesses would have been prohibited and no
punitive damages would have been allowed in suits filed by
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement required congressional approval. In April, the
Senate Commerce Committee voted to drive up the price of cigarettes
by $1.10 a pack, raising the 25-year cost to over $500 billion. The
companies walked out. They said the cost was too high and began
their campaign to defeat the legislation on the ground that it
would amount to a monstrous tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the high price really was the reason for the tobacco
executives' change of heart. But many people who know the industry
well believe that the main reason they switched and began to fight
was that it became apparent that Congress would not give them the
protections they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The companies could have afforded the added money, said Mary
Aronson, who advises institutional investors on legal trends and
who has followed the tobacco industry closely for years. ``What
they want more than anything else is peace in the courtroom,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   A lobbyist who works full time for anti-smoking legislation said
it was reasonable to argue, as the leading public health
authorities did, that the tobacco companies had acted so
reprehensibly over so many years that they did not deserve legal
protection. What cannot be argued, continued the lobbyist, who
insisted that his name not be used lest his words be used against
him in future negotiations, is that stripping away protection has
anything to do with stopping teen-agers from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad took issue with the notion that it would have been better
politics to give the tobacco companies immunity from most lawsuits
so that a strong measure could have been passed to reduce teen-age
smoking. ``Where we made our mistake is in not countering their tax
argument forcefully enough and not talking about the taxes imposed
on all Americans because of this industry,'' he said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic pollster Mark Mellman said ``shifting the focus''
did create a problem. ``Democrats know we're on weak ground when it
comes to taxes,'' he said. ``But Democrats win hands down on
children's issues and health and safety issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that point has not been lost on President Clinton,
who based his 1996 re-election campaign on such issues as mandatory
leave for new parents, protection of children from sex and violence
on television and the Internet, uniforms for schoolchildren,
guaranteed health insurance for all children and more money for
education and child care.
</P>
<P>
   When the tobacco bill came up, the president said that he was
not enthusiastic about giving legal protection to the cigarette
companies but that it should not be a ``deal breaker'' if immunity
from lawsuits was necessary to get a bill that would discourage
teen-agers from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have tried with less success to have children's
issues of their own. ``Both parties have their bread-and-butter
issues,'' said Keith Appell, a Republican political consultant.
``For Democrats, it may be children. Taxes are the bread-and-butter
issue of Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Mellman said that based on his polling and focus groups, he had
no doubt that the issue of children smoking would help Democrats in
the congressional elections this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Appell and his partner, Greg Mueller, disagree. They sent a
memorandum to clients last week about how in blocking the tobacco
legislation, Republicans had stopped a tax increase. The
consultants concluded: ``This sounds like a pretty darn good
30-second spot to us.''

   WASHINGTON _ Is China friend or foe? And should it or should it
not benefit from U.S. technology? The United States is pulled both
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Few embody the tug of war better than Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a
conservative Republican from a southern California district with
lots of high-technology industry. Lately, in criticizing transfers
to China approved by the Clinton administration, he seems caught in
the contradictions of U.S. policy. Look at what he said four years
ago, and what he is saying now.
</P>
<P>
   _ By ERIC SCHMITT
</P>
<P>
   At a September 1994 House hearing on space, Rohrabacher favored
looser restrictions:
</P>
<P>
   ``If the No. 1 threat to the United States today seems to me not
coming from a military threat but instead an economic threat to our
well-being, don't these restrictions that we are talking about . .
. put us at a disadvantage in terms of this major threat to our
well-being in terms of the international economic competition in
the area of high technology?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you could tell me specifically what specific damage to our
national security would be caused if we would just transfer all
communications satellites from the munitions list to a commercial
dual-use list. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I would hope that our industrial leaders who are making these
decisions do not fall back to the position that they just want to
protect the use of old technologies from the new competitive
threats that are coming from China and the former Soviet Union. . .
.
</P>
<P>
   We are very concerned that in this new era that we are entering,
post Cold War era, era of global competition, we can't have our top
businessmen hampered by bureaucratic roadblocks.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was all for tightening them last month as he joined in a
House vote to ban the export of U.S. satellites that would be
launched on Chinese rockets:
</P>
<P>
   ``How is it that the Communist Chinese have improved their
missile capability? You better sit down, Mr. and Mrs. America,
because it appears that several large American high-tech
corporations, in collusion with the Clinton Administration,
provided technology to the Communist Chinese that perfected their
nuclear weapons delivery systems. . . .
</P>
<P>
   It takes the wind right out of your lungs, does it not, just to
think about it? If this is true, it is the worst technological
betrayal of the American people since the Rosenbergs. This is
nothing less than a catastrophe for the security of our nation and
the safety of our people. . . . ''

   Golf is big. Really big. Huge. How big? Golf is 24-hour
cable-TV-channel big, that's how big.
</P>
<P>
   To put the very existence of the three-year-old Golf Channel
into perspective, consider that there is no Football Channel, no
Basketball Channel, no Baseball Channel. Nor, in the department of
numbing pursuits, is there a Watching Paint Dry Channel, a Navel
Lint Channel or a Middle East Peace Process Channel.
</P>
<P>
   True, there is C-SPAN, but the point is that the Golf Channel
says something uniquely profound about our culture. Just what is
anybody's guess, but this much is clear: It has to do with loud
slacks.
</P>
<P>
   And money. The Orlando-based network says it expects to defy its
early skeptics and make a profit for the first time this year,
thanks to an upscale, mostly male audience drawn from the more than
17 million households worldwide that it says now get the Golf
Channel via their cable systems or satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Here, on the occasion of the U.S. Open, the first day of summer
AND Father's Day, are gleanings from a single day's programming.
</P>
<P>
   _ By TOM KUNTZ
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Sunday, May 19, 7:08 a.m. An infomercial
extols a golf club with ``a whole new way of addressing the ball.''
That phrase conjures up Ralph Kramden tutoring Ed Norton in golf on
``The Honeymooners,'' with Norton saying, ``Helloooo, ball!'' This
pitch, however, is for the Wonderputter, the ``Wonder from Down
Under,'' a device whereby you putt not sideways to the hole but
facing it, stroking with an underhand, pushing motion. The ad
features Australians who sound like Crocodile Dundee:(END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Steve Word, host: So tell me, guys, how did you develop the
Wonderputter, the putter from Down Under?
</P>
<P>
   Terry Adcock, Australian pro: Well, it happened quite
innocently, actually, Steve. Paul comes to me for regular lessons,
and the last lesson was on putting. And I showed him the regular
putting method and he said, ``Do people actually putt this way?''
And I said, ``Yeah, sure.'' He said, ``Well, it feels very
uncomfortable.'' And I said: ``Well, if you can come up with
another way, you do that. And if you do, give me a call.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Cleeve, inventor: And I did. I came up with the
Wonderputter!
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)7:38 a.m. An update from ``Golf Central,''
which tries not to miss many golf news tidbits. It seems a caddy
was mugged:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Kris Tschetter played Saturday (at the McDonald's-LPGA
tournament in Delaware) without her normal caddy . . . who's in a
Wilmington hospital recovering from a Friday night attack in
downtown Wilmington. He was stopped for directions, but several
youths beat him up. He suffered several cracked teeth, a broken arm
and a separated shoulder. He was also robbed of $160. . . . Up next
on Central, more than a couple of good shots for Fred (Couples) at
the Nelson. Oh, was he hot!
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)7:39 a.m. A toothpaste commercial just for
golfers:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Like this golf ball, your teeth are filled with microscopic
crevices. Arm &AMP; Hammer gets in these crevices to clean plaque away
better.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)11:30 a.m. Coverage of the Benson &AMP; Hedges
International Open in Thames, England, provided by the BBC. The
British commentators make clear that while golf is not a physical
contact sport, you sometimes have to play with pain:(END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Commentator No. 1: Lee Westwood had an eye infection and thought
of pulling out in the third round, but decided to play, and (scores
of) 77, 76 are not really indicative of Lee Westwood's golfing
game.
</P>
<P>
   Commentator No. 2: I think he got a fly in his eye and,
endeavoring to get it out with a towel, (he) had a dirty towel and
got some mud or something in his eye, just slightly scratched the
retina a little bit or something like that. Anyway it was all
inflamed. It looked rather nasty.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)11:38 a.m. Speaking in hushed tones, the BBC
commentators discern subtle signs of golf athleticism as Retief
Goosen, a South African, approaches a putt:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Commentator No. 1: He seems to be taking it a lot easier on the
golf course today. You know, he's inclined sometimes to walk quite
quickly and get quite excited, but that was a very leisurely walk
across the green, now, wasn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Commentator No. 2: (In sage agreement) Gaining in confidence,
inner confidence. . . .
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)12:40 p.m. Just what golf needs: more
unusual hatwear. Another commercial featuring Australians pitches
Crocodile Dundee-type hats:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Now available from the Outback, an innovative all-weather sports
cap. Made from unique, sun-protective fabric, Outback Shade sports
caps provide an alternative to conventional headwear. . . . Even a
loaded golf bag won't damage these cappies!
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)1 p.m. ``Golf Channel Classics,'' featuring
1964 World Match play in England. Tony Lema, the 1964 British Open
champ, explains to an interviewer that his strategy on the course
will be to play golf:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer: What would you say would be the premium here in
your game?
</P>
<P>
   Lema: Well, always to win you have to be putting pretty good.
But I would say that the premium here at Wentworth would be on
positioning the ball off the tee and onto the green. Very careful
driving and very careful positioning of the ball at all times.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)5 p.m. On ``Golf Talk Live,'' Peter Kessler,
the host, poses a real toughie to Arnold Palmer, a Golf Channel
co-founder and his boss. Kessler is curious to know whether the
golf legend and multimillionaire ever regrets leaving his job as a
paint salesman:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Kessler: Do you regret that you left the world of paint poorer
for your decision to go pro (in 1954)?
</P>
<P>
   Palmer: Oh, no. (Chuckling.) I could never say that I regret it.
I certainly took a long look at it. . . . It was a turning point,
Peter, and it was a good decision as far as I'm concerned.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) 6:45 p.m. Inclusion and diversity a la
Tiger Woods is a big theme as the Golf Channel goes on location for
the grand opening of the sprawling new World Golf Village and the
World Golf Hall of Fame in St. Augustine, Fla. A rock video
features kids with golf irons playing air guitar:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   I love to play
</P>
<P>
   WE LOVE IT!

   I love to play . . .

</P>
<P>
   EXCLUSIVE-SAUDI-BOMB (Washington) _ Update on the government's
investigation of a 1996 terrorist bombing that killed 19 American
airmen in Saudi Arabia. By Philip Shenon and David Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-NUCLEAR (Jerusalem) _ The nuclear tests by India and
Pakistan have left Israel alone in the world as a country that is
widely believed to have nuclear weapons but that has not
acknowledged it does. For now, Israel is apparently happy to leave
it that way. By Serge Schmemann.
</P>
<P>
   POPE-AUSTRIA (Vienna) _ Speaking to a group of Austrian
officials and dignitaries that included former President Kurt
Waldheim, Pope John Paul II said Saturday that European Christians
had a moral obligation to fully reconcile with the Jews. By
Alessandra Stannley.
</P>
<P>
   SWISS-NAZI-GOLD (Washington) _ The ongoing controversy over
Switzerland's role in aiding Nazi Germany have now prompted the
State Department to broaden the debate by raising questions about
the role that other neutral countries played in aiding the Third
Reich.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-TRADE (Beijing) _ The prospects for China's entry into the
World Trade Organization any time soon are nil, the top American
trade negotiator said here Saturday evening after two days of talks
with Chinese officials, casting ice water on any lingering hopes
that a trade breakthrough might be announced during President
Clinton's state visit next week. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-OPERA (Shanghai) _ Rebuffing international pressure to
compromise, local authorities instead chose Saturday to escalate
their dispute with the director of a classic Chinese opera that is
scheduled to open in New York City as the centerpiece of next
month's Lincoln Center Festival. By Seth Faison.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-ECON (Tokyo) _ The Japanese government pledged before a
meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations that it would
revive its economy and repair its banking system, but it fell short
of saying anything new or specific. By Sheryl WuDunn.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-MARK (Frankfurt) _ The 50th anniversary of the German
mark. By Edmund Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   COLOMBIA-ELECTION (Bogota) _ Curtain-raiser for presidential
election runoff on Sunday. By Diana-Jean Schemo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Coded 'a')
</P>
<P>
   FINANCIAL-AID-EDUC (Undated) _ The financial aid season just
ended was the most competitive in memory. Several trends converged,
creating what some experts lament as a near free-for-all in a field
that was until recently relatively well-ordered. By Ethan Bronner.
</P>
<P>
   VOICE-TECH (Undated) _ Later this year, many callers wanting
flight information from United Airlines will speak not to a person
but to a computer that acts like one. It will ask when and where
the caller wants to travel, look up flight schedules and converse
using synthesized speech. United's system is only one example of a
wave of new computer technologies that understand spoken language
and are poised to sweep through the American economy. By John
Markoff.
</P>
<P>
   SUMMER-JOBS (Gaffney, S.C.) _ For the youth of South Carolina,
the benefits of America's lowest unemployment rate in three decades
are unmistakable in South Carolina. Heavy doses of foreign
investment have helped drive the statewide jobless rate down to 2.5
percent this spring from 4.4 percent a year earlier. But the
experience of South Carolina's young job seekers is not replicated
everywhere. By Robert D. Hershey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   BROTHERS-BENNETT (Washington) _ The Bennett who defends the
president has a close and complicated relationship with the Bennett
who thinks the president should be ashamed. Each says he respects
his brother's right to make a living. By Melinda Henneberger.
</P>
<P>
   ELECTION-THEME-EDUC (Albuquerque, N.M.) _ Around the nation,
candidates for state and local office this year are talking far
more about education than any other theme. Nowhere is that better
demonstrated than here in New Mexico's First District, where a race
to fill the seat of Rep. Steve Schiff, a Republican who died in
March, at times more resembles a contest for a seat on the local
school board than for Congress. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   NY-BILINGUAL-EDUC (New York) _ New York City Schools Chancellor
Rudy Crew is preparing to step into a political vortex in the fall
with a plan to overhaul bilingual education in New York City.
Senior school administrators say the effort will improve schooling
for immigrant children in their native languages, not abolish it.
By Randal C. Archibold.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCT-FLAWS (Washington) _ A bill to set nationwide standards
for damages from flawed products from toasters to heart valves has
eluded a coalition of Republicans and manufacturers for years. But
a new agreement with the White House may mean its time has come,
perhaps this summer. By Neil Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH-POLICE (Pittsburgh) _ Pittsburgh's police force has
the highest percentage of women of any big-city force in the

   MAYORS-CONFERENCE (Reno, Nev) _ Under mounting pressure from the

lawmakers have reversed their decision to have the Housing
Department's chief investigator examine housing programs in three

   Threats and Defiance In a Balkan Stalemate
</P>
<P>
   NATO began the week with a show of force to warn Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, to stop using his military against
the ethnic Albanian majority in Serbia's restive province of
Kosovo. More than 80 NATO jets ranged through the skies bordering
Serbia to drive home the point that the West was serious about
heading off Kosovo's ethnic bloodshed, which could spread through
the region.
</P>
<P>
   But the effect the message was having was not very clear. For
one thing, America's allies in NATO want United Nations
authorization for any use of force, and Russia threatens to veto
such a step.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic met in Moscow on Tuesday with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin and promised concessions over Kosovo. He did not, however,
agree to a key Western demand: withdrawing Serbian security forces
from the province. And he was defiant, declaring, ``In the latest
actions, it was declared by the security forces there were no
civilian victims at all.''
</P>
<P>
   An Atom's-Eye View of AIDS
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have obtained an atom-level picture, reconstructed by
computer from X-ray data, of the first contact made between an AIDS
virus and the human cell it infects. The picture portrays the
daunting strength of the virus' several defenses against the immune
system. It also defines points of vulnerability against which new
drugs and vaccines might be designed.
</P>
<P>
   The images were a result of an eight-year joint effort by
research teams at Columbia University and the Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute in Boston. They focus on the probe protein that studs the
virus' surface like the spikelets of a mine. The probe protein is
also the basis of an AIDS vaccine about to be tested in the United
States and Thailand.

<P>
   Cashing Out
</P>
<P>
   Gus Levy, a late chairman of Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., once described
the firm's secret of success as ``long-term greedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's top private investment bank subordinated the
individual deal maker to a team-oriented partnership. Delayed
riches came to those who pledged lifetime allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Goldman's 190 partners have decided that their philosophy
has proven so successful, and that the competitive landscape has
changed so much in the late 1990's, that the time has come to cash
out.
</P>
<P>
   They will dissolve their partnership in favor of selling shares
to the public, and reaping the very considerable value, as much as
$30 billion, that the firm expects the public to place on the
Goldman franchise. The question is whether Levy's magic formula
will lose the long-term ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   _ By JOSEPH KAHN
</P>
<P>
   A Signal to Tehran?
</P>
<P>
   Six months after Iranian President Mohammad Khatami extended a
small olive branch to the United States, the Clinton administration
responded with the offer of a ``road map'' to normalized relations
between the two countries. The offer came in a speech by Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright almost two decades after Iran's Islamic
revolution took U.S. diplomats hostage and made a breakup with
Washington inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly why the administration decided to make the gesture now
was not disclosed. But the United States, stunned by nuclear bomb
tests in India and then Pakistan, and losing its foothold on Iraqi
sanctions, may have noticed that it has no leverage in Iran,
another potential nuclear nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranians were neither overjoyed nor grateful. Their
officials responded with the opinion that they would like to see
some deeds to go with the words. In her speech, Albright said
nothing new about U.S. efforts to isolate Iran economically.

   An Au Pair Goes Home
</P>
<P>
   The highest court in Massachusetts freed the au pair Louise
Woodward to return to her native England, and she was off like a
shot the next day, lingering not an extra minute in the country
where her name had become synonymous with the deepest fears of
working parents.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woodward, 20, was convicted last fall of murdering Matthew
Eappen, the 8-month-old baby boy in her care, but Judge Hiller
Zobel then converted the verdict to a manslaughter conviction and
sentenced her to time already served _ 279 days. Tuesday, the
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld that decision, while
emphasizing that Ms. Woodward had not been acquitted.

   A Downsizer Is Downsized
</P>
<P>
   When Albert Dunlap was ousted as Sunbeam Corp.'s chief
executive, the decision drew cheers in the streets from factory
workers at a plant in Cleveland that the company had planned to
close, an executive recruiter said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of Dunlap's former employees and associates
unapologetically celebrated the embarrassingly public way in which
he was thrown into the ranks of the unemployed, when the Sunbeam
board said he hadn't lived up to his reputation as a turnaround
artist. He had also become known as Chain Saw Al for the way he
downsized thousands of workers while earning tens of millions of
dollars for himself.

   Bill Who? Diana Who?
</P>
<P>
   Sports Illustrated on Thursday proclaimed him the ``most
familiar face on the planet earth,'' ahead of Bill Clinton and the
late Princess of Wales. Fortune detailed his impact on the global
economy two weeks ago. Taking all revenue surrounding his image
into account, the magazine came up with $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and Michael Jordan still plays basketball fairly well.
</P>
<P>
   Incomparable icon or merely incredible athlete, Jordan led the
Chicago Bulls to their third straight championship and sixth in the
last eight seasons on Sunday with an astounding finish in the
season's final game.
</P>
<P>
   In 37.1 seconds befitting his legend, the league's greatest
player scored a breathtaking layup, stole the ball from Karl Malone
on the defensive end and finished the Utah Jazz with a pretty jump
shot from 17 feet away with 5.2 seconds remaining. ``I can't see
him topping this, but then again, it is Michael Jordan,'' his
coach, Phil Jackson, said.

   A New Face at the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, architect of the Dayton accords on Bosnia,
has been nominated as the U.S. representative to the United
Nations, replacing Bill Richardson, who will be secretary of
energy.
</P>
<P>
   Given Holbrooke's reputation for independence and media
management, his appointment was big news for those who like to
speculate on the intricacies of power-sharing in the specialized
world of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   There were immediate suggestions that Holbrooke might pull the
spotlight off Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and disrupt a
relatively harmonious foreign-policy team. But the two have vowed
to make their new relationship work, and one official took a
pragmatic view of the appointment's meaning: ``With so many balls
in the air, we needed another pair of competent hands.''

   Judgment in Hollywood
</P>
<P>
   The assignment was daunting: pick the 100 best American movies.
Ever.
</P>
<P>
   With such a wealth of cinematic riches over the century, where
could the American Film Institute turn?
</P>
<P>
   Such a task couldn't possibly be entrusted just to stuffy film
historians and critics.
</P>
<P>
   No, the institute also sought out common folk like, say, Bill
Clinton and Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Top honors, of course, went to ``Citizen Kane.'' Even those
who've never seen the Orson Welles classic are used to it being
called the best, so they might well have voted for it anyway. And,
continuing to round up the usual suspects, No. 2 was perhaps the
most-quoted movie ever, ``Casablanca.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Yankee Doodle Dandy'' an ignominious 100th? And not a
single film from Ernst Lubitsch or Preston Sturges?
</P>
<P>
   A moment of silence, please, or perhaps darkness, for the giants
left on the century's cutting-room floor.

   Poesy at the Bout &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The outlook wasn't prose-y for the literary crowd &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who jammed the hall to hear _ of all things! _ poems read aloud &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By poets using metaphor to knock each other out &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Taos, New Mexico's, world championship poetry bout.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The champ, a native son, Jimmy Santiago Baca, &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Declaimed his work in cadences designed to stir and rock a &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crowd that oohed and aahed at onomatopoeic iambs &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And booed with murderous intent at less-than-perfect rhy-ambs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His foe, Sherman Alexie, pursued the winner's purse &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With lyric tales of Indian life in arch, impassioned verse. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Denying 'twas a contest _ ``It's poetry we love'' _
</P>
<P>
   The poets punched and counterpunched with fist in wordsmith's
glove. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ten rounds of reading left the two men bloodied but unbowed &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And things stood even as they spoke their last before the crowd &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tension rose unbearably _ well, 'twas bearable, perhaps, &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though supporters of each fighter looked as though they might
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The whole idea, of course, was to enlarge the poet's house. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Poetry wins, not poets, was the stated theme in Taos. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And it was true for most on hand, but not in Baca's camp &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For though J.S.B.'s verse lives on, Alexie is the champ.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, June 21, moved Saturday in the `a' category.
</P>
<P>
   This final budget adds: U.S.-CHINA-REVIEW and GOLF-TV-REVIEW.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-ASIA-REVIEW _ No one then could imagine the kind of crisis
Asia faces today: economic meltdown. And if you listen closely to
the oratory of Washington before the most important foreign trip of
Bill Clinton's presidency, to China, things sound very different.
On Tuesday Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin took to the podium of
the White House to declare that ``China has been an island of
stability in Asia'' _ a savvy, responsible player in the global
effort to tamp out the economic firestorm that started in Asia a
year ago. And Japan? The view from Washington these days is that it
is spreading the bubonic plague of the markets _ wild instability _
and yet refuses to clean up its act. By David E. Sanger. WITH
GRAPHIC. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WORKPLACE-REVIEW _ These days, it seems people are trying to be
all they can and must be at the office, as the workplace has become
an increasingly popular but elusive spot to look for meaning and
fulfillment in life. It's fine to take the road less traveled, as
long as it means finding a less-congested route to get to the
office earlier. By Adam Bryant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DIANA-DEATH-REVIEW _ Eight months have passed since the Princess
of Wales died in what the French authorities have called a
straightforward car crash. But their flat assertions that it was
merely an accident have only encouraged theorists, who are still
busily inventing wacky stories. By Sarah Lyall. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-ENTOURAGE-REVIEW _ The horde accompanying President
Clinton to China this week will number more than 1,000 people. The
presidential entourage and its paraphernalia fill four passenger
planes and several large C-141 military transports. But why? By
John Broder. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CASPIAN-OIL-REVIEW _ A rush is on to exploit what could prove to
be the world's richest oil bonanza. The Caspian is a
California-size body of saltwater _ the world's largest landlocked
body of water _ that may sit on as much as 200 billion barrels and
16 percent of the Earth's potential oil reserves. Even at today's
low prices, that could add up to $3 trillion in oil. But it is it a
sea or a lake? The answer will determine what countries can exploit
the reserves. By Elaine Sciolino. WITH GRAPHIC MAP. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-PHONES-REVIEW _ The dream of an African renaissance is
all the rage these days on the continent, but without better
telecommunications it will be as hard to spread wealth and
democracy as it would have been for Florence and Chartres to spread
Renaissance culture without the old Roman roads. Only about 1 in
300 people in sub-Saharan Africa has a phone, making the financial
opportunities huge. By Donald G. McNeil Jr. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MEDIA-WATCHDOG-REVIEW _ Midway through a news story about Steven
Brill's arrival as the newest major-domo in the booming industry of
media criticism, Howard Kurtz, a respected practitioner himself for
The Washington Post, suddenly found it necessary to open
parentheses confessionally in noting: ``The founder of Brill's
Content (to which this reporter is to be an occasional contributor)
could not be reached for comment.'' It was a moment of comic relief
badly needed by the Fourth Estate, run ragged these past five
months in its coverage of the allegations of sex and mendacity at
the Clinton White House. Here was the media watchdog watch turning
into a shimmering house of mirrors, with one watchdog sniffing out
the latest watchdog while properly noting the crisscross of
commercial interests at work in all the watching. By Francis X.
Clines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   COP-SUICIDE-REVIEW _ It happens dozens of times each year during
jittery hostage dramas and routine traffic stops: desperate people
lure police officers into shooting them in a phenomenon that has
come to be known in law-enforcement circles as suicide by cop.
There are no hard statistics showing the frequency of such
incidents, but experts estimate that up to 10 percent of the
roughly 600 fatal police shootings that occur in an average year
are caused by people actively seeking to die. By Alan Feuer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TOBACCO-REVIEW _ Republicans can usually win when they can
position themselves as the guardians of low taxes and small
government. By the same token, Democrats have the advantage when
they can frame an issue as one involving the protection of
children. The tobacco bill, the most ambitious measure before
Congress this year, lay across that political fault line. By David
E. Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-U.S.-REVIEW (Washington) _ Is China friend or foe? And
should it or should it not benefit from U.S. technology? The United
States is pulled both ways. A llok at how Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a
conservative Republican from a southern California district with
lots of high-technology industry, has changed his position.
</P>
<P>
   GOLF-TV-REVIEW (Undated) _ How big is golf? It is 24-hour
cable-TV-channel big. To put the very existence of the Golf Channel
into perspective, consider that there is no Football Channel, no
Basketball Channel, no Baseball Channel. The Golf Channel says
something uniquely profound about our culture. Here, on the
occasion of the U.S. Open, the first day of summer and Father's
Day, are gleanings from a single day's programming.

</P>
<P>
   EXP-EXCLUSIVE-SAUDI-BOMB (Washington) _ Update on the
government's investigation of a 1996 terrorist bombing that killed
19 American airmen in Saudi Arabia. By Philip Shenon and David
Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   EXP-POPE-AUSTRIA (Vienna) _ Speaking to a group of Austrian
officials and dignitaries that included former President Kurt
Waldheim, Pope John Paul II said Saturday that European Christians
had a moral obligation to fully reconcile with the Jews. By
Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   EXP-CHINA-TRADE (Beijing) _ The prospects for China's entry into
the World Trade Organization any time soon are nil, the top
American trade negotiator said here Saturday evening after two days
of talks with Chinese officials, casting ice water on any lingering
hopes that a trade breakthrough might be announced during President
Clinton's state visit next week. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   EXP-JAPAN-ECON (Tokyo) _ The Japanese government pledged before
a meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations that it
would revive its economy and repair its banking system, but it fell
short of saying anything new or specific. By Sheryl WuDunn.
</P>
<P>
   EXP-GERMANY-MARK (Frankfurt) _ The 50th anniversary of the
German mark. By Edmund Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   EXP-FINANCIAL-AID-EDUC (Undated) _ The financial aid season just
ended was the most competitive in memory. Several trends converged,
creating what some experts lament as a near free-for-all in a field
that was until recently relatively well-ordered. By Ethan Bronner.
</P>
<P>
   EXP-VOICE-TECH (Undated) _ Later this year, many callers wanting
flight information from United Airlines will speak not to a person
but to a computer that acts like one. It will ask when and where
the caller wants to travel, look up flight schedules and converse
using synthesized speech. United's system is only one example of a
wave of new computer technologies that understand spoken language
and are poised to sweep through the American economy. By John
Markoff.
</P>
<P>
   EXP-SUMMER-JOBS (Gaffney, S.C.) _ For the youth of South
Carolina, the benefits of America's lowest unemployment rate in
three decades are unmistakable in South Carolina. Heavy doses of
foreign investment have helped drive the statewide jobless rate
down to 2.5 percent this spring from 4.4 percent a year earlier.
But the experience of South Carolina's young job seekers is not
replicated everywhere. By Robert D. Hershey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   EXP-ELECTION-THEME-EDUC (Albuquerque, N.M.) _ Around the nation,
candidates for state and local office this year are talking far
more about education than any other theme. Nowhere is that better
demonstrated than here in New Mexico's First District, where a race
to fill the seat of Rep. Steve Schiff, a Republican who died in
March, at times more resembles a contest for a seat on the local
school board than for Congress. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   EXP-MAYORS-CONFERENCE (Reno, Nev) _ Under mounting pressure from
the Clinton administration and mayors around the country, federal
lawmakers have reversed their decision to have the Housing
Department's chief investigator examine housing programs in three
cities led by black mayors. By Michael Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   EXP-CHINA-ENTOURAGE-REVIEW (Washington) _ The presidential
entourage and its paraphernalia fill four passenger planes and
several large C-141 military transports. The White House is taking
60 tons of communications gear and as many as 10 armored
limousines. By John N. Broder.
</P>
<P>
   EXP-AFRICA-PHONES-REVIEW (Johannesburg) _ After relatively rich
South Africa, which African country has the highest percentage of
cellular phones among telephone users? Ghana? The Ivory Coast?
Kenya? Nigeria? None of the above. The correct answer is the
desperately poor, badly shot-up Democratic Republic of the Congo,
where the regular telephone system _ where it exists at all _ is so
decrepit that cellular is often the only option. By Donald G.
McNeil Jr.
</P>
<P>
   EXP-COP-SUICIDE-REVIEW (Undated) _ It happens dozens of times
each year during jittery hostage dramas and routine traffic stops:
desperate people lure police officers into shooting them in a
phenomenon known in law-enforcement circles as suicide by cop.
There are no hard statistics showing the frequency of such
incidents, but experts believe that up to 10 percent of the roughly
600 fatal police shootings that occur in an average year are
provoked by people actively seeking to die. By Alan Feuer.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAFFNEY, S.C. _ Unaware of just how much muscle she had, Sharai
Correll took a job as a waitress recently at the local Cracker
Barrel restaurant, the kind of steady, air-conditioned summer work
that generations of teen-agers with limited options would have far
preferred to, say, scrounging for lawns to cut.
</P>
<P>
   But one day of orientation was enough for Ms. Correll, an
18-year old premed student. She quit abruptly and took a job as a
sales clerk at Fila, a shoe and sportswear retailer that is one of
the employers at the 68-store Carolina Factory Shops complex in
this town of 25,875 competing almost desperately for summer help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working here is a lot easier than working at Cracker Barrel,''
said Ms. Correll, who also briefly entertained offers from the
Dress Barn and the Gap and was ambitious enough to take a second
job working mostly weekends at the Upstate Carolina Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five jobs in two days!'' she exclaimed, still amazed at the
leverage she and friends command this year in the market for summer
work, where many students have long had to settle for unappealing
or low-paying jobs _ if they got on any payroll at all. For anyone
with even an ounce of gumption, Ms. Correll said, ``I can't believe
you can't find a job.''
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of America's lowest unemployment rate in three
decades are unmistakable in South Carolina. Heavy doses of foreign
investment have helped drive the statewide jobless rate down to 2.5
percent this spring from 4.4 percent a year earlier, according to
figures from the U.S. Department of Labor.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of South Carolina's young job seekers is not
replicated everywhere. In New York City, for example, finding a
summer job remains a challenge. Yet, even in the city, economists
say a decline in unemployment should open up more jobs for young
people.
</P>
<P>
   And in many places around the country, tight job markets mean
youth unemployment is at its lowest point in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Here, summer work is likely to come at pay well above the $5.15
minimum wage. Young workers typically enjoy hefty discounts on
purchases, often can demand enough flexibility to allow the
occasional long weekend at the beach and may even collect a bonus
of $200 or more for lasting the whole summer.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a recent swing through the northwestern and central
parts of the state found a litany of employer grief about the
inability to attract needed workers, in many cases with adverse
effects on business.
</P>
<P>
   For example, even though vacation season for regular workers is
not yet in full stride, it already takes longer for customers in
Columbia, the state capital, to get through the checkout line at
some supermarkets. The jobless rate has dived to an unheard of 1.4
percent, and even lifeguard jobs, among the most coveted, go
begging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could use about four kids right now,'' said John Ferguson,
the manager of a Piggly Wiggly grocery store in an affluent section
of Columbia. ``My level of service is not what I want it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Another, more far-reaching result of surging demand for summer
workers is that young blacks here are increasingly being drawn into
the labor market.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the unemployment rate for 16- to 19-year-old blacks
remains sky high, at 29.4 percent in May, compared with 14.2
percent for young people of all races. Still, joblessness among
black teen-agers is down _ from 33.9 percent a year ago. And the
shift is a significant development in South Carolina, where the
population is 30.1 percent black, about two and a half times the
national figure.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jamie Devine, 18, who is black, is working this summer as a loan
administrator at Carolina First, a regional bank, doing tasks such
as calculating loan payoffs for people taking out new mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want a job, you can get a job,'' said Devine, who is
putting in a full week for more than $8 an hour after working part
time at the bank during the year while attending Benedict College
in Columbia. ``It teaches you discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Boineau, a vice president who oversees Carolina First's
paid internship program, told of one black teen-ager from the
College of Charleston who was hired as a teller this summer but
quit to take an even better job two days after starting work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so disappointed,'' Ms. Boineau said. ``It gets harder
and harder to get good people.''
</P>
<P>
   Even rural areas of South Carolina, which once offered little
but arduous farm work, provide a choice of appealing jobs this
summer. In Joanna, a speck of a place midway between Greenville and
Columbia, Brooke Bradley, 16, happily tends a video store _ much of
the time watching movies _ for $5.25 an hour after changing her
mind about a job offer from Pizza Hut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just called them back and canceled it,'' she said. ``This is
more steady.''
</P>
<P>
   Some employers have been unable to find extra summer hands at
all, among them the Phoenix, an elegant Greenville inn. ``If six
qualified college kids walked in right now, they'd have a job,''
said Walter Gallman, the banquet manager, citing his need for
waiters, bellmen and front desk people who, he said, could average
$300 a week for 25 or 30 hours of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible. I've never seen a summer like this _ there's
help wanted everywhere,'' said Douglas Woodward, research director
at the University of South Carolina's Darla Moore School of
Business. ``Any 16-year-old who wants a job can find one in this
state right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Acute demand for young workers has not pushed wages up
drastically this summer; employers are still trying to compete on
working conditions and perquisites. But at a job fair in Greenville
sponsored by the Urban League of the Upstate, recruiters for United
Parcel Service said that the $8.50 to $9.50 an hour they could
offer under the company's national pay scales had become relatively
less attractive as competitors' pay creeped higher.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, ``we were leaps and bounds above'' the
competition, said Jim Mahaffey, one of the recruiters. ``There's
not a whole lot we can do except go out and beat the bushes.''
</P>
<P>
   Even students who want jobs but do not want to give up their
summer at the beach are bargaining from a strong position.
</P>
<P>
   The Myrtle Beach Pavilion, a huge resort complex of rides and
attractions, which employs as many as 1,600 people at the season's
peak, still needs to find 300 more workers, said Scott Radwick, who
is in charge of hiring for the resort's owner, Burroughs &AMP; Chapin.
</P>
<P>
   With housing scarce, increases in hourly pay of 10 or 15 cents
this season may not do the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every employer around here is resigned to the fact that it's
going to be a tough hiring season,'' Radwick said.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Later this year, many callers wanting flight information from
United Airlines will speak not to a person but to a computer that
acts like one. It will ask when and where the caller wants to
travel, look up flight schedules and converse using synthesized
speech.
</P>
<P>
   A caller can say, ``I want to fly from New York to San Jose next
Wednesday morning.'' The system recognizes the names of 1,200
airports around the world and understands concepts like ``next
Wednesday.'' Employing advanced forms of artificial intelligence,
it interacts with a caller just as an agent might, even checking to
confirm that it has heard correctly _ ``Did you say Austin or
Boston?''
</P>
<P>
   United's system is only one example of a wave of new computer
technologies that understand spoken language and are poised to
sweep through the American economy. In areas as diverse as airline
reservations, retailing, directory assistance, banking, medical
transcription, computer help desks and secretarial services,
machines that can recognize thousands of words and phrases _ and in
accents as diverse as Brooklyn and Pakistani _ are rapidly becoming
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speech recognition has passed a threshold,'' said Raymond
Kurtzweil, a leading researcher in the field of artificial
intelligence. In the next few years, he predicted, ``The bulk of
business transactions will take place between a person and an
automated personality.''
</P>
<P>
   There could be problems at first. Some people will have to speak
more slowly or clearly than they normally do. And the computers
still get tripped up by jargon, accents and questions they are not
programmed to answer. For example, an airline reservations system
might find itself stumped by a question about ground
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   But the systems promise customers new ease in performing every
type of transaction. Executives at companies developing the
technology say that speech recognition systems are being eagerly
embraced by consumers who have grown weary of waiting for customer
service representatives and of using a keypad to navigate the
seemingly endless mazes of automated menus.
</P>
<P>
   And the relatively few consumers who have found themselves
talking to a computer are generally positive about the experience.
</P>
<P>
   For users of United Airline's speech recognition system, there
is often a reaction of wonder when they realize that a computer
understands their words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it feels like it's smarter than I am,'' said Tony
Molinaro, a United manager. He began using the company's
reservation system, which is now available only to employees,
several months ago and routinely uses it to book flights.
</P>
<P>
   At first he said his sessions would take slightly longer than
with a human being because the computer would ask him additional
questions about which airport he wanted to travel to in the Los
Angeles area. But he has since become an expert user.
</P>
<P>
   The system has enough sophistication to know about the members
of his family who are eligible to fly. For example, when he refers
to his father, the computer asks, ``Do you mean Ben?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very neat that it understands me,'' Molinaro said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the user's age appear to have any bearing on the ease
of adapting to speech recognition. Arthur Edwards of Fort Myers,
Fla., 82, is a satisfied user of the voice service offered by
Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., the discount stockbroker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to get stock quotes and don't like to have to wait,''
Edwards said. The system almost always recognizes without error the
stocks he mentions, he said, although he did recall that it once
had trouble with some stocks traded on a Hong Kong exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said he was quite comfortable talking to computers.
``I've seen lots of changes in my life,'' he said, ``and these days
I spend my time trying to keep up with the grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the new systems will have a big effect on the
American work force. The number of jobs created or destroyed by
such systems is a matter of much debate. But many labor experts
agree that the new technologies will contribute to the growing
polarization of the job market into high- and low-skilled jobs and
a corresponding disparity in wealth.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, they will create high-paying jobs for computer
programmers and for the many marketing people who sell their work.
But in the process, they will destroy semiskilled jobs in customer
service, and many people now earning moderate incomes will be
forced to move into low-skill jobs at the bottom of the employment
ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the scariest economic problem of our time,'' said
Timothy Bresnahan, an economist at Stanford University who has
studied the effect of new technologies on income distribution.
``The most important technological changes tend to be related to
big changes in the distribution in wages.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, jobs that have been among the fastest growing, like
travel reservations, telephone sales and customer service, are in
danger of being replaced by inexpensive and increasingly flexible
speech recognition systems.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. became the nation's first
retailer to install a computer system that answers all phone calls
at the company's 833 stores, responding to queries and
automatically routing calls to the right department.
</P>
<P>
   Sears executives say that while 3,000 jobs were affected by the
new system, no workers were laid off. Because of the strength of
the economy, the company was able to reassign its telephone
operators to new jobs as sales and stocking clerks, but those jobs
might not be possible in times of slower economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The same bullish economy is also fostering widespread investment
in speech recognition technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Charles Schwab began allowing customers to buy and
sell mutual funds over the phone using software developed by a
Silicon Valley start-up, Nuance Communications. The system
understands the names of more than 1,300 funds and can respond to
requests for price quotes for more than 13,000 stocks.

</P>
<P>
   In March, American Express Co., the nation's largest travel
agency, began testing a service that will allow its corporate
customers to call computers for flight information or to make
airline, hotel and car reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Automation has already had a profound effect on telephone
operators. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number
of jobs for telephone, directory assistance and in-house operators
fell to 164,000 from 400,000 between 1970 and 1996, a decline of
236,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   More than a fifth of those _ 51,000 jobs _ have been lost in the
six years since the first rudimentary speech recognition was
introduced, according to labor economists and AT&AMP;T executives. That
system, which can recognize just five terms _ ``collect,''
``operator,'' ``third party,'' ``credit card'' and ``person to
person'' _ saves ``several hundred million'' dollars a year, most
of it in labor costs, AT&AMP;T says.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1907, when AT&AMP;T and Western Electric Co. combined their
engineering operations and created the Bell Telephone Laboratory,
the growth of the telephone industry has been marked by cycles of
huge expansions in employment followed by periods of automation.
</P>
<P>
   The era of operators who manually connected calls at large plug
boards began to end in 1919, when mechanical switching was
introduced, ushering in the era of dial telephones. The first
automated call processing went into service in Brooklyn in 1938,
but it was not until an entirely electronic switching system was
introduced in 1963 that operators began to disappear entirely from
the process of completing calls.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the creation of ``megacenters'' that handle calls
for large regions has significantly reduced phone company
employment.
</P>
<P>
   Among the workers affected by the concentration of jobs in such
centers was Addie Brinkley, who after 40 years of working as an
operator in eight different cities quit her job in August 1996
after AT&AMP;T closed its call center in Modesto, Calif., and asked her
to move to Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brinkley's job had fallen victim to a new computerized
system that performed many of the functions traditionally handled
by operators. AT&AMP;T executives say they accomplished the cutbacks
with almost no layoffs, but union representatives and operators
like Ms. Brinkley tell a more unsettling story.
</P>
<P>
   Her decision to quit rather than move to a directory assistance
megacenter in Reno, she said, mirrored the experience of thousands
of other phone company workers who have been eased out in the last
six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw thousands of people lose their jobs,'' she said, ``and I
saw the devastated lives.''
</P>
<P>
   While few economists assert that speech recognition will be a
job killer overall, many predict that like other information-based
technologies introduced in the last decade, it will bring profound
changes, positive and negative, for workers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   While today's speech recognition systems are not perfect _
United Airlines officials said their system had a call completion
rate of 98 percent _ they are adequate when used with scripts that
reduce the range of expected human answers. And they will improve
rapidly if the development of current speech recognition technology
is any indicator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a confluence of small things, from better software design
to dramatically cheaper and faster computers,'' said Ronald Croen,
chief executive of Nuance. ``There was no single breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   Speech recognition began in the 1960s when computer scientists
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon
University, Stanford University and other centers began to research
the idea with financing from the Pentagon's Advanced Research
Projects Agency, which created the original Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the optimism of researchers and prototypes built in the
1980s, commercial applications remained elusive. It was not until
the early 1990s that companies ranging from giants like IBM to
start-ups like Dragon Systems began offering the first commercial
systems. These systems, designed for personal computers, initially
recognized only individual words and forced users to speak slowly
and unnaturally.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial turning point came in 1992, when AT&AMP;T introduced
the five-term speech recognition technology into its nationwide
long-distance network.
</P>
<P>
   One indicator of the effect that speech recognition is likely to
have in the workplace emerged soon after the United Parcel Service
lost its battle with the teamsters' union last August. Scrambling
for new ways to save labor costs, UPS quietly deployed a speech
recognition system developed by Nuance that gives package tracking
information in response to a caller's spoken commands. Last
Christmas Eve, the system handled 193,000 calls, double the daily
average for UPS. Company officials declined to say what the system
cost but said it had paid for itself in less than three months.
</P>
<P>
   Rand Wilson, a teamsters spokesman, said that the system had
resulted in ``a tremendous loss of workers,'' adding, ``This has
been a contentious issue.''
</P>
<P>
   For Croen of Nuance, the changes are justified because the jobs
that are being replaced are so tedious. He cites annual employee
turnover rates of more than 60 percent for call centers at which
operators answer repetitive questions.
</P>
<P>
   However unrewarding the work, some labor experts worry about the
number of jobs at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the main sources for new jobs for the middle class over
the past 15 years have been telephone sales and
information-related,'' said Robert Reich, the former secretary of
labor, who is a professor of economic and social policy at Brandeis
University. ``Now all those jobs are on the line.''

 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ William Bennett, the conservative author, was in no
hurry to tell his brother, Robert Bennett, President Clinton's
personal lawyer, about his new book project. The working title is
``The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American
Ideals,'' which the Free Press is rushing into print this fall.
</P>
<P>
   So how did the Bennett who works for that same Bill Clinton
react when he heard about this latest endeavor? The Bennett who
thinks the president should be ashamed said, ``I haven't told
him.''
</P>
<P>
   No? ``He's been away,'' Bill Bennett said recently. Then he
stopped, exhaled, tried again. ``Oh, and he's going to want to take
me aside and be my big brother and say, `Be smart, be decent, be
responsible,' and I'll tell him, `I'll be all those things.' It'll
probably be a big headache for him. Or for his client, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Bennetts finally had that conversation a couple of days
later, it went pretty much as expected. ``He has his own life and
has to do what he thinks is right for him,'' Bob Bennett said,
sounding only slightly pained. ``I did say I hoped he would be fair
to the president. I urged him to do that.'' Will the book undermine
their brotherly bond? ``If he's unfair it might,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Each brother says he respects the other's right to make a
living. For Bill Bennett, a former education secretary in the
Reagan administration, drug czar in the Bush administration and
author of the best-seller ``The Book of Virtues'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, 1993), now ensconced at the conservative advocacy group
Empower America, this means excoriating Clinton on a regular basis.
For Bob Bennett, it means defending him.
</P>
<P>
   The close but awfully complicated relationship between these two
prominent men, brothers who sometimes seem to agree on little more
than the appeal of a good steak, is a matter of intense interest in
Washington, where hard-core conservatives and members of Clinton's
inner circle mostly meet on television.
</P>
<P>
   After Paula Jones' sexual harassment suit against the president
was dismissed this spring, pending an appeal, both brothers said
they were looking forward to a period of more relaxed fraternizing.
But just when their regular lunches at the Palm were threatening to
turn into a volley of old stories about their ``Grandma Szalay,''
the younger Bennett has reinvigorated the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   The book has ``nothing to do with him,'' the author says of the
lawyer, in a clear case of what Clinton might call
compartmentalizing.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of dinner table produced these two outsized, and
outwardly very different, men? ``I don't think they had one,'' in
any ordinary, please-pass-the-peas and how-was-your-day sense, said
Ellen Bennett, Bob's wife. Their mother married several times, Mrs.
Bennett said, and ``it was a pretty dysfunctional family.''
</P>
<P>
   Though on opposite sides of a wide cultural and political
divide, they are ``not dissimilar in any important ways,'' she
said. Essentially, they are two tough guys with a sentimental
streak, a memory for slights and great loyalty to one another. They
stay close, they say, by making only the most glancing references
to the president and avoiding certain topics altogether.
</P>
<P>
   They do dare to criticize one another on occasion. ``I know what
he's thinking,'' said Bill Bennett, 54. ``I'll be sitting there
watching TV and saying, `Don't say it. Don't say it.'''
</P>
<P>
   As his brother, Bob, 58, puts it, ``When you've had that
success, people don't say, `Cool it. You're getting too big for
your britches,' and I'll do that for him. I say, `You're not the
nation's priest, for God's sake.'''
</P>
<P>
   Both Bennetts are passionate about their very different work.
And both are clearly still sweet on their wives. Bill has two sons,
who are 9 and 14, Bob has three grown daughters. Each is close to
his family in ways that dramatically exceed the probabilities for
boys raised by a mother and grandmother who at best count were
married a total of nine times.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bennett brags unself-consciously about his wife, Elayne
Bennett, who runs Best Friends, a program that encourages sexual
abstinence among inner-city girls. And Mrs. Bennett likes telling
about their courtship, laughing about the time he was angry and she
made up with an offering of food _ another passion the brothers
share.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rang the bell with a pot roast,'' she said. ``He came to the
door, still with the storm clouds over his head. Then I just lifted
the lid _ and ahh, it was OK''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen, Bob Bennett's wife of 27 years, a photographer and former
teacher whom he calls ``the finest person I've ever met,'' makes
some pretty extravagant claims: ``He has never not made time for
his family. The children have always felt more important than the
client. He's never worked weekends.'' And she said he possesses
that rare quality so appealing in a husband: ``Everything,'' she
said, ``is negotiable.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in his law office, Bob Bennett is at once
charming and efficient, and suggests that the differences between
the two brothers are mostly occupational. ``I'm an advocate,'' he
said. ``I represent people who are in trouble, and Bill is an
advocate for a position.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Bob Bennett said, he became an advocate because of
his younger brother. After their parents divorced, when Bill was 3
and Bob was 7, a subsequent stepfather who drank and had a temper
forced the older brother into the role of protector. While Bill,
who was shy, withdrew into books, Bob learned to box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a defender always, defending him, defending my
mother,'' Bob Bennett said. ``I'd come home from school and Bill
would give me a list of who picked on him. I was supposed to say,
`Hey, did you do this to my brother?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Bam,'' he said, and demonstrated a right hook. ``It sounds so
stupid now. I'm glad to have turned out as I did and not as a Mafia
hit man.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of old friends from the Flatbush neighborhood of
Brooklyn, where the Bennetts grew up, attending both public and
Roman Catholic schools, say the image of Bob as a brawler is one he
has greatly exaggerated over the years. Despite an unsettled life
at home, both boys excelled under the stern influence of the nuns,
their mother, Nancy Walsh Bennett, and their Hungarian grandmother,
Irene Szalay, a force of nature who offered such words to live by
as, ``A gentleman is a gentleman, even in hell,'' and ``There's
always time to do the right thing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bob was the top debater at Brooklyn Prep, and Bill was known as
something of an intellectual even then, tackling ``The Iliad'' and
``The Odyssey'' as a sixth-grader. Even then, too, friends remember
Bill as a child who was deeply interested in moral issues and such
theological debates as how unfair it would be if pets were not
allowed into heaven, official Catholic teaching notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Then and now, Bob Bennett seemed less interested in these
matters. And politically, he has never been comfortable declaring
himself, though he has represented Democrats and Republicans,
including former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger.
</P>
<P>
   He does suggest that he does not necessarily share the politics
of his best-known client. ``If Clinton were George Bush, I'd be
doing the same thing I am now,'' he said, smiling. ``Obviously, the
issues would be different.''
</P>
<P>
   These days Bob Bennett is working on fending off Ms. Jones'
appeal of her case and fighting efforts by the independent counsel
to get top Clinton aides to testify about the president's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett mentioned that he once represented a bookie, and saw a
certain morality even in him. ``That bookie would not give up the
book. He'd have gone to the gas chamber instead. We all choose how
we're going to be moral.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Bob Bennett says, the chief difference between the
brothers is more philosophical than ideological. ``I see the world
as a very complicated place,'' he said, and rubbed his eyes. ``I
wish the world was more like what my brother wants it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, ``We're breaks for each other,'' Bob Bennett said,
getting a little maudlin. ``As long as the other is alive, we don't
have to worry that our family would ever want for anything if
anything ever happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite enormous material success, he clearly sees their blood
bond as a hedge against hard times. ``We're there for each other on
the important things.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own downtown office, Bill Bennett is initially more
cautious than his brother, and still shows signs of the shy child
he was, mostly avoiding eye contact.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, he said, he has had more reason to worry about his big
brother than vice versa. ``The Clintons bother me and what happens
to people around them worries me,'' Bill Bennett said. ``It's risky
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bennetts' politics seem to have shifted since Bob talked
Bill out of joining the anti-war Students for a Democratic Society
in college. But the cultural differences between the two are
reflected in their families. Ellen, Bob's wife, who was dressed
casually for an interview in her kitchen, said their daughters were
``pretty liberal'' and still trying to convert Uncle Bill.
</P>
<P>
   Elayne, Bill's wife, who has a warm, Southern sensibility and a
more formal bearing, served pear tart and tea and said: ''Our boys
wear a tie to school every day, Catholic school. We're afraid of
popular culture. We restrict television and monitor rock music. I
never saw `Seinfeld,' and I don't want my kids to watch `The
Simpsons.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bennett sees himself as a ``public advocate, a public
philosopher on some of the things out there that I believe matter
in the long run,'' he said, adding, ``I do not see myself as Mr.
Virtue.''
</P>
<P>
   He refers to his role in relation to his brother's: ``As a
parallel to Bob, who likes to defend people in trouble, I like to
defend principles that are in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   He has spent many months saying Clinton should resign if he had
an affair with Ms. Lewinsky. But only a few weeks ago, he said, he
decided to write a book about how the whole mess had lowered
America's moral standards, after reading a newspaper article about
a group of Republicans in Naperville, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were apparently sitting around saying, `What does this
matter to me?' I said, `This is ridiculous!' These are Republicans,
who should know better, taking on this pseudo-intellectual,
European, learned nonsense and it made me mad. There should be
outrage!''
</P>
<P>
   He says he is writing the book to counter the cynicism and moral
slippage that are sure to take root if the defense of Clinton's
reported bad behavior goes unanswered. Both brothers said their
relationship would survive this, too. But there are strains over
the Clintons and other matters. Bill once took offense, for
example, when Bob called him ``Mr. Virtue'' on television.
</P>
<P>
   And close as they are, there have always been topics considered
off-limits. One night years ago, when Bill Bennett was 32 and still
unmarried, the telephone rang, and it was his brother. He remembers
the conversation like this: ``He said, `Is there anything you want
to ask me about sex?' He was worried that he had not done his duty
as an older brother. It was very sweet, very guilty, very Bob. I
told him, `Thanks, I'm fine.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bill Bennett asks an interviewer about his brother, looking
for an answer to what some people consider the ultimate personal
question: ``Does Bob believe in God?'' Well, he is not practicing,
Bill is told, but beyond that, he did not say. Suddenly, Bill
Bennett is beaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' he said, `I'll call and ask him if he has any
questions about God.''

CHINA'S NOT READY TO JOIN TRADE GROUP, U.S. AIDE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China is not ready to make the economic changes
necessary to join the World Trade Organization, the top American
trade negotiator said here Saturday evening after two days of talks
with Chinese officials, casting ice water on any lingering hopes
that a trade breakthrough might be announced during President
Clinton's state visit in the coming week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of talk, but China is not yet ready to walk the
walk,'' said Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative,
saying that China has made too few of the concessions to open its
markets to outsiders that Western countries demand as a condition
of entry into the 132-nation organization that sets the rules for
world trade.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese trade officials were not immediately available for
comment on Ms. Barshefsky's remarks. In the past, China, which has
been trying to enter the organization for 11 years, has been
defensive about the membership issue, describing the opposition to
its entry as unfair and politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the country is in the midst of a politically risky
revamping of state enterprises, which has raised unemployment,
coupled with the fact that it is also facing the Asian financial
crisis, some senior leaders may in private be relieved at the
prospect of putting off WTO membership and its potentially painful
obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese government has not yet decided whether WTO
accession is compatible with its domestic agenda,'' said Ms.
Barshefsky in a meeting with reporters. ``I don't believe the
leaders are confident that it would leave them flexibility in the
way they pursue internal reforms,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   In return for minimizing trade barriers, members of the trade
organization enjoy better access to the markets of other members,
which include all the developed Western nations, Japan and many
developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   Trade negotiations between China and the United States, which
has taken the lead among Western nations in part because its own
trade deficit with China is huge, have been crawling at best for
some time, and diplomats have recently played down expectations for
progress during the coming summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Though membership in the global trade body has been a political
goal of China's leaders, in recent months it has become clear that
enthusiasm for accession has been far from universal. Some
ministries and industries in what remains a largely state-run,
bureaucratic economy have worried about the rapid opening of ailing
domestic industries to foreign competition, and an end to the
monopoly positions of state-run commodity traders as well as banks,
insurance companies and other service sectors.
</P>
<P>
   The major areas of dispute, in addition to high tariffs on many
imported goods, include restrictions on agricultural imports and on
the ability of outside companies to gain a foothold in such service
industries as financial services, accounting, tourism, law and
telecommunications, American officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, there is a ``positive trajectory'' in the talks, Ms.
Barshefsky said, but the progress is ``slow and uneven.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Plainly they have not come to grips fully with the changes
that would be required to join the WTO, Ms. Barshefsky said of
Chinese leadership. ``I also believe they have not come to grips
fully with the fact that WTO is not a political organization, it's
a commercial organization.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   China has publicly insisted it should be admitted to the trade
body under special, more lenient conditions granted to less
developed countries. But Ms. Barshefsky said that this question of
national status had been irrelevant in actual negotiations; rather,
the frequent and protracted talks over the last two years have
focused on what specific commitments China would make to provide
genuine market access.
</P>
<P>
   While China's leaders may be glad to put off potentially
destabilizing changes in trade policy, Ms. Barshefsky warned that
the status quo was not acceptable either. In the current trend, she
said, by the end of this year the United States alone will have a
$60 billion trade deficit with China, while Europe and Japan also
face major deficits. Chinese officials say the figures are
overstated.
</P>
<P>
   In the long term, the opening of markets required by the trade
organization should aid the domestic transition to a more free and
productive economy, Ms. Barshefsky said, noting that Mexico had
used its external opening to great domestic benefit. But the
Chinese leaders are too preoccupied with the costs and dangers of
their domestic reforms to focus on those potential gains, she said.

<P>
   Colleges are spending more on scholarships to attract top
students and, as a result, they have less to spend on many needy
applicants, admissions officers and administrators say.
</P>
<P>
   The once orderly world of financial aid, where colleges avoided
bidding against each other and standards of need were well
established, is unraveling, replaced by a more competitive
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors are at work. First, the best colleges have taken
a more subjective approach to need, adjusting scholarships to match
or exceed offers that students get elsewhere. At the same time,
other colleges are taking need into account where they previously
had not, rejecting some poorer borderline applicants in favor of
better-off ones. And more colleges are dangling scholarships to top
students whether or not their families need the money.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many officials consider this the most competitive
financial aid season ever, particularly among private colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Many administrators say that while the most sought-after
applicants are prospering, many good but not spectacular students
with a need for financial help, including those in minority groups,
are less able to get it. The role that colleges had taken on in the
1960s to make the best education available to all sectors in
society is being compromised.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are experiencing a heaping on of greater privilege to
wealthy and middle-class kids,'' said Morton Schapiro, an economics
professor and dean at the University of Southern California and
coauthor of ``The Student Aid Game'' (Princeton University Press,
1997).
</P>
<P>
   ``Will institutions meet the needs of lower-income students?''
Schapiro asked. ``These days, almost the entire enrollment rate
increase is from the middle income and above. The gap between
whites and non-whites going to college is greater than it was in
1980. The poor are increasingly restricted to community colleges,
even being squeezed out of four-year public institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiating over top students may not seem surprising, but
financial aid at top universities had for decades been based purely
on need as determined by a fairly rigorous formula of income and
assets. Using aid to bid for students was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, aid officers even compared offers to specific
students so that no institution could offer more for more desirable
students. While that practice was ended by the Justice Department
in 1991 on the ground that it violated antitrust laws, the
determination of need is still theoretically based on formulas. But
the truth is more complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've got today, unfortunately, is `Let's make a deal,'
and I'm not sure how healthy it is,'' said Robert Kinnally, dean of
admission and financial aid at Stanford University. ``We really
have to get a handle on this growing bidding phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   The offers received by Joyce Keck of Laredo, Texas, provide an
example. When she received replies to her college applications this
spring, all were positive.
</P>
<P>
   The class valedictorian and a Red Cross board member, Ms. Keck
had SAT scores of 1510 and stellar recommendations. But her
parents, a nurse and a Romance languages professor, have
middle-class incomes and savings, and paying more than $30,000 a
year for a top university did not look easy. Harvard College made
an offer of aid, but Rice University in Houston made a more
generous one.
</P>
<P>
   So Joyce's mother, Patricia Cigarroa Keck, sent a fax to Harvard
explaining the quandary. Four days later she received a reply with
a new aid offer _ increasing her scholarship and decreasing her
loan _ worth thousands of dollars more per year. The deal was
sealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard made it a doable stretch,'' Mrs. Keck said.
</P>
<P>
   Schapiro's data show that the percentage of students entering
college from the bottom fourth of income earners has stayed
stagnant at 26 percent since 1978, but has increased by 11 percent
for middle-income earners, to 50 percent, and by 9 percent for the
top fourth of income earners, to 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the disparity are numerous and not limited to
financial aid practices. Most colleges have continued to increase
their aid budgets for the poor and minority groups. But as college
costs have soared and federal aid to colleges has fallen, the
ability to meet historic aid commitments has declined.
</P>
<P>
   This has not been a problem for the most selective institutions
with the largest endowments. They have fueled the new aid climate
with increased willingness to barter for the top students,
regardless of income.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McPherson, president of Macalester College in St. Paul
and co-author with Schapiro of ``The Student Aid Game,'' says aid
is thought of today in entirely different terms from a generation
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go back 20 years, most folks thought of the student aid
budget as a charity operation run on the side,'' McPherson said.
``Now it is a real strategic component of revenue raising and
enrollment management. There are different prices for different
customers, like how airlines price their seats.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of what led to such intense competition this season were
changes announced first by Princeton, then by Yale, Stanford and
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. All said middle-class
families were squeezed by out-of-date formulas for financial aid
and adjusted their formulas for determining aid, like how much of
one's home equity would count as an asset.
</P>
<P>
   The new formulas made it possible for a student like James Doyle
of Springfield, Pa., to accept an offer from Princeton instead of
nearby Lafayette College. Under the old formula, Princeton would
have been financially out of reach for his father, a retired
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The new formulas created a challenge for Harvard, which made
clear that it was committed to making ``competitively supportive
offers of need-based financial aid.''

 UNDATED: financial aid.''. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And in an explicit offer of negotiation, Harvard added, ``We
expect that some of our admitted students will have particularly
attractive offers from the institutions with new aid programs, and
those students should not assume that we will not respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Keck said it was Harvard's letter that prompted her appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's financial aid office was open 12 hours a day six days
a week in April for families to discuss their packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spoke to an unprecedented number of parents this year,''
said William Fitzsimmons, Harvard's dean of admissions.
``Competition had been getting tougher, and this year's
announcement by other institutions did nothing to abate the
competitiveness. But I think from the student's point of view, it
is a good thing. This is America. This is a market.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, say those educators worried by the trend, the changes
at Harvard and Princeton mean that middle-income families whose
children are the cream of their schools can negotiate better aid
packages at elite colleges. But the tactics are having a cascading
effect. Beyond the top colleges, there is an abandonment of the
principle of so-called ``need-blind'' admission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Need-blind'' means accepting students regardless of their
ability to pay and providing a mix of grants, loans and campus
jobs. Many institutions that a decade ago operated by such rules
say they no longer can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago we stated publicly that while we had been
need-blind in the past, we could no longer afford to do it,'' said
Michael Fraher, financial aid director at Vassar College.
</P>
<P>
   Vassar, like Carleton, Smith, Oberlin and others, have become
somewhat ``need-sensitive'' in their admissions procedures in
recent years. That means that, particularly toward the bottom of
the list of those admitted, such institutions do not promise to
meet 100 percent of applicants' needs.
</P>
<P>
   Students from lower-income groups, including members of
minorities, who are not at the top of their classes, may be
rejected because of their inability to afford the tuition, while
students of similar qualification but higher income will get in.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we look at the bottom 10 to 20 percent of the students,''
Fraher said, ``we have to ask ourselves whether we really want to
commit $18,000 of Vassar scholarship money to a certain student
when we can attract two other, perhaps better students, by granting
each half that amount.''
</P>
<P>
   The other trend that has made it difficult for less-endowed
colleges to maintain need-blind policies is the increased use of
so-called merit aid, meaning the offering of scholarships to top
students whether or not their families need the money. The authors
of ``The Student Aid Game'' say that merit aid grew at a 13 percent
annual rate (after adjusting for inflation) in the 1980s and has
apparently accelerated since. Need-based aid, as a portion of all
aid, fell by one-eighth in the 1980s, although it increased
annually by 10 percent during that period.
</P>
<P>
   Through such aid, second-tier institutions seek to lure students
who might otherwise choose a more expensive or more exclusive
school.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is also visible at some state institutions. This past
season, some state legislatures, including those of Kentucky,
Florida and Louisiana, which control state university budgets,
moved toward merit aid in an effort to keep the most promising
students in their states.
</P>
<P>
   The move toward greater use of merit scholarships, particularly
at a time of record stock portfolios, has some scholars asserting
that colleges are backing away from traditional responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``College endowments are at historically unprecedented heights,
so the number of need-blind institutions should be increasing
rather than decreasing,'' said Jerome Karabel, professor of
sociology at the University of California at Berkeley, who is
studying the question. ``Institutions of higher education need to
ask themselves whether they are moving in the wrong direction.''

GERMANS FACE LOSING A LOVED ONE _ THE MARK _ AT 50 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ For decades, the German mark has been a
bulwark against inflation and a national icon that most Germans
have revered far more than their flag or their national anthem. But
now, as the formidable currency reaches its 50th birthday, more and
more people here are coming to terms with giving it up.
</P>
<P>
   With less than seven months left before Germany and 10 other
countries adopt the euro as a common European currency, public
opinion polls show a big shift in attitude from hostility and
anxiety toward grudging acceptance of the project.
</P>
<P>
   The change should come as a welcome relief for Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, who has been the euro's most powerful champion and who will
face the most difficult election of his career in September.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as six months ago, more than 60 percent of Germans
said they were opposed to the euro and feared it would be a weaker
currency than their beloved mark. But a poll published Friday by
Handelsblatt, Germany's leading business newspaper, showed that
only 42 percent of those surveyed described themselves as opponents
and that the share has declined steadily each month since January.
The number of supporters, meanwhile, has steadily increased, to
about 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll is consistent with others over the last six months
that show a slow but steady warming toward the euro. It also
reinforced what political analysts have long predicted: the euro
will not be a deciding factor for most people when they vote in
September. More than 70 percent of those surveyed in the
Handelsblatt poll said they would not base their votes on it.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kohl has been the euro's most important backer, ordinary
Germans have long been unhappy or at least uneasy about giving up
the mark. Adopted on June 20, 1948, three years after the end of
World War II, the currency brought an abrupt end to hyperinflation
in Germany and helped usher in the nation's postwar ``economic
miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades now, the mark has been one of the world's most
important currencies. Many European countries have locked their
currencies and monetary policies to those of Germany. For practical
purposes, the mark has been a proxy for a European currency in many
international financial transactions.
</P>
<P>
   And it will not actually go out of circulation until after a
three-year transition period. The euro will debut in January, but
only for electronic transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, at anniversary celebrations in Paul's Kirche here in
Frankfurt, a cathedral that was the meeting place for Germany's
first elected representatives in 1848, Kohl and other German
leaders both celebrated and eulogized the mark.
</P>
<P>
   But with the general softening of attitudes about the currency
transition, eulogies seem less necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't care what coins I have in my pocket,'' said
Sabine Mueller, a 33-year-old lecturer at the University of Halle
who was visiting Frankfurt. ``To me, the mark doesn't mean anything
in particular. I didn't even know that it is the 50th birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   As for those who resist the new currency, many tend to be older.
They remember the trauma of rebuilding after World War II, and are
more anxious and skeptical than younger workers.
</P>
<P>
   But Germany's business leaders, particularly at big banks and at
industrial corporations, have been overwhelming supporters. Daniel
Mitental, a 32-year-old accountant in Frankfurt, echoed the
optimistic views of many young white-collar workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a big chance,'' he said, relaxing at an eatery
near the old opera house. ``Many people associate the mark with
stability and German virtues like discipline and hard work. But the
value of the euro will be equally stable. People fear it because
it's unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast Josef Hohmann, a retired banker and committed
euro-skeptic, remembered the dark days before the currency reform
that created the modern mark. Germany's old currency was
essentially worthless, and people acquired most of their
necessities standing in lines with vouchers to buy groceries.
Stores had little on their shelves. Nothing seemed secure.
</P>
<P>
   When the mark was first circulated, under supervision of the
Allied occupying forces, food began reappearing in stores almost
overnight as shopkeepers stopped fearing inflation and hoarding
goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine how surprising it was to suddenly find you
could go to a store and choose from a selection of products,''
Hohmann said. ``People don't understand how it was to rebuild. It's
not just a question of a currency. This is also a question of
freedom and independence.''
</P>
<P>
   In a ceremony Friday in Bonn, German central bank officials gave
the president of the new European Central Bank, which will set
monetary policy for the euro, an 876-page book on the role of the
German bank's tough policies in creating a strong mark and
contributing to Germany's postwar growth. Wim Duisenberg, the
European bank president, said the mark should be a guiding light
for future policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``On its way toward establishing itself as a stable common
currency for Europe,'' he said, ``the euro should follow closely on
the example of the mark.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Halfway around the world, where the Caucasus meets
the Middle East, a rush is on to exploit what could prove to be the
world's richest oil bonanza. The stakes are so high that otherwise
sane people are fighting each other for the chance to risk huge
investments in a part of the world plagued by ethnic rivalries,
civil wars, corrupt bureaucracies, faltering economies and big
egos.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not all. Some of these same people have also become
intently interested in solving a curious question: Is the Caspian
really a sea or just a lake?
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for oil and the breakup of the Soviet Union,
that's the kind of question that might occupy scholars in some
musty corner of some obscure university. But today, people need to
know, and here's why:
</P>
<P>
   The Caspian is a California-size body of salt water _ the
world's largest landlocked body of water _ that may sit on as much
as 200 billion barrels of oil, which would be 16 percent of the
Earth's potential oil reserves. Even at today's low prices, that
could add up to $3 trillion in oil.
</P>
<P>
   If it is a lake, one set of rules about access to the oil would
apply, with the nations that border it controlling the undersea
wealth out to a few miles from their shores; the remainder in the
middle _ like the hole in a donut _ would be treated as an
international seabed. The oil in the middle could be exploited,
sold and transported only if all five countries agreed on how to do
it and on how to divide up the profits.
</P>
<P>
   If it is considered a sea, however, the entire bed would be
sliced into pieces, like a pie.
</P>
<P>
   And since five nations now border the Caspian, and a lot of
undiscovered reserves may lie in the large donut hole, the question
is anything but academic.
</P>
<P>
   The Caspian Sea is what it has been called for a long time, and
under the international Convention on the Law of the Sea, it meets
most of the qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Soviet Union and Iran long ago found it
convenient to treat the Caspian differently. Under their 1921
Treaty of Friendship, they made it a freely navigated lake whose
resources _ caviar-filled sturgeon mostly _ were shared by the two
bordering countries.
</P>
<P>
   That worked well enough in the old days. But following the
breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Caspian suddenly became
the property of the five countries that border it: Russia on the
north, Iran on the south, Kazakhstan and tiny Turkmenistan on the
east and Azerbaijan on the west. What they want to exploit isn't
free-roaming like the fish.
</P>
<P>
   So the question underlying the lake-sea dispute is clear-cut:
Who owns the oil under the sea and who controls the pipeline route
by which it gets to market?
</P>
<P>
   For Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, which have the
biggest known fields under their waters, the Caspian is a sea that
would give them maximum control over their own slices.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Russia and Iran, which have less oil and gas off
their own shores, insisted that concern for the environment
required joint sovereignty over the Caspian and its resources, a
ludicrous position since Russia is by far the Caspian's largest
polluter. Russia also argued that because the economies of the
former Soviet republics were developed with Russian financial
support, it deserved more. Russia must have ``access to the
resources of the Commonwealth of Independent States,'' Yuri
Shafranik, who was then energy minister, said in 1994. ``We, by
virtue of our labor, mind, energy have created all this.''
</P>
<P>
   But last April, Russia began to modify its position after
discovering more oil in its sector. Russian President Boris Yeltsin
of Russia and Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev agreed in
principle _ but failed to sign an agreement _ to divide the seabed
and the oil under it into national sectors.
</P>
<P>
   There was a catch. Yeltsin also said that the waters above the
seabed would remain international. That means that all five
countries would enjoy common use of the sea itself, with freedom of
navigation, fishing rights and environmental protections.
</P>
<P>
   Clever move. Russia, which still can't quite accept the fact
that it has to make concessions to three former Soviet republics,
is opposed to a plan for an undersea pipeline that would bypass
Russia. But oil is no good unless it can be moved to market, so
Russia's compromise would give it veto power over any pipeline plan
on environmental grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Yeltsin signs an agreement with Kazakhstan to divide the
Caspian, as he has said he will do next month, will Russia's
Parliament go along? And even if the Russian view prevails, does
that mean a navigational free-for-all in the Caspian?
</P>
<P>
   ``Freedom of navigation sounds good, but does that mean that any
country can move its navy around at will even if it seems
provocative to its neighbors?'' asked Toby Gati, who was the Russia
adviser on the National Security Council during President Clinton's
first term. ``What happens if one country's platform begins to leak
oil? Can the others say, `Get it out of here?'''
</P>
<P>
   With Russia's new position, Iran becomes the odd man out,
insisting that the Caspian cannot be divided into national sectors
and that the oil belongs to all.
</P>
<P>
   The only way Iran will agree is if the Caspian is sectioned into
``equal shares,'' Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said in
May. That means Iran wants to control 20 percent of the seabed; the
normal division according to international law would give Iran less
than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kharrazi also rejected the Russian idea of dividing the seabed
one way and the waters another. ``If there is going to be a
division accepted by different countries, I'm sure that one legal
regime has to be applied to the seabed as well as the waters of the
Caspian Sea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has also declared that any pipeline built under the Caspian
would be a disaster to sturgeon and migrating birds. But its motive
may be to delay the building of any undersea pipeline, in hopes
that the United States will drop its opposition to a much shorter,
cheaper pipeline that would go across Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, regards the
whole debate as part of a U.S.-inspired plot to impose a military
presence on Iran's northern border _ the Caspian _ just as it did
on Iran's southern border, the Persian Gulf. ``The U.S. oil
companies' presence in the Caspian Sea is aimed at paving the
ground for the U.S. military presence in this sensitive oil-rich
region,'' he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Even the World Bank is confused. Recently, the Bank's
International Finance Corporation indicated that Azerbaijan could
get financing for offshore development without a resolution of the
lake-sea issue, a decision that has set off a legal battle inside
the Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. position is that it will accept any decision that will
avoid a pipeline through Iran.
</P>
<P>
   And as some participants in this debate cite legalities and
environmental concerns, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan are busy
developing their offshore deposits, signing multi-billion-dollar
contracts with international firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the lawyers are dithering, the investors are planting
their flags,'' said S. Frederick Starr, an expert on Central Asia
who writes extensively about the Caspian. ``It's like land-staking
in the American West. You get your wagon out there as soon as
possible.''

   On the other hand, the Soviet Union and Iran long ago found it
convenient to treat the Caspian differently. Under their 1921
Treaty of Friendship, they made it a freely navigated lake whose
resources _ caviar-filled sturgeon mostly _ were shared by the two
bordering countries.
</P>
<P>
   That worked well enough in the old days. But following the
breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Caspian suddenly became
the property of the five countries that border it: Russia on the
north, Iran on the south, Kazakhstan and tiny Turkmenistan on the
east and Azerbaijan on the west. What they want to exploit isn't
free-roaming like the fish.
</P>
<P>
   So the question underlying the lake-sea dispute is clear-cut:
Who owns the oil under the sea and who controls the pipeline route
by which it gets to market?
</P>
<P>
   For Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, which have the
biggest known fields under their waters, the Caspian is a sea that
would give them maximum control over their own slices.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Russia and Iran, which have less oil and gas off
their own shores, insisted that concern for the environment
required joint sovereignty over the Caspian and its resources, a
ludicrous position since Russia is by far the Caspian's largest
polluter. Russia also argued that because the economies of the
former Soviet republics were developed with Russian financial
support, it deserved more. Russia must have ``access to the
resources of the Commonwealth of Independent States,'' Yuri
Shafranik, who was then energy minister, said in 1994. ``We, by
virtue of our labor, mind, energy have created all this.''
</P>
<P>
   But last April, Russia began to modify its position after
discovering more oil in its sector. Russian President Boris Yeltsin
of Russia and Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev agreed in
principle _ but failed to sign an agreement _ to divide the seabed
and the oil under it into national sectors.
</P>
<P>
   There was a catch. Yeltsin also said that the waters above the
seabed would remain international. That means that all five
countries would enjoy common use of the sea itself, with freedom of
navigation, fishing rights and environmental protections.
</P>
<P>
   Clever move. Russia, which still can't quite accept the fact
that it has to make concessions to three former Soviet republics,
is opposed to a plan for an undersea pipeline that would bypass
Russia. But oil is no good unless it can be moved to market, so
Russia's compromise would give it veto power over any pipeline plan
on environmental grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Yeltsin signs an agreement with Kazakhstan to divide the
Caspian, as he has said he will do next month, will Russia's
Parliament go along? And even if the Russian view prevails, does
that mean a navigational free-for-all in the Caspian?
</P>
<P>
   ``Freedom of navigation sounds good, but does that mean that any
country can move its navy around at will even if it seems
provocative to its neighbors?'' asked Toby Gati, who was the Russia
adviser on the National Security Council during President Clinton's
first term. ``What happens if one country's platform begins to leak
oil? Can the others say, `Get it out of here?'''
</P>
<P>
   With Russia's new position, Iran becomes the odd man out,
insisting that the Caspian cannot be divided into national sectors
and that the oil belongs to all.
</P>
<P>
   The only way Iran will agree is if the Caspian is sectioned into
``equal shares,'' Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said in
May. That means Iran wants to control 20 percent of the seabed; the
normal division according to international law would give Iran less
than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kharrazi also rejected the Russian idea of dividing the seabed
one way and the waters another. ``If there is going to be a
division accepted by different countries, I'm sure that one legal
regime has to be applied to the seabed as well as the waters of the
Caspian Sea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has also declared that any pipeline built under the Caspian
would be a disaster to sturgeon and migrating birds. But its motive
may be to delay the building of any undersea pipeline, in hopes
that the United States will drop its opposition to a much shorter,
cheaper pipeline that would go across Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, regards the
whole debate as part of a U.S.-inspired plot to impose a military
presence on Iran's northern border _ the Caspian _ just as it did
on Iran's southern border, the Persian Gulf. ``The U.S. oil
companies' presence in the Caspian Sea is aimed at paving the
ground for the U.S. military presence in this sensitive oil-rich
region,'' he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Even the World Bank is confused. Recently, the Bank's
International Finance Corporation indicated that Azerbaijan could
get financing for offshore development without a resolution of the
lake-sea issue, a decision that has set off a legal battle inside
the Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. position is that it will accept any decision that will
avoid a pipeline through Iran.
</P>
<P>
   And as some participants in this debate cite legalities and
environmental concerns, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan are busy
developing their offshore deposits, signing multi-billion-dollar
contracts with international firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the lawyers are dithering, the investors are planting
their flags,'' said S. Frederick Starr, an expert on Central Asia
who writes extensively about the Caspian. ``It's like land-staking
in the American West. You get your wagon out there as soon as
possible.''

POPE SAYS EUROPEAN CHRISTIANS MUST RECONCILE WITH JEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Speaking to a group of Austrian officials and
dignitaries that included former President Kurt Waldheim, Pope John
Paul II said Saturday that European Christians had a moral
obligation to fully reconcile with the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot forget that the history of Europe is tightly
entwined with the history of the people from whence came our Lord,
Jesus,'' the pope said. ``Unspeakable suffering was inflicted on
the Jewish people in Europe, and we cannot affirm that all the
roots of this injustice have been eradicated. Reconciliation with
the Jews is one of the most fundamental duties of Christians in
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   As he did with all the other guests who filed past him in the
receiving line at the presidential residence in the old Hapsburg
Imperial Palace, the pope shook Waldheim's hand and said a few
words.
</P>
<P>
   Historians and researchers have accused Waldheim, 79, of
complicity in war crimes in the Balkans while he served as an
officer in the German army during World War II. He is not a pariah
in his native country, but his name is on a State Department list
of people who cannot enter the United States because of grave
charges against them. Waldheim has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   This is the pope's third visit to Austria, and it was not his
first encounter with Waldheim, who served one term as U.N.
secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
   During John Paul's last visit, in 1988, he was criticized for
meeting several times with Waldheim, then president, who had been
closely linked to the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Since that visit the pope has reached out to Jewish
organizations. He took a historic step toward reconciliation this
year by apologizing for the Catholic Church's silence during the
Holocaust.

JAPAN PROMISES TO FIX ITS ECONOMY, BUT OFFERS NO SPECIFICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Japanese government pledged before a meeting of the
Group of Seven industrialized nations Saturday that it would revive
its economy and repair its banking system, but it fell short of
saying anything new or specific.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to provide any new commitment to economic
restructuring seemed a step backward from the expectations that had
been raised just a few days earlier. When the United States joined
with Japan on Wednesday to intervene in foreign exchange markets to
prop up the yen, President Clinton and other officials strongly
hinted that Japan was ready to take new steps to bolster its
economy, but Saturday those steps seemed more elusive than ever.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Japanese government insisted that it had made no
promises of further restructuring in exchange for American support
for its currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask if there are secret agreements between the United
States and Japan: There are none,'' Eisuke Sakakibara, deputy
finance minister for international affairs, said at the conclusion
of the G-7 meeting of deputy finance ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets throughout the world surged in the last few
days in part on the expectation that the yen's long slide had ended
and that Japan would undertake new policies to improve its economy.
It is not clear how the markets will react in the coming week to
the lack of any clear new steps to emerge this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. deputy treasury secretary, Lawrence Summers, who is in
Tokyo to attend the meeting and hold talks with officials here,
called his discussions with Japanese officials ``very useful'' and
said that they were aware of the urgency of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is going to be most important going forward is the steps
that Japan takes to take advantage of this window of opportunity,''
said Summers at a news conference Saturday. ``There is a clear
recognition of the need to move rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   But he would not say whether Japan had outlined new economic
measures or how confident he was that it would respond decisively.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting of G-7 officials, expanded to include
representatives of 10 Asian countries, the International Monetary
Fund, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, was intended
to put pressure on Japan to take further steps and to reassure the
financial markets that there was a new determination on Japan's
part to address its problems. But the vagueness of the simple
statement issued by the meeting's participants Saturday suggested
that it would not be easy to keep up the momentum for cooperation
if Japan does not move fast to mend its economy.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement, the United States and other countries agreed
to ``monitor developments'' and cooperate ``as appropriate'' in the
foreign exchange markets, but there was no mention of any effort to
reverse the decline of the yen, which has fallen by 42 percent
since its peak in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We issued a statement expressing our seriousness and urgency
of the matter,'' Sakakibara said. ``I think they believe our
seriousness.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that Japan has repeatedly promised before to
tackle its economic and banking troubles. And while it is pushing
through with a grand scheme, called the ``big bang,'' to
restructure the financial industry, it has backtracked on some of
its previous pledges to liberalize its markets and to create a more
open financial environment.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is also preparing a proposal, called the ``total plan,''
to eliminate the huge bad debts that threaten the nation's banking
system. But this was in the works well before the American-Japanese
intervention.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is not clear whether Clinton and other Americans were
expecting Japan to announce a major new effort to bolster the
economy. But Japanese officials seemed puzzled by what Clinton and
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin were thinking when they suggested
that bold new actions by Japan were in the works to justify a
higher value for the yen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very much afraid that he doesn't understand what's going
on in Japan,'' a senior Finance Ministry official said of Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   Summers emphasized that Japan needed to increase transparency in
the way its financial industry operates and to tackle the bad
loans. Japan also needs to work out a mechanism to deal with
troubled financial institutions, some of which are on a lifeline
from the Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is just about to start carrying out a $120 billion fiscal
stimulus package that includes at least $58 billion in real
spending and $30 billion in temporary income tax cuts. It has also
set aside nearly $220 billion to bail out the nation's banks, which
are burdened by more than $600 billion in bad or doubtful debt.
</P>
<P>
   Already, economists say that Japan is likely to see growth in
the third quarter this year. But regulators, officials and
economists abroad are still concerned that Japan is not moving fast
or far enough to alter radically the nature of its financial system
and the overall economy. So they fear that once the public money
runs out, Japan's economy may slump again.

ISRAEL CLINGS TO ITS `NUCLEAR AMBIGUITY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The nuclear tests by India and Pakistan have left
Israel alone in the world as a country that is widely believed to
have nuclear weapons but that has not acknowledged it does. For
now, Israel is apparently happy to leave it that way.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
office to the Indian and Pakistani tests has been to reiterate the
standard Israeli response to any inquiry about its nuclear program
_ ``We will not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into the
Middle East'' _ and to direct attention to Iran, which is believed
to be working on a nuclear weapon.
</P>
<P>
   There is the sense that the ``nuclear ambiguity'' introduced by
the construction of the Dimona nuclear reactor in the Negev in the
1950s and 1960s has served Israel well over the last three decades
in ``creating fear without creating anger,'' as the policy has been
defined, and is in no need of change.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's possession of nuclear weapons has been widely suspected
for decades, because the threat of such a weapon was presumed to be
the purpose behind the Dimona nuclear plant. But by refusing to
acknowledge them, Israel has spared the United States the need to
impose sanctions under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We managed to create sufficient suspicion for there to be
deterrent, without having gotten to a status of clarity which would
behoove sanctions against us,'' Shimon Peres, who as a young
official was instrumental in building Dimona, said in a recent
interview.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1995, Peres, then prime minister, came closest of
any Israeli official to acknowledging that Israel had the bomb and
suggested that it could get rid of it once it was at peace with all
its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there will be a regional peace, I think we can make the
Middle East free of the nuclear threat,'' Peres said then.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent television interview, Peres said, ``I built Dimona
in order to get to Oslo, not Hiroshima,'' referring to the
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord worked out in Norway. The purpose
of letting the Arabs believe that Israel could not be defeated in
war, he said, was to persuade them to make peace.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb built by the Muslim nation of Pakistan, Peres argued,
could change that. ``As far as the Arabs are concerned, the
`Islamic bomb' is not a strategic asset, but rather a psychological
one,'' he said. ``The bomb will make them more arrogant and enhance
among them the desire to annihilate Israel. That's the big
danger.''
</P>
<P>
   The original purpose of Israel's nuclear program was apparently
not only to deter the Arabs, but also to dissuade their patron at
the time, the Soviet Union, from trying to use a nuclear threat
against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   According to a special report by Jane's, the British-based guide
to the world's arsenals, ``Israel first deployed its nuclear
weapons in 1968 to deter an unconstrained Soviet attack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For decades,'' Jane's wrote, ``the Israeli Defense Force
General Staff had to plan to execute stopwatch wars, knowing that
the U.S.S.R. would intervene politically to rescue their client
states when they were on the verge of total defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Within Israel, discussion of such issues has been and still is
constrained by the secrecy imposed on the entire nuclear program.
But considerable information has emerged abroad through
intelligence reports, books and publications like Jane's.
</P>
<P>
   The most thorough of the books, ``The Samson Option'' (Random
House, 1991) by the investigative reporter Seymour M. Hersh,
asserted that Israel had ``hundreds'' of tactical and strategic
nuclear weapons, including more than 100 nuclear artillery shells
and ``hundreds of low-yield neutron warheads capable of destroying
large numbers of enemy troops.''
</P>
<P>
   A study in Jane's Intelligence Review last September examined
satellite photographs of what it described as an Israeli missile
base at Zachariah, several miles southeast of Tel Aviv, and
concluded that ``Israel's nuclear arsenal is larger than many
estimates.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane's said that the site housed about 50 missiles it identified
as Jericho-2, which, it said, are estimated to have a maximum range
of about 3,000 miles with a warhead of about 2,200 pounds. The
report said the installation also contained nuclear bombs for use
from bombers.
</P>
<P>
   Jane's said the five bunkers at the site could easily store 150
weapons. ``This is more than other reports state and supports
indications that the Israeli arsenal may contain as many as 400
nuclear weapons with a total combined yield of 50 megatons,'' the
study said.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz recently reported that a
Rand Corporation study commissioned by the Pentagon concluded that
Israel had enough plutonium to make 70 nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Hersh said that Israel succeeded in developing its
nuclear program in part because successive U.S. presidents, with
the exception of John F. Kennedy, turned a blind eye to the program
for political reasons, one of which was to avoid a confrontation
with American Jews.
</P>
<P>
   One question among analysts and politicians here is whether the
unexpected rise of two more declared nuclear powers might embolden
Arab and other third world countries to seek nuclear might.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some editorial talk about Pakistan's introducing an
``Islamic bomb,'' the prevailing sense among analysts is that the
confirmation of Pakistan's long-known nuclear secret does not
change the immediate strategic balance in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pakistan is not perceived as a an `Islamic threat,' nor as one
which would give nuclear know-how to Iran,'' said Joseph Alpher,
the director of the Jerusalem office of the American Jewish
Committee and an expert on military affairs. ``They could have done
that anytime over the past 10 years, and haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   Another expert, Reuven Pedatzur, who teaches military strategy
at Tel Aviv University, said: ``There will be an effect, though not
directly on Israeli policy. The change in my view is that the
threshold will now be a little bit lower than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``What could happen when Iran finishes developing its nuclear
weapon and has to decide whether to test it or to declare the
weapon, the pressure against it will be lower. India and Pakistan
indicate that the cost will be very low _ for the time being, the
only real sanctions are by the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if Iran declares, then it's almost inevitable that Israel
will have to declare.''
</P>
<P>
   Alpher agreed on the negative effects of the new tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly a defeat for efforts to prevent nuclear
proliferation in the third world, and that is the net bottom
line,'' he said. ``My sense is that this is bad for the U.S.
profile as the sole superpower charged with keeping order and
preventing things like this from happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It serves a very stark reminder that the clock is ticking on
the emergence of a nuclearized Middle East, with Iran as the prime
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Alpher's conclusion, and Peres', is that Israel should work as
quickly as possible to secure peace with its neighbors and the
Palestinians.

 By PHILIP SHENON and DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government's investigation of a 1996 terrorist
bombing that killed 19 U.S. airmen in Saudi Arabia has collapsed
over disagreements with the Saudis, and Clinton administration
officials now say they may never be able to determine who carried
out the attack.
</P>
<P>
   In frustration, FBI Director Louis Freeh has quietly pulled out
the dozens of investigators initially rushed to the scene of the
bombing at the Khobar Towers apartment complex in eastern Saudi
Arabia, leaving behind only a single agent as a legal attache and
liaison to the Saudis.
</P>
<P>
   The departments of Justice and Defense have vowed that they will
not close the books on the investigation, which began two years ago
this week after a fuel truck packed with tons of explosives
detonated outside the apartment complex. About 500 people were
wounded in the blast.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration's insistence that it remains
committed to the case is at odds with other signs that the
investigation has dissolved into a muddle of inconclusive evidence
and ill-feeling between the United States and Saudi Arabia, its
closest ally in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence suggesting that Iran sponsored the attack has further
complicated the investigation, since the United States and Saudi
Arabia have recently sought to improve relations with a new,
relatively moderate government in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   There is no indication that the White House, the State
Department or intelligence agencies have directed the FBI to back
off the case, but the prospect of improved relations may have made
it less likely that broad assertions of Iran's role in the bombing
would be accepted without concrete evidence.
</P>
<P>
   As the case languishes, families of the American victims are,
for the first time, complaining openly about the slow pace of the
investigation. They also assert that the case is not being pursued
aggressively because of U.S. fears of offending Saudi Arabia, a
principal oil supplier to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ignoring us doesn't make us go away,'' said Fran Heiser of
Palm Coast, Fla., mother of an Air Force master sergeant who was
killed in the explosion. ``Everybody is forgetting about this case.
These guys didn't die so much for their country as they died
because of their country.''
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the case offers a bitter, if revealing, lesson in the
limits of law enforcement in the post-Cold War world, in which the
United States has asserted its authority to operate overseas to
combat terrorism, drug trafficking and organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   What may have been the FBI's best hope of cracking the case _
the arrest of a Saudi dissident opposed to the royal family who
initially suggested that he was involved in the attack _ evaporated
last year when he reneged on a plea-bargain agreement and changed
his testimony. He insisted that he had no information on the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi, Hani Abdel Rahim Sayegh, is now in the custody of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service at an undisclosed location,
awaiting deportation to Saudi Arabia, where he is likely to be
beheaded. Even if he reversed himself again and agreed to testify,
U.S. officials say, his credibility is now so tainted that his
account might be of little use.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials acknowledge that the FBI is stymied. They say
there is no reason to believe that they will ever obtain the Saudi
cooperation necessary to determine who carried out the attack. ``By
ourselves, there's not much we can do,'' one U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno and Freeh have publicly criticized
the Saudis for a lack of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say the Saudis have refused to allow them to
interrogate dozens of suspects arrested by the Saudis and to review
critical evidence. It took months, they said, for the Saudis to
agree to allow the FBI to inspect the getaway car used by the
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi Embassy in Washington said it had no comment on the
investigation, but American business executives and others close to
the Saudi government said that the Saudis were equally frustrated
by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   They said the Saudis described the bureau as high-handed in its
dealings with the kingdom and reluctant to accept the validity of
evidence gathered by the Saudis suggesting that the attack was
carried out by Saudi dissidents with the help of Iran. The
evidence, they said, included videotapes of confessions by some of
the suspects and wiretaps of their conversations with other
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the Saudi government said that the FBI was
hypocritical in its complaints about a lack of Saudi cooperation
since the bureau had refused to share much of its intelligence
information with the Saudi Interior Ministry, its counterpart in
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. officials do not deny that the Saudi government's
theory about an Iranian tie may be correct, they say that the
evidence that the Saudis have shared with them has been
inconclusive and would be of little value in a U.S. court. Freeh
once described the Saudi evidence as little more than ``hearsay.''
</P>
<P>
   As the case languishes, families of the American victims of the
bombing are, for the first time, complaining openly about the slow
pace of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   They say they fear that the Clinton administration has allowed
justice for their loved ones to be sacrificed to the complexities
of the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Haun of Cocoa Beach, Fla., the widow of Capt. Leland Haun,
an Air Force navigator who was killed in the blast, said that she
was especially angry with the Defense Department, which she said
bore a special responsibility since the victims were U.S.
servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, she said, seemed unwilling to press the Saudis to
cooperate in the investigation, possibly because it might
jeopardize the agreement that allows the United States to station
thousands of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia. Since the 1991 gulf war,
the United States has used Saudi Arabia as a base for air patrols
over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``They let the Saudis get away with a lot of things because of
the oil,'' she said. ``They need to go to the Saudis and say,
`Look, we lost a lot of people, we need your help.' But the
Pentagon won't do that. They're weak.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Defense Department insists that it is closely
monitoring the FBI investigation, it insists that it cannot
interfere in the work of criminal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very clear from the beginning: This is the FBI's
job,'' said Ken Bacon, the Pentagon's chief spokesman. ``We don't
ask the FBI to fly F-16s over Iraq and they don't ask us to take
over their investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   The families of the victims say the Pentagon's attitude smacks
of callousness.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Department officials acknowledge that during a visit to
Saudi Arabia in February to consult with the Saudis about a
proposed military strike on Iraq, Defense Secretary William Cohen
did not request _ and did not receive _ a briefing from the Saudis
on the status of the Khobar Towers investigation.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Saudi investigators have attempted to maintain a facade
of mutual assistance, with periodic pledges of cooperation and
occasional discussions of the case. But Clinton administration
officials say that whatever substantive cooperation did exist
between the FBI and its counterpart in Saudi Arabia is largely
over.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with intelligence, law enforcement and diplomatic
officials indicate that the inquiry into the 1996 attack unraveled
over predictable issues, most important the clash of cultures
between law-enforcement officials from the United States and those
from a feudal kingdom whose rulers have no history of allowing
foreigners to meddle in the work of their internal police.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end of the day, there is a big cultural gulf here,''
said a senior administration official. ``Neither side has a great
deal of experience in dealing with each other in these matters. The
FBI has no history of involvement in the kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of Iranian involvement has greatly complicated the
investigation, especially since the United States had at one time
threatened a military strike against any foreign government
involved in the 1996 attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis insisted early on in the case that there was an
Iranian connection to the blast and arrested dozens of Saudi
dissidents, including several who had been educated in Iran and had
ties to the Lebanese militants Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed
terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   Any conclusive finding that Tehran was involved in the bombing
could undermine the recent foreign-policy goals of the United
States and Saudi Arabia. Both countries have sought to improve ties
to Iran as a result of last year's election of President Mohammad
Khatami, a moderate who was spoken of his desire to end years of
hostility with the United States and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in a speech
in New York that the United States hoped to establish a framework
for improved relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the wall of mistrust comes down, we can develop with the
Islamic republic, when it is ready, a road map leading to normal
relations,'' she said. President Clinton called for ``a genuine
reconciliation'' between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis have gone much further recently in seeking an
improvement in its relations with Tehran. Last year Crown Prince
Abdullah traveled to a summit meeting of Islamic countries held in
Iran, where he met with Khatami and praised the new Iranian leader.
Commercial ties between the two nations have been restored.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the recent good will, people close to the Saudi
government say that the Saudis continue to believe that the Iranian
government sponsored Saudi dissidents who carried out the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   While he did not single out Iran for blame, the Saudi interior
minister, Prince Nayef ibn Abdul Aziz, said last month that ``Saudi
hands'' had carried out the bombing ``with the support of others.''
</P>
<P>
   People close to the Saudi government say that the Saudis have
been perplexed by the reluctance of the FBI to accept the validity
of evidence showing an Iranian link.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think that maybe this is an investigation that the
United States doesn't want concluded,'' said Nathaniel Kern, an
American oil-industry consultant who is close to senior Saudi
officials. ``My suspicion is that it would be terribly difficult
for the United States if the investigation concluded that Iran was
responsible for the deaths of 19 Americans. What practical steps do
you take? Do you put new sanctions on Iran? Do you bomb it?''
</P>
<P>
   While the identity of the bombers remains a mystery, U.S.
investigators say that the events of June 25, 1996, are now well
understood. The bombing, they say, was an extraordinarily audacious
plot, carried out with skill and military-style precision.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 10 p.m., a man driving a truck pulled to a stop at
the curb-side perimeter fence near the Khobar Towers apartment
complex in the eastern Saudi city of Dhahran, which was being used
as barracks for U.S. airmen involved in air patrols over southern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The truck driver jumped into a car waiting nearby and sped off.
Four minutes later, the night erupted in a fireball that shattered
windows half a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion blew inward and upward, shearing away the face of
the building housing the sleeping airmen.

CELL PHONES OFTEN UNRELIABLE FOR 911 USE IN EMERGENCIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ERIC MOSES  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you call 911 on your cellular telephone in Los
Angeles County, there's a 1-in-14 chance you'll get a busy signal,
simply because there are too few operators and too many callers.
</P>
<P>
   The California Highway Patrol, responsible for answering all of
these calls, says the explosion of cell phones is worsening a
life-threatening situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not keeping up,'' said Lynn Diebold, who supervises the
CHP operators who handle 911 calls countywide.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 140 emergency calls out of the 2,000 made every day
don't get through because operators are too busy _ often taking
report after report of the same car crash or stray dog on the
freeway, Diebold said.
</P>
<P>
   That is about seven times higher than what state regulators say
is acceptable for regular telephones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts of life are that when we have these large highway
incidents, the system will be blocked for a period of time,''
Diebold said. ``It might be a very short period, three or four
minutes or 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, 911 cell-phone calls can take longer to connect
than a regular telephone call because they must pass through the
CHP to the appropriate law enforcement or emergency services
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Although the CHP and state regulators have no record of anyone
suffering harm from delays, one dispatcher who asked not to be
named said he's had difficulty himself _ and he predicts disaster.
</P>
<P>
   On his way to work one day, the veteran employee dialed 911 to
alert the CHP about an object in the freeway, a high-priority call
for the agency. He said he was on hold for seven minutes before he
hung up, figuring he'd report it in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what, if I had a life-threatening emergency I
would not dial 911 on a cell phone. I would keep memorized or
program in the regular number to my local police department,'' the
employee said.
</P>
<P>
   Boosting the number of operators at the CHP's dispatch center
has proven to be difficult. The dispatchers are employed by the
state and must be added through the budget process. Recent requests
for more operators have been filled slowly, Diebold said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state process is a lot slower than the current pace of
wireless technology,'' Diebold said.
</P>
<P>
   However, lawmakers and the cell-phone industry have proposed a
law they say will make connecting 911 calls more certain and the
information more useful. Sponsored by the Cellular Carriers
Association of California and backed by the CHP and other public
safety agencies, the bill would:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ensure that emergency calls made outside of freeways are
routed directly to the nearest public safety dispatch center, not
necessarily the CHP. New technology would change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cell site has enough intelligence in it so that it can
feed the calls to the Glendale Police Department or Pasadena Fire
Department,'' said Melissa May, a spokeswoman for Irvine-based
Airtouch Cellular.
</P>
<P>
   _ Provide the police or emergency services operator with the
approximate location of the caller and the phone number.
</P>
<P>
   Cell-phone calls to 911 are not directed immediately to the law
enforcement or emergency services agencies that can help you. Calls
go to CHP operators who then must determine whether their officers
should respond, or the Los Angeles Police Department, Fire
Department, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, or any of the
law enforcement and emergency services agencies.
</P>
<P>
   All that takes time, and in emergencies response time is
critical.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, 911 calls from telephones go straight to police and
fire dispatch centers in the community where the calls were made.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, this system for routing cell-phone calls made
sense. The CHP was chosen by the Legislature in 1991 to take all
cellular phone calls because nearly all dealt with freeway
incidents. But now that people carry the mobile phones wherever
they go, about 30 percent of the Los Angeles calls _ or 199,000 _
have nothing to do with the highway.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, state Assembly Bill 909, co-authored by Assembly
members Helen Thomson, D-Vacaville, and George Runner, R-Lancaster,
is stalled in a Senate committee and faces stiff election-year
opposition from trial lawyers and a wireless phone users group.
</P>
<P>
   The state Public Utilities Commission requires land-line
companies to connect at least 99 out of 100 calls, including those
to 911.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study conducted by a group that opposes the bill,
between 12 and 16 cellular telephone calls to the 911 operator fail
to get through. Sometimes callers get busy signals or are out of
coverage areas, or some portable telephones are not powerful
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike calls made from regular phones, the phone number and
location of the caller do not show up on computer screens at the
CHP dispatch center. As part of the plan to improve the wireless
911 service, the state and the cellular industry will test a caller
identification and location system in the San Gabriel Valley east
of downtown Los Angeles this year.
</P>
<P>
   The program could begin within the next month and would last six
months, to give officials an idea of how well it works and how much
it costs, said Leah Senitte, who heads the state's emergency
telephone service system.
</P>
<P>
   Within three years, the industry, under orders from the Federal
Communications Commission, must be able to transmit the location of
all 911 callers to within a 125-yard radius 67 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   That's important, Senitte said, because ``wireless callers don't
realize, oftentimes, where they are when they make the call.''

<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Ask Phil Maloof for his most important
legislative proposal if he is sent to Congress in a special
election on Tuesday, and he has a ready reply: ``We need more
computers in the classroom for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   His Republican rival, Heather Wilson, was so eager to highlight
her bonafides on education that she did not mention that she was a
Rhodes Scholar and an arms negotiator in the Bush administration.
Instead, she noted with pride that she had been one of five
finalists to be superintendent of the Albuquerque public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Around the nation, candidates for state and local office this
year are talking far more about education than any other theme.
Nowhere is that better demonstrated than here in New Mexico's 1st
Congressional District, where a race to succeed Rep. Steven Schiff,
a Republican who died in March, sometimes resembles a contest for a
seat on the local school board more than an election to the U.S.
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wilson has tried to skewer Maloof, a Democratic member of
the state Senate, with television commercials that accuse him of
skipping sessions of the chamber's higher education committee.
Everywhere he goes, Maloof touts his endorsement from principals of
seven schools in his Senate district. His commercials attack Mrs.
Wilson for not voting in the last three school board elections
here.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the focus on education, the closely contested campaign
here in the foothills of the Sandia Mountains _ the only full-scale
congressional election before November _ offers an important
preview of what awaits voters (and even the candidates) as the
midterm election year unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   Attack commercials are alive and well. For all their pledges to
stay on the high ground and to condemn their opponents' efforts at
``character assassination,'' Maloof and Mrs. Wilson have not been
timid about flinging oratorical mud. In fact, both sides agree that
the campaign in this usually placid state is the nastiest they have
seen here in years.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by this race, it is also clear that Democrats still
intend to demonize Speaker Newt Gingrich, as they did successfully
in the 1996 elections. In a new Maloof commercial, the announcer
warns that Mrs. Wilson would abolish the Department of Education.
``Tell Heather Wilson to stop siding with Newt Gingrich,'' he says
as side-by-side photographs of Gingrich and Mrs. Wilson pop on the
screen. (Republicans, by contrast, have not featured Clinton, who
is fairly popular in this state.)
</P>
<P>
   The commercials of the 37-year-old Mrs. Wilson, a former head of
the state Department of Children, Youth and Families, portray the
31-year-old Maloof as an empty suit. ``I just don't think he
understands the issues,'' the announcer intones. ``Phil's just too
young.''
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for the intense personal attacks may be another
reality of the 1998 campaign: With the hardy economy, the campaigns
here are having a particularly hard time engaging uninterested
voters. As a result, both the Maloof and Wilson campaigns are
running particularly aggressive telephone and literature drives to
get people to the polls Tuesday. Except for an organization
advocating term limits, which is running advertisements backing
Maloof, outside interest groups are preserving their advertising
budgets for the regular House races.
</P>
<P>
   While this race offers important clues for November, it is
crucial in its own right, which helps explain why Hillary Rodham
Clinton and Tipper Gore, as well as House Minority Leader Richard
Gephardt and Rep. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island are coming here
this weekend to campaign for Maloof. House Majority Leader Dick
Armey is scheduled to campaign here for Mrs. Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   If Maloof manages to wrest the seat from Republicans, then
Democrats would have to pick up only 10 seats in November to retake
the House. Officials on both sides agree that whoever wins the
election Tuesday to complete Schiff's term will be the favorite
when the candidates face off again in November. (Earlier this month
the two candidates won their parties' primaries for the general
election.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The winner has all the momentum going into the fall,'' said
Steve Grossman, national chairman of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The latest polls show the race dead even in the district, which
is split roughly between Republicans and Democrats. But polls show
that the Green Party candidate, Robert Anderson, is gaining ground
and could siphon votes from Maloof. Another Green Party contender
contributed to a Democrat's loss in a special House election in an
adjoining district last year.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Wilson is still trying to recover from a 60-second
Maloof commercial that says she ``abused her position of power''
when she was in the Cabinet by trying to remove a confidential case
file with potentially embarrassing information about her husband,
Jay Hone.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wilson asserted that the advertisement was ``full of
lies.'' Her aides concede, however, that it has been the single
most damaging development in the campaign. ``We lost eight points
overnight,'' said Steve Bell, Mrs. Wilson's chief strategist. ``It
was like a torpedo amid ships.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their deep ideological differences, Mrs. Wilson and
Maloof could not be more opposite in terms of their personal
styles, backgrounds and personalities. Maloof is from one of New
Mexico's wealthiest and most prominent families, which made its
fortune in the hotel, casino, liquor and banking industries. His
father, George Maloof, was so prominent that there is a bronze
statute of him in downtown Albuquerque, with the inscription,
``philanthropist/humanitarian.''
</P>
<P>
   Maloof has dipped into the family fortune to lend at least $1.2
million to his campaign, and is expected to spend closer to $2
million; Mrs. Wilson has raised nearly $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Maloof's biggest weakness is that he lacks a deep command of
many issues, is prone to misstatements and often comes off as
uncomfortable, even frightened, at campaign forums, particularly
when he ventures beyond the same stock Democratic talking points
that he repeats again and again. At debates, while he appears
earnest, he sometimes relies on thick briefing books. The missteps
are so frequent that the National Republican Congressional
Committee has enough material to regularly put out a flyer titled,
``Mal-OOPS!''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At their last televised debate, on Thursday night, Maloof was
asked whether he would support programs to protect the Mexican gray
wolf and spotted owl, even if they cost jobs. Instead of answering
the question, Maloof noted that he was supported by environmental
groups and favored the Endangered Species Act, and added, ``I enjoy
camping _ it's something I really enjoy.'' Then he quickly tried to
change the subject to education, only to be admonished by the
moderator.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wilson has sought to make Maloof's wealth an issue, a
strategy Lt. Gov. Gray Davis of California used in defeating a
multimillionaire rival, Al Checchi, in that state's Democratic
primary for governor this month. Her slogan, ``You just can't buy
the experience Heather Wilson has,'' is an adaptation of the Davis
slogan, ``Experience money can't buy.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview, Maloof was at a loss to explain the
differences between his race and that of Checchi. ``I don't know
what hurt him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wilson, a former Air Force captain who was on the National
Security Council staff in the Bush administration, is far more
articulate. But she has never run for elective office before and
lacks Maloof's deep roots in the community.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wilson moved to the state less than seven years ago, and
her accent sounds more like she is from her native New Hampshire
than from the Southwest. She was the hand-picked choice of Sen.
Pete Domenici, the state's senior senator.
</P>
<P>
   For all her smoothness on the stump, her own pollsters have
found that voters are put off by Mrs. Wilson's officious and
sometimes stiff manner and her preference for eye-glazing policy
discussions. Determined to make herself likable, Mrs. Wilson tries
to smile her way through campaign appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who has taken a leave as Domenici's chief of staff to run
the Wilson campaign in the final weeks, likens Mrs. Wilson to Sen.
Richard Lugar, R-Ind., who is highly respected but also one of the
more colorless lawmakers in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in an interview why she has hit so hard on what she
describes as Maloof's unpreparedness, Mrs. Wilson said: ``There are
a lot of people in Congress and in public life, average people of
average intelligence. Or even below average intelligence. I don't
think that's it, really. There's something else. Maybe it's
confidence or experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly in the final days of the campaign, officials on
both sides said their own polls showed that education had shot up
as by far the most critical issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the polling shows that the undecided vote is the female
vote,'' said Tom Hujar, Maloof's chief consultant, ``so both
candidates are going very heavily in terms of their appeals toward
women. So education is in the forefront.''

AS COLOMBIA PICKS NEW CHIEF, REBELS VOICE THEIR VIEW 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ For months now, the campaign posters and
rallies of Horacio Serpa of the Liberal Party have championed him
as the presidential candidate best able to negotiate an end to the
civil conflict that has virtually dismembered this Andean nation,
leaving some 31,000 dead.
</P>
<P>
   Serpa's campaign has promised that this former interior
minister, who is from the working-class oil port of
Barrancabermeja, could draw on his ties to the political left to
find the elusive path to peace.
</P>
<P>
   The only risk to this election strategy, political analysts
warned, was it might make Serpa appear overly friendly toward the
rebels and undermine his credibility with the military and business
elite.
</P>
<P>
   But in these final days of campaigning for the election of a
successor to President Ernesto Samper on Sunday, the two main rebel
groups issued stinging criticisms of Serpa.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,
known by its Spanish acronym FARC, blamed him for the breakdown in
peace talks with the government six years ago, and accused him of
waving the banner of peace solely for electoral gain.
</P>
<P>
   In a move worthy of his nickname, ``Sure Shot,'' Manuel
Marulanda, the rebel leader who had not been photographed publicly
in 10 years, held talks at his secret hideout with a representative
of Serpa's Conservative Party rival, Andres Pastrana, and allowed a
picture of the meeting to be published in newspapers here.
</P>
<P>
   The surprising turnaround in the two candidates' stands as peace
negotiators is only the latest in a series of strange twists in the
election that will end the presidency of Samper, who has spent most
of his turbulent term fending off accusations that Cali drug
dealers financed his election. In the first round of the election,
on May 31, Serpa won 34.64 percent of the votes and Pastrana 34.32
percent.
</P>
<P>
   If the bywords of the candidates have been ``peace'' and
``change,'' the word political analysts here frequently resort to
is ``paradoxical.''
</P>
<P>
   While the country is reeling in almost every sense after four
years of Samper _ economically, socially and politically _ the
leading candidate in voter surveys has been Samper's staunchest
defender and hand-picked successor, Serpa.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter of resignation as Samper's interior minister last
year, Serpa wrote, ``You, president, have set an example of
equanimity, dignity and patriotism, and under your leadership the
government will overcome with fortune the enormous challenges it
has been presented.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Serpa said in a pre-election debate that he would
not rule out extraditing his former boss to the United States
should Washington seek this. By contrast, Pastrana, whom voters
might have thought more likely to surrender the unpopular president
to the American authorities, rejected extradition for Samper.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana, 44, who is favored by the business community here, is
the son of former President Misael Pastrana. A former mayor of
Bogota himself, he could, in theory, make the most convincing case
for offering Colombia a fresh start, since he has been out of
government for the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   His television campaign advertisements list the violence,
corruption and other troubles of Colombia over the last four years
with Samper's face gradually fading into that of Serpa.
</P>
<P>
   But Pastrana lacks the charisma of Serpa, 55, who has managed to
put the Conservatives on the defensive by predicting that he will
privatize state industries. Pastrana has been reduced to pledging
his opposition to privatization.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana has produced a more detailed peace proposal than Serpa.
As part of a settlement, he has proposed ending the use of
herbicides to kill drug crops, calling instead for an
internationally backed plan to offer coca-growing peasants
alternative ways to earn a living.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana lacks the media backing and the government support
enjoyed by Serpa. The government ombudsman's recent review of
election campaign coverage showed television stations giving
substantially more air time to Serpa. The television stations
depend on the government for their operating licenses, while the
licenses of news shows are periodically subject to being revoked by
government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Noemi Sanin, an independent presidential candidate whose
unexpectedly strong showing in the first round of voting has turned
her into an arbiter of political morality, has also denounced the
Samper government for doling out free publicity to Serpa on the
government-run television station and for publicly supporting his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sanin, whose 2.6 million votes could provide the winning
margin for Pastrana, has declined to throw her support behind
either of the candidates. Doing so, she said in an interview on
Friday, would subvert the principles of her political movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of political behavior in our campaign,'' she said,
``was what? To desist with the vote that is directed, manipulated.
Instead, vote your conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Castro, a 59-year-old egg wholesaler, said he supported
Serpa because ``he knows our country's problems.'' Asked if Serpa
was not responsible for some of them, Castro gathered up a handful
of coins. He picked out a silver-colored coin to represent Samper,
as the chief who was responsible for his government's actions, and
a brass one to represent Serpa.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, they're not even the same color,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The most pressing issue, along with the economic troubles, has
been negotiating an end to the conflict that the military here has
been unable to win in the last 30 years. Both candidates have said
that, if elected, they will personally take charge of negotiations
with the guerrillas, and both said last week they would agree to a
guerrilla demand for the withdrawal of government security forces
from five municipalities as a requirement for negotiations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But it was Samper's agreement to pull back troops from the five
municipalities, a move that the rebels had been seeking
unsuccessfully for three years, that prompted the rebels' public
attack on Serpa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, with electoral ends to win votes and guarantee the
triumph of Dr. Serpa,'' Samper ``offers to evacuate,'' said a
communique from the rebels, which also criticized Serpa's record as
a peacemaker over the last 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   As chief peace negotiator under former President Cesar Gaviria,
the rebels say, Serpa closed peace talks in Mexico, ushering in the
``total war'' offensive against the guerrillas. As interior
minister under Samper, he saw the creation of armed citizen's
defense groups known as convivirs, which the guerrillas and human
rights groups both contended were mechanisms to legalize
paramilitary death squads. A Colombian court has now ruled the
defense groups illegal.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Serpa said he would name Alvaro Uribe Velez, the
former governor of Antioquia who spearheaded the creation of
defense groups around Medellin, as his defense minister, apparently
in an effort to establish his credentials among the military and
conservative landowners.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a rhetoric of peace, but in practice there's been an
increase in terror while he's been in government,'' said Carlos
Franco, a former guerrilla of the Marxist April 19 Movement, known
as the M-19, who has joined other political figures to support
Pastrana. ``I think all this led the FARC to conclude that Serpa's
chances of negotiating peace were low.''

AFTER YEARS OF CRITICISM, NYC PLANS TO REVAMP BILINGUAL EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew is preparing to step
into a political vortex in the fall with a plan to overhaul
bilingual education in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Senior school administrators say the effort will improve
education for immigrant children without compromising the
commitment to teach them in their native languages. They say the
plan has nothing to do with a voter referendum recently passed in
California that, barring a successful court challenge, will end 30
years of bilingual education there in a couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, they say, the plan is a response to years of criticism
of the city's bilingual-education programs _ which now serve
155,000 students speaking 145 languages _ and to the drive to raise
academic standards for all 1.1 million students citywide.
</P>
<P>
   The city spends $300 million annually on bilingual-education
programs, which have been criticized for the slow pace at which
some students learn English. Judith Rizzo, deputy chancellor for
instruction, who is overseeing the plan, said her staff would work
through the summer and present recommendations and cost estimates
to the Board of Education in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Among possible changes, she said, are adding English-language
classes and expanding classroom time for students in upper grades,
who master the language much more slowly than younger children.
That could mean after-school, weekend or summer classes to
supplement what is sometimes only three hours of English lessons
per week, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The board may also seek approval from the state Education
Department to continue teaching English to some students who have
joined mainstream classes after completing three years of bilingual
education. Normally, a waiver is required to continue any form of
bilingual education beyond three years.
</P>
<P>
   But completing bilingual education may become more difficult.
Dr. Rizzo's staff is reviewing the rigor of the test used to
determine whether students have learned enough English to leave
bilingual programs and join mainstream classes.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants' advocates said they would watch the process
carefully to insure that the city's commitment to bilingual
education was not diluted.
</P>
<P>
   New York has had a long, tortuous history with the subject
dating from the early 1970s, when a lawsuit by a Puerto Rican civil
rights group forced the city through a consent decree to adopt
bilingual education to address the academic shortcomings of
students whose primary language was Spanish. Subsequent settlements
expanded the program to all students whose English is limited.
</P>
<P>
   When immigrant parents register their children for school, they
fill out a survey on the languages spoken at home. School officials
use the information to decide whether new students must take an
English-proficiency test. Spanish, Chinese, Haitian Creole and
Russian are the languages most commonly spoken by New York City
students classified as ``limited English-proficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how well they do on the assessment test, they
either enter bilingual programs that offer academic instruction in
their native language coupled with English classes, or go into
mainstream classes but are pulled out for daily English lessons.
The latter option is also available for children whose parents do
not want them in bilingual classes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rizzo said she had reviewed bilingual education in the
system over the last few months and came away heartened by some
statistics and dismayed by others.
</P>
<P>
   Students are tested for English proficiency every year. She said
two-thirds of all students in bilingual programs stayed there for
three years or less, which surprised her.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not bad,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But older students take longer to learn English. For example,
while 48 percent of the pupils who enter bilingual programs in the
first grade ``test out'' within three years, only 11 percent of
those who start bilingual education in the ninth grade do so.
</P>
<P>
   And the quality of instruction in some subjects appeared to be
low, she said. Only about 20 percent of children in elementary and
middle schools who were classified as limited English-proficient
scored at or above their grade level on citywide math tests in
their native language. That compares with a citywide average of
63.1 percent who tested at or above grade level on the
English-language version of the exam, the California Achievement
Test.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rizzo said students who are not fluent in English need
better preparation to meet the higher standards administrators want
to impose. Among other changes, Crew has been driving to raise the
reading ability of all third graders and is seeking to end the
practice of ``social promotion'' to higher grades.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the state is tightening high school graduation
requirements, and by 2000 will require even students classified as
limited English-proficient to take the Regents English exam to
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Lopez, executive director of Aspira, the
Washington-based education and advocacy group whose lawsuit led to
the establishment of bilingual education in New York, said he was
already wary of the city's plan. He asserted that adding English
classes would be a harbinger of ``essentially English immersion,''
which would go against the consent decree's efforts to preserve
students' native languages.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rizzo stressed that the school system was not backing away
from bilingual education and said officials were also examining
``dual language'' schools as a possible model for bilingual
education, for example.
</P>
<P>
   New York City has five such schools, all Spanish-English, with a
Chinese-English one being planned. Native and non-native English
speakers are taught in English and another language. Dr. Rizzo and
administrators at those schools say non-English-speaking students
learn English quicker and better in an environment in which English
speakers are learning Spanish, too.
</P>
<P>
   At Public School 11 in Queens, about a tenth of the school's
1,300 pupils take part in the dual-language program. Students whose
best language is English are taught in Spanish for part of the day,
and students who speak Spanish learn English for part of the day.
The classes join in activities and students converse in both
languages, said Vivian Anemoyanis, the principal.

U.S. RETREATS ON INQUIRIES INTO URBAN HOUSING OFFICES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., La., Calif., Mo., Nev.)   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. _ Under mounting pressure from the Clinton
administration and mayors around the country, federal lawmakers
have reversed their decision to have the Department of Housing and
Urban Development's chief investigator examine housing programs in
three cities led by black mayors.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Baltimore, New Orleans and San Francisco two
months ago as targets of a House subcommittee's ``Urban Fraud
Initiative'' infuriated the mayors of those cities _ Kurt Schmoke,
Marc Morial and Willie Brown, respectively _ as well as mayors from
scores of other places, many of whom are meeting here for a few
days at the U.S. Conference of Mayors annual convention.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the mayors charged that racism played a role in the
selection of the cities.
</P>
<P>
   Mayors attending the convention were so angered by the proposed
investigation that they planned to approve a resolution Saturday,
calling for the suspension of any investigation until objective
criteria are developed to select cities in need of examination for
fraud and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   But the thrust of such a resolution was made moot in Washington
on Thursday, when the chairman of the housing subcommittee of the
House Appropriation Committee, Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., agreed
that the initial selections by Inspector General Susan Gaffney of
the Department of Housing and Urban Development should be set
aside. He also agreed that after new criteria were established,
those cities or others, and perhaps more than three, would be
selected for investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was not immediately available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, who is attending the convention
in Reno, hailed Lewis' decision. An early critic of the initial
plan, he said, `'If cities are selected fairly, then that's fine
with me. I'm all for enforcement and weeding out waste, fraud and
abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   The housing investigation was one of several significant issues
under discussion in Reno on Saturday among mayors from cities in
more than 40 states who are attending the four-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to President Clinton (by satellite) on Friday and
Cuomo on Saturday, the convention schedule also includes speeches
from Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, Labor Secretary Alexis
Herman and Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Cochran, the executive director of the mayors' conference,
said all their remarks are intended to elaborate upon the
administration's recent report, State of the Cities 1998, which
warned that many urban centers, despite their best financial
condition in decades, are facing mounting problems of education,
housing and joblessness.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the convention, Cochran said, was for mayors to
share ideas that are working so others may test them in their
cities.
</P>
<P>
   As the first Cabinet officer to follow Clinton addressing the
mayors, Cuomo on Saturday expressed the continuing need to satisfy
the growing demand for adequate housing for the poorest of
Americans, a pitch that is reflected in the housing department's
1999 budget request. He has asked Congress for $1.8 billion in new
program spending, which includes $585 million for 100,000 new
housing vouchers and $400 million for job creation in cities. In
each of the last five years, the department's budget has remained
flat, at around $24 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the mayors heartily supported his request, some
were still upset over the pending investigation of housing programs
for reasons, they said, they do not entirely understand.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City, Mo., president of the National
Conference of Black Mayors, a separate group from the one meeting
here, has been a vocal critic of Ms. Gaffney and Lewis for the
selections of cities led by black mayors. He said he called Ms.
Reno on Thursday and asked for a private meeting after she arrived
here to discuss what he called ``a rogue investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaver conceded that he was unaware Lewis had initiated a
change in policy. Yet even that did not satisfy him. ``At the very
minimum,'' he said, ``a statement ought to be issued by the
inspector general, if not, by Lewis, stating there never has been
any information that suggested these targeted cities had fraud or
corruption.''

PITTSBURGH IS SHOWCASE FOR WOMEN IN POLICING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Mich., Fla., Pa., D.C., Ohio., N.Y., N.J.)   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ A small placard hangs on a wall in Comdr. Maurita
Bryant's office so that she can always see it from behind her desk.
It reads, ``Of course women don't work as hard as men; they do it
right the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of 14 commanders on the Pittsburgh police force, Ms.
Bryant gets more than her share of opportunities to do things right
the first time. And so do hundreds of other women in blue who
patrol the streets of the nation's 48th largest city.
</P>
<P>
   On a police force of 1,100 officers, 25 percent are women, the
highest percentage of any law-enforcement agency in the United
States and more than twice the average percentage, says a recent
study by the National Center for Women and Policing, a Los Angeles
division of the Feminist Majority Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which reflects the composition of 100 agencies in
1997, also found that the Pittsburgh force included the nation's
highest percentage of women in command positions, 37.5 percent. In
addition to Commander Bryant, whose district has the highest crime
rate in the city, five other women in Pittsburgh are commanders, a
rank just below assistant chief and deputy chief.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh is just one of a number of major cities where crime
rates are steadily falling, and neither Commander Bryant nor any
other senior official on the force attributes the trend to the
large number of women who are officers. More likely, they agreed,
new community policing techniques and updated technology were
helping the department to turn from a reactive style, largely
responding to 911 calls, to a preventive approach.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Commander Bryant and other women on the Pittsburgh
force say the skills women bring to the job add vital components to
policing. Women, they say, are more inclined than men to use
communication skills to quell potentially violent situations, and
they can bring an extra sensitivity to situations involving
children and rape victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you bring diversity to any work environment, especially
policing, you add to the overall performance of the whole
department,'' said Chief Robert McNeilly, who agreed with many
women on the force who said that the days when male officers were
reluctant to have women as partners were generally over.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the progress women have made on the Pittsburgh
force, many fear a backslide. A 1976 court order demanding that for
every white man hired, the force had to hire a woman and two
members of minorities, one a man and one a woman, expired in 1991.
Ever since, the number of women and members of minorities joining
the force has slowed. And in a recent lawsuit against the city,
eight white men who failed to get jobs on the force, won
settlements in a reverse discrimination case.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here say the main impediment to recruiting highly
qualified women _ and men _ is the strong national economy, which
is enabling private industry to offer higher pay for entry-level
positions to people who would be attracted to a career in law
enforcement. In addition, municipal budget constraints, as
elsewhere, have slowed hiring. McNeilly said he did not expect the
city to replace officers who retired or resigned for more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   But those explanations ring hollow to people who track the
advances of women in law enforcement. Recalling the days of the
court order, Penny Harrington, president of the group that
conducted the survey, said, ``When they were forced to find women,
they found them.''
</P>
<P>
   McNeilly and Mayor Tom Murphy said they remained sensitive to
the issue and they vowed to take new approaches to find qualified
women for the force. They said they intended to step up their
recruiting efforts and to focus on women leaving the military as a
likely pool of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Harrington criticized that approach, calling it ``the
old way'' of thinking. ``Why not look on college campuses, nursing
schools, look for paralegals and social workers?'' she asked.
``They already have the mindset to help people, not kill them.''
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, at least, Pittsburgh remains a showcase for
women in policing. The survey found that only five other cities _
Detroit, Miami, Philadelphia, Washington and Toledo, Ohio _ had
police forces in which women accounted for 20 percent of officers.
In all those cities but Miami, the strong presence of women was
aided by a court order, the survey found. On Miami's force of 2,920
officers, no woman serves in a command position.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the survey found that 42 agencies _ including the
police departments in Nassau County, N.Y., and Newark, N.J., the
state police in New York and New Jersey, and the Port Authority of
New York-New Jersey _ had fewer than 10 percent female officers in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Commander Bryant, 45, who is black and a divorced mother of two
grown daughters, leads a district of 124 officers and supervisors
who patrol a zone where more homicides are committed than in any
other district in the city. She joined the force in 1977, when she
was just looking for a dependable job, she said, ``and the idea of
having a female supervisor was unheard of.''
</P>
<P>
   As she rose in rank over the years, she said, attitudes slowly
changed as men on the force grew more comfortable with women
because of the skills women brought to the job.
</P>
<P>
   In many situations, Commander Bryant said, women serve as a
soothing balance to the macho tendencies of male officers, a
situation that is influencing men on the force.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Rosato-Barone, 40, the commander of another high-crime
zone, who joined the force in 1979, agreed, saying: ``I think
adding women to the force has helped make the men more sensitive.
They hate to hear that they are becoming touchy-feely; they prefer
the image of tough and strong. I beg to differ. They're human
beings like everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling her days as a patrol officer, Commander Bryant said,
``There were situations where if I had approached them like a man,
acting super tough, I'd have gotten knocked on my butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Job skills aside, women on the force say there is still some
resentment among male colleagues, especially older officers who
were on the force before the court order changed its makeup. Sgt.
Jim O'Brien, a veteran of 28 years who works in Commander Bryant's
zone, said he, among other men, was slow to ``welcome women with
open arms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of men accept the women now,'' he said. ``But
there are always a few who still don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Commander Bryant, who grew up in a housing project and saw
police officers as people to be feared, conceded that old ways die
hard among some officers. But most men working under her command,
she said, dare not display any signs of discomfort or disrespect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hear any snickers,'' she said. ``When you have to
discipline a male officer, with white guys you usually see a level
of red in their face, and with black guys, you see them tense their
jaw muscles. It's interesting to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   But the surest sign of progress, she said, may be the blackboard
in the men's room, on which officers scribble complaints and nasty
remarks _ or so she is told.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far,'' she said with a smile, ``I don't think I've been on
it.''

   CLINTON-TRIP _ When he visits China beginning next week,
virtually everything President Clinton does _ every step he takes,
every place he goes, every bite he eats _ will have been
choreographed weeks in advance by a horde of advance men and women
who will have scheduled every second of his trip. After spending
hours studying videotapes of the routes Clinton will take, Secret
Service agents will have ensured that manhole covers are sealed and
air ducts blocked to prevent potential assassins from planting
bombs. His armor-plated limousine will have been flown ahead.
Hotels will have been comandeered for the president and his
entourage. Detailed briefing books will have been prepared for him,
providing classified information on the ranking officials with whom
he will meet. Phone banks will have been put in place for the
traveling White House press. Sophisticated electronics gear will
have been installed so the media can beam images back to the United
States. In all, hundreds of advance people will have worked around
the clock and millions of tax dollars will have been spent to make
sure the whole thing goes off without a hitch. (Deans, Cox News

   IRAN-SOCCER _ TEHRAN, Iran _ The U.S. plays Iran in the World
Cup soccer tournament Sunday. Except when Iraq is in crisis, Iran
is probably the biggest story in the Middle East right now. There
were huge street celebrations when Iran qualified for the
tournament. People said they bordered on political outbursts, and
there was concern among Iran's Islamic fundamentalist rulers when
many women celebrants removed their head coverings in violation of
religious dictates. Many other Iranians hope the match will lead to
a normalization of relations between the United States and Iran
after two decades of hostility. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

U.S. DETAILS 6 NEUTRAL COUNTRIES' ROLE IN AIDING NAZIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.C., Switzerland, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, Portugal,
Argentina)  (mk) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ever since the current uproar erupted over the fate
of looted Nazi gold, the role that Switzerland played in helping to
finance Hitler's war machine has been the focus of debate.
</P>
<P>
   But as investigators in the United States and other countries
have scoured musty archives of World War II for clues, they have
repeatedly stumbled over evidence raising broader questions about
the nature of neutrality during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Those questions have now come to the fore in a State Department
report that takes a broad look at the role played by all of the
major neutral countries in aiding Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The report _ which looks at Spain, Sweden, Turkey, Portugal and
Argentina, in addition to Switzerland _ highlights the degree to
which each country created its own definition of neutrality to
survive and to prosper at a time when all the old rules had been
thrown to the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our report indicates the complexity of the notion of
neutrality,'' said Stuart Eizenstat, under secretary of state for
economic, business and agricultural affairs, who coordinated the
State Department research effort.
</P>
<P>
   The standards for acceptable behavior by belligerents and
neutral countries had been part of the European tradition for
hundreds of years. But they offered little guidance to countries
facing the blitzkrieg, legal scholars and historians said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules in place were designed for wars that were not
crusades,'' said Detlev Vagts, an expert on international law at
Harvard Law School. ``The rules were designed for much smaller
wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Craig, a leading scholar of German history and professor
emeritus at Stanford University, said: ``When you come right down
to it, what standards could be applied to the neutrals during that
war? It was very difficult to be a small nation in a Europe
dominated by Hitler.''
</P>
<P>
   And so those legal guidelines that did exist were often simply
discarded, or consistently violated, by many of the neutrals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that these countries were committing unneutral
acts even by the standards of the times,'' Eizenstat said.
</P>
<P>
   Sweden was among the most aggressive in stretching the meaning
of neutrality throughout the war, the report found. Surrounded by
German forces in Norway, Denmark and Finland, Sweden was vulnerable
throughout the first few years of the war to German intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedes allowed German troops to cross their neutral
territory to join the German invasion of the Soviet Union, and also
allowed 250,000 German troops to use the Swedish railroad system to
travel between occupied Norway and Germany. The Swedish navy
provided escort service for German military supply ships, while
Swedish industry helped the Germans make up for the losses suffered
in their critical ball-bearing industry from Allied bombing raids.
</P>
<P>
   Spain went even further, creating a new international status by
declaring that it was a ``nonbelligerent,'' rather than a neutral.
Franco's fascist regime intended the claim of nonbelligerence to
signal that it was leaning Hitler's way but was not willing to give
up the benefits of staying on the sidelines. Yet even without
officially joining the Axis, Spain provided as many as 40,000
troops, supposedly volunteers, to fight on the Russian front
alongside the Germans in what was called the Spanish Blue Division.
</P>
<P>
   Spain also remained an important German source of wolfram ore, a
mineral used in making tungsten, a very hard metal critical to the
German industrial base, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Each neutral's definition of acceptable neutral behavior clearly
shifted along with the fortunes of war.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the onset, for example, Turkey joined an alliance with
Britain and France. But after the fall of France in 1940, it
dropped out and followed Spain's lead, declaring itself a
nonbelligerent. The British tried repeatedly to coax Turkey back
into their camp, but the Turks refused to declare war on the Axis
until Feb. 23, 1945 _ just as Germany was being crushed.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Turkey enjoyed the benefits of a bidding war
between Germany and the Allies for its chromite ore. Essential in
the manufacture of stainless steel, chromite was one of the few raw
materials considered essential to the German war effort for which
there were no adequate sources in German-held territory.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department report is most critical of the neutrals for
their refusal to give up their trade and financial relationships
with the Nazis late in the war, when Germany had long since lost
its ability to threaten or intimidate. In many cases, the neutrals
kept trading with the Germans until the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war could have been shortened by months or years if the
neutrals had cut back on their trade with Germany by 1943,''
Eizenstat said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerhard Weinberg, a World War II scholar at the University of
North Carolina, put it this way: ``The No. 1 motivating factor for
these countries was making money. The fact that they were making
agreements just before the end shows that they still wanted to make
as much money as possible from trade with the Germans.''
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the neutrals were reluctant after the war to give
in to Allied demands to return looted gold they had received in
trade with Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even though the Allies asked only that the neutrals
return gold they had received directly from Germany _ and not the
Nazi gold that had been transferred through Switzerland _ the
neutrals were still ``tenacious in not returning gold,'' Eizenstat
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the State Department report is being criticized for
adding relatively little to the historical record. Critics say it
is nothing more than a diplomatic effort to divert attention from
Switzerland's role in aiding the Nazis by showing that other
countries did, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are working at State, you want to not be seen as aiming
all your arrows at Switzerland,'' said Sidney Zabludoff, an
international economist who has written a study on Nazi gold
sponsored by the World Jewish Congress. ``I think because the
report tried to be diplomatic and deal with a number of issues
about neutral countries, it lost its focus.''
</P>
<P>
   But Eizenstat stresses that the new report is actually just as
damning of Switzerland as the previous State Department report on
gold looted by the Nazis, since it details how important
Switzerland was in financing German purchases of critical exports
from other neutral countries. The five other neutrals examined took
in about $300 million in gold from Germany _ much of it looted _
and about three-fourths went through the Swiss National Bank,
according to the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   In effect Switzerland was serving as Germany's central banker,
giving it the financial power to keep buying from other neutrals _
and keep fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report continues to point the finger at the Swiss,''
Eizenstat said, ``but it also looks at the neutrals to see what
uses the looted gold was put to.''

   Cumulus clouds will develop into isolated afternoon
thunderstorms Sunday in interior New England as low pressure which
has brought the recent unsettled weather lifts slowly offshore. Low
clouds and chilly onshore winds will prevail along the coast from
Maine to Cape Cod, though coastal areas should be spared the
showers that will plague the interior.
</P>
<P>
   Sultry air will dominate in the Middle Atlantic States. High
pressure aloft will provide sunshine from central New York to
eastern South Carolina, though a few thunderstorms could develop
over the Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Hot and muggy conditions will continue over much of the
Southeast. Morning low clouds will yield to afternoon sunshine
dimmed at times by cumulus clouds. Clusters of thunderstorms will
develop over the Ohio Valley and move southeastward, bringing
drenching rains to portions of the region. A vigorous jet stream
disturbance will spawn severe thunderstorms in Michigan with hail,
strong winds, and isolated tornadoes. Thunderstorms will also
develop along a cold front from southern Illinois through northern
Arkansas, while pesky showers and cool breezes swirl around low
pressure from Minnesota to eastern Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, searing heat will continue over Texas. Late day
thunderstorms will develop in the northern Rockies as a disturbance
rotates around low pressure aloft. Building warmth will dominate in
the valleys of the Pacific Northwest, while showers dot the peaks
of the Cascades. The Southwest will be sunny and seasonably warm,
with the exception of low clouds along the California coast.
</P>
<P>
   Summer Arrives
</P>
<P>
   The official start of summer is at 10:03 a.m. ET Sunday, but
astronomy, not meteorology, is the deciding factor. It is then that
the northward trek of the sun's rays across the planet will cease.
At that moment when the sun stood still, the summer solstice had
arrived. For the next six months, the direct rays of the sun will
move inexorably south, culminating in the winter solstice. But
alas, the summer season is the slowest to fade. As a result of the
elliptical shape of the earth's orbit around the sun, the Northern
Hemisphere summer lasts 93 days while winter is 89 days long.

   TEHRAN, Iran _ Iranians would love to see their national team
whip the United States in Sunday's World Cup soccer match in
France, but not because many still chant ``Death to America'' at
weekly prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is at a crossroads. Its 60 million people are testing the
limits of new personal freedoms and emerging from years of war and
world isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the soccer team has become the symbol of reform and
progress. That the team shares the same fields in France with the
major powers promises Iranians a brighter future, not just more
fights against the same old ``Satans.''
</P>
<P>
   So, when Sunday's game starts in Lyon, France, at 11:30 p.m.
Tehran time (mid-afternoon Eastern time), almost all Iranians will
be watching, but at home.
</P>
<P>
   There are no bars, let alone sports bars, in the Islamic
Republic of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Community centers had planned to show the game on big screens,
but those plans were scrapped out of what many see as government
concern that a win or tie could spark highly un-religious street
celebrations in the early morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people have a thirst for happiness. For 20 years, there
has been much mourning,'' said newspaper editor Mashallah Shams.
``If someone just goes out and dances in the street right now, they
will say he is crazy and stop him. But, if 20 million people start
dancing, no one can stop them.''
</P>
<P>
   There is the usual soccer fanaticism _ a fan recently scoured
the downtown strip of sports stores buying up 1,000 Iranian jerseys
for friends in the United States. Some universities postponed exams
and people have delayed summer vacations until after the World Cup
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But the love of Iranian soccer is better illustrated by impish
nine-year-old Samayeh Hemati. Under the required head scarf and
black cape, there's a soccer fan in blue jeans and sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   She plays with the boys in the street and saves a picture of her
favorite Iranian forward.
</P>
<P>
   Women might be the country's biggest fans, though they cannot
play on organized teams. When the team qualified for the tournament
in December, men and women danced side-by-side in the streets. The
ruling religious Mullahs were nervous, but did not dare try to stop
them.
</P>
<P>
   It had been 20 years since Iran made it to the World Cup. Since
then, Iranians replaced a brutal, American-backed, dictator with a
popular, but stern, Islamic revolution. They stormed the U.S.
Embassy in 1979, holding 52 Americans captive for 444 days. Later,
the Iranians saw one of their airliners shot down by a U.S. Navy
missile.
</P>
<P>

   TEHRAN, Iran _ Iranians would love to see their national team
whip the United States in Sunday's World Cup soccer match in
France, but not because many still chant ``Death to America'' at
weekly prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is at a crossroads. Its 60 million people are testing the
limits of new personal freedoms and emerging from years of war and
world isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the soccer team has become the symbol of reform and
progress. That the team shares the same fields in France with the
major powers promises Iranians a brighter future, not just more
fights against the same old ``Satans.''
</P>
<P>
   So, when Sunday's game starts in Lyon, France, at 11:30 p.m.
Tehran time (mid-afternoon Eastern time), almost all Iranians will
be watching, but at home.
</P>
<P>
   There are no bars, let alone sports bars, in the Islamic
Republic of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Community centers had planned to show the game on big screens,
but those plans were scrapped out of what many see as government
concern that a win or tie could spark highly un-religious street
celebrations in the early morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people have a thirst for happiness. For 20 years, there
has been much mourning,'' said newspaper editor Mashallah Shams.
``If someone just goes out and dances in the street right now, they
will say he is crazy and stop him. But, if 20 million people start
dancing, no one can stop them.''
</P>
<P>
   There is the usual soccer fanaticism _ a fan recently scoured
the downtown strip of sports stores buying up 1,000 Iranian jerseys
for friends in the United States. Some universities postponed exams
and people have delayed summer vacations until after the World Cup
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But the love of Iranian soccer is better illustrated by impish
nine-year-old Samayeh Hemati. Under the required head scarf and
black cape, there's a soccer fan in blue jeans and sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   She plays with the boys in the street and saves a picture of her
favorite Iranian forward.
</P>
<P>
   Women might be the country's biggest fans, though they cannot
play on organized teams. When the team qualified for the tournament
in December, men and women danced side-by-side in the streets. The
ruling religious Mullahs were nervous, but did not dare try to stop
them.
</P>
<P>
   It had been 20 years since Iran made it to the World Cup. Since
then, Iranians replaced a brutal, American-backed, dictator with a
popular, but stern, Islamic revolution. They stormed the U.S.
Embassy in 1979, holding 52 Americans captive for 444 days. Later,
the Iranians saw one of their airliners shot down by a U.S. Navy
missile.
</P>
<P>
   Iranians saw their cities bombed and hundreds of thousands of
men and children killed in the eight year war against Iraq. They
are just now restoring relations with many neighbors and flirting
with the United States, long called ``the Great Satan.''

BILL TO CAP DAMAGE AWARDS MAY FINALLY SURVIVE SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: W.Va., Wash.)   (bl)  
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 C.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate is poised to try yet again in July to
enact legislation that has been around in one form or another for
more than a decade _ a bill setting nationwide standards to limit
damage awards to people harmed by faulty products as diverse as
heart valves and tractors.
</P>
<P>
   Although its supporters have come tantalizingly close on several
occasions only to see legislative agreements fall to pieces at the
last moment, they are unusually optimistic this time around. The
main reason is that there is now apparent agreement among the
principals: the White House; Sen. Slade Gorton of Washington, the
chief Republican spokesman on the issue, and Sen. Jay Rockefeller,
D-W.Va., who has made product liability almost a personal crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it looks like it will happen this time, but it seems
you can never be sure on this issue,'' Rockefeller said in an
interview. ``In theory it should pass. The problem is to bring it
up as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott has told senators and
reporters that he now believes the measure has sufficient support
and that he expects to bring it to the floor for a vote around July
14. The principal obstacle to the legislation has always been in
the Senate, and not the House, supporters of the bill agree.
</P>
<P>
   The issue pits an array of business interests who favor limits
on court-approved damage awards against a coalition of consumer
groups and trial lawyers and their influential trade organization.
The nation's largest manufacturers have said that the bill to be
voted on next month does not go far enough and that they will
oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   Whether to regulate damages in court cases is among the most
complex and often abstract of issues. How should the United States
structure its civil litigation system to achieve maximum fairness
and accessibility?
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the measure contend that the legislation is needed
to put a cap on multimillion-dollar jury awards that are out of
control and inhibit manufacturers and add to consumer costs.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, like Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, a
consumer group in Washington, argue that by limiting awards for
punitive damages, which are typically given to express anger at
reckless or outrageously negligent actions, there is little
incentive for manufacturers to stop making unsafe products.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to battles over the merits of the argument, the
debate is being fought with millions of dollars in campaign
donations and lobbying fees. The trial lawyers are traditional
benefactors of the Democrats, while the manufacturers are among the
most generous sources of political donations for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   A measure to limit damages in product liability cases passed
both houses last year but was vetoed by President Clinton, who
asserted that it ``tilted the field against consumers.'' The
measure to be voted on in July is largely tailored to the
objections raised by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It would for the first time set national standards for product
liability lawsuits, including preventing litigation against
retailers and wholesalers unless they had altered the product.
</P>
<P>
   It would prevent damages if the product was misused or altered
by the consumer or if the user was drunk or influenced by drugs. It
would allow punitive damages only where there was evidence of
``conscious, flagrant disregard'' for safety on the part of the
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   It would also prohibit lawsuits for damages caused by durable
goods like machine tools or tractors that were more than 18 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's limits on punitive damages have been narrowed from
the original bill vetoed by Clinton, in which all companies would
have benefited. Under the current version, limits on punitive
damages would apply only to companies with fewer than 25 employees
or with annual revenues of less than $5 million. The limit on what
an injured person could collect would be $250,000 or twice the
actual damages a person suffers, that is, lost wages and medical
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The business community had been united in support of the
original bill. But when the punitive damages restriction was
limited to small businesses, the Civil Justice Reform Group,
composed of such companies as Du Pont, General Motors and Exxon,
recently wrote to Senator Lott saying it would not support the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller said that with the majority of the Senate's 55
Republicans supporting the bill along with about a dozen Democrats,
he is hopeful that there would be at least the 60 votes needed to
cut off any filibuster or extended debate.

SPORTS COLUMN: TUNNEL OF TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's the longest 468 yards in golf, a par 4 for
masochists. The fairway climbs to a slick green guarded by deep
bunkers and deep rough. As if its uphill length were not formidable
enough, it usually plays into a chill wind off the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   This is the 17th hole in Olympic's three-hole theater (of the
absurd?) where the 98th U.S. Open is very likely to be won and lost
Sunday. It begins with the 609-yard marathon 16th. It ends with the
18th's 347-yard tunnel of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if this year's Open turns on the 17th hole,
just as the 1987 Open turned there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 17th is really a par 5,'' said Payne Stewart, who took a
one-stroke lead into Saturday's third round. ``When you're standing
back there on the tee and you hit a great driver, you've still got
a 3-wood to the green, so it's really a par 5.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second round, Stewart made bogey there. On Thursday, his
2-iron crawled onto the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I made a 45-foot birdie putt,'' he said. ``But to me, it
was like an eagle.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's 3 was one of only eight birdies over the first two
rounds on the 17th, this Open's most difficult hole. Through 36
holes, the average score there was 4.69 strokes, up from 4.56 in
1987, when Scott Simpson's 10-foot par putt preserved his
one-stroke victory over Tom Watson.
</P>
<P>
   In that 1987 Open, the 17th was 40 yards shorter than it is in
this Open.
</P>
<P>
   For the Olympic Club members, the 17th is a par 5 of 522 yards
from the championship tee. But for the four Opens here, U.S. Golf
Association officials have preferred to use shorter tees and
decreed it to be a par 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a par 5 in my book,'' said Jeff Maggert, who was one
stroke off the 36-hole lead. ``Anyone who expects to make a 4 every
day, it's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1987's final round, Simpson had a one-stroke lead on Watson
when his second shot on the 17th drifted into the left bunker. When
he blasted out to 10 feet, a bogey seemed to loom, but he holed the
par putt. Watson, in the final group, had a par there, and Simpson,
up ahead, had a par at 18.
</P>
<P>
   Needing a birdie to force an 18-hole playoff, Watson rapped a
45-foot uphill putt that stopped inches short.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson had taken the lead with a 15-foot birdie putt on the
dogleg-left 16th hole, which is playing at 609 yards in this Open.
Over the first two rounds, nobody reached the 16th green in two,
and over the history of Olympic, only two golfers have reached the
green in two.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s, Bobby Jones once reached the 17th green in two,
but in that era, the fairway was hard, and the cypress and pine
trees that now tower on the left had not been planted yet. Last
year an Olympic member, Michael Blewith, did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can drive it in the fairway and lay it up in the
fairway, you should be thinking birdie,'' said Tom Lehman, who shot
75 Friday after an opening 68. ``The problem is, the lay-up shot
there is very difficult. It's easy to lay up in the rough.''
</P>
<P>
   The rough at this Open has been compared by Tom Watson, the 1982
Open champion, ``to hitting into a blow of spaghetti, 20-pound test
spaghetti.'' But as thick as the rough is, old-timers here insist
it was deeper in 1955, especially to the left of the 18th fairway.
</P>
<P>
   In Ben Hogan's playoff with the virtual unknown Jack Fleck that
year, he trailed by one stroke going to the treacherous tunnel of
the 347-yard final hole. After yanking his tee shot into the left
rough, he needed three slashes with his wedge to escape, then
needed a 40-foot putt to save a double-bogey 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody had ever seen anything like that rough before,'' Fleck
has said. ``It was close to a foot deep.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final round in 1966, Arnold Palmer, who had a
seven-stroke lead on Billy Casper with nine holes to play, still
had a one-stroke lead on the 18th tee. Palmer pulled a 1-iron into
the rough and wobbled to a bogey, creating an 18-hole playoff that
Casper won.
</P>
<P>
   On the 18th's ski-slope green, nothing is certain. Stewart's
10-foot sidehill birdie putt Friday barely slid below the cup, then
rolled down the slope about 20 feet away. To Stewart, the pin
position Friday on the 18th was ``bordering on the ridiculous.''
But his putting problem there Friday has now alerted others to the
slippery slope.
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday the leaders in this year's Open will be center stage
in the theater of Olympic's 16th, 17th and 18th holes with the
trophy up for grabs. The winner is most likely to be the golfer who
keeps his tee shots out of the rough.

<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Maurice Greene felt he was ready to break the
world record for the 100-meter dash. His coaches said he was ready.
His opponents said he was ready.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, the world champion gets a big chance. The
occasion is right _ the U.S. outdoor track and field championships.
The heat and humidity provides good sprinting weather because his
muscles can get loose. The opposition is expected to include such
world-class sprinters as Dennis Mitchell, Tim Montgomery and Brian
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   And Greene, like many other Americans, was not enamored with the
frequent breast-beating of Donovan Bailey, the Canadian who set the
record of 9.84 seconds in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, the 23-year-old Greene moved toward his goal. In
the quarterfinals, he ran impressively and won in 9.84 seconds,
helped by a following wind too strong to allow record recognition.
In the semifinals 2 hours 20 minutes later, although he did not
look overly sharp, he still won cleanly in 9.96 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first round,'' he said, ``I was thinking too much about
the record instead of running my race and letting the record come
to me. If I'm just thinking about my technique and run my own race,
I will be OK If I don't, I'll be in trouble. So in that respect,
the semifinal was good.''
</P>
<P>
   Very good, according to two victims in that race. One was
30-year-old Kevin Little, a high-level sprinter for a decade. The
other was 19-year-old Ja'Warren Hooker, a Washington freshman and
one of America's sprint proteges.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll bring out the best in you,'' Little said. ``You have to
be ready to run every time you race him.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Little knew what to expect. Hooker, who had never run
against Greene before, faced him in the quarterfinals and
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``His first 50 meters is pretty controlled,'' Hooker said. ``But
in the last 50, he explodes. The first time I ran against him here,
I was next to him and I was with him for 50. Then he really took
off.''
</P>
<P>
   John Smith, who coaches Greene, could have warned Hooker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maurice is a world champion when he puts his mind to it,''
Smith said. ``He usually comes up with results. He has a passion
for whatever he does and always lays it on the line. In the fall of
1996, Greene went to Los Angeles from Kansas City, Kan., with
basically nothing. But he has a serious commitment. He's a very
serious man. I enjoy working with him. I like working with people
who have a purpose in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith also coaches the sprinters at UCLA, so Art Venegas, UCLA's
throwing coach, sees Greene on the practice field daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competitively,'' Venegas said, ``Maurice Greene is a freak of
nature. I'm a track fan as well as a coach, and I like him. He
seems to rise to the challenges in front of him. Indoors, Jon
Drummond was in better shape, but Maurice found a way to get the
world record in the 60 meters. He's got pure, unadulterated
competitiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   With all that, a world record was still a big order.
</P>
<P>
   ``World records are looked at as something almost impossible,''
Smith said. ``He looks at them as something he can do, and I like
that. He's interested in being the fastest 100-meter guy. I don't
try to control what's natural. I just try to manage it.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Greene.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have world championships or Olympic Games this
year,'' Greene said, ``so the world record is the most important
thing. It was in the U.S. for so long, it's time for it to come
back.''
</P>
<P>
   SPIKE MARKS
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's winners included John Godina in the men's discus
throw (220 feet 1 inch), Marc Davis in the men's 5,000 meters (13
minutes 40.62 seconds) and Lynn Jennings in the women's 10,000
meters (34:09.86). For the 37-year-old Jennings, it was the seventh
title in 12 years in this event and her 38th national title
overall. &QL;

   Victor Romagna, an outspoken force in America's Cup yacht racing
for a quarter of a century, died June 12 at his home in Annapolis,
Md. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Romagna sailed on the crew of three successful America's Cup
defense teams: the 12-Meter Columbia in 1958, Weatherly in 1962 and
Intrepid in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   A sailboat efficiency expert, Romagna was instrumental in
rearranging the layout of Intrepid for the 1967 cup races. The
yacht's winches were moved below deck to reduce clutter, and the
cockpit was moved forward to improve viewing.
</P>
<P>
   Romagna and Emil (Bus) Mosbacher Jr., who was Intrepid's skipper
in 1967, led their United States America's Cup team to victory
against the Australian challenger, Dame Pattie, in a 4-0 sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the quintessential Corinthian yachtsman,'' Mosbacher,
who died last year, said in 1996 about his friend and sailing
colleague. ``He believed it was important to give kids an
opportunity to go sailing because they loved the sport, not because
they were going to be paid a salary. He wanted them to learn to
sail under the utmost pressure, but as amateurs. He was a kind of
scoutmaster for the crews.''
</P>
<P>
   During the cup races of 1980 and 1983, Romagna served as
secretary of the America's Cup Selection Committee of the New York
Yacht Club, which was the guardian of the America's Cup for 132
years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, when the club finally lost its ornate silver trophy to
Australia, Romagna was one of the first to concede that he had
mixed feelings about seeing it go. He had become increasingly
agitated over the creeping commercialism in cup racing and bemoaned
the loss of amateurism in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Romagna was born in Port Washington, N.Y., and lived there until
1981, when he retired to Annapolis. He learned to sail on Manhasset
Bay and competed on Long Island Sound during the 1940s in several
classes of small boats. When he was 17, he sailed in his first
Newport Bermuda Race.
</P>
<P>
   He competed in 22 Bermuda races, two trans-Atlantic competitions
and three British Fastnet Races. He was inducted into the America's
Cup Hall of Fame in 1994 and was an honorary trustee of the South
Street Seaport in New York. He was sailing coach at the U.S. Naval
Academy from 1981 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Romagna served in the Coast Guard during World War II. From 1960
to 1981, he worked at Ivy Hill Corp. a printing firm, and was vice
president of sales when he retired.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Louise; three daughters, Lisa
Frappaolo, of Port Washington, Marion Jones, of Catonsville, Md.,
and Lenore Alexander, of Annapolis; a brother, Leonard, of Sun City
Center, Fla., and four grandchildren.

STUDY OR HUMAN EXPERIMENT? FACE-LIFT PROJECT STIRS CONCERNS. 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PHILIP J. HILTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a quest for the ``ultimate face lift,'' as one
plastic surgeon put it, doctors in Manhattan conducted a study a
few years ago in which they performed two different operations on
21 patients _ one on each half of the face _ to see which came out
better.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials, who were alerted to the study by an anonymous
complaint, investigated whether the surgeons violated guidelines
governing informed consent in human experiments, but determined
that they had no jurisdiction in the case. The study was published
in the journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery in December 1996,
but has only recently been noticed outside the field.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved 20 women and a man, whose average age was 59,
who went to Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital in 1992 and 1993
for face lifts, for which they paid. On one half of the face,
surgeons cut the skin at the hairline and pulled it back and up.
They pulled and tightened the underlying muscle, as if gathering
the pleats of a skirt, but did not cut it.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, more aggressive procedure, other surgeons cut
beneath skin and tissue from the side of the face toward the nose,
cut and pulled the underlying muscle back and upward, then
reattached it. Some believe this procedure to be more effective in
the long run, but it also carries a higher chance that nerves will
be accidentally cut and the face partly paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeons, who were seeking to resolve a 20-year debate about
which procedure is more effective, say there is little if any
noticeable difference in the two sides of the patients' faces. But
the study checked the patients once, one year after the procedures,
and other plastic surgeons say it may be years before it is known
whether the patients' faces will show any irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the ethical dispute is whether federal and state
rules concerning medical experiments on humans applied to this
study. Critics say that this was the case: that the surgeons should
have had the study approved in advance by their hospital's ethics
committee, referred to by doctors as an institutional review board,
or IRB. The critics also contend that the doctors should have given
patients consent forms explaining in detail the procedures and
risks they faced.
</P>
<P>
   The study's authors say that they did not seek committee
approval or give detailed consent forms because neither was
necessary. Since the two procedures were well established, they
said, the study was not a human experiment. And so the patients
were asked to sign a general consent form given to all surgery
patients and were simply given an oral description of the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The patients were told, `We are going to do different
procedures on the different sides of your face, as we need to for
your face,''' Dr. Sherrell Aston, the lead surgeon, said in a
telephone interview. He insisted that the patients were fully
informed about the procedure and not deceived in any way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a straightforward clinical kind of study, and had
nothing unusual about the design,'' Aston said. ``It's done all the
time.'' He also said that if the different procedures had yielded
different results, he and his team would have stopped the study and
fixed the patients' faces for free.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors who carried out the study agreed to contact some
patients for interviews, but ultimately, only one patient, speaking
on condition of anonymity, talked to a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   She is a woman in her 70s who said she was pleased with the face
lift she received from the doctors. Asked if she was aware that she
was the subject of a study, she said she was the type of person who
doesn't want to know much about what's going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``It was a long time ago, and I don't remember it
very well, but I do remember something about a new procedure they
were going to do. They said it would be for my benefit.'' She said
she has not noticed any difference in the two sides of her face
since the operations.
</P>
<P>
   Aston insisted that the study was proper. ``This was not an
experiment,'' he said. ``It was a clinical project to evaluate
surgical procedures. These were not experimental procedures we are
using. We didn't need to go to the IRB _ and I sit on the IRB
myself _ because it wasn't investigative research.''
</P>
<P>
   The law suggests otherwise. Under both federal and New York
state law, a human experiment is defined simply as an investigation
that uses people's bodies and is not required for the direct
diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a patient's condition. It
does not matter whether the procedures being used are experimental
or not, according to federal health officials.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arthur Caplan, director of the bioethics center at the
University of Pennsylvania, said after reading the study: ``This is
not a close call. Under both New York and federal law, this is an
experiment. And morally, there are red flags all over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hinkley, a spokesman for the New York state Department of
Health, said the department was starting to look into the case.
From an initial reading of the study, he said, it appears that the
researchers should have gone to an institutional review committee
and gotten formal written consent from the patients. If the Health
Department determines that the doctors violated state law, they
could face unspecified sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The federal watchdog agency that monitors human experiments, the
Office of Protection from Research Risks at the Department of
Health and Human Services, was alerted to the study by an anonymous
letter from New York, which said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear sir, I am writing (anonymously) to inform you of this
unauthorized medical study on unknowing human clinic patients.
These people had two different doctors and operations (on each side
of face) and were never told! The chairman (Aston) conducted the
study without institutional approval. We are not guinea pigs. Thank
You.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal agency concluded that the study was indeed human
experimentation, but that since no federal funds were used to
conduct it, it had no jurisdiction to investigate further.
</P>
<P>
   But one officer at the agency, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said the experiment was ``extremely disturbing in its
lack of concern for the patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Aston said the study proved that the more limited face-lift
procedure could do just as well. Nevertheless, he still uses both
procedures in his own practice, depending on the patient.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sam Hamra is a plastic surgeon in Dallas who was a resident
with Aston at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital. He said
he declined an invitation to participate in the experiment, and has
been critical of the study, which he called highly unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think probably over the years surgeons have done smaller,
more benign procedures differently on different sides of the face,
but nothing at this high a level, with higher potential
ramifications for the patients,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamra reviewed the study at the time, and in an article that
appeared in the same issue in which the study was published, wrote
that the surgeons in the study failed to carry out the more
extensive surgical procedure properly. That is why so little
difference between the two face halves was noted afterward, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that after conversations with Aston and others, he
believed the patients were not fully briefed by the surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they said something to them, but didn't make it
clear,'' he said in a recent telephone interview. Who, he asked,
would agree to participate in an experiment in which different
sides of the face are treated differently? ``There is no woman I
know of who would walk in and lay down for that,'' he said. ``They
might well be fine, but they also might end up looking wacky for
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Aston said that any criticism by Hamra was suspect because Hamra
was a champion of the more aggressive procedure in face lifts.
</P>
<P>
   Aston said he believed that Hamra felt the study discredited his
own work because it showed no apparent difference between the
extensive procedure and the simpler one. Even years before the
study, Hamra ``publicly and privately maligned my work,'' Aston
said.
</P>
<P>
   But other plastic surgeons have also expressed reservations
about the study.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joel Feldman of Harvard University said that he recalled the
debate over the study when it was first presented, and was at the
time supportive of the work.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after reviewing the journal article, he said in a
telephone interview: ``I have serious concerns about the study. I
think it probably should have been presented to an IRB, and it is
not clear'' that the patients gave their consent based on full
information about the procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Lorenc, who personally told the patients what was to be
done, said, ``We discussed with the patients the fact that we would
address the muscle different ways on both sides of the face.''

ANALYSIS: IN ALBANY, A YEAR TO TURN DEFEATS INTO ELECTION ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki began the year with a modest
list of things he wanted out of the Legislature: end parole for
violent felons, permit charter schools, allow casino gambling,
toughen penalties for juvenile criminals.
</P>
<P>
   He got none of those. But while the 1998 legislative session,
which ended Friday, may look like a bust for the Republican
governor, it gave him a few handy issues to use as he runs for
re-election this year, particularly the time-worn theme that
Democrats are soft on crime.
</P>
<P>
   He signaled as much in a news conference Friday afternoon in
which he reviewed a session that was widely seen as one of the
least eventful in memory. Pataki bemoaned the gridlock in the
Capitol, and blamed the Democrats who control the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single criminal-justice change we've tried to get was
fought tooth and nail in the Assembly,'' he said. ``I just think
there are an awful lot of people in the Assembly, particularly the
Assembly leadership, who go back to the old philosophy that it's
society's fault when someone is a violent criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's political advisers calculated that there was not much
he needed, politically, from this session, and they may have been
right. Polls show him with huge leads over his Democratic rivals,
and the governor seemed to spend more time this year touring the
state to promote his record than working in the Capitol to enhance
it.
</P>
<P>
   Even his allies in the Legislature say that except for the
parole issue, he did not break a sweat this year lobbying for his
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   He can tell communities in western New York and the Catskills
that see casinos as their best hope for economic development that
he tried, but he did not push the issue hard enough to raise the
ire of conservatives who oppose gambling.
</P>
<P>
   And he can tell minority communities that favor charter schools
that he fought their fight, only to be thwarted by the Assembly's
top Democrats, though the Republicans who control the Senate were
in no hurry to go down that road, either.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it was a year made for political posturing, and not
just because of the coming election. In years past, lawmakers often
hitched smaller issues to larger ones, giving them leverage to get
more things done.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, for the first time since Pataki was elected in
1994, there were no momentous issues hanging over the lawmakers'
heads, no budget crisis, no plan for deep cuts, no rent controls
ready to expire, no deadline for welfare reform. As legislators
noted repeatedly all year, there was nothing that, for either side,
HAD to be done.
</P>
<P>
   In the final days of the session, there were a few notable
pieces of legislation passed, including one requiring that people
infected with HIV be reported to the state Health Department and
their sexual partners notified. Lawmakers also agreed on a program
of inspections and emissions-testing for heavy trucks and buses,
something long sought by environmentalists. And a deal was struck
on the management of the new Hudson River park in Manhattan that
places some limits on development along the river.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the Assembly Democrats, especially Speaker Sheldon Silver,
the session went much as it did for Pataki. They, too, calculated
that there was not much they needed, politically. They, too,
entered the year with a limited agenda, and in defeat found
election-year ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's broad budget vetoes in April denied the Democrats much
of what they wanted, including a $500 million increase in spending
on school construction and a tripling of spending on child care.
Silver refused to negotiate with Pataki and Senate Majority Leader
Joseph Bruno on restoring some of the vetoed items, saying it was
all or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the speaker made it clear that he would rather
have the issue to use against Pataki than have a fraction of the
money back. And as the session ended, Silver kept up his attacks on
the governor with an eye toward the November election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think that the people of this state will recognize
that while Wall Street is booming, Main Street is not booming in
New York,'' he said. ``The governor chose to veto some very sound
proposals that were passed through legislators of both parties.''
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly Democrats called for steps to reduce New York's
auto insurance rates, knowing well that the Republicans would
reject them. Again, even before the session had ended, the defeat
had become a campaign issue, as the Democrats running against the
governor piggy-backed on the Assembly's plans and blamed Pataki for
high premiums.
</P>
<P>
   It was telling that when asked what he considered the major
achievement of the session, Silver cited not a piece of
legislation, but a process: the negotiation of a budget through
public conference committees with the Senate, rather than in
private talks.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat obscured by the furor over the vetoes was the
Democrats' achievement of some of the things they wanted most this
year, including a large increase in basic school aid, expansion of
the state's health care program for poor children, and a process
for people to appeal when their health insurance companies deny
coverage for certain treatments.
</P>
<P>
   And in other areas, they may have inoculated themselves against
attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly passed a criminal-justice package that included the
governor's proposal to end parole, though it also included other
measures that Pataki and the Senate refused to accept. In the end,
no law was enacted, but the Democrats can go home and tell voters
that they, too, voted to abolish parole.
</P>
<P>
   So attractive was that measure as a piece of political cover
that all the Republicans in the Assembly voted for it as well, for
fear that they would be accused of opposing the anti-parole
measure.
</P>
<P>
   In the final week, Silver offered to work out a compromise in
conference committees, a proposal the Republicans rejected. Of the
governor, he said, ``He believes he has it better as a campaign
issue than as a law, that it suits his purposes.''

THERESA MERRITT, 75, PRAISED IN ROLE OF MA RAINEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Va., Pa.)   (bl)  
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Theresa Merritt, whose half-century career on
television, in movies, on Broadway and in concert halls stretched
from the original production of ``Carmen Jones'' to a recent
episode of ``NYPD Blue,'' died June 12 at Calvary Hospital in the
Bronx. She was 75 and lived in the Hollis section of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for her family said Ms. Merritt died after a
six-year battle with skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Merritt is probably best known for two roles. Beginning in
1974, she starred in ``That's My Mama,'' an ABC situation comedy
set in a Washington barbershop where a widowed mother knows best
what her hapless son (played by Clifton Davis) should do.
</P>
<P>
   And on Broadway in 1984 she originated the title role of a
domineering, manipulative blues singer in August Wilson's ``Ma
Rainey's Black Bottom,'' earning a Tony nomination.
</P>
<P>
   She was ``Ma Rainey incarnate,'' wrote Frank Rich in his review
in The New York Times. ``A singing actress of both wit and power,
she finds bitter humor in the character's distorted sense of self:
when she barks her outrageous demands to her lackeys, we see a show
business monster who's come a long way from her roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Merritt was born in Emporia, Va., but moved to Philadelphia
while a toddler to be reared by an aunt and uncle after her mother
died. Yearning for a career as an opera singer, she studied at the
Settlement School of Music in Philadelphia, and at Temple
University and New York University.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, she sang in church and community choirs and
appeared on a radio show aimed at black audiences, ``Parisian
Tailor's Colored Kiddie Hour.''
</P>
<P>
   When she was 21, Ms. Merritt was chosen by Billy Rose, the
Broadway producer, to join the cast of his 1943 musical, ``Carmen
Jones.'' She played Frascetta.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Ms. Merritt toured as a backup singer for Harry Belafonte
and Jackie Wilson and sang at Carnegie Hall in 1985 as part of the
Kool Jazz Festival and Salute to Cole Porter.
</P>
<P>
   Her other New York stage roles included a gospel singer in
``Trumpets of the Lord'' in 1969; the understanding Southern maid
in ``F. Jasmine Addams,'' a 1971 musical based on Carson McCullers'
``Member of the Wedding''; the wicked witch in ``The Wiz,'' and
John Lithgow's black Polish landlady in ``Division Street,'' a 1980
farce by Steve Tesich.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Merritt acted in several films, including ``They Might Be
Giants'' (1972), ``The Goodbye Girl'' (1977), ``All That Jazz''
(1979), ``The Great Santini'' (1979), ``The Best Little Whorehouse
in Texas'' (1982) and ``The Serpent and the Rainbow'' (1988).
</P>
<P>
   She also appeared on numerous television series, including
``Beekman Place,'' ``Another World,'' ``Police Story'' and ``The
Love Boat.'' In the last year, she played guest roles on ``NYPD
Blue,'' ``Cosby'' and ``Law and Order.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Merritt is survived by her husband of 52 years, Benjamin
Hines, and by four children, Norman, Benjamin Jr. and Denise, all
of Hollis, and Dennis, of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1984 interview, following her acclaimed opening in ``Ma
Rainey's Black Bottom,'' Ms. Merritt said: ``I don't regret never
being a big star. That can all go in seconds. I'm 62, and I've had
a taste of it all.''

NYC STEPS UP TRANSFER OF HOMELESS AID TO PRIVATE SECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The city agency that has provided shelter and other
services to tens of thousands of homeless New Yorkers is entering
an era of sharp retrenchment as the Giuliani administration
intensifies its efforts to take the city out of the business of
running shelters.
</P>
<P>
   In the spending plan that begins July 1, the Giuliani
administration will cut 1,000 positions from the Department of
Homeless Services _ roughly half of its staff _ over a year. The
changes are part of a broader effort to hand over the task of
running the city's homeless services to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   And in about three weeks, the city intends to officially stop
using so-called welfare hotels as long-term shelters for homeless
families. This change will end an ambitious effort, begun almost
two decades ago, to shelter all who knocked at the municipal door.
Much larger hotels once bulged with hundreds of poor people and
came to symbolize all that was wrong with the nation's policy on
housing the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The city will also hand over five more shelters to the private
sector, reducing the number of shelters that it operates to 10 from
15. By the end of the next fiscal year it will run four shelters
for single adults and six for families. It used to operate most of
its 44 shelters for single adults. Most of its 80 shelters for
families have already been turned over to private nonprofit
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in homeless services to private hands could be the
turning point in negotiations over whether to keep the
five-year-old Department of Homeless Services. The agency, which
comes up for renewal every three years, is scheduled to dissolve
June 30 if an agreement cannot be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and City Council Speaker Peter
Vallone support measures to make the agency permanent, but they
disagree on several issues, including the cutbacks at the agency
and conditions at the Emergency Assistance Unit, the office in the
Bronx where homeless families are screened and referred to
shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen DiBrienza, a Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the
Council's general welfare committee, which oversees the agency,
says he is concerned that reducing the agency's staff will rob the
homeless of essential services. Among the employees to be
eliminated are case management workers who counsel and nurse
families in the hotels. The other positions include workers who
serve food and do the dishes and laundry. The city plans to offer
those jobs to private agencies, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Campbell, the commissioner of the Department of Homeless
Services, said that in about three weeks, the city will no longer
use the hotels to house families beyond the 10 days that it takes
officials to determine whether a family has absolutely no place to
go besides a shelter. That change will diminish the need for the
case management workers at the hotels, he said. In 1993, the city
had contracts with 22 such hotels, and now it has 10, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under city law, New York is allowed to put homeless families in
commercial hotels for up to 60 days while they seek permanent
housing. For stays beyond 60 days, the law requires that the hotels
be no larger than 100 units and have kitchens in each unit. Since
December 1996, the city has not used hotels that do not comply,
Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, DiBrienza was working on a compromise that he planned to
submit to his committee for a vote Monday and to the full Council
on Wednesday. If the Council moves forward on a bill without a nod
from the administration, the measure could languish in
administrative limbo for months, resulting in the dissolution of
the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Homeless Services has been given high marks by
homeless advocates for improving services for poor people and
finding permanent housing for the homeless. But even supporters
have criticized the agency's tough eligibility standards and its
use of hotels and the Emergency Assistance Unit to provide
emergency shelter for homeless families.
</P>
<P>
   The Emergency Assistance Unit was never intended to provide
temporary shelter, but for years families have stayed there for
more than one night while waiting to be placed in other quarters,
becoming the focal point of a long-running court battle between the
city and homeless advocates. As a condition of making the agency
permanent, DiBrienza has insisted that the unit be equipped with
cots and cribs for families waiting to be placed.
</P>
<P>
   But Campbell said that over the past eight months, the agency
has been able to place families in shelters within 20 hours and
therefore has no need for cots and cribs.
</P>
<P>
   But, DiBrienza said, ``whether people are there for five hours
or eight hours, they should have a bed, cot or a crib.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Banks, a lawyer for the Legal Aid Society's Homeless
Family Rights Project, called the Emergency Assistance Unit a de
facto barracks-style shelter for children and their families.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of a handful of advocates who argue the Department of
Homeless Services, created with workers from the city's Human
Resources Administration, should be dismantled, saying it has
failed in its mission to move people out of the system and into
permanent housing.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has placed more then 19,000 families and 4,000 single
adults into subsidized housing since 1994, officials said. But
advocates say the city can do more.
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 families, including about 7,000 children, and about
7,000 single adults stay in shelters in the city on any given
night, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders also give the agency low marks, saying they never
supported its creation because they knew it would mean a loss of
jobs for city employees. In 1994, the agency had 3,000 workers; now
it it has 2,170. In addition, the Giuliani administration plans cut
the agency's budget by $20 million to $370 million.
</P>
<P>
   The city has been contracting with nonprofit groups to take over
shelters and services for the homeless since the 1980s.

 &HT;    BEHIND THE TV IMAGE OF CLINTON'S CHINA TRIP ARE MONTHS OF
PLANNING, AND HEADACHES
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Red paper lanterns, gongs, drums and a cast of
hundreds decked out as Tang Dynasty warriors will await President
Clinton this Thursday when he arrives at the ancient Silk Road city
of Xian to kick off a nine-day tour of China.
</P>
<P>
   The imperial-style welcome will wind up a much longer journey,
however, for legions of U.S. officials who have been toiling since
last winter to choreograph and coordinate every imaginable detail
of a state visit that will take the president through 3,500 years
of Chinese history and leave him peering far into the nation's
future.
</P>
<P>
   For behind the scenes at each leg of Clinton's five-city tour
lie countless strategy meetings, site inspections, event
consultations and back-room skull sessions . It's all the work of a
temporal team of White House schedulers, diplomats, security
agents, communications experts, transportation specialists,
physicians and even chefs who have come together in recent months
to plan the presidential trip to China.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to factor in time on the president's schedule,
security, press access, the message and what you want to highlight,
the logistics of the cars'' and similar concerns for each separate
event, explained a White House official who has worked closely on
the upcoming China trip. ''Then you have to feed it all into a meat
grinder.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, for instance, eye-popping logistical matters to be
worked out, starting with the basic question of just how should the
Leader of the Free World travel, and how long must he be away from
the office?
</P>
<P>
   Answer to both: take your own jumbo jet and bring the office
along in the form of Air Force One, the president's personal magic
carpet. It's a specially modified Boeing 747-200 that, for $35,300
an hour - not including the crew of 26 - can move the essential
functions of the White House from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to
virtually anywhere else on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   In case it breaks down, a second, similar plane will shadow Air
Force One on the trip as a standby.
</P>
<P>
   In the event the president hits a rough patch, he'll have his
own physician with him, as well as a complete emergency room's
worth of medical gear and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The president will take along his own car, too - an armored
black limousine that flies ahead in its own Air Force cargo jet,
along with a pair of sport utility vehicles used by the U.S. Secret
Service agents who protect the president. He will also take his own
private telephone company - banks of switching and transmission
gear must be transported and set up days ahead of time for each
stop he'll make - so that the president can talk with international
leaders or key U.S. officials anywhere around the world without
worrying that someone else might be listening.
</P>
<P>
   Good help can be hard to find overseas, so the president will
also take along enough personnel to staff a good-sized corporation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to hundreds of presidential assistants, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, Secretary of Treasury Robert Rubin and
National Security Adviser Samuel Berger will be along with key
members of their staffs in tow.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of other administration officials with expertise in
everything from trade and environmental matters to arms control and
international law will also be along on the trip, many of them
traveling separately aboard smaller Air Force transport craft.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't yet clear how large the presidential entourage to China
will be, but some 800 people went along with him to Africa last
spring, in addition to 200 journalists and media technicians.
</P>
<P>
   The China entourage is expected to be somewhat smaller - though
the press contingent will be twice as large as it was in Africa -
largely because many of the American corporations that sent
executives on the Africa trip have representative offices in China.
</P>
<P>
   Secret Service protection is, of course, secret, though agents
sometimes take very public steps aimed at deterring would-be
assailants by showing the presence of a large and comprehensive
security effort.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton visited the crime-ridden city of Cape
Town in South Africa last March, for instance, local security
agents, working hand-in-glove with the U.S. Secret Service,
canvassed the city welding shut manhole covers along possible
routes of the presidential motorcade, closing off a possible avenue
of attack and also sending out the message that a tight security
net had been cast across the seaside city.
</P>
<P>
   Secret Service agents typically inspect the sites of
presidential visits weeks in advance, often using a video camera to
record every place and path on the presidential journey. Then they
scrutinize the tape to make sure that every building air duct, door
or hallway has been secured against possible assassins or bombers.
</P>
<P>
   Being there, however, is only step one .
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, a presidential trip is global theatre, scripted,
directed and managed to convey American priorities, as identified
by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hopes to use the China trip, for instance, to try to
redefine American impressions and to show that his policy of
engaging with China economically, politically and diplomatically,
is helping to foster change.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that as a result of the trip, the American people will
learn more about China,'' Clinton said Friday. China is changing,
he said, but ''if you never get any kind of constructive
information, it's hard to know.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, one of the first things Clinton plans to do
in China is to visit a small village named Xia He, characteristic
of hundreds of thousands of rural hamlets across the vast country
that are struggling to shift away from the old ways of a state-run
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Largely by shifting to market-based economic practices, in
concert with opening up to foreign investment, tourism and trade,
China has seen perhaps half a billion of its people rise from the
depths of hardscrabble poverty over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   By stitching together brilliant Tang-dynasty era caps of
imperial yellow or red for sale to tourists who flock to the Terra
-cotta Warriors Museum nearby, Xia He resident He Jong Jie now
takes in the local equivalent of about $120 a month, many times
more than she used to earn in what she calls ''that smelly
farming'' that once provided sustenance for her and her family.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their lives have changed for the better,'' said a White House
official who's done much of the advance work for Clinton's trip.
''Obviously that's something that we're going to want to highlight,
as will the Chinese government.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also hopes to underscore China's long history of unity
and achievement, while, at the same time, spotlighting its vast
potential for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Those themes will underpin his planned visit to the Great Wall,
built 2200 years ago to keep out invaders from the north.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now the world is open. Every country is open to each other and
the world is like one large community. It's hard to imagine that a
certain country would build a wall to isolate itself from the rest
of the world,'' explained a senior Chinese official. ''The lesson
of the last one and a half centuries is that China totally closed
itself against the introduction of new ideas from outsiders. That's
why Deng Xiaoping (who died last year after leading China for two
decades) introduced the opening to the outside world in 1978.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the dozens of sites he plans to visit - the terra-cotta
warriors near Xian, the Forbidden City in Beijing, the stock
exchange in Shanghai - there are dozens more his advance team
considered, surveyed and later rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Some presented security nightmares, others involved too much
time or simply didn't fit the story line.
</P>
<P>
   Despite months of planning, it's impossible to fully control a
nine-day tour through the world's most populous country. The best
laid plans, indeed, can go awry.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton opened his Africa tour in March with a stop in
Ghana, for instance, a crowd estimated at some quarter of a million
people turned out to listen to him speak. At one point, the crowd
surged forward, dangerously pinning two women against a fence. Film
footage of Clinton's panic-stricken cries for people to move back
dominated television coverage of the day's events, to the
consternation of White House spin doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, moreover, can't control everything about a
presidential trip.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Chinese authorities, the White House claims, who have
insisted that Clinton be received by President Jiang Zemin in front
of the Great Hall of the People, which borders Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of Clinton reviewing troops of the People's Liberation
Army beside the seat of a democracy movement the PLA brutally
crushed in 1989 is hardly the sort of image the White House message
shop might dream up. The timing of the event, however - 10 p.m.
Friday Eastern time - has the earmarks of an attentive advance
team.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're going to beat up on us for going (to Tiananmen
Square),'' said one White House official, ''at least give us credit
for doing it in the middle of the night.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like pilgrims at a sacred site, Dot Garabrant and her
friend Sadie Ciganeck stood outside the Lower East Side Tenement
Museum on Orchard Street, pointing to a collage of old-time
pictures of women in long dresses and fancy hats. The two had just
finished reading a novel about old New York _ something about a
woman who hailed from a line of healers. They had read the book.
Now it was time to do the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to come back and see how the old immigrants lived,''
said Ms. Garabrant, who grew up in Brooklyn. ``We're so used to
ripping down and putting up new things. My daughter-in-law is from
Germany and she laughs. We think 100 years is old. In Germany, it
has to be a thousand years.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything comes faster here, even milestones.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred years after what was most likely an ordinary day in
the newly consolidated city, New York is marking its birthday this
weekend with scores of events across town. Unlike the big bashes of
past years _ the Bicentennial with its flotilla of elegant tall
ships, or the Statue of Liberty's century celebration with its
dazzling and deafening blast of fireworks in the harbor _ this
birthday was low-key and spread out.
</P>
<P>
   Diffuse by design or default, perhaps its sheer variety was a
nod to the kaleidoscope of cultures and customs that have found a
home in New York. Hondurans rocked the Bronx with pop music while
traditional Korean dancers flashed their footwork in Flushing.
Walking tours explored history on the hoof. Swimmers dove into the
water by the George Washington Bridge for a race down the Hudson.
``Stay away from the sewage plant, it can suck you in,'' an
official warned the racers. ``Nobody swim to New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani _ defender from assaults West of the
Hudson _ would have liked that. He used his radio show to urge
tourists and natives alike to sample the weekend's events. ``We
always have a lot of problems that we have to work on together, but
we have a tremendous amount to celebrate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The actual anniversary of the city's consolidation was on New
Year's Day, but organizers thought the summer's first weekend would
provide a natural opportunity to herald both history and warm
weather by piggybacking onto the many events that always take place
this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Salerno, the president of NYC 100, which has organized a
yearlong series of events to mark the consolidation of the five
boroughs into Greater New York, said this weekend's idea was to
promote local pride. And if the neighborhood groups brought the
cake, she said, her group would light the candles _ with a
simultaneous five-borough fireworks show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to make this Manhattan-centric,'' she said,
adding that ``what people remember most are the things that happen
in your neighborhood. This gives everybody in the community a
moment to shine.''
</P>
<P>
   Flicker was more like it in Mott Haven on Friday night, as a
dozen people lazed about a candlelit room in the Adverse Possession
Galley, in an abandoned Bronx building. New paintings by local
artists were on display, and a lanky singer strummed to a pleading
rendition of ``Just My Imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's theme had caught the fancy of Rafael Bueno, a
poet, philosopher and prime mover behind the gallery and its
adjacent community garden. Wearing tails and a ruffled shirt, he
was scruffily formal for a show at the gallery, an official
Centennial event. In the garden, he walked under a leafy canopy of
grape vines _ he wants to bottle the first Bronx vintage, he said.
He would also like to see the borough become to Latin Americans and
indigenous people what Harlem is for African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This theme for us is very important, because the Bronx did not
benefit from the union with New York City,'' said Bueno, who
belongs to a group of homesteaders fighting the city in court after
their eviction several months ago. ``We're using this as a chance
to reflect on the union and to see if we should continue being part
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Queens, history was on the march. So was science, home repair
and even Danielle Steel, as library workers carried boxes of books
from the old public library to the new Flushing branch Saturday
morning. Most people lining the eight-block parade route were
unaware of any real connection to the city's centennial. This was
just their chance to celebrate their own neighborhood, which
sometimes feels like a stepchild.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, New York gets the news 99 percent of the
time,'' said Even Li. ``Today, it's Flushing's turn.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood, like its library, has grown over the years,
and both reflect the rich mix of people who have come to call this
place home. The library collection includes items in 30 languages.
Videotapes and best-selling novels are the big favorites, although
Joanna Almeda said she thought of finding a book about how Queens
and Manhattan were united.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems the two belong together,'' she said. ``People can
learn about how the two combined for the first time. I think Queens
is part of New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not how some folks feel in Staten Island, where a
secessionist sentiment still smolders. Linda Gregori, 53, thinks
they never should have built the Verrazano Narrows Bridge, which
has joined her island to Brooklyn since 1964, never mind what
happened in 1898. It brought too much traffic, people and crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want no part of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens or the
Bronx,'' she said. ``An adopted redhead, that's what Staten Island
is to the city.''
</P>
<P>
   A century ago, that was the fear of Brooklynites who resisted
the city's consolidation amid fears that their bucolic town's charm
would vanish forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave it to Brooklyn to have that attitude,'' said Rene
Thompson as she sat in the sun in a grassy park between the
Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges. ``There's something good in all
five boroughs.''
</P>
<P>
   She had come early to the park to enjoy some peace and quiet.
The whir of cars zipping overhead on the bridges provided a lulling
comfort. She is also at ease with the idea that Brooklyn prospered
after joining the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did the right thing,'' she said. ``Hey, I'm here. Join the
party.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She planned to go to Manhattan later in the day to see what
birthday events she would run into. She had already celebrated in
her own way on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rode my bike over the bridge and went down to the ferry,''
she said. ``And then I'm in Staten Island. I rode back. And here I
am back in Brooklyn. You can walk or run into something this
weekend with the birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a parks worker watered a lawn with a view of spans and
skyscrapers. On a shaded cobblestone walk, a fashion photographer
clicked away at a model who kept a cool expression while wearing a
winter coat and scarf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for peace and quiet,'' Ms. Thompson said. ``You
find your niche and get in there. Just fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   Waves of weary and hopeful immigrants arrived in this city to do
just that. Dave Creary, whose mother brought him from Jamaica when
he was 6, was amazed at the variety of people who have settled in
the city.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, he was high on his neighborhood _ leaning
over a balcony at the Panorama of New York City, a scale model of
the five boroughs inside the Queens Museum. He was searching for
his Queens Village house, which was somewhere between Kennedy
Airport and the rows of identical homes. The city was laid out
before him: the cluster of red-brick buildings near the sands of
Coney Island, the tiny bridges stitching together the metropolis,
and the thicket of towers crammed into Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Like most New Yorkers, he had driven past the museum without
ever having gone inside. He was too busy working, until his uncle,
who was visiting from London, talked him into a day trip. Creary
looked at the model city, awed by its size. To him, however, urban
progress was measured not by soaring towers but by much smaller
details.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of years ago I had a street full of holes,'' he said.
``About two years ago, they finally repaired it. That's progress.''
</P>
<P>
   On Orchard Street, the restoration went back a bit further as
the road was paved with cobblestones. On Saturday morning, Larry
Shapiro and his wife, Patricia Sousa, turned the corner from Broome
Street hoping to see the other vintage sights on the Centennial
Block. But the gates of most stores were still down, and some would
not go up at all, since the Jewish shopkeepers would be observing
the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   ``We forgot,'' Ms. Sousa said. ``It's Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, they had come to the street to pay their respects to
tradition and heritage on the Lower East Side. The faces had
changed, but some things were the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everybody's family _ but a lot _ came over and were forced
to live down here,'' Shapiro said. ``I've been coming down here
since I was a kid. My parents used to drag me down here for a meal
at Katz's. And this street was the shopping district. You came down
here and you could buy everything half price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I ever had a pair of underwear that didn't come
from this area.''

NO BUDGING IN NBA NEGOTIATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Previously skedded as BKN-DRAFT)  
 (bl)  
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is still time for National Basketball
Association players to form a team and compete for the United
States in Athens, Greece, this summer, just as there is still time
for the players and owners to agree on a deal that would insure
labor peace before the current collective bargaining agreement
expires July 1.
</P>
<P>
   But given the stubborn climate of recent negotiations, neither
appears likely. Even with a meeting scheduled for Monday in
Manhattan, both sides appear headed toward a long, tense summer of
bargaining. With major monetary issues on the table, the league
faces the growing possibility of losing games to labor strife for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, you have to make a deal,'' said Russ Granik, the
league's deputy commissioner, who is heading the negotiations on
behalf of the owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only question is when and how much damage you do before
you get to that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hunter, the executive director of the players'
association, proposed last Wednesday that both sides agree to a
moratorium rather than the owners' locking out the players. A
lockout would prohibit any NBA business between players and teams,
meaning the free-agent signing period, set to begin July 1, would
be postponed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   But the owners will not accept any deal that allows more
contracts or trades to be signed and consummated under the current
rules. Barring major concessions, two league officials confirmed
Friday, a lockout is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Using the world championships in Athens as a platform, the 12
NBA players selected to the team have decided to boycott the games
until a labor agreement is reached. USA Basketball, the
organization that selects teams for international play, stoked the
fires last week, saying it would send another team to Athens.
</P>
<P>
   There is hope for Grant Hill, Gary Payton and friends to play
overseas. FIBA, which oversees international competition, has
privately intimated to USA Basketball that it would accommodate
last-minute replacements in order to field the best team possible.
It is a move that would clear the way for NBA players to decide to
compete shortly before the games begin on July 29.
</P>
<P>
   But while rosters and dates are negotiable, apparently the
players are not budging.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all probability, if there is a lockout, the players will be
inclined to vote not to go,'' Hunter said. ``Our guys are taking
the position that they'll keep an open mind. We're looking to see
what action the league will take July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it doesn't get ugly,'' he added. ``I will continue to
exercise whatever restraint and professionalism necessary. The hope
is that we can come to some agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a lawyer familiar with the negotiations, the owners
want to install a hard salary cap, essentially a fixed amount each
team can spend in a season, without exceptions. Over the next two
or three seasons, teams would also like to phase out the Larry Bird
exception, in which teams can pay their own free agents whatever
they want, regardless of the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   For the owners, the ultimate goal is to reduce player salaries
over a three-year period so that they do not exceed 48 to 50
percent of total revenues. They also would not mind limiting
individual salaries so that one or two players do not gobble up all
the money on a roster.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas the owners see their proposals as finally bringing some
economic balance to a league of $100 million-or-bust contracts, the
players view the approach as taking back what it is already theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not even on the same planet right now,'' said a union
official who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The perception among players is that commissioner David Stern is
wed to the idea that they will give in if they have to miss
paychecks. The players' resolve may indeed be tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've moved much closer together than when we
first started bargaining,'' Granik said. He added, ``It's probably
a long shot that we would reach a deal on a moratorium.''
</P>
<P>
   With less than two weeks left, time for agreement is running out
as the league and its players decide how to divvy up annual revenue
of more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fans of the NBA won't completely relate with
what's going on,'' said Allan Houston, the Knicks shooting guard
who is boycotting the world championships. ``But hopefully they'll
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Draft Variables
</P>
<P>
   This is what preparation for the NBA has come to: A guy who had
not played five-on-five basketball until two years ago may end up
going No. 1 in Wednesday's draft.
</P>
<P>
   Now hedging on whether they will select Arizona point guard Mike
Bibby with the first pick, the Los Angeles Clippers may decide to
take the University of Pacific's 7-foot-1-inch Nigerian phenom
Michael Olowokandi this week in Vancouver, British Columbia. The
club is said to be divided on which player it will choose, leaving
the door wide open for the first five or six selections.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver, which is said to be interested in taking the Kansas
forward Paul Pierce at No. 2, is still entertaining offers from
teams for its pick. The Denver Nuggets, who have the third pick,
are worried the Toronto Raptors will move up from No. 4 to No. 2 in
order to take Olowokandi or Bibby, thus forcing them to take Pierce
instead of the big man they covet.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas' Raef LaFrentz, North Carolina's Antawn Jamison, Vince
Carter and the St. Louis shooting guard Larry Hughes all figure to
be in the next group of players, along with Michigan's Robert
(Tractor) Traylor and Utah's Michael Doleac.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando and Houston control the middle of the draft. Through
trades and other deals, the Magic and Rockets have three picks
apiece between Nos. 12 through 18. The Magic has the 12th, 13th and
15th picks, while the Rockets have Nos. 14, 16 and 18. Minnesota
has the 17th selection.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks do not have a first-round pick, and the Nets have no
pick in either the first or second round. The Knicks have the 38th
and 44th picks in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Filling Out the Bulls
</P>
<P>
   With the season put on hold, so, too, is the future of the
Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Bulls Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf continues to express desire about
re-signing Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman to
prevent the franchise from falling into immediate decay.
</P>
<P>
   If Jordan can persuade Pippen to somehow overcome his long-held
resentment against management in the next few months or whenever
the owners and players settle their labor war, the possibility of a
reunion for one more season exists.
</P>
<P>
   But if Chicago loses Pippen and Rodman _ along with Coach Phil
Jackson, as expected _ look for General Manager Jerry Krause to
make some kind of push for the free agent Jayson Williams to fill
the rebounding void.
</P>
<P>
   If Chicago could not offer Williams the money the Nets can, it
would not be beyond the Bulls to sell their corporate culture to
Williams and give him reassurances that he will not retire a poor
man. What's more, Toni Kukoc has shown over the past few months
that he can pick up much of Pippen's offensive contributions.
</P>
<P>
   For Jordan to come back, he needs to be convinced he can still
compete for a title. If Pippen leaves, acquiring another All-Star
in Chicago is the only difference between the greatest player ever
staying for one or two more seasons or leaving the game again.

THE MORE JEFF GORDON WINS, THE MORE FANS JEER AND DRIVERS SNEER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (bl)  
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The title of top driver in the rough-edged world of stock car
racing has always carried with it an additional designation:
target.
</P>
<P>
   Win too often and there will be as many fans hating you as
loving you. There will be drivers who will not hesitate to run you
into a wall and others who might even cheat to keep you from
winning a race.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, in a sport where loyalty to individual drivers
possesses a certain cult quality, Dale Earnhardt has played the
role of champion and villain, as have Bill Elliott and Darrell
Waltrip.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon, who who is the pole-sitter for the Pocono 500 on
Sunday, is the latest driver to live out this weird dual existence
_ the best and the booed.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's accomplishments on the track _ two NASCAR championships
in the last three years, 32 career triumphs _ are unmatched. His
earnings are unrivaled. And so his detractors are legion. Not
surprisingly, then, his misfortunes also now tend to be colored by
intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Gordon was leading a race in Richmond when he was
crashed into from behind and was unable to finish the race, much to
the delight of the fans who stood and cheered wildly as Gordon's
smoking car skidded to a stop.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, he raced to a nearly insurmountable lead at the
Michigan Speedway when a driver tossed something out his window and
onto the track, forcing a caution and costing Gordon his lead and,
ultimately, the race.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a coincidence? Maybe. Is it the result of a design driven
by dislike or jealousy? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they just like to see me go backwards,'' Gordon said
of his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   About the incident last week in Michigan _ NASCAR began an
investigation of possible intentional foul play _ Gordon said, ``It
does make you wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is not unreasonable to wonder if anyone has ever felt
the sting of being a hated virtuoso more acutely than Gordon. In a
sport that began as recreation for moonshiners running liquor
across the South, Gordon stands out as unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's resume is not standard issue. He is a middle-class kid
from California who moved to Indiana as a teen-ager. He is 26 years
old and never really had to pay the dues that other drivers did
(Earnhardt didn't start driving on the NASCAR circuit until he was
28). He is glib and does not speak with an accent, whereas many of
the drivers have a Southern drawl. He has the face and personality
of a Boy Scout, rather than a roughneck.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps most important, Gordon has ascended to the top of
the racing world just as the sport has begun to expand its reach
and reap greater economic reward _ finding popularity among a
wider, wealthier population, acquiring an appeal as a marketing
engine for nontraditional sponsors and paying its champions
millions instead of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is the face of that expanding NASCAR universe. With a
wife who pins scripture verses to his dashboard, Gordon is the
sport's singular talent and greatest marketing vehicle. Last year
he made $6.5 million in endorsements, promoting, among other
things, milk and toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm still young and new to the sport,'' said Gordon,
who, with a victory Sunday, could reclaim the lead from Jeremy
Mayfield in the Winston Cup point standings. ``I've done things a
little different than a lot of other guys coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon began racing on Go-Kart tracks in Vallejo, Calif., when
he was 5 years old. He immediately showed exceptional ability and
an intense drive to win. When he was 13, Gordon's stepfather, John
Bickford, an auto-parts manufacturer, moved the family to Indiana,
where Gordon had the chance to race professionally as a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   After years of dominating the Indiana dirt tracks, at the
relatively young age of 21, Gordon made the jump to NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   For Gordon, who is credited with an otherworldly kind of
aggressive precision as a driver, the timing of his arrival was
perfect. He entered NASCAR as it was beginning to establish itself
as a mainstream sport. At the time, NASCAR was expanding its
schedule and its national television deal with major and cable
networks was relatively new. Also, several new race tracks were
being built.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance at NASCAR events leaped 60 percent from 1990 to 1995,
and its purses now can exceed $5 million for a single race.
NASCAR's marketing staff, too, has got much savvier about selling
the sport, a development that has led to the establishment of theme
restaurants and merchandising outlets in malls across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, riding the front of the sport's new wave, won eight
races in 1995, his second full year, and 10 more in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he became only the second driver to win the $1
million bonus awarded to any racer who wins three of NASCAR's most
prestigious events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff has gotten to where he is really fast,'' Bill France, the
president of NASCAR, said. ``Some of the fans have a problem with
the new kid on the block beating their heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   In defense of their heroes, Gordon's army of detractors has
mounted an array of assaults: anti-Jeff Gordon T-shirts and signs
that carry similar messages. Internet home pages such as NASCAR
Fans Against Jeff Gordon (there were 10 such home pages at last
count) carry caricatures and musings that run from the profane to
the absurd to the silly.
</P>
<P>
   While Gordon has his own sizable following _ he boasts a fan
club of more than 20,000 members _ there seem to be many more fans
who find satisfaction in rooting against him. Like the drivers,
they, too, are frustrated by Gordon's weekly dominance. And when he
was passed last week in Michigan, the fans roared as loudly as the
fans at Richmond after his wreck there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like him because he wins every week,'' said Steve
Wilson, a fan from Detroit who was at last week's race in Michigan.
``Because he is a fake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a pretty boy and he whines too much,'' said Chris
McCombe, another fan. ``I'm an Earnhardt fan because he is real.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Waltrip was a brash young driver who openly
challenged anyone to beat him. In the 1980s and early 1990s, it was
Earnhardt and Elliott's quick rise to prominence that led to
resentment. But however much people disliked their steady success,
the drivers were always considered authentic members of racing's
rowdy fraternity. And no one then was making the kind of money
Gordon is now: he has earned roughly $15 million in purses in his
career, slightly more than $1 million this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody likes a winner,'' said the veteran driver Rick Mast,
who first met Gordon when they were competing on the Busch Grand
National Series in the early 1990s. ``If you win a lot, it's the
thing to do. Boo the winner. It's happened to guys before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, there's just nothing wrong with the guy,'' Mast
added. ``I mean, I'm like everybody else. I'm sort of jealous. He
has had so much success at a young age. You get what you're dealt
in life. You can't change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said the boos are part of the high price of success. As,
too, are the tactics of the other drivers. Gordon, who stops short
of accusing other drivers of willfully trying to harm him or his
chances, does note that other drivers, even when it might be to
their advantage, almost never join him in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is going to help the guy who has the best shot at
winning,'' Gordon said. ``They are going to everything they can to
make sure they keep him from winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Gordon's quick rise to the top of the sport has
provoked a regular swirl of rumors around the garages, from the
outrageous to the comic: his tires are pressure-coated with a
microscopically ground titanium dust; his car uses rocket fuel; he
and NASCAR officials have conspired to script how the racing season
would unfold, with Gordon winning his third championship in
dramatic fashion in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said there is no credence to the rumors. But he can sort
of understand the ones about his car. For one thing, it is almost
always the fastest. Another is that his team was caught with
illegal hubs a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team talks about it and we laugh about it,'' Gordon said
of the rumors. ``You learn not to pay attention to it. You have to.
If I let everything about me get to me, I'd probably be in a nut
house.''
</P>
<P>
   If people don't like him because of his success, Gordon said, he
can live with that. If they don't like him because of who he is,
well, he will find a way to live with that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was phony, then I would be out here in my Wranglers
saying how much I love fishing and deer hunting,'' he said. ``I'm
just trying to be myself. And because of it, some fans out there
are not supportive of me. I'm saying: `Hey, fans, you've got a
choice. If you like what I stand for and the things that I do, then
support me. If you don't, I understand.' I know I'm not going to
get every fan out there in the stands to follow me.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the last three years, Gordon has had the sport's
other drivers following him _ often not even within striking
distance.

AS SUPERMARKET CLOSES, THE ELDERLY SCRAMBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ Kathleen Devigne moved here 15 years ago
from the Bronx, where her fear of crime had kept her close to home.
In this bustling downtown of wide sidewalks and plentiful shops,
she found an ideal blend of city convenience and suburban peace of
mind.
</P>
<P>
   But now Mrs. Devigne, an 83-year-old widow who never learned to
drive, says she is facing a new threat to her independence: the
closing of the last neighborhood supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   The A&AMP;P, the only supermarket in downtown White Plains, where an
estimated 3,000 people over 65 live and shop, shut its doors at the
end of May. Company officials said the dingy, 15,000-square-foot
store on Main Street was not ``performing up to standard.''
</P>
<P>
   But to the store's customers, many of them elderly women like
Mrs. Devigne who do not drive and depend on stores within walking
distance, the store's closing meant the loss of one more bit of
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be a great place,'' said Mrs. Devigne, who moved
from the Fordham section of the Bronx to a federally subsidized
apartment building here at a friend's suggestion. ``I could walk to
everything I needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Mrs. Devigne (pronounced de-VEEN) broke two wrists in a
fall last year, she is healthy and now plans to walk a little
farther to shop at the Food Emporium a mile from her home.
</P>
<P>
   White Plains has long been a destination for many elderly Bronx
residents who wanted to live in what they considered to be a safer
place where driving a car was not a necessity, said White Plains
Planning Commissioner Michael Graessle. The city is the seat of
Westchester County government and home to two big malls, the
Westchester and the Galleria. Shoppers and workers make the city's
population swell to an average of 250,000 during the day, but
according to the 1990 census, only 48,718 people live in White
Plains. More than 20 percent, or 10,147, are 60 or older, and 3,139
are widowed, Graessle said.
</P>
<P>
   That percentage of people 60 or older compares with 16.8 percent
of the population nationally and 17.7 percent statewide.
</P>
<P>
   In downtown White Plains, the percentage of elderly residents is
even higher, with about 22 percent of the 11,392 residents 60 years
old or older.
</P>
<P>
   The A&AMP;P's closing has led some elderly White Plains residents to
urge city officials to lure another supermarket to buy the space.
</P>
<P>
   The A&AMP;P has put its building up for sale, though store officials
declined to reveal the asking price. George Gretsas, the executive
officer of White Plains, said that the asking price was $4 million,
far more than the $1.5 million that the city's assessors had
estimated the building was worth and too inflated a price for
another supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Before the A&AMP;P closed, a CVS drug store, a Woolworth's, a bank
and a couple of delicatessens, all within four blocks of one
another, had closed during the past year. Macy's led off the
downtown's decline two years ago, when it shut its Main Street
store after 47 years and moved into the nearby Galleria Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the stores closed to make way for a 24-screen movie
theater and retail complex that is supposed to be the centerpiece
of a plan to revitalize downtown White Plains. That complex does
not include a supermarket, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``White Plains is a disgrace,'' said Adeline Moritz, 87, her
voice rising with anger. ``We used to have Waldbaum's and Finast,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and store owners have scrambled to insure that no
one is left without access to food. The A&AMP;P began a free shuttle
bus from its closed store to the Food Emporium, which it also owns,
twice a week from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., said Andrew Carrano, A&AMP;P's
vice president for marketing and corporate affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Stop and Shop, another supermarket, is running a
shuttle twice a week along North Broadway, White Plains' leafy
version of the Grand Concourse. It takes customers to the store in
North White Plains, where the bus will wait for an hour before the
return trip, Mayor Joseph Delfino said in a letter he sent to 3,500
residents of the downtown neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a solution for everyone. ``I can't take a bus,'' said
Shirley Singer, 77, a retired insurance collector who moved from
the Bronx to Yonkers to White Plains and was widowed five years
ago. ``I have torn cartilage in my knee. I can't make the step. My
daughter lives in Peekskill and she said she'll shop for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Mrs. Singer said she thinks she might have to move again. In
the weeks since the A&AMP;P has closed, a friend has taken her shopping
once and canceled one planned shopping trip, (``I was all dressed
and waiting,'' Mrs. Singer said). Her daughter has helped, too, but
Mrs. Singer is considering moving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my daughter to come down every week to shop for
me _ it's imposing.'' she said. ``If it's going to be too much for
her, I'll give up my apartment and find a senior citizens'
residence and move.''

AT FUNERAL, FOND JOKES OF A MYSTERIOUS FIGURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By VIVIAN S. TOY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Larry Douglas, if that really was his name, had been
a fixture in local politics for years. But at his funeral last
week, only about two dozen people showed up to pay their respects.
And some of them joked that they went just to make sure he was
really dead.
</P>
<P>
   Not out of malice, but because Douglas had a penchant for
telling tall tales, especially of the political sort. While he had
developed a reputation as a brilliant political consultant in the
1980s, he also became widely known as someone who had a lot of
trouble sticking to the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything from the beginning of his career right through his
death was controversial,'' said George Arzt, a political
consultant. ``His life would be worthy of a John le Carre book, if
you could figure it all out.''
</P>
<P>
   He had been involved in mayoral and presidential elections and
was described by friends as an eloquent and well-connected
political analyst. But he also had a habit of disappearing for
years at a time _ once, his friends said, he fled to Israel to
avoid federal tax-evasion charges.
</P>
<P>
   When he died on June 12 at Coney Island Hospital, he had been
living under an assumed name, Zachary Phillips, in a tiny apartment
in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, for nearly two years. Most of the
people he had clinked glasses with at political gatherings and
plotted campaign strategies with did not even know he was in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Fisher, a city councilman from Brooklyn, who helped
identify Douglas' body at the funeral home last week, said Douglas
apparently had not worked at all in the last two years and died in
poverty. He said the mourners at Douglas' funeral _ a variety of
politicians, political consultants and reporters _ took up a
collection to help pay for the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking, there were probably more jokes told at a
funeral than you would have thought appropriate,'' Fisher said.
``But Larry was that kind of guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, who said Douglas had been living with a girlfriend named
Alice in Brighton Beach, said Douglas made up the name Zachary
Phillips because he wanted to live in anonymity. But other
acquaintances at the funeral said they believed that although the
name was purely concocted, Phillips was his real last name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody said he was brilliant, and he had a statistical
understanding of where votes came from that was nothing short of
remarkable,'' Fisher said. But he would also lie about campaigns
that he had worked on and claim to be close to congressmen and
senators who at best had met him among thousands of others at a
political dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when he said he had Thanksgiving dinner with the mayor of
Chicago every year and that he was friends with Richard Gere,
nobody knew what to believe,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas ran Fisher's first campaign for City Council in 1991. He
coordinated hundreds of volunteers for Mayor Edward Koch's 1981
re-election campaign and Mayor David Dinkins' campaign in 1989. He
also helped run Vice President Al Gore's 1988 bid for the
Democratic presidential nomination. He advised dozens of
congressional, judicial and City Council campaigns into the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But people in political circles had started to question his
credibility as early as 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was good at what he did, but he would also tell these
totally fantastical stories,'' said Jerry Skurnick, who helped run
Koch's campaign in 1981. For example, to cover for the fact that he
was working strictly as a volunteer for the Koch campaign, he told
people that the Koch campaign was paying him under the table and
that he had a paid position on Jim Florio's gubernatorial campaign
in New Jersey. Neither assertion was true.
</P>
<P>
   He also was an engaging man who friends said could spin a yarn
like nobody else. Skurnick said that a congressional candidate that
he worked with in 1986 said he found Douglas so entertaining that
``one day he was walking with him and they entered Central Park at
59th Street and the conversation was so engrossing that he didn't
notice how long they had been talking until they were at 110th
Street.''
</P>
<P>
   A former colleague of Douglas' who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said that his private life was also legend. ``He
apparently was usually juggling two or three paramours at time,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lynch, Dinkins' campaign manager, said: ``He vanished a lot
over the last 10 years. I think all the tales that he told had
caught up with him and in some quarters he had become persona non
grata.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fisher said that at Douglas' funeral, one thing was clear.
``Even people he had disappointed over the years still thought he
was fun to be with,'' he said.

COUPLE CHARGED IN 1984 MURDER OF WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A young woman whose body was found floating in the
East River 14 years ago is believed to have been killed by a couple
who were angered when she refused to work for them as a prostitute,
police said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, Arthur and Donna Kinlaw, were charged on Friday with
the murder of the woman, who was never identified, police said. Lt.
Steven Boldis, commanding officer of the Bronx Cold Case Squad,
said the Kinlaws ran a prostitution ring in the Hunts Point section
of the Bronx until fleeing New York more than a decade ago, when he
said they set out on a life of robbery, prostitution, burglary,
forgery and welfare fraud that spanned seven states. They were
arrested while in jail in El Centro, Calif., where they were
serving an eight-month sentence for welfare fraud, Boldis said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was discovered in the East River off Hunts Point on
May 3, 1984. Police said that when she was pulled from the water,
the short, black-haired woman was wearing a ripped blouse and blue
jeans, and appeared to have been bludgeoned and suffocated. Her
hands had been tied behind her back with scraps from her blouse,
and other sections were found stuffed down her throat, said Sgt.
Nick Vreeland, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   There were few clues, and the case was soon closed. But in
April, welfare fraud investigators in California told investigators
in New York that a woman whose name was being used as an alias by
Mrs. Kinslaw said she had information about a murder, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The informer said that the dead woman's first name was Linda,
that she was likely of Italian-American origin and may have lived
with her grandmother in either Brentwood or Bay Shore on Long
Island, police said. Detectives narrowed down the possible victims
to the body found in the East River in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   With that statement and other evidence later gleaned by
detectives, the police concluded that Kinlaw, 46, and his
39-year-old wife met the woman at a club called Blackberry Jam in
Bay Shore sometime in 1984. There, the Kinlaws, who have nine
children from their 20-year marriage, apparently befriended the
woman and then tried to convince her to become a prostitute in the
Hunts Point area, police said. They added that the couple had been
known in the area as running a prostitution ring at the time.
</P>
<P>
   After several days of resisting their offer, the woman
threatened to go to police, according to detectives. The couple
then beat and suffocated her, later taking her body to Hunts Point
and dumping it in the river, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been running ever since,'' Boldis said. ``They just
kept moving across the states, taking arrests for prostitution,
DWI, welfare fraud, then moving some more, always keeping their
kids in tow like a traveling band.''

WIMBLEDON MATCHES THE VETERAN AND THE BRASH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Uneasy lies the head that doesn't wear this
crown: from crass teen-agers to cranky veterans, everybody's
clamoring to be the queen of Wimbledon this year.
</P>
<P>
   According to no less an authority on women's tennis than the
six-time Wimbledon champion Billie Jean King, the last time the
game was so glutted with talent, and with novel personalities
hungering for glory, was never. ``Women's tennis is in the best
shape in its history, without question,'' said King, currently an
HBO commentator.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing a tradition that began, to some degree, here at
Wimbledon when the 15-year-old Lottie Dodd won the title in 1887,
women's tennis has become the proving ground of a bevy of teen-age
celebrities. Each of them is intent on looking and playing like no
one else in the world, especially their precursors, and each of
them is already famous regardless of whether she has actually won a
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex appeal does not win matches,'' observed the nine-time
Wimbledon champion, Martina Navratilova, of 17-year-old Anna
Kournikova, who reached the semifinals here last year. ``I don't
have a problem with her marketing; what I do have a problem with is
being cocky and arrogant when you've not won a damn thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The undisputed monarch of the bunch is a 17-year-old Swiss girl
who just recently began falling for boys instead of horses. Will
Martina Hingis put business before pleasure and defend in 1998 the
second of the three Grand Slam titles she monopolized in 1997?
There are 127 others, including five of Hingis' teen-age
compatriots among the top 30 players in the world, hoping she
won't.
</P>
<P>
   Even Hingis' fellow teen-agers agree that her tennis is more
sophisticated than theirs; that's why beating her has become just
as momentous a rite of passage as beating a legend like Steffi
Graf. That's why Kournikova, who has beaten Hingis and Graf this
season, announced that she is heading into Wimbledon feeling ``very
confident'' and more than a little interested in winning her first
career title at the All England Club.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hingis admits she fears being beaten by her
understudies far more than she frets about facing her elders, Graf
is one veteran whose designs on the 1998 Wimbledon title are all
the more passionate because she recognizes that this could be her
last campaign on these lawns. Also, Graf is the only player,
veteran or not, to own a 5-1 record against Hingis that includes
two victories at this Grand Slam event. If Hingis and Graf, a
seven-time champion, weather the seven-round collision course, they
would meet in the final.
</P>
<P>
   It would not exactly be a clash of innocence and experience.
These days tennis breeds millionaires, not innocents. More
intriguingly, it would be a clash of now meets then, of Hingis'
slick all-court calculations against Graf's stubborn baseline
power.
</P>
<P>
   Graf, the 29-year-old German who was ousted from her perch atop
the ranking 15 months ago by Hingis, has accumulated nearly as many
surgeries as Grand Slam titles _ she holds 21 _ but she refuses to
surrender her sport to the youngsters. This spring Graf swore she
would retire if she encountered one more physical setback. Instead,
straight from cursing out every official who worked the lines
during her petulant loss to Kournikova at Eastbourne on Wednesday,
she is here, steeling herself to outlast the competition and seeded
fourth _ on the strength of her past laurels _ despite an actual
rank of 91st.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I'm going to win,'' said Graf, who made a
spiritual pilgrimage to Center Court two weeks ago to reconnect
herself to the only place where she feels ``big joy'' whenever she
plays. ``I'm just going to let it happen.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another Grand Slam champion on the rebound is Monica Seles, the
24-year-old Yugoslav-turned-Floridian who made a rousing sprint to
the French Open final. That Seles counts no Wimbledon titles among
her collection of nine Grand Slam victories makes her bid almost as
urgent, and equally sentimental, as Graf's.
</P>
<P>
   Sentiment aside, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain, the French
Open champion and two-time Wimbledon finalist, wants to prove the
old guard is not going to be put out to pasture. ``Results say
everything,'' she said. ``Now that I won the French, maybe they'll
have more respect.''
</P>
<P>
   These are two outspoken generations of women's tennis merging
just in time for Wimbledon. With the possible exception of Venus
and Serena Williams, siblings who have already announced a dual
plot to dethrone the Swiss incumbent, the sisters who belong to
this sorority are anything but sweet and sisterly toward one
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've all grown up watching Steffi and me, and they've
raised their games to another level,'' Seles said. ``I think all of
them have strong determination, and I hope each one is going to be
the No. 1 at some point in their careers, but they're all pretty
ruthless for now.''
</P>
<P>
   Blithely self-aggrandizing is more like it, and that's making
for some scintillating feuds and rivalries, along with a potboiler
atmosphere: Hingis called Graf and her contemporaries a bunch of
past-their-prime players; Serena Williams slammed a ball at Sanchez
Vicario at Roland Garros and laughed it off; Kournikova has made it
clear that she doesn't just preen better than the rest, she wants
to play better, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 10 players who have what it takes to win this,''
said King, who split her group equally between veterans like
29-year-old Jana Novotna and ``the youngsters.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so long ago that Hingis was just a 14-year-old
Wimbledon wannabe who took one horrified look at the identity of
her first-round opponent in 1995, the top-ranked Graf, and decided
that maybe she didn't really want to go to Wimbledon after all.
Back then, Graf practically held the mortgage on Wimbledon and
every other Grand Slam. Not anymore. Hingis, a first-round victim
to the Graf in 1995, grew up and grew bold.
</P>
<P>
   And now nobody is intimidated by anybody and everybody is using
vengeance as a motivator. The old ones want to teach the young ones
a lesson, and the young ones want to vanquish the old ones. Every
player wants what Hingis has: the self-esteem that accompanies this
Wimbledon trophy.  &QL;

CHINA HINDERS OPERA PERFORMANCE IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Rebuffing international pressure to
compromise, Chinese authorities instead chose to escalate their
dispute with the director of a classic Chinese opera that is
scheduled to open in New York City next month as the centerpiece of
the Lincoln Center Festival.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute, which seems to be about power as much as about art,
now threatens to scuttle the Shanghai Kunqu Opera Company's
project, ``The Peony Pavilion,'' originally expected to open on
July 7.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Shanghai officials accused the opera's director,
Chen Shi-Zheng, of making his production ``feudal, absurd and
pornographic in a way that is unacceptable to Chinese viewers and
artists.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen countered that his interpretation of the opera, with
innovative and vivid staging, actually comes closer to the original
spirit intended when it was written by Tang Xianzu in 1598. Lincoln
Center hired Chen to direct ``The Peony Pavilion,'' in part,
because of his ambition to breathe new life into a genre that has
deteriorated in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities, insisting that the world see a version that
Chinese officials are used to, have required extensive revisions to
the opera's script. Last week, they blocked shipment of the
production's sets, props and costumes, now all stuck at Shanghai
International Airport. They defended that move by saying the items
will be needed as the opera is revised.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is emerging just days before the arrival of
President Clinton to China, a visit that officials from both
countries are touting as a symbol of cooperation. Yet diplomats
from the United States and France, where ``The Peony Pavilion'' is
also scheduled to be performed this year, have pleaded with
Shanghai leaders to intervene and solve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Burghardt, U.S. consul general in Shanghai, said he had
urged the Shanghai authorities to allow the production's shipment
to proceed to New York on Sunday, and expressed the hope that the
dispute could be resolved in time for the opening on July 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the dress rehearsal, and I thought it was terrific,''
Burghardt said. ``This is a very important example of U.S.-China
cultural cooperation. The Kunqu company was in dire financial
straits before Lincoln Center came along.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen, saying he was distressed by the thought that the
production might be foiled, stressed that he was willing to make
minor adjustments to his production in order to compromise with the
authorities. But he is not willing to completely restage the show,
as the officials are now demanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We signed a contract last year, approved by the Bureau of
Culture, that says I am artistic director and can stage the opera
according to my artistic vision,'' Chen said. ``These people don't
understand the meaning of a contract.''
</P>
<P>
   In principle, the Shanghai Bureau of Culture might have little
say over a production to be staged in the United States, and funded
by the Lincoln Center Festival.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, Communist Party bureaucrats have wielded decisive
control over artistic matters for years and are reluctant to give
it up. Many movie directors, authors and actors in China know about
interference by officials at the Ministry of Culture, still a
redoubt of ultraconservative officials.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, a native of China who moved to the United States in 1987,
said he was warned by friends that the typical method of staging a
show in China includes inviting political leaders to a rehearsal
and making whatever changes they ask for, large or small, even if
the politicians understand nothing of opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say I have no right to adapt it,'' Chen said. ``To me,
the point is to offer another artistic vision. They may not like
it; that is their right. But should they prevent us from performing
it at all?''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Down a cascade of steel steps in the half-basement
Chinese video store in Elmhurst, Queens, Shi Jiehua methodically
glued labels onto black plastic cases one recent afternoon as a
Chinese soap opera murmured on a small television.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, her husband, Cai Qingling, burst through the door,
joking, chatting, then pausing a moment before breaking into song _
a short, shivery aria from the 16th-century opera ``The Peony
Pavilion.''
</P>
<P>
   This shoe box of a store has become a gathering place for some
of the greatest Chinese opera stars _ part of a growing diaspora of
opera performers who have come to the United States from China,
often initially to perform, but then to stay.
</P>
<P>
   They come seeking freedom for themselves and opportunity for
their children. But unlike many artists from Western countries
whose celebrity follows them here, the performers from China find
themselves plunged into the austere world of new Chinese
immigrants, a world of menial jobs, Spartan housing and little
contact beyond the immigrant community.
</P>
<P>
   For many Chinese, the sight of Shi Jiehua shelving videotapes or
Cai Qingling delivering takeout food is akin to the notion of
Luciano Pavarotti scrubbing pots at a pasta joint in Little Italy.
But virtually no Chinese opera star in this country can survive on
performing and teaching alone.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the last 10 years, a network of opera societies,
workshops and private patrons has evolved in cities across the
United States, especially in New York. Amateur opera buffs can
study with master teachers. Legendary singers from Shanghai, here
at the invitation of local Chinese arts centers, spend afternoons
mingling with opera greats who have immigrated. One group scours
China for talented performers, trying to lure them to live in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some wealthy Chinese here, evoking the practice in the late Ming
Dynasty of having individual opera troupes attached to great
households, even sponsor stars from China to come and sing for them
and their friends in intimate gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, Anna Yip, a native of Hong Kong who has been in
the United States for decades, hired Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln
Center to stage three scenes from Beijing operas, performed by
opera stars living here and one flown in from Beijing _ as well as
by Mrs. Yip herself. ``I'm an opera nut,'' she said, adding, ``You
come to America and you start to get homesick.''
</P>
<P>
   When opera resumed in Shanghai in the late 1970s, after the
decadelong devastation of the Cultural Revolution, Cai and Ms. Shi
returned to the stage as two of the ``10 pillars'' of the city's
celebrated Kunqu Theater Troupe. But in 1988, while on a tour of
this country, they decided not to return to China.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague, Chen Zhiping, who has most recently worked in a
Chinese-owned garment factory and who also passes time at the
Elmhurst video store, followed a year later. ``People have a lot of
individual reasons for coming,'' explained Chen, who spent three
and a half years in prison during the political terror of the
Cultural Revolution. ``Children, marriage, political reasons.
Today, if I say I want a day off because I'm tired, I take a day
off. On the mainland, you can't do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the basic reason,'' he added, ``is we don't want our
children to be raised in that repressive atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Year after year, opera stars from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou
and dozens of other cities across China filter into the United
States, some through performing-artist visas, others through
defecting from visiting opera companies. So great is the influx of
talent that, unlike anywhere in China, New York regularly has
performances of China's four major opera traditions by stars of the
first magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 21 professional resident artists,'' said Anna Chen Wu,
the president of the Kunqu Society. ``But none of them are
full-time. Some don't even speak any English. Many of them work in
garment factories, restaurants, small jobs like that. But they are
some of the best opera musicians and singers in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Shi, 51, whose name was known in every Shanghai
household during the peak of her career, leaving China meant
forsaking fame and entering an unknown world. ``What did we know
about the U.S.?'' she said. ``When we came, there was almost no one
here. But we had to do this for our son. So what if we are not
famous here?''
</P>
<P>
   In Flushing, Queens, Agnes Ho and her husband, Steve, have
turned their red-brick house into a nerve center of Chinese opera.
A dining table is heaped with immigration documents for opera
singers, grant applications to federal and state arts agencies,
invitations to opera troupes in China. A basement walled in mirrors
serves as a practice room.
</P>
<P>
   From here, Mrs. Ho, 61, runs the Tung Ching Chinese Center for
the Arts, a nonprofit group that has sponsored more than 50 opera
stars to come to live in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these opera stars stay here because in China they neglect
culture,'' she said. ``We're trying to keep this alive. We devote
all our time to this.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ho, who emigrated from Hong Kong in 1968, said the effort
began almost by chance in 1984, when she and her husband met a
Chinese musician who had played the erhu _ a long-necked,
two-string instrument with a slightly nasal tone _ in opera
orchestras in China. ``He said he wanted to stay here,'' Mrs. Ho
said, ``so we helped him.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the brick house, Mrs. Ho and one of her boarders, a newly
arrived opera performer named Xie Dong, opened a shed filled with
costumes and props. Silk and satin robes, densely layered with gold
and silver embroidery, sat on shelves carefully labeled with the
names of individual operas. A steamer trunk overflowed with swords
in elaborate scabbards. Mrs. Ho bought the collection, which she
thinks may be the largest of its kind, with money she earned here
as an insurance agent.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a 40-member opera troupe from the northern Chinese
city of Shenyang went to Berkeley, Calif., to perform. Three of the
leading performers, all award winners in China, fled the troupe and
sought help from Mrs. Ho. All three now live in Queens, around the
corner from the Hos' house.
</P>
<P>
   Not far away, on two Saturdays each month, the annex of St.
George's Episcopal church in Flushing echoes with the wail of the
kundi, the bamboo flute that is at the center of kunqu (pronounced
KUN-CHEW) opera. Slumped in a leather armchair one recent Saturday,
Chen waited for his students at the Kunqu Society workshop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to the United States in 1989, just when Tiananmen took
place,'' he explained, referring to the Chinese Army's killing of
pro-democracy protesters around Beijing's Tiananmen Square on June
3 and 4, 1989. ``I love freedom. That is why I am here.''
</P>
<P>
   On that day, 20 members of Shanghai's most prominent opera
troupe were in Los Angeles to perform; as pictures of the massacre
filled television screens at the troupe's hotel, eight of them
sought asylum. Nearly all of them are now in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The workshop in Flushing offers six hours of courses embracing
the elements of kunqu opera _ first flute, then singing, followed
by movement and acting and concluding with percussion _ and all
classes are led by kunqu masters who learned their art in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a way to meet with other Chinese and to do something
cultural,'' said Shen Kuo-chen, a Taiwanese immigrant who is
working on a master's degree in Chinese art history. ``For me, it
is a way to learn it. I couldn't afford it in Taiwan, but I can
here.''
</P>
<P>
   All four principal genres of Chinese opera can be seen in New
York: Cantonese yue, popular in Hong Kong and Guangdong province;
Beijing, now known as the national opera form; Shanghai yue, heard
predominantly in central China, and kunqu, the most prized among
many cognoscenti.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a much more refined tradition,'' Isabelle Duchesne, a
French scholar of Chinese opera who works in New York, said of
kunqu. ``It has much stricter rules on rhyming and pronunciation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kunqu, like the other genres, is a musical drama, but it is also
a stage performance that combines ballet, poetry recital, opera and
music; classical poetry and literature, sung and recited, form the
basis of the drama itself. The performers dance and act in highly
stylized manners, each gesture carrying a precise meaning
understood by knowledgeable audiences. Elaborate and complex
costumes, many with long ``water sleeves'' that are repeatedly
folded and released in gentle movements, accord not with a
historical period but with roles played by a character in the
opera.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th
century, kunqu was gradually displaced by the less sophisticated
Beijing opera, which embraced showy acrobatic and martial scenes
that proved more popular to less literate audiences. Today, Beijing
opera receives the most government support in China.
</P>
<P>
   Cai and Ms. Shi were among the stars of Shanghai's kunqu opera
troupe, with Cai playing the physically arduous role of the
``chou,'' or clown, in each opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in primary school,'' he recalled, ``some people
from the Shanghai Theater School came to the school asking for
applicants. I wasn't chosen, but I snuck in anyway. As it turned
out, I was the only one who made it. We were really poor, and the
school took care of all our expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was that little, I didn't look too good,'' Cai said,
laughing. ``I was ugly. I was small. I behaved terribly. So the
professor said, `You be a chou.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much easier to produce a lot of Ph.D.'s than one
artist,'' Cai insisted, slapping the glass counter with his palm at
the Elmhurst video store. ``We have a saying: `10 years of training
and three seconds on stage.' Our whole lives are opera.''
</P>
<P>
   When he is not helping his wife at the video shop, Cai pilots a
small van around Queens, delivering Chinese food. ``Yes, it is very
difficult here,'' he said. ``In China, we didn't have to do
anything except put on makeup and perform. There were even people
to put on our hats. The Communist Party called us `engineers of the
human soul.' But still, we had to come here to be free, to raise
our son here.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Ms. Shi returned from an opera tour in
Austria. While she was gone, Cai and Chen performed at a gala opera
with two visiting stars from Shanghai before several hundred kunqu
aficionados at the Taipei Theater, on the Avenue of the Americas at
49th Street in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``As artists,'' Chen said, ``we would like to improve our
artistry. But we all have to work in the daytime, so we don't have
lots of chances to see each other's art. We don't have a lot of
opportunity to practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Strains of an operatic aria drifted from the television. ``But
you know,'' Ms. Shi said, ``our son does not like kunqu. He's 15.
He listens to Janet Jackson.''

HEAT AND DROUGHT FUEL WILDFIRES IN FLORIDA

<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ With record high temperatures and a prolonged
drought, Florida has been struck by at least 137 wildfires that in
just the last three weeks have burned more than 49,000 acres in 34
counties and injured at least 14 people.
</P>
<P>
   With the situation worsening, President Clinton declared the
entire state a disaster area on Friday, opening the door for
emergency assistance. The declaration, which had originally applied
to only eight counties in the hardest hit areas, in northern and
central Florida, enables fire victims to seek low-cost federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got people fighting fires for the last six to eight
weeks, and they are exhausted,'' Gov. Lawton Chiles said on Friday,
asking the federal Forestry Service to bring in substitute
firefighters to help as the fires continued to spread.
</P>
<P>
   At least 137 fires in 34 of Florida's 67 counties since May 25
have caused an estimated $13 million in losses statewide.
</P>
<P>
   The largest fire burned more than 6,453 acres of timber and
brush in Wakulla County in northern Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, a fire forced the evacuation of 1,100
people from Waldo, near Gainesville in northern Florida. But by
Friday evening, cars were returning to Waldo under clear skies and
a lingering smell of smoke.

   CLINTON-TRIP _ When he visits China beginning next week,
virtually everything President Clinton does _ every step he takes,
every place he goes, every bite he eats _ will have been
choreographed weeks in advance by a horde of advance men and women
who will have scheduled every second of his trip. After spending
hours studying videotapes of the routes Clinton will take, Secret
Service agents will have ensured that manhole covers are sealed and
air ducts blocked to prevent potential assassins from planting
bombs. His armor-plated limousine will have been flown ahead.
Hotels will have been comandeered for the president and his
entourage. Detailed briefing books will have been prepared for him,
providing classified information on the ranking officials with whom
he will meet. Phone banks will have been put in place for the
traveling White House press. Sophisticated electronics gear will
have been installed so the media can beam images back to the United
States. In all, hundreds of advance people will have worked around
the clock and millions of tax dollars will have been spent to make
sure the whole thing goes off without a hitch. (Deans, Cox News

   IRAN-SOCCER _ TEHRAN, Iran _ The U.S. plays Iran in the World
Cup soccer tournament Sunday. Except when Iraq is in crisis, Iran
is probably the biggest story in the Middle East right now. There
were huge street celebrations when Iran qualified for the
tournament. People said they bordered on political outbursts, and
there was concern among Iran's Islamic fundamentalist rulers when
many women celebrants removed their head coverings in violation of
religious dictates. Many other Iranians hope the match will lead to
a normalization of relations between the United States and Iran
after two decades of hostility. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

RUNWAYS PUT SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT ON MOST-DANGEROUS LIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At 6 p.m. on a recent Thursday at San Francisco
International Airport, the video monitors blinked a disheartening
message for about 200 United Shuttle passengers waiting to fly to
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The 5:50, 6 and 6:30 p.m. flights had just been canceled, and
the 6:15, 7 and 7:20 p.m. flights had been delayed. Only two of the
10 flights scheduled for the next three hours were expected to
depart on time.
</P>
<P>
   Delays are nothing new at the San Francisco airport, where the
weather and obsolete runways conspire against passengers and
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're always canceled, they're always late,'' said Stacy
Mines, a lawyer from Los Angeles during a recent three-hour wait
for the next flight.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than passengers are giving low marks to the airport,
the fifth-busiest in the nation and seventh-busiest in the world,
handling 40 million passengers and 428,000 flights a year. In its
annual rankings, the Federal Aviation Agency recently listed the
San Francisco airport as the second-worst for delays, behind Newark
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Then, two weeks ago, The Sunday Times of London reported that an
international pilots' group had placed the San Francisco airport
among the 15 most dangerous landing strips in the world. The
newspaper said its account was based on a leaked copy of a report
by the International Federation of Airline Pilots Associations at
its annual meeting in April.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots' group also gave the airport a ``black star.'' John
Mazor, spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association,
International, which is a member of the International Federation,
said the black star meant that the airport had ``critical safety
deficiencies.'' But Mazor said, ``Just because an airport has a
star, even a black star, doesn't mean it's unsafe.''
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the airport's poor ranking, he said, comes from
the fact that it conducts simultaneous operations on its two
parallel runways, which are only 750 feet apart. Under federal
regulations, runways must be at least 4,200 feet apart for landing
in foul weather.
</P>
<P>
   Airport administrators, while acknowledging serious problems,
say the ranking is unfair. ``We have never had the death of a
commercial passenger in our history since the airport was opened in
1926,'' said Ron Wilson, director of airport public affairs, ``and
we have never had an accident that was associated with the runways'
being too close.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said delays and difficult landing conditions resulted
from the old runways, which were designed in the 1920s for DC-10
aircraft, which have wingspans about half as wide as today's jumbo
jets. The length of the runways poses no problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But if fog rolls in in the morning, the airport must cancel at
least half of its flights, delaying all arrivals and departures for
the rest of the day. Plans for expanding the distance between the
runways have been under way for more than a year. An airport
consultant began a study early this month designed to reduce
delays, ease the impact of noise on the community and make the
runways at least 4,300 feet apart.
</P>
<P>
   The project would require the airport to fill in 400 acres of
the San Francisco Bay, with a cost that could exceed $1 billion.
The work, which could begin in 2002, would be financed by airport
bonds, to be backed by the city and San Francisco County.

   Cumulus clouds will develop into isolated afternoon
thunderstorms Sunday in interior New England as low pressure which
has brought the recent unsettled weather lifts slowly offshore. Low
clouds and chilly onshore winds will prevail along the coast from
Maine to Cape Cod, though coastal areas should be spared the
showers that will plague the interior.
</P>
<P>
   Sultry air will dominate in the Middle Atlantic States. High
pressure aloft will provide sunshine from central New York to
eastern South Carolina, though a few thunderstorms could develop
over the Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Hot and muggy conditions will continue over much of the
Southeast. Morning low clouds will yield to afternoon sunshine
dimmed at times by cumulus clouds. Clusters of thunderstorms will
develop over the Ohio Valley and move southeastward, bringing
drenching rains to portions of the region. A vigorous jet stream
disturbance will spawn severe thunderstorms in Michigan with hail,
strong winds, and isolated tornadoes. Thunderstorms will also
develop along a cold front from southern Illinois through northern
Arkansas, while pesky showers and cool breezes swirl around low
pressure from Minnesota to eastern Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, searing heat will continue over Texas. Late day
thunderstorms will develop in the northern Rockies as a disturbance
rotates around low pressure aloft. Building warmth will dominate in
the valleys of the Pacific Northwest, while showers dot the peaks
of the Cascades. The Southwest will be sunny and seasonably warm,
with the exception of low clouds along the California coast.
</P>
<P>
   Summer Arrives
</P>
<P>
   The official start of summer is at 10:03 a.m. ET Sunday, but
astronomy, not meteorology, is the deciding factor. It is then that
the northward trek of the sun's rays across the planet will cease.
At that moment when the sun stood still, the summer solstice had
arrived. For the next six months, the direct rays of the sun will
move inexorably south, culminating in the winter solstice. But
alas, the summer season is the slowest to fade. As a result of the
elliptical shape of the earth's orbit around the sun, the Northern
Hemisphere summer lasts 93 days while winter is 89 days long.

IN SCORCHING CONDITIONS, THERE ARE NO DEGREES OF SEPARATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BORDEAUX, France _ The temperature on the field was 102 degrees,
which meant that the Mexican fans underneath their licensed
sombreros had a big advantage over the Belgian fans brandishing
inflatable red tridents.
</P>
<P>
   But after the last brow had been mopped and the last water
bottle had been drained, neither of their teams would have an
advantage in the Parc Lescure. This World Cup Group E match was one
that neither Belgium nor Mexico could afford to lose, and, as has
often been the case in France this June, neither team lost.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 26 matches played thus far in the finals, 10 have
finished in draws, but what made this 2-2 affair more compelling
than most was that the Mexicans had to rally from a two-goal
deficit to salvage the point that kept them on top of their
difficult group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I should be happy or sad,'' said Belgium's
coach, Georges Leekens. ``But when you have a 2-0 lead and a man
advantage, you should find a way to finish off the match.''
</P>
<P>
   The Belgians took their man advantage in the 29th minute, after
Pavel Pardo was given a red card for a tackle from behind on
Belgian defender Vital Borkelmans. In less evangelical times, the
tackle might have earned Pardo only a yellow card, but in the
current climate, it was difficult to find fault with referee Hugh
Dallas' judgment.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgians, prone to imprecise passing and ballhandling
errors, took their time to capitalize, but in the 44th minute they
scored off a corner kick from their Brazilian-born striker Luis
Oliveira. The ball brushed the head of defender Claudio Suarez and
deflected off Marc Wilmots past Jorge Campos.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly the most aesthetic goal of this tournament, but
then Wilmots, a solidly built 29-year-old who runs more like a
pulling guard than an attacking midfielder, is not known for his
flair. He is known for his efficiency and his power, and three
minutes into the second half, he took control of the ball outside
the Mexican penalty area and essentially bowled over the luckless
Suarez, shoving him out of the way with his left forearm, and
scoring his second goal with a jab of his right foot.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was the heat, perhaps it was the Mexicans' superior
technical skill, but with only 10 men, they began to penetrate the
Belgian defense with more consistency, and when JesusRamirez drove
into the penalty box and was brought down from behind by Belgian
midfielder Gert Verheyen, the Scottish referee immediately awarded
the Mexicans a penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mexican players wanted more than a chance to score in
the 55th minute, they wanted a chance to play the rest of this
match on even terms, and before Dallas had a chance to reach into
his pocket, five players had formed an angry wall in front of him
and screamed for a red card. Dallas took his time, but he would
soon grant the Mexican wish.
</P>
<P>
   It was the eighth red card awarded in the last seven matches of
these World Cup finals. But unlike other coaches who have fallen
victim to the new zeal, Leekens declined to cry foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone complains about referees, but this was a good one,''
he said. ``I think the red card he gave to the Mexicans was right,
and I think the penalty kick against us was right, too.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mexican Captain Alberto Garcia Aspe put that penalty kick
into the lower right corner of the Belgian goal, neither he nor his
teammates were feeling the heat, and on their next serious chance
in the 63rd minute, they would score the equalizer. This goal had
nothing in common with Wilmots' ungainly efforts. It came off a
wonderfully timed left-footed cross from Ramirez that striker
Cuauhtemoc Blanco put past goalkeeper Filip de Wilde with a left
footed volley in mid-air that looked every bit as difficult as it
was.

A STRONG WELLS CARRIES YANKEES TO 50TH VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Ronald Reagan was voted into the White House the
last year the Yankees won 100 or more games, in 1980. Don Mattingly
never played on a pinstriped team that won 100 games, nor did Dave
Righetti. No easy feat, 100 victories.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees of 1998 are already halfway to that benchmark
after beating Cleveland by 5-3 Saturday afternoon as David Wells
pitched eight strong innings. The Yankees have played fewer games
than any other major league team, because of rainouts and the
Yankee Stadium closing, but they became the first to win 50 games
this season. The Atlanta Braves had a 49-24 record as they prepared
to play Montreal Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have won four of their last eight, their pace
slowing somewhat in the midst of what figures to be the most
challenging two weeks of their season, with games in Baltimore and
Cleveland, with games against the Braves and the Mets, and without
Bernie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Yankees' winning percentage is .746; they
would win 121 games if they continue this pace, which would shatter
the modern-day major-league record of 111 victories. Should they
win 47 of their remaining 95 games _less than half _ they would
finish the season 97-65. A hundred victories seems inevitable,
especially since all elements of the team are functioning
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   With Wells' outing Saturday, the Yankees' pitching rotation has
turned in 17 consecutive starts of five and a third innings or
more; only twice in 39 games since May 6 has a Yankees starter
failed to last five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Wells' performance may have been his best since his perfect game
on May 17. His curveball dived across the strike zone, his fastball
was explosive, his command nearly impeccable. Jorge Posada, the
Yankees' catcher, would set his target, inside or outside, and
Wells would hit it constantly, expertly. Wells allowed two runs,
eight hits, no walks and struck out eight.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' offense has sputtered somewhat in the absence of
Williams, and Tino Martinez, the first baseman, has not regained
his stroke since being hit in the back by Baltimore's Armando
Benitez last month. Martinez has said his right shoulder sometimes
feels weak, as he pulls the bat through the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees manage to find a way, from all corners of their
lineup. With the Yankees down by 1-0, Paul O'Neill opened the
fourth inning with a single. Martinez then pulled a grounder past
first baseman Jim Thome into the right-field corner. Manny Ramirez,
Cleveland's right fielder, fumbled with the ball a bit before
relaying it back to the infield, and O'Neill _ who appeared to slow
after rounding second _ scored just ahead of the throw. For
Martinez, it was his first double since May 15, four days before he
was hit by Benitez.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Raines then grounded to second, with Martinez taking third.
Darryl Strawberry, starting his third consecutive game, slammed a
high drive to right field, where Ramirez backed against the wall,
reached up and gloved the ball _ only to bounce against the fence
and lose control of the ball. Martinez scored easily, and
Strawberry pulled into second with a double,
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry appeared to be limping heavily as he rounded first
and pulled into second. Although he has 10 home runs and produces
runs when he plays, Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, has been
reluctant to use Strawberry on a regular basis to protect his
surgically repaired left knee.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth inning, Scott Brosius led off against Cleveland
starter Dave Burba (8-5) by hitting a high fastball it into the
stands in left-center field, an estimated 419 feet. It was the
seventh homer of the season for Brosius.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Chuck Knoblauch walked and took second when Derek
Jeter reached base on an error by Thome. O'Neill then pulled a
single through the right side of the infield, and Knoblauch raced
home, giving the Yankees a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' defense has been exceptional all season, and an
errant throw by Jeter in the third inning was the first error by a
Yankees shortstop this season, and only the third error of the year
by Jeter. Before allowing an unearned run Friday, the Yankees'
defense had allowed only one in the previous 185 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The defense helped Wells get through an eighth-inning jam. David
Bell singled to right-center, where Chad Curtis hustled over to
retrieve the ball, and after Bell thought about trying for second
and then fell down stopping, the Yankees nabbed him in a rundown.
Curtis ran down a fly from Kenny Lofton in left-center for the
second out. The Indians scored a single run in the inning, cutting
the Yankees' edge to 4-2.

   Mike Stanton, who is appealing the five-game suspension handed
down this week by American League President Gene Budig, thought his
appeal would be heard on Monday. In fact, his hearing has not been
scheduled, and according to a league official, it will not occur
Monday. If Stanton begins to serve the suspension on Wednesday, as
scheduled, then he will miss two games against the Atlanta Braves
and all three games of the interleague series with the Mets.

DOMINICK DELLA ROCCA, 75, BUSINESSMAN AND VOLUNTEER  
 (HLW)

   NEW YORK _ Dominick Della Rocca, a Brooklyn businessman and
community volunteer who rebuilt a network of what he called
``neighborhood mayors'' in and around New York to provide trips to
the circus or to Shea Stadium for baseball games for handicapped
young people, died on June 11 at Loyola University Medical Center,
in Maywood, Ill. He was 75 and lived in Breezy Point, N.Y., in
Queens County.
</P>
<P>
   He died of natural causes, according to the Colonial Funeral
Home.
</P>
<P>
   Della Rocca was instrumental in the revival of what is now known
as Community Mayors of New York and New Jersey and served as its
director. An all-volunteer group based in Brooklyn, it organizes
recreational trips and shows for children and adults with special
needs. Typical events have been visits to Coney Island, the circus
in Manhattan, the New York Aquarium, and the Bronx Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, he helped create a summer camp for blind children
in Suffern, N.Y., known as Camp Montebello.
</P>
<P>
   He was also persuasive in getting local businesses to donate
assorted goodies or to help troubled youths.
</P>
<P>
   A Brooklyn native, he served in Europe in World War II, and,
upon returning, went into the restaurant business begun in 1894 by
his grandparents. Besides running his various restaurants, he was
chairman of the Southwest Brooklyn Industrial Development Board,
and he helped found the Fort Greene Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   Della Rocca also sat on the New York City Youth Board under
Mayors Abraham Beame and Ed Koch.
</P>
<P>
   The Community Mayors group was a revival of an organization
called the Locality Mayors that was founded in 1875 in Manhattan.
For a time, every block on the Lower East Side had a member,
usually a politician or saloon keeper to whom people would take
their troubles and receive rent money or a Christmas turkey in
return for their votes.
</P>
<P>
   Under the leadership of Louis Zeltner, a newspaperman, the group
became a charity and shed its political associations, but it broke
up after his death decades ago. Della Rocca adopted the idea as a
way to aid the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Phyllis; a daughter, Shelley Aprea
of Flemington, N.J.; a son, Peter J., of Cranford, N.J.; and two
granddaughters.

D.I. AXELROD, 87, EXPERT ON EVOLUTION OF PLANTS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FORD BURKHART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Daniel I. Axelrod, a paleoecologist at the University of
California at Davis who reconstructed the ancient landscapes of the
West by examining plant fossils, died on June 2 at his home in
Davis. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Axelrod reported how wet forests slowly turned into Nevada's
deserts over 40 million years of the Earth's cooling and heating
and tracked the migration of plants to places that suited them
better.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Axelrod's most important work came after he retired as a
professor of geology and botany at Davis and became what many
colleges call an emeritus professor, with no teaching to do. Before
long, he won an award as the outstanding researcher at Davis, won
top awards from several national research organizations and
received a Guggenheim fellowship to boot.
</P>
<P>
   Axelrod roamed the world looking at how plants adapt to new
environments, and he came up with ways to account for the migration
of entire forests in response to climate changes.
</P>
<P>
   He documented the evolution of America's grasslands, its central
prairies, the deserts of Arizona, New Mexico and Nevada, and the
zones of thorny thickets called chaparral in the foothills of the
Rockies and the Sierra Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   All this, said Dr. Michael Barbour, a botanist and professor of
environmental horticulture at Davis, was a scope of work achieved
by few botanists. Axelrod created maps showing how plant
communities evolved through most of the Western United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reconstructed the climate and topography, the steepness of
slopes, the height of mountains, all from studying the fossils in
the rocks he found, by looking at the veins and margins of the
leaves of the ancestors of plants we see today,'' Barbour said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Axelrod's collection of tens of thousands of
fossils showed him that the Sierra Nevada were once just gentle
foothills, with slopes rising no more than 2,000 feet. He also
found that the giant redwoods, lately living in California, were
once rooted in Nevada's ancient wet forestland.
</P>
<P>
   He could identify the ancient plants, compare them with their
modern relatives and then make surmises about what the Earth was
like millions of years ago, Barbour said. ``He followed the basic
principle of paleobotany: The present is the key to the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Axelrod, who wrote about such topics as dinosaur extinction and
plate tectonics, was a founder of the discipline of paleobotany,
which uses fossils to recreate climates that existed millions of
years ago, said Dr. Jay Quade, director of the Desert Laboratory of
the University of Arizona in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Axelrod figured out that today's plants of a dry Nevada evolved
from ancestral plants that lived in central Mexico long ago in a
zone like the Nevada desert of today.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Isaac Axelrod was born in Brooklyn, N.Y. He received all
his degrees from the University of California at Berkeley, his B.A.
in botany in 1933, and his M.A. and Ph.D., both in botany and
paleontology, in 1936 and 1938.
</P>
<P>
   He served in the Army from 1942 to 1946, winning the Bronze Star
for his work in photographic intelligence in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, Axelrod joined the University of California at Los
Angeles, moved to the Davis campus in 1967 and became an emeritus
professor there in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   His marriage to Nancy Robinson ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Marilyn Gayler Axelrod; a son, Peter
Axelrod, of Santa Rosa, Calif.; a stepdaughter, Hillary Dion
Gayler, of Davis; a sister, Dorothy Heller Axelrod, of Arcata,
Calif.; and a brother, Walter Axelrod, of Rainbow, Calif.; and one
grandchild.

AMERICANS TAKE ON IRAN WITH A SENSE OF DIPLOMACY AND URGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYONS, France _ It is great that the Clinton administration
wants to reconcile with Iran, Alexi Lalas said. He and his U.S.
teammates will shake hands with Iran's players before Sunday's game
and exchange jerseys afterward. But this is the World Cup, and
politics must take a backseat to soccer, he said. Ultimately, it is
more urgent to win the game than to win new friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we establish good relations with another country, fine,
just give us three points,'' Lalas said.
</P>
<P>
   Without a victory over Iran, the United States (0-1) has almost
no chance of advancing to the second round of the World Cup. And
yet anything less would mean disappointment and a failure to match
its accomplishments during the 1994 World Cup. In fact, the
Americans not only need to beat Iran, they will also very likely
need to win by at least two goals, given the tie breaker formula
used to determine which teams advance in soccer's world
championship tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Because his team needs goals, and because it is looking to
relieve the timidity that accompanied its 2-0 loss to Germany last
Monday, Coach Steve Sampson has called for more risk taking and
assertiveness in the team's attack. He may even abandon the 3-6-1
formation, with its lone forward, in favor of two forwards. If so,
he could either start Eric Wynalda and Roy Wegerle up front, or
perhaps start Wynalda with Tab Ramos as a withdrawn forward.
</P>
<P>
   Frankie Hejduk, the world's fastest surfer, will certainly
replace Mike Burns at right wing. Ramos could also replace the
invisible Ernie Stewart as an attacking midfielder. The coach is
holding his intended lineup like a poker hand, revealing nothing.
But some believe Sampson may push David Regis into midfield and
start Lalas as a marking back to counter Iran's imposing
6-foot-4-inch forward, Ali Daei.
</P>
<P>
   A metallurgical engineer from the Azerbaijan region of Iran,
Daei had a father who did not want him to play until he had
graduated from high school. But his mother was sympathetic to her
son's athletic interests.
</P>
<P>
   His mother must have a wonderful eye for talent. Her son now
plays in the prestigious German Bundesliga and has just signed for
next season with Bayern Munich. He is strong in the air and
unafraid of contact. Iran committed 30 fouls in a fearless 1-0 loss
to Yugoslavia, and Daei was whistled nine times. This is why
Sampson may assign Lalas to him, muscle for muscle.
</P>
<P>
   At 6-3, Lalas would also enjoy a considerable height advantage
over many Iranian players, which could come in handy on finishing
corner kicks in front of the opposing goal, where he can be
dangerous. But a different lineup and a different formation will
not matter unless the Americans also bring a new attitude to the
Iran game. Formations don't win games, determined players do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize this is a do-or-die game for us,'' said Lalas, who
has been shorn of playing time this World Cup the way he has been
shorn of the billowing red hair that made him the most recognizable
U.S. player four years ago. ``We feel confident we should beat Iran
if we play with a spirit and a passion that didn't exist the last
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is impossible to ignore the political component of
this match. Not after 20 years of contentious history. Not after
the president of the United States has used the run-up to the game
to announce that he wants a thaw in the frozen relationship.
President Clinton has taped a conciliatory message that will be
broadcast on television Sunday before the game, a message in which
the president says he hopes the game can be a ``step toward ending
the estrangement between our nations.'' And the U.S. players are
happy to contribute their small part as soccer diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful opportunity for the sport of soccer to bring
two countries together,'' Wynalda said. ``It shows the beauty of
the World Cup. Obviously, there have been political differences.
But we can show there are more important things, like human
relations.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Iran, too, relishes the chance to be called a sporting power
instead of an international pariah.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in 20 years, Iran's name is not being
associated with terrorism, bombing or war,'' said Mehrdad Masoudi,
a native of Iran who is a spokesman for the Canadian soccer
federation and who is working as a press officer at the World Cup.
``It has revived a sense of pride among Iranian people.''
</P>
<P>
   Sentiment aside, the two countries are still far apart, and
officials are on guard against the possible disruption of politics
and violence. No banners will be allowed inside Gerland Stadium on
Sunday. A Swiss referee has been appointed, a neutral arbiter from
a neutral country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's quite appropriate,'' Sampson said.
</P>
<P>
   Security has been increased around the teams and the stadium.
Soccer's world governing body said it feared that Iranian exile
groups opposed to the fundamentalist regime might try to interrupt
the game. But members of the National Council of Resistance of Iran
said in an interview that they had ``no intentions'' of causing any
problems during the match and accused the Iranian government of
conducting a misinformation campaign.
</P>
<P>
   When the game begins, both teams must be aware of the new
get-tough policy on tackling from behind. Red cards have been
issued like chocolates in recent days. ``We're perplexed'' over the
inconsistent officiating, Sampson said. And both sides must be
careful not to let the emotion overcome skill and tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they're playing for history,'' Lalas said of the
Iranians. ``It just adds pressure on them.'' He added, ``The danger
is, too much emotion can make you do something stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasey Keller, the U.S. goalkeeper, said, ``Both governments
would like to get one over on each other.'' But, for two hours,
politics will dissolve into soccer and players will take the stage
away from the politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite what everybody thinks, we are going to play
football,'' Daei said.
</P>
<P>
   And when the game is over, Sampson said, he will try to collect
an Iranian jersey, perhaps Daei's, for his 9-year-old son, Brandon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a historic game,'' Sampson said. ``Why wouldn't you want
to save a great memento from a historic game?''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ A small placard hangs on a wall in Commander
Maurita Bryant's office so that she can always see it from behind
her desk. It reads, ``Of course women don't work as hard as men;
they do it right the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of 14 commanders on the Pittsburgh police force, Ms.
Bryant gets more than her share of opportunities to do things right
the first time. And so do hundreds of other women in blue who
patrol the streets of the nation's 48th largest city.
</P>
<P>
   On a police force of 1,100 officers, 25 percent are women, the
highest percentage of any law-enforcement agency in the United
States and more than twice the average percentage, says a recent
study by the National Center for Women and Policing, a Los Angeles
division of the Feminist Majority Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which reflects the composition of 100 agencies in
1997, also found that the Pittsburgh force included the nation's
highest percentage of women in command positions, 37.5 percent. In
addition to Ms. Bryant, whose district has the highest crime rate
in the city, five other women in Pittsburgh are commanders, a rank
just below assistant chief and deputy chief.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh is just one of a number of major cities where crime
rates are steadily falling, and neither Ms. Bryant nor any other
senior official on the force attributes the trend to the large
number of women who are officers. More likely, they agreed, new
community policing techniques and updated technology were helping
the department to turn from a reactive style, largely responding to
911 calls, to a preventive approach.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Ms. Bryant and other women on the Pittsburgh force
say the skills women bring to the job add vital components to
policing. Women, they say, are more inclined than men to use
communication skills to quell potentially violent situations, and
they can bring an extra sensitivity to situations involving
children and rape victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you bring diversity to any work environment, especially
policing, you add to the overall performance of the whole
department,'' said Chief Robert McNeilly, who agreed with many
women on the force who said that the days when male officers were
reluctant to have women as partners were generally over.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the progress women have made on the Pittsburgh
force, many fear a backslide. A 1976 court order demanding that for
every white man hired, the force had to hire a woman and two
members of minorities, one a man and one a woman, expired in 1991.
Ever since, the number of women and members of minorities joining
the force has slowed. And in a recent lawsuit against the city,
eight white men who failed to get jobs on the force, won
settlements in a reverse discrimination case.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here say the main impediment to recruiting highly
qualified women _ and men _ is the strong national economy, which
is enabling private industry to offer higher pay for entry-level
positions to people who would be attracted to a career in law
enforcement. In addition, municipal budget constraints, as
elsewhere, have slowed hiring. McNeilly said he did not expect the
city to replace officers who retired or resigned for more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   But those explanations ring hollow to people who track the
advances of women in law enforcement. Recalling the days of the
court order, Penny Harrington, president of the group that
conducted the survey, said, ``When they were forced to find women,
they found them.''
</P>
<P>
   McNeilly and Mayor Tom Murphy said they remained sensitive to
the issue and they vowed to take new approaches to find qualified
women for the force. They said they intended to step up their
recruiting efforts and to focus on women leaving the military as a
likely pool of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Harrington criticized that approach, calling it ``the
old way'' of thinking. ``Why not look on college campuses, nursing
schools, look for paralegals and social workers?'' she asked.
``They already have the mindset to help people, not kill them.''
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, at least, Pittsburgh remains a showcase for
women in policing. The survey found that only five other cities _
Detroit, Miami, Philadelphia, Washington and Toledo, Ohio _ had
police forces in which women accounted for 20 percent of officers.
In all those cities but Miami, the strong presence of women was
aided by a court order, the survey found. On Miami's force of 2,920
officers, no woman serves in a command position.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the survey found that 42 agencies _ including the
police departments in Nassau County, N.Y., and Newark, N.J., the
state police in New York and New Jersey, and the Port Authority of
New York-New Jersey _ had fewer than 10 percent female officers in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bryant, 45, who is black and a divorced mother of two grown
daughters, leads a district of 124 officers and supervisors who
patrol a zone where more homicides are committed than in any other
district in the city. She joined the force in 1977, when she was
just looking for a dependable job, she said, ``and the idea of
having a female supervisor was unheard of.''
</P>
<P>
   As she rose in rank over the years, she said, attitudes slowly
changed as men on the force grew more comfortable with women
because of the skills women brought to the job.
</P>
<P>
   In many situations, Ms. Bryant said, women serve as a soothing
balance to the macho tendencies of male officers, a situation that
is influencing men on the force.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Rosato-Barone, 40, the commander of another high-crime
zone, who joined the force in 1979, agreed, saying: ``I think
adding women to the force has helped make the men more sensitive.
They hate to hear that they are becoming touchy-feely; they prefer
the image of tough and strong. I beg to differ. They're human
beings like everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling her days as a patrol officer, Ms. Bryant said, ``There
were situations where if I had approached them like a man, acting
super tough, I'd have gotten knocked on my butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Job skills aside, women on the force say there is still some
resentment among male colleagues, especially older officers who
were on the force before the court order changed its makeup. Sgt.
Jim O'Brien, a veteran of 28 years who works in Ms. Bryant's zone,
said he, among other men, was slow to ``welcome women with open
arms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of men accept the women now,'' he said. ``But
there are always a few who still don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bryant, who grew up in a housing project and saw police
officers as people to be feared, conceded that old ways die hard
among some officers. But most men working under her command, she
said, dare not display any signs of discomfort or disrespect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hear any snickers,'' she said. ``When you have to
discipline a male officer, with white guys you usually see a level
of red in their face, and with black guys, you see them tense their
jaw muscles. It's interesting to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   But the surest sign of progress, she said, may be the blackboard
in the men's room, on which officers scribble complaints and nasty
remarks _ or so she is told.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far,'' she said with a smile, ``I don't think I've been on
it.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ When George Perry caught his world record
22-pound-6-ounce bass nearly 70 years ago, he won a national
fishing contest sponsored by Field &AMP; Stream. The fish he pulled
from Montgomery Lake, Ga., in 1932 won him $75. That amount is
$999,925 less than the winners took home at a four-day bass
tournament that concluded Saturday along the banks of the
Connecticut River.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Forrest Wood Open, part of the Wal-Mart FLW Tour, the
contest marked the richest bass-fishing event in history, complete
with elimination rounds, television coverage and enough corporate
sponsors to rival the Olympics. Prizes ranged from $200,000 for
first place in the professional division, which was won by Randall
Hutson of Washburn, Mo., with a five-fish limit weighing in at 8
pounds 6 ounces, to $40,000 for the amateur division, which was won
by Frank Free of Buford, Ga., with a five-fish limit weighing 6
pounds 11 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate category, bass pro Denny Brauer of Camdenton, Mo.,
gathered the most points and won the right to have his face adorn a
box of Wheaties.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by the big cash handouts and nationwide exposure,
competitive fishing tournaments, for better or worse, are booming
for everything from marlin to walleye. Even trout fishermen, long
considered too solitary and contemplative to bother with such
distractions, now hold elaborate ``one-fly'' contests, where only a
single fly can be used during a day's fishing.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, after two elimination rounds, only 10 boats and 20
anglers remained from the original field of 300 men. In bass
tournaments, each boat is teamed with a professional and an
amateur, but catches are scored separately. Total daily weight
determines who advances and, ultimately, who wins the top prizes.
</P>
<P>
   But Mother Nature had thrown a curveball: near record rainfall
the week before sent the Connecticut into flood stage. The high
water had scattered the cover-loving largemouth and smallmouth deep
into submerged bushes and trees _ what a bass fisherman
affectionately refers to as ``slop.'' With such poor conditions,
results had ranged from complete skunkings to just a few fish with
average weights of about a pound and a half.
</P>
<P>
   As the 6 a.m. ``blastoff'' approached, anglers furiously tied on
new lures and arranged entire batteries of fishing rods on the
decks of gleaming bass boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some catching to do,'' one of the pros was heard
shouting over the growl of his huge outboard.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike George Perry, who reportedly caught his fish using $4
worth of tackle (including the makeshift boat he assembled with 75
cents worth of scrap lumber), a tournament bass angler lugs enough
gear to warrant a second mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   At precisely 6 o'clock, each boat roared away from the dock,
then wound and twisted its way beneath Bulkeley and Founders
Bridges in downtown Hartford at speeds more suitable for a James
Bond movie than a fishing contest.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next hour, most anglers had settled into their
respective spots. Bass pro Randy Howell of Littleton, N.C.,
relentlessly cast into a single concrete culvert no more than 30
feet wide to eke out two little smallmouth by the 2 p.m. deadline.
He earned $23,000 for his eight-hour shift, but was eliminated from
the next day's competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been staring at the same concrete walls for three days.
Felt like I was prison,'' Howell said. ``I'm kind of glad I don't
have to fish there anymore.''
</P>

<P>
   Three boats fished an oxbow in the river called Chapman Pond,
some 30 miles south of Hartford. Among them was an old-time pro
named Basil Bacon of Springfield, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's great,'' said Chris Blais, a 24-year-old spectator from
Willington, Conn. ``I met him last week, and he autographed the
inside of the live well of my boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon carefully made his way along the edge of a submerged weed
bed, methodically slipping a plastic jig into tiny pockets. A
scarlet tananger sang in the woods. Except for the television crew
taping his every move some 30 feet away, it seemed like the perfect
image of bass fishing, far from the hype and endless promotion of
the fishing shows.
</P>
<P>
   An hour passed with no fish taken. An osprey soared into view,
spent a minute surveying the situation, then matter-of-factly
plunged into the pond coming up with a largemouth, weight
undetermined. It flew to a nearby dead tree and promptly ate its
catch.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Terry Bolton of Paducah, Ky., had found clear water
where the Salmon River enters the Connecticut. ``This high water
put a lot of fish where you can't get to them,'' Bolton said calmly
as if it was a lazy Sunday afternoon rather than a high-stakes
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more about me against the fish. It's not about the
money,'' he said. ``Some guys fish this hard for a six-pack of
Coke.''

YANKS-BRAVES SERIES COULD BE A PRELUDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLAIRE SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Atlanta Braves roar into Yankee Stadium for
the highly anticipated interleague match between the top teams in
the National and American Leagues Monday night, much may be made of
what the Braves have yet to fix since losing to the Yankees in the
1996 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' bullpen has not seemed the same since Jim Leyritz
demystified the Braves' stopper, Mark Wohlers, with one mighty
three-run home run in the '96 Series.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers, who was on the disabled list last month, has pitched
poorly since coming back, allowing six hits, nine walks and seven
runs in six and two-thirds innings. The struggles were so obvious
that the Braves sent the pitcher to the minors on Friday so he
could work on mechanics with a pitching coach. That leaves the
closer's duties in the hands of the 43-year-old Dennis Martinez,
who has two of the Braves' relatively small total of 17 saves.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect the Yankees or any team trying to measure its
worth against the Braves to fixate solely on this flaw. Not when
the Braves, already strong because of their starting pitching, have
adroitly filled other holes. Indeed, the Braves come to town
potentially tougher than they were a year ago when they won two of
three games in interleague play against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' 49-24 record _ as of Saturday afternoon _ and .671
winning percentage are second in the major leagues to the Yankees'
marks of 49-17, .742.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' starters are omnipresent and as effective as ever,
with three consecutive complete-game victories by the rookie Kevin
Millwood, Denny Neagle and the incomparable Greg Maddux in the last
week alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of our starters have an idea of what they need to
do,'' said Maddux, who became this season's first 10-game winner
when he pitched a four-hitter against the Florida Marlins on
Tuesday. ``I realize I can't pitch like John Smoltz, and Denny
Neagle realizes he can't pitch like me. And none of us can pitch
like Millwood. What we do is a good job of wanting to pitch. That's
huge. The starters around here want the ball and that's half the
battle.''
</P>
<P>
   For once, though, the starting pitching isn't necessarily the
primary weapon. At least not since Andres Galarraga came on board
and established himself as perhaps the most profitable pickup of
the off-season, as well as a player capable of transforming an
entire offense.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga, a former Colorado Rockie turned free-agent
acquisition, has spent the season not only bashing the baseball,
but also shattering the notions that he is an over-the-hill player
incapable of compiling big numbers without the aid of the thin air
of mile-high Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga, 37, who was refused three guaranteed years by the
Rockies, found a home in Atlanta. The first-base replacement for
Fred McGriff has driven in 67 runs, strong evidence that Galarraga
remains more than capable of driving in 145 runs, his average the
last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the home runs. Galarraga has lost nothing in the
transition from high altitude to sea level. Rather, he is making
Turner Field look as cozy as Coors Field, peppering a stadium that
was initially thought to favor pitchers with 11 of his 25 home
runs, all but one farther than 400 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We loved Freddy, but this guy has already hit as many home
runs as Freddy did all last season,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox
said. ``The impact has been awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga, who has a smile that never wanes, does not mind
sharing his feeling of vindication. ``When I come from Coors, a lot
of people were thinking I couldn't be the same hitter,'' he said.
``But I say, well, I won't put a lot of pressure on myself, I'll
just go out continue what I've been doing the last couple years.''
</P>
<P>
   The different look has not been in the explosive offense alone.
Galarraga gives the Braves a right-handed threat in the middle of
an order once top-heavy with left-handed hitters and therefore
vulnerable to left-handed pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Left-handed relievers could be brought in to force a
switch-hitter like Chipper Jones to his less potent right-handed
side, then dominate left-handed swingers like McGriff and Ryan
Klesko, as the Yankees' Graeme Lloyd did so memorably in the '96
Series. Now Galarraga sits nestled between Jones and Klesko and the
effect is trickling up as well as down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made our lineup a lot tougher to defend if you're an
opposing manager,'' said Jones, who has 18 homers and 57 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   While Galarraga and shortstop Walt Weiss are the most notable
additions, the Braves also shored up their once questionable
supporting cast, which, like the bullpen, paled in comparison to
the Yankees' waves of onetime all-stars in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves still don't have the likes of Darryl Strawberry,
Cecil Fielder and Tim Raines coming off the bench, but they have
added some experience in the form of Gerald Williams, Curtis Pride
and Ozzie Guillen.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a former Yankee reserve outfielder and onetime regular
in Milwaukee, has played sparingly. But a pair of doubles and two
RBI in a spot start against Florida last week were indicative of
the contributions he and other substitutes are making.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure I want to play, I understand my responsibility on this
team and I have to look at anything that is asked of me in a
positive nature and I do so,'' Williams said after driving his RBI
total to 15 in 84 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have not only added offense and depth since last seen
by the Yankees. They eradicated some concerns over the defense up
the middle. Not only did the Braves add the smooth-fielding Weiss,
but they also said goodbye to center fielder Kenny Lofton. The
former Gold Glove winner inexplicably failed to impress afield in
his one season in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   In Lofton's place stands the young Andruw Jones, who first
turned heads when at age 19 he hit two dramatic home runs in Game 1
of the '96 Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me he's the best center fielder in all of baseball, without
a doubt,'' Cox said of Andruw Jones, who is hitting .263 with 12
home runs and 42 RBI.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While these added elements bring a new dimension to a now
entrenched 1990s rivalry, the Yankees will find some things about
the Braves a time-honored continuum, namely Maddux, Tom Glavine and
John Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine beat every major leaguer to the 10-victory plateau last
week and has only lost twice. Glavine needs one more victory to
reach double figures. Millwood (9-3), a rookie Cox proudly
describes as ``a tough kid with good mound sense,'' had his worst
outing Friday when he gave up seven runs in one-and-a-third innings
against the Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood, Andruw Jones, Javier Lopez and Chipper Jones stand as
proof that the Braves, much like the Yankees, grow quality players
as well as buy them. And like the Yankees' Andy Pettitte, Mariano
Rivera and Derek Jeter, the young Braves show a certain maturity by
welcoming the veterans' input.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood, a right-hander, said: ``I think I'm the luckiest
pitcher in all of baseball right now, being able to be around the
type of guys I am around. Everybody likes each other, everybody's
trying to learn all the time. If you want to know something you
just ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Or simply watch and learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing I want to do like these guys do is get ahead of
the hitters,'' Millwood said. ``That has really been a key to their
success, that they get ahead of guys and try to get them out as
quick as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   After the two games in New York and the two in Atlanta are over,
both clubs will have a measure of how they match up, important
because this is more than an interleague curiosity piece. The
Yankees and Braves are providing hints of what might come in a
World Series rematch many believe is as inevitable as it would be
intriguing.

EDITORIAL: SURINAME'S EXAMPLE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, June 20:
</P>
<P>
   The world's forests have been under siege since the turn of the
century, but this year has been calamitous. In Canada, Brazil,
Mexico, Central America, Africa, and Indonesia, fires have
destroyed nearly 40 million forested acres, an area as large as New
York state. The easy explanation is El Nino, a perverse weather
system that has flooded some regions but left others bone dry. But
the main culprit, as always, is human activity, chiefly logging,
mining, and agriculture, which dries out the forest by stripping it
bare of trees, leaving even humid tropical rain forests vulnerable
to fire. For that reason, the fires are likely to reoccur, with or
without El Nino, unless something is done to curb mankind's
insatiable appetite for wood.
</P>
<P>
   In that context, there was a small ray of hope in the
announcement last week that a small South American country,
Suriname, had decided to give permanent protection to four million
acres of untouched tropical forests, about one-tenth of the entire
country. Suriname reached its decision at the urging of
Conservation International, an American environmental group that
has set up a private trust fund to help Suriname manage the area.
The group became actively involved in Suriname several years ago,
when Asian timber interests _ having pretty much stripped their own
countries of marketable hardwoods _ sought timber rights on 11
million acres of Suriname's forests. Suriname rejected that deal,
and has now put four million of these acres out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this decision so heartening is that Suriname is a
poor country that might normally have jumped at the quick profits
promised by foreign logging interests. Far richer nations like
Brazil have been unable to resist these blandishments, and Asian
timber interests are even now burrowing deeper into the Amazon rain
forest. At the other end of the economic scale, Guyana, Surname's
destitute neighbor, has opened up two-thirds of its forest mass to
foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
   Suriname chose the long-term economic value of forests over
short-term revenues from logging and other resource-depleting
activities. It hopes over time to make money from tourism generated
by the forest and its spectacular animal life, from non-timber
forest products like tannins and resins, and from
``bioprospecting'' _ the search for medicines among forest plants.
The National Institutes of Health and big pharmaceutical companies
like Bristol-Myers Squibb are already engaged in this search. This
avenue has been left unexplored by most of the world's governments,
which own 80 percent of the world's forests and which as a rule
cannot see beyond the next truckload of mahogany. The lure of
short-term gain is also the main reason various international
agreements, including the non-binding ``forest principles'' adopted
at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, have had zero impact.
</P>
<P>
   The larger point here is that a living forest is worth more than
a dead forest, locally and globally. Healthy forests prevent
erosion and water pollution. They also act as a natural ``sink''
for the carbon-based gases that contribute to global warming, and,
perhaps most important, they harbor at least half of all plant and
animal species, with enormous untapped benefits for human health.
</P>
<P>
   More than one-half of the world's original tropical forests have
now disappeared, mostly in this century. At present rates of
destruction, half of what is left could vanish in the next 50
years. This depressing prospect has not, however, inspired the
wealthier nations to act constructively. One of the few tangible
products of the 1992 Earth Summit was the Global Environmental
Facility, a multilateral body designed to persuade poor countries
to hang on to their natural assets, rain forests included. But the
United States, which pledged $435 million over five years, is $200
million in arrears.
</P>
<P>
   The task of saving the forests has thus been left to private
conservation groups, whose resources are limited. The very fact
that one of these groups and one small country have joined to save
four million acres might shame Western governments into broader
action.

THIS PREACHER'S PERSISTENCE NETS DIVINE FISH STORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By BOB HOOD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Church-goers in Woodville, Miss., likely will be hearing for
quite some time about their preacher stripping down to his shorts
and using his toes to maneuver a trophy largemouth bass into an
$18,000 bass tournament payout.
</P>
<P>
   That's the story and the amount of cash preacher Warren Whitaker
brought back to Mississippi last weekend after winning a Big Bass
Championship Series tournament at Lake Fork on what could be called
``a big tequila night.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker literally caught a 12.7-pound bass by the tail to sail
into the winner's seat of the $450,000 Texas Outdoor Adventure
Series tournament, but not before having to use his toes and feet
to free his line, which the fish had wrapped around a stump in
about 14 feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   It started when Whitaker cast a large tequila-colored plastic
worm into a stumpy area Saturday during the second day of the
three-day tournament. He felt the bass take the worm and set the
hook, only to have his line wrapped around a stump by the fish.
When he was unable to free it, he figured the only way he could get
to the fish would be to go in after it.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, bass fisherman J.D. Green of Tyler heard Whitaker scream
when he hooked the fish. ``He screamed so loud when he hooked the
fish I thought he was a hog caller,'' Green told tournament
officials.
</P>
<P>
   With Green holding onto Whitaker's boat, Whitaker stripped to
his shorts and went overboard, placing his line between his toes so
he could follow the line down to the fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared to go in,'' Whitaker said. ``I knew it was a big
fish and I knew I wasn't going to let her get away. You dream of
catching a fish that size.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker managed to loosen the line from the stump and got back
into his boat, but the ordeal was far from over. He suddenly
realized that the fish had wrapped the line around another stump.
So, he jumped back into the lake.
</P>
<P>
   Using his rod to grab the line, Whitaker said he felt the fish
bump against his foot. He then reached down, grabbed the bass by
the tail, pulled the fish toward his stomach and ``bear-hugged''
his catch up to the boat.
</P>
<P>
   The 12.7-pounder earned Whitaker the biggest prize of the
tournament, but it wasn't the only fish caught by Whitaker that
claimed a prize.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Whitaker caught a 7.71-pounder to win a $2,000 hourly
big-bass prize. The 12.7-pounder won an hourly prize Saturday
valued at more than $6,000 and then held up to claim the overall
championship during Sunday's final round, in which a 9.99-pounder
was the heaviest bass weighed.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker's winnings for the tournament totaled $18,299.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Whitaker isn't crediting his catch to luck.
``The good Lord was with me this weekend,'' Whitaker said.

3 METS IN MINORS WAIT, WAIT AND WAIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bill Pulsipher is frustrated. Jay Payton is back to
playing center field. And Paul Wilson is just trying to get back to
live games.
</P>
<P>
   Pulsipher, Payton and Wilson are arguably the three
highest-profile minor leaguers in the Mets organization. And each
is headed in a different direction.
</P>
<P>
   Pulsipher's current mood stems from the holding pattern he is in
at Class AAA Norfolk. The 24-year-old left-hander is 7-5 with a
3.96 earned run average for the Tides, but he has lost his last two
starts. He knows there is no room for him in the Mets' rotation
right now. But that does not alleviate any of the thoughts going
through his head.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Pulsipher has no chance for a call-up. The day after
trading for Hideo Nomo on June 4, Mets General Manager Steve
Phillips called Pulsipher to tell him that he would not rule out
promoting Pulsipher in a bullpen role. But that apparently did not
assuage Pulsipher's fears, because he and Phillips met in Norfolk
last week to talk again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't much of a change, and he is continually
frustrated by that,'' Jim Duquette, the Mets' director of player
personnel, said Saturday. ``Bill has these in and out phases. Some
days he can handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   The others are the tough ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a pretty good season,'' Duquette said. ``The majority
of his starts have been quality starts, which is what you'd expect
from him. He's had shaky defense behind him a couple of times, or
you see an outing where he has one bad inning and is then able to
settle down.''
</P>
<P>
   In 14 starts, Pulsipher has allowed 50 runs, 38 earned, and 91
hits in 86 1/3 innings. He has walked 41 and struck out 58. Lately,
his name has come up in trade rumors, but until a deal is made or
until the Mets beckon (and Mark Mimbs is the hottest left-hander in
Norfolk right now), Pulsipher will just have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, he is not known for his patience. ``All we can
do is try to maintain the positives with him,'' Duquette said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have no such problems with Payton, who returned last
Monday from an 18-day stay on the disabled list because of a pulled
right hamstring. Duquette said Payton is not playing first base
anymore. It is either left field, center field or designated
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as he stays healthy, we'll look at him in center
field,'' Duquette said. ``He's got pretty good speed. He's also
been hitting at the top of the order. So if he gets called up
again, he could be a lead-off center fielder.''
</P>
<P>
   First, though, Payton needs to strengthen his hamstrings. While
he was on the disabled list, an examination showed that his
hamstrings were significantly weaker than his quadriceps. And even
though Payton was put on a strengthening program immediately, he
felt something in the right hamstring earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We backed him off,'' Duquette said. ``We're basically being
real conservative with him.''
</P>
<P>
   That is because, at 25, Payton is the brightest offensive
prospect in the organization. After undergoing numerous elbow
surgeries that limited him to 71 minor-league games two seasons ago
and none last year, Payton is batting .255 with four home runs and
14 runs batted in, in 46 games with the Tides. He has 10 doubles,
three triples and 11 stolen bases. He has already been called up to
the Mets briefly this season, although he never actually appeared
in a game.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not a stretch to think Payton could be playing a
little center field for the Mets, maybe even by the end of this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Jay, and how much time he had off, you never know when
he's going to click with the bat,'' Duquette said. ``It's so
potent. And you can't put a ceiling on that. It wouldn't surprise
any of us if he got back to the big leagues. But we don't want to
put any pressure on him.''
</P>
<P>
   The most pleasant surprise of Payton's season thus far has been
his ability to play the outfield and make the throws. ``When we
mapped it out before the season, we looked at him thinking he would
play first base the entire year and maybe we could get him out to
the outfield,'' Duquette said. ``He has exceeded our
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   With Wilson, it is difficult to know what the expectations are
anymore. Since undergoing surgery on his right shoulder on Nov. 12,
1996, the big right-hander has pitched in just five games, all last
season, and all in the low-level minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   This year, after being set back by shoulder and elbow stiffness,
Wilson has finally progressed to the point where he can throw
batting practice, which he was scheduled to do for Todd Hundley
again Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we still expect him to be at Class AAA this year,''
Duquette said. ``He'll do live batting practice one or two more
times, then pitch in a simulated game. If everything goes as
expected, he could be pitching in game situations in a couple more
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   As Duquette said, the Mets are being extremely cautious with the
former No. 1 pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still sometimes feels not abnormal pain, but some stiffness
in the elbow, which is why we're being real cautious. But we still
have two and a half months. I don't think it's unrealistic to
expect he'll be at Class AAA at some point.''

   What's up? Is Wetteland an honors graduate of the Emily Post
School of Etiquette?
</P>
<P>
   Nah. It's just a part of that elusive quality that is commonly
known as chemistry. This isn't the kind of chemistry of elements
and periodic tables, or the kind of chemistry that results in
explosions when the wrong stuff is mixed together.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of science that can have some influence on how
a sports team plays on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Chemistry was cited as a major ingredient when the Rangers won
the West in 1996. Some of those players are gone, notably
designated hitter Mickey Tettleton, center fielder Darryl Hamilton
and third baseman Dean Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   But the chemistry apparently remains with this team. And that
chemistry will be called upon as the Rangers try to battle back
into first after losing their division lead to the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different players, a different mix,'' shortstop Kevin
Elster said. ``It's like I love Mexican food, I love salsa. But you
can't find two that taste the same. It's a different mix, but it's
still good. That's like it is here. It's a different mix, but it's
the same kind of feeling we had a couple of years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Better winning through chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the going gets tough, that's what makes a team stay
together,'' Rangers infielder Luis Alicea said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think Baltimore has it?'' Elster asked. ``Do they have
talent?''
</P>
<P>
   According to Elster, the answers are no. And yes.
</P>
<P>
   And the Rangers? Yes and yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah,'' Elster said.
</P>
<P>
   Team chemistry is kind of like the wind. Few can explain what it
is, or where it comes from, but you know when it's there and can
sense when it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what team chemistry is,'' Elster said. ``I can't
put my finger on it, I can't explain it. You either have it or you
don't. It's that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Like H2O, which assumes the shape and color of what it's poured
into, chemistry takes on many forms.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, it's how well the players work together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like watching Ellie (Elster) and Mac (Mark McLemore) at
shortstop and second base,'' Wetteland said. ``There's not a verbal
definition, but if you watch Ellie and Mac at short and second
you'll understand what chemistry is.''
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, it's how well the players get along.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to a certain point on the field,'' first
baseman Will Clark said. ``It's more important off the field. It's
more important how you get along with everybody on an everyday
basis for eight months.''
</P>
<P>
   There's some debate about which aspect of team chemistry is the
most important.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees of the 1970s were perceived as a
dysfunctional team. They didn't need a chemist, they needed a
psychiatrist. The clubhouse was immortalized by reliever Sparky
Lyle as ``the Bronx Zoo.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Yankees went to the World Series in 1977 and '78.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 25 guys that maybe off the field didn't pursue it, but
when they went on the field they had it,'' said Rangers bench coach
Bucky Dent, the shortstop on those Yankee teams. ``It's having
confidence when you go out there that you know you're going to win.
The teams that I played on, it seemed like always in September it
was 2-1, 1-0. You could not afford to lose your concentration,
because at certain times it could cost you the pennant. There was
that responsibility of staying in the game and not messing up.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland played on two teams with that kind of chemistry _ the
1994 Montreal Expos that had the best record in baseball when the
players went on strike and the '96 Yankees that won the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chemistry was there because everybody was very focused on
whatever it takes to be better every day, and on whatever it takes
to win the game that day,'' he said. ``It wasn't that we all went
out together and ate together and all that jazz; it had more to do
with everybody knew that the person sitting next to them had
prepared in order to beat their opponent. That type of chemistry is
the important chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   But also important is the chemistry of getting along well in the
clubhouse, of blending 25 players of different ages and from
different backgrounds and cultures in order to perform on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good thing about this ballclub is everybody is well liked
and everybody gets along, on the field and off the field,'' left
fielder Rusty Greer said. ``You have 25 people put together for
seven months. You spend more time with these guys than you do your
own family. You learn to get along. That's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't come naturally.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders such as Wetteland help make sure it happens. An example
is his complicated set of bullpen rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're everything from being impolite, and not saying thank
you and please, and not asking anyone if they'd like some water
before you get one, to a stupid question like what's the score when
you can look up at the scoreboard,'' Wetteland said. ``Yeah it's
silly, but there's a purpose to it all. When you take a head slap
for doing something stupid, the important thing is not that you got
punished. The important thing is that everybody gets a crack at
you, and everybody enjoys it. In the big picture it builds a
togetherness. After 162 games, guys have kept each other in every
ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules even apply before the game. That's why, even though
the game still was a couple of hours away, Levine asked Wetteland
if he wanted a cup of coffee, and why Wetteland was so polite in
accepting.
</P>
<P>
   The rules are designed to keep each other focused. But they
wouldn't work if the players didn't get along.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise with Alicea's good-natured barbs directed at teammates
who mess up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams that win have fun out there,'' Alicea said. ``They go
out and relax and have fun and let their ability take over. You can
get the most out of guys by joking around and saying things to
encourage them to play. Guys don't take it personally, and it seems
to work. That's the chemistry that this team has. We can get on
each other a little bit, and it doesn't get personal. It's fun.''
</P>
<P>
   If the players didn't like each other, off the field it could
turn into resentment and animosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everybody's on the same page, you've got chemistry,''
center fielder Tom Goodwin said. ``If not, you've got dissension
and more than likely you're not going to win a lot of ballgames.''

YANKS FIRST IN EVERYTHING BUT ALL-STAR FAN VOTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Joe Torre will be an American League coach at next
month's all-star game in Colorado, at the request of Mike Hargrove,
Cleveland's manager. But it may be that only a couple of Yankees
players join him, in spite of the team's staggering success the
first half of this season.
</P>
<P>
   No Yankee player is leading at his respective position in the
balloting of fans, although Derek Jeter has a chance to overtake
Alex Rodriguez among the shortstops. That would mean the Yankees'
representatives would have to be chosen with an at-large bid,
leaving them at the mercy of an imperfect system for selection.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams would have been a strong candidate to be picked,
but it may be that he won't be able to play again until after the
all-star game break. Paul O'Neill has hit well, and yet he doesn't
have the gaudy power numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch is among the league leaders in runs scored, but
he's hitting .273 and other second basemen, like Damion Easley of
Detroit, have much greater production. Jeter was the Yankees' best
player in the first two months but missed 15 days with an injury,
and Hargrove seems to be leaning to including his own shortstop,
Omar Vizquel, on the American League squad; that may or may not
leave room for a third shortstop, like Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone has nine victories and is averaging more than a
strikeout an inning, but his earned run average of 4.82 will hurt
his chances. David Wells is 8-2 and pitched a perfect game; he,
too, has a relatively high ERA (4.47) among all-star candidates.
Mariano Rivera, the Yankees' closer, has permitted just one walk in
20 appearances and has a 1.11 ERA, but because of an early-season
injury and the Yankees' extraordinary offense, four other AL
relievers have more saves than he. (Hargrove may give him extra
consideration because he regretted not picking Rivera in 1996, when
Rivera was a dominant middle reliever.)
</P>
<P>
   Hideki Irabu appears to be the Yankees' best pitching candidate,
bearing a league-best 1.68 ERA, and opponents have batted just .191
against him, also the best in the AL. Working against Irabu will be
his modest victory total of six (12 pitchers have eight or more
victories). Irabu will have a chance to make a case for selection
Sunday, when he pitches here against the Indians and Hargrove.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius, the Yankees' third baseman, may have the best
chance among the position players to be chosen. Cal Ripken Jr. of
Baltimore will be voted as the all-star starter at third base, but
Brosius is having perhaps the finest season of any American League
third baseman. Going into Saturday's game, Brosius was batting
.317, with 40 runs scored and 46 runs batted in, and he has
received increased recognition for his defense.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius plans to use the all-star game break to see the sights
of New York with his family, the Statue of Liberty and Ellis
Island, ``things they've read about,'' he said, referring to his
three children. Jennifer Brosius, his wife, is looking into buying
tickets to a show and hiring a baby sitter for a night during the
break.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to go out on a date,'' the infielder said
Saturday, while lounging on a couch in the visitors' clubhouse
here. ``But it would be a great recognition to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't have many guys there, it would say a lot about
this team _ that we've got a lot of people contributing, a lot of
people doing a real good job, to be playing this well,'' said
Brosius, who hasn't driven in more than 71 runs in any other
season, and who has never been an all-star.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove asked Torre to be his coach in 1996, but Torre declined
for family considerations. Later that season, Hargrove sent Torre
notes, telling him he was praying for his brother Frank, who
eventually needed a heart transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Torre asked Hargrove to coach last year, and Hargrove again
asked Torre this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still an honor to be there,'' said Torre, who has been an
all-star as a player, coach and manager.
</P>
<P>
   No Friends of Wright
</P>
<P>
   Jaret Wright angered the Yankees in spring training when he hit
Luis Sojo with a pitch, breaking his hand and spurring their belief
that he threw at Sojo intentionally. But Wright confirmed his place
on the Yankees' most hated enemies list Friday night, when he hit
Paul O'Neill with a pitch and then appeared to glare at the Yankee
outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill yelled at Wright as he walked to first base, with Umpire
John Shulock escorting him most of the way, to keep O'Neill calm.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, O'Neill said, ``After what he did to Luis, there
aren't a lot of good feelings in here.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no lingering bad blood between the teams, Torre said,
but Wright's actions bothered the Yankees. ``It looked like Jaret
was looking at him,'' Torre said. ``Normally, when you hit someone,
you go about your business, but he was staring at him.'' &QL;

MAVERICKS LOOK AT THE FOUR TOPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Mavericks seem to have a clear idea of how
Wednesday's NBA draft will transpire.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they could always get an intriguing late trade offer,
like the one last week from Milwaukee Bucks general manger Bob
Weinhauer, who was shopping former All-Star point guard Terrell
Brandon or one of two first-round picks for a move up the selection
ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as with Chris Anstey last year, they could pull a foreign
player out of the hat like 6-foot-11 German ``wunderkid'' Dirk
Nowitzki.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't believe anything you hear and rule nothing out,''
Mavericks general manager Don Nelson said. ``But I really think
this thing is becoming pretty clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring an unexpected trade or meteoric rise from a surprise
prospect such as Michigan's Robert Traylor, the Mavericks have
targeted their Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   They are planning to select either Saint Louis guard Larry
Hughes, Kansas forward Raef LaFrentz or one of two North Carolina
teammates, forward Antawn Jamison and guard Vince Carter, with
their No. 6 pick. Nelson brought only those four players in for
private workouts and seems content to add one of them _ most likely
Carter or LaFrentz _ to a team that last season went 20-62 and
missed the playoffs for a league-high eighth consecutive time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be happy with any of those four,'' he said. ``And it
looks like we'll get to decide between two of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not bad.''
</P>
<P>
   In what is becoming a consensus scenario among NBA personnel
types, Arizona guard Mike Bibby, Pacific center Michael Olowokandi
and Kansas forward Paul Pierce are expected to go 1-2-3 in some
order. That leaves the Mavericks third in line for the four players
that round out the draft's top tier. Hughes is one of the draft's
fastest risers and Jamison is considered a top-five pick, possibly
leaving Dallas with a choice between the athletic-but-raw Carter
and the polished-but-soft LaFrentz.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks, who also have the 30th, 35th and 53rd picks,
enter the draft seeking a pace-pushing point guard and a bulky
backup center. But as for the four players who could slide to No.
6: &QL; 
VINCE CARTER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 6-foot-7, 215 pounds and possessing an unmatched first step
and leaping ability, Carter was one of the nation's best finishers
as a junior last season. He averaged 15.6 points per game, but was
never forced to consistently knock down the open 15-footers he will
have to bury as an NBA shooting guard or small forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing on me was, can I hit a consistent jump shot?''
Carter said. ``That has become my main focus right now. Since we
lost to Utah (in the semifinals of the NCAA Tournament), I've been
back in the gym shooting the basketball, trying to get comfortable
again.''
</P>
<P>
   During workouts for Vancouver, Golden State, Denver and Dallas,
Carter impressed with his shooting form if not his results.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were going to make a film to teach youngsters how to
shoot, you'd use him as an example,'' Nuggets coach Dan Issel said.
``I would say it's real close between him and Pierce. He was that
impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Grizzlies player personnel director Larry Riley: ``When it
comes to running and jumping, Vince is probably the best in this
draft. If people were convinced that he could consistently make the
jump shot, they wouldn't be talking about four, five, six or seven,
they'd be talking about him at one, two or three.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Mavericks, Carter could play shooting guard, sliding
Michael Finley to small forward in case Nelson remains pessimistic
of re-signing free agent Cedric Ceballos. &QL; 
RAEF LaFRENTZ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 6-11, 235-pound senior is considered the best power-forward
prospect. A two-time first-team All-America selection and Big 12
player of the year, he has impressed scouts with his soft,
left-handed touch and array of low-post moves that led to 19.8
points and 11.4 rebounds last season.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't, however, considered strong enough _ or tough enough _
to immediately play center. That won't help his case with the
Mavericks, who already have ``soft'' centers in Shawn Bradley and
Chris Anstey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He runs the court, he scores, he rebounds and he blocks
shots,'' Boston Celtics general manager Chris Wallace said. ``But
he has to get stronger to meet the rigors of the NBA. His best
basketball won't come at center.''
</P>
<P>
   LaFrentz's stock has slipped recently, because scouts don't see
that something ``special'' in his game and they fear his potential
has already peaked. In addition, the Mavericks are already loaded
at power forward with Samaki Walker, Kurt Thomas and A.C. Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can play either position,'' LaFrentz said. ``I
played primarily with my back to the basket in college. I think
that is one area of my game that I can expand and become much
better. For a big man, I think that is one of my strengths to take
people out on the floor and be able to shoot it.'' &QL; 
ANTAWN JAMISON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 6-9 and 223 pounds, Jamison was simply too quick for college
forwards and averaged 22.2 points and 10.5 rebounds as a junior at
North Carolina last season. With pogo-stick jumping ability and a
cat-quick release on his shots, he was the nation's consensus
player of the year last season, joining only Michael Jordan as the
only Tar Heel to accomplish the feat.
</P>
<P>
   While scouts rave about his aggressiveness, agility and knack
for being in the right place at the right time, they're confused as
to whether Jamison is a small forward or power forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tremendous competitor and very athletic,'' said Gary
Wortman, director of scouting for the Atlanta Hawks. ``He has a
knack of getting off shots and getting to the free-throw line. But
he's more of a three (small forward), not strong enough for four
(power forward) right now.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Mavericks, Jamison could utilize his athleticism in
Nelson's up-tempo style and allow Finley to play his more natural
shooting guard position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most guys see what I did at Carolina and think that's all I
got,'' Jamison said. ``I played mostly inside, and I didn't have to
go outside and shoot the jump shot. I was doing a great job of
playing the post and scoring. I think a lot of teams are uncertain
on whether I can shoot from the outside. I really see myself as a
three and sometimes I can play the four.'' &QL; 
LARRY HUGHES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks have long coveted the 19-year-old since watching
him average 20.9 points as a 6-5 freshman shooting guard at Saint
Louis last season. Though he averaged only 2.4 assists, took almost
17 shots per game and shot only 41 percent (29 percent on
3-pointers), scouts drool over his quick first step, ball-handling
skills, unlimited shooting range and ability to create his own shot
off the dribble.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the tools to be a tremendous weapon as his shooting
improves,'' Wallace said. ``All the traits you want are there _
size, quickness, two-way skills. He could be something special.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, who scored 30 points seven times last season, could
eventually become the fast-breaking point guard Nelson desires. In
light of Robert Pack's injury-riddled season, Hughes would seem a
perfect fit in Dallas. Nelson, however, realizes the secret is out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody sees in him what we see,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State, picking No. 5, is also making no secret of its
infatuation with Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I fit in with anybody who likes to run, hit the open
court and finish,'' Hughes said. ``I'm an offensive player, but I
also enjoy shutting people down.''

FUTURE OF COLLEGIATE CONFERENCES COULD LIE IN NOTRE DAME'S
DECISION

<P>
   Time to play fantasy conference shuffling.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame joins the Big Ten (creating what, the Big Dozen?).
</P>
<P>
   The nine-team Atlantic Coast drafts three Big East teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific-10 reacts by inviting Colorado and a second team _
to be announced later _ to also reach 12.
</P>
<P>
   The Big 12 retains its status by admitting Arkansas, which has
watched its football program wither in the Southeastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC, which started the realignment raiding rage in 1992 when
it added Arkansas and South Carolina, finds itself standing in this
game of musical schools. To stay at 12, it has to invite a Big East
refugee or pluck an unripe school (Louisville?) from the expansion
vine.
</P>
<P>
   Fictional whimsy, you say? Perhaps. But the previous five
paragraphs are closer to fact than fantasy. Why? I've heard
off-the-record whispers from a variety of people who think the Big
Ten is ready to round out its membership to a dozen. And its
primary target is Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Big Ten officials shrugged off a story out of Ann
Arbor, Mich., that had Notre Dame joining their league. There will
be more stories and speculation, but we won't know for sure until a
news conference is called. When and if that happens, the conference
alignment dominoes will start falling.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Ten has been at 11 teams since Penn State joined in
1993. By adding a 12th team, the Big Ten could stage a conference
title game that could be worth $5 million to $7 million in
television rights fees.
</P>
<P>
   But isn't it preposterous that haughty Notre Dame, the school
with its own football network (NBC), would join any conference? Ten
years ago, did you think the possibility of the Southwest
Conference dissolving preposterous?
</P>
<P>
   Here's how and why the deal could go down:
</P>
<P>
   The Big Ten has made overtures to Notre Dame before. This time,
I hear, it's a Godfather offer. Take it or leave it, Irish, there
won't be another chance. The Big Ten is going to 12 no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   And if Notre Dame refuses, the Big Ten is prepared to invite
Syracuse from the Big East. That would begin the end of the Big
East, where Notre Dame has found a home for its sports other than
football.
</P>
<P>
   That's called leverage.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the second-tier bowls aligned with conference
tie-ins, Notre Dame is boxed out of the postseason if it fails to
earn a spot in one of the four Bowl Championship Series games. That
problem is solved if it joins the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame's membership in the Big East is jury-rigged; South
Bend, Ind., is not exactly ``east''. Ask the Western Athletic
Conference the importance of geography. If Notre Dame belongs in a
conference, it belongs in the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   (Quick aside on a juicy rumor: Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany
is considering emulating director James Cameron's King of the World
personna. He has talked casually of testing the limits of
expansion. 16 teams? 20? 28? 30? 32?)
</P>
<P>
   If the Big Ten domino falls, then watch the feeding frenzy. Word
is the ACC is eager to reach a dozen members and has its eye on
Syracuse, Boston College and either West Virginia or Miami of the
Big East. The Big East is on the endangered species list.
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10 will get to 12 by inviting Colorado, a school which
considered a Pac-10 offer in the Big 12's infancy. And the Pac-10's
12th school?
</P>
<P>
   BYU or Utah. Yes, either of the two leaders of the Western
Athletic Conference renegades would be a perfect fit; plus, the
Pac-10 has few other options if it wishes to expand.
</P>
<P>
   All the breakaway WAC schools have is the good word of their
eight fellow defectors, so BYU and Utah are free to cut a better
deal. There is no honor among thieves or conference shufflers.
</P>
<P>
   And no, the Big 12 wouldn't throw a lifeline to TCU or SMU to
become Colorado's replacement. With the SWC dead, Arkansas' escape
in 1992 has been erased from its permanent record. Arkansas would
be a geographic fit for the Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   Once the SEC drafts a 12th school, big-time college athletics
would be found in five 12-team conferences: ACC, Big Ten, SEC,
Pac-10 and Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   And there would again be peace in the collegiate valley. At
least until those five conferences get fed up with the NCAA's
meddling and decide to form their own association.
</P>
<P>
   But that's another fantasy. For now.

WHAT IS TENDEX?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TENDEX is a rating system originated in 1960 that blends 10
statistical categories into a formula to show the number of points
per minute a player is worth to his team.
</P>
<P>
   The formula regards each possession as worth about one point.
Everything that contributes to scoring and getting the ball
(points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks) is measured on the
plus side. Everything that results in loss of possession (missed
shots and turnovers) is a minus.
</P>
<P>
   After computing the statistics, adjustments are made based on
the pace of play and strength of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Game-pace rating is determined by considering all of the
statistics for a team and all of its opponents to come up with a
number that serves to balance the ratings of players on
high-scoring offensive teams with those of players on conservative
offensive teams.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's easier to rack up big statistics against weak
opponents, a strength-of-schedule factor is added to make all teams
equal.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a three-digit TENDEX rating, not unlike a batting
average in baseball. This is then given a plus or minus rating
comparing that player's rating to the average rating for that
position. The best players are the ones whose ratings are highest
above the positional average.
</P>
<P>
   The average ratings for college players are: center, .470; power
forward, .450; small forward, .390; point guard, .350 and shooting
guard, .340. Players with plus-200 ratings are considered lottery
material.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works using Oregon State shooting guard Corey
Benjamin's 1998 season as an example:
</P>
<P>
   Step 1: Add the plus statistics
</P>
<P>
   Points: 496
</P>
<P>
   Steals: 48
</P>
<P>
   Blocked shots: 17
</P>
<P>
   Assists: 56
</P>
<P>
   Rebounds: 125
</P>
<P>
   Positive total: 742
</P>
<P>
   Step 2: Add the minus statistics
</P>
<P>
   Field-goal attempts missed: 158
</P>
<P>
   Free-throw attempts missed: 39
</P>
<P>
   Turnovers: 69
</P>
<P>
   Neagative total: 266
</P>
<P>
   Step 3: Subtract 266 from 742 to get the pure stats of 476.
</P>
<P>
   Step 4: Divide pure stats minutes played (673) to get .7072808.
</P>
<P>
   Step 5: Figure Oregon State's team game-pace rating by computing
the pure stats total for the entire team and multiply that by .8,
which is .9111. Divide .7072808 from above by the team's game pace
(.9111) to get .7762932.
</P>
<P>
   Step 6: Figure Oregon State's strength-of-schedule rating by:
adding the conference rating for each opponent and dividing by the
number of games in the season. For example, say there are 30
conferences rated 1-30 and all opponents for that season are from
the Big 12, which is rated No. 1. That would be 30 divided by 30
games, which would be a strength of schedule rating of 1.000.
Oregon State's strength of schedule rating is 1.088. Divide
.7762932 from above, by the the strength of schedule rating (1.088)
to yield Benjamin's final TENDEX rating of .713.
</P>
<P>
   The final tally: Benjamin's plus-373 rating results from the
difference between his overall rating (.713) and the average rating
for a college shooting guard (.340).  &QL;

This list includes TENDEX ratings of players eligible for the 1998
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Players should have plus-100 ratings to be considered draftable
and they should be at least plus-200 to be considered lottery
material. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   College players should progress in their ratings each season.
Example: Ball State's Bonzi Wells had a .656-plus 266 as junior.
This year as a senior, he improved to .725-plus 335, an improvement
of 60 points. He's rated No. 10 on the TENDEX list.
</P>
<P>
   There are no TENDEX ratings for the four high school players
expected to be selected in the first round of the draft because
high school teams do not keep detailed statistics.

EDITORIAL: BIG MO AT LAST? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, June 21:
</P>
<P>
   The drive to clean up campaign finance _ dismissed as hopeless
by many a Beltway expert _ got a shot of adrenaline last week.
First, the House broke free of the Republican leadership, conducted
its first spirited debate on reform and blocked two attempts to
derail the Shays-Meehan bill. No less dramatic, nine former leaders
of the American Civil Liberties Union repudiated the organization's
wrongheaded view that the bill is unconstitutional. The reformers'
ranks are growing. It is likelier than ever that the bill can pass
in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional issue was at the center of the week's crucial
developments. The ACLU has warned that Shays-Meehan would violate
the Supreme Court's regrettable Buckley vs. Valeo decision. That
1976 ruling threw out the campaign spending limits imposed by the
post-Watergate campaign reform laws on free-speech grounds. By
equating spending with speech, the court has hobbled subsequent
efforts to clean up campaign finance. We have argued that neither
the Shays-Meehan ban on unlimited donations to political parties
nor its curbs of fund-raising for campaign ads run by independent
groups violate Buckley because they would curb fund-raising, not
spending. There have been limits on fund-raising since the ban on
corporate giving to candidates in 1907.
</P>
<P>
   Most lawmakers with strong records in civil liberties agree that
Shays-Meehan is constitutional. But many Republicans, eager to
preserve Congress' current system of influence-peddling, have cited
the constitutional concerns as a cover. Independent groups like the
National Right to Life Committee, which would have to limit
fund-raising for its attack ads, also cite First Amendment
concerns. By speaking out, the former ACLU leaders have blown away
that smokescreen.
</P>
<P>
   Given its history, of course, the Supreme Court could reject
some Shays-Meehan provisions. That is why it was important last
week to defeat a devious amendment advanced by opponents of the
bill. It would have nullified the entire bill if any part of it was
found to be unconstitutional. Thanks to a strong effort by Richard
Gephardt and David Bonior, the Democrats' leader and whip, almost
all Democrats voted no. They were joined by 65 Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Like the House's rejection of an attempt to substitute a study
commission for the real reforms of Shays-Meehan, the vote on Friday
demonstrated that dozens of Republicans are rebelling against House
Speaker Newt Gingrich's plan to position their party as the enemy
of clean campaigns. If these reform-minded Republicans now join
with the Democrats, Shays-Meehan will win. Opponents are running
out of tricks, and Gingrich henchmen like Rep. Tom DeLay are losing
their ability to intimidate GOP members. With a vote promised
before the August recess, this is a summer when lawmakers need to
hear from voters who want a Congress that is not on the take.

TENDEX: RATING THE NBA DRAFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Oregon State sophomore Corey Benjamin won't be the No. 1
selection in Wednesday's NBA draft. He might not even be a lottery
pick.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin, though, might very well be the surprise of the draft
with a .713 TENDEX rating, 373 points higher than the average
rating for a college shooting guard (.340). The past two college
guards to have ratings comparable to Benjamin's were Penny Hardaway
and Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin, a 6-foot-6 shooting guard who averaged 19.5 points and
5.0 rebounds a game while shooting 54 percent from the field, was
one of four Pacific-10 Conference players to lead their teams in
scoring and rebounds in the 1997-98 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corey does things athletically that wow you, things you don't
see very often,'' Oregon State coach Eddie Payne said. ``He has the
potential to be a great pro.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Mavericks director of player personnel Keith Grant,
whose team has the No. 6 overall pick, said Benjamin is not
considered one of the elite players in the draft. Grant cites
Benjamin's relative inexperience and his 29- percent shooting from
3-point distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very talented, but he's more of an athlete than a
basketball player,'' Grant said. ``He could go as high as No. 8 or
as low as No. 25.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin replaced Utah's Andre Miller as the TENDEX No. 1 pick
after Miller elected to return to the Utes for his senior year.
Miller is the projected No. 1 pick on the 1999 TENDEX draft list.
</P>
<P>
   TENDEX ranks Benjamin, Pacific center Michael Olowokandi and
North Carolina guard Vince Carter as the top three choices in this
year's draft. Meanwhile, NBA scouts include Arizona guard Mike
Bibby, Olowokandi and Kansas swingman Paul Pierce among the first
three selections.
</P>
<P>
   Other players rated by TENDEX to be high first-round selections
this year include Iowa small forward Ryan Bowen, Georgetown power
forward Jahidi White, and Northwestern center Evan Eschmeyer. All
three players are projected by NBA scouts to be no better than
second-round picks.

EDITORIAL: BIG MO AT LAST?  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, June 20:
</P>
<P>
   The drive to clean up campaign finance _ dismissed as hopeless
by many a Beltway expert _ got a shot of adrenaline last week.
First, the House broke free of the Republican leadership, conducted
its first spirited debate on reform, and blocked two attempts to
derail the Shays-Meehan bill. No less dramatic, nine former leaders
of the American Civil Liberties Union repudiated the organization's
wrongheaded view that the bill is unconstitutional. The reformers'
ranks are growing. It is likelier than ever that the bill can pass
in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional issue was at the center of the week's crucial
developments. The ACLU has warned that Shays-Meehan would violate
the Supreme Court's regrettable Buckley vs. Valeo decision. That
1976 ruling threw out the campaign spending limits imposed by the
post-Watergate campaign reform laws on free-speech grounds. By
equating spending with speech, the court has hobbled subsequent
efforts to clean up campaign finance. We have argued that neither
the Shays-Meehan ban on unlimited donations to political parties
nor its curbs of fund-raising for campaign ads run by independent
groups violate Buckley because they would curb fund-raising, not
spending. There have been limits on fund-raising since the ban on
corporate giving to candidates in 1907.
</P>
<P>
   Most lawmakers with strong records in civil liberties agree that
Shays-Meehan is constitutional. But many Republicans, eager to
preserve Congress' current system of influence-peddling, have cited
the constitutional concerns as a cover. Independent groups like the
National Right to Life Committee, which would have to limit
fund-raising for its attack ads, also cite First Amendment
concerns. By speaking out, the former ACLU leaders have blown away
that smokescreen.
</P>
<P>
   Given its history, of course, the Supreme Court could reject
some Shays-Meehan provisions. That is why it was important last
week to defeat a devious amendment advanced by opponents of the
bill. It would have nullified the entire bill if any part of it was
found to be unconstitutional. Thanks to a strong effort by Dick
Gephardt and David Bonior, the Democrats' leader and whip, almost
all Democrats voted no. They were joined by 65 Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Like the House's rejection of an attempt to substitute a study
commission for the real reforms of Shays-Meehan, the vote on Friday
demonstrated that dozens of Republicans are rebelling against House
Speaker Newt Gingrich's plan to position their party as the enemy
of clean campaigns. If these reform-minded Republicans now join
with the Democrats, Shays-Meehan will win. Opponents are running
out of tricks, and Gingrich henchmen like Rep. Tom DeLay are losing
their ability to intimidate GOP members. With a vote promised
before the August recess, this is a summer when lawmakers need to
hear from voters who want a Congress that is not on the take.

WHAT IS TENDEX?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TENDEX is a rating system originated in 1960 that blends 10
statistical categories into a formula to show the number of points
per minute a player is worth to his team.
</P>
<P>
   The formula regards each possession as worth about one point.
Everything that contributes to scoring and getting the ball
(points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks) is measured on the
plus side. Everything that results in loss of possession (missed
shots and turnovers) is a minus.
</P>
<P>
   After computing the statistics, adjustments are made based on
the pace of play and strength of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Game-pace rating is determined by considering all of the
statistics for a team and all of its opponents to come up with a
number that serves to balance the ratings of players on
high-scoring offensive teams with those of players on conservative
offensive teams.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's easier to rack up big statistics against weak
opponents, a strength-of-schedule factor is added to make all teams
equal.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a three-digit TENDEX rating, not unlike a batting
average in baseball. This is then given a plus or minus rating
comparing that player's rating to the average rating for that
position. The best players are the ones whose ratings are highest
above the positional average.
</P>
<P>
   The average ratings for college players are: center, .470; power
forward, .450; small forward, .390; point guard, .350 and shooting
guard, .340. Players with plus-200 ratings are considered lottery
material.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works using Oregon State shooting guard Corey
Benjamin's 1998 season as an example: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Step 1: Add the plus statistics &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Points: 496 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steals: 48 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blocked shots: 17 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Assists: 56 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rebounds: 125 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Positive total: 742 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Step 2: Add the minus statistics &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Field-goal attempts missed: 158 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Free-throw attempts missed: 39 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Turnovers: 69 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neagative total: 266 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Step 3: Subtract 266 from 742 to get the pure stats of 476. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Step 4: Divide pure stats minutes played (673) to get .7072808. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Step 5: Figure Oregon State's team game-pace rating by computing
the pure stats total for the entire team and multiply that by .8,
which is .9111. Divide .7072808 from above by the team's game pace
(.9111) to get .7762932. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Step 6: Figure Oregon State's strength-of-schedule rating by:
adding the conference rating for each opponent and dividing by the
number of games in the season. For example, say there are 30
conferences rated 1-30 and all opponents for that season are from
the Big 12, which is rated No. 1. That would be 30 divided by 30
games, which would be a strength of schedule rating of 1.000.
Oregon State's strength of schedule rating is 1.088. Divide
.7762932 from above, by the the strength of schedule rating (1.088)
to yield Benjamin's final TENDEX rating of .713. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The final tally: Benjamin's plus-373 rating results from the
difference between his overall rating (.713) and the average rating
for a college shooting guard (.340).  &QL;

1998 TENDEX Draft List &QL; 
This list includes TENDEX ratings of players eligible for the 1998
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Players should have plus-100 ratings to be considered draftable
and they should be at least plus-200 to be considered lottery
material. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   College players should progress in their ratings each season.
Example: Ball State's Bonzi Wells had a .656-plus 266 as junior.
This year as a senior, he improved to .725-plus 335, an improvement
of 60 points. He's rated No. 10 on the TENDEX list. &QL;

Pittsburgh force say the skills women bring to the job add vital
components to policing. ``I think adding women to the force has
helped make the men more sensitive. They hate to hear that they are

Commander Bryant joined the force, when ``the idea of having a

in a housing project and saw police officers as people to be
feared, concedes that old ways die hard among some officers. ``When
you have to discipline a male officer, with white guys you usually
see a level of red in their face, and with black guys, you see them
tense their jaw muscles. It's interesting to watch,'' she says.

<HEADLINE>
EDITORIAL OBSERVER: A GENTLER BREEZE IS BLOWING THROUGH MOSCOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By PHILIP TAUBMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The warmth and lingering daylight of a Moscow summer
could make even the harshest periods of Soviet rule seem less
demented. The appearance of flowers and fresh fruits and vegetables
in barren markets temporarily lifted the city's spirits, creating
the illusion that this was just another European capital marking
time until the August holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is no longer an illusion. Moscow may not be Paris or
Rome, but it is no longer a world apart. The differences of dress,
demeanor and politics that made Moscow so distinctively depressing
have melted away. From its monumental traffic jams to its
supermarkets, boutiques and elegant restaurants, Moscow is a big,
bustling, brash metropolis exploding with energy and
entrepreneurial activity.
</P>
<P>
   To see the city again after an absence of three years, and to
compare it to the Soviet citadel of 10 years ago where I worked as
a correspondent, is to appreciate anew how far Russia has traveled
since the demise of Communism. The economy is shaky, corruption is
ubiquitous and the power of the wealthiest bankers and businessmen
remains largely unchecked, but these and other deformities should
not overshadow the political and economic changes that have
transformed Russia in just a few years. Almost as swiftly as the
1917 Bolshevik Revolution sealed Russia in hermetic isolation, the
arrival of democracy and capitalism have set it free and tied it to
the West, culturally and economically.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow is the epicenter of change, and the locus of wealth, in
the new Russia. It will be some time before the rest of the
country, including St. Petersburg, comes anywhere close to matching
the standard of living now enjoyed by many Muscovites.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best seats for observing the new Russia is on the
terrace outside the cavernous McDonald's at Pushkin Square. Though
the novelty of Big Macs has faded, the restaurant still has cachet
with Russians and serves as a mecca for affluent young Muscovites.
They arrive in Jeep Cherokees and Toyota Land Cruisers, cell phones
in hand. The men are dressed nattily in light-weight pleated
trousers, colorful sport shirts and tasseled loafers, the women in
short skirts, tight tops and stylish Italian shoes. The scene seems
almost unimaginable to someone who lived here a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The McDonald's also attracts working-class customers who have
become indistinguishable in appearance from their counterparts in
London or New York. The nondescript Soviet wardrobe has almost
entirely vanished, replaced by jeans, colorful outfits and Nike or
Reebok shoes. Even eyeglasses and sunglasses are sleek. After
decades of enforced conformity in everything from clothing to
politics, Russians have seized the chance to assert their
individuality.
</P>
<P>
   Across from the McDonald's is a small plaza that is part of the
boulevard that circles central Moscow. Once a cheerless place with
a few scruffy benches and an expanse of dirt, it is now the site of
a leafy beer garden where people congregate after work, engaging in
easy conversation as the daylight stretches far into the evening.
The talk is of business and politics, romance and vacation plans.
The fear that once permeated Moscow and made it so inhospitable to
such gatherings is gone.
</P>
<P>
   The press is full of lively debate and invective, the television
news a cascade of irreverent reports. Even more remarkable is the
Internet, where information of all kinds is available about the
government and the economy. Where implacable customs agents once
enforced Soviet censorship at Sheremetyevo airport, there is now an
unobstructed ``green channel'' for passengers with nothing to
declare.
</P>
<P>
   The new Russia is an unfinished work. It is a land that favors
the young and those unbroken by Communism and has little patience
or compassion for those unable to adapt. But Moscow, at least, is
increasingly a city where people can enjoy life. Considering its
history, that is no mean feat.

   (NYT8) NEW YORK -- June 20, 1998 -- NY-CENTENNIAL, 6-20 -- Penny
whistles and push carts helping to give Orchard Street between
Delancey and Broome Streets in Manhattan the look of an 1898
neighborhood. The street scene is part of the commemoration of the
consolidation of five boroughs into New York City. The actual
anniversary of the city's consolidation was on New Year's Day, but
organizers thought the summer's first weekend would provide a
natural opportunity to herald both history and summer weather.

opera star who now lives in New York. Chinese performers often have
to adjust to an austere life in the United States. Unlike many
artists from Western countries whose celebrity follows them here,
performers from China find themselves plunged into the austere
world of new Chinese immigrants, a world of menial jobs, Spartan
housing and little contact beyond the immigrant community. (Chang

colleague, Chen Zhiping, in a video store in New York. Cai and Ms.
Shi, are both former members of Shanghai's celebrated Kunqu Theater
Troupe. For many Chinese, the sight of Shi Jiehua shelving
videotapes or Cai Qingling delivering takeout food is akin to the
notion of Luciano Pavarotti scrubbing pots at a pasta joint in
Little Italy. But virtually no Chinese opera star in this country
can survive on performing and teaching alone. (Chang W. Lee/New

Today, Robert Bennett is President Clinton's personal lawyer, and
William Bennett is a conservative author of books such as ``The
Book of Virtues.'' Each brother says he respects the other's right

between these two prominent men, brothers who sometimes seem to
agree on little more than the appeal of a good steak, is a matter
of intense interest in Washington. (New York Times Photo)

   (NYT4) PITTSBURGH -- June 20, 1998 -- PITTSBURGH-POLICE-2, 6-20
-- Linda Rosato-Barone, 40, is one of 14 commanders on the
Pittsburgh police force. Commander Barone and other women on the
Pittsburgh force say the skills women bring to the job add vital
components to policing. ``I think adding women to the force has
helped make the men more sensitive. They hate to hear that they are
becoming touchy-feely; they prefer the image of tough and strong. I
beg to differ,'' says Commander Barone, who joined the force in
1979. ``They're human beings like everyone else.'' (Terry Clark/New

   (NYT3) PITTSBURGH -- June 20, 1998 -- SUB-PITTSBURGH-POLICE-1,
6-20 -- Comdr. Maurita Bryant, 45, talking with Sgt. James O'Brien,
runs a police district in Pittsburgh with the highest crime rate.
Commander Bryant joined the force, when ``the idea of having a
female supervisor was unheard of.'' Commander Bryant, who grew up
in a housing project and saw police officers as people to be
feared, concedes that old ways die hard among some officers. ``When
you have to discipline a male officer, with white guys you usually
see a level of red in their face, and with black guys, you see them
tense their jaw muscles. It's interesting to watch,'' she says.

   (NYT2) SPRINFILED, Pa. -- June 20, 1998 -- FINANCIAL-AID-EDUC,
6-20 -- James Doyle of Springfield, Pa., at home, has accepted an
offer to attend Princeton University, which changed its formula for
determining financial aid. Under the old formula, Princeton would
have been financially out of reach for his father, a retired
teacher. The once orderly world of financial aid, where colleges
avoided bidding against each other and standards of need were well
established, is unraveling, replaced by a more competitive
environment. (Sal Dimarco/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT1) GAFFNEY, S.C. -- June 20, 1998 -- SUMMER-JOBS, 6-20 --
Sharai Correll, an 18-year old premed student, is working this
summer as a sales clerk at Fila, a shoe and sportswear retailer.
Ms. Correll is amazed at the leverage she and friends command this
year in the market for summer work. ``Five jobs in two days!'' she
exclaims. In many places around the country, tight job markets mean
youth unemployment is at its lowest point in a decade. (Nancy

   FULTON, Mo. _ of Japanese shrapnel.
</P>
<P>
   When the wounded Havrum returned from the battlefront, Helen
Havrum was waiting. They had married in 1943, before he went to
war. He was 17 and she was 16.
</P>
<P>
   Elzie Havrum worked as a laborer and lift operator at a brick
factory in Fulton for almost 40 years and also ran an auction
business out of a barn behind his house.
</P>
<P>
   After Havrum died on June 15, 1992, more than 260 people
attended his funeral, according to a registration book his family
kept.
</P>
<P>
   But when he was buried that day, it was not for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1993, two FBI agents called on Helen Havrum and asked
her to sign forms permitting them to exhume her husband's body as
part of an investigation of deaths at Ward Four East.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you now, your husband did not die from his
illness,'' one of the agents told Havrum, according to her
deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Havrum's body was one of 13 the FBI wanted to exhume.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, ``just let him rest,'' Havrum said in the deposition.
But the agents persuaded her to agree.
</P>
<P>
   The exhumation in March reminded Havrum of that sorrowful night
nine months earlier when she saw her husband alive for the last
time.
</P>
<P>
   Elzie Havrum had been sick often. Years of smoking when he was
younger and many more years of working in the dusty brick factory
contributed to bouts of asthma and emphysema.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of June 14, Elzie Havrum told his wife he needed
to go to the hospital because he couldn't catch his breath. He had
spent three days there a week earlier for similar problems.
</P>
<P>
   By evening, he was in a hospital room sitting up, eating and
talking to visitors, his wife recalled.
</P>
<P>
   About 11:30 p.m., Havrum received two Tylenol 3 tablets, which
contain codeine, for his bad back. Helen Havrum stayed with him
until about midnight and then went home.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents gathered for Havrum's lawsuit, nurse
Williams checked on Havrum at 1 a.m. When he went to the room again
at 1:10 a.m., he found Havrum in ``severe respiratory distress,''
according to his notes.
</P>
<P>
   Williams summoned the doctor on duty but did not call a Code
Blue, which would have brought in a team of emergency medical
personnel. Williams did nothing to help Havrum until the doctor
arrived at 1:15 a.m., the lawsuit says.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor, Malti Gohel, said in her notes she found Havrum with
no pulse, heartbeat or blood pressure, and she pronounced him dead.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Havrum was stunned when Gohel called to say her husband
had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have stayed all night had we thought anything like
that,'' she stated in her deposition. ``We didn't think it was that
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did the doctors. Muthu Krishnan, the doctor who admitted
Havrum, said he was in stable condition, but didn't need intensive
care. In his deposition, Krishnan said Havrum had a lung disorder,
rapid breathing, swelling of the legs and feet and a blue tint to
his tongue and extremities.
</P>
<P>
   The death certificate listed his cause of death as chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.
</P>
<P>
   There was no autopsy until his body was exhumed nine months
later.
</P>
<P>
   Toxicologists and other experts hired by Havrum and the
government sharply disagree on whether his body contained a toxic
amount of codeine.
</P>
<P>
   When Havrum's body was exhumed, tests ordered by the FBI
indicated that his liver contained about six times the amount of
codeine considered to be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy did not indicate whether the codeine was given by
injection or in pills. Christensen estimated it would take 20 pills
to reach that codeine level.
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy showed needle marks in Havrum's left buttock and
left elbow, but found no codeine residue. The lawsuit said hospital
records report only a shot to the elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Government experts later re-tested samples from Havrum's body
and concluded that earlier tests were misleading. Their follow-up
study indicated he had the equivalent of about two Tylenol 3s in
his system.
</P>
<P>
   Further, they said someone dying of a codeine overdose would
deteriorate over a few hours rather than going into respiratory
failure so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the government has backed off its view that Havrum
died suspiciously, Helen Havrum believes it more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Halsey, a Havrum friend, says Havrum deserves some answers
about her husband's death and is entitled to compensation for her
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, someone gave Elzie the wrong medicine or gave
him a shot of something in his vein,'' Halsey said. ``I think
whatever she gets, she deserves every dime of it. She lost a
husband.''

VETERAN'S WIDOW SUES U.S. OVER HUSBAND'S SUSPICIOUS DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FULTON, Mo. _ A tiny American flag flutters next to the bright
silk flowers marking Elzie Havrum's grave.
</P>
<P>
   It's a peaceful spot, but Havrum doesn't rest in peace.
</P>
<P>
   When Havrum died six years ago at the Truman Memorial Veterans
Hospital in Columbia, Mo., at age 66, his wife assumed the cause
was natural.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, Helen Havrum suspected murder.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, the 71-year-old widow, who has never set foot in a
courtroom, puts the United States on trial in a wrongful death
lawsuit that alleges negligence and malpractice at the
government-owned hospital. She seeks unspecified damages.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Havrum claims her husband died at the hands of a nurse the
FBI investigated but never charged in 33 suspicious deaths at the
hospital. Havrum alleges a codeine overdose killed her husband.
</P>
<P>
   The government wanted the 1995 lawsuit dismissed, saying Havrum
lacks evidence and waited too long to file. But U.S. District Judge
Nanette K. Laughrey of Kansas City denied the motion Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Havrum will get her day in court _ at long last.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Havrum's struggle should not be stopped now,'' her Kansas
City attorney, John Kurtz, wrote in arguing against dismissal.
``She is entitled under the law to a trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The Havrum trial will be the fullest public exploration of any
of the 33 suspicious deaths, said Gordon Christensen, a doctor at
the veterans' hospital who called public attention to the series of
deaths in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's necessary at this point to resolve the questions in
people's minds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of one other veteran filed a lawsuit in St. Louis, but
a judge dismissed it last year, saying it missed the statute of
limitations deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI investigated the Ward Four East deaths for more than
five years before declaring in January it could not prove a crime,
although it called 11 of the deaths ``highly suspicious'' and 22
``moderately suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients were 10 times more likely to die while nurse Richard A.
Williams was on duty, according to an analysis by Christensen. No
similar pattern emerged for other nurses or medical personnel at
the hospital, he found.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 55 persons who died in the ward between March 8 and Aug.
22, 1992, 45 died while Williams was on duty, hospital records
show.
</P>
<P>
   Williams denied responsibility at the time, telling KOMU-TV in
Columbia: ``I didn't become a nurse to mercy kill or to determine
when someone would die.''
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit, Havrum faults the hospital for hiring Williams
after he had been fired from a job in Springfield, Mo., for failing
to give prescribed medicine and falsifying records.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Havrum said the hospital was negligent to keep Williams
on duty after more than 30 patients died unexpectedly on his watch
between March and June of 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was not told of the hospital's dreadful, long-held
knowledge regarding the nurse who was in the room when her husband
died,'' the lawsuit states.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1992, nurses had begun noticing the frequency of deaths
on Ward Four East while Williams was on duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one morning he said, `I took another three out last
night,' '' said nurse Joan Kollenberg in a deposition. She said she
never heard any other nurse speak of the deaths that way.
</P>
<P>
   Nurses discussed the pattern of deaths with supervisors in April
and for several more months before action was taken, the lawsuit
said.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital assigned another nurse to work with Williams in
August. But twice during the next week, when the other nurse called
in sick, patients of Williams died.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was then transferred out of patient care, and he quit
the hospital in December 1993. He took a job at the Ashland
Healthcare nursing home in Ashland, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 32, has since moved from job to job in the St. Louis
area. He would not comment Friday but told a reporter last year he
didn't give Havrum any unauthorized medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Helen Havrum is anxious about the start of the
federal trial, scheduled to begin July 27 in Jefferson City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's nervous and she's worried about how long it's going to
take,'' said Wilma Salmons, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz declined to let a reporter interview Havrum or her three
children. Christensen said he can imagine the pain waiting has
caused Havrum's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delayed grief is one of the worst kinds of grief,''
Christensen said. ``They can't put closure on the death of a loved
one. It carries on and on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   At her house on the outskirts of Fulton, Helen Havrum is
literally surrounded by memories of her husband. He built the house
himself 32 years ago, and the tidy living room is filled with
pictures of him with his wife, children and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Havrum stows some of her husband's belongings in a plastic
sandwich bag: his worn leather wallet, his watch, a jackknife, two
pocket tape measures, even a car wash token.
</P>
<P>
   In a little felt-lined case, she keeps the Purple Heart he
received during World War II in the Philippines. A skinny teen-ager
when he went to war, Havrum had his service end when he took a
faceful of Japanese shrapnel. MORE

CALLAWAY DID GOLF A GREAT SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED _ When Callaway Golf Co. last month stood up for its
marketplace rights, it provided a valuable lesson for all
businesses threatened by regulatory ambition.
</P>
<P>
   Callaway also helped the business of golf avert a disastrous
clash with the game's stewards. The last thing the game and the
industry needed was a fight between equipment manufacturers and the
game's ruling authority just as golf is poised for a new era of
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most American enterprises, those in the golf business
aren't as worried about government regulators as they are about the
U.S. Golf Association, which is to golf what the Financial
Accounting Standards Board is to accounting.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz in golf circles in recent months was that USGA fears
about high-tech equipment making golf too easy would soon result in
a regulatory squeeze play. Topping the rumor list was a prohibition
on over-sized titanium drivers of the type pioneered by the folks
at Callaway. Another rumor was that the number of clubs allowed for
play would be reduced from 14 to 12, which was perhaps the most
frightening prospect for most equipment makers.
</P>
<P>
   The claim that golf is becoming too easy likely seems fatuous to
anyone familiar with the game. Callaway, however, opted not to
depend entirely on common sense and intuition to guide the debate.
Rather, it took an industry leadership role by purchasing ads in
major publications to explain why the rumored concerns of the USGA
were groundless.
</P>
<P>
   Pertinent points included in these ads were the fact that
handicaps for average golfers have remained about the same for a
generation while scoring on the pro tour hasn't been improved
appreciably by high-tech weapons. Byron Nelson's record
single-season scoring average, Callaway noted, has remained
unbroken for more than a half a century.
</P>
<P>
   The Callaway ad, though, didn't get into golf's centuries-old
evolution. Golf began as a primitive pastime using wooden-shafted
clubs to hit balls stuffed with feathers around grazing lands.
Today's equipment and courses approach a perfection made possible
by modern science and agronomy. Nevertheless, golf remains probably
the most difficult to master of all the games ever created.
</P>
<P>
   Callaway's challenge to the game's clubby mandarins no doubt
helped carry the day, because none of the worst of what was feared
came to pass. When the USGA used this year's U.S. Open tournament
as the forum to announce its much-feared equipment rules changes,
it opted mainly for the status quo. Equipment currently available
apparently will remain so, and the USGA will merely continue to
study new developments with an eye on preserving the game's
integrity.
</P>
<P>
   It was both a wise and politic decision because a radical rules
revamping would have created a bifurcated game. Many weekend
golfers would have ignored any ban on game-improvement clubs, which
would have undercut the USGA's ability to rule. Meanwhile,
manufacturers would have buried the USGA in lawsuits, further
debilitating the game's governing authority.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Callaway has done golf a great service by standing
up for the rights of the game's devotees against overarching
regulators. By helping to convince the USGA to back off its power
trip, it also did the association a favor, whether the USGA
realizes it or not. And last but not least, it provided business a
lesson in how to defend its rights from misguided meddlers, both
private and public.

REAL ESTATE: TRUMP LINKS UP IN WESTCHESTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MARY McALEER VIZARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since entering the Westchester County market in 1995, Donald
Trump has proposed three golf-course projects. He now may make a
fourth proposal, for property he recently purchased along the
border with Putnam County.
</P>
<P>
   This is Trump's first foray into Putnam County, where on June 10
he paid $1.75 million for 265 acres of rolling hills off Indian
Hill Road in the town of Putnam Valley. A small portion of the
property, about 30 acres, is in Yorktown. The land had been in
foreclosure and was taken over by Bankers Trust Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no specific plans for it yet, it's too early,'' Trump
said. ``We don't know whether it will be just a golf course or golf
plus residential.''
</P>
<P>
   The four Trump development projects make him the leading
developer of new courses within the region, which he believes has a
powerful appetite for new courses, especially those of championship
caliber. But while his Westchester proposals percolate through the
public approval process, others also are developing or improving
courses in the region.
</P>
<P>
   In Carmel, in Putnam County, an 18-hole course at the privately
owned Centennial club opened May 22 and is available to the public.
The greens fee is $65 Tuesday through Thursday, including golf
cart, and $85 Friday through Sunday. Nine additional holes are
expected to be ready for play in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   In West Nyack, in Rockland County, the Manhattan Woods Golf Club
is expected to open in July, with play limited to members.
</P>
<P>
   Several existing clubs are busy sprucing up to hold their
position in the midst of all the new competition. The Ridgeway Golf
Course, a private club in White Plains, for example, is embarking
on a $3.5 million renovation of its clubhouse, expanding its dining
room, installing a new kitchen and upgrading locker-room
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Mahopac Golf Club, in Putnam County, is celebrating its
centennial by refurbishing its 11-year-old grill room. ``It's
getting all new wallpaper, furniture and light fixtures,'' said
Howard Kelly, the general manager. All the design detailing will
involve golf themes, Kelly said. ``Previously it was pretty
generic,'' he said. ``Now it will be more esthetically pleasing
with more of a golfer's type atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the club will redo its ballroom. ``It's a constant
process of renovation and improvement,'' Kelly said. ``Our members
vote for these improvements. To attract new members and keep up
with the times, it's important to keep changing.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a total of 50 golf courses in Westchester County.
Seven are open to the public and the rest are private.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason more courses aren't developed is that land is so
scarce,'' Trump said. ``In Westchester in particular land is at a
premium. But once you acquire a large piece of property, you
realize that what people want is more golf courses, rather than a
bunch of houses.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Trump planned to build a golf course in New Castle
on land owned by International Business Machines. But that idea was
dropped when the county acquired the land to build its sixth public
course. The county will soon send out a request for proposals to
find a developer for the project.
</P>
<P>
   In Putnam Valley, where Trump bought the 265 acres off Indian
Hill Road, there have long been rumors that he wanted to build an
upscale mall. He acknowledges that he was approached by a local
developer about such a project, but said that he was not
interested.
</P>
<P>
   He did say he was negotiating with the New York state Department
of Transportation to buy an additional 58 acres that would bring
his property to the border of the Taconic State Parkway. Purdy
Halstead, the department spokesman, confirmed that the state had
agreed to sell Trump the land, but added that access to the Taconic
would not be granted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Prior to his latest acquisition, Trump purchased 150 acres along
the Taconic State Parkway in the French Hill section of Yorktown,
which he also plans to turn into a golf course. Linda Cooper,
supervisor of the town of Yorktown, said the town was
``supportive'' of his plans. The company is working on an
environmental impact statement, Ms. Cooper said. ``It's just a
matter of being careful about the key issues of local water supply,
impact on the reservoir and ingress and egress near the Taconic.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump entered the county's real estate market in 1995 when he
agreed to purchase Davids Island in New Rochelle. He planned to
turn the abandoned Army post into a luxury residential complex.
</P>
<P>
   After that deal fell through, he bought the 213-acre Seven
Springs estate, which straddles the Towns of Bedford, New Castle
and North Castle. The estate was originally owned by Eugene Meyer,
an industrialist who owned The Washington Post. His daughter,
Katharine Graham, to whom he left the newspaper and estate, was
married there in 1940. The estate's most recent owner was
Rockefeller University.
</P>
<P>
   Trump plans to convert the estate into a golf course and build
10 mansions, he said, and a 38,000-square-foot limestone mansion,
built in 1917, will be converted into a clubhouse. It will include
three dining rooms, a bar and lounge and men's and women's locker
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Any development at Seven Springs will first have to be approved
by a co-lead agency consisting of representatives of all three
towns. ``We expect approvals for Seven Springs to be a three-year
process, and we're already two years in,'' Trump said. ``We have
another 12 months to go and we should be ready to start
construction.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trump project furthest along in the approval process is the
reconstruction of the Briar Hall Country Club in Briarcliff Manor.
Trump purchased the property and adjacent parcels around it _ a
total of 146.5 acres _in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be the equivalent of Winged Foot,'' he said, referring
to the Mamaroneck club of which he is a member. The club hosted the
PGA Championship last year.
</P>
<P>
   Trump plans to build 87 residential units in Briarcliff Manor,
30 of which will be in a four-story building adjacent to the
clubhouse. The remaining residences will be clustered in 22 two-
and three-unit town houses to be built near the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Since all of the Trump projects are designed as private
membership clubs, he said he is contemplating a deal under which a
member of one his clubs could play at all four courses. ``They'll
all be top-flight courses,'' Trump said, ``although Seven Springs
will be the highest-end of the group.''

NICHOLS DIRECTORS DISMISS NEW OFFER FOR COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE GOSE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The J.C. Nichols Co. board of directors on
Friday dismissed a rival offer of $70 a share for the company made
late Wednesday and urged shareholders to vote for the merger with
Highwoods Properties Inc., which has offered $65 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols said the higher offer, made by Blackacre Capital
Management of New York, paralleled what Nichols called similar
empty overtures made since the Highwoods deal was announced in
December.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to shareholders released Friday afternoon, Nichols
said, ``We remain confident that the Highwoods merger serves the
best interests of all J.C. Nichols shareholders and can be
accomplished quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Nichols included an extra ballot in the letter so shareholders
who have not voted could cast their vote immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Blackacre said they would decline to comment
until they saw the Nichols letter.
</P>
<P>
   Blackacre, which owns 14 percent of Nichols, made the offer
contingent on several conditions. One centered on Nichols breaking
the Highwoods deal and only paying $2.5 million in termination fees
instead of $17.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols could only pay that fee if shareholders vote down the
merger, Nichols said. And because Blackacre's offer extends only to
July 2 _ one day after the Nichols special meeting to consider the
Highwoods merger _ there's no guarantee that Blackacre would make
an offer, Nichols said.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols also downplayed Blackacre's stated intent to exercise
appraisal rights in the Highwoods deal and the effect it would have
on other shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Highwoods and Nichols struck a deal in which Highwoods would pay
$65 cash, shares of Highwoods stock, or a combination of cash and
stock for each share of Nichols stock. Shareholders may elect to
receive up to 100 percent of Highwoods stock. However, the total
transaction may comprise only 40 percent cash.
</P>
<P>
   Exercising appraisal rights, also known as dissenter rights,
gives shareholders who oppose a merger a chance to get a higher
cash price for the stock after negotiations or an independent
appraisal. Blackacre said that could force some Nichols
shareholders who want cash for their Nichols stock to accept
Highwoods stock instead.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols countered that 29 percent of shareholders already had
said they wanted all Highwoods stock. That leaves at least 45
percent cash for each of the remaining shareholders, in the event
Blackacre exercises appraisal rights.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Nichols conceded, other shareholders could also choose
appraisal rights, which would further affect the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols also questioned Blackacre's proposed structure of the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   To make the transaction more tax-friendly, Blackacre proposed
that the employee stock ownership trust buy up to 15 percent of the
outstanding shares from longtime Nichols shareholders. Blackacre
also suggested that the employee stock trust, which owns about 31
percent of Nichols, would remain an owner of 15 percent of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols said that type of transaction would require Internal
Revenue Service approval, which was not guaranteed and which could
take months to get.

RHODE ISLAND COUPLE'S 26-FOOTER IS FAVORED IN BLOCK ISLAND EVENT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a time when big one-design yachts and all the class rules
that come with them are dominating sailboat racing, a 26-footer
with an independent pedigree is competing as the little boat that
could.
</P>
<P>
   It's called Wai Rere, a New Zealand Maori name that means
``skipping over water.'' Indeed, the owners, Chris and Trice
Bouzaid, a couple from Jamestown, R.I., are finding its skimming
qualities exciting. The sailboat has won at Key West Race Week
twice, and two years ago, won Block Island Race Week.
</P>
<P>
   The boat is a favorite to win the sport-boat division at Block
Island Race Week again when event begins on Monday on Rhode Island
Sound with 133 sailboats expected over all. One of the most
competitive classes will be among the 14 sport boats _ all from
production classes _ trying to unseat the free-spirited Wai Rere
(pronounced Why-REAR-ee). The craft has no class rules other than
to go fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very easy to sail,'' Chris Bouzaid said about his
family's 3-year-old boat. ``And it has none of the tricks and
gimmicks that a lot of the newer sailboats have. That's why we
decided not to buy a boat from a single one-design class. If we
wanted to change something, we wouldn't be able do it,'' he
explained. ``With our boat, we can do anything we want.''
</P>
<P>
   The boat's New Zealand designer, Steve Thompson, has built only
the one boat. Formerly named Tom Tom Taxi, the boat was in New
Zealand when the Bouzaids took it for a sail. By the end of the
day, the couple had bought the boat for $25,000, a good buy. Most
sport boats _ the modern 25-to-35-foot open-cockpit racers _ cost
more like $50,000 to $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   Wai Rere has a oversized ballast bulb at the end of its fin
keel, and a circular, bowl-shaped hull that likes to heel rather
than stay flat in a breeze. The way the Bouzaids see it, that makes
the boat easier to sail than its contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing to it in competition today is the Viper 830GR,
a larger and more expensive version of Wai Rere. Also a Thompson
creation, the sailboat is built in Tiverton, R.I., as a production
model with its own set of class rules. Two Viper 830's are expected
at Block Island, and both have names that indicate a challenge to
the Bouzaids' flying fish: one is High Voltage, and the other,
Snakebite.
</P>
<P>
   2 NEW YACHTS FAVORED
</P>
<P>
   The Newport Bermuda Race got off to a smooth start Friday
afternoon for the fleet of 161 boats that began the race in a
dwindling 7- to 9-knot southwesterly breeze off Newport, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Boomerang, the competition's record-holder, needs to finish in
less than 57 hours 31 minutes 50 seconds, the pace it set in the
635-mile voyage two years ago. Rima and Deep Powder, two new
60-foot yachts designed by Bruce Farr &AMP; Associates of Annapolis,
Md., are favorites to win on corrected time under the International
Measurement System, the handicap racing division in which they are
competing.
</P>
<P>
   The biennial competition draws both amateur cruising boats and
state-of-the-art race boats. Jim Mertz, an 87-year-old yachtsman
from Rye, N.Y., is competing in his 27th Bermuda race. He is
skipper of Symphony, a Beneteau 42.
</P>
<P>
   BRITISH POWERBOAT ON WAY
</P>
<P>
   Cable &AMP; Wireless Adventurer, the odd-shaped, 115-foot powerboat
attempting to break a 83-day record around the world, is expected
to arrive in New York City around 8 a.m., Eastern time, on Tuesday.
The custom-made British boat left Gibraltar on April 19 in its
26,000-mile quest to beat a round-the-world time set in 1960 by the
nuclear-powered submarine the USS Triton.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected to leave New York on Wednesday morning for the
last leg of its journey, a 3,000-mile trans-Atlantic voyage back to
Gibraltar. The powerboat will be docked at North Cove Yacht Harbor,
a marina near the World Financial Center.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG AMERICA TO SAIL
</P>
<P>
   Also at North Cove Yacht Harbor will be Young America, the
75-foot training boat for the New York Yacht Club's America's Cup
challenge in 1999-2000. The white-hulled sailboat was formerly
named Spirit of Unum, a trial horse in San Diego for the PACT `95
cup syndicate. It is expected in New York from Newport, R.I., on
Thursday, and will stay through July 4. It will take potential
donors and sponsors for a sail.

FEDERAL COURT JURY IN TOPEKA REJECTS BILL KOCH'S ARGUMENT THAT TWO
OF HIS BROTHERS DEFRAUDED HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GRACE HOBSON  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ A federal court jury on Friday rejected Bill
Koch's claims that two of his brothers defrauded him of as much as
$2 billion when he sold his stock in the family business, Koch
Industries of Wichita, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's unanimous action ended an 11-week trial that drew
curiosity-seekers throughout and called into question the integrity
of the country's second-largest private company.
</P>
<P>
   It also highlighted a 15-year feud between four brothers in one
of America's richest families: Bill, 57, and Frederick, 64, vs.
Charles, 62, and David, who is Bill's twin.
</P>
<P>
   All are celebrities in their own worlds. Bill, a Palm Beach,
Fla., resident, won the America's Cup in 1992. Frederick is an art
dealer who lives in Monaco. Charles is the company's chief
executive officer and the only brother to remain in Wichita, where
they were raised. David is a vice president who operates in New
York's high society.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1983, when they sold their stock for $1.1 billion, Bill
and Frederick have been battling Charles and David. Soon after the
sale, Bill claimed that Charles and David hid information about the
company to devalue the stock.
</P>
<P>
   The jury found that Koch Industries did make some
``misrepresentations or omissions'' as Bill claimed. But jurors
said the actions were not fraudulent and didn't affect the stock's
worth.
</P>
<P>
   Bill shook his head once when he read the jury's verdict form.
He was the only brother in Topeka for the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence ``showed that maybe they didn't tell every last
thing,'' said jury foreman Stanton Uffman of Linn, Kan. ``We wanted
to say they weren't also blameless, but we thought they negotiated
a fair price.''
</P>
<P>
   Another juror, Cheryl McIntosh of Topeka, said, ``There were
some specific things we felt were misrepresented.''
</P>
<P>
   For Charles, David and Koch Industries, the verdict was a
vindication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Logic says they could not build a company as highly successful
as this without operating in an honest and respectful manner,''
said Koch spokesman Jay Rosser.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Charles said, ``This issue has been painful for
the entire Koch Industries family....There are no winners in
lawsuits of this nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Koch, vowing an appeal, continued to attack the company and
his brothers. He said his case was crippled by the judge's
restrictions on what claims his lawyers could make and how they
could cross-examine Charles and David.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are crooks,'' Bill Koch said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Koch compared his legal battle to the sailing competitions
that led to his taking the America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We first came in dead last,'' he said, ``and still went on to
win it.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial focused on complex issues involving accounting
practices and the company's oil refinery in Pine Bend, Minn. Almost
1,000 exhibits were entered into evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But jurors, who deliberated over two days, said the evidence was
not difficult to sort through because they had heard it repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors also got an earful of family gossip, but insisted it
played no part of their deliberations. For instance, they heard
about a terrible argument at a Christmas dinner in which Bill
allegedly blamed his mother for all his problems. They heard about
how one cousin, 89-year-old Howard Marshall II, married 26-year-old
Playboy centerfold Anna Nicole Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were amazed at the names that were dropped,'' said juror
Nancy Smelser. ``I wouldn't be surprised if a president had walked
in the door.''
</P>
<P>
   The Koch name will continue to be dissected in court. Bill Koch
is suing the company on allegations Koch Industries stole oil from
American Indians. That case will go to trial next year.
</P>
<P>
   Rosser pointed out that the lawsuits are two of 10 that Bill
Koch has filed against Charles and David Koch and the company.
</P>
<P>
   He ``lost nine involving 27 different federal and state judges,
and our...(ability) to run a successful business is intact at every
turn,'' Rosser said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is still hopeful the legal battles will come to a
close.
</P>
<P>
   Bill ``has said for 13 years that all he's wanted is a jury
trial,'' said Koch Industries' lead attorney, Bob Howard of
Wichita. ``He got that _ the jury couldn't speak any louder. All we
can hope is that he moves on in a more productive manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard added, ``Even World War II had an end at some point.''

KHAKIS ARE NOT JUST FOR NERDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JACKIE WHITE  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED_ Khakis. They were once considered classic, classy,
preppy and, well, more than a little boring. They have long been
what men with traditional fashion tastes wore _ sometimes too short
_ with blue blazers. Ditto for women in loafers with baby
strollers.
</P>
<P>
   But khakis began to take on a glossier, hipper image a few years
ago. Designer Karl Lagerfeld, in his unique talent for sweeping up
street fashion, did khakis for Chanel in the mid '90s. Then there
was Seinfeld's buddy George bumbling about in Dockers' khakis. They
became the acceptable fallback for business casual when people
didn't know what to wear.
</P>
<P>
   And now comes Gap's new advertising spot, featuring khaki-clad,
lively, diverse youth dancing away to rock, hip-hop and swing
music. And so khakis are in the forefront yet again. A Cotton Inc.
press release calls them the ``must-have garment of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   And if not exactly high fashion, they are stylized in a variety
of trendy shapes. Liz Claiborne is doing them in three silhouettes
for women. The Gap ad shows wide legs and hip riders.
</P>
<P>
   But are they cutting-edge? Hardly. Khakis date to mid-18th
century British armies and colonialism. The World War I soldiers
liked them enough to tote them home with them from battle.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the appeal in a busy world today is probably the
versatility. They look good with a white T-shirt, a navy blazer, a
button-down or silk shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Skip them for most weddings, fancy parties, executive board
meetings or a reunion of beatniks, but if you don't know what to
wear otherwise, keep khakis handy.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in space?
</P>
<P>
   The next time you're scrounging through your crowded closet in
search of, say, your best white pants, it's OK to feel a touch of
envy toward singer Mariah Carey.
</P>
<P>
   The basement of her newly leased, three-floor townhouse in New
York is converted to a walk-through closet filled with a chair for
facials, clothes and ``a mind-boggling supply'' of shoes, says
InStyle magazine this month.
</P>
<P>
   Pity the poor dear. She has to put on a robe and ride the
elevator down, just to get dressed.

WHITE SHIRT COUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JACKIE WHITE  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Perhaps you find the ups and downs of hemlines
confounding. Maybe the blimp-shaped shoe-topping skirts and fuzzy
high-necked sweaters from fall fashion runways unnerve you. Or with
all the choices, you simply don't know what to wear.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, there is a familiar fallback: the white shirt.
</P>
<P>
   It has made an impressive return to fashion's front ranks this
year after dawdling for a time in the shadows behind the T-shirt,
tank top and turtleneck sweater.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the white shirt is easy to understand and it's
appropriate almost anywhere. Ask actress Sharon Stone, who skipped
beaded designer gowns to wear her husband's white shirt with Vera
Wang's silk wrapped skirt at the most recent Oscar presentations.
</P>
<P>
   Draped nonchalantly, with the top buttons left casually undone,
the shirt remains one of the sexiest garments ever, showing coyly
from beneath a pinstriped trouser suit or topping well-worn jeans.
</P>
<P>
   The basic shirt can be purchased at garage sales for a song and
in couture departments at three figure prices. It is the
quintessential wardrobe staple. It's an item for all seasons. And
most closets have at least a couple tucked in the back.
</P>
<P>
   The Chic Simple series of how-to books on building an easy
classy wardrobe lists the white shirt under ``survival gear,'' as
``instant casual, instant work.'' Katie Couric has been wearing one
over a black and white striped T on ``The Today Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Holland, the merchandise executive at Halls specialty
store in Kansas City, agrees that the white is ``definitely a key
element,'' to dressing this year. But, she notes, the latest styles
reflect some new tweaking. They sometimes come mixed with Lycra so
that they cuddle closer to the body.
</P>
<P>
   They tend to be sleek and short so that they don't bulge over
the hips under a pair of trousers or skirts. (To update your old
ones, crop them at the hips or relegate them to the role of
swimsuit cover-up or tunic for skinny pants.)
</P>
<P>
   For summer, many are revamped in a variety of textiles and
shapes. Donna Karan did a shirt in white organza. White washable
linen shirts come from Kiko at less than $55. Emanuel has a trim
linen tunic.
</P>
<P>
   DKNY offers a romantic short-sleeved embroidered version for
less than $200. Express has sporty sleeveless white shirts at $29.
</P>
<P>
   And from Paris comes a Guy Laroche version, a spiffy sleeveless
fencing style button-trimmed shirt at $415.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, for most people, the white shirt conjures memories: a
round collared blouse slipped under a school jumper, a white
monogram button-down from college days, a first work shirt and a
boyfriend's shirt slipped over jeans on a Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But well beyond modern times, the shirt has had a significant
history in the fashion archives. For women, it began in the late
18th century when they first appropriated men's riding gear for
their own outings. At the end of the 19th century, as sportswomen,
secretaries and shopkeepers moved out into the world, they emulated
the men's tailored style.
</P>
<P>
   They wore shirtwaists or shirts often with tailored coats and
boaters. But they also wore corsets and petticoats underneath,
Alison Lurie notes in her 1980 book, The Language of Clothes. They
were liberated from the waist up.
</P>
<P>
   In the '20s the shirt took on the Buster Brown and Peter Pan
collars. In the '30s Marlene Dietrich gave men's clothing such as
the shirt and tie an elegance, sophistication and knockout
sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   In more recent times Katharine Hepburn's signature was the shirt
and trousers. And Diane Keaton turned the man's shirt into a
walloping fashion wave in ``Annie Hall'' in the 1970s. The boyish
clothes were oversized, baggy, playful, comical and, well, not
especially helpful to women who sought to be taken seriously in the
professional arena.
</P>
<P>
   But soon after, the dress-for-success philosophy that held that
women could be more effective in the workplace if they dressed in
manly fashion arrived. It ushered in the no-nonsense button-down
cotton shirts, often decked with little silk scarf ties.
</P>
<P>
   And so it went. In the '80s and '90s, the shirt still hasn't
lost its classic, good-to-have handy status, whether it flapped
over Karl Lagerfeld's tights in '87 or peered from beneath a power
suit or tucked into Gap khakis in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   As for guidelines for the shirt today, buy the best quality you
can afford. If it's cotton, keep the shirt sleek with minimal
jewelry. If in a fancier fabric, it may be embellished for after
five.
</P>
<P>
   Consider how it will fit into the rest of your wardrobe. And
don't be afraid to be adventurous. You can't go too far wrong.

REAL ESTATE: RESIDENTIAL ASSOCIATIONS GO ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Va., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the pool at Hampton Commons in Hampton Township, N.J.,
opened last month, residents of the 300-unit condominium
association were reminded that only unit owners whose maintenance
charges were current would be admitted. Bathers in arrears, the
board noted, could be fined $25.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Hamptons Common board tack up the announcement
on the bulletin board, but it also went a little further: It posted
a ``news flash'' on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web site is an extremely valuable tool for getting the
word out to our homeowners,'' said Thomas Gaines, secretary of the
condominium association. ``A lot of the people who live here
commute to somewhere else for work. That means there's not always a
lot of time or energy left for going to meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton Commons appears to be on the leading edge of a trend in
community relations _ providing residents with information and
interaction over the Internet as a supplement to the more
traditional ways of communicating with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A growing number of condominium, co-op and homeowner
associations are using the World Wide Web to communicate with
residents,'' said Donna Reichle, director of media relations for
the Community Associations Institute in Alexandria, Va., a trade
organization for co-ops and condominiums. ``And the homeowners are
really responding.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, Ms. Reichle said, her organization has maintained a
Web site that residents, board members and co-op and condominium
managers can turn to for up-to-the-minute information about
community living. The site, http://www.caionline.com, is a central
repository for publications, articles, ``how-to'' advice, court
rulings and real-life experiences of residents and board members
dealing with just about every conceivable aspect of co-op and
condominium ownership and management.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, boards are discovering that what the Community
Associations Institute Web site does for its members, individual
buildings can do on a smaller scale for their unit owners.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton Commons, for example, posts on its Web site the minutes
of every board meeting, reports prepared by committees and notices
that range from who may use the pool to when shrubs displaced by
sewer line work will be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the board also posts bylaws, rules and regulations
and other information relating to the finances of the association.
And, like most Web sites, the Hampton Commons site also provides
links to other Web sites like local schools, governmental agencies
and, of course, the Community Associations Institute which, in
turn, provides links to hundreds of other related sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found that one of the biggest benefits for unit owners
is when the Web site is used as an online service desk,'' said Ms.
Reichle. ``Instead of having to get someone on the phone at the
management company, a resident who has access to a computer and the
Internet can send in an e-mail message any time of the day or
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Some co-ops and condominiums, Ms. Reichle said, post electronic
forms on their Web sites so that when residents want to apply, for
example, for permission to make repairs or alterations, they can
complete the forms online and file them electronically. Other
buildings, she said, use the Web site as a marketing tool for
potential purchasers _ posting pictures, financial reports and
other details about the building and its amenities. ``Buyers can
look at pictures of an apartment, check the financials and even get
a feel for the community without even leaving their desk,'' Ms.
Reichle said.
</P>
<P>
   While establishing a presence on the Internet is neither
technically difficult nor excessively costly, there are at least
two issues that must be addressed by any co-op or condominium board
contemplating such a project.
</P>
<P>
   The first is that not every unit-owner owns a computer or has
access to the Internet. And second, it takes more than just a
rudimentary understanding of computers to establish an internet
address, create a ``home page'' for the site, add content and links
to the site, and then keep that information up-to-date and
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   The first issue, it seems, is quickly taking care of itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``An estimated 28 million households have Internet access
today,'' said Ms. Reichle, adding that in addition to being able to
access the Internet from home computers, many individuals are able
to gain such access from computers at work, school and even from
public libraries.
</P>
<P>
   The second issue _ creation and maintenance of the site _ is
also becoming increasingly easy to address.
</P>
<P>
   At Hampton Commons, for example, a computer-savvy resident,
Bonnie Venable, volunteered her time and expertise to construct the
association's site and keep it current.
</P>
<P>
   And for co-ops and condominiums in New York, the Council of New
York Cooperatives recently began providing member buildings with
the ability to establish a professionally designed site at minimal
cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no longer a luxury to have a Web site,'' said Mary Ann
Rothman, executive director of the Manhattan-based co-op and
condominium organization. ``We have nearly 2,000 member
associations in New York City and its environs and this is our way
of helping our members make the transition into the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the council's Web site (http://www.cnyc.com) has had
nearly 16,000 ``hits,'' or visits by web surfers since it was
established about two years ago. In addition, she said, the council
has received an increasing number of requests from other Web sites
to share mutual links with those sites. As a result, she said, the
council last month established CNYCSites, a web site design and
maintenance service for member buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Chrein, president of Chrein.com, the company that designed
the council's Internet site, said that buildings that sign up for
CNYCSites will have a site designed for them that will be linked
directly with the council's existing site.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to make the process as simple, painless and
inexpensive as possible,'' Chrein said, explaining that the basic
site design being offered to member buildings consists of two
``pages.'' Each page, he explained, can contain virtually any
information that can be stored and displayed on a computer.
</P>
<P>
   At present, Chrein said, the basic package being offered by
CNYCSites allows members to choose from three predesigned templates
into which individual buildings can insert whatever information
they choose.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, Chrein said, the first page _ the home page _
contains information about the building, pictures or illustrations,
and links to other Internet sites. The second page, he said,
usually contains a bulletin board for listings of meetings,
activities and events and for posting apartments for sale or
sublet.
</P>
<P>
   Additional pages can be added so that other information _
including building bylaws, proprietary leases and rules and
regulations _ can be instantly accessed by clicking on a link to
the desired page.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already gotten about 250 hits on the CNYCSites page,''
Chrein said. ``And we've sent out a few dozen application packages
to member buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   For members of the Council of New York Cooperatives, he said,
the one-time charge for designing a two-page site is $400. In
addition, Chrein said, member sites can be updated monthly for an
annual fee of $175. Additional information may be obtained by
calling CNYCSites at (212) 787-3462.

IT'S A GOOD FEELING TO BE FIT AND OVER 50 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EDWARD M. EVELD  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ First of all, when you hear about 65-year-old
Lou Joline competing in 100-mile treks across the mountainous West,
or his goal, some two-thirds completed, of running in a marathon in
every state, do not become despondent.
</P>
<P>
   Joline, of Lake Lotawana, Mo., a suburb of Kansas City, was just
picked by a dietary supplement company as one of the nation's top
``five fittest over 50.'' The idea was to bring attention to the
importance of physical fitness for late middle-agers and seniors.
</P>
<P>
   But in the face of Joline's accomplishments, the danger is
you'll shake your head in despair, then slump back into your
recliner.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the wrong reaction.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so here's Joline's story. About 20 years ago he started
noticing an expanding paunch, so familiar to many in their 40s and
beyond. To be perfectly honest, he needed to drop 35 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most people I settled back to lifting No. 2 pencils,
maybe No. 3,'' Joline said. ``I couldn't get into my Bogner ski
pants.''
</P>
<P>
   Joline started running, and little by little he lost the extra
pounds. He's stayed a trim 130 ever since. About three years into
his exercise regimen, while in Lawrence for a 10-kilometer
(6.2-mile) race, he noticed the event also included a marathon. He
decided to give it a shot. He did quite well, considering he hadn't
planned to run 26 miles that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Heck, this might be my distance,' '' Joline said.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's completed 61 marathons in 31 states. For a real
challenge he runs races up and down Pikes Peak or enters 100-mile
competitions that grind on for 20 hours or more, like the one
coming up in August at Leadville, Colo. There's something wonderful
about running and clambering through a mountain forest, Joline
said. Not to mention incredibly challenging.
</P>
<P>
   ``From last year's results I noticed there were eight people in
their 60s and only two finished,'' Joline said. ``I can't say that
was encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't worry too much about Joline. In fact, at this point
you can forget his story entirely and listen to Kristine Clark.
She's director of sports nutrition at Pennsylvania State University
and one of the judges who pored over thousands of entries in the
Knox NutraJoint Senior Fitness Search.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting fit doesn't mean you have to run marathons or ride
your bike across the country,'' Clark said. ``It means putting on a
comfortable pair of shoes and going out for a walk. You don't have
to have pain to have gain. That's one of the unfortunate myths.''
</P>
<P>
   As people get older, they require fewer calories, Clark said.
Cutting back can mean even a small reduction of 100 or 200 calories
a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take much,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clark said it was an ``emotional experience'' reading
about the fitness accomplishments of the contest entrants. The
winners ranged in age from 51 to 82. They should inspire all of us,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're 60 years old, you want to be able to pick up your
own grandchild, lift your own grocery bag, open doors,'' Clark
said.
</P>
<P>
   Joline, a grandfather himself, agrees, of course. His advice for
getting more exercise is to make it a social event. He belongs to
three running clubs and is president of the Kansas City Track Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Find a friend. Get in with a group,'' said Joline, a computer
programmer at John Knox Village in Lee's Summit, Mo. ``If your
friends are doing it, you're going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Joline advises getting out three times a week to start, perhaps
30 minutes each time, and walking or jogging at a pace that allows
you to converse. You have to make some concessions to age, he said,
such as allowing for more time for warmup and recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't fool Mother Nature forever,'' said Joline.
</P>
<P>
   But you can try.

AS WOMEN TOP 40, THEY SHOULD EXPAND THE FOCUS ON THEIR OWN HEALTH
NEEDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EDWARD M. EVELD  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Nancy L. Snyderman, the medical correspondent for
``Good Morning America,'' remembers her summer job during high
school assisting a respiratory therapist at a hospital. A patient
needed an emergency tracheotomy and a call went out over the
loudspeaker for a surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up and there was my father,'' Snyderman said. ``He
saved her life right in front of me. It really blew me away.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed Snyderman was destined to become a doctor. She'd been
saying so at least since third grade. Her father and grandfather
were doctors; it was how the family defined itself.
</P>
<P>
   She decided on a specialty in ears, nose and throat, just as her
father did, and was the first female surgeon at the University of
Arkansas in Little Rock. Now, at 46 and with three young children,
she's decided an important focus for her is women's health,
especially women over 40, a topic she thinks was long neglected by
the medical profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system was designed by men for men,'' Snyderman said. ``It
wasn't malicious. That's just how it evolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Women who understand that will more likely assert themselves
when it counts, Snyderman said. Health care for women in their 40s
and later, with the cultural changes over the last generation,
isn't getting any easier to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wacky decade, the 40s, for women,'' Snyderman said.
``Half are going through menopause, the other half are on fertility
drugs trying to have babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyderman says her message is a call to arms for women to be
proactive about their health care, especially as they age and their
risk of health problems increases. Women in their 40s start to feel
and see changes in their bodies unlike any time since puberty:
aching backs, wrinkling skin, sleeplessness _ and potentially more
serious changes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a crucial time for women to take charge, Snyderman said.
Women should, first, trust their gut instincts about their health
and, second, foster a good relationship with their doctors, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Women have to be able to talk comfortably with their doctors, to
tell them what they think about undergoing certain tests and
treatments, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really trained as women to have good manners,''
Snyderman said, ``and good manners don't always serve us well.''
</P>
<P>
   That women are the chief nurturers in families often means they
neglect their own health while caring for others, Snyderman said.
The result is they don't get prompt medical attention and,
ultimately, their families suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the women in families get sick, families can fall apart,
and the rest of communities, too,'' Snyderman said.
</P>
<P>
   When Snyderman gives talks around the country, women ask about
the health changes they're experiencing and ones they're
anticipating, with some trepidation. As a resource for such women,
Snyderman wrote Dr. Nancy Snyderman's Guide to Good Health, a book
geared to women that covers such issues as heart disease, cancer,
menopause, aging and preventive health care.
</P>
<P>
   Snyderman notes in the book that some health changes are
inevitable and some are exacerbated by a variety of bad habits,
such as too much caffeine, sun and alcohol as well as poor posture,
bad diets and lack of exercise.
</P>
<P>
   And she tries to dispel common myths about women's health. One,
that because women live much longer than men, their health care
isn't as big a worry. Actually, Snyderman said, women don't live
much longer than men and many, at the end of life, must deal with
widowhood, dependency and degenerative conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Two, that women's poor health is related mostly to their
reproductive organs. While it's true that women need health care
for maladies specific to their gender, it's also true that the
leading causes of death for men and women are the same _ heart
disease, cancer and stroke _ and in the same order, Snyderman said.
</P>
<P>
   Snyderman finds that women, especially those past 40, are hungry
for information about preventing illness. Although her book goes
into more detail about prevention, Snyderman's brief advice is
this: Drink water, don't smoke, watch your diet and exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Women also want to learn more about alternative health care,
Snyderman said. She encourages them to consider such options, but
only when it seems reasonable. For instance, she said, taking
echinacea for a cold or trying chiropractic or acupuncture for back
pain would make sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to be open enough to tailor the treatment to
the specific problem,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her personal appearances and her book, Snyderman reaches
millions of viewers on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' which also
allows her to meet and interview the best physicians in a variety
of fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasingly I have to really watch it so I don't get pulled
away too much,'' said Snyderman, who lives in San Francisco with
her husband and three children, ages 12, 9 and 4. ``I grew up to be
a doctor; I think that's what I'm good at.''
</P>
<P>
   But she sees parallels between her TV work and regular
doctoring, and she appreciates the opportunity to reach so many
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking to people on the television is very much like sitting
with a patient at bedside,'' she said, in terms of the skills that
are needed. ``It's basically good communication, and I think good
doctors know how to communicate.''

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Did you know ...
</P>
<P>
   - Americans grill 2.3 times a week, according to the
grillmeisters at Weber. (Compare that with just three times a year
for the folks in the United Kingdom.)
</P>
<P>
   - Three out of four homes in the United States own a grill.
</P>
<P>
   - The most popular holiday weekend for grilling out is July
Fourth.
</P>
<P>
   - Most popular grilled foods: hamburger, steak, hot dogs and
chicken breast.
</P>
<P>
   - The Barbecue Industry Association found the most common
ingredient used to doctor up barbecue sauce is garlic, followed by
brown sugar.
</P>
<P>
   - Half of all marshmallows eaten in the United States have been
toasted over a barbecue grill.
</P>
<P>
   The association also includes this juicy morsel in a recent
press release: ``The Midwest is the barbecue hotbed _ if you can't
find a meat and sauce combination you like in Kansas City, you
can't find it anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, here.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of our town ...
</P>
<P>
   First it was Saveur magazine, and now the June issue of Food &AMP;
Wine magazine features a recipe for B.B's Lawnside Spicy Apple
Cider Barbecue Sauce. The article, written by cookbook author
Steven Raichlen, explores the four major styles of barbecue sauce:
Kansas City, Texas, North Carolina and Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   Not just for breakfast anymore ... Susan Moehl and Penni
Johnson, the proprietors of Southmoreland, a Mobil Four-Star
bed-and-breakfast on Kansas City's Country Club Plaza, are dishing
up a barbecue breakfast for their guests from May to October. The
women use a hand-laid limestone barbecue pit to whip up such
breakfast barbecue meats as pork chops or ribs to ham or sausage
kebabs. They also sear Texas toast on the grill.
</P>
<P>
   On the global grill ...
</P>
<P>
   Cooking teacher and cookbook author Steven Raichlen spent three
years traveling the globe exploring the wide world of barbecue
culture for his much anticipated Barbecue Bible (Workman).
</P>
<P>
   This month you can find Raichlen's Greek-inspired recipes for
Grill-Roasted Leg of Lamb with Lemon Butter, Greek-Style Garlic and
Lemon Roasted Potatoes and Swordfish Souvlaki on the Internet at
www.weberbbq.com.
</P>
<P>
   Heads up for Brazil ...
</P>
<P>
   I've noticed several trend trackers hailing Brazilian barbecue
(known in that country as churrasco) as the next hot food trend
coming down the pike. If a recent family vacation to Denver is any
indication, it's already starting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Three Rodizio (pronounced ho-dee-zee-oh) restaurants are
thriving. On two nights I enjoyed the full-blown meal, a staggering
variety of meats from a skewer _ including picanha (a
Brazilian-style beef filet), lamb, fish and delectable nibbles of
bacon-wrapped turkey.
</P>
<P>
   A $15.95 per person price tag included gaucho-clad waiters and a
staggering self-serve salad bar with such exotic goodies as fresh
buffalo mozzarella, quail's eggs and feijoada, a black-bean stew.

   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ When Gov. George Pataki angrily disclosed a
$42 million payment to the chairman of Long Island Lighting Co.
earlier this month, he denounced it as ``an extraordinary secret
act of greed.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   But formal documents show that state officials had known the
takeover would result in millions of dollars in benefits to Lilco
executives, even if the exact amount was not specified. The records
include Securities and Exchange Commission filings, Lilco's
takeover agreement, its agreement to merge with Brooklyn Union Gas
and correspondence from the Long Island Power Authority, the state
agency that negotiated the takeover.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has clouded the governor's triumph in revamping Long
Island's electricity service at long last and delivering a 20
percent cut in what, under Lilco, had been the highest bills in the
continental United States.
</P>
<P>
   The payouts, which also included $25 million to 25 other top
Lilco executives, bolstered the central argument of takeover
opponents, who contend that the $7 billion deal was a giveaway to
Lilco that burdens electricity customers with debt. The critics
charge that Pataki and his aides purposely ignored the compensation
issue for fear it would jeopardize the takeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did nothing, because to reveal what was taking place
would have blown the deal sky high,'' said Wayne Prospect, a
coordinator for an opposition group, the Initiative for Competitive
Energy. ``Their attempt at being outraged and shocked is totally
disingenuous.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has ordered the state attorney general and the Public
Service Commission to investigate the payouts and demanded that the
former Lilco chairman, Dr. William Catacosinos, return the money
and quit as chairman of Lilco's successor, Marketspan. The power
authority, which hired Marketspan to run the old Lilco system, is
withholding $1 million a month and imposing other penalties, and
the state Assembly has set a hearing on the matter for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and his power authority chairman, Richard Kessel, insist
that the payouts were surreptitious and violated the takeover and
merger pacts. They contend that Lilco executives were not entitled
to severance payments because they all automatically got new jobs
at Marketspan and never lost a day's pay.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and Kessel declined to comment directly about what the
documents disclosed about the compensation entitlements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact remains this was an extraordinary act of greed, and
Catacosinos should give it back and resign,'' reiterated the
governor's spokesman, Michael McKeon.
</P>
<P>
   Kessel said, ``The bottom line is LIPA's agreement prohibited
these payments, period, and in fact the Lilco board engaged in a
willful attempt to conceal this information from the power
authority and the state.''
</P>
<P>
   But the documents paint a different picture.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1984, Lilco's corporate filings showed that
Catacosinos was building the framework for handsome retirement and
severance benefits. In 1994, during a Lilco takeover bid by Gov.
Mario Cuomo, the power authority's counsel, Richard P. Bonnifield,
wrote to Kessel about Catacosinos' ``golden parachute.'' That memo
said Lilco had set aside trusts to provide more than $10 million
``to fund his post-employment compensation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On May 21, 1997, Kessel sent his agency's response to questions
about the most recent takeover plan from the chairman of the
Assembly Energy Committee, Paul Tonko. Addressing severance pay,
the letter said that Lilco officers had individual contracts
providing benefits if the company had ``a change of control.''
Those benefits included three years' salary, accelerated vesting of
supplemental retirement benefits and three years of life and health
insurance. The letter concluded, ``The transactions contemplated
with Brooklyn Union and/or LIPA will result in a change of control
as defined in the employment agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1997, the joint Lilco-Brooklyn Union proxy statement
said that the merger and takeover ``will each result in a change in
control'' of Lilco and thus ``entitle each officer to the benefits
payable under the terms of the employment agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   The registration statement that the companies filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission that month said: ``The
transactions contemplated with Brooklyn Union and/or LIPA will
result in a change of control (as defined in these agreements) and
entitle each officer to the benefits payable under the terms of the
employment agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   The June 1997 merger agreement states Lilco's responsibility to
pay obligations ``relating to several change-of-control or similar
payments payable to executives of Lilco in connection with the
closing.'' Another section refers to the benefits to be paid ``as a
result of the termination of executive employment.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 25, 1998, opponents of the deal released Bonnifield's
1994 memo on the $10 million-plus golden parachute. In an interview
at that time, Kessel expressed no surprise about the memo. He did
not argue, as he does now, that such payments were prohibited, nor
did he indicate any plans to try to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   ``LIPA has nothing to do with this,'' Kessel said then.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen days later, in a Newsday report on the same issue, he
stressed that the power authority would never make such payments,
but he did not contest Lilco's right to do so. He was quoted
saying, ``The bottom line is, whatever compensation exists for
Lilco executives, the LIPA plan completely protects rate payers
from having to pay for it now or in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Kessel now says he does not recall why he did not take a
militant stance in March and April against the planned Lilco
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Marketspan's spokesman, Joseph McDonnell, a former Lilco
executive who received a payment, said: ``The employment contracts
were disclosed in Lilco's financial filings and its agreement with
LIPA. LIPA officials never expressed the view that anything in the
agreement prevented Lilco from making these payments, nor did it
seek to know the amount of the payments.''
</P>
<P>
   The critics have pounced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pataki and Kessel were asleep at the wheel,'' said Gordian
Raacke, director of a court-appointed Lilco watchdog group, the
Citizens Advisory Panel. ``They didn't do their due diligence. If
they claim they didn't know, they are incompetent to run our
electric system. The Catacosinos incident is only the first of a
series of abuses we can expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Shapiro, a lawyer for the New York Public Interest
Research Group, which filed suit against the takeover, said:
``While $67 million is a lot of money for normal people, it's not
even a drop in the bucket in terms of the overall $7 billion deal.
It's a drop in the ocean, and it's the entire ocean that Pataki
gave away.''
</P>
<P>
   Graef Crystal, a compensation analyst and critic of high
executive salaries, has studied documents in the case and
concluded, ``In our view, the governor had every reason to know
that these payments would be made.''

 &HT;    Trial by fire: Work, luck, wind save Florida town
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALDO, Fla. -- Jim Hooten stood under the 100-year-old oak trees
that tower over his modest wood frame house, watching a wall of
orange flames rage through the dense stand of pines that grows
nearly to his back door.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, he feared, his house and all he had worked for
would be gone, consumed by the latest wave of wildfires that have
swept across nearly 50,000 acres of bone-dry Florida the past
month. Scattered showers Thursday night and Friday weakened the
fires but did little to end the dangerous drought conditions.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday, the fires in 34 of Florida's 67 counties had
destroyed about 12,000 acres of timber worth an estimated $10
million, injured at least 14 people and killed one person, damaged
about 80 buildings and 65 vehicles, and left at least 1,000 people
temporarily homeless. Across the line in Georgia, wildfires had
burned another 13,600 acres, including an estimated $14 million
worth of timber, near the Okefenokee Swamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were standing right here when we decided it was getting too
close and we had to get out,'' said Hooten, 62, a tall,
leather-faced ex-deputy sheriff. ``I was thinking, `That's a
lifetime of work going to hell in a handbasket.'''
</P>
<P>
   A half-mile away, Tammy Nichols and several other members of a
Florida Division of Forestry firefighting team were working
frantically to make sure that didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 10 tractors on it,'' said Richard Eastman, the team's
supervisor, who has 34 years of firefighting experience. ``We just
kept cutting lines, moving back and cutting lines.''
</P>
<P>
   A mile away from the firefighters at Waldo City Hall, Mayor
Louie Davis, City Councilmember Rodney Estes and City Manager Lee
Vincent came to the sobering realization that the fire just might
consume their entire town, burning the homes and businesses of the
1,100 residents.
</P>
<P>
   It was Wednesday afternoon, and they had just ordered the second
evacuation of Waldo in as many days. Fortunately, most of the
residents on the side of town nearest the blaze heeded the warnings
and left. Most went to stay with family or friends or to motels in
nearby Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   They got out just in time.
</P>
<P>
   By 3 p.m., winds were gusting out of the southwest at nearly 20
mph. The fire was raging dangerously close to a half-dozen
residences, and if it managed to cross a paved road on the town's
outskirts, quaint, sleepy Waldo would likely burn to cinders. The
flames would be fueled by the clapboards of the town's rustic,
wood-sided homes and the hardwood trees that shadow its streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked outside and the heavy smoke was right over there,''
said Vincent, pointing from the sidewalk in front of the modest
brick storefront that serves as City Hall. ``What worried me most
was the smoke was coming right over City Hall. That meant the fire
was coming right at us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Davis and a few others hopped in a car and drove toward
the billowing column of smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were several houses there that when we went past, we
were pretty sure there was no way they could be saved,'' Davis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hooten thought the same thing as he jammed his pickup into gear
and headed up his dusty driveway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have given you a quarter that this house would
still be standing,'' he said. ``Not a quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, though, Waldo survived.
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted fire crews redoubled their efforts. The wind shifted a
little bit. The scorching sun, which has dried the state
relentlessly through three nearly rainless months, dipped into the
haze of smoke surrounding Waldo and raced to the horizon. As it
dropped, temperatures inched down from the 100-degree mark. As the
land cooled ever so slightly, a bit of moisture crept back into the
air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the hard work of the firefighters, a little shift in
the wind and a little bit of luck,'' Davis said the next day.
``That, and the Good Lord smiled on us.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been an odd weather year for Waldo. All winter, the town
was inundated by unusually heavy rains. Flooding hit a few homes,
tore up some roads, and caused major problems at the wastewater
treatment plant. Waldo was part of a federal disaster relief
declaration for the flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Now it may be named a disaster area again, this time for fire
damage caused by drought. It's all been a little more excitement
than folks are accustomed to in Waldo, but a smalltown politeness
has prevailed. ``I've answered hundreds of phone calls and not one
person has been ugly,'' said Gail Monahan, who is married to Estes
and volunteered to staff City Hall during the crisis. ``They all
ask if their house is OK, and when I tell them `Yes,' they
immediately say, `Tell all the firefighters thank you, thank you so
much.' Small towns do pull together.''
</P>
<P>
   For hours on end, Monahan and others kept answering the
telephones. The calls came from people they know by name and face
residents kept out because the fire danger was still too high.
</P>
<P>
   Some left behind pets and were worried the animals hadn't been
fed. Estes, a high school economics teacher, volunteered to go to
the houses in question to feed and water the pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to turn the air-conditioning on for one lady,'' he said.
``She took her dogs, but forgot she left her birds at home in a
cage. She was worried they would get too hot.''
</P>
<P>
   After 36 non-stop hours, the City Hall crew was exhausted but
giddy from adrenaline and the town's near-miss.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent figures he slept about five or six hours total on
Tuesday and Wednesday nights. Tuesday he got home for a few hours
before returning at dawn Wednesday. Wednesday night he slept in
Police Chief D.W. Smith's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned off the phones in there and slept on a little pad
about an inch thick,'' he said. ``I finally took all the money out
of my pocket because I kept rolling over on it and waking myself
up.''
</P>
<P>
   On the fireline, Tammy Nichols and her team members didn't sleep
at all. They came on duty Wednesday morning and went straight
through until Thursday morning when they finally got a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome,'' said Nichols, 31, a Florida forest ranger
the past 10 years. ``The flames were up to the top of the trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Nichols drives a bulldozer, cutting fire lines to try to stop
the flames from advancing. She wears a fire-retardant jumpsuit over
her pants and T-shirt, along with a hard-hat, a face shield and
heavy leather gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday the flames jumped the fire breaks they were trying to
cut through the parched undergrowth. Bulldozers bogged down, even
threw a heavy metal track. Mechanics had to brave the flames to
repair the machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just moving too fast,'' Nichols said.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols and the other forest service firefighters carry a
folded-up fire safety tent made of a space-age aluminum-foil type
material. If the fire engulfs them, they are supposed to jump off
their 'dozers, run back into the fire line they've cut and
hopefully find a spot where the fire has already passed. Then they
break out the tent and jump inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had to do it,'' Nichols said. ``We just try to be
real careful. I have a four-year-old daughter. I try to think about
her when I'm out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hebb, a forestry division district manager, ambled over to
the crew, who were gathered around a pickup waiting for a van to
carry them home for a few hours' rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want y'all to know how much people appreciate what
y'all have been doing,'' he told the firefighters, who stood in a
loose circle, their faces and clothes as dirty as frolicsome
children's. There was plenty of confirmation of that at the Hooten
house.
</P>
<P>
   The fire raged through the 40 acres of pine trees that Jim
Hooten was hoping to harvest in a few years as a nice addition to
his retirement income. It burned up a feed shed and two barns full
of farm equipment, antiques and family heirlooms.
</P>
<P>
   But the family home still stands, untouched, a black fire line
still smoldering in the pines that march to within 20 feet of the
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never believed those boys would save that house,'' Hooten
said. ``They were spraying it down with foam when I left . . . I
can't believe they saved it. I can't believe they saved it.''

 &HT;    The Americanization of New Orleans
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS -- It seemed like an odd attachment.
</P>
<P>
   To an outsider, the K&AMP;B drugstores here were nothing but boxy
buildings with funny purple signs _ a bit of an eyesore next to the
mansions along St. Charles Avenue. But natives loved them, and when
the Pennsylvania-based national chain Rite Aid bought them out,
many vowed they would never shop there again.
</P>
<P>
   K&AMP;B operated in New Orleans for more than 90 years, and the
color of the chain's logo _ not quite violet, not quite lavender _
had entered the local vocabulary as ``K&AMP;B purple.'' They sold
things not usually found at the corner drugstore, such as bourbon
and vodka in plastic bottles with purple labels, and ice cream in
flavors such as cream cheese and eggnog.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Rite Aid, surprised by this fierce brand loyalty,
removed their peppy ``Your drugstore just got better'' banners and
slowed the process of replacing the K&AMP;B logo with their more
generic red, white and blue one. And just to show there are no hard
feelings, the Rite Aid folks held a charity auction of K&AMP;B
memorabilia _ purple shopping baskets, playing cards, and clerk
smocks. Die-hard K&AMP;B fans arrived before dawn; by noon, more than
1,000 people had shown up.
</P>
<P>
   Why all the fuss over a dying drugstore chain? Because a battle
for the soul of New Orleans is being waged, and, for the moment,
the outsiders are winning.
</P>
<P>
   At least a dozen locally owned institutions have sold out or
closed in the past three years, and national chains, once
conspicuously absent here, are arriving in droves. The likes of the
House of Blues, Pottery Barn and Starbucks _ opening this summer _
are making the city feel more ... American. To many in this
aggressively untrendy town, Americanization represents a fate worse
than hurricanes, heat waves and bad oysters.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Orleans has an incredibly unique history, and nothing can
ever take that away,'' said Dannal Perry, a museum educator with
two historic houses in the French Quarter who stocked up on K&AMP;B
purple merchandise before Rite Aid took over. ``But if we don't
take care of our local businesses, we'll be Cleveland. Why would
anyone want to come here if we lose our unique personality?''
</P>
<P>
   The fear is not unfounded. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the House of Blues, a slick, no-expenses-spared
nightclub chain owned, in part, by Dan Aykroyd, opened in the
French Quarter. The club immediately stole big local acts such as
the Neville Brothers from the considerably less glitzy local icon
Tipitina's. The old club almost closed.
</P>
<P>
   Krauss Co., a homegrown department store in an ornate historic
building on Canal Street, closed in 1997 after 90 years.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Maison Blanche, another local department store on Canal
Street, announced it had been sold to Dillard's Inc. The Arkansas
chain probably will close the downtown store and rename the ones in
the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Starbucks, the ubiquitous Seattle coffeehouse
chain, will open in Uptown, a tony, residential area near Audubon
Park served by locally owned coffeehouses with strong followings.
Some are wondering whether Starbucks will go head to head in the
French Quarter with the famous Cafe Du Monde, home of chicory
coffee and sugary beignets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phenomenon of national companies replacing mom-and-pop
stores has been going on for years in most cities, but New Orleans
has resisted this,'' said Tim Ryan, dean of the College of Business
at the University of New Orleans. For example, Louisiana was the
last state in the nation that had no interstate banks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We revel in our uniqueness; we're proud of our local
institutions,'' Ryan said. ``Krauss existed for years after it (no
longer) was economically viable. It's amazing it didn't go out of
business 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Although proud provincialism has played a role in keeping the
national chains at bay, pure economics are involved as well. After
the oil bust of the late 1970s and early 1980s, national companies
were afraid to set up shop in New Orleans. Now that the city is
enjoying a rebound, it seems as good a place as any to do business.
</P>
<P>
   The economy may have improved, but the provincialism remains.
There was even a Mardi Gras parade devoted to the battle over the
heart and soul of New Orleans, called ``Souled Down the River.''
Revelers dressed as zombies in K&AMP;B clerk uniforms, and held signs
that said, ``Your drugstore just got worse.'' A float called the
Old Absent House mourned the closing of one of the oldest bars in
the French Quarter, the Old Absinthe House. The marchers ended the
night with a party in the now-vacant Krauss building.
</P>
<P>
   People are very curious to see how Starbucks affects business at
CC's Gourmet Coffee House, Rue de la Course, and PJ's Coffee and
Tea Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a formidable foe, and I take that very seriously,''
said Phyllis Jordan, owner of PJ's. ``A lot of people say, `Oh, you
have nothing to worry about; people here are so provincial, they
won't go with a national chain.' I'm not so sure. It's up to us to
meet the competition and serve our customers better.''
</P>
<P>
   To do that, PJ's plans to emphasize its uniquely New Orleans
spirit with one-on-one service and a slower pace.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan argues that some local businesses have improved, thanks
to new competition. Tipitina's, which almost closed when the House
of Blues came to town, is thriving again by concentrating on
lesser-known, locally popular bands. They've even opened a second
location.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone agrees that competition helps.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Rochester, owner of the Funky Butt, a jazz club on the
edge of the French Quarter, said he thinks Tipitina's has ``gone
corporate'' and lost its authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these places moving in make me very, very nervous,'' he
said. ``Places like the House of Blues and Storyville (another
glitzy jazz club set to open on Bourbon Street) are so huge and
have so much money, it's going to have a major effect on a little
struggling place like the Funky Butt. They're just creating
atmosphere, whereas we have it naturally.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Terrence Fitzmorris, director of the Center
for the Study of New Orleans and the Mississippi River at Tulane
University, said he thinks people are overreacting.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Orleans is indeed an American city. It's just that our
understanding of what it is to be an American city has changed in
the last 50 years,'' he said. ``Atlanta is now considered an
American city, and New Orleans is not because it has held on to
much of its ethnicity and showcases its heritage. But New Orleans
reinvents itself just like any other city. I don't think Rite Aid
replacing K&AMP;B takes the heart out of New Orleans.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, some of the outsiders were invited in. State
and local leaders OK'd plans for a huge, land-based casino near the

went bankrupt operating a temporary casino while building a
permanent one, has been given the go-ahead to finish construction

   ``Is Rite Aid any worse than placing a monstrosity in the middle
of Canal Street?'' Fitzmorris said. ``Because New Orleans has an
exotic history of being French and Spanish, people assume it will
act in an exotic fashion. But New Orleans fits the American mold.
It just has added layers.''

 &HT;    Firefighters clean up after the fire
 &HT;    By Scott McCabe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE _ Mop-up duty doesn't lead to firefighting glory,
but someone has to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Kinkaid was chomping at the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Mop up means bulldozing street-wide paths through dense forest
to separate the charred land from the green, hosing down dry edges
and extinguishing sudden flares.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the glamour work, but I don't want to lose this
thing,'' Kinkaid said of the subdued fire that earlier this week
burned more than 300 square acres at Brannan Field Park, south of
Interstate 10 and just east of the Naval Air Station at
Jacksonville. ``We worked too hard to contain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinkaid, a state forest firefighter, was joined Friday by five
firefighters from South Florida who pulled into their hotels at 2
a.m yesterday morning.
</P>
<P>
   All told, 12 firefighters from South Florida _ three from Palm
Beach County _ have traveled north to help battle the raging brush
fires. They join crews from other states that are are monitoring
more than 7,000 square acres here.
</P>
<P>
   Three volunteers from the Martin County Red Cross left Friday
for Northeast Florida to help feed fire victims.
</P>
<P>
   South Florida firefighters awoke at 5 a.m. Friday to begin
mop-up duty.
</P>
<P>
   The team split into day and night shifts. The first hooked up
around noon with crews from as far away as South Carolina and
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Despite temperatures striking 103 Friday, a record high for
Jacksonville, firefighters spent the day preventing rather than
putting out flames. Thanks to little wind, the few fires that
popped up were quickly checked, and no new fires began.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Brad Havrilla of Palm Beach County spent most of the day
fighting through forest to water down smoldering pine. He
concentrated on the perimeter of a 12-acre area that caught fire
two days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out here, there are more things to anticipate,'' he said. ``If
things start coming on you, you might have to just run while in a
structure fire you might be able to bunker down.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday morning, Jacksonville firefighters warned the men
about an unexpected danger if the area had to be evacuted:
Uncooperative homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   A man whose Alachua home was in the path of a wildfire Wednesday
wouldn't leave. He had greeted firefighters with an M-16, according
to a firefighter who talked the man into letting his wife leave the
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the case, get out of there,'' District Chief R.E.
Garmon of Jacksonville told the men Friday morning. ``Let it
burn.''
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters kept that home and othes safe. No arrests were
made.
</P>
<P>
   No evacuations were ordered Friday in Duvall County, where the
crew of South Florida firefighters is expected to remain until
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But until a good rain comes, crews will work around the clock
preparing for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we don't have rain, whether it's for days or for
months, the smoke will continue to burn,'' Kinkaid said, pointing
to small flames erupting from the ashes. ``That's why we have to do
the dirty work and stay on top of it.''

REAL ESTATE: MARKETING A NUCLEAR TEST SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MERCURY, Nev. _ To visit the Nevada Test Site, the nation's
primary nuclear proving ground for more than four decades, and
stand near a crater blasted deep into the desert bedrock, is an
exercise in silence.
</P>
<P>
   The dry lake beds and thorny plains where scientists detonated
nuclear weapons during the Cold War are now, in peacetime, mostly
devoid of activity and hundreds of sheds and warehouses that once
housed personnel and research facilities are now eerily empty.
</P>
<P>
   So it may be surprising that this test range, as big as Rhode
Island, polluted in places with radiation and shielded behind a
veil of secrecy, is described in a brochure as ``open for
business.''
</P>
<P>
   And it may also be surprising that employees of the federal
Department of Energy, which controls the test site and the nation's
nuclear program, now use phrases such as ``commercial development''
and ``private investment'' alongside traditional test site jargon
like ``kiloton yield.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to generate money and promote economic development
here in southern Nevada following a moratorium on nuclear testing
in 1992, the government has begun to transform parts of this base _
where the staff has been cut from 10,000 to 2,500 _ into a business
park of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are invited to open facilities at the test site _
whose main entrance is near this small town 65 miles north of Las
Vegas _ with the unusual lures of restricted access and absence of
neighbors who, for example, might complain about the use of toxic
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year-old program is similar to the Defense
Department's effort to help communities hurt by military
downsizing. But there are some important differences: The test site
is under no threat of closing, has no plans to sell off land and is
mandated to stay ready for nuclear tests in case international
tensions rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a site with characteristics that don't exist anywhere
else,'' said Tim Carlson, president of Nevada Test Site Development
Corp., the nonprofit organization financed by the Energy Department
to market the test site. ``In there, you find a niche. Take the
aerospace industry, for example. Where else can you find restricted
airspace in the United States? Where else can you launch a reusable
rocket?''
</P>
<P>
   The only tenant so far is Fluid Tech, a company that cleans
equipment contaminated with low-level radiation. To its relief, it
has found a warm welcome inside a massive abandoned hangar with
steel blast doors, cleaning bays and an overhead crane. There, in
the '60s, scientists tried to develop a nuclear-powered rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Fluid Tech had built a facility in the nearby town of Amargosa
Valley, but was blocked from opening by local opposition. Dean
Rowsell, president of Fluid Tech, said that his company had avoided
hassles by situating its operation in a desolate valley 15 miles
inside the test site, even though the five-year lease cost ``as
much or more as in Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're willing to pay it because we have a pretty good idea
of the problems we'll go through there,'' he said, referring to
environmental and political problems he would experience in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Fluid Tech's staff of about 40 workers and those government
employees not housed on the base live in such surrounding
communities as Las Vegas, Amargosa Valley, Tonopah and Pahrump, all
within two hours' drive of the test-site entrance.
</P>
<P>
   One company that expects to move to the test site within the
next two years is Kistler Aerospace, which is planning to launch
satellites from the base on the world's first fully reusable
rocket. Launches require restricted airspace and dozens of square
miles of flat open land for the rockets to return _ if all goes
well _ using a parachute and airbags.
</P>
<P>
   The company anticipates building a launch pad and several
buildings for flight control and assembly, representing a $45
million investment. Robert Wang, chairman of Kistler Aerospace,
said that his company was attracted by the availability of
utilities (unlike remote sites elsewhere) and equipment and the
potential of hiring part-time skilled personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Other businesses expressing interest in signing on for one of
the various vacant buildings or at an industrial park planned
around the base airport include a company that recycles carbon, a
liquid-oxygen manufacturer and a company that is developing
hydrogen enriched natural gas for cars. One firm that is
considering building a solar power plant on the test site is now
negotiating with potential customers.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses that move into the test site must still get state
licensing and follow environmental laws, which are generally less
restrictive in isolated locations. They must also get approval from
a board, which weighs such factors as the impact of the business on
national security, safety, interference with a neighboring Air
Force base and the creation of high technology jobs that could go
to laid-off test site workers.
</P>
<P>
   That eliminates tennis-shoe manufacturers, for example,
according to Richard Betteridge, an Energy Department official who
is working to bring new activities to the test site. Even in the
unlikely event that such a business would want to be so far from a
city where workers could live, its presence at the test site would
not benefit the government's mission to create skilled jobs and
diversify southern Nevada's growing, but still casino-dependent,
economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Betteridge added that one man who wanted to open a juvenile drug
rehabilitation program was ``obviously turned down in one telephone
call.'' Other companies, he said, lose interest once they learn
that the test site is not immune from regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people come out here and think `I can do anything, I can
pollute all I want,''' Betteridge said. ``Once they find out that's
not the case, they don't call back.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Among the market offerings are some for only temporary use, such
as an existing hazardous chemical spill center, which companies
like DuPont could lease for a few weeks to conduct safety drills.
And officials at the test site are also trying to attract more
government work, perhaps an antiterrorism center where engineers
would blow up mock buildings to learn how to build with more
durable materials. Universities are welcome to use the test site
for research, an Energy Department said.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the test site will probably never be considered for
commerce. Parts of the base are reserved for secret military
projects, future nuclear detonations and an underground
nuclear-waste depository called Yucca Mountain, which is scheduled
to open in the next century. In addition, there are occasional
nuclear experiments not involving a chain reaction, crater fields,
and a small portion of land contaminated by radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial development is a profound transformation for the test
site, which has been the nation's primary venue for nuclear weapons
testing since 1951. Over the years, 928 nuclear devices have been
detonated, at first in the atmosphere, then deep underground after
the harmful effects of radiation became better known.
</P>
<P>
   The work stoked the economy in the neighboring rural counties
and gave life to Mercury, the restricted government town on the
test site at which hundreds of scientists once spent the night in
dormitories. After the Cold War ended and much of the staff left,
the town's movie theater and bowling alley were closed.
</P>
<P>
   If nuclear tests resume, the Energy Department says new
companies at the test site will not be thrown out nor be
contaminated by fallout. But some may be kept from their facilities
as a precaution for, at most, a few days when tests are scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   It is too soon to say whether there will be much of a demand in
the business world to locate at the test site. However, Carlson
explained that his goals in marketing the base were fairly modest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to make a major profit on this,'' he said,
``but we want enough money to be able to continue the service and
drop the cost of operating the test site.''

QUEST _ The death of Professor Jonathon William Faulkner was
accompanied by a curious inheritance left to his students: $1
million for the one who could solve a mystery hidden in his 10-room
mansion. With that fictional premise, a Scottsdale company lured
thousands of computer sleuths into buying a $50 game _ and
competing in an arduous contest that promised $1 million to the
real-life winner. But, two years later, Sirius Publishing Inc. has
transformed its software conundrum into a mystery by refusing to
fully identify the winner. By DENNIS WAGNER. Story will move in the
``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BULLET _ Lynn Andrews was 14 last summer when he was shot in his
throwing arm by a 14-year-old girl. She was angry, Lynn says,
because he would not loan her a rap CD. Like most other shootings
in Arizona in 1997, the attack didn't even make the news. But the
shot from the .44 Magnum changed the lives of Lynn and nearly
everyone around him, showing just how devastating one bullet can
be. By KARINA BLAND. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
VICTIM _ C. Hermanex is a Chandler, Ariz., resident who originally
wrote of her experiences as a victim of domestic violence for her
church newsletter. This is an edited version of the account
Hermanex agreed to share with Republic readers: It could happen to
someone you know. It happened to me. Government statistics say
domestic violence is undereported by 10 to 1. Having experienced
over 40 physical assaults, with only four resulting in arrest and
conviction of the batterer, I guess I fit the statistic. But I am
not a statistic. I am a woman, with a name, a life, a family. Story
will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) _ On occasion, Rev. Jack Spaulding of St.
Thomas the Apostle Catholic Church has delivered messages during
prayer services in a monotone voice, in the first person, as if
Jesus or Mary were speaking directly through him. A parishoner from
St. Thomas mentioned this to me recently, adding, ``I wonder if it
was the Lord who told Father Jack to throw the nuns out of their
convent.'' By E.J.MONTINI. Story will move in the ``A'' and ``K''
categories. &QL;

IT'S POLITICALLY INCORRECT, BUT LET'S HEAR IT FOR `TEAM SATAN!'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the night of Feb. 22, 1980, millions of unsuspecting
Americans were transformed into hockey fans.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them didn't know a blue line from a stretch mark. They
didn't know if Mike Eruzione was the team captain or the kid who
delivered the pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, when a team of overachieving U.S. college kids upset the
mighty Soviet Union in the Olympics semifinals in Lake Placid,
N.Y., people across America cheered and hugged one another with
pride. Hockey had a golden page to add to its memory book.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, today in Lyon, France, the World Cup soccer match between
the United States and Iran will kindle interest, but it lacks the
relative drama of that night in Lake Placid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just concerned with getting the three points'' for
winning, American Ernie Stewart said, echoing the U.S. team's
weekend theme.
</P>
<P>
   From a Biblical standpoint _ certainly, from this corner of the
globe _ the match is not like David and Goliath. It's more like
cold-shouldered Cains and Abels.
</P>
<P>
   From a World Cup standpoint, they make odd bedfellows, paired on
a political rostrum called Group F.
</P>
<P>
   These players were about 10 years old _ most of them _ in 1979
when Iranian militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took
52 hostages. The Embassy is now a police training center, and on
its brick walls outside, the spray-painted message, ``Death to
America,'' is said to be faded and hard to read.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, to ask this team of U.S. soccer players, who fight a daily
battle for recognition on their own, to shoulder the country's
political pride seems grossly unkind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I haven't talked to Bill lately,'' U.S. midfielder Tab
Ramos told reporters in France. ``Does Bill Clinton know we're
playing Iran?''
</P>
<P>
   Ramos' sarcasm is more than called for, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The president's videotaped message set for today, in which he
says he hopes the match can be ``another step toward ending the
estrangement between our nations,'' is the sporting equivalent of a
guy who runs up in the airport and says, ``Here _ deliver this
package.''
</P>
<P>
   Gee, thanks. Can we sell you some D.C. United tickets?
</P>
<P>
   The greater prize remains a place in the World Cup's second
round. The U.S. strikers look labored enough without the extra
baggage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to make this a political game,'' U.S. coach Steve
Sampson told the news media after practice Friday. ``At some point,
we're just going to have to put the other stuff aside.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be no banners, Lyon's gendarmes have decreed.
Security has been stepped up around town. Effigies of Jimmy Carter,
we also assume, will not be gassed and burned.
</P>
<P>
   The coach of the Iran team _ gasp _ even lives in California. He
said he plans a ``surprise'' gesture of good will for the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   I know _ two tickets to Six Flags Over Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it's a joke. We're trying our best to deal with this.
</P>
<P>
   If the Olympics has taught us anything in 2,000 years, it's that
sports and politics have always been intermingled. Jesse Owens and
Hitler in Berlin. The bloody Hungary and Soviet Union water polo
match in Melbourne. The boycott in Moscow, and again in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, the only storyline today would be whether
Stewart or surfer-dude teammate Frankie Hejduk can muster scoring
chances against Iran's Ahmad Reza Abedzadeh.
</P>
<P>
   But we know better. In Tehran, they're praying for an Iran
victory. Defeating the United States, the nation that Iranians
openly call ``The Great Satan,'' will launch a national holiday, if
not holy day.
</P>
<P>
   Although the newly elected leader of Iran, the Mohammad Khatami,
talked about the match being ``a prelude to a new path,'' hardline
newspapers in Tehran reiterated their stands against ``injustices
perpetrated by World Arrogance.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be us, neighbors. Arrogance United, in the Tehran box
scores.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, though, most Americans don't get it. Most Americans
wouldn't recognize the World Cup trophy if UPS left it on their
doorsteps.
</P>
<P>
   There is refreshing naivete, therefore, when U.S. goalkeeper
Kasey Keller said, ``It's nice to get some recognition from the
government. We understand there's a lot of pride at stake in this
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The greater good, Keller knows, is the baggage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it brings more fans to the TV and more exposure to the
sport of soccer, that will be great,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans will be watching today. To them, Team
Satan has a score to settle.
</P>
<P>
   It might be boorish. It might be immensely politically
incorrect. But for U.S. soccer, it's a captive audience. And
there's no 10-run rule.

ANALYSIS: TURNING LEGISLATIVE DEFEATS INTO ELECTION VICTORIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki began the year with a modest
list of things he wanted out of the Legislature: end parole for
violent felons, permit charter schools, allow casino gambling,
toughen penalties for juvenile criminals.
</P>
<P>
   He got none of those. But while the 1998 legislative session,
which ended Friday, may look like a bust for the Republican
governor, it gave him a few handy issues to use as he runs for
re-election this year, particularly the timeworn theme that
Democrats are soft on crime.
</P>
<P>
   He signaled as much in a news conference on Friday afternoon in
which he reviewed a session that was widely seen as one of the
least eventful in memory. Pataki bemoaned the gridlock in the
Capitol, and blamed the Democrats who control the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single criminal-justice change we've tried to get was
fought tooth and nail in the Assembly,'' he said. ``I just think
there are an awful lot of people in the Assembly, particularly the
Assembly leadership, who go back to the old philosophy that it's
society's fault when someone is a violent criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's political advisers calculated that there was not much
he needed, politically, from this session, and they may have been
right. Polls show him with huge leads over his Democratic rivals,
and the governor seemed to spend more time this year touring the
state to promote his record than working in the Capitol to enhance
it.
</P>
<P>
   Even his allies in the Legislature say that except for the
parole issue, he did not break a sweat this year lobbying for his
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   He can tell communities in western New York and the Catskills
that see casinos as their best hope for economic development that
he tried, but he did not push the issue hard enough to raise the
ire of conservatives who oppose gambling. And he can tell minority
communities that favor charter schools that he fought their fight,
only to be thwarted by the Assembly's top Democrats, though the
Republicans who control the Senate were in no hurry to go down that
road, either.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it was a year made for political posturing, and not
just because of the coming election. In years past, lawmakers often
hitched smaller issues to larger ones, giving them leverage to get
more things done.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, for the first time since Pataki was elected in
1994, there were no momentous issues hanging over the lawmakers'
heads, no budget crisis, no plan for deep cuts, no rent controls
ready to expire, no deadline for welfare reform. As legislators
noted repeatedly all year, there was nothing that, for either side,
absolutely had to be done.
</P>
<P>
   In the final days of the session, there were a few notable
pieces of legislation passed, including one requiring that people
infected with HIV be reported to the state Health Department and
their sexual partners be notified. Lawmakers also agreed on a
program of inspections and emissions testing for heavy trucks and
buses, something long sought by environmentalists. And a deal was
struck on the management of the new Hudson River park in Manhattan
that places some limits on development along the river.
</P>
<P>
   For the Assembly Democrats, especially Speaker Sheldon Silver,
the session went much as it did for Pataki. They, too, calculated
that there was not much they needed, politically. They, too,
entered the year with a limited agenda, and in defeat found
election-year ammunition.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pataki's broad budget vetoes in April denied the Democrats much
of what they wanted, including a $500 million increase in spending
on school construction and a tripling of spending on child care.
Silver refused to negotiate with Pataki and the Senate majority
leader, Joseph Bruno, on restoring some of the vetoed items, saying
it was all or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the speaker made it clear that he would rather
have the issue to use against Pataki than have a fraction of the
money back. And as the session ended, Silver kept up his attacks on
the governor with an eye toward the November election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think that the people of this state will recognize
that while Wall Street is booming, Main Street is not booming in
New York,'' he said. ``The governor chose to veto some very sound
proposals that were passed through legislators of both parties.''
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly Democrats called for steps to reduce New York's
auto insurance rates, knowing well that the Republicans would
reject them. Again, even before the session had ended, the defeat
had become a campaign issue, as the Democrats running against the
governor piggy-backed on the Assembly's plans and blamed Pataki for
high premiums.
</P>
<P>
   It was telling that when asked what he considered the major
achievement of the session, Silver cited not a piece of
legislation, but a process: the negotiation of a budget through
public conference committees with the Senate, rather than in
private talks.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat obscured by the furor over the vetoes was the
Democrats' achievement of some of the things they wanted most this
year, including a large increase in basic school aid, expansion of
the state's health care program for poor children, and a process
for people to appeal when their health insurance companies deny
coverage for certain treatments.
</P>
<P>
   And in other areas, they may have inoculated themselves against
attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly passed a criminal-justice package that included the
governor's proposal to end parole, though it also included other
measures that Pataki and the Senate refused to accept. In the end,
no law was enacted, but the Democrats can go home and tell voters
that they, too, voted to abolish parole.
</P>
<P>
   So attractive was that measure as a piece of political cover
that all the Republicans in the Assembly voted for it as well, for
fear that they would be accused of opposing the antiparole measure.
</P>
<P>
   In the final week, Silver offered to work out a compromise in
conference committees, a proposal the Republicans rejected. Of the
governor, he said, ``He believes he has it better as a campaign
issue than as a law, that it suits his purposes.''

IRAN COACH KNOWS U.S. WELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYON, France _ In one of the wilder twists of the most
anticipated, and controversial, matchup of this World Cup, Iran
takes on its most-hated enemy of the last 20 years under the
leadership of a man who has enjoyed all the benefits of life within
the despised land.
</P>
<P>
   Jalel Talebi, who seeks to guide the Iranians past the United
States tonight at Stade Gerland, has spent most of his time since
the Islamic revolution 19 years ago residing in the Bay Area, where
his sons were schooled, his wife runs a couple businesses, and he
has coached at the same junior college in which U.S. coach Steve
Sampson once played and coached.
</P>
<P>
   It's irony of the deepest sort: Iran, which only since moderate
Mohammad Khatami assumed the presidency last summer has eased off
the rhetoric against the `` Great Satan,'' is trusting in a coach
who might not be here had he not departed his homeland and taken up
with the enemy after the Ayatollah Khomeini took power.
</P>
<P>
   His is a crucial job. Iran's emergence from the long, dark veil
of fundamentalism, a ongoing process not nearly finished, has been
exemplified by its success in soccer, and its reaction to that
success.
</P>
<P>
   Its qualification for the World Cup, its first since 1978,
resulted in celebrations Khomeini never would have stood for, with
men drinking in public, women tossing aside their veils to kiss men
in the street, and a mass celebration in the national stadium that
included 5,000 women, who weren't permitted on the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Iranians, especially the young people, see the World Cup as a
chance to rejoin the world community, to show that they contrary to
widely held international beliefs are just like everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   And if anyone embodies that concept, it is Talebi, 53, who was
forced to leave Iran when its war with Iraq, which began in 1980,
put an end to soccer in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a political man,'' he says. ``I am a sport man.'' And
that is the gist of why Palo Alto, and not Tehran, is where he
calls home.
</P>
<P>
   A little background: Talebi played for Iran's Olympic team in
Tokyo in 1964, and turned to coaching when a knee injury ended his
playing career. He was in charge of the Iranian Olympians prior to
the revolution, but found his skills no longer useful once the war
with Iraq began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a Holy War,'' he told U.S. reporters a few days ago
at his team's World Cup headquarters in Yssingeaux. ``Our basic
thought during those eight years was to get rid of the enemy.
During those eight years, sports fell behind. There was no real
game of football in Iran. It stopped. I had to work overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   He took a job in the United Arab Emirates but didn't want his
children schooled in Arabic, so his family was sent to the United
States, to Palo Alto. He joined them in 1983 and has spent most of
the last 15 years there, taking off only for jobs with teams in
Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   He also spent a spell at Foothill College in Los Altos Hills,
where Sampson played and served as an assistant coach. The men met
in 1994, through Bora Milutinovic, Talebi's close friend.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Sira, opened a vegetarian restaurant and a skin-care
business, and his eldest sons, Babak and Borzov, attended local
universities and took jobs in Silicon Valley. His youngest son,
Bardia, just graduated from Palo Alto High School, where he was a
soccer star. He wants to play at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am comfortable (in California),'' Talebi says. ``I have no
problem with anybody. I do my job. I respect the law. I am treated
as everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   He was named ``technical adviser'' to Coach Tomislav Ivic, a
Croat, in May, then took charge of the team on May 21, when Ivic
was canned following a series of poor results. He didn't think
twice before accepting the assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a person to go after a job,'' says Sira, who has
remained in Palo Alto and says she won't watch today's game because
she'll be much too nervous. ``But they asked him, and he said OK.
... He can't say no. He has to. He's an Iranian.''

 &HT;    The privacy snatchers
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Twenty-four-hour video cameras monitor Central Park.
Video cameras keep an eye on ``cruising'' in downtown Atlanta.
Electronic databases track the movies you rent. At a Kids `R' Kids
day care center in Marietta, parents can watch over the Internet to
see how their children are being treated.
</P>
<P>
   Automated gas pumps record where you fill your tank _ and the
kind of gas you use. Video cameras watch for toll cheats on Ga. 400
and keep a wary eye on automatic teller machines. At work, your
boss may be reading your e-mail, counting the keystrokes you type,
or monitoring your phone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Don't like someone looking over your shoulder, prying into your
private life and watching your spending habits? Better get used to
it. Author, futurist and physicist David Brin says we're hurtling
headlong into an era when everyone's life will soon be an open
book.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the Transparent Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``From gnat-sized spy cameras to creepy software agents that
might invade and rifle your files, to untraceable databases to
possible lie detectors and proclivities profiles, the future seems
to offer a plethora of possible ways for others to peer at you,''
Brin says.
</P>
<P>
   Brin has captivated a generation of science fiction readers
conjuring up images of futures that might be in the Hugo
award-winning ``Startide Rising,'' as well as in ``The Uplift War''
and ``The Postman,'' now a Warner Bros. movie starring Kevin
Costner.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest book, ``The Transparent Society'' (Perseus Books,
$25), he's looking at society in transition again. But this book
isn't fiction. And the future is now.
</P>
<P>
   Brin's first major work of nonfiction is a sometimes chilling,
sometimes hopeful and ultimately pragmatic view of a world where
``cameras and databases will sprout like poppies _ or weeds _
whether we like it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's already far too late to prevent the invasion of cameras
and databases,'' he says. ``No matter how many laws are passed, it
will prove quite impossible to legislate away the new surveillance
tools and databases. They are here to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Even someone with as fertile an imagination as Brin admits to
being a little unsettled by the speed at which technology is
pushing an intrusive nose into people's private lives.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for instance, the Transient Electronic Pulse Emanation
Surveillance Technology, a system already in use that enables
electronic sensors to record the contents of any computer screen _
through walls if it's necessary _ up to a half-mile away.
</P>
<P>
   Or take the millimeter-wave imager developed by Pacific
Northwest National Laboratory, now being considered for airport
security systems, which can ``strip search'' a person from across a
room, looking beneath clothing with ease in search of concealed
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Or how about the proposal being studied by the Pentagon's
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency that could take
miniaturization to its logical extreme _ ``surveillance dust'' made
up of small airborne particles that each contain a miniature
parachute and microphone small enough to float on the wind for four
or five hours after being dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Brin says, reality is actually ahead of his fiction.
In his 1987 novel, ``Earth,'' he wrote about a world 50 years in
the future where an autonomous ``courtesy worm'' program named
EmilyPost roamed the Internet, invading computers to admonish
e-mailers and chat room users who failed to exercise proper
``netiquette.'' During his research for ``The Transparent
Society,'' Brin discovered that several such programs had already
been developed, including one named EmilyPost.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, science fiction writers have tended to see the
proliferation of privacy-threatening technologies in Orwellian
terms _ more tools for Big Brother to keep ordinary people under
the thumb. But where others see oppression, Brin sees
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the mighty (governments, big corporations,
criminals and a technological elite) have vast new powers of sight
_ powers that can only grow more advanced and more invisible to
common folk as time goes on,'' he says. Instead of demanding limits
on the use of such technology, he says, the public should demand
access to it, and use it to shine a little light into the dark
corners of governments and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   If high-tech marketers want to profile your spending habits, he
says, insist that you have access to their records as well. If
highway patrolmen carry video cameras to record their arrests,
maybe motorists should too. If Big Brother wants to watch, demand
the right to watch the watchers _ free access for all to
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public should be insisting, `You show me yours and I'll
show you mine,''' he says. ``By letting go of secrecy, we may
ultimately protect some of our privacy. They'll peer at us a lot
less when they know we can look back.''
</P>
<P>
   Brin envisions the democratization of surveillance and
information technology fostering a kind of societywide
``neighborhood watch,'' where the major deterrent against criminal
behavior and government abuse of power would be the near certainty
of getting caught and being held accountable.
</P>
<P>
   In some cities, for instance, residents are recording the
activities of prostitutes in an effort to discourage them from
working their neighborhoods. Megan's Law, the federally mandated
register of sexual offenders, enables police and local residents
alike to identify potential child molesters living in their
neighborhoods. Environmental Protection Agency regulations now make
data on local sources of toxic waste available, too.
</P>
<P>
   New information technology can also help make governments more
accountable. The Internal Revenue Service now uses supervision
software to ensure that its employees do not browse through tax
returns they have no official business seeing.
</P>
<P>
   Brin says a brave new world of electronic vigilantes is bound to
conflict with individual needs for freedom and privacy. Human
nature makes it inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever a conflict arises between privacy and accountability,
people demand the former for themselves and the latter for
everybody else,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But one thing is clear: Increasing the amount of secrecy in
society isn't going to get us there. It will only increase the
shadows for the bad guys to hide in.''

 &HT;    Get ready for the inevitable visit of Windows 98
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Back when I was a kid, the arrival of my Uncle Bill
at our house was a great event.
</P>
<P>
   He lived in Alaska and _ to folks living in Arkadelphia, Ark. _
that was every bit as exotic as if he were a permanent resident of
Mars or Paris, France ... both places seemed about as far away.
</P>
<P>
   The house was cleaned, we stocked up on the sort of food we
usually ate on Sundays, and my brother and I got new blue jeans.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to tell you that Windows 98 is anything as
important as the arrival of my Uncle Bill. After all, he usually
gave us silver dollars and told stories about Alaskan-grown
strawberries that got danged near as big as heads of lettuce. Uncle
Bill was a storyteller and free with his money.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 is merely an operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But some of you will need to get ready for its arrival. You
probably won't need new blue jeans, but you do need to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   As the arrival of Windows 98 draws near, let's talk about how
you can get your computer ready for the newest version of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   I hope you've already taken care of the first item on my list,
adding RAM. All the versions of Windows, including 95, are about as
hungry as a puppy with a tapeworm. Forget all the minimum
requirements and make sure you have at least 32 megabytes. Get 64
if you possibly can. With either version of Windows, RAM works a
lot like a supercharger when it comes to speed. You will notice a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Next you need to take a hard look at your hard disk. Truth is,
even 1-gigabyte disks are becoming too small for folks with a full
complement of programs. The good news is that hard disks _ just as
is true with RAM chips _ are cheaper than ever. The bad news is
that all these cheap prices can sure add up if you need RAM and a
bigger hard disk.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also want to consider a faster modem if you have anything
less than a 56k bps modem. Now what, you ask, does upgrading a
modem have to do with installing Windows?
</P>
<P>
   Besides the fact this is an Internet world nowadays, Windows
uses the Web for a remarkable feature that automatically looks for
updates to Windows itself and then helps you install them. That
means that, if you use the built-in feature, it's less likely
you'll miss an important bug fix or software update. But some of
these updates are huge _ 6 or more megabytes. You'll want to make
the download fast enough to make the process relatively pain-free.
</P>
<P>
   Next, make a quick inventory of multimedia accessories such as
video card, sound card and the like. Windows makes good use of
graphics and sound, but if your computer is more than three years
old, you'll likely want updates here.
</P>
<P>
   One thing I wouldn't worry about is rushing out to buy a new
computer to take advantage of the USB (universal serial bus)
technology. Don't get me wrong. It's neat stuff _ with USB you'll
be able to connect a lot of gadgets to your serial bus without
worrying about conflicts. But you'll be buying a new computer soon
enough, so don't use USB as an excuse. If your PC is at least a
Pentium running at 166 megahertz, it should do just fine with
Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, check your wallet. If you are like most people, you'll
soon need to find about $109 because _ no matter what you think now
_ you'll almost certainly upgrade to Windows 98 within the next
three or four months.

 &HT;    To buy or not to buy ...
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- For most computer users, the burning issue concerning
Microsoft's Windows 98 isn't the one grabbing the headlines _ the
antitrust questions it raises for the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, home computer users are wondering whether they should
be lining up at dawn on Thursday to buy the latest version of
Windows when it officially hits the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Microsoft bills the newest Windows as a much
improved version: faster, less likely to cause your computer to
crash or freeze, and loaded with dozens of new features to make
computing easier and more fun.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as predictably, given the contrary nature of writers and
analysts, the majority of those folks see Windows 98 as a
relatively minor upgrade. It's been called a stopgap release
designed to provide bug fixes and updates that are already
available free for the downloading to Web-savvy users at
Microsoft's site (http://www.microsoft.com).
</P>
<P>
   This is the last in the consumer-grade series of Windows. The
way things stand now, it's unlikely there will be a Windows 2000 or
2003. Microsoft plans to standardize _ something the company is
famous for already _ on Windows NT in upcoming releases. In the
future, there probably will be several versions of NT, Microsoft's
industrial strength version of Windows, which _ up to now _ has
been mostly aimed at businesses and power users.
</P>
<P>
   I've been using the beta version of Windows 98 for several
months and installed an advance copy of the final commercial
version that will be sold in stores for $109. The recommendations
aren't as easy to make as when Windows 95 was introduced. That
program was a clear technical knockout winner when compared to
Windows 3.1, which it replaced.
</P>
<P>
   So you'll have to decide. To better help you make up your mind,
let's take a look at some of the things that set Windows 98 apart.
</P>
<P>
   Look and feel
</P>
<P>
   Most people will be delighted to know that the familiar Windows
desktop hasn't changed much. In fact, unless you watch the Windows
98 startup screen, you'd be hard-pressed to tell at a glance
whether the program is Windows 95 or 98. While those who put a lot
of stock in the way a program looks may be disappointed, most
people will be glad to know that they won't have to relearn
Windows. Unlike the shift between 3.1 and Windows 95, you won't
need the skimpy user's manual to know how to launch programs and
use most Windows features.
</P>
<P>
   Stability
</P>
<P>
   This is Microsoft's biggest selling point _ this Windows is the
most stable yet. While even a few months of everyday use isn't
enough to make any definitive judgments about stability, it does
seem less likely to crash or freeze. The chief complaint of some
analysts _ that this is a minor upgrade _ may actually work in
Windows' favor here. Since it is not a radical redesign, there was
plenty of time to fix problems discovered in Windows 95 and not
enough changes to introduce many new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Installation
</P>
<P>
   Most experienced users know this, but novice computer users will
be relieved to know the installation process is automatic and does
not remove any of the programs or data used under Windows 95. I've
installed Windows on six separate machines and _ with one exception
_ the installations were flawless. The one exception was a PC
connected to a local area network. Apparently, some of the
specialized network software caused problems and _ when the
computer was restarted _ it reported that some of the files needed
for the LAN were missing. However, reinstalling that software and
then reinstalling Windows 98 solved the problem. Expect to spend
about 45 minutes to an hour installing Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   New features
</P>
<P>
   There are too many to list and describe here. But heading the
list of the most important changes is FAT32. FAT is computerese for
``file allocation table'' and describes the way computers and hard
disks keep track of and store programs and data. With this version
of Windows, FAT32 offers a much more efficient method and some
users _ especially those with extremely large hard disks _ may save
hundreds of megabytes of storage space because of the efficiencies
of this new method.
</P>
<P>
   Another nifty feature is the ability of the disk fragmentation
software to change where your programs are stored on your hard disk
based on how often you use each program. By putting the most often
used programs in the best positions, they'll load faster at the
expense of loading time of seldom-used programs. You'll need to use
the defragmentation program several times before you'll notice a
difference but _ over time _ you will see improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the controversial melding of Internet Explorer
and the Windows desktop. That's one of the features that caused the
Justice Department to file the antitrust suit, since new users may
never try the competing browser from Netscape. Using this feature,
you can make launching a program and navigating through the file
system very much like using the Web. You get a more graphical look
and only needto single-click to perform most functions. However,
this feature seems to slow down most computers dramatically and has
not been popular with many earlier users.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, what's the answer to the big question: Do you
line up at dawn on Thursday to buy Windows 98?
</P>
<P>
   A lot depends on whether you enjoy the early morning. Windows 98
itself isn't enough of a change to make that dawn trip. However, it
is a legitimate improvement _ as you would expect from a major
program developed by a company with the resources of Microsoft _
and there's no doubt that most of us will be installing new Windows
sooner or later.

 &HT;    On coast-to-coast hot seat, Linder keeps his cool
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A key election approaching, Rep. John Linder says
he feels no pressure in his job as chief fund-raiser and
cheerleader for Republican congressional campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Then the phone rings in his private office at the Capitol.
``Hello, Newt,'' Linder says.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker is demanding the latest polling data and plans in
New Mexico, where Republicans risk losing a congressional seat and
seeing their small majority shrink from 11 to 10.
</P>
<P>
   The election is ``huge,'' according to Linder, and a potential
harbinger of the November congressional elections, when the outcome
of 20 to 30 key House races will determine whether Newt Gingrich
remains speaker.
</P>
<P>
   A few bad breaks here and there could end GOP control of the
House after four years, though most political analysts still
consider a Democratic takeover a longshot.
</P>
<P>
   Two wild cards could dramatically alter the fall campaigns. One
is the ongoing investigation of President Clinton and the
Democrats, from campaign finance issues to allegations of an affair
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. If independent
counsel Kenneth Starr sends Congress a report detailing wrongdoing
by the president, Republicans could be looking at big gains in
November.
</P>
<P>
   The other unknown is the impact of the tobacco issue.
Republicans believe they can withstand the collapse of
comprehensive tobacco legislation in the Senate. Democrats believe
voters will hold the GOP accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Paxon (R-N.Y.), Linder's predecessor as chairman of
the National Republican Congressional Committee, said the pressure
Linder is under is intense. ``It's probably one of the most
high-pressure jobs in Washington,'' Paxon said. ``He's doing a
terrific job under difficult circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was something less than a vote of confidence when
anonymous sources last month told conservative columnist Robert
Novak, whose columns have served as trial balloons for Gingrich,
that Linder was being set up as the scapegoat for anticipated
Republican losses.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Gingrich brought back Paxon to pry campaign
money from Republican House members for the GOP nominee in New
Mexico, Heather Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Novak's column and rumblings among Republicans on Capitol Hill
prompted Gingrich to write the Washington Post last week, saying,
``I have confidence in the winning ability of Republican ideas and
in Chairman John Linder's ability to continue these trends.''
</P>
<P>
   Linder stands by his prediction of a Republican gain of 10 seats
in November, more optimistic than most analysts and some Republican
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The New Mexico election, to fill the seat held by the late Rep.
Steven Schiff, is the next test. Wilson and Democratic state Sen.
Phil Maloof are locked in a tight race and, whatever the result
Tuesday, they will square off again in November.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides view the New Mexico election as critical. Dick
Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, and Dick Armey, the
Republican leader, are campaigning there this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also are sending Rep. Loretta Sanchez of California to
appeal to Hispanic voters. Jack Kemp, the 1996 Republican vice
presidential nominee, made an appearance for Wilson. Top political
operatives in both parties have been sent to Albuquerque as well.
</P>
<P>
   Maloof, from a wealthy and politically well-connected family,
has paid for much of his race with family money, giving him a stout
advantage over Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   But Paxon, whose ebullience contrasts with Linder's reserve,
said that by the time the election is over, he will have collected
$250,000 to $300,000 from fellow Republicans in the House for
Wilson's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns heating up
</P>
<P>
   Linder won't predict what will happen Tuesday. But he said he is
sure that if the GOP loses, his critics will be out in force. ``I
will not run for the hills,'' Linder said.
</P>
<P>
   He won't have time. The campaigns for the rest of the House will
intensify quickly during the next couple of months. Linder's
practiced calm, a vestige of an earlier career as a dentist, should
serve him well.
</P>
<P>
   Linder's committee has raised more than $50 million, which will
allow it to give the maximum $70,000 to 100 candidates and finance
an array of issue ads that are not subject to Federal Election
Commission limits.
</P>
<P>
   Those ads will counter an anticipated barrage from labor unions
in a couple of dozen districts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As it now stands, both parties are focusing on six to eight
races in California, three each in Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin and a few others across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In most instances, the most fiercely contested elections will be
in districts with no incumbent on the ballot and a rough parity
between Democratic and Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   There are some early warning signs for Republicans.
Conservatives in the House, upset with a lackluster legislative
agenda, had been reluctant to give money to the committee and some
moderate GOP candidates, but Paxon's intervention has helped.
</P>
<P>
   They also were upset that Linder and Gingrich urged a moderate
Republican, Brooks Firestone, to run in a California special
election.
</P>
<P>
   In that race, a more conservative candidate, Tom Bordonaro, beat
Firestone but lost to Democrat Lois Capps.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a schism between the moderates and the
conservatives,'' said Rep. Mark Foley (R-Fla.), who works with
Linder on the congressional committee. ``But I think Linder has
done a remarkable job of reading the tea leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Gingrich is intervening in a primary in Georgia. He is
openly supporting Dylan Glenn, an African-American candidate and
former junior Bush White House aide, against businessman Joe
McCormick, who is white.
</P>
<P>
   Some senior Georgia Republicans said Gingrich's support and the
endorsement of other national Republicans could backfire in South
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will face Democratic incumbent Sanford Bishop. Linder
insisted that his committee has remained neutral despite Gingrich's
support for Glenn. ``That's Newt,'' Linder said. ``That's not
particularly helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Gingrich is complicating things for Linder in South
Georgia, he also is the party's not-so-secret fund-raising weapon.
</P>
<P>
   In several districts, Democratic challengers have raised more
money than the Republican incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   Linder will try to remedy that by sending Gingrich, a legendary
fund-raiser, to some of those districts during the July Fourth
congressional recess.

CLINTON TO CONFRONT CHINA, AS WELL AS ``ENGAGE'' THE ASIAN POWER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton leaves for his journey
through China, he will carry with him a stubborn hope to bring the
Beijing leadership into the world mainstream on many fronts _ from
nuclear nonproliferation to economic trade to greater
democratization.
</P>
<P>
   But the results of the nine-day, five-city trip will be measured
not in the typical markings of diplomatic success _ treaties signed
and accords reached _ but rather in the gradual prodding of China
to open its borders to more US goods and its collective mind to
greater freedoms, all as part of a strategy known as engagement.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the long shadow of controversy over campaign
fund-raising allegations, Clinton will be officially welcomed on
Friday in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, site of the 1989 massacre,
then is expected to make pointed remarks on Chinese human rights
transgressions. He will highlight local democracy efforts in
Chinese villages. He plans to travel to the inland city of Guilin
to call attention to the massive environmental problems facing the
Chinese. And he will address the flagging Asian economy in an
address in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The direction China takes over the next 10 years or 20 years
will fundamentally and profoundly affect our interests, our
children's future, stability in Asia, peace in the world,'' said
Samuel R. Berger, Clinton's national security adviser. ``We have a
fundamental interest in engagement with China, which does not
necessarily mean that we endorse all about China or all of China's
policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Berger: ``We have found that we have made more progress by
looking them in the eye and telling them strongly and firmly what
we believe their obligation is to the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   This marks the first trip of a US president to China since
President Bush traveled to Beijing in 1989, months before the
massacre of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of student protesters on
Tiananmen Square. It is also the longest tour of any one country by
Clinton _ a partial payback, according to administration officials,
for Chinese President Jiang Zemin's 10-day US visit in October.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said Clinton, in tone and substance, will
strive to resemble House Speaker Newt Gingrich in his 1997 visit to
China, rather than Vice President Al Gore in his trip to Beijing
last year. Gore was widely perceived as unprepared and too
laudatory, while Gingrich received many plaudits back home, from
Republicans and Democrats, for upbraiding Chinese leaders on human
rights concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the presidential entourage will include a fleet of 747
jets packed with several hundred reporters, Cabinet secretaries,
White House aides, and other administration officials. The trip
will begin Thursday in the city of Xian, the ancient capital of
China and home to the famed terra cotta soldiers, and end on July 3
in Hong Kong, a symbol of China's potential future.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can show the complex panorama that China has become,'' said
Winston Lord, an assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific affairs in Clinton's first term. ``There are problems, but
there are also positive developments.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those traveling in the entourage will be US Representative
Edward J. Markey, a Malden Democrat and a member of the House
Commerce Committee. Also on the trip will be Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright, Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin,
Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman, and Secretary of Commerce
William M. Daley.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at each stop, there will be questions, not just over
China's actions but over Clinton's motivations.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Washington, Clinton has been accused by Republicans of
accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal campaign
contributions from Chinese agents trying to influence the 1996 US
election. In the last two months, he has been accused of approving
potentially harmful missile-technology transfers to China by Loral
Space &AMP; Communications, a US company whose owner was the single
biggest Democratic contributor in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has since banned such technology transfers. Clinton has
denied wrongdoing, saying he was simply adhering to a program that
was begun by President Reagan and continued under Bush. More than
100 Republican House members, including Gingrich, have demanded
that Clinton postpone his trip until the investigations into the
Loral transfer are completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Loral case brings to the surface a lot of the American
unease about China,'' said Thomas Robinson, president of the
American Asian Research Enterprises, and a professor of national
security at Georgetown University. ``It pulls together the human
rights component, the economic component, and the national security
component.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of concrete accomplishments, the United States is
hoping to sign a pact with China to no longer target each other
with nuclear missiles. Still, even that plan is considered largely
symbolic, because such missiles can be retargeted in a matter of
minutes. China has more than a dozen long-range missiles pointed at
the United States, and the United States has many more aimed at
China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will seek to closely involve China in stemming the
possibility of a nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan,
partly by urging Chinese leaders to sever the flow of missile
technology to Pakistan, and partly by leading through a continued
example of nonproliferation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of what happened in South Asia, there's a real reason
to have this summit,'' said Stephen Yates, a China scholar with the
Heritage Foundation, a Washington think tank. ``China clearly had
an involvement with Pakistan. There was a relationship there.''
</P>
<P>
   Economic officials will continue to laud the Chinese over their
decision not to devalue their currency in the face of economic
turmoil across Asia, and urge them to continue to maintain the
value.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have played an absolutely critical role in maintaining
their currency,'' Rubin said in a briefing for reporters. ``Their
doing so has been an island of stability in otherwise a very
difficult time.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States, citing a $50 billion-a-year trade deficit
with China, will also push leaders to ease import restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president will press during the meeting for China to open
its markets for goods, service, and agriculture as it engages in
the sweeping economic reforms,'' said Gene Sperling, assistant to
the president for economic policy. Sperling said Clinton would
target such key areas as automobiles and chemicals, where tariffs
are especially high.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout the trip, the issues will always range back to
those of human rights, as they did when Jiang visited Washington
last October in the first part of this dual summit. At that time,
at a freewheeling press conference, Clinton and Jiang traded barbs
on the Tiananmen Square massacre. Jiang referred to it as a
``political disturbance'' and said ``the Chinese government had to
take necessary measures.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton shot back: ``The United States recognizes that on so
many issues, China is on the right side of history, and we welcome
it. But on this issue, we believe the policy of the government is
on the wrong side of history. There is, after all, now a universal
declaration of human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   On this trip, complaints have already arisen at home about
Clinton's visit to Tiananmen Square for the official welcoming
ceremony on Saturday. Clinton will be greeted by Chinese leaders in
the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have intentionally scheduled the ceremony
for late Friday night EST, and have scheduled a press statement for
immediately afterward by Clinton at the Great Hall, where he will
issue a proclamation on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly what they have in mind is to try to get in the same
news cycle whatever he can say on Tiananmen and human rights,''
said one official involved in the scheduling.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Michael McCurry said Clinton is
buoyed by the controversy because he believes it will help attract
attention to his mission of engagement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way,'' McCurry said, ``he thinks it's a great opportunity
in getting attacked because it engages people, heightens
interest.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   With most soccer eyes on the World Cup, the Dallas Burn quietly
has been trying to revive its pedestrian Major League Soccer
season.
</P>
<P>
   A rematch with Tampa Bay at the Cotton Bowl tonight offers the
Burn a chance to prove it can win when expected. The game will also
give the Burn an opportunity to avenge an earlier loss to the
Mutiny, and a victory would allow Dallas to start closing the gap
in the MLS' Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Burn is 10 points behind second-place Chicago (10-5, 28
points) and well in back of conference leader Los Angeles (12-2, 37
points).
</P>
<P>
   Two goals by U.S. national teamer Frankie Hejduk helped the
Mutiny (3-12) defeat Dallas, 3-1, on April 11. John Kowalski has
since resigned as Tampa Bay's coach, and Hejduk is starting for
Team USA against Iran in today's World Cup match.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas (8-6) has its own problems and could have up to six
players miss today's match. Alain Sutter, Eric Dade, Jorge Flores,
Richard Farrer and Gerell Elliot could be sidelined by injuries,
and Leonel Alvarez will not play because of an accumulation of
yellow cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy when you don't know who's going to be there each
week,'' forward Dante Washington said. ``You can't blame that,
because we have a bunch of guys capable of starting. But
chemistry-wise, different players bring different things to the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   The Burn's last home game marked the league's most lopsided
match ever, an 8-1 loss to Los Angeles. Disappointing road games at
D.C. United and Chicago followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The D.C. game was tough, in that we were winning late,'' said
Washington, referring to the Burn's 5-4 shootout victory after
leading 4-3 in the final two minutes. ``It was a great outcome,
considering we were coming off the 8-1 loss. The most important
thing was how we reacted to that loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago defeated Dallas on a penalty kick after saving 10 Burn
shots. Dallas also had 11 corner kicks, but the expansion Fire won
its eighth consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight games in a row, I guess you take it when you can get
it,'' Washington said. ``We were all over them, and they got a gift
of a penalty kick. From the way we dominated them, I don't think
we're in that bad of sorts.''
</P>
<P>
   In two-plus seasons, the Burn has strung together no better than
a five-game winning streak, once last season and in 1996. This
year, Dallas started 3-0 but has yet to match that streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Burn has been unable to project any fear factor like that
associated with Los Angeles or D.C. United, Washington said. In
1996, LA started 12-0 and began 9-0 this season. Two-time MLS
champion D.C. has consecutive 13-4 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does a lot for you mentally to get on a streak,''
Washington said. ``You feel invincible. We haven't been able to get
that snowball rolling to where other teams are afraid of us.''

WOODWARD WILL GET PRIVACY _ FOR A WHILE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOREEN IUDICA VIGUE AND RIC KAHN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELTON, England _ As the army of journalists and fleet of
satellite trucks withdraw for now from this quiet village, Louise
Woodward will soon make her way to the local pub and market without
the world watching.
</P>
<P>
   But even those who campaigned to bring home the town's most
infamous daughter admitted that they could never again see her in
the same way, that just below the surface of daily routine and
pleasantries will exist a longing for answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things will be back to normal, but there is always talk and
there will be stares,'' said Marion Barlow, stocking the shelves of
her packed hardware store in the town center Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want to treat her and the family like normal people,
although we all want to ask questions. She won't ever really have
her own life now.''
</P>
<P>
   The young woman who dreamed of becoming an actress is destined
for a life less ordinary, some specialists say. Made famous by a
trial observed around the globe and forever tainted by her
manslaughter conviction in the death of Matthew Eappen, an infant,
Woodward now walks the same path as others who became known for
their misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a person has a label put on them _ such as `the nanny
killer' _ it's very difficult for people's perceptions to change,''
said Northeastern University's Jane Bybee, an assistant professor
of psychology who has written about shame and shunning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if she's exonerated, people will still call her, `the
suspected nanny killer,''' said Bybee. ``The label will follow her
to the end of her day.''
</P>
<P>
   Bybee compared Woodward to celebrity athlete O.J. Simpson,
accused and acquitted of murdering his wife and her friend.
Afterward, Simpson was dumped by his girlfriend, heckled on the
golf course, and snubbed by neighbors. Shutterbugs waited at every
corner, and he contemplated fleeing the country.
</P>
<P>
   While channel-surfing at home last fall, Simpson called Court TV
during its broadcast of Woodward's trial. The fallen football
legend wanted to express his support for the frightened British au
pair _ one outcast to another.
</P>
<P>
   As a convicted felon in a baby's death, Woodward should not
expect that those among the throngs which rallied for her during
the trial will welcome her with open arms if she tries to get close
to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is she going to have a life after this?'' Bybee asked. ``O.J.
is the walking dead. He's still ostracized.
</P>
<P>
   ``People use different standards when considering whether
(Woodward) should be convicted in a court of law than being friends
with somebody and accepting them socially,'' Bybee said. ``Would
you want your children babysat by her or your brother to marry
her?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Like Woodward, Cheryl Amirault LeFave had been just another
ordinary person leading an unobserved life. Then, she, her mother,
Violet Amirault, and her brother, Gerald ``Tooky'' Amirault, were
branded child molesters during the mid-1980s, charged with abusing
children at their Malden day care center.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Her 14-year ordeal then became a roller-coaster ride of
headline-grabbing trials, convictions, and a series of appeals.
Earlier this month, a Superior Court judge overturned LeFave's
conviction, finding that the testimony of child witnesses had been
tainted by faulty interviewing. The state has appealed; if
prosecutors win, she returns to prison.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  LeFave said she lost a lot: eight years of her life in a
prison cell, her mother to cancer, her married life to stress _ and
her good name. She has never fully recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Though she's technically an innocent woman and has been free for
nearly three years, LeFave said she sometimes lies awake all night,
her nerves worn raw by the experience. She said Woodward may have
the same anxieties.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``If it's an unjust conviction'' as Woodward
contends, &UR;  &LR; ``there's never going to be a moment where she's at
peace,'' said LeFave. ``It's a constant haunt ... It's the scarlet
letter.''
</P>
<P>
   LeFave, 40, has said she lives a closeted existence, rarely
leaving her Ashmont apartment, fearful of being recognized.  &UR;  &LR; At a
recent Elton John concert, she realized the joy had been torn from
her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried the entire night,'' she said. ``To think I watched all
those people tap their feet and clap their hands and I have been
stripped of that for the rest of my life ... The drum doesn't beat
in me anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward says she wants to attend college and then get a job.
LeFave said she'd been there, too. She had a steady job as an
airline reservations clerk two years ago _ until a supervisor saw
her on the 6 o'clock news. LeFave was immediately escorted from the
premises.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always become a prisoner of people's perceptions,'' said
LeFave, who is awaiting word on whether the Supreme Judicial Court
will take back her freedom. ``She's going to feel the stares, the
doubts in people's faces. It's crippling. There's not a moment when
you're carefree.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Then again, some say that like a fading athlete grown addicted
to glory, Woodward &UR;  &LR; may miss the constant media attention: cameras
flashing and reporters jostling to get closer to her.
</P>
<P>
   British journalists said last week that although they will soon
leave town, they will return to document Woodward's most personal
milestones: her start in college, her first job, her love
relationships _ and, especially, the birth of a first child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether she likes it or not, she is a famous person,'' said
Martin Dillon, a journalist with the Liverpool Echo, a tabloid
daily. ``The media chase will die down somewhat, but once she gets
a boyfriend, once she gets married and has a baby, the press will
be back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conviction will hang over her forever and will follow her
at each milestone in her life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, minutes after she left Marblehead for Logan Airport
and the flight home to Elton, media trucks and journalists
descended on the English town. Some villagers complained, and
others even crossed the street to avoid reporters. But Barlow noted
that &UR;  &LR; still others have come to realize how vital publicity has
been a help to Woodward, at least financially.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got more support from everywhere because of the publicity
and the cameras in court,'' said Barlow. ``Without it, I am sure
the family would have had to sell their house. The publicity
allowed them to pay for the best defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Left alone, Woodward will probably suffer internal conflicts
between her belief that she's innocent and her court conviction,
British psychologists say.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sidney Crown, a London psychotherapist, believes the
Woodward family should undergo counseling as Louise tries to regain
her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she becomes Saturday's news _ and that's going to happen
very rapidly _ she's then going to suddenly realize that she's not
famous anymore, she's not notorious, and she's just her.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's challenge to adjust will be complicated by the fickle
press, said Dr. Richard Howells, a communications instructor at the
University of Leeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, we were struck by her innocence in the whole
thing and now she doesn't look so innocent,'' Howells said. He
believes Woodward is a victim of the media tendency to ``build
celebrities up and then shoot them down.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, when Judge Hiller Zobel reduced Woodward's
second-degree murder conviction to manslaughter and sentenced her
to the 279 days she had already served, the village of Elton
toasted Woodward with champagne, hailing her as a folk hero who'd
survived rough treatment in a foreign land.
</P>
<P>
   But as she finally arrived here last week _ traveling like
royalty despite unresolved allegations that her family misused her
defense fund _ public opinion on British soil had already shifted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``First Class Child Killer,'' screamed the front page of the
tabloid The Mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Howell said Woodward's upcoming interview with the BBC's Martin
Bashir may swing the public pendulum back to Woodward, if all goes
well &UR;  &LR; _ and, experts added, as long as she doesn't get paid for her
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've grown up an awful lot,'' Woodward said to the world press
on Thursday. ``I hope it changed me for the better, but only time
will tell.''

MILITARY FACES GIANT JOB OF FIXING COMPUTERS
</HEADLINE>
  By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sometime in 1993 _ memories are hazy and nothing was
written down for the public _ the North American Air Defense
Command in Cheyenne Mountain, Colo., conducted a test to see what
would happen to all their computers _ the ones that warn of a
nuclear attack _ on New Year's Day of the Year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   As with nearly all computers, years were designated only by
their last two digits _ ``98'' for 1998, ``99'' for 1999, and so
on. A few engineers were starting to speculate: When 2000 comes
along, the computers would read it as ``00'' and think it was 1900.
What would happen?
</P>
<P>
   What happened was, everything froze _ the screens that monitored
the early-warning satellites and radars and other communications
systems that would detect a flock of missiles or bombers coming our
way. ``It all locked up at the stroke of midnight,'' recalled
Robert Martin, a top computer specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was not present at the simulation, but his life has been
ruled by it ever since. At the Mitre Corp. in Bedford, one of the
leading Pentagon contractors working to solve this problem, Martin
is the ``focal point'' for ``Y2K'' _ the cognoscenti's abbreviation
for ``Year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is hardly restricted to NORAD. The Defense
Department has about 25,000 computer systems _ 2,803 of them
classified as ``mission-critical systems,'' meaning that, without
them, the military could no longer carry out a major mission.
</P>
<P>
   These include computers for ``all kinds'' of weapons, Martin
said, ``the full spectrum,'' from nuclear missiles to a sergeant's
battlefield laptop, as well as the various satellites, sensors,
radars, and communications networks that link them into a unified
fighting machine.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what computers are not affected by the Year 2000 problem,
Martin replied, ``I can't think of many.''
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K problem is now a well-known bug _ the one demon in the
bag of popular millennial nightmares that is based not on
Nostradamus or other mythic apocrypha, but on hard science.
</P>
<P>
   Every federal agency, bank, and major corporation has teams
devoting thousands of manhours to solving the problem in the next
18 months, before the deadline inexorably strikes.
</P>
<P>
   But the military may be the hardest hit, because the
consequences could affect not just paychecks and power grids, but
war and peace.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials are hopeful that they will fix at least all
the critical systems in time, but they admit it will be a close
call, at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Year 2000 problem is the electronic equivalent of El
Nino,'' Deputy Defense Secretary John J. Hamre told the Senate
Armed Services Committee two weeks ago. ``This is going to have
implications in the world ... that we can't even comprehend.''
</P>
<P>
   Other countries' militaries could be especially devastated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We at least have a program to deal with the problem,'' noted
Bruce Blair, a nuclear-weapons specialist at the Brookings
Institution. Most countries ``have nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Pentagon, only four countries _ the United
States, Britain, Canada, and Australia _ are doing anything to
prepare their military computers for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Hamre said the situation is so grim that the Pentagon is
developing a program to share data from US early-warning satellites
with other countries, including Russia and China. Otherwise, come
2000, such nations may find themselves in the dark, uncertain
whether an attack is coming or not _ which, in a crisis, could
provoke great anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, who has interviewed several Russian nuclear officers,
said Russia faces particularly dire straits. Since its army has
collapsed, it is relying far more on its nuclear weapons for
security. And, because of shortages in manpower and money, its
nuclear weapons are becoming increasingly vulnerable and its
early-warning network more riddled with gaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K is just a piling-on of a whole nest of problems,'' Blair
said.
</P>
<P>
   Top Pentagon officials did not become fully aware of the problem
until October 1995, during an interagency meeting called by the
Social Security Administration. The agency had been performing its
own simulations, which showed that Year 2000 glitches could cause
millions of citizens to stop getting their retirement-checks _
perhaps even expunge their names from the records _ because the
computers, ``thinking'' it was 1900 instead of 2000, would conclude
that all these beneficiaries were way too young to qualify for
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   That meeting resulted in a directive, sent to every relevant
office in the Defense Department, to address Y2K as a top priority.
By the end of next year, $1.9 billion will have been shifted from
various weapons programs to prepare for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 2,803 ``mission-critical'' computer systems, the Pentagon
reports that 812 _ 29 percent _ are fixed, and most of the rest are
being renovated.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hamre testified, the program is four months behind
schedule _ not a small matter, given that 2000 is 18 months away.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Mitre's Martin explained, is that some of the fixes
are taking much longer than anyone could have estimated.
</P>
<P>
   The solution, for most computers, is for programmers to go into
the software code and do one of two things. Either they change the
symbol for years from two digits to four digits (for example, from
``00'' to ``2000''). Or, they change the code so that the computer
reads year-numbers greater than ``50'' to mean the 1900s _ and
smaller than ``50'' to mean the 2000s.
</P>
<P>
   One problem, however, is many of these computers are old and
nobody who is still around knows what the code is. ``That's a big
problem,'' Martin said, ``finding the code.''
</P>
<P>
   Even once that problem is solved, Hamre warned the Senate,
``there is no guarantee all ... systems will be free of risk.''
</P>
<P>
   First, the commercial computer industry might not be able to
supply the large quantity of hardware _ the communications hubs,
routers, and servers _ needed to make the fixes.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the fixes themselves need to be tested and de-bugged _
which, as anyone who has purchased a software program during its
first weeks on the market knows, can take a while.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, military computers interact with each other and with
civilian computers _ and these interactions could unfold in
unforeseeable ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a web of connectedness,'' Martin noted. If even one
connection in this web has a Year 2000 problem, the whole system
becomes ``a house of cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, it is not entirely predictable just how any given
house of cards might collapse.
</P>
<P>
   When the Chrysler Corp. conducted a test of its Y2K solutions at
an assembly plant last year, the time clocks malfunctioned, causing
the security system to shut down, making it impossible for anyone
to leave the building.
</P>
<P>
   When the Phillips Petroleum Co. ran a simulation onboard an oil
vessel in the North Sea, a safety system designed to detect a
deadly gas, hydrogen sulfide, shut down.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, real-life failures have taken place that only
begin to hint at how far-flung the problems might be.
</P>
<P>
   A preview of possible military disasters was the incident in the
1991 Gulf War, when a Scud missile blew up a barracks in Saudi
Arabia, killing 28 National Guard troops inside.
</P>
<P>
   A post-mortem of the disaster revealed that the Patriot
air-defense battery failed to shoot down the Scud because the clock
in the Patriot's radar system was not properly synchronized.
</P>
<P>
   The radar had been designed to be left on for only a short
while. Its clock viewed a day as 23 hours and 59 minutes long.
However, once this particular Patriot arrived in Saudi Arabia, the
radar was left on continuously. So its clock drifted away from the
actual time by one minute per day.
</P>
<P>
   When the Patriot system's computer detected an incoming Scud
missile, it would see the missile on two radar screens and send
both blips to another computer controlling its fire-control system.
But since the two blips were not synchronized, the fire-control
computer could not connect them _ could not see them as a target.
</P>
<P>
   The Scud tragedy illustrates why the clocks and calendars inside
computers matter so much.
</P>
<P>
   John Pike, a weapons specialist at the Federation of American
Scientists, explained: ``Systems generally require
time-synchronization in order to talk to each other. A lot of
systems use time-synchronization as a way to establish data
links.'' So, if one computer says it is 1900 and another says it is
2000, ``they can't talk to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of ludicrous that Y2K should be a problem,'' Pike
said. ``I mean, two digits in a software program? Causing
catastrophes of these magnitudes?''
</P>
<P>
   Hamre put it another way in his Senate testimony: ``If we built
houses the way we build software, the first woodpecker to come
along would destroy civilization.''

BIG BIRD'S ARRIVAL ONLY ONE EXAMPLE OF CHINA'S CHANGES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Clinton, get ready to meet Da Niao.
</P>
<P>
   Da Niao, as millions of children in China know, is Big Bird's
cousin. In a modern Shanghai television studio, ``Sesame Street''
has just finished producing 130 half-hour shows in Mandarin. The
show will soon be syndicated across China, sponsored by General
Electric.
</P>
<P>
   This is not your father's Red China. In fact, the country that
President Clinton will see this week barely resembles the country
that hosted George Bush for the last American presidential visit
nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Bush visit, China has developed commodities markets
and stock exchanges. Satellite dishes are everywhere. So are
personal agendas, personal computers, personal trainers, and almost
anything that stresses individual, not communal, growth.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky Fried Chicken _ KFC, that is _ is a popular lunch
joint. Chinese cities have private clubs, night clubs, strip clubs,
and book clubs, but the books are all about amassing capital, not
honoring Chairman Mao's dictums.
</P>
<P>
   In China, the ultimate sign of status may be a Bloomberg
terminal, spewing out streams of data about the world markets 24
hours a day. A new book, ``Big Dragon: China's Future _ What it
Means for Business, the Economy and the Global Order,'' says that a
fast-selling magazine, Strategy and Management, aims to be China's
equivalent of the Harvard Business Review. That's not surprising,
except that some of the magazine's investors apparently are
associated with the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush saw China, most of the population had been shaped by
Mao, who had died 13 years earlier. But today's Chinese have
distant memories, if any at all, of Mao and the Cultural
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Burstein, an investment banker from Weston, Conn., and
co-author of ``Big Dragon,'' recently visited a family in Shanghai
for dinner. When he asked the 16-year-old daughter about her
ambitions, she responded ``Stanford,'' the university she hopes to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, that conversation would have been
unimaginable. Instead, as Burstein puts it, a teenage girl would
have said, ``My goal is to integrate with the workers, soldiers,
and peasants and build the revolutionary China.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Dragon'' itself is an example of the change. Next month it
will be published in China, after a bidding war among several
Chinese publishers. The book calls for good relations between
Washington and Beijing, but it does include a few criticisms of
China's leaders. In the 1980s, such a work would have been banned
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   No, this isn't Communist China. But what is it?
</P>
<P>
   Burstein calls the system ``market socialism'' or ``state
capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: President Jiang Zemin, the army, and security
services ensure that the newfound freedoms go only so far.
</P>
<P>
   While China has loosened some restrictions on speech, there is
strong evidence that the ``re-education through labor'' camps are
expanding.
</P>
<P>
   And to prepare for Clinton's nine-day, five-city visit, China
has conducted extensive sweeps of dissidents, jailing some,
threatening many, and shipping others far away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been all too common for them to send people on vacation
before a visit by a president or American officials,'' said Stanley
Roth, the State Department's top Asia expert.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Roth insists that economic openings in China are leading
to some political openings. China blocks dozens of sites on the
Web, but plenty of information from exiles still comes through.
There are fledgling environmental groups. China holds relatively
free local elections.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Big Bird's gangly cousin. Five years ago, the
producers of ``Sesame Street'' went to China _ home to 200 million
children _ for exploratory talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had this feeling that everything would be very closed, but
that lasted about 30 seconds,'' said David Jacobs, a vice president
of Children's Television Workshop in New York.
</P>
<P>
   During those meetings, Jacobs said, Chinese television
executives and educators quickly launched into frank discussions
about what they liked and disliked about their society. ``Sesame
Street,'' called ``Zhima Jie,'' was soon up and taping.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese had a few special requests. They wanted to give
preschoolers an early appreciation of Chinese opera and art. And
because China's one-child policy has created a country full of sons
and daughters who are often spoiled, Big Bird's cousin and several
newly minted Muppet characters put extra emphasis on learning to
share.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agreed that ``Zhima Jie'' should emphasize education
and avoid becoming too commercial. Nevertheless, commercials will
be shown before and after the show when it airs across the country.
</P>
<P>
   And because this is the new, consumer-driven China, store
shelves will soon offer books, videos, and toys featuring the
6-foot-tall yellow bird and his Mandarin-speaking pals.

Mexico gladly accepts draw after trailing Belgium 2-0
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BORDEAUX, France _ Most of the time, ending a game with a tie is
like kissing your sister.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, it was like kissing the sky.
</P>
<P>
   This time, after one of the more remarkable comebacks of the
World Cup thus far and a tying goal that was nothing if not
spectacular, it was like the entire Mexican team ascending the
Azteca pyramids, sweaty and exhausted, and thanking the heavens for
a divine effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there is hope, there is a chance,'' said Mexican forward
Cuahtemoc Blanco, whose diving, awkward 63rd-minute chip-in
provided the 2-2 tie with Belgium. ``Even if hope looks like it is
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   All hope definitely seemed gone for Mexico at steamy-hot Stade
Lescure on Saturday. Belgium stormed to a 2-0 lead, the Mexicans
were playing a man short because of a questionable red card and
every legitimate Mexican opportunity was being kicked away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked dead,'' Mexico's Claudio Suarez said.
</P>
<P>
   But the heat kept rising. The vocal Mexican fans kept yelling _
``Mexico, Mexico, rah-rah-rah.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mexico's attacking game ultimately took over, with a
well-earned penalty kick by Alberto Garcia-Aspe and Blanco's
highlight-reel goal setting off another wild celebration by Mexican
fans.
</P>
<P>
   The tie clouded Mexico's hopes of advancing out of the tough
Group E, which includes the favored Dutch, who defeated Korea on
Saturday. A win would have assured a trip to the single-elimination
second round.
</P>
<P>
   Now tied with the Dutch with four points, while Belgium has two
(with a pair of ties) and South Korea none, Mexico must earn at
least a tie with the Dutch in order to keep its chances of
advancing since Belgium likely will beat South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   But considering how things began Saturday
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy,'' Mexican coach Manuel Lapuente said. ``It was
very difficult for us today from the beginning. We were playing
very well, but getting the red card I thought it would be
impossible to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The red card came against Mexico defender Pavel Pardo in the
29th minute, and by most accounts it was a questionable
interpretation of the back-tackle rule, which FIFA president Sepp
Blatter ruled should be an automatic red card and disqualification
from the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was called,'' Pardo said. ``I don't know how right it was,
but it was called.''
</P>
<P>
   The call clearly devastated Mexico. Only minutes later Belgium's
Marc Wilmots put his team ahead with an easy boot into the back of
the net off a corner kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were forced to change our tactics,'' Lapuente said. ``With
11 on 11, against anyone we attack. But 10 on 11, we had to be
careful.''
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, Blanco said he told teammates to quit playing so
tentatively. But only three minutes into the second half it looked
as if Belgium would walk away with the victory when Wilmots got his
second goal on a nice individual effort to get clear in the Mexican
box and unleash the untouchable shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we should have won this game,'' Belgian coach Georges
Leekens said. ``When Belgium is up 2-0, Belgium should win.''
</P>
<P>
   But Belgium didn't, thanks to a terrific effort by Ramon Ramirez
in the 55th minute that ignited his team.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez tried to take a pass in front of the Belgian goal and
work the ball past goalie Filip De Wilde. But as DeWilde tried to
converge on the ball before Ramirez could get off a shot, Belgium's
Gert Verheyen also crashed into Ramirez, clipping his heel from
behind.
</P>
<P>
   Verheyen then received a red card from referee Hugh Dallas of
Scotland and Garcia-Aspe whipped in the penalty kick to make it
2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``From that point, we could be Mexico again,'' Mexico's Luis
Hernandez said. ``We kept going and going forward. It was
tremendous to show that we had character and we had spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   From the 56th minute on, Mexico dominated control of the ball
and took several legitimate shots.
</P>
<P>
   The game-tying goal by Blanco was a thing of beauty, with
Ramirez taking the ball on a big run directly at the Belgian
defense, then chipping the ball across to Blanco.
</P>
<P>
   The pass went long, well over Blanco, but Blanco dove feet-first
and whacked the ball with his left foot in front of De Wilde and,
well, then it was the raucous Mexican fans who went wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very good game for us, even though we wanted the
win,'' Blanco said. ``It looked like we were going to have an
unlucky day, but we turned it around. We were in trouble, but we
got out of it. It looked like we were not going to get anything,
but we got a point. That was great.''

MARLINS BEAT METS, 8-3  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After tossing six shutout innings in Miami last
Sunday, Hideo Nomo said he could not remember his best performance
of the season. Suffice it to say, Nomo will surely be able to
recall better days than Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   With 44,355 fans on hand at Shea Stadium for a souvenir bat
giveaway, Nomo could not find home plate. In his five-plus innings,
he not only walked six batters, but he also could not hold onto a
3-0 lead in a game he and the Mets would eventually lose, 8-3, to
the lowly Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   In case no one has noticed, the Mets are slumping. Badly.
Instead of energizing the almost-full house on Saturday, the Mets
let another game slip away to one of the worst teams in the
National League. In the last eight days, the Mets (38-31) have lost
six times to Florida and Montreal, including their last four in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   By trading for Mike Piazza on May 22 and then for Nomo on June
4, the Mets were not only trying to shore up their roster for a
post-season run, but also trying to change a popular perception
that they were an adequate but boring team without any marquee
players.
</P>
<P>
   But any team _ exciting or mundane _ that aspires to make it to
the playoffs simply cannot afford loss after loss to
salary-challenged teams like the Expos and the Marlins. If the Mets
keep it up, they may quickly chase away the fans they were hoping
to lure back to Shea.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the six losses to the Expos and Marlins, the Mets
have had the lead _ sometimes late in the game, sometimes early,
sometimes in the fifth or sixth inning. In some of the losses the
problem has been a bullpen that has turned extremely shaky. In
others, it has been the normally stellar starting pitching that has
broken down. And in almost every instance, the Mets have been badly
served by an offense that just does not score many runs.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo _ who has yet to win in three starts with the Mets _ was
almost down by 4-0 Saturday before the first inning was over. But
Wayne Kirby, who started in center field, reached up at the wall in
left-center and grabbed Derrek Lee's drive just as it was about to
become a grand slam. And then the Mets scored three times in the
third off Livan Hernandez, the first run driven in by Nomo on a
bases-loaded walk.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Manager Jim Leyland was ejected from his perch in the
dugout one pitch later, having lobbed a few choice words toward the
home-plate umpire, Dana DeMuth. Edgardo Alfonzo, who had three
hits, followed with a two-run single to right to give Nomo a 3-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the Marlins roared right back to tie the game in the third
with a two-out rally, highlighted by Todd Zeile's two-run homer
that bounced off the top of the right-field fence. Nomo walked
three Marlins in the inning, including Craig Counsell with the
bases loaded, to give the Marlins a 3-3 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo then held the Marlins scoreless until the sixth, when
Counsell led off with a full-count walk and Hernandez singled him
to second after having fouled off two consecutive bunt attempts. On
came Brian Bohanon, who ended up throwing a wild pitch to enable
Counsell to score the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins added two more runs in the seventh, although the
Mets cut down another run at the plate on a Matt Franco-to-Rey
Ordonez-to-Mike Piazza relay that began at the left-field fence.
Then Mel Rojas, who is in as bad a funk as anyone, gave up a pair
of runs in the eighth, raising still more questions about a bullpen
that does not have a right-handed reliever the Mets can depend on.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, the Mets were left wondering if it is a slump
or something more. Is it any wonder that Ruben Sierra was signed to
a look-and-see minor league contract Saturday? Even with Piazza,
these Mets have no punch _ especially in their outfield. And when
the pitching is not there _ and it was not there Saturday _ the
Mets are in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo is now 2-8 with a 4.95 earned run average. As a Met, he is
0-1 with a 4.50 e.r.a. He allowed 7 hits Saturday in his 97 pitches
and has now allowed 73 hits in 832/3 innings. Most distressing this
season has been the walks, 50 of them in all, an average of 5.4 per
game.
</P>
<P>
   The interleague series with the Yankees is five days away. The
Mets can only hope things get better before then.

POWER TIES REGAIN STRENGTH IN FASHION CIRCLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- There's a new power surge in the neckwear
business.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are more men buying more ties this year -- menswear
sales are up 6.7 percent nationwide -- but there's a return to the
power tie, which we last saw in the mid-'80s. Then it was a
pale-yellow silk print, and now it's a woven, 18-karat-gold-colored
design reflecting the renewed interest in luxury goods.
</P>
<P>
   And you thought hemlines were the only barometer of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking, the better the economy, the wider the
tie,'' said Tom Julian, trend analyst for Fallon-McElligott, a New
York-based advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
   But ties, like hemlines, are only a gauge, and the world's
excitement over the end of the millennium has thrown market
watchers a curve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ties are getting wider, up to 4 inches (they reached 5 inches
in the '70s), but it's not just a matter of width,'' Julian said.
``There's an emphasis in looking modern yet retro, reminiscent of
the Hollywood glamour of the '40s.''
</P>
<P>
   And fashion followers are still studying the stars. Instead of
Cary Grant or Fred Astaire, it's Harrison Ford, ``NYPD Blue'' star
Jimmy Smits and ``The Practice'' star Dylan McDermott who have
generated tie sales, report fashion experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Younger men are most excited about power ties because it's a
whole new experience for them,'' said Leon Hall, spokesman for The
Fashion Association and host of the E! channel's ``Fashion
Emergency.'' He added that although the ``casual Friday'' concept
has stirred up the menswear market in recent years, it's also had a
backlash effect that's got men dressing up again.
</P>
<P>
   He said the colored shirt with matching solid-color tie that was
so hot last year fueled the fire. But soda-pop colors like lime,
lavender and pale orange are cooling off, and deep jewel tones in
classic stripes and small prints -- still paired with blue or
earth-toned dress shirts -- are the big news now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called professionalism,'' Hall said. ``Casual Friday may
be OK on Fridays in some offices, but I don't want to see my banker
or doctor dressing less serious than I am. It undermines
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The local business scene agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely more interest in dressing up,'' said Megan
Jordan, spokeswoman for Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in
Panorama City, a Los Angeles suburb. ``It's come from the top and
is being picked up by anybody aspiring to management.''
</P>
<P>
   She attributed the overall trend to Kaiser's new management,
which has created a new-found pride in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' Jordan added. ``I'm noticing men talking to
each other about their ties . . . which are often gold or blue with
an iridescent sheen to them, worn with a matching shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Power ties at Rocketdyne Propulsion &AMP; Power in suburban Canoga
Park, which is now affiliated with Boeing, are also glowing in
gold, but shades of red still mean business, said company spokesman
Dan Beck. He was quick to add that Rocketdyne is not exactly a
tie-wearing company, but he wears one, and favors woven styles with
a '40s flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our company, traditional stripes and prints like a subtle
paisley are good,'' Beck said, ``but novelty prints would be
frowned upon and regarded as too frivolous.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it's a relatively casual atmosphere, anybody wearing his
best suit and power tie would make people suspicious that he had a
job interview at lunch, Beck added.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of job interviews, Hall said a dark suit, white dress
shirt and rep (striped) tie or subtle woven design works best for
almost all professions. ``It shows you're serious about the job,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Gregory, a menswear buyer for Nordstrom stores, agreed
with Hall but said that in a creative or fashion field, she'd
expect prospective employees to be more edgy in their attire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be most interested in the man who shows up in a French
blue shirt with the season's power tie -- a woven design in either
gold or burgundy,'' Gregory said. ``And while tonals (solid colors)
are still strong, stripes are newest.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie ``The Hucksters,'' Clark Gable said, ``Give me a
sincere tie -- I'm on my way to a very important meeting in my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a concept that attorneys such as Christopher Keosian, a
civil litigation and bankruptcy attorney with Keosian &AMP; Keosian of
Century City, near Beverly Hills, understand and utilize in their
client's best interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attorneys will dress to impress other attorneys because they
want to look successful . . . and maybe get referrals,'' he said.
``While some (attorneys) use the Johnnie Cochran theory (remember
his flashy ties?) to impress the jury with how successful they are,
my goal is to be a friend to the jury. For instance, I'd choose a
less bold, more friendly tie, maybe with stripes, but definitely a
conservative Brooks Bros. type.''
</P>
<P>
   A plaintiff attorney, Keosian said he advises his clients to
dress similarly, making sure the tie isn't too flashy, such as a
polka-dot design, because it conveys a liberal, risky person. The
best choice? It's usually a conservative striped tie with a white
shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Now that ties are wielding power again, take a look at that old
white oxford button-down shirt.
</P>
<P>
   The staple of preppy dressing, it was never designed to be worn
with elegant suits. Fashion experts will tell you it's meant to be
worn with summer seersuckers, navy-blue blazers and rep ties, or
worn tieless with khakis on casual Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   To show that new power tie to its best advantage, Nordstrom
buyer Gregory advises shoppers to look for dress shirts with a
spread collar or ``curved spread'' to accommodate the bigger knot
that the woven tie makes. To make the knot look its best, she
suggests using a four-in-hand instead of a half-Windsor, making
sure the tip of the tie ends at the belt buckle.
</P>
<P>
   And keep your '70s tie tack in the drawer. It's still tacky.

STEWART KEEPS A STEADY GRIP ON THE LEAD  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Through 54 demanding holes at the U.S. Open,
Payne Stewart has never allowed himself to crack.
</P>
<P>
   While others have double-bogeyed, tripled-bogeyed, succumbed to
fits of frustration, or surrendered to the torturous conditions at
the Olympic Club, Stewart has found ways to persevere. When play
ended Saturday night, Stewart was the lone player under par, and he
had never worked so hard to keep a red number next to his name.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken some of the best golf of Stewart's career to take a
four-stroke lead into Sunday's final round. And if Stewart can hold
on, after winning just once on the PGA Tour during the last seven
years, this victory would rank as his sweetest. Standing at
two-under-par 207 for the tournament after Saturday's even par
round of even-par 70, Stewart held a four-stroke lead over Tom
Lehman and Bob Tway.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Janzen and Nick Price were tied for fourth place at two
over, still close enough to make a final-round charge, especially
if Stewart finally falters.
</P>
<P>
   But those waiting for Stewart to succumb to the pressure may be
waiting a long time. Stewart was the last first-round leader to win
the U.S. Open, when he won in 1991 at Hazeltine National Golf Club
in Chaska, Minn. Stewart has led after all three rounds this year,
and after Saturday's steady performance, he seemed confident
heading into Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much have to do the same things I've done up to this
point _ hit fairways, hit greens and hole some putts,'' Stewart
said after Saturday's round that included an eagle, a birdie, and
three bogeys. ``It's not over. It will be hard for somebody to go
out and shoot a low number to catch me. But if I stumble a little
bit, I could let a lot of people back into the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Stewart will be chased by formidable players. The cream rose
to the top Saturday, and the top five contenders are all former
major winners. Lehman is the 1996 British Open champion. Tway won
the 1986 PGA Championship. Price has won four majors in his
brilliant career, most recently the 1994 PGA Championship. And
Janzen won the 1993 U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, who shot a 68 Saturday, will be the sentimental favorite
among the gallery. From 1995 through '97, Lehman ended the third
round of the U.S. Open either alone in first place, or tied for the
lead. Yet he has never won the championship that he wants the most,
and he sounded almost relieved that he will not start Sunday with
the lead again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm not leading, the pressure is more on the other guy,''
Lehman said. ``It'll be somewhat different, and maybe it will
better for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting the day at three under par, one stroke ahead of Tway
and Jeff Maggert, Stewart never lost the lead. He started with an
eagle on the first hole, reaching the par-5, 533-yard first hole in
two shots, then making an 8-foot putt. After a bogey on No. 3,
Stewart answered with a birdie on the par-3 No. 8, when he hit his
tee shot to within five feet, then made the birdie putt. Stewart
bogeyed No. 9 and No. 15, but he made pars the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the competition was spinning its wheels just trying
to stay close. Maggert hurt his chances badly Saturday with a 75 to
fall three over par for the tournament. Tway had a chance to tie
Stewart for the lead at four under par, but he missed a birdie putt
on No. 6. Tway followed with a bogey on No. 7, then he missed the
fairway at No. 9, leading to a double-bogey that dropped him to
even par, and back with the rest of the contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Janzen remained in the hunt after a 73 on Saturday, but he also
had a costly double-bogey (No. 17). Price was very steady, shooting
a 71 on Saturday, and keeping himself close enough to give himself
a chance on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the pre-tournament favorites will not win this weekend.
Ernie Els, the defending champion, is out of contention at 10 over
for the tournament. Phil Mickelson (eight over) will not win his
first major championship on Sunday, nor will David Duval (eight
over) or Colin Montgomerie (11 over). Tiger Woods (seven over par)
was well out of contention as well.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Sunday should be pressure-packed, especially for the final
twosome of Stewart and Lehman. After making a double-bogey at No.
18 on Friday, Lehman left the golf course an angry man, admitting:
``I was as angry as I've have ever been walking off a golf course.
I had to apologize to a couple of people for biting their heads
off.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday, he managed to regroup, making birdies on the
first three holes, then keeping his poise after making bogeys on
the next three. Lehman ended the day on a high note with a birdie
on No. 18, and he looked forward to another Sunday at the Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun, but it's not fun like going to Six Flags is fun,''
said Lehman of pressure at the Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience is fun. The competition is what's fun. But I
don't think anybody looks forward to being nervous all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet so far, Stewart has battled his nerves and the course with
success. And if he could do it again, he would have a sweet reward.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I won last time, I tried to live up to expectations,'' he
said. ``This time, I''ll enjoy it more.''

<P>
   Globe editors and librarians have reviewed 364 columns by Mike

   Mike Barnicle has written more than 3,500 columns for The Boston
Globe since 1973. His style has sometimes been controversial and he
has collected a good number of critics and enemies over the years.
But that does not justify linking him with the misdeeds of Patricia
Smith. For those who would attempt to do so, I would urge great
caution.

7 DEAD, 18 HURT AS BUS HITS PARKED TRUCK  
 (HLW)

   NEW YORK _ A Greyhound bus driver on his last scheduled run was
killed early on Saturday, along with his wife, his 8-year-old son,
and four other passengers, when their bus crashed into a
tractor-trailer parked on the Pennsylvania Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, Milton Scott Wisner Jr., 61, a 10-year Greyhound
veteran, was on his last trip for the company, said its chief
executive, Craig Lentzsch.
</P>
<P>
   The accident happened shortly after 4 a.m. on a mountainous,
rain-slicked part of the turnpike about 50 miles west of
Harrisburg, Pa. The bus, carrying 23 people from New York City to
Pittsburgh, crashed into the rear of a tractor-trailer parked on
the shoulder, near a tunnel. The accident injured 18 people,
including 2 who were asleep in the truck cab.
</P>
<P>
   The names of the other victims, including Wisner's wife, who was
56, and his son, were not released. The authorities said some might
not be identified until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The injured included a 34-year-old man from Elmhurst, N.Y., who
was listed in critical condition at the Washington County Hospital,
in Hagerstown, Md. A hospital representative declined to reveal the
man's name. Another person was listed in stable condition at the
hospital and 16 were treated for minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday afternoon, the police were still investigating the
crash. Greyhound officials declined to speculate on a cause, but
dismissed a theory that the driver might have fallen sleep. The
officials said that the company followed strict federal highway
safety regulations that permit employees to drive only 10 hours in
a 24-hour period and 70 hours in an eight-day period.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a normal run and this is an experienced driver,''
Lentzsch said, ``and it's really too early to draw any
conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   A Greyhound spokesman, George Gravley, said Wisner's personnel
file had been sent to the National Transportation Safety Board,
which is investigating the accident along with a team from
Greyhound.
</P>
<P>
   Wisner began his last run on Thursday night, when he drove from
Pittsburgh, his home base, to New York City. He arrived in New York
early Friday morning and spent 13 hours in the city before heading
out to Pittsburgh at 9 p.m. on Friday, Gravley said.
</P>
<P>
   The tractor-trailer was parked on a wide shoulder, a mile west
of the Tuscarora Tunnel. The road was wet from rain earlier in the
morning. Lt. Richard Kovalik of the state police said it was common
practice, and legal, for trucks to pull off the road onto the
shoulder.

Astros rally for another win
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Another day, another game with more twists and turns than a Slinky.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Elarton's shot at winning his major-league debut got
caught up in a tangled mess created by the bullpen, but the elastic
Astros refused to break in their 22nd come-from-behind victory of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Hot-hitting Carl Everett's three-run double capped a four-run
eighth inning and sent the Astros on their way to a wacky 9-8
victory over the Cincinnati Reds Saturday afternoon at the
Astrodome. Billy Wagner surrendered two runs in the ninth but held
on for his 18th save of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, who moved to 17 games over .500 for the first time
since 1994, have won 12 games in their last at-bat this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done it enough times that there is an expectation of
success,'' manager Larry Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   But this game hardly had the look of a typical Astros comeback
when Elarton, 22, left with a 5-2 lead and two runners on with one
out in the seventh. Instead of zapping the life out of the young
Reds, the Astros' bullpen resuscitated Cincinnati's hopes by
blowing the lead and putting the offense on call for more
late-inning magic.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch hitters Craig Biggio and Ricky Gutierrez started the
eighth-inning rally. Biggio was hit by a pitch, and Gutierrez
singled, bringing Bill Spiers to the plate to face Rick Krivda
(0-1). Spiers brought Biggio home on a single to right, tying the
score at six.
</P>
<P>
   Righthanded reliever Scott Sullivan got flyouts from Brad Ausmus
and Derek Bell before intentionally walking Jeff Bagwell to bring
Everett to the plate with the bases loaded. Reds manager Jack
McKeon summoned closer Jeff Shaw from the bullpen, but he was no
match for Everett, who is hitting .393 in his last 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most managers try to put the psychological pressure on you by
walking someone and loading the bases to get to you, but that
didn't disturb me at all,'' said Everett, who has 17 RBIs during
his 14-game tear. ``As far as I was concerned, the pressure was all
on (Shaw).''
</P>
<P>
   If there was pressure on Elarton, he didn't bother to convey it
to the 24,301 fans, including several family members, who showed up
for his coming-out party. The rookie righthander pitched well
enough to win, holding the Reds to five hits in 6 innings while
striking out nine and walking just one.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton retired 16 of the 25 batters he faced, setting down the
side in order in three innings. Dierker lifted him with the tying
run at the plate, assuring the rookie would get nothing worse than
a no-decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really pleased with the way Scott pitched,'' Dierker
said. ``I probably should have let him stay out there a little
longer, but on any ordinary occasion, we save that game for him,
and he gets his first major-league win.''
</P>
<P>
   So Dierker put Elarton's fate in the hands of the bullpen, which
dropped it like a stick of dynamite. The Reds exploded for four
runs in the seventh, thanks in large part to an overall lack of
control by the Astros' bullpen, which allowed five hits, four runs,
two walks and a hit batsmen in its 2 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first time in a long time that our guys have had
trouble throwing the ball over the plate,'' Dierker said. ``No
matter who I tried, the results were the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker needed three relievers to get out of the seventh inning.
Mike Magnante, who inherited runners at first and second, allowed a
single and bases-loaded walk to the two hitters he faced, and
Reggie Harris walked the only batter who stepped to the plate
against him, forcing in another run. C.J. Nitkowski (3-2), who
pitched a perfect eighth and got the win, allowed an RBI single to
Mike Frank to tie the score and with two out put the Reds ahead 6-5
by hitting Willie Greene with the bases full.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we would have liked to give Scott a win,'' Magnante
said. ``But that's the same as with any of our starters. That's my
job, plain and simple. This was probably the biggest failure of the
season for me, because this one cost us the lead. Lucky for me, our
offense is so phenomenal late in games. It was just a messed-up
thing today. (Dierker) had to use three of us in one inning, and
none of us did a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Elarton sat down the first four batters he faced with ease,
changing speeds and spotting the ball like a veteran. Dmitri
Young's second-inning double to center was the Reds' first hit of
the game, and Bret Boone singled him home to give Cincinnati a 1-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros put Elarton back in a comfort zone with four runs in
the third. Bell had an RBI single, and Bagwell connected for a
towering three-run homer off Reds starter Brett Tomko. It was
Bagwell's 12th home run of the season and the 199th of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Larkin's solo homer in the fourth brought the Reds within
4-2 before they took the lead during the Astros' seventh-inning
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty comfortable after the first couple of innings,''
said Elarton, who allowed four earned runs. ``Before that, my hands
were shaking a little. I knew I was probably coming out after I
allowed a couple runners to reach base (in the seventh inning). It
would have been nice to get the win, but we won the game, and
that's all that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds made one final push in the ninth, getting two runs on
three hits against Wagner, who coaxed a double-play ball from
Greene to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't have been that interesting in the end,'' said
Wagner, who allowed his first career runs against the Reds. ``But
the bottom line is that we won. Now, we just have to keep it
rolling.''

ANGELS BEAT RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Steve Sparks has proven to be a mystery to the Texas
Rangers twice in the past week, and even his Angels teammates are
still trying to figure out where this guy came from.
</P>
<P>
   The knuckleball pitcher gave up three runs and five hits in 6
1/3 innings to lead the Angels to an 8-3 victory over the Rangers
Saturday afternoon before 31,671 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   With the win, the Angels avoided falling behind the Rangers in
the A.L. West standings, instead increasing their lead to 1 1/2
games. Anaheim has won 17 of its last 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks (2-0) made his Angels debut last Sunday in Texas and got
his first major league win in almost two years. But it didn't take
him nearly that long to get another.
</P>
<P>
   After allowing three runs in the first inning -- two coming in
on Juan Gonzalez's 23rd homer -- Sparks settled down and held the
Rangers scoreless before being removed with one out in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Angels took advantage of an erratic Todd Van
Poppel, the former No. 1 pick of the Oakland A's who began this
season in double-A. Van Poppel (0-1) lasted only two-plus innings
and got the loss. He gave up four runs and five hits, walking five.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad hit Van Poppel's first big league pitch since Sept. 27,
1996 off the right field foul pole for a first-inning home run, and
the Angels didn't stop there. Dave Hollins (two-run double in the
third) and Phil Nevin (two-run single in the eighth) had the
Angels' other big hits.
</P>
<P>
   However, the day belonged to Sparks, who didn't figure to be
much a part of this Angels team. But with injuries to three
starting pitchers, Sparks became the Angels' best option.
</P>
<P>
   He missed all of 1997 as he recovered from reconstructive elbow
surgery, but was 0-8 in the minors this season. However, other than
his record, his numbers weren't that bad, and manager Terry Collins
noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know anything about him, Collins said. ``I read the
minor league reports every day, and I recognized his name. I knew
he had pitched in Milwaukee and that he was a knuckleballer. I
talked to the triple-A manager and he said he's doing pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   Two starts later, and Sparks is the difference between first and
second place.
</P>
<P>
   Nevin has caught Sparks in both games, and the two seems to be
getting along just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea he was in this organization until they told me a
few days before he pitched, Nevin said. ``I asked Terry who are we
going to call up to pitch. He said Sparks, the knuckleballer. I
said, `Oh, great.'
</P>
<P>
   The key for Sparks on Saturday was that the Angels were able to
rally from a 3-0 deficit. They scored three in the bottom of the
first and three more in the third to go up, 6-3. With a lead,
Sparks didn't have to be so careful with his pitches, which helps
him avoid giving up too many walks. Sparks walked four in the first
three innings, but none after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm at my best when I'm able to throw my fastball
more, said Sparks, who estimated he threw about 70 percent
knuckleballs Saturday. ``Especially when you've got a lead, you're
trying to keep baserunners off base.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sparks himself admits his return to the majors has come
more quickly than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Mr. (Bill) Bavasi (Angels GM) asked me before spring
training when I'd be ready to pitch in the big leagues, I said my
goal was to be ready by July sometime, Sparks said. ``But while I
was at triple-A, I felt I had pretty good command of my
knuckleball.

NEVIN ADJUSTS TO KNUCKLEBALLER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Phil Nevin continues to get a crash course on the art
of catching, and no more so than in the two games he has caught
when knuckleballer Steve Sparks has been on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Nevin has done well -- Sparks and the Angels have won both games
and Nevin did not allow a wild pitch or passed ball in either game
-- especially when one considers Nevin only began learning to catch
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to catch a knuckleballer, said Nevin, who began
his career as a third baseman with the Astros. ``You never know
where it's going. You're basically back there with no clue where
it's going to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``My approach is to stay relaxed as possible and not track it
all the way in. That's why you see some guys stabbing at the ball.
Just let it come to you.
</P>
<P>
   By winning Saturday, the Angels have guaranteed themselves their
hold on first place after today's series finale with the Rangers.
It's nice, but manager Terry Collins won't get carried away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get too hung up in the standings at this point, he
said. ``But they're all big. Last week in Texas was huge. To go
into Texas and win three (out of four) showed them we're capable of
playing with them. It made us relax. I really believe that made
this week easier.
</P>
<P>
   Only one Angel began the day Saturday among the American
League's top 10 hitters. Darin Erstad? No. Jim Edmonds? No.
</P>
<P>
   Ranking 10th in the A.L. in hitting was shortstop Gary Disarcina
at .322.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina, who hits ninth in the lineup, had a .253 career
average going into this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd better have somebody who can hit ninth in this league,
because you got your big hitters coming up behind him, Collins
said. ``He not only gets hits, he's come up with big hits. Last
year we saw him get hot, but I don't think I've seen him spray the
ball around like he has this year.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina's best season at the plate was in 1995, when he hit
.307 in 99 games before sustaining a season-ending thumb injury.
</P>
<P>
   There have been marriage proposals at the ballpark, but rarely
if ever has there been an actual marriage ceremony. But during the
top of the sixth inning Saturday, a couple got officially married
just above the first base dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony was brief -- it took place while the Rangers' Will
Clark was batting. By the time Clark grounded out to second base,
the bride and groom were hitched.
</P>
<P>
   If it seems that the Rangers have an inordinate amount of Angels
castoffs on their roster, it's because it's true. Texas currently
has six former Angels:
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Mark McLemore (disabled list), second baseman
Luis Alicea, first baseman Lee Stevens and pitchers Matt Perisho,
Todd Van Poppel (spring training '97 only) and Scott Bailes.

RUMORS FLYING AROUND FOX'S TEAM IN TURMOIL

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Will Brunson officially became a Dodger on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He is a side-arm left-hander who has been with the organization
since 1995, but as he sat on the team bus waiting to go to the
ballpark, he looked like the rest of the organization _ not sure
what he was doing there.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out Brunson was brought up late Friday from Triple-A to
take the place of Bobby Bonilla, who went on the 15-day disabled
list with a viral infection. Bonilla has been hospitalized and
isn't expected to be released until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On a lesser scale, Brunson was similar to his new manager Bill
Russell, who is wading through an on-field mess while hearing there
is a pink slip awaiting him at home.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone from clubhouse guys to broadcasters to middle relievers
are starting to check their 401K plans to see if they are secure
financially.
</P>
<P>
   To say the new Fox-run Dodgers are in transition is like saying
Ramon Martinez has a sore arm. Although the sale of the team was
approved in March, there has been a lot of denial until now.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, no leadership has emerged from the blockbuster trade
that sent Mike Piazza out of town, but if you believe talk radio,
he's going to re-sign with the Dodgers in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   More oddities:
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield is a splendid player, but too quiet to steer this
ship. Raul Mondesi looks great in center, less great on a side
street in Glendale at 2 in the morning. Eric Young has had a bad
leg for a month, making that four-year, $18.5 million contract at
the expense of acquiring a closer questionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know I think things are really good here, better than
ever,'' said Bonilla, who marked his one-month Dodgers anniversary
with a .170 batting average. ``Change can be hard on a team. But
believe me, the mood on this team is very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, executive vice president Fred Claire told the
players he was running the baseball operation in his ``I am the
man'' speech.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, he said making any trades would have to be cleared
with club president Bob Graziano and the Fox people.
</P>
<P>
   If that isn't confusing enough, many people in the organization
believe former manager Tom Lasorda, in an attempt to regain some
power, has been planting stories about Russell's firing to
illustrate the chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda's relationship with Claire never was very good. Russell
used to be a loyal servant and late-night eating buddier once said
left-hander Omar Daal could be the next Mike Cuellar. Just more of
that Greg Brock/Duke Snider nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   But Didier, now director of player personnel for Arizona, might
be on to something with Daal, the former Dodgers farmhand, although
Cuellar won 20 games four times with Baltimore and the 1969 Cy
Young Award.
</P>
<P>
   Daal, who starts for Arizona today at St. Louis, had a
career-high nine strikeouts and a shutout through eight innings in
a 5-1 victory Tuesday night at Cincinnati, his first career
complete game. In his previous start, he beat the Angels 4-1 on
four hits in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Daal's 2.82 ERA would be tied with the Mets' Mosato Yoshii for
No. 10 in the National League, but he was 101/3 innings short of
qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks selected Daal in the second round of the
expansion draft as a starter, but he could not beat out Joel
Adamson in the spring and began the season in the bullpen, entering
the rotation May 5 after Adamson suffered a shoulder injury.
Arizona is 5-3 in his eight starts.
</P>
<P>
   Daal has taken awhile to get here, going 10-2 in the winter
league in his native Venezuela in 1995-96 and 9-1 in 1996-97 as a
starter. Before this year, he had nine previous career starts in
parts of six big-league seasons with the Dodgers and Montreal
Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Reed can't be replaced: Under normal circumstances, Mets
right-hander Rick Reed would be an easy All-Star selection for
Marlins manager Jim Leyland, especially after Reed had a perfect
game for six innings Friday against Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue isn't his numbers. It's the lingering memory of
his role as a replacement player with the Cincinnati Reds in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Reed is 8-3 with a 2.38 ERA, fourth-best place in the NL,
although those aren't even his best numbers. Reed is second in
batting average against (.205), walks per nine innings (1.6) and
on-base percentage against (.243). He trails only Greg Maddux and
teammate Al Leiter in slugging percentage allowed with a .307 mark.
Reed is second in hits per innings (.74) and baserunners per nine
innings (8.3 to Maddux's 8.1).
</P>
<P>
   His strikeouts-to-walks ratio is 3.94 (67:17), which is third
behind Maddux and Curt Schilling, and in walks per nine innings
he's fourth at 1.64.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pitched like an All-Star,'' manager Bobby Valentine said.
``So has Leiter and (John) Franco. I think Rick's very deserving.''
</P>
<P>
   But none of those numbers or endorsements stopped Wade Boggs
from taking a shot at Reed when the Devil Rays were in New York
recently. When asked about Reed's effectiveness in a 3-0 win over
Tampa, during which he also had a perfect game for 62/3 innings,
Boggs _ who had Tampa's first hit _ said, ``He's a scab and a
career minor-leaguer. If he's so good, why wasn't he up here (in
the major leagues) sooner?''
</P>
<P>
   Those remarks were conveyed to Reed, who said, ``I don't want to
get into it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Franco, the Mets' union rep, did, saying, ``If you want to
be a better person, you learn to move on. For most of us, that's in
the past. Maybe Boggs was mad because he just one hit off Rick, but
I can tell you everyone in the clubhouse supports him. I'd go to
war with him. I've got his back, and I know he's got mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros take off: Jeff Bagwell's seasonlong slump and Derek
Bell's recent slide may finally be over.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell, the former NL MVP, hit only .247 in April and .234 in
May and was hitting less than .200 with runners in scoring position
until the past two weeks. Bell hit .398 in April but dropped off to
hit only .208 during May. Now both appear to be on the verge of
getting going.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes me longer than most guys to work out of a bad
habit,'' Bagwell said. ``I don't want to say I'm completely back,
but I have seen some good signs lately. In the past, when I started
getting hits to the opposite field that's usually meant good things
are about to start happening for me and hopefully that's the case
this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell hit his 12th home run Saturday, and Bell has been
batting over .400 for much of June.
</P>
<P>
   When Bagwell returned from the disabled list, Astros manager
Larry Dierker inserted Bill Spiers in the second spot in the order,
and dropped Bell to third, Bagwell to cleanup and Moises Alou
(.325) to fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Baggy came off, I started seeing more fastballs,'' Bell
said. ``When he was out, guys were pitching around me.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened?: When Cincinnati's Brett Tomko defeated the
Dodgers late last season and again during the first weekend in
April, he looked like a budding star. His manager, Jack McKeon,
said Tomko had the stuff to win 20 this year, just his second in
the majors.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, hasn't happened. After giving up six runs in 21/3
innings Monday in a 13-2 loss to Houston, Tomko entered his
Saturday start against the Astros 5-6 with a 5.03 ERA. A little
more than a month ago, he was 5-1 with a 2.98 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Tomko also has given up 10 home runs in his last nine starts. He
allowed only one in his first five. In his last six outings, which
includes five losses and a no-decision, Tomko has given up 32 runs
(30 earned) in 301/3 innings _ an 8.90 ERA. He hasn't won since May
13.
</P>
<P>
   Tomko has worked to improve his shaken confidence by reading a
book on the mental art of pitching, but it hasn't been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,''' Tomko said. ``They all tell me it's a
phase and I'll get through it, but it's tough to swallow when
you're going out and getting your brains beat in. I know I'm not
this bad. I know the people that are important (McKeon and Reds
management) aren't going to lose confidence in me.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McKeon maintains his belief in the pitcher the
Reds believe will eventually mature into a real ace.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just running through a streak,'' McKeon said. ``I think
he's got good enough stuff to be a pretty good winner in this
league. Sometimes, guys like that lose confidence. It comes back to
them. We're certainly not going to give up on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin could fly: Robin Ventura could be entering the final six
weeks of his White Sox career. But if the Sox plan to trade the
potential free-agent third baseman, general manager Ron Schueler
isn't saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not talking to any clubs about Robin right now,'' Schueler
said. ``And I'm not scouting any teams for that purpose. I'll get a
spot call, some team will say that if we're trying to move him,
keep us in mind. But then I hang up.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Schueler's position, the White Sox have made no attempt
to re-sign Ventura. His agent, Johnny Boggs, said he has not had
any contact with owner Jerry Reinsdorf or the Sox since an
unproductive meeting in spring training. Ventura is believed to be
seeking a four-year deal for $32 million.
</P>
<P>
   Schueler said he's ``kind of surprised'' the cross-town Cubs
haven't called about Ventura. The Cubs sent down promising Kevin
Orie last month and his replacement Jose Hernandez made three
errors in Friday's 12-inning loss to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura wants to stay in Chicago but says he hasn't given any
thought to a move to the Cubs. ``As long as I'm a White Sock, I'm a
White Sock.''

SHORT HOLE STYMIES BROOKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Fort Worth resident Mark Brooks watched his
chance to move into contention during the third round disappear
with a triple bogey at the 288-yard seventh hole, the shortest
par-4 at the Olympic Club.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks pulled his drive into a bush, forcing him to take an
unplayable lie. His recovery shot kicked into the rough and Brooks
eventually three-putted for a seven. After playing the first six
holes at even par, Brooks was 6 over on the final 12, dropping to
12 over for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played the short holes poorly. That really hurt,'' said
Brooks, who also took one of only five bogeys recorded at No. 1, a
533-yard par-5 that played to a tournament-low scoring average of
4.58. Another bogey came at No. 10, a 422-yard par-4.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' third-round highlight proved to be an 18-foot chip-in
for birdie from the rough surrounding the 13th green.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a tough week,'' said Brooks, who survived the cut at
his first major championship since winning the 1996 PGA. ``I didn't
have a lot of confidence coming in. But even if you did, you were
still going to have problems here.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks agreed with fellow pros who have criticized the U.S. Golf
Association's course set-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``About every third year, they miss the boat in trying to make
the winner shoot around par,'' Brooks said. ``If you're in the
rough, more than half the lies here are total luck around the
greens. There's not much skill involved. You just make a slash and
go at it.''
Nicklaus, Woods fade Jack Nicklaus, who survived the cut in his
42nd Open with a 40-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole of Friday's
round, ran out of magic yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I visualized a 65. That was in my mind until I passed it on
the 17th fairway,'' said Nicklaus, who shot a 73 and dropped to 10
over.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, meanwhile, opened with a birdie and did not take
another in his final 17 holes. He registered consecutive bogeys at
Nos. 3 and 4, then parred in to shoot 71 and drop to 7 over.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those weeks where I can't keep anything
going,'' Woods said. ``Everything will go perfect for four holes,
then my swing goes away. Or I'll make everything for a few holes
and then I'll four-putt.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who did not three-putt during his victory at the 1997
Masters, has two four-putts and three three-putts on his card at
the 1998 Open.
Rolling with Casey Perhaps appropriately, disabled golfer Casey
Martin played the third round with the only player in the field who
might have an inkling of what his physical condition would be like:
Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal.
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal's career was presumed over in 1996, when he was unable
to walk 18 holes without severe pain because of what was initially
diagnosed as severe arthritis. Eventually, Olazabal's condition
improved and he returned to the European Tour in 1987 after an
18-month absence.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who suffers from a rare circulatory disorder that makes
it difficult for him to walk, was granted a federal court order in
February allowing him to use a cart in competition at professional
events.
</P>
<P>
   Before the round, Olazabal joked with Martin about letting him
ride in the passenger's seat. Although he said he ``feels
sympathy'' for Martin, Olazabal made it clear that he disagrees
with the U.S. court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a chance to play and was told that I would be able to
use a buggy,'' Olazabal said. ``I declined the invitation. I think
that walking is part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin termed the pairing ``ironic'' and said the two exchanged
nothing but pleasantries throughout 18 holes that ended with
Olazabal shooting 71 and Martin fashioning a 74.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew about his foot problems, so I thought it was ironic
that we played together,'' Martin said. ``But we're in totally
different situations. He's almost 100 percent and I never will
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Told about Olazabal's anti-cart stance, Martin shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't seem bitter at all,'' Martin said. ``He was very
congenial.''
Briefly After omitting the driver from his bag in the first two
rounds, John Daly unleashed it yesterday on six holes. He hit a
390-yard drive on No. 6, setting up a birdie, and drove the green
at the 288-yard seventh hole. Off the seventh tee, Daly used a
3-wood.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Perry recorded the first hole-in-one of the tournament by
knocking a 6-iron into the cup at the 176-yard 13th hole. It marked
his third career ace in tournament competition but his first at the
Open.

LEHMAN HAS NEW FINAL-ROUND VIEW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Tom Lehman plans to make good on an old debt
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, who frittered away the 54-hole lead at the past three
U.S. Opens, finds himself in position at the Olympic Club to win
again. With a five-birdie, three-bogey 68 that matched the lowest
score in yesterday's third round, Lehman will play in the final
twosome at the Open for a fourth consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, he will play the role of the hunter instead of
the hunted. Lehman, at 1-over par, stands four strokes behind
leader Payne Stewart, who remains the only player under par (3
under) through 54 holes at the 6,797-yard, par-70 layout.
</P>
<P>
   The role reversal, he said, could prove beneficial. But Lehman
downplays suggestions that he is overdue to win an Open after
finishing third, second and third, respectively, the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this tournament owes me one. I think I owe
myself one,'' Lehman said. ``The past is not something that haunts
me, so I don't think thatUs really too big a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Lehman relishes the chance to be the one playing with
nothing to lose during the final round at the Open while someone
else handles the mounting pressure of maintaining a lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Payne having a four-shot lead, that makes it easier for
everybody else to feel a little less pressure and, therefore, shoot
a good round,'' Lehman said. ``When you're sitting on the lead ...
you're so nervous that you want to throw up. Those fairways look
like theyUre an inch wide. And I think, therefore, that if youUre
the leader and all you have to do is put the ball in play, it's
still a very tall task.''
</P>
<P>
   It proved to be more than Lehman could handle at Shinnecock
Hills Golf Club (1995), Oakland Hills Country Club (1996) or
Congressional Country Club (1997), where the former Colonial champ
burst from the pack with third-round efforts of 67, 65 and 68,
respectively. Factor in yesterday's effort and LehmanUs third-round
scoring average for the past four years is 67.
</P>
<P>
   His average final-round score for the past three years, on the
other hand, is 72.7. Playing without pressure, Lehman hopes, will
help him close with an effort more like the one he turned in
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman started with three consecutive birdies, all after
approach shots inside 15 feet. Over the next three holes, he
surrendered all three strokes, taking bogeys after drives into the
rough. But he rebounded with a chip-in birdie at No. 14, followed
by a six-foot birdie putt at No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   That one, he said, was especially crucial from a mental
standpoint after four-putting the 18th green to conclude his second
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked off the 18th ready to take somebody's head off. I
walked off the 18th feeling pretty good,'' Lehman said. ``I'm not
sure what it is about me and the third round. I knew if I
maintained my composure and kept my head, I could get back in the
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's time to try to make good on a long-standing debt. To
himself.

 TAKE-BOS 
(Undated): ... top editors
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robinson ``had told me he had talked with Helen (Donovan) and he
had seen disturbing inconsistencies in (Smith's) column,'' said
Moore. ``Basically, we said `This looks troubling, but we've got to
be sure.'''
</P>
<P>
   When Robinson's crosschecks of voter registration records,
telephone databases, the Registry of Motor Vehicles and other
sources did not turn up some individuals mentioned in the columns,
top editors decided it was time to discuss the matter with Smith.
So Moore set up a lunch at 1:30 p.m. last Wednesday at the Royal
Sonesta Hotel in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   The managing editor's memory of the fateful meeting is vivid.
And so is his recollection of an eerie moment. After Smith sat
down, she told Moore what her horoscope had said that morning: ``Be
careful in dealing with your boss today. Misunderstandings could
lead to the loss of a job.''
</P>
<P>
   After some conversation, Moore told her that ``you can't believe
everything you read in the horoscope, but ...'' and he handed Smith
a list of a half-dozen names and asked her to verify their
existence.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of two hours, Moore said, Smith went from
defensive to silent and finally to reflective. She admitted that
four of the people were figments of her imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know why I'm telling you this, but it sure
feels good,'' Moore quoted her as finally saying. ``She apologized.
She said she didn't mean to hurt anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The four fabricated characters include: the cancer patient
Claire; a worker named Jim Burke who was erecting barricades for
the Boston Marathon; a cosmetologist named Janine Byrne, who was
commenting on the case of kidnapping defendant Stephen Fagan; and a
woman named Dorothy Gibson whose young daughter was getting a
painful hair makeover for Easter. Burke and Byrne are basically
supporting characters in those columns, but Claire was the heart of
the column and the fact that Gibson didn't exist cast doubt on the
entirety of that column. All four columns were published in April
and May of this year.
</P>
<P>
   When Moore returned from his meeting with Smith on Wednesday
afternoon, a top-level meeting was convened with him, Storin,
Donovan, Mulvoy and Managing Editor/Administration Louisa Williams.
At that point, the decision was made to seek Smith's resignation,
address the staff, and publish a story explaining what had
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had, in effect, given her a second chance,'' said Storin.
``There wasn't going to be a third.''
</P>
<P>
   At noon on Thursday, less than 24 hours after the Moore-Smith
meeting, Storin told a stunned Globe staff that one of the paper's
top stars had flamed out. Obviously, each fabrication ``violates
the sacred trust that the Globe has with its readers,'' he said.
``This is a painful time for both her and the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of that day, Smith had agreed to resign. And the next
morning, the Globe published her farewell column. In it, she said
she had violated one of the ``cardinal sins of journalism: Thou
shall not fabricate. No exceptions. No excuses.'' She explained
that because she did not get that ```correct' start in journalism,
I set out to be 10 times as good by doing 10 times as much ... But
I didn't establish priorities, and the first casualty was time.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Globe staffers thought the first half of her column was
contrite and the second half was mostly defiant.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those colleagues and readers who salivated daily at the
thought of my head on a platter,'' she wrote, ``congrats.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Back in 1982, when he was managing editor at the Globe, Storin
remembers checking on the accuracy of a Barnicle column about
opening day at Fenway Park. It turned out to be fine. And ``during
the time I have been editor of this paper,'' he said, ``I have had
no reason to doubt the authenticity of Mike Barnicle's columns.''
</P>
<P>
   But questions about whether Barnicle embellishes his column have
percolated over the years, with matters really heating up in the
early '90s. A primary catalyst was Dershowitz's charge that
Barnicle had manufactured a sexist and boorish quote about him in
1990. When the Harvard law professor went on television at that
time to invite anyone else who'd been similarly treated to step
forward, it unearthed the story of a Dorchester gas station
proprietor who sued for libel over a 1973 column, claiming that
he'd never made a racist statement Barnicle attributed to him. The
case had ended with the Globe paying the plaintiff a total of about
$40,000.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, Boston magazine began a column checking
the authenticity of some of Barnicle's columns. And in a 1991
column on the Dershowitz case, then Globe ombudsman Gordon McKibben
concluded that ``the way the hoary quote is inserted at the end of
the column ... invites skeptics, including me, to marvel at
Barnicle's confidence in his recall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly was a good amount of scrutiny in connection
with the Dershowitz column,'' said John S. Driscoll, who was Globe
editor at the time. Driscoll also recalled requiring Barnicle to
divulge the names of sources when he was writing about the Charles
Stuart/Carol DiMaiti Stuart murder case in 1990. Driscoll explained
that he required that Metro columnists be edited at the managing
editor level, but he didn't indicate that there was any
fact-checking system in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never found him guilty of fabrication,'' said Driscoll.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Winship, who was Globe editor from 1965 to 1984, said the
``Globe had no alternative but to accept Patricia Smith's
resignation,'' adding that ``as for Mike Barnicle, I always have
had every confidence in his performance on my watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulvoy, who has been ``the last reader'' of Barnicle's column
since the early 1980s, says ``if something seemed wild I would ask
him or Jack (Driscoll) would ask him. But that was rarely the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In all my dealings with Mike over the years, I don't believe I
ever thought he was fabricating material,'' said Mulvoy. ``If I
did, I would have said so. I just think from what I know that there
have been a lot of unfair assaults on his integrity in the last 24
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Friday, Barnicle said he had not
``violated the trust, faith and confidence I hope my readers have
placed in me. This is a sad time for the paper and Patricia Smith.
It is particularly despicable that a pack of parasites has been
participating in a feeding frenzy over the misfortune of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as the Globe rechecked 30 months' worth of Barnicle
columns, editors heard the charges that Smith was cashiered for
something Barnicle has been accused of. On Friday, Dershowitz
suggested the Globe might be guilty of a double standard rooted in
``race, gender, and ethnicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Editors at the paper ``are aware of allegations of a double
standard,'' said Storin. ``We believe our actions in Patricia's
case were fully considered and fair. We would respond in the same
way in any other instance involving the same issues.''
</P>
<P>
   As he reflected on the ``tragic development'' that befell both
the Globe and Smith in recent days, Storin said, ``Sure, hindsight
is 20/20. I also believed I played the hand I was dealt.''

THE GLOBE, COLUMNISTS, AND THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH
</HEADLINE>
 2TAKES (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly three years ago, Boston Globe editors first saw evidence
of the fabrication problem that culminated in columnist Patricia
Smith's resignation from the paper on Thursday. But she was given a
second chance, in part, because Globe Editor Matthew V. Storin was
concerned that the paper had never really ``addressed ... head on''
lingering accusations that columnist Mike Barnicle had also
included false information in his pieces.
</P>
<P>
   (In the wake of a Globe review of all of Barnicle's columns
since 1996, Storin Saturday expressed confidence in Barnicle's
integrity. (See accompanying story, Page A28)).
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Smith, 42, an award-winning columnist, well-known poet, and a
prominent local voice on racial issues, resigned after admitting to
inventing characters in four 1998 columns. On Friday, the Smith
episode ensnared Barnicle when Harvard law professor Alan
Dershowitz accused the Globe of ``a double standard'' for not
similarly disciplining Barnicle for a 1990 column that Dershowitz
said contained a fabricated quote.
</P>
<P>
   Dershowitz said the quote attributed to him, ``I love Asian
women, don't you? They're ... they're so submissive,'' was fiction.
The dispute was highly publicized at the time and neither the Globe
nor Barnicle ever acknowledged the quote was concocted. On Friday,
Barnicle said he had ``never violated the trust my publisher has
placed in me'' in 25 years as a Globe columnist.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems clear that Storin _ who left the Globe in 1985,
returned in 1992 and became editor in 1993 _ was concerned about
Barnicle's reputation when questions about Smith's 1995 columns
first came to his attention.
</P>
<P>
   Storin said that when possible problems with Smith surfaced
several years ago, she ``entered the framework'' in which the
long-standing questions about Barnicle existed. ``I knew going way
back that people said Barnicle made things up. ... To the best of
my knowledge, the paper had not addressed the Barnicle questions
head on. I had this very talented black woman. ... How then can I
take action against this woman under this circumstance?''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of moving formally against Smith at the time, Storin
gave the Globe's three Metro columnists _ Barnicle, Smith and
Eileen McNamara _ the ``rules of the road'' governing accuracy in
the columns, and established a more formal editing and monitoring
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was put on equal footing,'' said Managing Editor
Gregory L. Moore. ``And the clock started ticking then.''
</P>
<P>
   When Assistant Managing Editor Walter V. Robinson, who initially
flagged the possible 1995 Smith fabrications, identified new
concerns earlier this year, it triggered the chain of events that
ended with Smith's stunning departure.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was in charge of local news when Smith got her column
in 1994. ``I championed her becoming a Metro columnist at this
newspaper,'' he said. ``She was an extraordinary voice.'' (Smith
was not available for comment for this story.)
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in late 1995 or early 1996, Robinson recalled,
``low-level chatter in the newsroom'' and a call from a reader
expressing doubts about a Smith column caused him to review her
1995 work. ``I had alerted Matt (Storin) and (Executive Editor)
Helen (W. Donovan) that I thought there was a problem and I offered
to do further research,'' said Robinson. ``I ultimately went back
to them with a large number of columns from that year that I feared
... contained falsehoods.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he met twice with Smith on the matter and ``told her
about the fruits of the research. She didn't respond.''
</P>
<P>
   When the matter moved into the top editors' offices, it was then
that Barnicle became something of a dilemma for Storin in his
handling of Smith. ``I honestly had to weigh that against the
question of how Barnicle had been handled,'' he said. ``I feel ...
a little bit personally the victim of accusations about Barnicle's
past.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also one nagging item from Smith's past when she was
an editorial assistant at the Chicago Sun-Times. According to Globe
Arts Editor Scott Powers, who was then assistant managing editor
for features at the Sun-Times, errors in a Smith review _ and the
fact that she did not pick up her press tickets _ generated
suspicions that she did not attend an Elton John concert she wrote
about in 1986. According to Powers, Smith insisted she had attended
the concert, decided to use lawn tickets purchased by a friend, and
produced notes from the event. There was never any proof or finding
that she missed the concert. But the Sun-Times published a
correction about song titles and John's attire and Smith was barred
from writing for several months.
</P>
<P>
   Storin, who became editor of the Sun-Times after that incident
and came back to the Globe after Smith was hired here, was aware of
that episode when he was in Chicago. But ``I never really thought
much about it until this stuff first came up'' at the Globe, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Storin _ with the Barnicle question hanging over his head _
spoke to Smith after the 1995 red flags, he voiced concern, but did
not ask her directly whether she had fabricated column material.
After making sure that Smith now knew the ``rules of the road,'' he
issued the same caution to Barnicle and McNamara. Barnicle had no
problems with that, Storin said. And ``with Eileen, there had never
been any question raised, but I felt she had to know what was going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Moore, who began editing Smith's columns in early
1996, the monitoring consisted largely of ``asking for a message or
a note asking who these people were, where they could be found.''
He said that ``the ... presentation of the evidence'' was accepted
on its face as substantiation of accuracy, and no further checking
was done. Managing Editor/News Operations Thomas F. Mulvoy Jr., who
has overseen Barnicle's column for many years, said that under the
new system, Barnicle provided names and phone numbers of people he
cited in his columns roughly a dozen times. ``Then it eased off,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   McNamara is edited by Donovan, who said the columnist would
provide her with background on people mentioned in her column. But
``most of her columns involve a level of reporting and detail that
you would have no reason'' to question them, Donovan said. ``There
have never been any questions raised.'' (Donovan did recall one
minor controversy when McNamara wrote a 1997 column about a
conference in Salem, which included a Salem dateline even though
McNamara hadn't attended the event. Donovan said McNamara had done
sufficient reporting on the conference to avoid any improprieties.)
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while, I asked if this was being done,'' said Storin, of
the monitoring. And at some point, the more intense scrutiny of the
columns ceased. The editor said he read Smith's columns ``with the
assumption she was being careful ... I guess I just had too much
faith in her.''
</P>
<P>
   Storin also said Smith seemed shaken by the ``rules of the
road'' discussion and for a while, ``the quality of her work seemed
to suffer.'' But by 1997, Smith was back in stride. Her work that
year garnered an American Society of Newspapers Editors
Distinguished Writing Award and she was a finalist for a Pulitzer
Prize. (A Globe review has turned up no known problems with Smith's
Pulitzer and ASNE submissions. But all of her columns since 1996
are being reviewed. Storin said that in hindsight, it was wrong to
submit her work for awards.) She had become such a hot commodity
that the Globe gave her a raise to fend off a Philadelphia Inquirer
bid to woo her earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But in mid-May, Robinson ``had a chance encounter with other
members of the staff,'' who were concerned about a May 11 Smith
column in which she wrote about a cancer patient named Claire who
was reacting to news of a treatment that showed promise in mice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It obviously, because of what had happened before, prompted me
to do a quick review of recent columns,'' he said. ``In some of
them, I found a return to the pattern that aroused suspicions
before _ named people with incomplete identifiers saying things
that in some cases seemed more eloquent than one would expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking at about a dozen columns, Robinson ``identified several
that I thought raised the same set of issues,'' and brought them to
the attention of top editors.

FOR AMERICANS, A GAME; FOR IRANIANS, A CAUSE

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYON, France _ Iran's soccer coach carries a green card from the
Great Satan. Jalal Talebi's family has lived in California for
nearly two decades. His youngest son just graduated from Palo Alto
High and is bound for UCLA. His wife has a skin care business and a
vegetarian restaurant near Stanford. Talebi used to coach at a
local junior college. He likes America and Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But all week long, people have been bringing up 1979 to him.
America Held Hostage. Iran, the outlaw state. Revolution, war,
terrorism, embargos, fractured relations between Washington and
Tehran. It all comes back because somebody pulled two balls out of
a bowl last December and matched the US and Iran in a World Cup
soccer match here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't make it too big,'' Talebi pleaded with
journalists last week. ``This is a game. A game of football.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for many of Talebi's countrymen back home, it is much
more. Though the two governments have been edging closer to
normalcy, nudged last week by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, Uncle Sam is still widely regarded with hatred and
mistrust in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   America propped up the Shah for years, opposed the Islamic
revolution, sabotaged the country's economy, and is thought by some
in Iran to have provoked the war with Iraq. Wall murals in Tehran
still say ``Down with the USA'' and show the American flag with
skulls instead of stars.
</P>
<P>
   So an Iranian victory in the Stade Gerland Sunday (it's a night
game here in France) would all but knock the US out of the world's
most important sporting event and be a coup of enormous symbolic
and emotional significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is imperative that we win against the USA,'' says Khodadad
Azizi, the team's star player. ``For historical reasons, our
country is a lot more sensitive to this meeting. Iran has been
disappointed by American politics in recent years. This is the most
important match of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   For the American players, most of whom were young children
during the hostage crisis, Sunday's match has little political
significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't talked about it,'' says playmaker Claudio Reyna,
who was 6 when the US embassy was stormed. ``We've talked about
Iran the soccer team and not Iran the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   US coach Steve Sampson, who was in graduate school in 1979,
remembers the ``America Held Hostage'' drama vividly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can relate to it more than our players,'' he says. ``I
watched it every night on television. Certainly, what happened to
those hostages was devastating to them. Our hearts went out to
them. At some point, though, you have to put those issues aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's match, the first ever between the US and Iran, is being
touted as a bit of political serendipity, bringing two together
countries that have had no diplomatic relations for nearly two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media are calling this the mother of all soccer matches,''
says Talebi. ``They are making it too big, but we accept it. We are
happy to be playing a game that the world is watching.''
</P>
<P>
   After 20 years away from soccer's global stage, the Iranians are
delighted merely to be here. Iran was Asia's dominant team in the
'70s, winning three continental championships and qualifying for
the 1976 Olympics and the 1978 World Cup. Then the revolution and
the Iraq war brought soccer in Iran to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a holy war for us,'' says Talebi, who was national
coach then. ``Our basic thought was to get rid of the enemy and
finish the war. During those eight years, not only soccer but all
of sport fell behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran didn't even try to qualify for the 1982 and 1986 Cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no real game of football in Iran,'' Talebi says.
``So I had to go overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   He became a coaching gypsy, taking jobs in the United Arab
Emirates, in Singapore, in the US.
</P>
<P>
   Talebi settled his family in San Jose, opened a supermarket and
took a coaching job at De Anza community college. While the Islamic
government back home railed against the Great Satan, Talebi felt
welcome as an Iranian in the States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was treated as everyone else,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Talebi still carried an Iranian passport, still went home for
several months every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born in Iran,'' he says. ``Iran is my country. Everyone
loves their country and wants to die for their country.''
</P>
<P>
   For Talebi, the serendipity is not that his country is playing
America but that his country is playing in the Cup at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranians are here by a near-miracle. They did not win their
qualifying group last year. They could not beat Japan in the Asian
playoff. They could not beat Australia at home in the first match
of their last-chance playoff and trailed, 2-0, with 14 minutes left
in the return match at Melbourne. Somehow, the Iranians pulled off
a draw and got a ticket to France because they had scored more road
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 20 years, we are here,'' says Talebi, who was brought in
last month to coach after the squad lost by six goals to Rome's
club team. ``This is a victory for us. We are here to get more
experience, to show everyone we can play, that we are one of the
best countries in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing Uncle Sam, though, adds undeniable spice to the quest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can hardly imagine what's going to happen in Tehran if we
win,'' says Mohammad Khakpour, the squad's top defender.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens inside the Stade Gerland Sunday, the Iranians
plan to shake hands with the Americans after the final whistle and
exchange jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no problems with the American people,'' says Ali Daei,
their star forward. ``The people are not the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the international noise over the match hasn't reached
the players. The Iranian team has been secluded in a bakery school
in Yssingeaux, a 90-minute drive southwest of the city. The
American team is quartered in an ivy-covered chateau in the wine
country an hour's drive north.
</P>
<P>
   The players know each other by reputation and by jersey number.
They're vaguely aware of the recent diplomatic dance steps between
their governments. But for most of them, what happened in 1979 is
hazy history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Great Satan? What's that?'' US midfielder/-surfer Frankie
Hejduk wondered last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a board wax,'' he was told.

U.S.-Iran: Ultimate in political football
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BORDEAUX, France _ The lingering image is of American citizens
being put on display on the streets of Teheran, handcuffed and
blindfolded, the American flag burning at their feet and chants of
``Death to Satan'' ringing through their ears.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20 years later, 22 men from the United States and Iran will
march onto a small patch of grass in France, many of them hardly
able to remember the details of the 1979 international crisis.
</P>
<P>
   They pledge to try and offer the world another image.
</P>
<P>
   They will arrive to an entirely different corner of the world, a
snug little French city called Lyon, which is known for tempting
wines and quaint sidewalk cafes.
</P>
<P>
   Their flags will be waving above plazas, parks and the charming
35,000-seat Stade Gerland. Their fans will be wearing only their
colors.
</P>
<P>
   They will be bound only by their nation's political pasts and
the ramifications tied to this day for more than six months.
</P>
<P>
   And the only thing at their feet will be a soccer ball, which
they all know is in the same shape as the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sportsmen, not politicians,'' said Iranian coach Jalel
Talebi, who in an ironic twist in this soccer showdown is a coach
who has lived in Southern California the past 17 years. ``We want
to play football and show everybody that we have no problem with
the American people. But there are political things involved, I
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Players and coaches from both sides have known the factors
involved in today's game for months. Only recently has the game
become even more pertinent in a World Cup sense _ both teams need a
victory to keep hopes alive for advancing in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize both governments are looking at this game and would
like to get one over on each other,'' U.S. goalkeeper Kasey Keller
said. ``If they beat us, they've had a successful World Cup. I
expect the first 10 or 15 minutes will be an emotional situation
for everybody. I wish all the attention we're getting would be just
about soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not.
</P>
<P>
   For 90 minutes today in Lyon, the world will watch the United
States and Iran battle on a soccer field not just because of things
like the Group F standings, the opportunity of earning points in
the round-robin and putting on a display of terrific soccer.
</P>
<P>
   The world surely will watch as much because of what was put on
display nearly 20 years ago in Tehran, the 444 terroristic days,
the tense history and lingering ill feelings by people of both
nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can relate to that period of time a lot better than the
players can,'' U.S. coach Steve Sampson said. ``I was glued to the
television every night watching the news.''
</P>
<P>
   Said U.S. defender Alexi Lalas, 28: ``What I remember is, U.S.
good; Iran bad. Of course, the fact that we are playing together
will be symbolic. It makes for a good picture. But whether you can
change deep-rooted feelings between the governments is a different
question.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the painful and bitter feelings between the nations
hardly have tempered over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic relations between the nations remain severed and it
was not until last week, perhaps in an effort to ease pressures for
today's game, that U.S. government officials even hinted at
relaxing its strong stance against Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Both President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
addressed the U.S.-Iran game last week, using the opportunity to
mention the possible resumption of diplomatic relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also reportedly taped a special message that
will be broadcast during today's game.
</P>
<P>
   Still, last month the U.S. State Department called Iran the
world's most active sponsor of terrorism and the Iranian government
has made no secret of its involvement in the game. National
officials will be present in the stadium today and all business
activity is expected to be suspended in Iran during the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian government also condemned a French television
station's showing of the movie Not Without My Daughter, which it
said depicts Iranians in a negative light. The government even
briefly hinted at pulling its team from the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian players realize the stakes involved today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to win'' Iranian forward Khodadad Azizi said. ``For
historical reasons, our country is a lot more sensitive to this
meeting. Iran has been disappointed by American politics in recent
years. We have to win. This is the most important match of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The game has received such attention that the international
soccer federation has banned fans from bringing banners or signs
into the stadium. It also has increased security for the game and
admitted that it has received threats of ``unknown'' factions
saying they would disrupt the game.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team has made public their hotel headquarters while in
Lyon.
</P>
<P>
   And FIFA president Sepp Blatter has admitted that it was ``no
accident'' that chosen to call the game was a referee from
Switzerland, a noted neutral nation with good relations with the
United States and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the middle of it all are the players and coaches,
the majority of whom have announced that they will try to spurn
FIFA's World Cup edict of immediately leaving the field in favor of
an age-old soccer tradition _ trading jerseys at the final whistle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Win or lose, I am going to try and trade jerseys,'' U.S.
forward Eric Wynalda said. ``Before the game we are going to shake
hands and at the end I would like to trade jerseys. It's a great
example of how the World Cup and soccer brings nations together.''
</P>
<P>
   Said U.S. midfielder Ernie Stewart: ``It could be a great symbol
to both nations of how things can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course. But today the world will watch these nations play
soccer because of the way things were from 1979-1981 and what it
has done to these political nemeses since.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to keep the politics out of it completely,''
Sampson said. ``But it is hard to ignore history.''

FIXES YEAR OF OLAZABAL'S RETURN 
SHORT HOLE STYMIES BROOKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Fort Worth resident Mark Brooks watched his
chance to move into contention during the third round disappear
with a triple bogey at the 288-yard seventh hole, the shortest
par-4 at the Olympic Club.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks pulled his drive into a bush, forcing him to take an
unplayable lie. His recovery shot kicked into the rough and Brooks
eventually three-putted for a seven. After playing the first six
holes at even par, Brooks was 6 over on the final 12, dropping to
12 over for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played the short holes poorly. That really hurt,'' said
Brooks, who also took one of only five bogeys recorded at No. 1, a
533-yard par-5 that played to a tournament-low scoring average of
4.58. Another bogey came at No. 10, a 422-yard par-4.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' third-round highlight proved to be an 18-foot chip-in
for birdie from the rough surrounding the 13th green.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a tough week,'' said Brooks, who survived the cut at
his first major championship since winning the 1996 PGA. ``I didn't
have a lot of confidence coming in. But even if you did, you were
still going to have problems here.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks agreed with fellow pros who have criticized the U.S. Golf
Association's course set-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``About every third year, they miss the boat in trying to make
the winner shoot around par,'' Brooks said. ``If you're in the
rough, more than half the lies here are total luck around the
greens. There's not much skill involved. You just make a slash and
go at it.''
Nicklaus, Woods fade Jack Nicklaus, who survived the cut in his
42nd Open with a 40-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole of Friday's
round, ran out of magic yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I visualized a 65. That was in my mind until I passed it on
the 17th fairway,'' said Nicklaus, who shot a 73 and dropped to 10
over.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, meanwhile, opened with a birdie and did not take
another in his final 17 holes. He registered consecutive bogeys at
Nos. 3 and 4, then parred in to shoot 71 and drop to 7 over.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those weeks where I can't keep anything
going,'' Woods said. ``Everything will go perfect for four holes,
then my swing goes away. Or I'll make everything for a few holes
and then I'll four-putt.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who did not three-putt during his victory at the 1997
Masters, has two four-putts and three three-putts on his card at
the 1998 Open.
Rolling with Casey Perhaps appropriately, disabled golfer Casey
Martin played the third round with the only player in the field who
might have an inkling of what his physical condition would be like:
Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal.
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal's career was presumed over in 1996, when he was unable
to walk 18 holes without severe pain because of what was initially
diagnosed as severe arthritis. Eventually, Olazabal's condition
improved and he returned to the European Tour in 1997 after an
18-month absence.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who suffers from a rare circulatory disorder that makes
it difficult for him to walk, was granted a federal court order in
February allowing him to use a cart in competition at professional
events.
</P>
<P>
   Before the round, Olazabal joked with Martin about letting him
ride in the passenger's seat. Although he said he ``feels
sympathy'' for Martin, Olazabal made it clear that he disagrees
with the U.S. court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a chance to play and was told that I would be able to
use a buggy,'' Olazabal said. ``I declined the invitation. I think
that walking is part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin termed the pairing ``ironic'' and said the two exchanged
nothing but pleasantries throughout 18 holes that ended with
Olazabal shooting 71 and Martin fashioning a 74.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew about his foot problems, so I thought it was ironic
that we played together,'' Martin said. ``But we're in totally
different situations. He's almost 100 percent and I never will
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Told about Olazabal's anti-cart stance, Martin shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't seem bitter at all,'' Martin said. ``He was very
congenial.''
Briefly After omitting the driver from his bag in the first two
rounds, John Daly unleashed it yesterday on six holes. He hit a
390-yard drive on No. 6, setting up a birdie, and drove the green
at the 288-yard seventh hole. Off the seventh tee, Daly used a
3-wood.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Perry recorded the first hole-in-one of the tournament by
knocking a 6-iron into the cup at the 176-yard 13th hole. It marked
his third career ace in tournament competition but his first at the
Open.

<TEXT>
<P>
   On occasion, the Rev. Jack Spaulding of St. Thomas the Apostle
Church in Phoenix has delivered messages during prayer services in
a monotone voice, in the first person, as if Jesus or Mary were
speaking directly through him.
</P>
<P>
   A parishioner from St. Thomas mentioned this to me recently,
adding, ``I wonder if it was the Lord who told Father Jack to throw
the nuns out of their convent.''
</P>
<P>
   I confess, I didn't ask him. A man can't escape a boyhood spent
in parochial school, where he leaned _ the hard way _ not to be
flip with priests or nuns.
</P>
<P>
   He also learned, however, that people make a church, not build
ings. And the nuns at St. Thomas are being forced out of their
convent for no good, and certainly no holy reason.
</P>
<P>
   The church sits like a birthday cake at 24th Street and
Campbell, a monument to spiritual chic since Charlie Keating poured
$50,000 into the place to spruce it up for a family wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Benedictine sisters began teach ing at the parish school 45
years ago. That's why the convent was built. Over the years, the
church and the school changed. There's only one Benedictine
teaching in the school, now. The convent houses 12 nuns, four of
them Benedictines and the rest from other orders. &QL; 
`CHOSE CONVENT LIFE' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the sisters told me, ``We came together because we all
chose to live the convent life. We were from different religious
orders but of like minds.''
</P>
<P>
   The sisters range in age from the 40s to the mid-80s.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ella Mae Bleier, a member of the parish council,
the growing church needs room to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Plans originally had called for temporary buildings to be
installed for use next year by the school. In May, however, Father
Spaulding informed the nuns of a new idea. A house was available
for sale across the street and it was big enough, he said, to
accommodate the four Benedictine sisters. The convent would then be
converted to church use.
</P>
<P>
   Since the other nuns aren't part of the order that first taught
at the school, parish officials say they have no obligation to
accommodate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If sisters decide to live outside their particular religious
commu nity,'' Spaulding said, ``it really isn't the individual
parish's responsi bility to provide them a hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the pastor promised to help the other sisters. In the
meantime, the Benedictines decided not to live in the new house.
They also said no to having an upstairs portion of the parish
offices renovated specially for them. They did so partly because
the facilities didn't meet their needs and partly as a show of
solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, all 12 nuns are leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me so sad,'' a parish ioner told me. ``The sisters
are more valuable than whatever we use their convent for.'' &QL; 
NO POLICY ON TIME &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In some Catholic dioceses, nuns being displaced are given a year
to make arrangements. Phoenix doesn't have such a policy, although
I'm told one is now being considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there had been such a policy (here) we certainly would have
followed it,'' Spaulding told me. ``We did, however, give the
sisters three months.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months. Six months. A year. It doesn't matter. A nun told
me, years ago, that we should only discard our bad habits. We don't
need another denomination that chooses economical over ecumeni cal.
We already have houses of worship called General Motors, Mi crosoft
and AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   None of the sisters would say anything critical to me about
Spaulding.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wouldn't be proper,'' I was told.
</P>
<P>
   Ella Mae Bleier said the parish did all it could for the nuns.
There are no bad guys in this conflict, she told me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's change,'' she said. ``This is what a lot of people can't
accept.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But, if the Lord really does speak through Father
Spauld ing, I hope He takes a moment soon to retell a story I first
heard from a nun. It's about a nice young couple and their baby
boy.
</P>
<P>
   And how there was no room for them at the inn. &QL;

THRIVING JOCKEY EVENT SPARKS NEW IDEAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ By almost every yardstick, Friday night's
NTRA All-Star Jockey Championship was again a rousing success.
</P>
<P>
   But Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie and officials of the
National Thoroughbred Racing Association are already trying to
determine how the product can be improved next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We even had a briefing session with all the jockeys and the
(Jockey's) Guild executives, and kicked around a few ideas there,''
said track general manager Corey Johnsen, who came up with the idea
for the popular event. ``I can see some exciting additions to next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Shane Sellers won three of the four All-Star races en route to a
runaway victory against 11 other top jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers kept his momentum going yesterday, too, riding Colcon to
a perfectly timed come-from-behind victory in the Locust Grove
Handicap at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., a $150,000 race.
</P>
<P>
   The attendance of 16,156 for the All-Star competition was almost
1,000 more than last year, and betting was up, too. Lone Star fans
wagered nearly $700,000 just on the four All-Star races, and
out-of-town simulcast sites pumped in an extra $1.89 million.
</P>
<P>
   The new All-Star Wager grossed only $109,000 in betting
nationwide, almost half of that at Lone Star, but the generous
payoffs almost guarantee it receives more attention next year. The
predictable $2 trifecta of Sellers, Julie Krone and Jerry Bailey
paid $670.60.
</P>
<P>
   Even more importantly for the participants, more than $140,000
was raised Friday for the Jockey's Guild's disabled riders fund.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Johnsen says the local events surrounding the
All-Star evening could be bolstered, perhaps with a golf tournament
or an expanded luncheon. And someday, he said, a foreign jockey
such as Frankie Dettori or Texas native Cash Asmussen could be
invited to participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can really break through in year three,'' Johnsen said.
NTRA president ``Tim Smith's comment that this needs to be racing's
All-Star break was very perceptive.
</P>
<P>
   ``In horse racing, the attention during the first part of the
year is obviously on the Triple Crown. After that, we take a little
break and the attention turns to older horses in the Breeders' Cup.
That makes (the All-Star Jockey Championship) the perfect kind of
midseason event.'' &QL; 
MASTERY'S GAMBLE STAYS IN CHARGE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was like an instant replay, only a little longer.
</P>
<P>
   Mastery's Gamble, who three weeks ago at Lone Star breezed to a
6 3/4-length front-running victory at seven furlongs in the Two
Altazano Stakes, showed her heels to Texas-bred females again
yesterday going a mile.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old mare set an easy pace, turned back a challenge by
rival Two Steppin' Toni entering the stretch, and opened up to win
the $50,000 Texas Legends Stakes by 3 1/4 lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Two Steppin' Toni finished second, another 1 3/4 lengths ahead
of third-place Coronado Katy.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunate Smile, the Texas-bred ship-in from Massachusetts who
went to post at the same 3-to-2 odds as Mastery's Gamble, faltered
in the 100-degree heat and finished last in the five-horse field. &QL; 
SHOWDOWN IN DOUBT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Next Sunday's Hollywood Gold Cup has suddenly gone from an
excellent race to a potential blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away and Gentlemen _ perhaps the two best older horses in
training _ were already being pointed for the $1 million race at
Hollywood Park in Inglewood, Calif. And on Friday, trainer Bob
Baffert announced that Silver Charm will probably also run.
</P>
<P>
   But as is usually the case in horse racing, there are no sure
things.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day Baffert revealed his decision, Skip Away threw
his exercise rider at Belmont Park and ran loose for 20 minutes.
Yesterday his front legs were slightly swollen, although he was not
lame or sore, trainer Sonny Hine said.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Hine has been savoring a meeting with Silver Charm.
Now he doesn't know what will happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've postponed his workout from Monday to Tuesday, and if he
makes the work on Tuesday, we'll be there,'' Hine said. ``We're not
out of it, but we're sure having a little problem right now. Maybe
it will all work out yet.''

1 PRIEST KICKING 12 HABITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On occasion, the Rev. Jack Spaulding of St. Thomas the Apostle
Church in Phoenix has delivered messages during prayer services in
a monotone voice, in the first person, as if Jesus or Mary were
speaking directly through him.
</P>
<P>
   A parishioner from St. Thomas mentioned this to me recently,
adding, ``I wonder if it was the Lord who told Father Jack to throw
the nuns out of their convent.''
</P>
<P>
   I confess, I didn't ask him. A man can't escape a boyhood spent
in parochial school, where he leaned _ the hard way _ not to be
flip with priests or nuns.
</P>
<P>
   He also learned, however, that people make a church, not build
ings. And the nuns at St. Thomas are being forced out of their
convent for no good, and certainly no holy reason.
</P>
<P>
   The church sits like a birthday cake at 24th Street and
Campbell, a monument to spiritual chic since Charlie Keating poured
$50,000 into the place to spruce it up for a family wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Benedictine sisters began teach ing at the parish school 45
years ago. That's why the convent was built. Over the years, the
church and the school changed. There's only one Benedictine
teaching in the school, now. The convent houses 12 nuns, four of
them Benedictines and the rest from other orders. &QL; 
`CHOSE CONVENT LIFE' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the sisters told me, ``We came together because we all
chose to live the convent life. We were from different religious
orders but of like minds.''
</P>
<P>
   The sisters range in age from the 40s to the mid-80s.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ella Mae Bleier, a member of the parish council,
the growing church needs room to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Plans originally had called for temporary buildings to be
installed for use next year by the school. In May, however, Father

</P>
<P>
   Still, the pastor promised to help the other sisters. In the
meantime, the Benedictines decided not to live in the new house.
They also said no to having an upstairs portion of the parish

the facilities didn't meet their needs and partly as a show of

 &HT;    Smoltz sharp as Braves win 5-1
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ John Smoltz's return to action went perfectly and
precisely to the pitch Saturday night. Working seven strong and
pain-free innings, Smoltz gave up just an unearned run and struck
out a season-high eight as the Braves beat Montreal 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   In his first start since lasting just two innings May 23 and
then going on the disabled list for the second time this season,
Smoltz displayed no pain in his pitching elbow and little for the
Expos to hit. He was much sharper than in his two minor-league
rehab assignments and got a first-inning, three-run homer from Javy
Lopez. Working on a 90-pitch limit, Smoltz (5-1) left after giving
up just four hits and registering his last strikeout on his 90th
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of his return, Smoltz didn't quite know what to
expect. ``The question is, do I have the total package?'' he
wondered. ``I don't know. But it sure would be nice to have a big
lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez quickly complied. After Walt Weiss led off the night with
the first of his three straight singles and Chipper Jones singled
Weiss to second, both players advanced when Carlos Perez stumbled
in his delivery, fell off the mound and dropped the ball for a
balk. On the next pitch, Lopez crushed a two-out, three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   It was Lopez's 16th home run, a figure he didn't reach last
season until July 26th. It was also his fourth homer against the
Expos, third in eight days. And it gave him 52 RBIs, just 17 shy of
his career season high.
</P>
<P>
   It also gave Smoltz an early three-run security blanket. Not
that he needed it. After the second Expo batter, Jose Vidro, lined
an opposite-field double on a good down-and-away breaking ball,
Smoltz retired the next 11 hitters. At one point, he struck out six
of eight, fanning the side swinging in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   When Montreal finally broke through in the fifth, it was an
unearned run. After Chipper Jones' booted Rondell White's leadoff
grounder for a two-base error, White took third on a flyout, then
scored on Chris Widger's sacrifice fly. But that merely cut it to
5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams, again capitalizing on another rare start,
followed Weiss' leadoff single in the fifth with the second of his
three singles. Chipper Jones, scratched from Friday's embarrassing
14-1 loss with the flu, then doubled both Braves home.

 &HT;    Still aiming high: Shank's aim still steady after injury
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- A quarter thrown into the crowd at a high school
football game struck Luke Shank's right eye like a BB hitting
glass, shattering the lens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a thunk, and I'm on the ground,'' Shank said.
</P>
<P>
   How does Shank know it was a quarter if he never saw it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because my friend has it,'' the 18-year-old from Fort Wayne,
Ind., said with a smile. ``My dad was going to put it in the stock
of my rifle. ... Maybe my new rifle.''
</P>
<P>
   His new left-handed rifle. A shooter depends on his eye the way
a kicker does his leg. But the freak accident forced Shank to
switch the eye he uses to sight the target and, by extension, shoot
from the left side of his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just awkward; it's not harder,'' said Shank, who will
compete Monday and Tuesday in air rifle at the USA Shooting
National Championships at Wolf Creek Olympic Shooting Complex.
``It's ingrained in your head one way, and you have to turn it
around.''
</P>
<P>
   After a 10-month layoff, Shank returned to the sport a year ago
and placed fourth at the Junior Olympics three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   His cousin, JP O'Connor of Marietta, helps coach him, often by
phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He spent an awful lot of time standing at home, holding the
gun and pointing at a pencil dot on the wall,'' O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as he had to switch from right to left, Shank also
transferred his longtime wish of attending West Point to the
reality of entering the Naval Academy, which recruited him for its
rifle team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coach caught wind of his story,'' O'Connor, 43, said. ``I
look at him and think, `Why couldn't I be like that when I was 18?'
He's got the drive, the ambition and the brains.''
</P>
<P>
   For three months after the accident, Shank couldn't see at all.
He spent the first two weeks on the couch deep in thought, but not
self-pity, even though he knew if he'd worn his glasses and not his
contacts, he would've been fine.
</P>
<P>
   Things had been going so well, Shank told himself. ``I was
making good grades, had the highest rank in ROTC and was shooting
well,'' he said. ``I got self-confident, and then it humbles you
and makes you appreciate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shank never doubted he'd be able to see again. Looking at his
brown eyes, there's no way for an outsider to tell which one has
the implanted lens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of led to believe, because I think people wanted to
cheer me up, that I'd be able to see all right again,'' Shank said,
``so I was kind of waiting on that. The doctor essentially told me
I'd never see better than 20-60. He's still amazed that I can see.
Beyond 10 feet on a normal eye chart, I can read the 20-20 line
with corrected vision.''
</P>
<P>
   The glasses he wears have ``bulletproof'' lenses, he said, which
protect his good eye with 20-15 vision, as well as the one, he
said, ``that's like it's 70 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Shank, who got his first gun at age 6 and shot at GI Joes, golf
balls and pop cans, will report to Annapolis next month with a
medical waiver. He jokes that he won't be a fighter pilot, but
that's OK, because he's more interested in engineering and physics.
</P>
<P>
   Shank has worked long hours with O'Connor this week to make up
for a month spent getting into shape for the academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be physically training and shooting,'' Shank said.
``If you build coarse muscle, it causes jitters.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to score 590 out of 600 during the 1 hour and 45
minutes he has to record 60 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole reason someone shoots is it's virtually impossible
to shoot perfect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he won't stop trying.

 &HT;    Nicklaus has right attitude
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- Leave it to Jack Nicklaus to put the U.S. Open
in perspective, while all about him there is much wailing, groaning
and gnashing of teeth. A pro from Ashtabula, who also owns cart
rights and runs weekend dog fights, snarls about the narrow
fairways. A reformed alcoholic, and assorted other tour types,
complain about pin placements.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can bet our members wouldn't stand for this kind of stuff
at Virgin Valley Bar &AMP; Country Club,'' says the assistant pro from
Vallejo.
</P>
<P>
   One pro from Ohio said, ``You make the cut and you say, 'I've
got to go through two more days of this?' This course doesn't turn
men into boys, it turns men into children.'' Blimey, child, then
catch the next plane home.
</P>
<P>
   What Jack Nicklaus, winner of four Opens and an ardent defender
of the game, said was this: ``Power is part of golf, but precision
is a far greater part of the game. The U.S. Open, to me, is the
complete examination. Power and accuracy combined with touch is
what this game is all about, keeping the ball in play and playing
with discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus had just come in Friday from sinking a putt from here
to Rhode Island, on the 18th green, damned and cursed by a chorus
of bellyachers, that kept him in town two more days. He'd made the
cut in the U.S. Open at The Olympic Club, playing with an honorary
exemption, assailed by Frank Hannigan, who left the USGA for TV, as
out of order. In this field of all the best, playing for the
championship of the nation, on a course that would bring a Marine
to his knees, the Old Man was going the distance.
</P>
<P>
   What this did was send him out Saturday morning with a large
body, 230 pounds of vagabond pro from Illinois named Tom Sipula, a
qualifier who plays the Canadian Tour without distinction. Sipula
said he wasn't awed by the pairing, but he started out bogey,
bogey, double bogey and never recovered. Nicklaus beat him by
three. Nicklaus had squeaked in under the wire at 147. A pro from
Oklahoma, Rocky Walcher, had made a par putt on the treacherous
18th green for the same number, and that lopped off 15 other
players, including Tom Watson, Corey Pavin and Hale Irwin, all at
148. An even 60 players made the cut, the USGA standard.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Tom Lehman story was developing again. It's
becoming like a serial. Three years in a row he has played the
third round at Shinnecock, Oakland Hills and Congressional in the
60s, and here he was in with another. When the last Open was played
at Olympic, Lehman was working in a pro shop. ``I wasn't even
playing golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a winner of the British Open, he has been knocking on the
door of this championship for four years, but nobody answered. He
began this round as hot as a Savannah summer. Chipped to three feet
on the first hole, to three feet on the second, and put his tee
shot 10 feet from the pin on the third. He missed the next three
fairways. Three birdies followed by three bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   After three finishes of third, second and third, does he feel
the Open owes him one? ``It doesn't owe me one. I owe myself,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually during the Pacific afternoon, red figures dropped from
the leaderboard. Matt Kuchar, the kid with the fetching smile,
disappeared completely in the jaws of a 76. Lehman and Bob Tway,
who formed his game at Atlanta Country Club, were left to chase
Payne Stewart, who has now been out front at each sundown.
</P>
<P>
   My guess, it's a Lehman Open.

 &HT;    Father's day at the open
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's a story that Boys' Life would not publish.
It's fiction so far-fetched, you'd send the Hardy Boys into
gut-breaking laughter. Surely, the schmaltz police would surround
you.
</P>
<P>
   OK, just for laughs, can you run that by me again? You say the
kid, a gangly golfer who grins more than a guilty politician, turns
20 on Father's Day while he's playing in a U.S. Open as an amateur
and beating many of the world's best players? Are you serious?
</P>
<P>
   Granted, he's the U.S. Amateur champion from Georgia Tech and
arguably the best college player in the nation, but what's that? A
final round on Father's Day, with his father, Peter, on his bag?
</P>
<P>
   Well, as Matt Kuchar's smiling mug will attest, it's not only
``way cool,'' it's way true. Just when it seemed as though Kuchar's
1998 highlight footage could not upstage finishing 21st at the
Masters winning over every mother in the nation and earning a
return trip to Augusta, here he was Saturday only two shots off the
lead in the 98th U.S. Open before sliding to a 6-over 76 finish,
and falling eight strokes behind leader Payne Stewart with an
overall 5-over 215. Kuchar made the early surge displaying all the
nervousness of somebody hitting range balls at Druid Hills.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, Kuchar had been following double-bogeys with birdies,
and staying cooler than the ocean breeze. As a matter of fact,
after playing two days with Kuchar, defending champion Ernie Els
was ready to say the kid would be right there today, with a
mind-boggling reason to remember a 20th birthday and Father's Day,
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he's playing, the way he's controlling his emotions,''
said Els, ``he's got a real good chance. I said to him, `After this
week, you might want to turn pro. You might have a 10-year
exemption.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday if he seriously can contend, Kuchar said quickly,
``I don't think so.'' At the time it was midafternoon and he
trailed Payne Stewart by five shots. As the day wore on, however,
and The Olympic Club found some victims because of a putt-putt pin
placement on the 18th, Stewart regressed. Kuchar went to bed a mere
two shots off the lead.
</P>
<P>
   More nervous than his demeanor would imply _ he starts his grin
nearly before the ball has found the cup _ Kuchar said, ``There is
the experience factor. We'll see how I handle the final two days
here, see how well I stack up against these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that Kuchar proudly defends his father. Peter,
the insurance and investment man from Lake Mary, Fla., is living
every dad's dream, having caddied for his son during an Amateur
victory and now in two majors. While Kuchar obviously draws
inspiration and finds a calm from his presence, it's Dad who gets
so demonstrative by cheering, jumping and college-type high-fives
that he occasionally disturbs fellow caddies and players.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Riefke, who caddies for Justin Leonard and has spent two
days watching the act, spoke with Peter earlier in the week about
``being more aware of his surroundings.'' On the 12th green Friday,
Riefke said he fixed a heel print that was a result of Father
Kuchar's jumping around after Matt's birdie. At the 18th green
Friday, Leonard, already irked with his own game, motioned Peter to
move out of his peripheral vision while lining up a putt. When the
ESPN cameras caught Leonard, he was shaking his head, obviously
perturbed.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Peter upset him, Leonard said, ``Next question.''
Then he added, ``It does me no good to answer that question,
understand?''
</P>
<P>
   Els admitted, ``His father gets quite excited. Matt's very calm,
but his father's the other side of the coin.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking toward a car shuttle to the media center Friday, Matt
said, ``I think any dad would react the same way in the same
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked flatly whether his father is a distraction, Kuchar even
smiled then.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I think Dad does a good job _ very good golf etiquette,''
Matt said. ``He gets excited after I make a putt or hit a shot, but
the players have time to calm down themselves and let the crowd
subside. ... He's great for me. I don't know if it would be an
advantage for another guy to have my dad, but he keeps me calm. He
keeps me relaxed. Seeing him excited is just a lot of fun for of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   That a son doesn't care to rob his father of a lifetime thrill,
regardless that he gets carried away, only adds to the son's
character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hitting every shot with him,'' said Peter, a 6-handicap
player. ``Trust me. Every shot. The kid's got a flair for the
dramatic. He never ceases to amaze me.''
</P>
<P>
   Fun is the optimum word for both Matt and his Dad. It is costing
Peter about $30,000 to play around the world this summer _ they are
in Scotland for the Loch Lomond Invitational in two weeks, followed
by the British Open in England _ but surely it will return to the
family kitty in the near future. How near is the real question. For
the first time, Matt is waffling a bit when asked about the pro
issue. College is fun, yes, and he has two years remaining. But a
lot has happened lately. It's obvious he can play with these guys,
or outplay them. He began the third round seven shots ahead of
Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if money can persuade me to leave,'' Kuchar said.
``I haven't even thought about it. I'm not sure what will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he dare think about, gasp, winning a U.S. Open as a
20-year-old amateur?
</P>
<P>
   No way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember in junior tournaments, I was always thinking, `What
am I going to say in my acceptance speech?' '' Kuchar said. ``I
would be playing in the last group on the last day and I'm
thinking, `What am I going to say when I get the trophy?' ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I never won a single junior event.''

 &HT;    Montgomerie hears it from fans
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Colin Montgomerie is about to complete another
forgettable U.S. Open, a Saturday 77 having placed him at
11-over-par 221. And that's the less troublesome part.
</P>
<P>
   After being showered by jeers and catcalls from Olympic Club
fans Friday, Montgomerie was given extra security for Saturday's
third round. The United States Golf Association put a security
force around the Scotsman that included two San Francisco policemen
and a Daly County cop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's regrettable,'' David Fay, the USGA executive director,
told European reporters. ``We're just hoping verbal abuse doesn't
turn into physical abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Favorites fizzle big-time
</P>
<P>
   So much for the U.S. Open pre-tournament favorites. Tom Watson
missed the cut. Justin Leonard faded further out of view Saturday
with a 77. Jim Furyk finally awoke Saturday with 68 and is at five
over. PGA Tour leading moneywinner Fred Couples ballooned to 18
over with a 79.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play very well the first two days and I got behind
the 8-ball,'' said Furyk, who lost a playoff to J.P. Hayes at
Westchester a week ago. ``I still think par or just under par will
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, not really a favorite but a man familiar with
Olympic from his college days, kept saying all week that he was
playing well, but hasn't showed it. He's at 7-over 217 following a
71 Saturday that included 14 straight pars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made many putts,'' Woods said. ``I haven't hit the
ball solidly. I haven't hit the ball below the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Distance, however, typically has not been a problem. Woods hit
driver, wedge (148) yards on the 533-yard, par-5 first hole and
two-putted for birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Woods and Jack Nicklaus were among those players complaining
about sand-filled divots causing soggy lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfair,'' Woods said. ``It's one thing to be in the
middle of the fairway. It's another thing to end up in a bunker in
the middle of the fairway.:''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus called the 18th fairway a ``mine field.'' Said the
58-year-old, four-time champion, who shot a 73 and is at 10 over,
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know if you have a chip or a bunker shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry aces 13th hole
</P>
<P>
   Chris Perry made a hole-in-one on the par-3, 13th hole with a
6-iron from 176 yards, during a 2-over 72, moving to seven over for
the tournament. His respect for the course did not diminish,
though. ``This course doesn't turn men into boys; it turns men into
children,'' said Perry. ``It makes us pros, who are the best in the
game _ the top 1 percent of people who play golf _ look like
15-handicappers.'' ... What does Matt Kuchar, the Georgia Tech
phenom, say when he's angry at a shot on the course? ``Cornbread!''
... Kuchar's ball says ``Kooch'' on it. Lee Janzen's carries the
number 93, denoting his 1993 Open win. ... The 60 players to make
the cut was the lowest since 1977, when 60 also advanced to the
weekend.

COMPUTER GAME'S PHANTOM MILLION-DOLLAR WINNER LEAVES PLAYERS
SKEPTICAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The death of Professor Jonathon William Faulkner was accompanied
by a curious inheritance left to his students: $1 million for the
one who could solve a mystery hidden in his 10-room mansion.
</P>
<P>
   With that fictional premise, a Scottsdale company lured
thousands of computer sleuths into buying a $50 game _ and
competing in an arduous contest that promised $1 million to the
real-life winner.
</P>
<P>
   But, two years later, Sirius Publishing Inc. has transformed its
software conundrum into a mystery by refusing to fully identify the
winner.
</P>
<P>
   The twist has sent angry players of the Treasure Quest software
game on a new mission _ trying to find out whether the
award-winning games is as bogus as Professor Faulkner's will.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut feeling is that it's a scam,'' said Paul Wigowsky, an
Oregon schoolteacher who this week filed a consumer fraud complaint
with the Arizona Attorney General's Office. ``Unless we see the
winner with our own eyes, we won't believe it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Karie Dozer, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Grant Woods,
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Sirius President Richard Gnant insisted that the Treasure
Quest winner is a real person, the prize money will be paid as
advertised and that game rules were followed ``impeccably.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're miffed because they didn't win,'' Gnant said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've maintained the integrity of this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Treasure Quest began April 10, 1996, with a flurry of fanfare as
the world's first million-dollar software contest and, Gnant said,
sold 225,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   The game is based on the mystery left behind by Professor
Faulkner, as revealed in a series of computer screens. Players face
a labyrinth of about 1,200 clues involving word and number riddles
tapping everything from ancient Hebrew letters to Morse code to
literary quotations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to solving the puzzle, winners were required to
submit an essay of at least 1,000 words explaining their answer.
</P>
<P>
   Wigowsky and others said they spent thousands of hours
deciphering codes, doing library research and trading ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when the winner was announced May 17, there was no press
release, photo session or celebration _ just a note on the Treasure
Quest Web site identifying the $1 million answer as ``The Tree of
Life.''
</P>
<P>
   That revelation came with a cryptic identification of the
winner: ``P. Dreizen of San Francisco, California.''
</P>
<P>
   Telephone operators list only one Dreizen in San Francisco _
Pamela. She did not respond to a phone message, and computer
searches under that name lead nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Gnant said P. Dreizen asked not to be identified further. He
added that game rules don't require the winner to go public, and he
is morally bound to respect Dreizen's request.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Treasure Quest rules specifically waive a player's right to
privacy: ``Entry constitutes permission (except where prohibitted)
to use winner's name, likeness, hometown, biographical information
and any comments about the contest for publicity purposes without
compensation.''
</P>
<P>
   Gnant said he didn't release the winning essay because Dreizen
asked him not to, and because it contains personal information.
</P>
<P>
   He said the essay was required only as a tie-breaker, in case
two winning entries were submitted the same day. &QL; 
WEB SITE CLOSED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the winner was announced, Gnant closed the
Treasure Quest Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was so much untruth in there,'' he said, referring to
postings from disgruntled players. ``I watched these people trash
my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gnant refused to answer basic questions such as: How many
people were on the winning team? Is Dreizen male or female? When
was the winning entry submitted?
</P>
<P>
   That date is critical to players who say they came up with the
mystery answer more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Gnant acknowledged that Wigowsky solved the riddle
before Dreizen, but was disqualified because he did not place a
contest registration number in the appropriate place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy didn't follow the rules, so he didn't win Treasure
Quest. I'm sorry,'' Gnant added. ``Maybe I should have told him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gnant, the brother of state Rep. Randall Gnant, R-Scottsdale,
blamed the controversy on ``extremists'' and said most contestants
loved the game. He stressed that judging was verified by a renowned
New York company that has overseen contests by Coca Cola and other
major companies. A letter from the firm, Ventura Associates Inc.,
confirms the selection of Dreizen as winner.
</P>
<P>
   Gnant said he sympathizes with losers, adding, ``These people
poured their hearts and souls into this contest for two years. It
was an addicting game. I spent two weeks playing it and almost went
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there was no celebration of the final results because
his company has switched from computer games to CD-ROM movies, and
he didn't want to spend money on a victory bash. &QL; 
SKEPTICS UNSATISFIED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But those answers don't satisfy the sleuthing skeptics, who even
discovered that P. Dreizen can be reconstructed into a provocative
anagram: ``End Prize.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Boucher, a Colchester, Vt., postal supervisor who spent
vacations working the puzzle, said Treasure Quest is so complex
that no one could solve it alone, yet the winner's name never
surfaced during two years of chat room exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people to take this on blind faith is just stupid,''
Boucher added. ``I'm not a sore loser. If I lost, I lost. But until
these questions are answered, I'm not going to accept the fact that
this P. Dreizen won.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he is one of several players who shifted their
attention from the game mystery to Sirius business.
</P>
<P>
   Among their discoveries, confirmed by Gnant: The publishing
company has cut its staff from 80 employees to 25, closed its
headquarters and moved operations into a warehouse. Gnant said
those moves reflect Sirius' new direction, not financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   James Beckett, a 62-year-old retiree from Corning, N.Y., found a
1991 commercial bankruptcy involving another Gnant business,
Express Technologies Inc., and lawsuits against Sirius alleging
unpaid debts. Gnant said the complaints arose from disputes with
suppliers over unsatisfactory products.
</P>
<P>
   OTHER SUSPICIONS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion about the winner also stems from a dispute over key
literary quotes used in solving the riddle. Wigowsky and others say
the phrases contain errors. Gnant denies there are mistakes and
complains that every bit of information he gives out gets twisted:
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say the grass is green and the sky is blue without
someone saying there's an ulterior motive.''
</P>
<P>
   Disgruntled players plastered Web sites and discussion rooms
with questions, conspiracy theories and a mock game called Treasure
Quash. At least one man logged a complaint with Internet Fraud
Watch.
</P>
<P>
   Beckett said he assumed the game was legitimate because of the
accolades and media hoopla. But problems soon emerged when the
Treasure Quest mastermind, Cerise Casper of Washington, sued Sirius
Publishing over a contract dispute. Before that case was settled
for an undisclosed sum, Casper reportedly made computer contact
with Treasure Quest participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``No sooner do we get into this than Cerise pops up in the chat
rooms, warning us to contact the attorney general,'' Beckett said.
</P>
<P>
   Gnant would not say whether the prize money _ to be paid in
increments of $50,000 a year _ has been set aside in a trust, but
said the funds are ``secure.''
</P>
<P>
   As for whether Sirius profited from selling the software and
related items, he said, ``I think financially it was about a push.
It might have made a couple hundred thousand dollars.'' &QL;

`THE DREAM' TEAMED WITH `AIR?' IT NEARLY HAPPENED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ For a brief moment yesterday afternoon, Houston Rockets
center Hakeem Olajuwon allowed himself to wonder how different his
career would have turned out had Michael Jordan been his teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1984 NBA draft, Ray Patterson _ general manager of
the Rockets _ came close to trading Ralph Sampson to Chicago for
the third pick of the '84 draft, which belonged to the Bulls. The
Rockets used the top pick that year to take Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls used the third pick to draft Jordan. Just imagine how
the NBA landscape would have changed had Olajuwon and Jordan been
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might have been better for me, but I have no regrets about
my career and the road that I've traveled,'' Olajuwon said. ``It's
been very interesting and gratifying for me, and there's no looking
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're on a journey, and I'm still working very hard to
maintain the level of competition and finish my career on a strong
note.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon was in Dallas at Don Carter's All-Star Bowling Lanes to
participate in a celebrity bowling tournament staged by Holy Land
Foundation. The foundation helps raise money for orphan
sponsorships, the homeless and scholarship programs.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, critics have said that if Jordan hadn't left the NBA to
play baseball, the Bulls would have also won NBA titles in 1994 and
'95 _ the years the Rockets were league champions. Olajuwon said
such statements are absurd.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a question that will never be answered,'' Olajuwon
said. ``People that know anything about basketball know that
everything is timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Chicago was winning championships, we were beating them
in the regular season in Chicago and in Houston. As far as I'm
concerned, the second championship that we won , Jordan was there.
He came back and played well, and they lost in the playoffs to
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, my competition is not against Michael, who is a
guard. My competition is Patrick Ewing, Shaquille O'Neal and David
Robinson. So it's gratifying for me to have won the championships
against the premier centers.''
</P>
<P>
   Between them, the Bulls and Rockets have won the past eight NBA
titles. But they've never met in the NBA Finals. It's a matchup
Olajuwon believes would be intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jordan knows, and I know, that there's mutual respect between
the two teams,'' he said. ``When champions see other champions, you
recognize that.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon, 35, is bracing for the NBA's second lockout in three
years. The NBA and the NBA Players Association are trying to
negotiate a contract, and a lockout will likely be imposed unless a
deal is struck by July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're prepared for a lockout, but there's too much at stake,''
Olajuwon said. ``In a lockout situation, no one wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm with the union, and we're going to stick together. But as
businessmen, both parties have to be willing to compromise and find
a happy medium.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets have the 14th, 16th and 18th picks in Wednesday's
NBA draft, and Olajuwon said it's imperative that the picks are
used wisely.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon will have a magnetic resonance imaging exam on his
right knee next month, with hopes of clearing up problems that led
to the least-productive season of his 14-year career. He had
surgery on his left knee this season, forcing him to miss a
career-high 35 games, and leading to him averaging career-lows in
scoring (16.4)) and field-goal percentage (.483).
</P>
<P>
   ``I always looked at the positive things about the season,''
Olajuwon said. ``If I have to have the surgery to finish my career,
then I can finish my career on a strong note, knowing that my knees
are strong.''

 &HT;    Draft passe as way to forge a dynasty
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Barring great fortune, the draft no longer is the way
to build a strong team in the NBA, and the next edition on
Wednesday bears testimony to that.
</P>
<P>
   Sending a warning to fans of the Clippers, Grizzlies and
Nuggets, Detroit vice president for basketball Rick Sund says,
``Anybody who thinks that this draft, even if you do have one of
the first three picks, is going to catapult some team over the hump
is greatly mistaken.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawks general manager Pete Babcock notes, ``The way you build a
team in today's NBA is through trades and free agency.''
</P>
<P>
   What's happened to a cherished institution that still serves the
NFL well? The rules have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Sund's Pistons have the 11th pick Wednesday night. ``Basically,
we expect to be drafting somebody who we might be able to develop
into a player that will help us three or four years down the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, under current rules, a player drafted Wednesday can
become a free agent after three seasons, or about the time he
starts to blossom as a player. That's one of the changes the NBA
wants in its working agreement with the players association. Teams
are asking for options that will add two or three more seasons to a
rookie contract. That would serve to hold down salaries of young
players and also protect the investments of teams that are
building.
</P>
<P>
   Sund recalls that in his years as player personnel chief in
Dallas, the Mavs thrived on the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year we made it to the (Western) conference finals (in
1987), 11 of our 12 players were guys we drafted. Those days are
over. You build teams in thirds now _ one-third draft, one-third
free agents and one-third trades.''
</P>
<P>
   A glance at the top prospects in this draft shows the dilemma
that bad teams face:
</P>
<P>
   Among the projected top players in the draft, guards Mike Bibby,
Paul Pierce, Vince Carter and Larry Hughes, forwards Robert Traylor
and Antawn Jamison and center Nazr Mohammed are all underclassmen.
German Dirk Nowitzki and Houston high-schooler Rashard Lewis did
not go to college. And there are three others also making the jump
from high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to get a read on young players,'' Babcock said.
``It's a huge gamble, and the problem we have is that, the more
young players you have in the draft, the fewer remain to become top
senior talent. Right now, you hope you can find a serviceable
player who can develop.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Tim Duncan of San Antonio and Keith Van Horn of New
Jersey both stayed in college four years, few are induced to follow
their example.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the draft shows this sorry record:
</P>
<P>
   Over the last six years, only a handful of players took the
teams that drafted them from the lottery to the playoffs. The
number includes Kevin Garnett and Stephon Marbury (Minnesota),
Grant Hill (Detroit), Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway (Orlando)
and Alonzo Mourning (Charlotte).
</P>
<P>
   Is that pattern likely to change soon?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Babcock said. ``Under the current rules, the league is
very different.''

 &HT;    Braves vs. Yankees: May the best payroll win
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Please forgive today's hysterical amount of newsprint
devoted to a few baseball games in June, but we feel a little pulp
friction is appropriate here.
</P>
<P>
   The world is not ending. But a thorough audit on the Braves'
ambitions is about to commence.
</P>
<P>
   Big news, the approach of any Braves series that is more than
the usual corporate outing or a nice day for the Newnan Pony
League. You've got to understand that this team, by its consistent
drone atop the standings, can get a little stupefying during the
regular season. We've gone through all the usual adjectives in the
'90s, done just about all the gymnastics possible over the National
League East's Atlanta Foregone Conclusions. There's so little left
to give when they throw at you, as they have these last 10 days, a
steady low-fat diet of Expo and Marlin.
</P>
<P>
   So, when they're off Monday for two games at The House George
Wants To Demolish, returning directly here for two more against the
New York Yankees, it's as good a reason as any to over-react. A
best-of-four might not be the perfect format for deciding the fate
of civilization, but that's how they do dress rehearsals for the
World Series these days.
</P>
<P>
   Know why it's a big deal? It's something different, a boot to
the butt of complacency.
</P>
<P>
   The American League's runaway train vs. The National League's
most solid brick outhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Their go-go offense vs. this one that is more going-going-gone.
</P>
<P>
   Their deep pitching vs. this top-heavy staff (insert bad World
Series flashback here).
</P>
<P>
   May the best payroll win.
</P>
<P>
   Paint the Braves as underdogs. Sports Illustrated already has
bedecked its cover with the New Yorkers along with the headline:
``SPEED POWER HEAT, The Yankees Have it All.'' The best Yankee team
in decades, is the implication. There's experience and savvy to
match that of the Braves. The Atlantans have some serious fighting
to do before they can play the alpha wolf again.
</P>
<P>
   These are the kinds of games that justify the entire concept of
interleague play. All the arguments against it evaporate over the
heat of the next week.
</P>
<P>
   Anything that gets Andruw Jones back to the Bronx, where the kid
homered in his first two World Series at-bats, is worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   What a joy to return to the scene of that '96 Series, where the
locals were serenaded by such memorable refrains from the stands
as, ``Hey, Chippuh! You (stink), Chippuh!''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, they're getting the same sort of tingle about June
baseball in cosmopolitan New York. The press boxes in both cities
reportedly will be filled, a hopeful sign that America still
regards a good baseball game almost as highly as a Nigeria-Paraguay
soccer game (that 1-1 tie is scheduled for Wednesday).
</P>
<P>
   Even as you're reading this, I'm sure the New York Post is
preparing bold headlines for this Series:
</P>
<P>
   ``We Got Your New South Right Here!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Braves Step in El Duque!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Chippuh! You (Stink), Chippuh!''
</P>
<P>
   A warning. We have been through this once before. Last season,
it was a visit by the Baltimore Ripkens that got everyone in a
froth. Neither team kept its Fall Classic appointment, there being
no bacon behind the sizzle.
</P>
<P>
   True, it's not yet the All-Star break. Injuries have just
started to have their say _ note the recent pains to important
Yankees Bernie Williams and Derek Jeter. There's too much baseball
left to be played.
</P>
<P>
   But this is no time for perspective.

<P>
   THE BUILDUP
</P>
<P>
   A few tickets remain for the two-game set in New York after
officials decided to release a few thousand tickets on Friday.
Yankee Stadium, with a capacity of 57,545, is expected to sell out
before gametime. Scalpers in New York are getting more than $300
for box seats close to the field. At Turner Field, which seats
50,062, the Braves will sell 186 skyline seats and probably 3,000
or so $5 standing-room-only tickets. The skyline seats, which cost
$1 each, go on sale about three hours before gametime, and then the
SRO tickets will go on sale. The series will give the Yankees a big
attendance lift. The club has averaged 32,982 a game, but
attendance has dropped below 28,000 during Monday and Tuesday
games. The Braves average 38,088 for the season, but that number
drops to 34,649 for games on Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   THE FOLLOWING
</P>
<P>
   Both press boxes will be overflowing. New York will use its two
auxiliary boxes to accommodate more than 250 media requests.
Atlanta's main box will fill up with double- and triple-staffing by
the New York papers. There have been more than 150 requests, well
above the normal weekly average of 30.
</P>
<P>
   WHY WAIT 'TIL OCTOBER?
</P>
<P>
   That was ESPN Magazine's headline recently for an article about
the significance and excitement surrounding the four games. The
magazine matched the teams for a seven-game series and predicted
the Yankees would win in seven.
</P>
<P>
   ON PACE
</P>
<P>
   At their current rates, both teams could set some records this
year:
</P>
<P>
   Yankees: to win 120 games; the major-league record is 116.
</P>
<P>
   Braves: to win 109 games; the franchise record is 104.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees: to score 1,001 runs; the major-league record is 1,067.
</P>
<P>
   Braves: to hit 231 homers; the NL record is 221.
</P>
<P>
   Braves: to have three 20-game winners _ Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine
and Kevin Millwood.
</P>
<P>
   Braves first baseman Andres Galarraga: to hit 55 homers and
drive in 149 runs.

 &HT;    Simulation? Bullpen shaky, Braves lose 3
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- When the four-game series between the Braves and
Yankees ends Thursday night, baseball fans will have a better idea
of how these teams match up. But the AJC didn't want to wait that
long, so we asked Diamond Mind Baseball, a computer baseball game,
to handle the simulation.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond Mind fed into its computers a detailed set of ratings
for batting, pitching, fielding and other baseball skills. The
company simulated every pitch, even factoring in pitcher fatigue
based on the number of pitches thrown. The game includes a computer
manager who made all tactical decisions.
</P>
<P>
   While both teams have injuries _ New York's Bernie Williams is
out, for example _ the AJC elected to play the computer games with
the teams at full strength. The pitching matchups for each game
were projected last Monday, but have changed. The lineups are based
on the players the teams typically use against right- and
left-handed pitchers. Players were rated by current and past
performances, with emphasis on how they are playing now.
</P>
<P>
   And the results? The Yankees won three of four games. Atlanta's
bullpen failed to keep leads in two of the games. Each team scored
25 runs, although the Braves outhit the Yankees for average, .295
to .252. For the series, Scott Brosius led the Yankees offensively,
going 5-for-15 with two homers. Andres Galarraga hit three homers
and drove in eight runs for the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   GAME 1:
</P>
<P>
   Yankees 5, Braves 4
</P>
<P>
   (12 innings)
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scored two runs in the first and kept that lead
until the eighth, when Ryan Klesko homered off reliever Mike
Stanton, a former Brave. The Braves then took a two-run lead in the
12th on a homer by Andres Galarraga. But New York got to Mark
Wohlers in the bottom of the inning and tied the score on an
infield single by Derek Jeter. Dennis Martinez replaced Wohlers and
walked in the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   GAME 2:
</P>
<P>
   Braves 8, Yankees 5
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scored early, extending Tom Glavine's first-inning
problems, but he shut down New York through eight innings. Atlanta
built an 8-2 lead with Danny Bautista's two-run double and
Galarraga's two-run homer. Yankees starter Andy Pettitte gave up
six runs. But the Braves bullpen made it interesting again,
allowing the Yankees to score three runs in the bottom of the ninth
against Kerry Ligtenberg.
</P>
<P>
   GAME 3:
</P>
<P>
   Yankees 6, Braves 5
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius gave the Yankees the lead with a two-run homer in
the third, then added a solo shot in the fifth. The Yankees scored
another in the sixth to lead 4-0 before Atlanta made it 4-3 in the
bottom of the sixth on a two-run double by Chipper Jones and
Galarraga's RBI single. New York scored two in the eighth to lead
6-3 before the Braves rallied in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   GAME 4:
</P>
<P>
   Yankees 9, Braves 8
</P>
<P>
   It started off as a pitchers' duel between Kevin Millwood and
David Wells, but with the scored tied at 1 in the sixth, the Braves
scored seven runs. Michael Tucker began the rally with a solo
homer. But the Yankees scored four off Millwood in the seventh, and
the Braves bullpen blew up again, with Ligtenberg and Alan Embree
combining to give up four runs. It was the second blown save of the
series for Atlanta.

 &HT;    Two for the show
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- George Steinbrenner, the ``Boss'' of the New York
Yankees, is sitting in his office, thinking ahead to this week's
four-game series against Atlanta and chuckling about his
counterpart with the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Ted Turner) probably said I am a preppy, prep-school,
blue-blazer-type guy. Which I am,'' said Steinbrenner, who also
owns a shipbuilding operation. ``Ted Turner is a free-spirit
dresser, and he is a free-spirit human being, which I love about
him. I think it's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Turner also is laughing. He's sitting in the CNN Center in
downtown Atlanta, remembering the first time he met Steinbrenner.
``It was like a rookie looking up at Hank Aaron,'' said Turner,
vice chairman of Time Warner and owner of the Atlanta Braves.
``When they made George, they definitely broke the mold. He's
definitely one of a kind.''
</P>
<P>
   If baseball ever needed an odd couple among its ownership, it
got it in Turner and Steinbrenner, two of the richest and most
powerful men in sports. Ted and George. George and Ted. Instead of
well-worn adjectives to describe the two, just recall that Turner
has gone to great financial lengths to save the world, and
Steinbrenner has gone to great lengths to control it.
</P>
<P>
   George's main concern at the moment is whether he can force the
city of New York to tear down Yankee Stadium and build him a new
ballpark. Ted's main concern is about nuclear testing in India and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   That makes the upcoming series between the owners' baseball
teams more than a brief recreational respite from a mundane summer
schedule that has both teams threatening to lead their respective
divisions by double figures. In June.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun in 1996, and it is going to be fun again,''
Steinbrenner said, referring to the Yankees' victory over the
Braves in the '96 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a really hard one,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   But Turner and Atlanta have persevered. And Steinbrenner and New
York have persevered. In fact, that's why George and Ted are fond
of each other.
</P>
<P>
   Sort of. George says the two don't exchange Christmas gifts, but
if they did, he'd get Ted something special. ``I wouldn't buy him a
present; I would give him something I value very much, something
that was very valuable to me that I had achieved, hoping that he
understands I was parting with it for a person I think the world
of.''
</P>
<P>
   And Turner? ``What would I buy George? ... I don't know _ a
power hitter?''
</P>
<P>
   Ted says he hasn't talked with George lately, but he is aware
that a character portraying George was a big hit on the
``Seinfeld'' television show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I have watched it; it's (Time Warner's) show,''
Turner said. But he admitted he hasn't seen many of the episodes.
``I've watched three or four, and there are 200 or something I
haven't seen. I'm more interested in trying to get the nuclear
situation back on the agenda, now that India and Pakistan exploded
bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   When the series begins in New York on Monday, the smartly
dressed Steinbrenner will be sitting in his club-level box, rocking
away in his leather recliner. And when the series shifts back to
Atlanta on Wednesday, Turner, in his best free-spirit attire, will
be watching from his seat near the field, jabbering away.
</P>
<P>
   Turner will have his hands on a soft drink; Steinbrenner will
have his hands on the controls.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Steinbrenner has never been more involved with the
operations of the Yankees. He's making personnel decisions for the
team, and some people contend that he's even calling the clubhouse
to make moves during the game. George says it's not so. ``I never
called the dugout on what to do in a game,'' he said. ``Never.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner, on the other hand, has never been so far removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss being more hands-on now that the team has had so much
success ever since I got my hands off,'' Turner says. ``I'd love to
be (team president) Stan Kasten. I'd love to be more involved.
Remember my slogan: `Lead, follow or get out of the way.' And I
have gotten out of the way with my sports teams. It's worked out
better that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner, 60, paid $10 million for the Braves in 1976 and became
the proud owner of one of the worst franchises in sports.
Steinbrenner, 67, bought the Yankees in 1973 for $8.8 million and
had one of the best.
</P>
<P>
   From the very first meeting, Steinbrenner recalls that Turner
seemed preoccupied with bigger things.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sitting at a bar talking after a meeting of
baseball,'' Steinbrenner said. ``He was complaining that he was
going up to his room to watch the news. It was 6 (p.m.), and he was
going to excuse himself from us. He was complaining about how bad
it was, the only time you could find out what was going on in the
world was at 6 and noon, and in between you are in a blank. He was
saying he thought he would do something about it. I swear to God, I
can remember the story like it was yesterday. And a year or so
later, he founded CNN.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner also liked Steinbrenner from the start. ``I guess George
was considered sort of a rebel among the baseball establishment, so
we had a natural affinity,'' he said. ``We were both considered bad
boys.''
</P>
<P>
   With good reason. Both men pushed baseball's envelope. Turner
once rolled a ball around the bases with his nose and rode an
ostrich in an on-field race. He was suspended by commissioner Bowie
Kuhn for taking over as manager for one Braves game.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner, just as outrageous, once dropped his pants for a
skit on ``Saturday Night Live'' and agreed to be photographed in a
Napoleon costume for Sports Illustrated. He was suspended twice,
once by Kuhn for illegal contributions to Richard Nixon's political
campaign and once by commissioner Faye Vincent for hiring a private
investigator to follow Dave Winfield, a Yankees player.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Ted and I) weren't Bowie Kuhn's types,'' Steinbrenner said.
``We dressed as we wished, and we didn't wear the black silk
stockings. (Kuhn) kind of had us targeted, the two of us. When Ted
was suspended for going into the dugout, I went and argued on his
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came into baseball, you walked in your first
(owners) meeting, and the American League sat on one side of the
room and the National League on the other. And the sanctimonious
group in front. It was like Appomattox Courthouse, the North vs.
the South. There was no togetherness. Ted was like a breath of
fresh air in there. Few of them realized it at the time. Geez, we
needed something to make it more exciting, and Ted made it more
exciting for fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner credits Turner with changing the complexion of the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason baseball has the television contract it does today
is because of Ted Turner,'' Steinbrenner said. ``He stood up in the
meeting and talked about television, and Bowie paid no attention to
him and kind of wrote him off.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner hasn't been written off since.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner said he and Turner did not make a bet during the
1996 World Series, and he doesn't expect to do it this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had won, I couldn't have paid him,'' Steinbrenner said.
But there's another side to that story: Steinbrenner knows Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much money do I think Ted is carrying in his pocket right
now?'' Steinbrenner asked. ``Not enough to buy us lunch.''

 &HT;    What they're saying
 &HT;    By .J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Fifteen of the nation's foremost baseball writers
provide their thoughts on which team is better _ Yankees or Braves:
</P>
<P>
   MURRAY CHASS, New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I have to say the Yankees, because they can't do
anything wrong. (Monday) is a perfect example of it. They were
playing Baltimore, down 3-0, and Ricky Ledee, who is replacing
Bernie Williams, comes up and hits a three-run homer. No matter who
is injured, somebody fills in. As good as the Braves starters are,
the Yankees have six. None of them might be Greg Maddux, but they
are deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   JERRY CRASNICK, Bloomberg Sports:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Yankees are the best, because I really have a lot
of concern about the Braves bullpen. They seem to be very
vulnerable in the late innings. The Yankees just seem to have a
certain something that few teams have. They seem to have a certain
intangible; they have a lot of guys who know how to win.''

   HAL BODLEY, USA Today:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that probably for this year the Yankees are a better
team. But if you factor in the experience and pitching staff of the
Braves, they would have to get the edge. What I am saying is
everything is going right for the Yankees right now, but over the
long haul I think the Braves have the better team.''
</P>
<P>
   TOM KEEGAN, New York Post:
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say the Yankees, because they can beat you more ways.
They have speed, power, a real high on-base percentages and a deep
rotation like the Braves, a deeper bullpen than the Braves and a
deeper bench. And when you get to the postseason, I think it tends
to be low-scoring games, and not as many mistakes are made. So you
have to be able to win games other than hitting home runs, and I
think the Yankees have more ways to win games than the Braves.''
</P>
<P>
   LARRY STONE, Seattle Times:
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I would give the edge to the Yankees based on the
overall depth and bullpen. The Yankees have a guy go down, and they
have an All-Star caliber player to step in. They also have the best
bullpen in baseball. But the Braves aren't far behind.''
</P>
<P>
   MARC TOPKIN, St. Petersburg Times:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees are better. They have more ways to beat you. Right
now it is an easy pick.''
</P>
<P>
   BILL MADDEN, New York Daily News:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees are better for a number of reasons. No. 1 is the
bullpen. Obviously, the Braves bullpen has been their Achilles'
heel, and the Yankees have a deep bullpen. Another strength that
the Yankees have big-time over the Braves is their depth. The
Braves bench is very shallow compared to the Yankees. Braves. Both
are solid managers, and I don't think you could give either one the
edge. (Bobby) Cox's biggest problem is when he has to take out his
starters and go to that bullpen. When you take out Greg Maddux, and
the bullpen blows the game, any manager looks bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ROSS NEWHAN, Los Angeles Times:
</P>
<P>
   ``Right the Yankees slightly. I think they have better bullpen
depth, better bench depth and (are) stronger right now at second
and shortstop.''
</P>
<P>
   BOB ELLIOTT, Toronto Sun:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Yankees are the best. Atlanta is the home of the
WCW, and New York is closer to WWF headquarters. You know, the big
wrestling argument. And I think a lot of people argue about whether
the Braves are better or the Yankees. I think the difference is
Bernie Williams.''
</P>
<P>
   TOM VERDUCCI, Sports Illustrated:
</P>
<P>
   ``I give the edge to the Yankees. They have better depth,
especially in the bullpen. I do think these two teams are extremely
close, but I give the Yankees a very slight edge.''
</P>
<P>
   PAUL NEWBERRY, Associated Press, Atlanta:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Yankees are the better team right now. They seem
to have all facets of their game in order. That could change if the
Braves get their bullpen in order. I don't think there is a big
difference, but there is this uncertainty to the Braves bullpen
which gives the Yankees the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   STEVE MARANTZ, The Sporting News:
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a tough one. I would say the Yankees are better
because of their bench and bullpen. I think they maybe are better
offensively, top to bottom. The Braves clearly have the better
three starters. John Smoltz is a big element for the Braves and is
a question mark for this season. They seem less formidable without
him.''
</P>
<P>
   PETE WILLIAMS, USA Baseball Weekly:
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say until the Braves resolve their bullpen situation,
the Yankees look like the better team. I would say also on the
bench, and the Yankees don't have Chili Davis. I know bullpen and
bench are two areas that John Schuerholz traditionally addresses
around the trading deadline. But going into this series, I think
the Yankees clearly have a better team.''
</P>
<P>
   JON HEYMAN, Newsday:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Yankees are slightly better, because they have a
little more balance in their lineup and a little more depth on the
bench. I think top to bottom, the Yankee lineup is more difficult
to pitch to. Everybody is a threat in the Yankee lineup, while the
Braves rely more on a few great players.''
</P>
<P>
   PETER SCHMUCK, Baltimore Sun:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to go with the Braves. I just think that the Braves
starting rotation is more proven. It is no secret that it is the
best in baseball, and the Yankees are probably second-best. The
thing with the Yankees, they are depending on guys without knowing
if they can go the distance. Who knows what (Hideki) Irabu is going
to do in the second half? Offensively, I would have to give the
Yankees the advantage. The Braves pitching outweighs an offensive
advantage for the Yankees.''

 &HT;    On deck: Montreal expos
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 1:35 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: TBS and 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: LHP Denny Neagle (8-4, 3.18; 5-6,
3.96 lifetime vs. Expos) vs. RHP Dustin Hermanson (4-6, 3.20; 0-2,
5.40 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Neagle broke a personal three-game losing streak in his
last outing Tuesday. Against a weak Florida lineup, he threw a
four-hit shutout and beat the Marlins 7-0. He struck out nine and
walked none. On June 5 of last season, Neagle shut out the Expos
9-0 in the Big O on a six-hitter. But he lost his next two starts
against the Expos, lasting six innings here in a 6-2 loss last July
6 before being pounded for four homers in 5 2/3 innings in a 7-1
loss Sept. 21 in Atlanta. Rondell White homered twice that day and
has three career homers against Neagle, batting .360 (9-for-25).
Shane Andrews (6-for-14, .429, one homer) also hits Neagle well.
Neagle had allowed 14 homers this year _ just four less than he
gave up all last season. Although he has a losing record, Hermanson
has statistically been Montreal's most effective starter.

 &HT;    Wanted: bullpen help
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The Braves are not the only ones with bullpen
problems.
</P>
<P>
   With offensive numbers typically exaggerated in an expansion
season, everyone seems to be looking for relief.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Yankees. New York has the best record in baseball, yet
has a bullpen ERA of 4.59, eighth among AL clubs and 20th in the
majors. The Braves, with the second-best mark in the majors, have
an ERA of 4.41. Houston, leading the NL Central, has struggled at
times, as have the Angels, now on top in the AL West. The average
bullpen ERA is 4.54 in the AL, 3.86 in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, after the All-Star break, the top teams are likely
to scramble for relievers on clubs that are out of contention.
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh, but a pitcher like Arizona veteran Gregg Olson, who
has played on seven teams in the last five seasons trying to
rediscover his glory days with the Orioles, will be of high value.
Olson has 10 saves, two more than Atlanta's Mark Wohlers, and a
better ERA, 3.82, to 5.63 for Wohlers. The top name out there might
well be Toronto's Randy Myers. The Blue Jays are having another
disappointing season and could be willing to deal Myers, even
though the price probably would be high. But Myers has been the
majors' most consistent closer the last six years, averaging 38
saves a season. And while his ERA of 3.90 is high for a top
reliever, he has 18 saves this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ugueth Urbina of Montreal is another possibility. Urbina is
costing the Expos only $550,000, but Montreal might be tempted if
it gets some starting pitching prospects, which the organization
lacks. Urbina has 17 saves and a 1.56 ERA on a team that is 29-42
and has an ERA of 4.46.
</P>
<P>
   But the player who might be the easiest to obtain is
Philadelphia's Mark Leiter, who has done a good job filling in for
disabled Ricky Bottalico. Leiter has 13 saves, but Bottalico is
close to returning. The Phillies, who have built a nice young
nucleus, can afford to deal Leiter.
</P>
<P>
   Other closers who might be had for a price are Cincinnati's Jeff
Shaw (18 saves), Colorado's Jerry Dipoto (14), Pittsburgh's Rich
Loiselle (12), Minnesota's Rick Aguilera (14) and Oakland's Billy
Taylor (13).
</P>
<P>
   Come August, you can bet some of those closers will be wearing
different uniforms.

 &HT;    Keeping up with Jones just too much
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Of the options Marion Jones had on the table when
she left the North Carolina campus with her communications degree
last spring, the one that seemed the riskiest was a track and field
career. She'd made a splash as a 16-year-old at the 1992 Olympic
Trials, finishing fourth in the 200 meters. But she'd broken a foot
twice trying to ready herself for the 1996 Atlanta Games _ never
making it to the trials.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, a pro basketball career looked like money in the
bank. The two new leagues were hustling for talent. Here Jones was
an All-American at Carolina, whose point guard skills had led the
Tar Heels to a national title only a couple of years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to the surprise of many, she ventured down the road of less
guarantees and now has put herself in position to be crowned the
queen of U.S. track and field. Jones only aided her calling
Saturday night, putting her winning stamp on both the 100 meters
and long jump at the USA Track and Field Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Her 100-meter time of 10.72 was seventh-fastest ever, coming
after a championship-meet record 10.71 in the semifinals. About an
hour after her sprint victory, Jones went 23 feet, 8 inches on her
opening effort to win the long jump. And then, despite pulling up
with 30 meters left, followed it up with a 22.46 in the semis of
the 200 _ second-best in the world this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I could run a little faster (in the 100), but I had
two other events and I'm just glad to be healthy,'' Jones said.
``I'm due for a rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, she's a heavy favorite to seal her triple with a victory
in the 200 meters. With a sharp eye on Sydney in 2000, Jones is
talking a possible five gold medal performance (including two
relays) _ something never accomplished in the sport. Here she is
earning well into six-figures, more than the pro leagues could
offer. And this on top of her Nike shoe deal.
</P>
<P>
   The career choice, it seems, as turned out just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't miss (basketball) as much as people might think, or as
much as I thought I might,'' Jones said. ``I'm sure I would miss it
a lot more if I wasn't as successful in this sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't look back and second-guess myself. I was a very
successful high school track and field athlete, but I put it on the
back burner at North Carolina. I just missed the sport. I missed it
watching the Olympic Games on TV. It motivated me to come back and
compete.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was any rust, Jones shed it quickly last summer en
route to winning the 100 meters at both the national and World
Championships. Track &AMP; Field News was impressed enough to name her
Women's Athlete of the Year _ not just in America, but the world.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about recent American sprinters Gail Devers and Gwen
Torrence, they couldn't touch the times Jones is putting down. She
owns the world's best performance this year in her three events _
100, 200 and long jump _ and for the first time in a decade
Florence Griffith-Joyner's sprint records are in jeopardy. And yet
because of her awesome speed, Jones' best showing yet may come in
the long jump.
</P>
<P>
   At the Prefontaine Classic last month, Jones took the long jump
with a 23-11 3/4 leap, 7 3/4 inches off the world record in only
her sixth major long jump competition. That's without much training
and with only basic technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that (jump), a young woman came up to me and said: 'You
know, if you learned how to land you could really be dangerous,'''
Jones said of a foreign competitor, a woman whose name she couldn't
recall. ``I looked at her and said, 'Yeah, if you guys learned how
to run so could you.'''
</P>
<P>
   For now, no one can stay with Jones.

 &HT;    Stewart still solid in lead
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- How fitting for the man in the knickers. His
lead over the field entering today's final round of the 98th U.S.
Open?
</P>
<P>
   Plus Four.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Kuchar's brush with immortality notwithstanding, the 98th
U.S. Open has been all Payne Stewart. If the storyline changes
today and Stewart fails to finish off a wire-to-wire performance _
the first in a U.S. Open since Tony Jacklin in 1970 _ he would be
surprised if it involves a self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I've been here before,'' Stewart said. ``I've done this.
I'm a champion. There's no reason I can't stand up there and be a
champion tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   While others were struggling Saturday in fast, sun-baked
conditions that forced precision shots to find the fairway and some
luck to find the cup, Stewart remained solid with an even-par 70,
finishing at 3-under-par 207, four strokes ahead of Tom Lehman (68)
and former Marietta player Bob Tway (73), who are at 1-over 211.
</P>
<P>
   Five shots back at 2-over 212 are Zimbabwe's Nick Price (71) and
1993 U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen (73).
</P>
<P>
   Former Georgia Tech player Stewart Cink of Smyrna is tied for
eighth, remaining in contention at 4-over 214 after a 73.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to win his third major today, the champion of the
1991 U.S. Open and 1989 PGA figures he only has to maintain what
brought him to this point. Stewart, 41, started the week with a 66
and hasn't faded. He began Saturday's round with an eagle at the
first hole and hung on.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I think that I played the first few rounds with smoke and
mirrors, I'd be kidding myself,'' Stewart said. ``There's no reason
I shouldn't come out and play good golf tomorrow. If I come out and
let the situation intimidate me, then that's my own fault. But
there's no reason why in my mind I won't come out and win the golf
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kuchar, who turns 20 today, were to manage it now, it would
require a miracle. Finally encountering difficulties Saturday, the
U.S. Amateur champion from Georgia Tech bogeyed four of the last
five holes for a 76 and stands nine shots back at 5-over 215.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have the 'A' game that I had that first two days,''
Kuchar said. ``It was just a tiny bit lower. I wasn't hitting my
irons as crisp. ... I think it was the shoes. I changed shoes to
match my outfit today, so I think I'll wear the same shoes I wore
the first two days. I'll wear my birthday outfit and see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a different role today for Lehman, who has slept on the
54-hole Open lead the last three years and failed to win. But a 68
returned his confidence level after a Friday 75.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew if I just maintained my composure and kept my head,
that I could get back in the tournament,'' Lehman said. ``I don't
think (the Open) owes me one. I think I owe myself one, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Tway figured the tournament is hardly decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was in Payne's position and I had a four-shot lead, I
wouldn't feel too very safe,'' Tway said.

BOSTON GLOBE VERIFIES SOURCES OF A COLUMNIST  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Boston Globe, answering allegations that its star
columnist, Mike Barnicle, had fabricated material in his work,
announced on Saturday that it had checked 364 of Barnicle's columns
and confirmed the existence of the people who were portrayed and
quoted.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came on Saturday in the wake of accusations by
Professor Alan Dershowitz of the Harvard Law School that The Globe
could have been guilty of applying a double standard based on
gender and race when it asked for the resignation of Patricia
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith, the only black female columnist at a major Boston
newspaper, resigned on Thursday after she admitted fabricating
information in her columns.
</P>
<P>
   Dershowitz, who is white, has accused Barnicle, who is also
white, of falsely attributing a racist, sexist quote to him in a
1990 column.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's Globe, Barnicle staunchly denied any fabrications,
saying: ``Every time I have gone into The Globe and sat down and
written my column for the last 25 years, I have never violated the
trust, faith, and confidence I hope my readers have placed in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Editors and librarians at The Globe checked the sources in 364
of Barnicle's columns through computer data bases and discussions
with the writer, Matthew V. Storin, the editor of The Globe,
announced on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Though such a review has obvious limitations, Storin said, The
Globe believes those columns met professional standards, adding:
``His style has sometimes been controversial, and he has collected
a good number of critics and enemies over the years. But that does
not justify linking him with the misdeeds of Patricia Smith. For
those who would attempt to do so, I would urge great caution.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe, which is owned by The New York Times Co., has
occasionally checked the veracity of its Metro columnists' writings
since January of 1996, but undertook a full review of Barnicle's
work in light of Ms. Smith's admissions and Dershowitz's
allegations. The Globe is continuing to review the columns written
by Ms. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle complained in The Globe on Saturday that ``a pack of
parasites has been participating in a feeding frenzy over the
misfortune of others. As for Alan Dershowitz, he is simply running
true to form.''

NBA LABOR NEGOTIATIONS GOING NOWHERE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The lasting image of Michael Jordan's epic,
title-clinching shot in Game 6 of the NBA Finals may have to last a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   By all appearances, the NBA is about to go into protracted
hibernation, and nightly SportsCenter images of Jordan and Pippen
will soon be replaced by Italian-suited attorneys muttering
something about ``base-year compensation.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA and the players association have nine days to break a
three-month stalemate on a new labor pact or face another
owners-imposed lockout of the players _ the league's second labor
stoppage in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Free agents will be frozen out. There will be no trades, no
player signings, no summer pro leagues, no NBA stars in the World
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the two sides are so entrenched that the NBA faces the
very real possibility of tarnishing its record as the only U.S.
professional sports league never to lose regular-season games to a
labor stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it certainly doesn't look good right now. We've got
less than two weeks left, and we really haven't made much
progress,'' said Russ Granik, NBA deputy commissioner and the
league's chief negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides are far apart right now,'' said Dan Wasserman,
spokesman for the players association.
</P>
<P>
   That's about as much as the two sides agree on, and that's bad
news for the league and for fans. Come July 1 _ the day free agents
are eligible to negotiate new contracts _ the owners will almost
certainly impose a lockout, leaving teams and players in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   The owners voted earlier this year to reopen the collective
bargaining agreement signed in 1995. Granik and Billy Hunter,
executive director of the players association, have met 10 times
since April 1, and are no closer to reaching agreement on the
fundamental issue _ the clause that allows teams to ignore the
salary cap when re-signing their free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Granik and Hunter will meet again Monday in what could be a
make-or-break negotiating session.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not optimistic right now about getting much done before
July 1,'' Granik said.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   At least a half-dozen issues _ including the length of rookie
contracts and testing players for marijuana use _ are on the table,
but there is only one deal-breaker: the so-called ``Larry Bird''
exception to the salary cap. It's the Bird clause that allows, for
example, the Chicago Bulls to sign Jordan to a $35 million annual
salary despite a leaguewide salary cap of $26.9 million per team.
</P>
<P>
   This ``soft cap'' has, according to Granik, thrown the league's
entire economy out of whack. Revenues are growing, but expenses _
i.e. player salaries _ are far outpacing that growth, according to
the league.
</P>
<P>
   When the players and owners signed the current pact and salary
structure in 1995, they agreed players would receive at least 48
percent of NBA revenues. This season the players' salaries totaled
57 percent, far exceeding the 51.8 percent trigger that allowed the
owners to reopen the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Granik said the NBA paid $1 billion in salaries and benefits
this year, $165 million more than projected.
</P>
<P>
   The league claims 14 to 15 teams will finish in the red this
year. The union claims the number is closer to four or five, and
the players association also notes that major-league baseball and
the NFL pay players 60 to 70 percent of revenues.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the NBA has not strayed from its insistence on a
``hard'' cap, meaning a phase-out of the Bird exception and an end
to the brief era of $100 million contracts. The hard cap is
anathema to the players, who view the Bird exception as an
untouchable issue.
</P>
<P>
   It may take the threat of canceling games this November to move
anyone toward center court.

VICTIM ALIVE, BUT BULLET KILLED HOPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KARINA BLAND  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lynn Andrews was 14 when he was shot.
</P>
<P>
   The girl who shot him was angry, he says, because he wouldn't
lend her a 2Pac Shakur CD.
</P>
<P>
   The bullet struck him high in the chest, where his shoulder
blade and upper arm meet.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said he may never use his right arm again _ a
devastating diagnosis for an all-star baseball player who dreamed
of playing professionally. Amazingly, he's be gun to throw again.
</P>
<P>
   Like most other shootings in Arizona in 1997, last summer's
attack didn't even make the news.
</P>
<P>
   But the shot from that .44 Magnum changed the lives of Lynn and
nearly everyone around him, showing just how devastating one bullet
can be. Here are their stories: &QL; 
 &UR; Lynn Andrews
</P>
<P>
   Lynn is a tall, good looking kid from south Phoenix. He has
hazel eyes and a small silver hoop in his left ear.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the afternoon of Aug. 6, he and his best friend, Eddie
Gardner, were at the trailer where a 14-year-old girl lived with
her mother. They were listening to CDs and tidying up the trailer.
</P>
<P>
   They all knew the gun was there.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the girl took it into the kitchen sometime
after 7:30 p.m. and Lynn followed her. Gard ner says he heard Lynn
ask, ``You're not going to shoot me, are you?''
</P>
<P>
   Then a shot was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn says she shot him on purpose, angry that he would not let
her keep the CD at her house for a while longer. She told police it
was an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn stumbled back into the living room and lay on the floor,
blood pouring from his chest. The CD supposedly in dispute kept
playing _ Shakur's &UR; All Eyez on Me.
</P>
<P>
   Gunfire is part of the nightly serenade in Lynn's neighborhood,
just south of Seventh and Dobbins avenues and not far from the
Phoenix Police Academy shooting range. Still, Lynn never thought he
would get hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never, ever crossed my mind,'' he says. ``Not me.''
</P>
<P>
   He never cried. And the girl never returned the CD.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Before he was shot, Lynn was cocky, he admits, not wanting to
listen to what his parents told him. Now, when they ask where he is
going and when he will be back, he answers them with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to look at it from their point of view,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   If he is outside _ at the park or walking home from school _ and
hears gunfire, he takes off running.
</P>
<P>
   The night before Lynn was shot, he played in an all-star
baseball game. He was hospitalized for three days. Now, almost a
year later, Lynn can move his arm and even throw a ball.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he can't open his hand. His fingers remain clenched. He's
em barrassed by it, tucking his hand behind his hip. But he can put
a ball in his hand and release it _ a throw he's working on. Lynn
started back to school as a freshman at South Mountain High in
February, writing with his left hand. Only a few friends know he
was shot. Few of his teachers know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want anybody to think I'm getting special
privileges,'' Lynn says. ``Besides, I'm afraid to tell people. I
feel like I'm retarded or something.''
</P>
<P>
   This would have been his first year playing baseball at South
Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could probably play, but it wouldn't be 100 percent, and I
don't want anyone babying me,'' Lynn says.
</P>
<P>
   So, for now, he helps his father coach his little brother's
baseball team and watches Arizona State University and the Arizona
Dia mondbacks on television.
</P>
<P>
   He works his arm constantly _ squeezing balls, lifting weights,
stretching. Lynn wants to play for ASU and then for the Diamond
backs, though he's never been to a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want the chance,'' he says. ``It's all I've ever
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lynn picks a baseball bat out of the dirt and adds, ``You
can't always get what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Not just because of his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a kid living in south Phoenix,'' he says. ``Nothing ever
happens down here.'' &QL; 
 &UR; Darlene Andrews
</P>
<P>
   Lynn's mother is a nervous wreck.
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, the bullet shattered her assumption that her
children would be with her always, she would watch them graduate
from high school, then college, see them go to work, grow into
adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear sirens, and I think it's one of my kids,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She holds her breath each time. Before the shooting, she thought
the worse thing that could happen to one of her children would be a
car accident. She never imagined the bullet hole in her son's
chest.
</P>
<P>
   Darlene, 36, is the mother all the neighborhood kids go to,
either with their problems at home or for something to eat after
school.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting, the children comforted her, even Lynn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Mom, don't worry about it. I'll use my hand,' '' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Darlene is angry. The shooting wasn't an accident, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That girl cocked that gun, pointed it at Lynn and pulled the
trigger,'' she says. ``She tried to kill my son.''
</P>
<P>
   Darlene has dogged police, pros ecutors and anyone else who will
listen.
</P>
<P>
   The family has health insurance, so Lynn's medical bills are
paid. It's not about that, she says. She simply can't believe that
one child can shoot another with no punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't just another shoot ing in south Phoenix,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   But it was.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mark Andrews Sr.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn's father grew up in south Phoenix in the 1960s. At 44, he
remembers a near-perfect childhood.
</P>
<P>
   The clusters of houses were surrounded by fields. Kids dug
trenches and played tag. They climbed trees and ate the fruit for
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me sad that my kids can't do the same thing,'' Mark
says. ``It's sad that Lynn can't go out and be free, because
someone will blow him away.''
</P>
<P>
   The shooting has taught Mark that no matter what he does as a
father _ setting curfews, teaching manners and what's right and
wrong, instilling a belief in God _ there's little he can do to
protect his kids once they leave his house.
</P>
<P>
   But this man _ watching Lynn hit grounders to the younger
players _ is not angry. He takes a drag on a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to think about the law,'' he says. ``You have to
think about what God would think.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't like guns, doesn't keep one in his house.
</P>
<P>
   The Andrews family is close. Mark and his wife, married for 16
years, hug and kiss their children and tell them that they are
loved. It is hard for this man who survived heart surgery just a
few months ago to understand the disregard for life that led to the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like they don't care,'' he says. ``For some people, it's
like stepping on a bug. I don't step on a bug unless I have to.''
</P>
<P>
   He watches his oldest son pop ping baseballs into center field.
He never doubted that Lynn would recover, Mark says, looking at the
sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep the faith,'' he says. &QL; 
 &UR; Eddie Gardner
</P>
<P>
   Lynn's best friend, Eddie Gardner, 17, a sophomore at South
Mountain High, is uncomfortable talking about the day his buddy was
shot. He still sees it in his mind, especially when he is trying to
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner froze when the gun was fired that day. He saw Lynn
stumble into the living room and to the floor, blood pouring from
his chest and back. He ran to the home of a neighbor for help.
Meanwhile, the girl called 911.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner ran to Lynn's trailer to get his mother. By the time he
got back, paramedics and police had arrived. Gardner was out of
breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping he wouldn't die,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner was so shaken by seeing his best friend shot that he saw
a counselor, Darlene says. The boy has lived in this neighborhood
for a long time and seen a lot of violence, heard a lot of
gunshots, but this, Darlene says, was too close.
</P>
<P>
   The boys live in the same trailer park, go to the same school
and played on the same baseball team. They are always together.
Gardner seems afraid to let Lynn out of his sight, Darlene says.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner believes they will play baseball together again. At
practice, Gardner watches Lynn hit ground ers, his bad hand wrapped
around the neck of a baseball bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think he'd do that good,'' Gardner says. ``That makes
me real proud of him.'' &QL; 
 &UR; Amber Andrews
</P>
<P>
   Amber, 13, was outside when Gardner ran up, yelling for her to
get her mother. She ran to the other trailer, but a neighbor kept
her from going inside. Through the doorway, she could see Lynn
lying on the floor _ and all of the blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Oh, my God, he's going to die,' Amber says. ``I
started bawling.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn keeps an eye on Amber, a seventh grader, she says, making
sure she stays out of trouble. He shoos away any boys who show an
interest in her. And as annoying as her big brother can be, Amber
says she can't imagine life without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't be the same fam ily,'' Amber says.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting of her brother has made her afraid. Her parents
don't let her go to the mall with friends or to the nearby park as
often.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know if someone's going to be around the corner. You
just never know,'' she says. &QL; 
 &UR; Mark Andrews Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Like his big brother, Mark An drews Jr., 12, plays catcher. He
is a seventh grader, a smart kid who skipped third grade. He built
a fort in the desert near the trailer park but is not allowed to go
there by himself anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been scared of guns, but ever since my brother got
shot, I've been really scared,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mark Jr. was outside playing his keyboard when Lynn was shot.
He dropped the instrument and ran for the other trailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was blood everywhere,'' Mark Jr. says. ``I didn't know
what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing for a 12-year-old boy to do but wait. He
waited while paramedics loaded Lynn into the ambulance and then
waited at the hospital. Then, he waited three days for his brother
to come home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't die,'' Mark Jr. says, shaking his head and
flicking sweat from his brow. He takes a drink from a near empty
water bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need him.'' &QL; 
 &UR; The police detective
</P>
<P>
   The case was turned down for prosecution by a grand jury, says
Phoenix Police Detective Bob Hutchins, a 28-year veteran who
investigated the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   No one will ever know for sure if the shooting was an accident,
he says, adding that he doesn't think the girl shot Lynn
intentionally.
</P>
<P>
   But, says Hutchins, who inter viewed the girl twice, she never
showed any remorse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be some account ability,'' he says. ``Every &UR; day,
there's somebody's who's affected like this. These punks, they just
don't realize what they're doing. There's no value on life
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Problem was, the neighborhood kids _ even Lynn _ said at first
that it had to be an accident. After all, they were friends.
</P>
<P>
   And by the time the grand jury made its decision, the 60-day
dead line to submit charges in juvenile court had passed.
</P>
<P>
   This has stuck in Hutchins' craw. Lynn wasn't some gang member
or even a kid asking for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lynn didn't have a whole lot going for him economically, but
it sounded like he was working at school and working at baseball,''
he says. ``It could have been his ticket out of that.'' &QL; 
 &UR; The prosecutor
</P>
<P>
   Gaye Cochran, a deputy county attorney, pressed for a charge of
aggravated assault and wanted the girl treated as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the case was there,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The girl knew where the gun was kept. She had shown it off
earlier in the day. She was apparently upset about not getting the
CD.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom line, even if she only wanted to threaten to use the
gun by pointing it and it discharged acci dentally, she bore a
responsibility when she picked the gun up,'' the prosecutor says.
</P>
<P>
   These cases shake her.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of cases are so hard to handle emotionally. I
mean, what a waste,'' Cochran says. ``A 14-year-old shooting a
14-year-old. They have their whole lives ahead of them.'' &QL; 
 &UR; The girl
</P>
<P>
   The girl and her family have since moved out of the trailer
park. Their telephone number is not listed.
</P>
<P>
   She registered for classes at South Mountain High on the same
day Lynn returned, and though Lynn has never spoken to her since
the shooting, his friends and neigh borhood kids have.
</P>
<P>
   One boy was invited to her 15th birthday party but decided not
to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might get shot,'' he says, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   The police never found the bullet, though neighborhood kids say
the girl's mother dug it out of the wall of the trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn has never seen it. &QL;

 &HT;    Leave it to Chance: Gwaltney's field goal wins the game
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Chance Gwaltney entered the 14th annual
Georgia-Florida High School All-Star Game without a college
scholarship. He hopes his performance Saturday night lands him one.
</P>
<P>
   Gwaltney kicked a 33-yard field goal with no time remaining to
lift Georgia to a 23-21 win over Florida at the Georgia Dome. His
48-yard punt with five minutes to play helped swing the field
position _ bad for Georgia most of the game _ into his team's
favor.
</P>
<P>
   Gwaltney, a graduate of Cairo High, plans to walk on at Florida
State this fall ``unless somebody comes up with a scholarship offer
for me. ... I hope this helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Buford High's Tim Wansley earned Most Valuable Player honors for
Georgia. The 5-foot-9, 175-pound Georgia signee played both
cornerback and wide receiver and finished as the game's leading
rusher with his only carry, a 69-yard touchdown run on a reverse.
Wansley also had the biggest catch of the game, an 18-yard
reception on third-and-6 at the Florida 45 that set up the
game-winning field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't just representing Georgia; I felt like I was
representing Class A,'' Wansley said, referring to Buford's
classification. ``I wanted to prove small-school guys could play,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The win was Georgia's second in a row and closes Florida's lead
in the series to 6-5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Marcus Johnson intercepted a pass and blocked an
extra point to earn MVP honors for Florida. Georgia Tech signee Joe
Burns carried the ball 17 times for 42 yards and scored on a 3-yard
run. Demetrick Moore, a Georgia Military signee from Ware County,
added 38 yards on 11 carries. Washington County graduate Terrence
Edwards was the game's leading receiver with 79 yards, including a
70-yard TD catch. Georgia trailed 21-20 with 2:56 to play when it
took over at the Florida 49. Two runs netted just four yards. On
third down, Regan Torbert was under heavy pressure and unloaded a
short pass to Wansley, who cut off his deep route and turned it
into an 18-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
   Two Moore runs resulted in another first down at the Florida 13
and gave Georgia coach Rodney Walker a chance to play for the
winning field goal. Two runs at right tackle left Gwaltney with a
33-yard attempt from the right hash mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been kicking real well from the right wide all week, so
I asked coach to put it on the right hash,'' Gwaltney said. ``I
knew as soon as I hit it it was good.''

A FUND-RAISER SAYS DEMOCRATS ASKED FOR CASH  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Johnny Chung, a former fund-raiser for the
Democrats turned federal witness, has named several Democratic
Party officials whose aggressive encouragement, his lawyer says,
may have caused him to step over the line.
</P>
<P>
   Chung has given detailed briefings about his conversations with
party officials to federal investigators, his lawyer, Brian A. Sun,
confirmed in an interview. Sun did not say who the officials were.
</P>
<P>
   Chung had previously given federal investigators what
Republicans said was the first hard evidence that China had planned
to influence the 1996 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   As top Democrats accused Chung of betraying their trust, by
apparently acting as a conduit for illegal foreign money into the
party's coffers, Sun offered a stiff retort.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Democratic fund-raisers are suggesting that they were
innocent victims is belied by the fact they consistently and
aggressively held out their hands for donations, and encouraged
Chung to donate in exchange for introductions and photo
opportunities,'' Sun said in a telephone interview on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Democratic National Committee officials had suspicions
about Chung as early as March 1995, but that never stopped
Democrats and White House officials from soliciting money from him
in the run-up to the 1996 elections, according to depositions and
Senate investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The worst fears of top Democrats materialized last month when it
was revealed that Chung had told federal investigators he funneled
nearly $100,000 from a Chinese military officer to the Democrats in
1996. Chung gave the Democrats a total of $366,000, which was
returned after questions about the money.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Chung, a southern California businessman, pleaded
guilty to charges of campaign-related bank and tax fraud, and he is
to be sentenced on July 20. He is cooperating with the Justice
Department's campaign-finance inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Peter J. Kadzik, a lawyer for the Democratic committee, said
accusations by Chung against party fund-raisers were baseless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DNC, of course, did not have access to his bank records,''
Kadzik said, ``and a check of his background would have shown only
that he was a successful businessman with many Republican and
Democratic clients.''
</P>
<P>
   It did not take Chung long to go from bigwig to pariah within
Democratic fund-raising circles.
</P>
<P>
   From the back of his taxicab one morning in 1996, the Democratic
National Committee chairman, Donald L. Fowler, saw Chung standing
on the doorstep of the committee headquarters near Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my driver to put it into reverse immediately,'' Fowler
has told friends.

PANEL CALLS FOR PROBE  OF BABBITT IN CASINO DENIAL
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By C. HERMANEX  
 c.Special to The Arizona Republic  
C. Hermanex is a Chandler resi dent who originally wrote of her ex
periences as a victim of domestic violence for her church
newsletter. This is an edited version of her ac count that Hermanex
agreed to share with Republic readers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It could happen to someone you know.
</P>
<P>
   It is happening to someone as you read this.
</P>
<P>
   It happened to me.
</P>
<P>
   Government statistics say domes tic violence is underreported by
10 to 1. Having experienced more than 40 physical assaults, with
only four resulting in arrest and conviction of the batterer, I
guess I fit the statistic.
</P>
<P>
   But I am not a statistic. I am a woman, with a name, a life, a
family. Please remember that be yond statistics are real people _
somebody's mother, daughter, sister and friend.
</P>
<P>
   In domestic violence, abuses oc cur mainly in private. Good
people do not seem to be able to compre hend that a man is abusing
his wife and family.
</P>
<P>
   But that also seems to be the case even when the abuses are
witnessed. While I was separated from my husband, he learned I had
gone to church without him. He demanded to know who I sat next to,
who were the men there.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't answer, and he began pulling me into the car, twisting
my hair around his fists, pulling and pushing me back and forth
over the 18-month-old sitting on the seat next to him who, of
course, began to scream.
</P>
<P>
   My head was slammed into the door frame, my leg bruised by my
trying to use it to brace myself. In the blur of it all, I managed
to get the baby out of the car and into the house before the abuser
sped off.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors outside had witnessed the assault _ in daylight, on an
average neighborhood street. No one intervened. I had to call the
police myself. He received another ``pro bation and counseling''
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   People pass off domestic violence as the responsibility of the
system. But the justice system did not stop the assaults against
me. This time _ a third assault conviction _ the abuser was allowed
to avoid the court order to attend treatment. I came to realize
there exists what I've come to call the chain of discretion.
</P>
<P>
   At any point in this chain _ the police officer, then the
prosecutor, then the judge _ an abuser is likely to talk his way
out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the women I've known whose abusers were arrested and
prosecuted, I have never known a judge to impose a maximum sen
tence.
</P>
<P>
   Another way society avoids con fronting domestic violence is by
assuming that a victim can ``just'' go to a domestic violence
shelter. Having twice stayed in shelters, I know that this is not
an easy choice.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine trying to regain nor malcy while living in an unfamiliar
place in close quarters with people you don't know. The intimacies
of life's private tragedies are lived out in full view of one
another; children disoriented, the hourly tensions, the crying.
</P>
<P>
   There is crying every day in a DV shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, little regard is being given to the batterer's
behavior. There is still a stigma upon women who ``end up'' in DV
shelters. Keep in mind that a shelter is an institution _ and
``normal,'' capa ble people don't live in institutions.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder: Why aren't the abusers the ones in institutions?
</P>
<P>
   People also often ask, ``Why don't women leave?'' I did leave.
And when the relative I was staying with sold the house, I had the
choice to go back to living with the abuser or to enter another
shelter. I chose the shelter, and still it took two weeks to find
an opening for me and my children.
</P>
<P>
   This second shelter experience in 1995 offered the guarantee of
at least the basic necessities of life _ for 30 days that came and
went too soon.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no rest there. My now-2-year-old had developed kid
ney disease. Her fever was high and she was swollen head to toe. I
had to take her to the hospital immedi ately, after midnight and
with a groggy 8-year-old old in tow. My old vehicle by now had two
gears left, no air-conditioning, and over heated every seven miles
like clock work.
</P>
<P>
   It finally gave out on one of these runs to the clinic _ a day
I'll never forget.
</P>
<P>
   It was July, the height of the summer heat, with a feverish baby
and a confused 8-year-old. And when it broke down that day, I
suppose I did, too _ tears rolling down my face, unable to move,
car horns blaring at me, drivers cursing at me, my children looking
scared _ I gave up in the middle of Alma School Road.
</P>
<P>
   I had three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   With one I called the clinic to say the baby would be late.
Another I gave to my 8-year-old, hoping it would make her feel
better. The other I used to call my ex.
</P>
<P>
   I asked if he'd give us a ride. He said no. ``This is your
punishment, this is what you get.''
</P>
<P>
   I spent my time in the shelter trying to connect with community
resources, housing programs, social services.
</P>
<P>
   I spent hours on the phone or in transit to appointments,
filling out form after form, existing in waiting rooms with hungry,
restless chil dren.
</P>
<P>
   I found long waiting lists, limited funds, no housing subsidy
available for six months to a year.
</P>
<P>
   When my time was up at the shelter after 30 days, I had nowhere
to go, no provisions, no working vehicle, no housing and $270 a
month on which to survive with two children.
</P>
<P>
   Society seemed to disregard that I didn't get to be a battered
woman by choice.
</P>
<P>
   I was shuffled off as somebody else's responsibility, as a case
for ``professionals'' and ``charity or ganizations.''
</P>
<P>
   This response from the commu nity was only another setback for
me, as it is for any abused women whose first need is to make sense
of the confusion inherent in having been manipulated, beaten down
and blamed by an abuser whom the majority of society seems to
affirm as ``a nice guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The isolation that began with my abuser was now completed by the
community.
</P>
<P>
   I felt awkward, undeserving and self-conscious among the
married, the housed, the fed, the insured, the secure.
</P>
<P>
   A friend offered to let me and the children stay with her for a
week. When the week was up, she gave me enough money for a U-haul
truck to put my few belongings in storage.
</P>
<P>
   Even the U-haul was used as a sleeping place for myself and the
children for a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   I went from friend to friend, each for a different night or
couple of days. Even my mother-in-law re sponded to the need for my
children and I to have food and rest. I spent those days feeling
weak and slept most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   One morning I awoke and the abuser was leaning over me and the
sleeping children. I was scared. He said, ``You and the kids are
coming home with me, right?''
</P>
<P>
   I'd exhausted all other options. All I could think of was
waiting for the housing subsidy I'd applied for to come through,
and prayed it wouldn't be long.
</P>
<P>
   Only four days back with him, I was hit in the face while trying
to leave. There was no phone in the house; he watched my every
move, monitored my pager and forbade me to associate with neighbors
unless he was there.
</P>
<P>
   When he found out I'd gone to a neighbor's to use the phone, he
shut me in a room, pushed me into a corner and insisted we were
going to ``talk'' about my ``conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   I endured in the home of the abuser for a few more months.
</P>
<P>
   Our 2-year-old's condition was by then manageable and she was
recov ering. I was now pregnant again. Thoughts of having a place
of my own kept me as sane as I could manage given the abuser's
daily barrage of insults, demands and abuse.
</P>
<P>
   I left yet again, spending my days at libraries and bookstores,
even sometimes at the airport, seeking air-conditioned places where
people loitering didn't attract attention.
</P>
<P>
   I spent nights sleeping with the children in the back of my
vehicle, at times for nights in a row parked in a grocery store
lot.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle kept breaking down; my 8-year-old was unable to get
to school, sometimes for a whole week. I could see the hardship
weighing heavily on my children. Their beautiful little eyes so
deserv ing to be full of life held only sad confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Two long months.
</P>
<P>
   Hours of endless phone calls made from the corner pay phone, the
sound of cars and trucks drowning out whatever helpful mes sage I
might be lucky enough to connect with. I had to be on guard that
the children didn't run into the street while my attention was on a
pen and paper.
</P>
<P>
   I spent those days on bus benches, building my life around the
goal of getting my daughter to school for her free lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Some days I stretched the bus fare by walking a few miles,
saving enough to buy a jar of apple sauce, a little something for
the unborn child.
</P>
<P>
   Would I have energy left to walk the children to the food bank
or the soup kitchen later? Have change for the bus back, maybe?
</P>
<P>
   Most times I didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, as I write, there is a surreal quality to it all, as
if the only way I could cope was to allow myself to feel like it
happened to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   That could not have been me _ a mother, daughter, sister,
neighbor, friend!
</P>
<P>
   Today, two years after the loss of my son to stillbirth, I have
survived to carry his spirit with me. I know I will never be the
same. I am a realist now.
</P>
<P>
   My senses are heightened _ of danger, of deception, of survival.
And also heightened is my sense of self, my sense of being a child
of God, and the true sanctity of life as God intended.
</P>
<P>
   I know that with continued safety provided to victims, freeing
them to speak out in ways that enlighten others, the experiences of
battered women can and will be different.
</P>
<P>
   With increased awareness, the old myths will fall away, allowing
us all a chance to better the quality of life for abuse survivors
and their fami lies, for those who care about them, and for
ourselves as a community and as a people _ children of God all of
us.
</P>
<P>
   Believe me. &QL;

Maggert haunted by 3-putts
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JAYNE CUSTRED &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ It was the putter that betrayed Jeff Maggert on
Saturday during the third round of the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Three three-putts for bogeys on the treacherous Olympic Club
Lake Course tract was the difference between a very acceptable
2-over-par round of 72 and Maggert's disappointing 75. It also was
the difference between trailing leader Payne Stewart by three shots
or the six that Maggert will face going in today's final round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those three putts were the icing on the cake,'' Maggert said.
``Today was more putting than anything else. Those three were the
key holes for the round. Under conditions like these, you've got to
two-putt those holes. You can't give shots away like that.''
</P>
<P>
   And still expect to win the U.S. Open Golf Championship. That
was what was most discouraging of all. Maggert has finished fourth
in the Open in two of the last four years, and his back-to-back 69s
in the first two rounds of this tournament had put him in a great
position to finally get his first major victory.
</P>
<P>
   Now he faces an uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take perfect golf tomorrow,'' Maggert said. ``So far,
4 under has been the low round this week. I'll probably need 5
under to have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Maggert's day ended up even more frustrating because he started
out so well. He opened with a birdie that helped him stay close to
playing partner Stewart, who made eagle on No. 1. Even the bogey 4
on No. 3 and the double-bogey 6 on No. 5 weren't too devastating
because Stewart had stumbled as well and there was plenty of golf
to be played.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turning point was No. 9,'' Maggert said. ``I drove it into
the light rough, and I had a good lie. I hit the front edge of the
green, on the fringe, and three-putted for bogey. Then I
three-putted for bogey on Nos. 11 and 12. And all of those were bad
first putts. They were all about 10-footers for par.''
</P>
<P>
   Maggert did manage to sink a nice 12-footer for birdie on No. 16
that got him back to 2 over for the tournament But the 17th hole
dealt him what might have been the fatal blow. Maggert hit what he
thought was a solid approach shot to the green, only to have the
ball catch the edge of the heavy greenside rough. He recovered with
a nice chip to within five feet but missed the par putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one I really needed to get in,'' Maggert said. ``But
that's the way it was today. Sometimes the ball doesn't do what you
want. I didn't feel like I struck the ball too poorly. I drove the
ball OK. It seemed like I'd get awkward bounces _ one or two feet
in one direction when I needed them to go in the other direction.''
</P>
<P>
   That has been the case too often for Maggert, who has 11
second-place finishes on tour. He has a solid record in major
championships _ in 22 major appearances since 1992, he has finished
in the top 10 eight times. But he still is seeking that big
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Maggert came close last year. He spent a good portion of the
final round locked in a battle for the title with eventual champion
Ernie Els, Tom Lehman and Colin Montgomerie. But a couple of bogeys
midway through the day forced him to play aggressively. And he
closed with back-to-back double bogeys and finished fourth.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Maggert was hoping for the chance to redeem himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought my game was good for the Open,'' Maggert
said. ``I think you learn it is the patience that you have to learn
to play the Open well. I think that is what I have done well the
last four, five years. This is not a golf tournament where you are
going to go out and expect to shoot 65s and 64s.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Maggert, that is so true. And it's unlikely
Maggert will be able to change that today. But he still intends to
try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to get off to a good start,'' Maggert said. ``If I can
get a couple under on the front nine If I'm back to even par at the
turn, I've got a chance. Payne's in a tough position. He knows he
needs another round like today.''
</P>
<P>
   But Maggert needs even more than that. The Olympic Club is one
of the most difficult courses the pros have faced in recent years.
Even Maggert was surprised at what the course threw at the golfers
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough,'' Maggert said. ``I needed some good breaks, and
I just didn't get many. I was really trying to have fun. I kept my
head in it well. But 75 was just the best I could have done today.
I played and played and played, and that's just how many shots it
took.''
</P>
<P>
   Too many shots one more year.

A WILD VAN POPPEL LOSES RANGERS DEBUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Right-hander Todd Van Poppel and left-hander
Matt Perisho yesterday received an ultimatum from Rangers manager
Johnny Oates.
</P>
<P>
   Produce or perish.
</P>
<P>
   Van Poppel, whom the Rangers purchased from Triple-A Oklahoma
before yesterday's game at Edison International Field of Anaheim,
could not record an out during the third inning before being
removed by Oates in the Angels' 8-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Perisho, whom the Rangers recalled Tuesday from Triple-A
Oklahoma, registered only seven outs during his start Tuesday in a
9-7 loss to the Oakland Athletics at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call two guys up, and they don't go five innings between
them,'' Oates said. ``If that's pressure on them, I'm sorry. We owe
it to our fans to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Poppel delivered few strikes during his 75-pitch appearance,
but the first one he threw _ actually, his first pitch to Angels
leadoff hitter Darin Erstad _ glanced off the right-field foul pole
after leaving the first baseman's bat.
</P>
<P>
   Van Poppel, who surrendered five runs on four hits, issued five
walks. Consecutive third-inning walks to catcher Phil Nevin and
left fielder Orlando Palmeiro brought Oates from his perch in the
dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we saw today is unacceptable at the major-league level,''
Oates said. ``Actually, it's unacceptable at any level.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers supported Van Poppel with three runs before the
right-hander took the mound for his first major-league appearance
since Sept. 27, 1996. Left fielder Rusty Greer delivered a one-out,
run-scoring single, and a two-run home run from right fielder Juan
Gonzalez two pitches later gave the Rangers a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Van Poppel, though, hit third baseman Dave Hollins with a 3-2
pitch after Erstad's home run. Center fielder Jim Edmonds, the next
hitter, lined a single through the middle on a 3-1 pitch. Hollins
eventually scored on a ground ball by designated hitter Tim Salmon,
and Van Poppel then issued a four-pitch walk to right fielder
Garret Anderson. A two-out, run-scoring single by Palmeiro also
occurred on a three-ball count.
</P>
<P>
   Van Poppel threw pitches high, low, wide and inside, and a few
of those went in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't even `just missing,''' Oates said. ``It was a
struggle, and I don't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did Van Poppel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had a game like that all year,'' said Van Poppel,
who issued only 2.59 walks per nine innings during 15 appearances
(13 starts) with the Triple-A RedHawks. ``I know I'm a better
pitcher than that, so I'm not going to let one start get to me. I
feel good about myself, and I'm just going to chalk this one up and
go on to my next start.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels right-hander Steve Sparks, whom the Angels purchased
Monday from Triple-A Vancouver of the Pacific Coast League, beat
the Rangers for the second time in six days after going 0-8 during
11 minor-league starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks, who relies on his knuckleball, allowed only three hits
and three walks during the next 5 1/3 innings after a shaky first
frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a chance to win when the offense is down,''
Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Oates conveyed that thought more diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to win with three starters,'' Oates said. ``You can
be competitive with three, but it's tough to win.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether Van Poppel will receive an
opportunity to start Thursday's game at Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't make all your decisions based on one appearance,''
Oates said. ``I will say we have to get better _ regardless of who
it is.'' \Ntagtop:Johnny Paul, (817) 390-7760
\Ntagbottom:''jpaul\Nstar-telegram.com''
Bad start Rangers starter Todd Van Poppel's first major-league
appearance since 1996 isn't one he'll want to remember: Innings
pitched: 2-plus Pitches: 75 Balls: 41 Strikes: 34 Batters faced: 16
Batters who reached base: 10 Runs allowed: 5

STARR IS SAID TO BE INSISTENT ABOUT A GUILTY PLEA FROM LEWINSKY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawyers for Monica Lewinsky have been told that she
must agree to plead guilty to some offense to reach an agreement
with Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who is investigating
her relationship with President Clinton, said a person with
knowledge of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's new legal team is pressing Starr to grant her
full immunity from prosecution in exchange for her testimony, in
which the former White House intern would acknowledge a sexual
relationship with the president, said the person, who insisted on
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But in early talks with her lawyers, the person said, Starr has
insisted that he would end the criminal investigation of Ms.
Lewinsky only if she would agree to a guilty plea. It was unclear
if she would be required to plead guilty to a misdemeanor or
felony, and what sort of punishment might be imposed on her as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   Details about the negotiations between Starr and Ms. Lewinsky's
new legal team, Plato Cacheris and Jacob Stein, were first reported
on Saturday in The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear whether Cacheris and Stein,
prominent Washington lawyers who were hired by Ms. Lewinsky's
family early this month, had been able to obtain a deal for their
client that was any better than the one that had been offered by
Starr to her previous lawyer, William Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Any statement by Ms. Lewinsky that she had sex with the
president would be a problem for Clinton, who has said in a sworn
deposition that he had never had a sexual relationship with the
former intern.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News and World Report said on Saturday that one of its
editors had been allowed to listen to two hours of previously
undisclosed recordings of Ms. Lewinsky and that she was infatuated
with Clinton, although the tapes are ambiguous about whether there
was a physical relationship between the president and the former
White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I looked in his eyes, I saw something I didn't
expect to see,'' Ms. Lewinsky said on the tapes, according to the
report in the new edition of magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine said that an associate editor, Elise Ackerman, was
allowed to listen to the tapes, which were made last October, under
an agreement in which she was not allowed to make a copy, nor take
notes while she was listening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our judgment that the source had no ideological or
commercial motivation to favor the president, the independent
counsel, or any other party in the dispute,'' the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the tapes were among those made by
Linda Tripp, the former Pentagon employee who turned her tapes of
Ms. Lewinsky over to Starr, who is trying to determine if Clinton
or others sought to coerce Ms. Lewinsky into lying.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that the tapes showed that Ms. Tripp seemed at
times to be egging Ms. Lewinsky on to produce graphic recollections
of her visits with Clinton. ''But Lewinsky seems oblivious,'' the
report said of the former intern, who was then employed at the
Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has fallen in love with the president and is determined to
obtain a transfer to a White House job.''

STEWART BUILDS OPEN LEAD TO FOUR STROKES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On one side of the equation is Payne Stewart,
the wire-to-wire leader at the U.S. Open whose four-stroke
advantage represents the largest third-round margin at the event
since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Tony Jacklin went on to win the Open by seven
strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, Stewart is also playing at the Olympic Club, where
no third-round leader has gone on to win the Open in three previous
visits to the course.
</P>
<P>
   So, which trend gets broken today?
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, an SMU graduate who fashioned a third-round 70 to
remain the only player under par through three rounds (3 under),
said yesterday that he likes his chances to close out his
competitors for the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I think that I've played these first three rounds using
smoke and mirrors, I'm kidding myself,'' Stewart said. ``I've
played good golf. If I come out and play the way Payne Stewart can
play, I'll win the golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I come out and let the situation intimidate me, then that's
my own fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart showed few signs of backing up during the third round
yesterday, opening with an eagle and building his lead to four
strokes by the time he reached the sixth tee box. Stewart, who led
by a single stroke after each of the first two rounds, did not let
the cushion dip below four stokes the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   He will carry that four-shot advantage into the final pairing
with Tom Lehman, who sat on the 54-hole lead at the past three
Opens but did not win any. Also trailing Stewart by four strokes is
Bob Tway (1 over), with Nick Price and Lee Janzen, both at 2 over,
the only other players within five strokes of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Members of that five-player group have combined to win eight
major championships, with each owning at least one major title and
only Price (three) having more than two. Suffice to say, it is a
far more elite list of pursuers that awaits Stewart today than the
cast of characters who dropped off the pace yesterday, when PGA
Tour journeymen Jeff Maggert (75) and Lee Porter (75) joined U.S.
Amateur champ Matt Kuchar (76) as fallen contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Stewart, winner of the 1991 Open and the 1989 PGA
Championship, insists that he is undaunted by the history of
Olympic, which has seen golfing giants Ben Hogan (1955), Arnold
Palmer (1966) and Tom Watson (1987) reeled in by less-heralded
players in come-from-behind fashion in the final round.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wasn't nervous, then something would be wrong with me,''
said Stewart, who did not three-putt while padding his lead despite
hitting just seven of 14 fairways and 10 of 18 greens in
regulation. ``But I'm playing good golf. I've been here before.
I've been a champion and there's no reason I can't be a champion
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart took control of his destiny by reaching the green at the
par-5 first hole in two shots, then dropping a 15-foot eagle putt.
In three rounds, Stewart is 4 under at No. 1 and 1 over for the
rest of the course.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart made one birdie the rest of the way, a tap-in at No. 8
but limited himself to three bogeys after taking five in his second
round. Although Price said Stewart will be ``difficult to catch if
he's hitting the ball solidly,'' other pursuers were not as willing
to buy into Stewart's post-round bravado.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was in Payne's position and had a four-shot lead, I
wouldn't feel safe,'' said Tway, who found just five of 14 fairways
during a round of 73.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Lehman, who rallied with a third-round 68, willing to
concede the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get pretty nervous with the lead on this course. When
you're really nervous, those fairways look like they're an inch
wide because of all the slope on them,'' said Lehman, who
characterized Olympic's history of producing comeback winners at
the Open as ``encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, all agree, will depend on whether Stewart opens
the door for those in his rearview mirror. Through three rounds, he
has three-putted one green. His nine bogeys are the fewest of any
player on the leader board.
</P>
<P>
   He has the chance, on Father's Day, to finish a quest that
started with his late father, Bill, in the 1955 Open at Olympic.
Bill Stewart, a club pro from Springfield, Mo., missed the cut in
that event by shooting 83-88. His son, Payne, has a chance to win
on the same course 43 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart reflected yesterday on what advice his father would have
given him heading into the final round.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd say, `Just go out and keep doing what you're doing. Keep
it on the greens and keep your head still when you putt,' ''
Stewart said. ``That's what I plan to do.''
</P>
<P>
   If he does, Stewart may hoist his second U.S. Open trophy by
nightfall.

WATCH SELLS AT AUCTION FOR RECORD $1.1 MILLION  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Time, as they say, is money. The question on Saturday
was, How much?
</P>
<P>
   At the Antiquorum auction of important timepieces in midtown
Manhattan, the answer was a record-breaking $1.1 million, for a
yellow gold Patek Philippe wristwatch with perpetual calendar and
moon phases. Only three of its kind were made. It was believed to
be the highest price ever paid for a watch in the United States.
The previous record was $786,000, for a Patek Philippe sold by
Christie's in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The watch sold on Saturday, to an unnamed American collector,
was among a dazzling inventory that included a Patek Philippe
wristwatch that had belonged to the jazz great Duke Ellington.
</P>
<P>
   Ellington bought his waterproof watch, yellow gold with a round
button split-second chronograph, in Geneva on July 28, 1948. An
unnamed German collector bought it on Saturday for $673,500. Its
value, prior to the auction, had been estimated at $150,000 to
$180,000.
</P>
<P>
   The auction was the second held this year in New York City by
Antiquorum, an auction house based in Geneva that sells fine
timepieces around the world, and it comes at a time when luxury
watch sales are booming. Manhattan dealers report brisk sales of
new watches in the $25,000 to $75,000 range.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the young tycoons snapping up Rolexes, Breguets, and
newer Patek Philippes, the buyers on Saturday were keen-eyed
collectors, aficionados of horology, the 500-year-old artful
science of building devices that measure time.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily, they are motivated by two things: quality and rarity,
said Osvaldo Patrizzi, the chairman of Antiquorum.
</P>
<P>
   There were many famous brand names on the auction block,
including Rolex and Movado, but those made by Patek Philippe,
founded in Switzerland in 1839 and known for its sophisticated
workmanship, attracted the most attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patek is the watch that is most in the heart of the
collector,'' Patrizzi said. ``It's one of the three or four best
manufacturers in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The same German collector who bought the Ellington watch also
bought a Patek Philippe World Time wristwatch, in pink gold with
fancy hands and a revolving ring dial bearing the names of 41
cities, for $662,500. Total sales at the auction were $5.55
million.
