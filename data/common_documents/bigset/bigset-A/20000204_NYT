MORE LAW FIRMS OFFER RAISES TO STEM BRAIN DRAIN TO DOT-COMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<P>
   The frenzy over law firm salaries reached new heights Thursday
and spread for the first time to a law firm based in neither New
York nor Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the nation's largest law firm, Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom in New York, sent memos to associates
Thursday telling them they would receive raises of about 40
percent. First-year associates will now make $140,000 a year in
base salary, about $15,000 more than they will at other firms that
announced large raises in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The big increases are the latest sign of the widespread effect
that the Internet is having on highly skilled workers in a range of
professions. Silicon Valley law firms started the bidding war over
the last month and a half to keep their younger lawyers from
defecting to dot-com start-ups, and other firms have reacted to
keep pace with the salaries of the California firms, many of which
have offices on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of young lawyers, already among the highest paid
workers in the country, are getting raises that usually go only to
people who receive promotions or who switch jobs. And almost
overnight, the nation's largest law firms have added as much as $50
million to their individual payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a lot of money,'' said Benjamin F. Stapleton, a partner
at Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell in New York, which announced raises
Wednesday. The moves by Skadden and Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell virtually
ensure that every other top firm in New York will offer similarly
large pay increases in the coming weeks, lawyers said. Davis Polk &AMP;
Wardwell, which told its associates last week that their salaries
would jump by about 25 percent, was the first New York firm to act.
</P>
<P>
   Skadden's decision will also put pressure on its rivals to hand
out large end-of-year bonuses to bring associates' total pay
packages to about the same level as those at Skadden. Because
Skadden will pay relatively small bonuses, its partners do not
consider the raise to be an attempt to top the other firms'
salaries, said Robert C. Sheehan, the firm's executive partner.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based Testa, Hurwitz &AMP; Thibeault told its associates
Thursday that they, too, would receive raises of as much as 40
percent. Recent law school graduates will now earn $140,000 in a
city with real estate costs that are well below those in New York
or San Francisco. Sixth-year associates at Testa will make $205,000
this year. Lawyers in Boston typically work many fewer hours than
those in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Testa will not offer bonuses of any kind, said Timothy C.
Maguire, a partner. All 330 of Testa's lawyers work in Boston, and
Maguire said he expected Testa's rivals, like Hale &AMP; Dorr and Ropes
&AMP; Gray, to offer similar raises soon.
</P>
<P>
   The new salaries indicate just how much law firms have profited
from the long economic expansion, the current wave of mergers and
initial public offerings, and the growth in litigation over the
last decade. In addition to announcing the raises, Testa's memo to
associates said it hoped they would curtail the long hours they
have recently logged and improve their quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, Maguire said, the firm would have an easier
time hiring more talented lawyers and bringing in more clients.
``We're turning away an awful lot of work,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The East Coast firms have avoided the strategy of most Silicon
Valley firms, which have tied bonuses _ as much as $30,000 for
first-year associates _ to the number of hours that a lawyer bills.
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of raises brought glee to associates around the
country, many of whom keep each other apprised of the announcements
through e-mail and postings on a Yahoo Web site called Greedy
Associates. One participant posted a poem Thursday afternoon
praising Skadden. Its last lines were: ``Arps! The Skadden Angels
sing! Glory to the Salary King . . .''

MEMORIALS HELD FOR VICTIMS OF ALASKA AIRLINES CRASH 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   POINT MUGU, Calif. _ Many had come to California with
desperately high hopes that their loved ones might yet be saved.
But the hope faded quickly, and Thursday the families of those
killed in the crash Alaska Airline Flight 261 confronted the sea
that still keeps their loved ones from them.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 of the victims' relatives visited the site of the
crash, looking out at fog-shrouded islands from the private,
6-mile-long beach at Point Mugu Naval Air Station.
</P>
<P>
   They spent more than two hours there, reaching out to touch the
water, building sandcastles, writing the names of their loved ones
with seaweed, or simply scratching ``Good-bye,'' in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   They stuck roses in the beach, or just cast them into the water.
</P>
<P>
   Some huddled together in groups, others wandered off by
themselves. Some shed some of their clothing and went in the water,
seeming to want to get closer to those they lost. Nearly all broke
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water in the ocean was just a symbol of the tears that
were shed,'' said Doris Lance, a Navy spokeswoman. ``It's hard to
describe. It was extremely moving.''
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, the day was routine at times, like it used to be, a
less frenetic pace for Alaska Airline employees who had operated on
instinct and adrenaline for three days.
</P>
<P>
   Waves of grief had filtered in, then faded Thursday as they
worked. One minute, ticket agents were busy processing passengers,
issuing boarding passes, checking bags. The next, they were
silently huddled behind the counter, 25 teary-eyed colleagues
remembering 88 friends and customers who died Monday.
</P>
<P>
   They wore tiny blue ribbons on their lapels, symbolizing the
sea, they said. They worked surrounded by flower arrangements on
the Alaska and Horizon ticket counters. At 4:35 p.m., they bowed
their heads as the loudspeaker announced 30 seconds of silence to
remember those who perished exactly three days earlier when Flight
261 went down.
</P>
<P>
   Two pilots. Three flight attendants. Seven employees of Alaska
Airlines and Horizon Air. Seventy-six customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were our mothers, our fathers, our sons and daughters,
our brothers and sisters, our children and our family,'' the
announcement said. ``We will miss them all very much.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the coming weeks,'' the announcement said, ``please take
the time to look into the eyes of our Eskimo and remember those we
have lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, for 30 seconds, Sea-Tac International Airport went silent.
</P>
<P>
   For many relatives of those killed in the crash, Thursday marked
their first view of the area where their loved ones lived their
last moments.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few days, some have come in small groups to see it
for themselves; a handful have taken boats out to the site, a few
miles offshore, where Navy Coast Guard vessels continue to try and
recover the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   For most, the rocks or pieces of driftwood or handfuls of sand
they grab might be all they have to remember their loved ones. Only
four bodies of the 88 people killed in the crash have been
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The Ventura County coroner's office said Thursday more than 200
partial human remains have been recovered, but only a few can be
identified through clothing, jewelry, dental records and other
markings, such as tattoos. The rest can only be identified through
DNA and other laboratory tests, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Not having a body to bury, a grave site to visit, ``just adds to
the depth of the loss,'' said Marty Moscrip, one of the American
Red Cross' grief counselors helping the relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The families will have another chance to remember their loved
ones tomorrow, when the Red Cross sponsors a private memorial
service at Pepperdine University.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 families are staying at a hotel near the Los
Angeles Airport, where they are receiving support from the Red
Cross, Alaska Airlines and the National Transportation Safety
Board.
</P>
<P>
   They left the hotel late Thursday morning, under cloudless
skies. Some clutched bouquets of plump red roses and wore
expressions of exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   They arrived at Point Mugu 90 minutes later, six buses and 35
cars and vans, accompanied by a police escort, rolling through the
Navy base gates with their lights on, as in a funeral cortege.
</P>
<P>
   As they got off the bus, they were handed flowers _ daisies,
roses, lilies. Some held bouquets, others single flowers, as they
walked toward the water's edge, said Lance, the Navy spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   A Coast Guard honor guard, holding a large wicker basket, filed
past the relatives slowly. Each placed their flowers inside, until
it brimmed.
</P>
<P>
   The basket was loaded into the helicopter, which left the base,
banked south over the ocean then returned to the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping to about 100 feet, allowing the flowers to be seen
through the open hatch, it moved quietly, slowly over the families,
then banked again and headed west to the horizon, where it
scattered the flowers over the crash site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a rough day for everyone,'' said Dr. Robert Scott, one
of the grief counselors who accompanied the families Thursday. ``It
brought home the reality, and when the reality is brought home, it
releases all of the emotion and grief.''
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy, meanwhile, continues to touch the community here.
Thursday night, hundreds came out to the city pier in Port Hueneme
to participate in a candle-light vigil of prayer and song.
</P>
<P>
   Holding their children, wiping away tears, they walked out the
end of the pier, which juts about 1,000 feet into the ocean, and
released balloons and cast flowers into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the vigil said they will raise money to put up a
monument to the crash victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comfort means to `come along side,'' said Tracy Cook, pastor
of the Parkview Baptist Church. ``We may not be able to it
physically, but we can do it emotionally, coming along side and
comforting.''

FLIGHT RECORDERS CRITICAL IN INVESTIGATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the U.S. Navy launched its search for the most critical
clues to the cause of Flight 261's crash this week, they risked
finding the noises and not the data.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Navy salvage teams were frustrated, temporarily, in their
search for one of the flight's so-called black boxes _ the flight
data recorder _ because the box's water-activated homing beacon was
torn from the recorder. That kind of separation has occurred in
recent airline crashes, taking away a critical tool used by
searchers and delaying crash investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The separation of a recorder from its beacon, or ``pinger,''
poses a serious threat to a search team because it could add days
to their search, exposing them to increasing risks, said John
Nance, a Tacoma-based commercial airplane pilot and author. It also
boosts the cost of the operation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, it has not cost as much as it could easily cost in the
future,'' said Nance, who is currently on leave from Alaska
Airlines. ``They are not charging bargain basement prices for''
salvage ships and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   While federal regulators have beefed up the requirements
manufacturers must meet when they attach a beacon to a recorder,
airlines such as Alaska often use older versions.
</P>
<P>
   That's a point of concern for National Transportation Safety
Board Chairman Jim Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recorders involved in Alaska Airlines 261, EgyptAir 900,
TWA-800, ValuJet-Miami and several other accidents were built to an
earlier standard that did not have the pinger bolted to the crash
enclosure,'' Hall said Thursday. ``This permitted the pinger to
become detached from the recorder due to crash forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators are working on the problem. The Federal
Aviation Administration is discussing a plan to require two
comprehensive recorders on each plane, according to Ron Crotty, a
spokesman for Honeywell International Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Each unit would contain both a cockpit recorder and a data
recorder, Crotty said. Investigators would only need to recover one
of the boxes to retrieve all the data.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell isn't developing a model that would place the beacon
inside the recorder's shell, Crotty said. That's in part because
such a device would be more costly and difficult to maintain, Nance
said.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder is fed a steady stream of information
about the airplane's operations, from instrument readings to wing
flap positions, throughout the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the cockpit voice recorder collects the conversations
of the pilots and the noises in the cockpit. Together, the
mechanisms offer investigators a wealth of information.
</P>
<P>
   The black boxes, however, aren't black.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers, such as AlliedSignal of Seattle _ now owned by
Honeywell _ paint the recorders bright orange. Those markings make
the rectangular boxes easier to spot on the ocean floor or among
debris.
</P>
<P>
   The units are built to last. They are encased in a shell of
hardened steel and were likely stashed near the tail of the
airplane, according to Honeywell. The boxes are mounted at the rear
of the aircraft because that part of a crashed plane usually
remains intact.
</P>
<P>
   The units can survive roughly 1,000 times the force of gravity,
or 1,000 Gs, according to Honeywell's Crotty. By comparison, a car
generates approximately 300 Gs crashing into a wall.
</P>
<P>
   The data recorder was also designed to withstand heat of up to
1,100 degrees Celsius for as long as 30 minutes, Crotty said.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell's latest version of the recorder is even tougher,
capable of surviving, 3,400 Gs. Unlike the previous version, its
pingers are bolted onto the enclosure.

GORE TIES BRADLEY TO REAGAN-ERA ECONOMICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLYMPIA, Wash. _ In one his harshest attacks yet on Bill
Bradley, Vice President Al Gore on Thursday sought to identify his
Democratic presidential rival with the leadership style of Ronald
Reagan and inferred that Bradley is a disconnected dreamer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the presidency is an academic exercise,'' Gore
told a rally here. ``I don't think it's a seminar on some grand
theory.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has sought to depict himself as a technology-minded
``New Democrat'' on past visits to Washington, returned to
old-style politics here Thursday night. He delivered an arm-waving,
attack-filled speech to nearly 1,000 supporters, and a few
hecklers, at Garfield Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   Gore singled out the Democratic Party's interest groups, one by
one, for praise and promised them action on long-sought objectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``No organized force in America is more capable of
counterbalancing special interests than organized labor when it
comes to standing up for working men and women,'' Gore declared. He
said it is time ``to get rid of'' the hiring of replacement workers
for those on strike.
</P>
<P>
   Gore asked teachers in the audience for a show of hands. ``You
are heroes and I appreciate you very much,'' he said. He ticked off
a laundry list of promised programs from universal preschool to
college tuition subsidies for those who pledge to teach in
inner-city or rural schools.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also announced an endorsement from former
Gov. Mike Lowry, perhaps the state's most outspokenly liberal
politician. ``Mike is a great man and a great leader,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's visit came at the end of a hectic cross-country journey
that began in Manchester, N.H., Tuesday night with his narrow
victory over Bradley in the Granite State's first-in-the-nation
presidential primary. He has since been in New York, Washington,
D.C., Ohio and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's stop here was arranged last week when local
Gore supporters became worried at a recent Elway Poll that showed
rising support for Bradley in the state. Washington has a tradition
of supporting reform-minded insurgent Democratic presidential
candidates. In 1992, former Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas scored
a solid victory over Bill Clinton in the state's precinct caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Gore pulled out all the rhetorical stops Thursday night. The
vice president showed that his reputation as a tough political
infighter is not undeserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Bradley supported the slashing budget cuts President
Reagan proposed in 1981,'' Gore charged. He went on to say that
Bradley has voiced admiration for Reagan's style of leadership _
``just focusing on one big issue or a small group of issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The charge is certain to be viewed by the campaign of the former
New Jersey senator as a low blow. Gore's speech came too late
Thursday night for Bradley to respond. Bradley is due to campaign
in Seattle on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire appearances last week, Bradley argued for
universal health care, handgun registration and an end to childhood
poverty. ``You've got to do the big thing,'' he said. ``You can't
do the little thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The former New York Knicks forward identified himself as ``in
the tradition of Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson.'' He did
not mention Reagan. Bradley has on occasion listed World War I-era
President Woodrow Wilson as another leader worthy of emulation.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ridiculed the big objective, one-big-issue approach to the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the presidency is a day-by-day fight for real
people,'' he said. ``You've got to fight all the time. That's how
we made progress.''
</P>
<P>
   As Reagan and Vice President George Bush cut federal programs _
aided by some of Bradley's Senate votes _ ``look at what they
didn't allow to distract them,'' Gore said. ``They didn't seem to
notice that the national debt was quadrupling. They didn't notice
that the AIDS crisis was spiraling out of control. They didn't
notice that the real take-home pay for working families was
declining and that unemployment was rising.''
</P>
<P>
   By identifying Bradley with Reagan-era economics, Gore was also
putting one of his leading congressional friends on the spot. Rep.
Norm Dicks, D-Wash., a 24-year Gore buddy, also voted for Reagan's
1981 tax cut, the only Democrat from Washington to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's supporters cheered his words, and did not
think his attack on Bradley was unfair. ``If you don't point out
the differences, you aren't going to win,'' said State Lands
Commissioner Jennifer Belcher.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Rep. Jolene Unsoeld said Gore was right in his
buzzsaw criticism of Bradley. ``Good grief no: He didn't say
anything I don't agree with,'' said Unsoeld when asked if Gore's
jabs were excessive.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has made 13 trips to Washington since the 1996 election,
visiting places ranging from a flood-caused sinkhole in Shoreline
to the summit of Mount Rainier. Seattle was a stop on his
announcement tour for the presidency last June, and again in
October when Gore unveiled a less formal, more aggressive campaign
style.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement tour last June was disrupted by cries of
``Whale Killer!'' from a small group that demonized the Clinton
administration for not stopping the Makah Indians' whale hunt. The
anti-whaling protestors shouted their anger again Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gore found an applause line with which to respond to the
hecklers. ``Lets hear it for free speech! Lets hear it for the
First Amendment,'' he shouted back.
</P>
<P>
   Gore on Thursday night used the same approach toward the Clinton
presidency that he deployed in New Hampshire and Iowa. He
emphasized good economic times, and did not mention the themes of
political reform that have fueled the campaigns of Bradley and GOP
presidential hopeful Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on a roll,'' he said. ``We need to keep our prosperity
going. We have to see that nobody gets left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   He also targeted Republicans as supporters of ``a risky tax
scheme'' and enemies of the environment. ``All of them want to give
more power to the polluters,'' Gore said.

FED ACTIVITY NOT TIED TO ELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is the Federal Reserve bucking political tradition with its
relentless barrage of interest rate increases heading into the
election season?
</P>
<P>
   This week's rate hike was the fourth turn of the monetary screws
in seven months. Given the Fed's perceived inclination to avoid
appearances of manipulating economic conditions during politically
tender times, the central bank's recent behavior would seem at odds
with its persona.
</P>
<P>
   This is only partly so. Recent history, with a couple of
exceptions, shows a Fed that tends to make monetary moves
independent of the political cycle.
</P>
<P>
   For political partisans who view the Fed as a meddlesome party
pooper, however, the most vivid memory of its intrusive powers is
probably 1979-80. The irony of this period is that skyrocketing
market rates weren't the result of extraordinary boosts to key Fed
rates. Instead, they came from financial market reactions to
revamped Fed policy.
</P>
<P>
   An effort to subdue hyperinflation prompted the Fed to stop
making a target of interest rates and instead tighten the money
supply. The market's response was sky-high rates throughout the
economy. The prime rate, for example, shot from 11.5 percent in
mid-1979 to a peak of 21.5 percent in December 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Another irony of this experience was that President Jimmy Carter
appointed Paul Volcker as Fed chairman knowing full well that
Volcker's bid to control inflation would imperil prospects for a
second term. Carter's worst fears, of course, were realized when
Ronald Reagan won. Carter's political courage, it's worth noting,
paved the way for the prosperity Americans now take for granted.
Within three years, inflation had been tamed and the economy was on
its way to full recovery.
</P>
<P>
   An activist Fed moved just as dramatically in 1991-92, but in
the opposite direction. In the waning days of a short recession
that would end in early 1991, the Fed began trimming the discount
rate and federal funds rate. By September 1992, the discount rate
had dived from 6.5 percent to 3 percent, and the federal funds
target had plummeted from 6.75 percent to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This attempt to revive the economy didn't save George Bush's
presidency, though. Although the prime rate slid to 6 percent, its
lowest level since the early '60s, dispirited consumers still sat
on their money. The economy was expanding modestly, but nobody felt
good, and economic concerns helped Bill Clinton win. Eventually the
Fed's rate relief did revitalize the financial system and restore
investor confidence, which fueled the stock market boom and
rejuvenated the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But these two instances of Fed activism near elections are
notable as exceptions to the rule. A review of key rate moves since
1960 leads to the conclusion that the Fed's actions are mostly
responses dictated by economic developments rather than political
cycles.
</P>
<P>
   This time around may seem different, but an important
consideration for 2000 is the absence of a presidential incumbent.
No matter who wins the White House, neither victor nor vanquished
will be able to make a convincing case that the Fed significantly
influenced the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Given the economy's underlying strength, any sign of an
incipient reversal of fortune won't be much noticeable by November.

HEAVY USAGE CAUSES H&AMP;R BLOCK TO TEMPORARILY CLOSE ONLINE TAX SITE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ H&AMP;R Block Inc. said Thursday that it had to
shut down its new tax preparation Web site for home users earlier
this week after unexpectedly heavy usage overwhelmed its software.
</P>
<P>
   Design flaws in the methodology that protects users' privacy and
provides backups for their tax calculation were the primary causes
of the problem, said Gene S. Goldenberg, Block's senior vice
president for software and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that we've got them fixed, we're up and
running, and thousands are using the site as we speak,'' he said
Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The problem did not affect access to other tax and financial
services offered at Block's 3-week-old expanded Web site or any of
the tax preparation work at Block's approximately 9,000 U.S. tax
offices. Those tax returns are prepared and filed on a different
system.
</P>
<P>
   The new online tax preparation system, which is designed to
accommodate as many as 50,000 users at once, began to slow down
Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Block shut down the site early Wednesday and began downloading
free copies of its TaxCut software to users who wanted it while
technicians worked to restore the system, Goldenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   No one appears to have lost any tax data while the site was
down, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Block launched its expanded Web site for home users at
HRBlock.com Jan. 12 as part of a larger package of tax and
financial services offered both online and in the company's tax
service offices this filing season.
</P>
<P>
   About 230,000 people have visited the tax preparation site since
then. Block originally estimated that perhaps 650,000 would use the
site before federal and state income tax deadlines arrived.

NO PROBLEMS REPORTED BEFORE FATAL FLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXNARD, Calif. _ The pilots who flew the Alaska Airlines MD-83
jetliner on its last two legs from Seattle to Mexico before its
final fatal flight with a different crew did not report any
problems with the aircraft, the National Transportation Safety
Board said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both pilots reported the plane performed in a normal manner,''
safety board member John Hammerschmidt said at the end of a long,
productive day for investigators seeking clues about why Flight 261
tumbled out of the sky Monday afternoon, killing all 88 people
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   A remote-control underwater U.S. Navy submarine video-taped
wreckage of the plane's tail section, he said, in the same area
where the plane's ``black box'' recorders were pulled from the
water Thursday and Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   He said pieces of the jets' tail section, with the distinctive
Alaska Airlines Eskimo logo, are visible on the video, as are
portions of the horizontal stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
   The wreckage is in small pieces on the hard, sandy bottom, he
said. The biggest piece seen on the videotape is a section of outer
fuselage skin with four or five passenger windows, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the wreckage in that debris field is less than 3 feet in
size, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's horizontal stabilizer has become the central focus
of the investigation so far, as pilot Ted Thompson and first
officer Willim Tansky fought to control the plane, they discussed a
stabilizer problem with Alaska Airlines' maintenance base in
Seattle and with a company mechanic in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots reported that they had a ``runaway'' stabilizer,
Hammerschmidt said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The stabilizer is the wing-like stucture atop the MD-83s' tail.
It has a 40-foot span, and the front portion of the stabilizer can
be moved or ``trimmed'' several degrees up or down by the crew or
by the autopilot to counter the tendancy of the plane to pitch up
or down because of the aerodynamics of the wing. On a typical
commercial airline flight, as many as 70 or more trim changes may
be needed to keep the plane stable.
</P>
<P>
   A runaway stabilizer goes to either the full-up or full-down
position. The MD-83's crew reported the stabilizer jammed in the
down position, and asked how they could free it.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots asked if there were any ``hidden'' electrical circuit
breakers they could switch on and off _ the procedure for a runaway
stabilizer calls for the crew to pull circuit breakers for the
primary and alternate trim control systems, according to Boeing
experts.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanic said he was not aware of any hidden breakers, and
he told the crew, ``we will see you on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The 20-minute tape of the conversation between the flight crew
and airline personnel on the ground is at the safety board's
Washington, D.C. labs.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB technicians will analyze that tape, and will transcribe 30
minutes of conversation captured by the plane's cockpit voice
recorder, which was recovered Wednesday. At a news conference
Thursday in Washington, D.C., NTSB Chairman Jim Hall gave this
account of what's on the tape:
</P>
<P>
   ``As the recording began, a flight crew is discussing an
existing problem with the airplane's stabilizing trim. The flight
crew decided to divert to Los Angeles International Airport.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The plane's out-of-trim condition became worse as the crew
attempted to diagnose or correct the problem. The crew had
difficulty to control the airplane's tendancy to pitch nose-down.
As the plane descended, the crew was able to arrest the descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crew continued trouble shooting and preparing for landing.
Then control was suddenly lost. The crew made reference to being
inverted.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses on the ground and in planes in the air near Flight 261
also reported seeing the jetliner inverted _ upside-down _ before
it hit the water nosedown at about an 80-degree angle.
</P>
<P>
   During his news conference, Hall was particularly critical of
the Seattle Times' recent report that Flight 261 had staibilizer
problems immediately prior to the flight that crashed. In a
copyrighted story Wednesday, the Times reported that the crew that
flew the plane from Seattle to Puerto Vallarta, which included a
stop in San Francisco, had reported stabilizer problems.
</P>
<P>
   Hammerschmidt said investigators Thursday interviewed the crew
of that flight, Alaska 158, and the pilots reported no such
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is ... that on the two previous legs, this
plane was reported to be fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A check of recent aircraft incidents and accidents shows only
one involving an MD-80 series jet that may have had problems
similar to Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
   That incident also involved an Alaska Airlines jet, but it
landed safely in Anchorage on Feb. 5, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 82 began in Fairbanks. The pilot of the MD-82 said he
noticed that the jet's nose failed to rise as he applied pressure
to the control yoke. The nose only came up ``when he applied an
excessive amount of aft control yoke pressure,'' according to the
National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   The horizontal stabilizer, which may have been at fault in the
crash of Flight 261, helps to control a plane's pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The plane took off, then the pilot declared an in-flight
emgergency. He landed at Anchorage but only after noticing that the
elevator control was sluggish and slow to the respond. The elevator
is a flight-control device at the rear of the horizontal stablizer.
</P>
<P>
   The incident remains under investigation. An Alaska spokesman
referred all questions about it to the NTSB.
</P>
<P>
   There were no injuries among the five crew members or 133
passengers. The plane was a different jet than the one that crashed
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Jammed or out-of-control horizontal stabilizers have led to at
least a half dozen emergency landings but never a crash of a
commercial airplane, federal records show.
</P>
<P>
   A review of problems involving the device over the last 20 years
show jamming is rare and has never driven a plane totally out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press examination of aviation records found that
at least 20 in-flight problems with stabilizers were serious enough
to be reported to the Federal Aviation Administration or the NTSB
since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   In two-thirds of those cases, the flights reached their intended
destination. The rest made emergency landings, including an
American Airlines MD-83, which returned to Phoenix minutes after
taking off Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   More than a half dozen of those cases involved jets made by
McDonnell Douglas, which also built the MD-83 that crashed off
Southern California. Five of those cases involved planes with
stabilizers mounted high on the tail, like the MD-83.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble similar to what Flight 261 pilots reported never before
led to a crash in the United States, according to experts and
aviation reports.

SLOT MACHINE'S ELUSIVE JACKPOT FRUSTRATES SOME STATION CASINO
GAMBLERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A $130,000 slot machine jackpot at Station
Casino Kansas City enticed a handful of players over the last month
to virtually live at the casino while gambling away small fortunes
hoping to win.
</P>
<P>
   They all lost.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the last players gave up Monday morning the
progressive jackpot had ballooned to $222,000. Late Thursday
afternoon, it reached $233,322 and was still growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had a day I won any money,'' said one man from
Excelsior Springs, who asked not to be identified because it would
embarrass his family. ``The best day I only lost $2,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The man, a former school administrator, said he and his wife had
lost around $98,000 playing the same slot machine almost around the
clock on the River King riverboat from Jan. 11 through Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can afford to lose it,'' he said of the money. ``But I
should have walked a long time ago. It was quite a costly
education.''
</P>
<P>
   They were among a small group of high-stakes gamblers the casino
treated to free hotel rooms and free meals during what turned into
a three-week marathon. During that time, six or seven persons
monopolized the linked trio of $5 Double Wild Cherry games
virtually every minute the casino was open.
</P>
<P>
   Under house rules, Station will ``cap'' a machine, or shut it
down and reserve it, for up to two hours, three times a day, for
high-rollers and other favored players.
</P>
<P>
   All casinos offer progressive slot games on their floors, but
most have jackpots of a few thousand dollars. The Double Wild
Cherry jackpot at Station grew so large it attracted a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   To try for the big jackpot players must drop two $5 coins on
each spin _ $10 per pull.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got sucked in big time,'' said a woman from Independence
who asked not to be identified. ``The free rooms were
enticing...and all that food. You feel like you're a king and a
queen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you find out you're a real dummy.''
</P>
<P>
   The middle-aged woman said she and her disabled, retired
boyfriend lost about $20,000 over six or seven days in late
January. She said he financed their run at the jackpot by cashing
in a retirement investment account.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he's broke,'' she said. ``He's all depressed...suicidal.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently none of the group knew each other at the outset.
</P>
<P>
   The man from Excelsior Springs insists the game was fixed,
malfunctioning or otherwise not giving players a fair shake.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no way that machine was paying the minimum legal
amount,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a master computer that they can make that (game) go
into a low pay, or high pay cycle. I believe that with all my
heart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he voiced that complaint to casino floor managers and to
the Missouri Gaming Commission agent on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing they said made me happy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Highway Patrol Sgt. Robert E. Zubeck, the agent in
charge at Station Casino, acknowledged meeting privately with the
Excelsior Springs man and said he tried to convince him there was
no master computer or ``magic button'' that manipulated payouts.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of many widely believed myths that Zubeck said he
had heard from players over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Computer chips that control the number of small and large
jackpots paid to players are certified by an independent testing
agency as accurate and honest, and then they are sealed into each
machine by gaming agents, Zubeck said. Electronic alarms sound any
time that seal is tampered with, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The chips are electronically re-verified every time a jackpot in
excess of $25,000 is won.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very upset,'' Zubeck said of the man who complained,
``and rightfully so. There was quite a bit of money going into
those machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, losing is part of gambling. I cannot protect
anybody from themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Independence woman said she and her friend hit plenty of
small jackpots along the way, including at least a half-dozen that
exceeded $1,000. ``But we put it all back in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A progressive jackpot builds with each pull of the handle,
taking a small percentage of every coin played. To offset the big
jackpot, casinos typically set the payback percentages on
progressive games several points lower than standard machines.
</P>
<P>
   By law, Missouri-licensed slot machines must pay back as
jackpots a minimum of 80 percent of all coins played through them.
In practice most devices pay in excess of 94 percent. But those
figures are averages calculated over hundreds of thousands of pulls
and do not apply to individual players or for any short time
period.
</P>
<P>
   A Station executive and a spokesman for International Game
Technology Inc. of Reno, Nev., the manufacuturer, declined to
disclose specific payback rates and other details of the Wild
Cherry games.
</P>
<P>
   If the Wild Cherry's big jackpot symbols appear on a one-coin
pull, the payout is only $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   And that has happened on Station's Wild Cherry games in recent
months, Zubeck said.
</P>
<P>
   But James Maida, president of New Jersey-based Gaming
Laboratories International Inc., which tests all Missouri slot
machines, said Thursday that those one-coin jackpots do not
influence either the short-term or long-term probabilities of the
jackpot symbols' next random appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may come again on the next pull, or a million pulls
later,'' Maida said.
</P>
<P>
   John V. Finamore, Station's president for Midwest operations,
said he regretted that the Wild Cherry players all walked out
losers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does us no good in the long run to have somebody end up in
that situation,'' he said. ``Believe me, I was hoping somebody
would win that jackpot'' during the marathon session.
</P>
<P>
   But Finamore makes no apologies for the casino's royal treatment
of the Wild Cherry high rollers.
</P>
<P>
   Free rooms, free food and preferential treatment for high-limit
players are ``pretty standard industry stuff,'' he said. ``We've
got formulas that determine benefits and what you're eligible for''
based on levels of play.
</P>
<P>
   Finamore said it's a touchy issue whether the casino regarded
any of the Wild Cherry players as compulsive gamblers. He wouldn't
discuss individual players' circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   He said employees were trained to spot problem gamblers and
intervene, including trying to talk the person into a cooling off
period away from the casino. The casino also gives those players a
hot-line number to reach Gamblers Anonymous and state-trained
counselors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to help them to the extent we can,'' said Finamore. ``I
cannot stop them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, the player has to have some responsibility.''

AMERICANS JUST ONE VICTORY FROM FINAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ In dominating, take-no-prisoners
fashion, the San Francisco-based America One syndicate pushed
Italy's Prada Challenge to the brink of elimination on Friday in
Race 7 of the Louis Vuitton series.
</P>
<P>
   With a 4-3 lead in the five-of-nine challenger finals, the
skipper Paul Cayard and his crew need just one more victory to
finish off Prada and set their sights on Team New Zealand in the
upcoming America's Cup. And Cayard likes where he is sitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be hard thing for them to stomach, to see somebody
come back after they were down 3-1,'' he said. ``The facts are they
have a fast boat and they can sail very well. But people are
people, and there's a human factor to this whole thing. And that
factor is now on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   From the get-go, the Italians sailed as if they were in a haze.
On the other hand, Cayard was in a sharp, feisty mood. He was ready
to tangle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Main out, Terry,'' he urged his mainsail trimmer, Terry
Hutchinson. ``You're stalling me, buddy.''
</P>
<P>
   America One twice engaged the Italians, but they were not game.
Cayard controlled the start and hit the line at full speed, sliding
past the committee boat and off to the right. On the opposite end
of the line, the Prada helmsman Francesco de Angelis needed to
pinch his bow up into the wind to skirt around the starting buoy.
It was the first, almost imperceptible sign of looming trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians continued to spin away to the left. As in Race 6,
the respective tacticians _ Prada's Torben Grael and America One's
John Kostecki _ were betting the farm on different sides of the
course. Grael called for a tack, and both boats lined up on port
and continued upwind.
</P>
<P>
   Prada, from its position inside of the San Franciscans, took the
lead. The Italians were exactly where they needed to be, in control
and in contact. Then, Grael peered to the left and saw something.
Perhaps it was a patch of dark water he took for better air
pressure. Maybe it the suggestion of an even stronger left-hand
shift. Something.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians tacked for it. But it was a mirage, a fleeting
image of glory unrealized. In an instant, the Italians had
self-destructed by measure of a simple, unforced error.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the course's opposite side, the San Franciscans held
course and then spun back on the heels of a strong, favorable
right-hand shift that brought fresher breeze as well. For Prada, it
was a double whammy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hung to their lefty for a long time,'' Cayard said.
``There were two winds and basically a no-man's land in the middle.
But we had more pressure than they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Prada continued on, its options now limited to hoping for a
change in the breeze as fortuitous as the one the Americans now
enjoyed. ``The wind is coming, the wind is coming,'' a Prada crew
member said, almost willing it to be so.
</P>
<P>
   But his prayer went unanswered. At one point, the side-by-side
separation between the two boats was over a mile. Prada and America
One were, quite literally, sailing in different waters. The
Americans tacked just twice up the beat and rounded the top mark,
one minute 19 seconds ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians could only hope for an American breakdown, and
their wish was partly granted. Moments after hoisting the
spinnaker, the boom vang aboard America One parted. The busted
hardware, which controls the mainsail boom and hence the set of the
main, temporarily slowed Cayard's progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were eight-tenths of a knot shy of our target boat speed,''
he said. ``It was a little nerve-wracking.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not enough, however, for Prada to make significant gains.
At the second of the 18.5-mile course's five turning marks, the
Italians had gained back only six seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Sailing from a position of power, Cayard would not let de
Angelis climb off the mat. Kostecki was now in a zone, hitting
another huge shift and extending his boat's widening gap. At mark
No. 3, the lead had extended to two minutes 31 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The rout was on. With main halyard problems on the last leg,
Cayard took his foot off the accelerator and the Italians closed to
within a minute and six seconds. But it was not really that close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was real aggressive today,'' Cayard said. ``I wanted
to be. I'm just getting more and more comfortable every day.''  &QL;

 GORE, BRADLEY COME WEST FOR VOTES  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI and JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Democratic presidential candidates began their battle for
California voters in earnest Thursday, as Bill Bradley drew a
capacity crowd despite a wild San Francisco storm and Vice
President Al Gore wrapped up an energetic two-day Southern
California swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future begins here in California, and I want to make sure
it's a brighter future for California and all of America,'' said
Gore, touring the Venice-based Digital Domain, an Academy
Award-winning special effects house.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign, meanwhile, also met the challenges of the
nation's most populous state.
</P>
<P>
   Moments before he was to arrive at the Ferry Building in San
Francisco, a violent squall blew in, knocking down rope lines,
ripping signs off posts and whipping sound equipment with a cold
rain.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the rally was moved to nearby Gabbiano's
restaurant, where 1,700 supporters, mostly students, filled the top
floor, then piled along stairs and even out into the rain to hear
their candidate slam Gore's ``grandiose and unfulfilled promises.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand on the shores of the bay and ask you to help me,''
said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   With five weeks to go before the crucial California primary on
March 7, Bradley and Gore have fully immersed themselves in
courting California voters, and will both return next weekend for
the state Democratic convention in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, the differing profiles of the competing Democrats
_ in message, theme and support _ emerged clearly in campaign
stops.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has the support of most of the state's leading
Democratic politicians, campaigned with popular Gov. Gray Davis at
his side. Although the vice president never mentioned President
Clinton by name, he took credit for the economic upturn of the past
seven years and used Clinton's own words when he talked about
``investing in our future.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore appeared especially intent on proving his stamina in
California _ capping a 22-hour, four-stop campaign day with a Los
Angeles town hall meeting Wednesday in which he stayed until after
1 a.m. to answer every participant's questions, as promised.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bradley announced his endorsement by the Harvey Milk
Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Democratic Club, San
Francisco's largest gay and lesbian political organization, and
appeared with Democratic endorsers who tended to underscore his
``outsider'' appeal _ San Francisco Board of Supervisors President
Tom Ammiano, U.S. Rep. George Miller of Martinez, state Sens. John
Vasconcellos of San Jose and Jackie Speier of Burlingame,
Assemblyman Lou Papan of Millbrae and even former San Francisco
Mayor Frank Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley argued that Gore ``talks about universal health
insurance, but he doesn't have a plan to get (it). ... How will a
candidate who doesn't care enough about the people to tell them the
truth in a campaign then tell the truth as president?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   But the former New Jersey senator saved his toughest stuff for
GOP front-runner George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley lambasted the Texas governor for a campaign stop at Bob
Jones University in South Carolina, which prohibits interracial
dating, to deliver a speech on the meaning of conservatism. ``(The
institution) explicitly discriminates on the basis of race,''
Bradley said, adding, ``That is what conservatism is.''
</P>
<P>
   In Southern California, Gore used a high-tech special effects
studio as a backdrop for his education message. He toured the
Digital Domain studio, telling 50 workers there, ``There are 30
jobs here that can't be filled, good jobs paying $65,000 to $70,000
a year. ... They can't find enough people with enough education _
to operate the computers and software they use.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore touted his plan to use 10 percent of the nation's soaring
budget surplus to improve education in America, providing federal
funds for such initiatives as universal preschool, tuition savings
plans, increased college grants and school construction.
</P>
<P>
   He also took a slap at Bradley, whom he called ``a good man with
a bad plan'' for education. He charged that by pledging to spend
most of the budget surplus on health care, Bradley could not make
the financial commitment needed for the nation's schools, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bradley) has not made a single speech in the presidential
campaign about educational reform,'' Gore said. ``It's not a
priority in his campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's latest California trip began Wednesday night, after a
long day that had taken him from New Hampshire to New York City,
Washington, D.C., and Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   After greeting about 250 well-wishers, the vice president made
his way to Los Angeles City College for a town-hall-style meeting
with about 300 undecided voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I want to talk to you is probably pretty obvious,''
Gore told them. ``If you are an undecided voter in the March 7
primary, you are now the most sought-after person in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, for nearly two hours, the vice president, clad in a sport
shirt and khaki pants, answered questions from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   He talked about Proposition 22, the initiative that would define
marriage as between a man and a woman. (``I oppose the Knight
Initiative,'' he said. ``I think it's mean-spirited in too many
ways.'')
</P>
<P>
   The vice president left California Thursday for Olympia, Wash.,
before returning to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was set to fly to Maryland last night, then to New
Jersey and Florida.

FORMER NEBRASKA COACH IN CONGRESSIONAL RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. _ Tom Osborne's manner is easy. His frame is tall,
angular, trim almost to the point of skinny. His voice is soft, the
sort projected by men confident of being listened to without
talking particularly fast or especially loud.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the longtime University of Nebraska football coach,
having spent most of his life engineering option plays and the
occasional fumblerooski, officially threw his soft-sell persona
into the far rougher game of politics.
</P>
<P>
   The papers Osborne filed Thursday as a Republican candidate in
the state's 3rd Congressional District also puts to a public vote
the popularity he has groomed with Nebraskans for the last quarter
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be shocking if he doesn't win, and doesn't win easily,''
said Jeff Spinner-Halev, a political science professor at the
University of Nebraska. ``He is adored.''
</P>
<P>
   So adored, in fact, that the state's heavyweight politicians
waited to jump into the race for the U.S. Senate seat soon to be
abandoned by Bob Kerrey until they knew Osborne was going for
something else.
</P>
<P>
   All this with hardly a public word from the candidate about
taxes, abortion, trade policy or _ something that has little to do
with x's and o's _ the nation's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Though supporters and potential rivals alike insist the warmth
Nebraskans feel for Osborne extends beyond football, they agree as
well that he rates so well because for so long the football
Cornhuskers have ranked so high.
</P>
<P>
   Even the proudest of Nebraskans concede that the state's natural
and cultural wonders are acquired tastes. The speed, muscle and
discipline of the football team, on the other hand, have been
obvious to the rest of the country for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state takes a great pride in its populist tradition, in
the unique architecture of the state capitol, in the Sand Hills
region,'' said John Comer, a political science professor at the
University of Nebraska. ``(But) the Midwest in general suffers from
an inferiority complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Nebraska, we can at least point to the football team and
say we have something the rest of the country respects.''
</P>
<P>
   Osborne's predecessor as football coach, Bob Devaney, was so
revered for elevating the team from average to awesome in the 1960s
_ culminating in consecutive national championships in the early
1970s _ that people talked about how he might make a decent
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne topped Devaney's record, cementing the Cornhuskers as a
perennial top-10 team before bringing home a pair of national
championships and sharing part of a third.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Comer and others say his popularity comes from more than
just winning. (In fact, for much of his career many Nebraskans were
disappointed that he loaded the team's schedule with too many
patsies and then for so many years came up short in the biggest
games against the best teams.)
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Comer said, Osborne reflected the state
in a way Nebraskans like to see themselves _ modestly and
compassionately.
</P>
<P>
   His retirement came amid a heart condition _ he underwent double
bypass surgery in 1985 and was hospitalized with an irregular
heartbeat in November 1997 _ and a publicly stated desire to spend
more time with family and on charity work. He says he is healthy
now.
</P>
<P>
   If there is uncertainty about how a congressman starting his
political career in his sixties might fare in the nation's Capitol,
there's plenty of consensus on how Osborne will rate with voters in
Hastings and points west.
</P>
<P>
   He's long been active in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.
Since retiring after the Cornhuskers won the 1997 national
championship, Osborne has spent his time in a Nebraska-centered
program that encourages fathers to remain involved in the lives of
their children and a program that mentors young people who are at
risk of getting into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anyone in Nebraska who holds the same
reservoir of affection,'' Comer said.
</P>
<P>
   As for politics, Osborne said in an interview that he's studying
the issues of central and western Nebraska. He doesn't yet, he
said, ``have all the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   He decided against a Senate bid because ``I just felt more
comfortable'' for the less prestigious House seat.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne wants, he says, to look for a way to turn around the
prospects of his district. While the population centers of Lincoln
and Omaha have enjoyed the boom times propelling the economy over
most of the country, times have been harder in the west.
</P>
<P>
   Its farmers have been battered by lousy crop prices and scared
by the threat of declining subsidies. Meantime, like much of rural
America, its youngest and most trainable workers have fled in
search of work.
</P>
<P>
   As a congressman, Osborne said he would lobby businesses _
``companies like Mutual of Omaha'' _ to put some of the more mobile
jobs in the western four-fifths of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne, 62, lives in Lincoln. But he grew up in Hastings, where
he owns a home and nearby farmland. He plans to set up residence in
another of his homes at Lake McConaughy near Ogallala.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I bring any strength to the situation,'' Osborne said in an
interview, ``it's that I think I can bring a team in place to take
care of things....
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly not going to stand Washington on its ear, but I
think I'll be heard.''

TV'S ANTI-DRUG WINDFALL REVEALED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY VALERIE KUKLENSKI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
  LOS ANGELES _ When New York Giants football Hall of Famer
Lawrence Taylor talked with an ESPN reporter about his crack
cocaine addiction, he wasn't just helping kids learn about the
dangers of drug abuse.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was helping the sports network reap a windfall profit of
$796,796 in advertising money from the White House's anti-drug
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's ``Up Close'' on Taylor, aired Feb. 9, 1999, and two other
segments aired during the previous eight days were among 17
programs for which the sports cable network received credit from
the Office of National Drug Control Policy's TV advertising
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   From a wide range of network sitcoms and dramas to a VH-1
``Legends'' retrospective on Johnny Cash to nine segments of
``America's Most Wanted'' and seven stories last April 15 on New
York Yankees outfielder Darryl Strawberry, television cashed in big
on the White House's anti-drug effort.
</P>
<P>
   Documents presented Thursday at a Senate subcommittee hearing in
Washington detailed for the first time the wide range of shows the
ONDCP used in its program-content-for-advertising trade-off and the
total value each network earned against the free time it owed the
drug office.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was part of the ONDCP's $1 billion, five-year anti-drug
advertising campaign approved by Congress in 1997. The networks
agreed to provide free public service time to the ONDCP equal in
value to their paid schedules, but could get back the time based on
a formula that gave them credit for anti-drug programming.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1998, the networks have been submitting scripts or
videotapes of shows that deliver anti-drug messages, and the ONDCP
and its powerhouse advertising agency, Ogilvy &AMP; Mather, have used
an elaborate point system to rebate some unpaid commercial time
back to the networks.
</P>
<P>
   ABC made the largest overall transaction in the program content
swap, getting back a total net of more than $6.4 million worth of
air time from July 1998 through August 1999 for 68 original
episodes and eight reruns.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were episodes of ``NYPD Blue,'' ``The Practice,''
``Sabrina the Teenage Witch,'' ``Sports Night,'' and 48
installments of ``General Hospital'' dealing with drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Fox ranked second in total credits with $4.7million earned
between August 1998 and September 1999 for 14 programs, nine of
which were ``America's Most Wanted'' episodes. Fox also received
credit for a May 1999 episode of ``Chicago Hope,'' which is
produced by Fox but aired on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   The WB Network ranked third in total dollars at $4.3 million
credited from October 1998 through August 1999, but its
teen-oriented programs are most valuable to the ONDCP.
</P>
<P>
   It received credit for 10 program airings (including five
different episodes of the family-friendly series ``7th Heaven'') at
an average of $433,500 each. ABC's entire slate averaged out to
just under $85,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   The documentation shows the WB could be hit hardest by a Senate
subcommittee's decision Thursday to draw up new legislation
changing the terms of the ONDCP funding to eliminate the program
content exchange option.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-drug advertising campaign still will be funded, but the
networks will have to make up their free portion in commercial
time, not programming.
</P>
<P>
   Jed Petrick, executive vice president of media sales for the WB,
is taking a wait-and-see attitude about the pending policy change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would want to talk to the ONDCP about what that means,''
Petrick said. ``I imagine Alan (Levitt, director of the ONDCP media
campaign) and his people will want to sit down and talk about how
to do business and we'll take it from there.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS received $1.75 million in credit for seven prime-time shows,
among them ``Touched by an Angel,'' ``Promised Land'' and
``Cosby,'' for an average net credit of $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   NBC leaned heavily on its teen-targeted Saturday morning block,
submitting episodes of ``Hang Time,'' ``Saved by the Bell,'' ``One
World'' and ``City Guys'' that addressed alcohol, smoking and drug
use.
</P>
<P>
   NBC also received credit for two episodes of ``ER'' and one
``Suddenly Susan'' for a total net of $2.8 million, or $142,000 per
airing.
</P>
<P>
   Music network VH-1 parlayed its celebrity profiles in ``Behind
the Music'' and ``Legends'' into a net credit of $903,656 for 15
original airings and 304 reruns aired from May 1998 to January
1999.
</P>
<P>
   That means discussions of Who drummer Keith Moon's fatal drug
overdose, David Crosby's destroyed liver and Eric Clapton's
struggles with heroin and alcohol addiction.
</P>
<P>
   The average credit for VH-1 was $2,833 per broadcast.

BRANSON BACK IN SPOTLIGHT AS MISS USA PAGEANT RETURNS 
</HEADLINE>
 USA-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ At a kickoff event for this year's Miss USA
Pageant in Branson, contestants donated items from their home
states for a silent auction for charity. Miss Florida offered a
sculpture of dolphins. Miss Vermont brought maple syrup.
</P>
<P>
   If buyers needed extra motivation, the smiling contestants took
pictures with the winning bidders.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty good incentive right there,'' said Susan
Marcussen, executive director of the Branson Arts Council, which
raised $11,559 from the auction.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers found it just as easy to sell Branson on the
responsibilities of being host of the pageant. The Ozarks tourist
mecca embraced the role last year _ including the high-dollar tab _
with little hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   But as the pageant returns tonight for its second year, some in
Branson have viewed the event with a more skeptical eye.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the buzz is still there. Hundreds have turned out to meet
the contestants at the auction, a fashion show and concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Branson, however, were not as eager to extend the
welcome mat as last year. Some say sponsorship costs were not worth
it. Others raised eyebrows at risque content that seemed out of
place in this family town.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always learning. We see no reason to change last year's
formula, but it's always an evolutionary process,'' said Scott
Hall, president and executive director of Syncor Special Events
Management, a local nonprofit company that is host of the pageant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do know that an event like this can't work unless you have
support from the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Branson leaders still hope to keep the pageant. Their deal ends
this year, and discussions continue on keeping the pageant here
longer.
</P>
<P>
   In Branson the Miss USA pageant has found a host city with a
popular stable of entertainers, extensive facilities and a national
brand name.
</P>
<P>
   Branson saw the pageant as a way to spread its image beyond its
core constituency _ retirees _ to families and young tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The pageant is a virtual Branson infomercial, with a nationwide
audience of almost 13 million watching lengthy segments on the
town's attractions _ from rail tours to water sports.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Branson's share of sponsorship is $100,000 of
taxpayer money, up one-third from last year. Officials say the
expense is worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pageant exposes our area to millions of people in one
night,'' city spokesman Jerry Adams said. ``We see it as a very
good investment.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's sales tax revenue last February increased 53 percent
from February 1998, Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when the party was over, some left with regrets.
</P>
<P>
   The Springfield/Branson Regional Airport, which handles the
scores of delegates, relatives and staff members who fly in,
contributed $75,000 as one of the 1999 pageant's ``Sterling Crown''
co-sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   For that the airport received a fleeting mention on the
telecast, in which it was misidentified as the ``Branson Airport.''
</P>
<P>
   The airport is not sponsoring the pageant this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope was to get the word out that we're the destination
airport for Branson. We don't feel like we were able to accomplish
that,'' said Leigh Daniels, the airport's director of marketing and
communications.
</P>
<P>
   The Radisson Hotel Branson's frustrations linger nearly a year
after it signed on as a pageant ``Platinum Sponsor.''
</P>
<P>
   The hotel housed all the delegates and donated $200,000 in cash
and in-kind services. But the hotel backed out of this year's
event, saying that Syncor owed it $38,000 in payment for rooms sold
at reduced rates.
</P>
<P>
   Syncor disputed the claim but declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Branson Chamber of Commerce, which saw the tourist
response firsthand, reduced its financial commitment from $75,000
to $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, pageant organizers have recruited more than 50
major sponsors and dozens of volunteers. Most in the community _
from longtime residents to hotel owners _ are thrilled to host the
pageant again.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Laughlin, co-owner of Tri-Lakes Cleaners in nearby
Hollister, signed up again as a sponsor. She agreed to clean all
the clothing of delegates and staff members, at a cost up to
$2,500.
</P>
<P>
   But Branson will be the biggest beneficiary, Laughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really didn't matter how much we made. It was all about
letting the rest of the area know that I'm standing behind our
community,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The pageant also is trying to reassure residents who were put
off by the tone of last year's telecast.
</P>
<P>
   Host Shemar Moore, a soap opera star, angered some residents as
he practically leered at the contestants. In one exchange, he asked
Miss Tennessee how she would decorate his bedroom. During the
swimsuit portion, the band played ``What's New, Pussycat?''
</P>
<P>
   As a protest, resident Ben Kinel collected more than 1,200
signatures asking for a new host. He suggested Branson favorite Jim
Stafford, not exactly a big name with the pageant's Gen-X audience.
</P>
<P>
   Pageant officials said they took residents' opinions into
consideration when selecting their new host: Carson Daly, a
heartthrob VJ on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Kinel said he thinks pageant organizers are trying to work with
the city and be gracious guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've tried to make this something Branson can be proud
of,'' Kinel said. ``In the end, we're glad to have them here.''

TEEN DIES IN HOUSE FIRE; SEVEN CHILDREN ESCAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE VENDEL  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Jacqueline Woods heard screams early Thursday
as she locked her front door to go to bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey! Help!''
</P>
<P>
   It was 3:30 on an icy Thursday morning. She pulled aside a
curtain and looked across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a man standing on the porch, with no shirt and no shoes.
He was frantic, looking to the left and right,'' Woods said. ``Then
I saw flames leaping up the left side of his house. I opened my
door and shouted, `I'm calling for help right now!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Her stomach turned as she thought of the nine children in the
house. She called 911. Then she shouted to her.MDNM/ 18-year-old
son, Vincent Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Heroic efforts by family and neighbors would save eight of the
children. But 18-year-old Laura Williams-Rockley couldn't escape
the fire at 5111 Park Ave., becoming the fifth fire fatality in
Kansas City this year.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses and fire officials reconstructed the event this way:
Inside the burning house, the smell of smoke woke 16-year-old
Jalita Ennis.
</P>
<P>
   She grabbed her 18-year-old sister's hand and the hand of
another child, and then they ran down a dark flight of stairs, the
thick smoke stinging their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Ennis and the younger girl headed toward a bathroom window on
the right side of the house. In the commotion, Ennis' hand slipped
from her older sister's. But Ennis thought her sister, Laura
Williams-Rockley, was still right behind her.
</P>
<P>
   Ennis rounded up the children, some in T-shirts and underwear,
others in pajama bottoms. They screamed as she tried to keep them
together in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, her father, Percy Williams, and his girlfriend, Paula
Nevells, had escaped out their bedroom window. To rescue the
children, the father punched the bathroom window, breaking the
glass. From inside, Ennis tore out the window screen, cutting her
hand. Then the daughter handed the children out one by one..MDNM/
</P>
<P>
   The flames reached higher, touching the roof on the left side of
the house. About the same time, Jacqueline Woods, her son, and his
girlfriend, LaSan Gray, came running across the street.
</P>
<P>
   They saw Nevells calling her eight children by name to the
window and coaching them out. As they escaped, the children
struggled to stand on the cold ground in their bare feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were slipping and sliding on the ice,'' Jacqueline Woods
said. ``I grabbed a few and ran them back to my house to keep
warm.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Woods and Gray took others and soon they had all but two
of the children in their home.
</P>
<P>
   Jalita Ennis, the last to crawl out the bathroom window.MDNM/,
stumbled toward Woods' house.
</P>
<P>
   But her older sister didn't come out.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Percy Williams, ran toward the front door, but
firefighters held him back. The firefighters extinguished the blaze
and quickly searched the house for Williams-Rockley. They found her
body in an upstairs bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   The five fire fatalities in the first few weeks of 2000 compare
with two fire deaths during the first two months of 1999. Fire
officials say December and January are often the months with the
most fire fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   Before paramedics arrived at the scene, Gray said, she gave
cardiopulmonary resuscitation to a 5-year-old boy and revived a
young girl, too. Gray is trained in CPR as a Jackson County Family
Court youth worker.
</P>
<P>
   Later paramedics treated the victims. Ambulances took 10 persons
to two area hospitals, where they received treatment for smoke
inhalation, cuts and burns. Authorities and family members
identified them as Percy Williams, 42, Paula Nevells, 31, Jalita
Ennis, 16, Jessica Nevells, 10, Miesha Young, 10, Jesse Young, 8,
Paula Young, 7, Andrew Young, 6, Dominic Young, 5, and Shannta
Nevells, 3.
</P>
<P>
   Only Jalita remained hospitalized late Thursday with a serious
cut on her hand and burns to her hands and face.
</P>
<P>
   Family members Thursday said they were too distraught to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials said they thought the blaze had started in the
kitchen but declined to release the cause. They were investigating
whether the stove may have been the source.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Department spokesman Brad Humston said the family
apparently used the electric stove's burners to heat the house. The
family didn't have the gas turned on in November when they moved
in.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Gas Energy officials said they had not provided service
to the residence since August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters did not find smoke detectors in the house. Damage
was estimated at $25,000. The American Red Cross lodged the family
at a hotel.

CONVERGENCE VENTURE BUOYS TEKELEC STOCK

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
  CALABASAS, Calif. _ Shares of Calabasas-based Tekelec Inc.
climbed 25 percent Thursday as investors rallied behind a positive
earnings report.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The company on Wednesday beat Wall Street's estimate by 2 cents
per share and investors promptly snapped up the stock, boosting it
$6.5625 to a Thursday close of $32.5625.
</P>
<P>
   The company builds signals that maintain traffic flow through
telecommunications networks. Its latest venture and the one that
has investors drooling is convergence.
</P>
<P>
   Tekelec is one of the companies with products designed to merge
voice and data communications on the same networks. Convergence
squeezes voice and data transmissions together on lines that
previously held one or the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real opportunity for Tekelec for the future,'' said
company spokesman Erik Randerson. ``We've got a new line that
really targets the convergence of voice and data.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about efficiency,'' said Brian Modoff, stock analyst
with Deutsche Banc Alex Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Modoff was one of a handful of analysts to reiterate their
favorable ratings of Tekelec's stock. He renewed his ``strong buy''
rating and set a 6- to 12-month price target of $50 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Stock analysts aren't the only ones taking an interest in
Tekelec and its IP7 line of products.
</P>
<P>
   Customers have been placing orders for Tekelec's convergence
products at an increasing pace, the company said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The company's orders increased 76 percent over the fourth
quarter of 1998 to $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good indication of future demand,'' Modoff said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Tekelec's revenues beat his estimate by $4 million or 4
cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 the company reported net
income of $12 million, or 20 cents per share, on record sales of
$76.9 million. For the 1998 fourth quarter Tekelec earned $9.3
million, or 16 cents per share, on sales of $49.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   For all of 1999 the company earned $26.6 million, 45 cents per
share, on sales of $226.1 million vs. net income of $34.5 million,
59 cents per share, on sales of $176.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The year-end results costs are associated with the
second-quarter acquisition of IEX Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Modoff projects earnings per share of 62 cents this fiscal year.
He said he expects fiscal year 2001 to result in earnings of 90
cents per share, 2 cents more than the average of his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a strong quarter for the company,'' Modoff said. ``We
think this convergence story and their position in convergence is
starting to become clear.''

 MCCAIN REVERSING BUSH'S FORTUNES  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW, JOHN WILDERMUTH and LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Arizona Sen. John McCain's startling victory in New
Hampshire has turned the Republican presidential contest on its
head, as money poured into his campaign Thursday and a new poll
showed him overtaking Texas Gov. George W. Bush in the next pivotal
primary state of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign strategists have said for months that a weak
showing by Bush in New Hampshire would puncture the governor's aura
of invincibility and force Republicans to rethink what just weeks
ago looked to be Bush's inevitable coronation as the party's
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   In the two days since McCain's 18-point victory in New
Hampshire, his campaign has raised more than $1.2 million,
including $1 million via the Internet, aides said. The infusion
still leaves McCain considerably behind Bush in fund raising, but
it provides the senator with enough money to compete in the
media-intensive states ahead, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   And a poll released Thursday by Zogby International found that
McCain _ who trailed Bush by more than 20 percentage points in
South Carolina just a week ago _ received a tremendous boost from
his New Hampshire victory.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 517 likely primary voters found 44 percent
supporting McCain, 39.3 percent supporting Bush and just 5 percent
supporting the remainder of the field. The other 11.7 percent were
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the power of New Hampshire,'' poll director John Zogby
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stumping in the coastal community of Beaufort, S.C., McCain
disputed Bush's assessment of the New Hampshire results as merely a
``bump in the road.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen,'' McCain said, ``it was
a land mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, McCain is scheduled to arrive in California, where
he will address the state Republican Party convention in Burlingame
Saturday afternoon. The campaign also has scheduled a flurry of
money-raising events in the state over the next few weeks,
including one at the home of a San Francisco supporter Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,200 delegates at this weekend's three-day GOP convention
also will get to see a Bush, but not the one they had hoped for.
With the Texas governor returning home for the first time in nearly
a month, his brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, will step in and speak
at tonight's opening dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Bush passed up last fall's party convention to attend the Ryder
Cup golf tournament, annoying a number of California Republicans.
His decision to skip this weekend's affair is not likely to make
him any more friends, although party officials are putting the best
face on Bush's absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor is committed to running a 50-state campaign, so
we have to deal with the cards that are dealt us,'' said Margita
Thompson, a spokeswoman for Bush's California campaign. ``That in
no way diminishes the importance of California to the Bush
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a lowly party chairman, and I know how many people
are mad at me because I can't be two places at once,'' said John
McGraw, state party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and McCain expect to spend most of their time the next
several weeks in South Carolina, which holds its primary February
19.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning there Thursday, Bush said McCain is engaging in
``Washington-style politics'' by saying the Bush tax plan would not
leave enough money for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by five Congressional Medal of Honor winners and five
retired generals, he said he would not let McCain ``get away'' with
portraying himself as an outsider and Bush as an insider.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is, he's the person who's been a Washington
insider,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to hearing speeches by Jeb Bush and McCain, as well
as several other GOP candidates, delegates to the California GOP
convention will set the party's position on March 7 statewide
ballot measures and vote on a platform for state Republican
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials are trying to limit the infighting over issues
such as abortion and gun control that has roiled recent
conventions. McGraw, a strong opponent of abortion, has been the
target for much of the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   An 80-member committee has been working to trim the party
platform and make it more a statement of general principles than a
list of very specific, and sometimes divisive, issues.
</P>
<P>
   The platform, which was 37 pages four years ago, already has
been slashed to six pages and could shrink further before the
delegates vote on it Sunday, said Rob Lapsley, who works for
Secretary of State Bill Jones, the state's top elected Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the platform committee is done, we hope to just adopt
(the platform) and not have a huge floor fight where it's debated
all over,'' Lapsley said. ``Our goal is absolutely to keep our
focus on beating the Democrats in November.''
</P>
<P>
   But if there is a dispute over the party's direction, that is
not necessarily a problem, McGraw said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't require every member of the party to walk in
lockstep,'' the party chairman said. ``We don't want people to
leave the party. They should stay in and fight for what they
want.''
</P>
<P>

Washington, Lynda Gledhill reported from Sacramento and John
Wildermuth reported from San Francisco.)

 UNTIMELY FINAL CHAPTER IN LIVES OF PASSENGERS  &HT;     By KEVIN FAGAN, RICK DELVECCHIO and STACY FINZ 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT HUENEME _ In the last hours of the last day of her life,
Joan Smith caught a few final rays under the Mexican sun, lounging
by the pool of her rented Puerto Vallarta condo. Her annual
monthlong vacation wasn't supposed to end yet, but the medical
office she managed in San Francisco had just called, begging her to
fly back early to handle business.
</P>
<P>
   So, that morning, she hugged her son and daughter as they went
off on a fishing trip and boarded a jetliner heading north,
memories of her summer-in-winter southland getaway fresh in her
head and the promise of home bright before her.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines Flight 261 finished seating Smith and 82 other
men, women and children just before 1:30 p.m. Monday, and within
minutes, the crew of five had the big plane soaring over the tile
roofs of one of Mexico's premier tourist meccas. Flight attendants
started loading the ovens with chicken-and-shrimp trays and ham
sandwiches for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere over Baja California, the peanuts, sodas and juices
were handed out, and Capt. Ted Thompson chattily filled the
passengers in on altitude, journey time and weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   It was a typical airline trip _ until 4:10 p.m. That's when,
cruising just off Los Angeles at 26,000 feet, the crew radioed the
local radio control tower to say the trouble they were having with
their horizontal stabilizer, the tail flap that kept the MD-80 jet
level, was getting serious.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the plane suddenly dipped 2,300 feet.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 miles north, in the sleepy fishing town of Port
Hueneme, police Cmdr. Fernie Estrella was shuffling papers in his
office, quitting time minutes away. One town over, in Oxnard, Rick
Purscell was shooting hoops to shake off a hard day's slog on his
fishing boat. The Naval Construction Battalion Center, a flat,
nondescript base sprawling between the two towns, began to stand
down for the evening as Bill Boyd went over checklists for his
helicopter rescue squad.
</P>
<P>
   At Los Angeles International Airport, as dispatchers monitored
the increasingly worrisome radio traffic offshore, Flight 261
passenger Juan Marquez's close buddy Silverio Montoya sat in a
plane, waiting to head back to Fresno after a business trip.
</P>
<P>
   Everything predictable about their day's-end routine, and about
the journey of the 88 people shooting through the airspace
overhead, was about to end.
</P>
<P>
   Not much is known about what exactly went wrong so quickly and
so grievously with the Alaska Airlines jet, but at 4:16 p.m., Capt.
Thompson asked air traffic control for clearance to fly lower in an
attempt to wrestle control over the balky stabilizer. He got the OK
to drop to 17,000 feet. Then the radio went dead.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime within the next few minutes, the plane pitched suddenly
earthward, corkscrewing and tumbling with breathtaking speed. At
4:20 p.m. and 52 seconds, a nearby air control center's radar
picked up the plane at 1,600 feet off the water. Seconds later,
Flight 261 plowed into the sea nose-first, 10 miles offshore from
Port Hueneme. The fall from 17,000 feet had taken an estimated 34
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data and voice recorders fetched up from the ocean
bottom may yet reveal more of the final efforts by Thompson and his
crew to straighten out their craft. But the picture painted by
eyewitnesses and experts is painful enough.
</P>
<P>
   Suitcases would have poured from overhead compartments, food
carts tumbling down the aisles, and anyone without a seat belt
would have been hurled throughout the fuselage, said Paul Cvysz, an
aeronautics expert with Parks College at St. Louis University.
</P>
<P>
   It's likely that everyone was alive and aware until the instant
the plane slammed the water, he said _ though other experts say
consciousness may have been dim. It's a terror that few in history
have lived to recount.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be like you were on a steep roller coaster,'' Cvysz
said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane shattered on impact, sending up a whoosh of water
easily seen from Anacapa Island a mile away. A park worker on the
island later told investigators he heard ``popping sounds'' before
the splash _ and then, there was silence.
</P>
<P>
   But not for long.
</P>
<P>
   In minutes, a smattering of eyewitness calls hit 911
dispatchers, the Coast Guard went on alert, and all along the
Oxnard-Port Hueneme waterfront, hundreds of people sprang into
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``An officer runs by my door saying, ``Plane down in the ocean,'
'' recalled Commander Estrella, a 30-year veteran of his town's
force. ``We dropped what we doing and leaped into our cars and
drove to Hueneme Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers were already starting to filter down to the
waterside with them, and everyone strained to see what they could
in the fading daylight. Several hundred yards behind them at the
base, Boyd was already scrambling his six men onto their two UH1
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We loaded in every flotation device we could, and several life
rafts, and took off in six minutes,'' said Boyd, a Ventura County
sheriff's captain who coordinates search and rescue operations with
the Navy and Coast Guard. Just six months before, his crew had
drilled for exactly this sort of disaster, he said, ``so we had an
idea of what we'd find. We knew it wouldn't be good.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of minutes later, they got a look at what was left of
Flight 261. His heart sank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pulled over toward Anacapa Island and the first thing we
saw was this huge oil slick,'' Boyd said in a matter-of-fact tone
honed through two decades of responding to forest fires, floods and
earthquakes. ``Then we saw all the debris, and we knew this was the
biggest crash we'd ever dealt with.''
</P>
<P>
   On the beach, Estrella and his officers started cordoning off
the sand and combing the shoreline for debris, and with binoculars,
the water for survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we would only have minutes,'' he said. ``We knew
chances of rescue were slim to none. But we had to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Purscell, relaxing after his basketball game, didn't need orders
to get cracking.
</P>
<P>
   ``My girlfriend said she heard there was a crash, and I didn't
even stop to put on my shoes. I just grabbed 'em and took off,''
said Purscell, 36. ``Three of us got on our boat, and we got out
there just after dark.''
</P>
<P>
   He stood on Port Hueneme's tidy little dock two days later,
swaying slightly from exhaustion _ he hadn't slept since that
moment he grabbed his shoes. With a quick laugh, one silver earring
and a neat goatee to match his shoulder-length blond hair, he was
every inch the hip Southern Californian, but when he remembered the
moment he got close to the first Coast Guard cutter, Purscell's
deeply tanned face tightened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We flicked on our spotlight, and there it all was _ seats,
plane pieces, body parts, lettuce, peanut wrappers, cups, floating
everything,'' Purscell said. He spread his arms four feet. ``The
biggest piece of plane was probably this big.''
</P>
<P>
   The nets that the veteran rockfish fisherman and his crew thrust
into the water came up with something new every time that night. By
dawn, they had plucked up 200 pounds of debris.
</P>
<P>
   None of it was what they wanted. None of it was what anyone
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for survivors, we all wanted survivors,''
Purscell said. ``We had lotsa lights, lotsa nets. Lotsa prayers.
But no luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve hundred miles south, back in Puerto Vallarta, Joan
Smith's son Jesse and daughter Holly came back from the eight-hour
fishing expedition they had started before their mother left and
got a phone call from the Bay Area. It was Richard, their brother.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Alexa, had seen the news and were worried about
the father of Jesse's girlfriend, Roger Boehner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Roger on the flight? There has been a crash,'' Richard
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you talking about? Mom left this afternoon,'' Holly
replied, and the dread began to sink in.
</P>
<P>
   As the night wore on with no encouraging word, Richard rushed to
San Francisco International Airport and the VIP room staffed by
priests and counselors. About a dozen other victims' survivors had
also heard the news. He told an officer his fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my mother is on that flight. I'm pretty darn sure,''
Richard said, his eyes filled with tears.
</P>
<P>
   The inevitable was confirmed, but it took time. After two days
in which 1,400 rescue workers using helicopters, radar and
everything else they could muster crisscrossed the Santa Barbara
Channel, searchers finally admitted defeat.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear the entire planeload of passengers and crew _ Joan
Smith, whole families with babies in tow, pilots, flight attendants
_ was gone.
</P>
<P>
   The stories of their lives emerged in hours _ stories that, but
for the crash, might never have been known beyond their city
borders. Now, in the spotlight of grief, those stories suddenly
became remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   There was 39-year-old South San Francisco firefighter Robert
Ost, a crack veteran who climbed mountains in his spare time. He
died with his wife, Ileana, their 4-month-old Emily and Ost's
mother and her longtime companion. There was 34-year-old Juan
Marquez, who with his lover, Dale Rettinger, often shuttled between
San Francisco and Puerto Vallarta, where they had a condo.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there was Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was an amazingly loving mother and grandmother,'' Alexa
said days after the crash. ``Anyone who was sick or needed help,
Joan was always the first one to take care of them. She was a real
caregiver.''
</P>
<P>
   Every year, when Smith went on vacation from her work managing
San Francisco Internal Medicine Associates on Bush Street, she
headed south. There are many playlands in Mexico that draw
Americans, but the magic of Puerto Vallarta drew Smith as no other.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton's torrid affair
there grabbed international headlines in 1964, the Mexican resort
town's pristine beaches and colonial charm have attracted the rich
and famous. Travel agents say it has become the top Mexican resort
destination for gay people, but with its tony boutiques, idyllic
shoreline and great food, the appeal spreads across all tourist
lines.
</P>
<P>
   It was this appeal that called to many of Flight 261's planeload
of strangers and friends. By midweek, after trying so hard, so
long, so valiantly to rescue them all, the men and women manning
the helicopters, boats and command centers were nearly as
devastated as the families _ and any thought of vacation or
frivolity had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Point Hueneme shoreline _ a surfer's paradise of
wide beaches and million-dollar water-view homes _ had sprouted the
makeshift memorials that the good-hearted create at every disaster.
Flowers, votive candles, stuffed animals, ribbons and little
crosses dotted the beaches, and local folk who knew nobody on the
plane trudged out to stand before them.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives or friends of the dead came slowly, later, after
they had a day or two to absorb the mental blow. Some took boats to
the crash site, dropped flowers in the water, prayed and wept as
dolphins leaped nearby under the brilliantly blue skies. Others
hugged on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Some came alone.
</P>
<P>
   Almost exactly 24 hours after Flight 261 spiraled into the
waves, Silverio Montoya came to Silver Strand Beach and gazed into
a golden sunset to say goodbye to his good friend, Marquez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan _ I call him Juanito,'' said Montoya, a Fresno resident
who works the Central Coast as a sales representative for a
textbook publisher. ``He had a big heart. Short stature, big
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Marquez and his life partner, Rettinger, sold adult-education
textbooks. They worked hard, flew often and relaxed whenever they
could at one of their two condos in Puerto Vallarta. It was from
one of those quick escapes that Marquez was returning, while
Rettinger stayed behind for a little while more in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya, 48, got the news when he cleared his voice mail while
biding his time on the tarmac at Los Angeles International. He was
coming home from a business trip to San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he could, Montoya drove to Port Hueneme to try to
find the spot where the plane went down and to make a video record
for all Marquez's friends.
</P>
<P>
   Surfers splashed in the foreground on breakers that rolled in
six at a time, eight feet high. Behind him, unaware that there was
someone here who actually knew someone on the plane, mourners set
bouquets in the sand while the setting sun haloed Anacapa Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody ever had a bad thing to say about Juan,'' Montoya said,
squinting into the setting sun.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped, and bit his lip. ``I'm sure everyone had their
stories,'' he said softly. ``You have to feel bad for all of them.
It's just so awful.''
</P>
<P>

DelVecchio and Stacy Finz, and written by Fagan. Also contributing

 GOLF BALLS THAT STAY PUT TO PUTT  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH _ With all the high-tech golf gimmicks pouring onto
the market, it's a shame that the scientists have missed a simple
innovation that could have saved play at Thursday's AT&AMP;T Pebble
Beach Pro-Am: heavier balls.
</P>
<P>
   Play was canceled before noon because the wind was blowing balls
around the greens. Had players been able to putt with my (patent
pending) two-pound Maxsquat, everything would have been cool.
</P>
<P>
   At a big-time golf tournament, tradition dictates that play be
suspended only for one of three reasons:
</P>
<P>
   --Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   --Flooded greens.
</P>
<P>
   --Tiger Woods oversleeping.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday it was simply too windy. I hiked out to the 18th
green and the wind blew away my parrot and eye patch. Golf was
invented for bad weather, but the problem here is that over the
past couple decades, tournaments have gone to shorter and shorter
grass on the greens, and the shorter the grass, the more the wind
will blow balls around, and golfers hate it when they have to chase
their balls around the greens.
</P>
<P>
   Greenskeepers used to put their mowers on the ``medium''
setting, then they dialed down to ``short,'' then ``kiwi fuzz,''
then ``Andre Agassi's five o'clock shadow.''
</P>
<P>
   A RAINOUT: That's what you get for sticking a golf course right
next to an ocean full of water.
</P>
<P>
   But as folks who live here on the Monterey Peninsula say (I'm
guessing), ``You've got to learn to take the good with the great.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know who lives in the homes that are perched on the
cliffs and tucked 'midst the cypresses in the Del Monte Forest, but
they're doing OK. It's old money here, pre-dot-com dough.
</P>
<P>
   The estates all have gates and high walls and fences, maybe
moats and drawbridges, and you wonder if they're trying to keep
people out or in.
</P>
<P>
   I did some window shopping, just in case my lottery numbers come
in. You can pick up a place called Casa de Suenos (House of
Dreams), which looks like a William Randolph Hearst starter kit,
overlooking the Pebble Beach course, for $9.5 mil.
</P>
<P>
   Like most estates advertised for sale here, Casa de Suenos has
``sweeping vistas,'' which is Spanish for ``dramatic views of
servants with brooms cleaning your driveway.''
</P>
<P>
   CARMEL ITSELF is much less exclusive. You can pick up a decent
cottage for a couple mil.
</P>
<P>
   Carmel, of course, is the world's cutest town. And clean. If you
toss down a candy wrapper, Dirty Harry will fire a warning shot
into your leg.
</P>
<P>
   Carmel has no curbs, no above-ground utility wires and no street
addresses. All mail is delivered by carrier pigeons who have been
potty-trained.
</P>
<P>
   Clint Eastwood, though no longer the mayor of Carmel, is still a
big presence here.
</P>
<P>
   ``He drives like an old man,'' one of the locals told me.
</P>
<P>
   And that's probably a good thing. Do you really want your
leading citizen driving around like a young hoodlum hopped up on
hootch?
</P>
<P>
   CLINT OWNS the Mission Ranch, an old-time Carmel resort with a
restaurant-bar where the locals hang out.
</P>
<P>
   The piano bar at the Ranch is the unofficial tournament
headquarters of Bill Murray when he plays the AT&AMP;T (he skipped this
one). Murray, they say, will have a cocktail or 14 and dominate the
microphone, horribly off-key, and everyone loves it.
</P>
<P>
   A piano bar regular told me a little about Carmel's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stationed at (nearby) Fort Ord, and this was a wild
place,'' he said. ``Pimps would drive into the parking lot pulling
trailers loaded with girls, and park right over there and set up
shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the only hookers lurking around Mission Ranch are Clint's
golfing buddies. It's funny that the town doesn't do more to
spotlight its colorful heritage. Who would have thunk it? Carmel:
Home of the port-a-pimp.
</P>
<P>
   NOW CARMEL-by-the-Sea is expanding away from the sea, into the
Carmel Valley, one of the state's 473 burgeoning wine regions.
Luxury lodges are popping up out in the Valley, like the posh
Bernardus, home of the 10-pound bath towel.
</P>
<P>
   ANY DAY NOW the rain will let up and we'll get back to doing
what we all came here to do: Standing on our tippy-toes and
stretching our necks to get a glimpse of Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   It's mind-boggling that millions of people play golf seriously,
and hundreds of pros play it magically, and yet one man is so
clearly the best player alive.
</P>
<P>
   What's Tiger's secret? Maybe he out-works the other guys. I
asked a few of the tour caddies who the hardest-working golfer is,
and they all said it's Vijay Singh, who happens to be one stroke
off the early lead here.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the hardest working golfer might be Jerry Rice.
Wednesday, Rice worked hard at the range, then played in (and won)
the Celebrity Shootout, then played 18 practice holes, then asked
his friend, Bill Miller, ``Where's a driving range with lights?''

 A CHALLENGE TO N.Y. LAW ON WINE SHIPMENTS  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a case that could have wide ramifications for
consumers, for California wineries and for Internet commerce, a
libertarian advocacy group filed suit Thursday in New York
challenging a state law that bans direct shipments of wine to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed by the nonprofit Institute for Justice,
challenges New York laws that restrict alcohol shipments from
outside the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case has the Supreme Court written all over it,'' said
the institute's vice president, John Kramer, who announced the suit
at a Washington press conference. Calling the institute's effort
``uncorking freedom,'' Kramer said such laws unconstitutionally
restrict both free speech and interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly the kind of case the Supreme Court typically
addresses and, in this case, needs to address,'' Kramer said, ``and
that's where we expect it to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is being watched especially closely by the Internet
industry, which argues that the direct-shipment restrictions could
set a precedent for much wider regulation of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty states currently ban direct shipments of alcoholic
beverages to consumers, and seven have made such acts a felony.
These states argue that the 21st Amendment, which granted states
regulatory authority over alcohol in exchange for lifting
Prohibition, helps them block minors from getting access to liquor.
</P>
<P>
   Winemakers counter that the states are using that power to grant
monopolies to local liquor distributors, violating the
Constitution's interstate commerce clause, which requires free
trade among the states.
</P>
<P>
   Institute legal director Clint Bolick said wine prices are 18 to
25 percent higher than they should be in states that require sales
to go through wholesalers rather than directly to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has become a major battle in Congress, with California
lawmakers waging an uphill fight against legislation that would
crack down on direct wine shipments.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is sponsored by Senator Orrin Hatch, a
Republican from Utah, which has some of the strictest temperance
laws in the nation, and Rep. Joe Scarborough, a Republican from
Florida, home to the nation's largest liquor wholesaler.
</P>
<P>
   ``That legislation will be rendered irrelevant if we succeed,''
Bolick predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer said the group is acting independently of the Wine
Institute, the San Francisco winemaker group, which also is
fighting direct shipping restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The Wine Institute typically challenges economic regulations
that inhibit free commerce for small businesses and consumers; it
recently won a court victory against the state of California over
cosmetology licensing requirements that were found to discriminate
against African American hair stylists.
</P>
<P>
   After the press conference, C. Boyden Gray, former White House
counsel in the Bush administration and now representing liquor
wholesalers for a top Washington law firm, told reporters that
legal precedents doom the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, who formerly was a vocal advocate of economic deregulation
and still sits on the board of the Reason Foundation, a libertarian
ally of the Institute for Justice, denied that state laws inhibit
consumer access to boutique wines.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said new online wine retailers are working with wholesalers
to find ways to ship wine legally, adding that consumers ``just
have to go through a local distributor.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray conceded that many small wineries do not have access to
distributors, but argued that ``eventually the system will catch
up.''

SEARCHERS RECOVER DATA RECORDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON KANDEL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
  LOS ANGELES _ Investigators recovered the second black-box
recorder from Alaska Airlines Flight 261 on Thursday and located
the horizontal stabilizer suspected of causing the plane to plunge
into the ocean off Port Hueneme, officials said.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Alaska Airlines crew struggled to fix the jammed pitch
stabilizer while losing altitude, they radioed mechanics at Los
Angeles International Airport in desperation before the plane
flipped upside down and nose-dived into the ocean Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A mechanic thought he heard a crew member say, ``We are in a
worse situation than we were,'' said John Hammerschmidt, a member
of the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary analysis of the flight voice recorder, found
Wednesday, has revealed the crew fought frantically to regain
control but eventually the plane flipped and spiraled before
crashing into the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crew made references to being inverted,'' National
Transportation Safety Board Chairman James Hall said in Washington,
referring to the contents of the recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Thursday, investigators said they have proved false
earlier reports that a different crew aboard the MD-83 had problems
with the same stabilizer en route to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilots reported the plane to be in normal working
condition with no malfunctions, and that condition was reported to
the crew of Flight 261,'' Hammerschmidt said. ``The bottom line is
that (in) two previous flight legs, everything was reported fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Of key interest to searchers is the horizontal stabilizer, which
now lies about 700 feet under the Santa Barbara Channel, about nine
miles from Point Mugu.
</P>
<P>
   A member of a Navy crew using specialized equipment reported
seeing part of the horizontal and vertical stabilizers as
comprising the largest piece of the wreckage outside of the
fuselage, Hammerschmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   The Alaska Airlines Eskimo logo was visible on the tail.
</P>
<P>
   Among the larger pieces of fuselage was one spanning four to
five windows. Other pieces of the plane are five to six feet in
length. Most are less than three feet.
</P>
<P>
   Also found was the log book for Flight 261, which investigators
hope will provide some detail about what might have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found the voice and data recorders in close
proximity on hard-packed ocean floor. The flight data recorder was
en route to Washington, D.C., on Thursday, and officials are
expected to have a readout of the data by this morning.
</P>
<P>
   The data recorder, if it is still operational, will provide
information about the plane's speed, heading, longitudinal vertical
and lateral acceleration, and the stabilizer pitch and trim
positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A whole array of different information,'' Hammerschmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with mechanics at LAX indicated the extent to which
the crew went while in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the mechanic was contacted by the crew over an open
frequency, the mechanic asked the crew if they had tried various
troubleshooting methods available to them,'' Hammerschmidt said.
``They said they had. The crew had asked the mechanic if he knew of
any hidden circuit breakers.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the crew said they had just had a ``horizontal stabilizer
runaway in the nose down position.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they have figured out that an electrical
short caused problems with a stabilizer trim on an American
Airlines MD-83 jetliner that had been grounded Wednesday in
Phoenix. ``They were unable to trim the nose up, but they could
move the stabilizer nose in a down position intermittently,''
Hammerschmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has been fixed and the plane is now ``fully
controllable in flight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether NTSB officials were advising Alaska Airlines
to check stabilizers on MD-83s, Hammerschmidt said, ``We are not
... currently, no.''
</P>
<P>
   Another focus of the search now will be to remove human remains,
Hammerschmidt said. The Navy ship Independence, scheduled to leave
Port Hueneme on Thursday evening, has the ability to remove human
remains and wreckage from the ocean bottom. The ship is expected to
be out two to three days.

DUCHESNE DERIDED AT STAPLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Detroit defenseman Steve Duchesne should not have
wondered it he was going to get booed. Every time the former Los
Angeles King touched the puck Thursday night, the Staples Center
crowd was merciless.
</P>
<P>
   Memories are fresh about the three-year contract worth up to $15
million in incentives that the club had to eat last February before
it could trade Duchesne to the Philadelphia Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   Duchesne, who signed with Detroit last summer, played 60 games
for the Kings last season with four goals and 19 assists. It was
the first of three seasons on his contract, which guaranteed $12
million with $3 million in incentives. But he played poorly and
quickly fell out of favor with former coach Larry Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Duchesne, who has rebounded to have a solid season (8 goals, 24
assists), believes the Kings used him as a scapegoat for their
disappointing 32-45-5 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Larry or the organization handled it very
well,'' Duchesne said. ``They said I played lousy. A lot of guys
played lousy.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaking up: The Kings scattered after Thursday night's game for
the three-day All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Blake went to the game in Toronto, where he is a starting
defenseman for the North American team.
</P>
<P>
   Ziggy Palffy, Jozef Stumpel, Stephane Fiset and Jaroslav Modry
are headed to Las Vegas for a little vacation. Coach Andy Murray is
going back to his home in Minnesota to watch his kids play hockey.
</P>
<P>
   The team will reassemble Monday at their new training facility
in El Segundo to prepare for perhaps their toughest month of the
season. Included is a stretch of seven games in 11 days on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   They open Tuesday with a home game against the Mighty Ducks,
then fly after the game to Phoenix to play the Pacific
Division-leading Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've learned a lot in the past six weeks that will
help us through a very difficult stretch,'' Kings coach Andy Murray
said. ``We have gotten most of our team back from injuries and that
will help.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Kings return from trip, which begins Feb.. 16 in
Chicago and ends on the 26th in San Jose, they will have just seven
road games the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Injury Update: Second-line winger Donald Audette continued to
favor his sprained left ankle during practice and Murray said it
could at least two weeks before Audette returns.... Defenseman
Philippe Boucher, sidelined all season after undergoing two
operations on his right foot, began skating this week, but Murray
said there is a chance he could be back for the final month.

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
There was one piece of business the Rockets could not squeeze into
their marathon halftime ceremony Thursday. Clyde Drexler Day was
not quite complete.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rather than leaving the festivities to the speeches and a
retired jersey, the Rockets re-enacted the glory days that put No.
22 into the Compaq Center rafters.
</P>
<P>
   Drexler did not wear the old uniform for a last reminder. But
suddenly, it was 1995 again.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets got a vintage stretch from Hakeem Olajuwon. They did
just enough in a hold-your-breath finish. And a shooting guard
turned himself into a do-everything blur as the Rockets beat the
Philadelphia 76ers 109-106.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets could not slow Allen Iverson until the final
seconds. But they found an answer by posting up Shandon Anderson,
with a six-inch height advantage, against the league's leading
scorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're different players, but Shandon was just great,''
Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said, referring to the former
Rockets guard celebrated at halftime and the Rockets guard who
carried the rest of the day. ``I can't tell you how great. He was
all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson responded with a career-best 32 points, repeatedly
producing big plays when the Rockets struggled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a coincidence that it happened like that,'' Anderson
said of his career night falling on Clyde Drexler Day. ``He's a guy
I looked to. It's nice it happened on the night they retired his
jersey. The way he played the game, going coast to coast and
posting guys up. Tonight, my game mirrored his.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's post-up game got him started, though eventually he
was scoring on the break and from the 3-point line as regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that they were going to do that,'' Iverson said. ``The
double (-team) wasn't arriving fast enough. He was able to get his
shot off. A guy 6-5, 6-6 can shoot over me any time he wants to. I
tried to keep him out of the lane, but he's much stronger than me.
Tonight it didn't matter what I did. He just played an excellent
game.''
</P>
<P>
   But it would not have been enough if Olajuwon's game did not
mirror his game of five seasons ago. He could not make that return
to glory last. He played 23 minutes before making way for another
outstanding defensive showing from Kelvin Cato down the stretch.
But Olajuwon made seven of nine shots, most with throwback moves,
to score 14 points, his most since his return.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I was playing without pain anywhere,''
Olajuwon said. ``My conditioning, my balance, it all felt so good.
I had a lot of opportunities that I was able to take advantage of.
When you're struggling to breathe, you can't even think, let alone
do anything out there. I was just glad tonight not to be dying. I
think I got my second wind finally.''
</P>
<P>
   But Iverson, whose 40 points matched the most scored against the
Rockets this season, would not let the Rockets rest.
</P>
<P>
   Despite leading by as many as 16 in the second half, the Rockets
could not take the win until the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   With the Rockets leading by three with less than a minute left,
Iverson took a wide-open 3, forcing Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich
to turn from the court rather than watch. But Iverson missed, and
Cato made two free throws to push the lead back to five.
</P>
<P>
   Theo Ratliff, who had 25 points to tie his season high, nailed a
jumper with 31.3 seconds left, and again the 76ers sent Cato to the
line. And again, Cato, a 60-percent free-throw shooter this season,
made both free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson nailed a nine-footer to keep the 76ers within a few
missed free throws. This time, with Steve Francis out of the game
with a strained groin, the 76ers fouled Bryce Drew, who had missed
his only two shots of the game and had not taken a free throw. Drew
made both with 13.6 seconds left for a 108-103 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, this is my first time in this spot in a long
time,'' Drew said. ``I definitely was a little nervous out there. I
hadn't been in that situation in a long time, since college.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 76ers would not let the Rockets relax. Eric Snow nailed
a 3 to pull the Sixers within 108-106. The Rockets inbounded to
Cato, who was fouled. He missed his first free throw but nailed the
second, allowing Anderson to foul Iverson rather than let him
launch another trey for a tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``My shooting has been a little suspect,'' Cato said. ``I tried
to accommodate (his wrist injury) by shooting with more arc.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wanted the ball. I said, `Just throw it up, and I'll get
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson missed his first free throw and clanged the second
intentionally. When Cato slapped the ball upcourt, the Rockets
could celebrate the occasion with a win.
</P>
<P>
   Just like old times.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a really big win against a very good team,''
Tomjanovich said of the Rockets' ninth win in 12 games. ``Iverson
is really something, something special. He makes great shots under
duress. I feel very fortunate to add another win. We made big free
throws. Dream was great. Cato was great late. And Shandon was
phenomenal. He did it in a lot of different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitting for the occasion, it looked familiar.

L.A. KIDS MORE FIT THAN MOST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
  LOS ANGELES _ Most students in body-conscious Los Angeles scored
better on most physical fitness tests than many of their peers
statewide, according to a state report released Thursday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their abdominal strength rocked, besting state averages in the
grades tested _ fifth, seventh and ninth. Their relative lack of
body fat ruled.
</P>
<P>
   But their overall health? That's different.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of Los Angeles Unified students didn't meet
all the standards the state sets for fitness, even though they
fared well on individual tests measuring strength and flexibility.
While few California students met all the standards, the statewide
percentage was still higher than Los Angeles', although possibly
because many LAUSD students didn't take all the tests.
</P>
<P>
   State and school district officials offered different
explanations for Los Angeles' uneven performance.
</P>
<P>
   But they agreed that students need to put down the mouse or
joystick and spend more time on exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The computer age has grabbed so many of these kids,'' said
Steve Franklin, the physical education department chairman at
Parkman Middle school in Woodland Hills. ``The hand dexterity is
fantastic, but the average kid is not getting out.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, teen-age America's fitness problem began long before
the arrival of the iMac. Studies by the Harvard School of Public
Health show that since the 1960s, obesity in 6- to 11-year-olds has
increased more than 50percent, while obesity in 12- to 17-year-olds
has increased more than 40percent.
</P>
<P>
   The scores released Thursday come from physical fitness tests
mandated by state law. Each year, children in grades five, seven
and nine are checked for their aerobic capacity, body composition,
flexibility, abdominal strength, upper-body strength and trunk
strength. The results are released every two years.
</P>
<P>
   On most individual tests, students in the Los Angeles Unified
School District topped state averages. More than 84 percent of
local ninth-graders, for example, met state expectations for
abdominal strength, compared with 79.5 percent statewide. And 63.2
percent of LAUSD ninth-graders had adequately buff upper bodies,
compared to 60.5 throughout California.
</P>
<P>
   But only 12.2 percent of local ninth-graders passed all six
tests. The statewide figure for ninth-graders stood at 19.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The picture we see is not what we hoped it would be,'' said
Delaine Eastin, state superintendent of public instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles school officials also noted that not all of the
district's students took all of the tests. In grade five, for
example, 5,373 more children took the body composition test than
the upper body strength exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do them all in one day, so if you've got a large
group of kids rotating through, you may not finish them all,'' said
testing coordinator Paula Moseley.
</P>
<P>
   Les Axelrod, a research and evaluation consultant for the state
education department, said Los Angeles Unified's overall scores
could reflect students who have mastered one kind of exercise, but
not another.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could have good aerobic capacity, but you may not have
good upper body strength,'' he said. ``Overall, the kids aren't
doing too bad, but we only consider a kid to be fit if it's six out
of six.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Moseley was encouraged by Los Angeles' showing on
individual tests, Moseley echoed Franklin's concern.
</P>
<P>
   Too many young people have devolved into Internet potatoes, she
said. Parents need to make sure their children get involved in some
kind of after-school or weekend exercise, even if it isn't the
traditional baseball or soccer league. Gym class alone won't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have students who need to go outside, play, ride bicycles
and run,'' Moseley said.

   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA-PRESS (Grozny, Russia) _ Two struggles are under
way in Chechnya: a bloody fight between the Russian military and
thousands of Islamic separatist rebels and a more subtle tug-of-war
between the Russian high command and the nation's media. Every day
Russia's journalists do battle with the military press service,
which regulates access to the battlefield and is determined to put
out the message that the Kremlin's war is going according to plan.
So far, the military has the upper hand. By Michael R. Gordon.

   FLA-AFFIRM (Miami) _ From school vouchers to the death penalty,
Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida has had one political success after
another in his first year in office. But his sweeping program to

some who supported him, and looms as the first real test of his

enforcement campaign, to be announced by President Clinton on
Friday, will use information developed by the firearms bureau in
tracing guns used in crimes. By Fox Butterfield.

   VODAPHONE-DUSSELDORF (Dusseldorf, Germany) _ Had it not been in
large part for Mannesmann AG, this old industrial city might well
have suffered a decline similar to that of Detroit. Just as
Mannesmann re-invented itself from a producer of seamless steel
pipe to a fast-growing telecommunications company, Dusseldorf has
re-invented itself a prosperous center of high technology and
services. Now the most important company in the city is now
succumbing to the $170 billion hostile takeover by a British
company that seems intent on running the company from London. Yet
business executives and even political leaders here seem to share
an overwhelming view that there is no turning back. To the extent
that Dusseldorf and Mannesmann have achieved a new prosperity, they
have done so by tapping into international trade and international
capital markets. By Edmund L. Andrews.

far-flung places offers easy transport to distant lands and times.

   MET-EVANS-PHOTOS (New York) _ ``His general note is lyrical
understanding of the street, trained observation of it, special
feeling for patina, eye for revealing detail, over all of which is
thrown a poetry.'' That's the photographer Walker Evans, writing in
1931 about Atget. Later, lecturing in 1964 about Atget and also
about Mathew Brady, another hero, he projected a group of the penny
picture postcards he had collected since he was a child. ``Can you
imagine anything more?'' he asked his audience about his anonymous
little hand-colored images of small-town main streets and trolley
cars. ``A conglomeration of hideous things that come together by
casting a spell of _ I can't call it beauty, but of a certain kind
of silent poetry.'' Twice, poetry. That was what Evans was after in
his own photographs, a poetry that you couldn't call beauty, not
conventional beauty anyway, an art inspired by vernacular subjects
and aspiring to the natural dignity of the street. As the Met's
excellent new retrospective of him reiterates, to the end of his
life (he died in 1975, at 72), Evans had this goal, which in his
case became a distinctly American project. By Michael Kimmelman.

   NEW-ENGLAND-CAMPUSES (Undated) _ When winter comes to other
cities of the world, like Helsinki or St. Petersburg, where snows
fall almost daily, the hushed atmosphere of the streets in their
winter whiteness is broken only by the muffled sounds of city life.
Magical winters like these are so rare in New York City that they
form precious memories for people who treasure bundling up for the
adventure in the otherwise quiet month of February before the
awakening of spring. But there is no need to pine. Skiers are not
the only ones who can travel to find ideal snow conditions. For
people whose favorite winter sport is not skiing but hiking along
woodland paths or simply walking on streets in a small town after a
blizzard, to recapture the crunch of snow underfoot that so quickly
disappears in the city, the best choice is to journey to a
university or college town in New England. By Paula Deitz.

SHAQ STEAMS OVER RICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Trade rumors may or may not be affecting the
Lakers' Glen Rice, but they are certainly aggravating Shaquille
O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Rice has scored just 12 points combined over the past two games.
He insists he's not pressing or bothered by speculation he'll be
dealt by the Feb. 24 trade deadline. O'Neal thinks otherwise, and
thinks he knows who's responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish you guys would just leave him alone and let him play
his game,'' O'Neal lectured reporters Thursday. ``I'm concerned
about Glen because you guys keep messing with him, like you guys
messed with Eddie (Jones). ...
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was on the trading block, I would just want to hear about
it one day. But you guys write about it every day. He has to see
it. He sees it, his family sees it, his kids see it. Excuse my
French, but you guys are (bleeping) him up. Yeah, you guys. Just
say it one time.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone pointed out it was Lakers management that left Jones
dangling for weeks before trading him for Rice last March. And it
is the Laker front office that now is deciding whether Rice will
stay or go.
</P>
<P>
   Said O'Neal: ``The front office didn't tell the drill sergeant
(O'Neal) that. You guys are the bad guys, not Jerry (West). You
guys keep messing with him. It's probably hard on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice said he's ignoring the trade talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to perform better regardless,'' he said. ``Like I said,
if I'm going to be traded, I'm going to be traded. If not, then
I'll continue to be here. That's not my judgment call there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice has struggled with his jump shot the past two games and has
been upset over both scoring opportunities and playing time _ he
was benched for two quarters at San Antonio on Tuesday. Rice said
he hasn't discussed the matter with coach Phil Jackson, and he
avoided the issue Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was upset because we went out there and we lost, and that's
about all I'm going to speak on,'' he said. ``Of course, any player
wants to be out there on the floor, and one of the things that I'm
just going to try and do is just go out there and continue to stay
aggressive, regardless of how many shots I get.''
</P>
<P>
   Shake it up: With the Lakers in a tailspin that has seen them
lose six of their past nine games and slip out of first place in
the Pacific Division, Jackson is considering potential changes to
the lineup and the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm considering almost all those things,'' he said.
``I'm considering starting it (Friday, against the Utah Jazz)....
We just have to try to shake things up a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to elaborate.

<P>
   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
JULIUS Erving to Clyde Drexler.
</P>
<P>
   Some connections are obvious.
</P>
<P>
   The Doctor could fly. Clyde could glide. The Doctor was silk.
Clyde was velvet.
</P>
<P>
   The giant replay screens at both ends of the court at one point
Thursday night showed Drexler driving the baseline against the
Lakers, cruising under the basket past A.C. Green and using reverse
English to spin the ball off the glass for a hoop.
</P>
<P>
   It was reminiscent of the 1980 Finals and a play _ maybe the
most magical of all time in the NBA _ when Erving climbed an
invisible ladder along the baseline against the Lakers, past Mark
Landsberger, past Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, elevating, levitating,
captivating, dangling in the air until coming out on the other side
of the backboard and spinning the ball off the glass and into the
hghlight reels and memory banks.
</P>
<P>
   Both were as ferociously competitive on the court as hungry pit
bulls. Dr. J's nostrils would flare. Clyde's eyes would get that
laser-beam glint that could cut through steel.
</P>
<P>
   Similarities. Connections. Some not so obvious.
</P>
<P>
   On the night when Clyde the Glide's No. 22 jersey took its place
in the rafters with Moses Malone's No. 24, Calvin Murphy's No. 23
and Rudy T's No. 45 at halftime of a win over the Sixers, there
were homages paid and jokes jabbed good-naturedly.
</P>
<P>
   There was a star-studded cast that ranged from his college
coach, Guy V. Lewis, to his first pro coach, Jack Ramsay, to his
former Portland teammates, Kiki Vandeweghe and Buck Williams, to
his longtime Houston buddy, Hakeem Olajuwon. Mostly, they told
stories and they remembered.
</P>
<P>
   But at a private reception before the game, Erving spoke of a
deeper, more profound connection, so significant because of his own
status. Because as the total package _ the player, the showman, the
icon, the gentleman, the ambassador _ there is Dr. J and then there
is everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is another kind of torch that is passed,'' he said,
``one that involves more than just playing. It's about
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a sophomore in college at Massachusetts, a famous
player came to our campus to give a speech. When the speech was
over, he asked me if I wanted to go out with him and get a cup of
coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I went and those several hours that I sat there listening
to and salivating just over the idea that I was with him changed my
life. I was a wide-eyed kid, and that experience was a dream come
true. That player was Bill Russell, and all through my career he
was a big brother to me. We talked all the time, and he counseled
me. He taught about being a professional on the court and off it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the type of torch that I want to tell you passed
between myself and Clyde Drexler. Our careers never overlapped when
we were in our prime, and maybe that's why we could have our
relationship. If we had both been in our prime at the same time,
we'd have been trying to school each other. And then you don't go
out to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Clyde was a young player learning when I was coming to the
end, and there were times in those years when we'd be on the court
together and I could feel him looking. I could sense that he was
trying to see something, trying to pick up on little things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to myself then, `He may not know or may not want it,
but I'm his big brother now.'''
</P>
<P>
   The hero worship that had grown since Clyde was a kid trying to
duplicate the moves of Dr. J on the playgrounds of Houston
eventually grew into firm, unbreakable bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I met him, I was in shock,'' Drexler said.
``Hakeem and I met him at a Rockets game. Just to have Julius talk
to me, to say hi, was a thrill. To think that I would eventually
develop a relationship with him, it was beyond my wildest dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   They have always kept in touch by phone, usually the mentor
dialing up the student. Erving would offer advice, philosophy or
sometimes just listen. Dr. J in retirement would occasionally come
to Houston and they'd play a round of golf, spend time together.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing specific. No agendas. No main topics. Just any topic
that one of the all-time greats could discuss with a kid who would
become one of the all-time greats. The hero had become the bedrock
to the kid, the foundation to his professionalism, proof that even
role models can have role models.
</P>
<P>
   ``One night early in my career during one of our conversations,
I asked Julius how he did it every night,'' Drexler said. ``I mean,
it's an 82-game season and playoffs, and he was always out there
being the Doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me there's always some guy, some kid, who is in that
arena that night and he's heard all about you and now he's seeing
you in person for the first time. You don't want that guy going
away from that game saying you didn't deliver. You have to leave
him with a memory.''
</P>
<P>
   It was about pride, a sense of self.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to give Clyde the sense of what Bill Russell has
always meant to me,'' said Erving. ``A guy who always stood for
something instead of going for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   There were cheers and applause and flowers and video highlights
Thursday night. There were family and friends and a city that
always embraced him.
</P>
<P>
   But on the night when he was saluted, this was the ultimate
honor from within the game.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Russell to Julius Erving to Clyde Drexler. A deeper
connection, a different kind of torch.

STANFORD BEATS UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two hours before tipoff Thursday night, UCLA
senior Sean Farnham strolled across the Pauley Pavilion floor,
smile and spirit in tow. But when someone asked about Farnham's
locker-room tirade after UCLA's lossat Oregon, his grin
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The true test of whether it did any good or not,'' Farnham
said, ``will be how we play tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   By that standard, Farnham's wall-banging harangue was a failure.
The Bruins never had a chance against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that's not true. They had a chance for four minutes,
at which point Stanford took a 10-point lead and the game was over.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins trailed by 16 at halftime and 20 early in the second
half. A brief rally midway through the second half enabled them to
avoid complete embarrassment. The final score _ 78-63 _ was an
accurate reflection of Stanford's dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Jason Kapono led UCLA with 21 points. Stanford freshman
Casey Jacobsen scored 17 in his first appearance in Pauley since
scoring 43 for Glendora High in the Martin Luther King Dream
Classic 55 weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins spent much of the game in a zone defense, which
forced Stanford to shoot from the perimeter. (It did, making 6 of
10 3-pointers in the decisive first half.) If the Bruins extended
to cover the shooters, Stanford passed the ball inside for layups
and short jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the game, UCLA's offense was helpless against
Stanford's smothering defense, which leads the nation in field-goal
percentage allowed. Only the individual talent of Kapono and
forward Jerome Moiso (12 points) got the Bruins into the 60s.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had the momentum for about five minutes of the second
half and they quickly cut the 20-point deficit in half with baskets
on six consecutive possessions. Earl Watson's jumper from the right
wing with 14 minutes left trimmed Stanford's lead to 49-41. But the
Cardinal,behind Jacobsen, regained its rhythm and quickly regained
control.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat was UCLA's fifth in its last nine games and dropped
the Bruins to 12-7 overall and 3-5 in the conference. Now they must
win six of their last 11 to reach the 18-win plateau that probably
would secure an NCAA Tournament bid.
</P>
<P>
   (In the last four years, all 14 Pac-10 teams with at least 18
wins and a .500 or better league mark have made the tournament.)
</P>
<P>
   But winning six of 11 won't be easy, not the way UCLA has played
lately. The most realistic scenario is to count three games as
victories (Oregon State, Washington and Washington State at home)
and three as defeats (Syracuse, Arizona and Stanford on the road).
That means the Bruins must win three of five games against Cal
(twice), USC (home), Oregon (home) and Arizona State (road).
</P>
<P>
   They'll have to make a better showing than they did Thursday.
Then again, given UCLA's performance against Stanford in recent
years _ and against the top teams in the Pac-10 this season _ the
outcome was not a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal had defeated UCLA in five of the previous six
games, with 62 points separating the teams. Stanford's 48-point
thrashing in Maples Pavilion three years ago skewed the
differential but only slightly: The Cardinal had two other
double-digit victories, including a 13-point win in Pauley last
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins also played poorly against the three teams that were
tied with Stanford atop the conference _ losing to Arizona, USC and
Oregon by an average of 14 points per game. Including Thursday's
game, the Bruins are 0-4 against the league's best and they've been
outscored by 57 points.

CAL BEATS USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The broken bones USC has somehow refused to
acknowledge through its marvelous Pacific-10 Conference run finally
proved too much to ignore Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, seldom-used Rashad Jones would not be taking a shot
with 26.5 seconds left. Or true freshman Nate Hair would not shoot
a 3-pointer in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, USC went scoreless for the final 72 seconds
and lost to California 66-62 before 5,587 at the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans were flat for most of the game and, for the first
time this season, looked like a team that is without its leading
scorer (Sam Clancy) or sixth man (Jarvis Turner).
</P>
<P>
   ``Every phase of the game, they outplayed us,'' USC coach Henry
Bibby said. ``They were more physical, quicker, they executed. They
deserved to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Trojans had a chance to win this game, despite making
only 3 of 20 shots from 3-point range. That's a far cry from the
Pac-10 record 20 3-pointers they made last week against Oregon
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I guess you see what the 3-pointer is like,'' Bibby said.
``You're not going to shoot it well every game.''
</P>
<P>
   USC's 15 percent on 3-pointers was a season low.
</P>
<P>
   But the Trojans trailed 63-62 with a minute remaining and had
the ball. That's when Jones, who had not shot the entire game and
has not scored a point in Pac-10 play, drove to the basket. He was
tied up by Cal's Dennis Gates and Nick Vander Laan for a jump ball
and the Bears took possession.
</P>
<P>
   Gates was fouled with 24.6 seconds remaining and made one of two
free throws to give Cal a 64-62 lead. The Trojans (13-7, 6-2) had a
chance to tie the game. Brandon Granville missed a 3-pointer with
21 seconds left, but USC got the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Granville was then stripped of the ball but tied up Vander Laan
for another jump ball. The Trojans had possession, but in the
closing seconds Hair took a 3-pointer that bounced off the rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stuff you dream about when you are a kid and the most
devastating feeling in the world to miss that shot,'' Hair said.
``I felt like I let everyone in the arena down. I just rushed it.
It was tight. It was a decent look, but I knew it was going to be
short.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact two players who have been in those situations were
taking the final shots showed how shorthanded the Trojans were,
especially after forward David Bluthenthal fouled out with 6:26
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Brian Scalabrine (25 points, nine rebounds), no other
Trojan had even a decent game. Bluthenthal, Trepagnier, Granville
and Hair were a combined 12 of 37 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine did not question who was taking the shots at the end
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a go-to guy on this team,'' he said. ``On this
team, whoever does best takes the shot. Whoever is open takes the
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, USC tied the game 55-55 on a 3-pointer by Hair, but
the Bears (12-8, 3-5) quickly responded with a driving shot by
Gates and a layup by Brian Wethers.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, it was clear the Trojans were not close to their
record- setting shooting performance against Oregon State. They
made only 1 of 10 3-pointers in the first half. Bluthenthal was
just 2 for 7 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   USC knew it was going to a long night after falling behind 7-0
at the outset. The Trojans regrouped to tie the score 13-13, but
Cal reeled off six straight points to open up another lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears took a 32-21 lead on a drive by Donte Smith with 3:27
remaining, but USC managed to close to halftime lead to four points
(34-30) after six straight points by Scalabrine.
</P>
<P>
   An alley-oop slam by Trepagnier gave USC a 40-38 lead with 14:40
left, its first lead of the contest. But Cal quickly recovered and
took a 46-42 lead on an 18-foot jumper by Shahar Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Cal boosted the lead to 50-43 on Sean Lampley's layup and things
got worse for the Trojans when Bluthenthal picked up his fourth
foul with 7:47 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Shantay Legans led Cal with 12 points while Vander Laan had 11.

NORTHRIDGE BEATS IDAHO STATE

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For almost a week, as they traveled to different
cities in different time zones, the Cal State Northridge men's
basketball players missed Andre Larry.
</P>
<P>
   He was their teammate and their friend. His sudden departure for
personal reasons created a somber mood, made even worse by an
embarrassing 21-point loss at Weber State.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after CSUN edged Idaho State 79-77 Thursday night at
Matador Gym, they know what life will be like without Larry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to miss (Larry) every time we step out on the
court,'' said junior center Brian Heinle, who continued his scoring
surge with a team-high 26 points. ``It's a big loss for our club.
Games are going to be like this now. Hopefully we can maintain our
edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry not only was CSUN's second-leading scorer when he quit; he
seemed to rise to the occasion when Northridge needed him. He made
the winning basket in Northridge's upset of Oregon in December and
just recently, he had a huge second half in CSUN's 10-point home
win over Montana State.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors, who improved to 6-3 in the Big Sky and 14-6
overall, were without a spark as Idaho State stayed close. They
didn't breathe easy until reserve guard Marco McCain made two free
throws with 12.9 seconds left to give CSUN a 79-75 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ISU (6-14, 1-8) cut the lead to two on Stephen Brown's two free
throws with five seconds left. But Northridge inbounded the ball
and avoided a foul to get its 10th consecutive home win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did what we needed to do at the end of the game,'' CSUN
coach Bobby Braswell said. ``We played great defense. Marco stepped
up to the free throw line and made two big free throws. At the end
of the season, all that matters is we got the win.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN is within percentage points of first in the Big Sky
standings, trailing Eastern Washington (5-2) and tied with Weber
State (6-3).
</P>
<P>
   Northridge only plays one game at Northern Arizona (10-9, 4-4)
in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the break right now,'' Braswell said. ``Our guys need
a rest. They need to get their legs back.''
</P>
<P>
   That seemed apparent Thursday night. The Bengals, who were blown
out 101-86 by Northridge at home on Jan. 8, fought back from a
14-point deficit (57-43) in the second half and actually took a
lead with 2 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   ISU seemed inspired by a technical foul on coach Doug Oliver
with 14:28 left. Heinle appeared to travel and palm the ball in the
same motion on a pass to Jeff Parris that ended in a fastbreak dunk
and a 55-43 Matadors lead.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver hopped up and down and finally got the technical he
wanted. McCain made both free throws.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals clawed back into it and a 10-2 run cut CSUN's lead
to 63-58 with 7:53 left. With 3 minutes left, the Bengals took
their first lead, 71-70 on Kevin Sweetwyne's driving layup.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, the Bengals looked dead. With 6 minutes left in
the first half, Heinle made a 3-pointer to give Northridge a 31-18
lead. But ISU closed the half on a 17-8 run and Northridge's
halftime lead was only four 39-35.
</P>
<P>
   Heinle had 12 rebounds to go with his points; he made nine of 17
shots in 34 minutes. Parris had 15 points in only 21 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know people are going to step up,'' CSUN guard Markus Carr
said. ``Sometimes you come out flat and you need to get yourselves
going. We're learning how to win.''

JOB SECURITY WEAK UNDER UN-STERLING OWNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The first round of the PGA Tour stop in Pebble
Beach was suspended by inclement weather Thursday and Los Angeles
Clippers coach Chris Ford was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Yawn. Those aren't news flashes, they're foregone conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever known storm clouds not to gather over the Monterey
Peninsula or the Clippers this time of the year?
</P>
<P>
   Don't fret for the golfers; they at least have rain gear and
umbrellas to protect them from Mother Nature's capriciousness. Pity
the poor skippers of the Clippers, who have absolutely nothing to
shelter themselves from Donald Sterling's reign.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise isn't that Ford was fired _ the Clippers go through
coaches the way NBA players go through sneakers _ but that he took
the job at all. He was drawing a paycheck from Milwaukee at the
time of his hiring, so it wasn't money that motivated him. He said
last year it was the challenge that proved irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   With only eight days to assemble a team before the start of last
year's truncated season, Ford faced a task on par with sucking up
the rainwater on Pebble Beach's greens using only a soda straw.
</P>
<P>
   He squeezed nine wins out of the 50-game schedule. This year the
Clippers were slightly ahead of their duffer's pace of 1999, with
11 wins in 45 games. But that wasn't sufficient progress, not
considering Ford had the Big Bertha of rookies in his bag in Lamar
Odom.
</P>
<P>
   The players complained they weren't getting enough direction.
Ford shouldered the blame for that when, in fact, the lack of
direction starts at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling waited until the lockout was a bitter memory to
authorize the hiring of a coach last year, the better to save
money. He balked at securing the services for seasons to come of
free-agent-to-be Maurice Taylor during the past offseason (the
better to save money?). He seems perfectly content to be a
third-class tenant in the Staples Center when his Clippers could be
lords of the manor in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   There's a four-letter word that comes to mind every time
Sterling swings into action: F-O-R-E.
</P>
<P>
   We're pretty sure Sterling has exhausted his supply of
mulligans. For the love of the game, we wish he'd take his leave of
the NBA. Why can't Sterling just sell a majority share of the team
to Magic Johnson, already?
</P>
<P>
   If his ego demands that he own a sports team, let Sterling run
this city's XFL team, once wrestling kingpin Vince McMahon works
out all the kinks in his planned football league.
</P>
<P>
   The more things don't change at the top, the more nothing
changes with the Clippers. Sterling is in his 19th season of
ownership. His right-hand man, Elgin Baylor, has been the vice
president of basketball operations since 1986, which is longer than
any other NBA executive save for the Lakers' Jerry West and the
Bulls' Jerry Krause.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the entrance to the Clippers' locker room has been a
revolving door. Since Sterling purchased the team, only 10 players
have stayed longer than a single presidential term. Eric
Piatkowski, bless his soul, needs to hang on just two more years
after this one to tie Loy Vaught's team endurance mark of eight
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of this season, we would have liked the odds of
Odom being a Clipper for life. In addition to his marvelous talent,
he brought something rarer still to the Clippers' dressing room:
rapture.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it took less than half a season to wipe that radiant smile
off Odom's face. By the end of the NBA's mandatory gestation
period, we expect he'll be as cranky as a colicky baby.
</P>
<P>
   The real crying shame is that the team can't throw out the Clip
Board with the coach.

KINGS ROUT RED WINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Kings ended the first half
Thursday night the way they hopeto play the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   They now head off to the All-Star break after scoring four goals
in the second period, including three within 90 seconds, to rout
the mighty Detroit Red Wings 6-3 in front of a sellout crowd of
18,118 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since Nov. 16 they have won two straight. The
Kings also got goals from each member of their first line. Ziggy
Palffy had two and Luc Robitaille, Jozef Stumpel had one apiece.
Bryan Smolinski and Glen Murray also scored.
</P>
<P>
   For Robitaille, whose goal gave the Kings a 4-2 lead, it was his
25th of the year and the 542nd of his career, moving him past Stan
Mikita into 19th place on the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to need those guys to win some games for us in the
second half,'' said coach Andy Murray, who now has six goals from
the first unit in the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not the New York Islanders, who were manhandled
bythe Kings 5-2 on Tuesday night. The Red Wings came in one point
behind St. Louis for the best record in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, however, have played them tough in their first two
meetings, a 1-1 tie Nov. 3 and a 3-1 loss on Dec. 10, both in
Detroit. After 48 games, the Kings (23-21-7)have 56 points and hold
the eighth and final playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the offensive flurry, it might have just been the Kings
night. Calgary, which entered the night just one point behind, was
tied in the final 10 seconds of regulation by the Chicago
Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's game started poorly when the Red Wings Sergei Fedorov
scored a short-handed goal with less than three minutes left in the
first period.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Lapointe was off for high sticking when Fedorov stole the
puck at center ice and beat Kings goaltender Stephane Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy tied the game just 1:45 into the second period with his
18th goal of the season and his 48th point in 47 games. Palffy now
has 379 career points in 377 games.
</P>
<P>
   But less than three minutes later, it was Fedorov again. Larry
Murphy began the play from behind the Detroit net with a long pass
down ice. Fedorov and Fiset raced for the puck and collided.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset hooked his left leg and went down. Fedorov tapped the puck
into the empty net for his 15th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   From there is was all Kings.
</P>
<P>
   They slowly took the game away from the Red Wings, who lost
Tuesday night in Phoenix after winning four straight.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings tied it at 12:57 when Stumpel stole a Chris Chelios
pass and beat Detroit goaltender Chris Osgood with a wrist shot to
the stick side.
</P>
<P>
   The prettiest and grittiest goal of the night came next. Rookie
Jason Blake, who has played the last three games on the second
line, dug the pug out of the corner and passed to Glen Murray
behind the Red Wings net.
</P>
<P>
   Murray quickly fired a pass to the slot when Smolinski ripped
slap shot through the legs of Osgood at 13:37. Robitaille made it
4-2 when Palffy dropped him the puck in front of the net at 14:17.
Robitaille, who grew up in Montreal, now trails his idol and
Canadien legend Maurice Richard (544) by two goals for 18th
all-time.
</P>
<P>
   Three goals in 90 seconds did not set a club record.
</P>
<P>
   On March 2, 1989, Steve Duchesne, Wayne Gretzky and Duchesne
again scored three goals in 41 seconds of the first period against
St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Duchesne was on the ice for the Red Wings Thursday. He was booed
repeatedly by the crowd after he failed to stick with the team
after signing a long and expensive contract in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   After signing Duchesne to a three-year $12 million contract that
included an extra $3 million incentives, the Kings were forced to
eat the contract before trading him to the Philadelphia Flyers last
February.

BRUINS BEST MAPLE LEAFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There have been many more low points than high points for the
Bruins this season, but one of the highs came Thursday night when
they went up against one of the league's best teams _ the Toronto
Maple Leafs _ and emerged with a 4-2 victory at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   It gave the Bruins a 2-1-1 mark in their last four games heading
into the All-Star break and moved them to within four games of .500
(18-22-14) with 28 left to play. More important, they gained
confidence in their home building (something that has been sorely
lacking) and now hope to finally put all the negative drama that
has plagued the team all season to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked the players to really stand up and be counted,'' said
coach Pat Burns. ``You could really see a different attitude in the
dressing room, too. You could see guys talking a little bit
different. It was good. I was almost confident before the game.''
</P>
<P>
   That confidence showed in his team as it built a 3-0 lead midway
through the game. The Maple Leafs of late have had a habit of
starting slowly then rallying. That again was true Thursday &UR;  &LR; night.
Though the Bruins were forced to weather a third-period storm, for
the most part they were in command.
</P>
<P>
   Boston got its first two goals less than four minutes apart in
the first period. Sergei Samsonov cashed in on the power play at
4:29 for his 12th goal of the season. Darren Van Impe started the
play by dumping the puck in from the left point. Samsonov finished
it when he made a nice move from the right circle and lifted a
backhand shot into the top right corner of the net past goalie
Curtis Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins made it a two-goal advantage on Cameron Mann's first
tally of the season. Mann had been summoned from Providence
Thursday morning after the club had indefinitely suspended right
wing Joe Murphy for insubordination.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was set up by a superb effort by Andre Savage. He
carried the puck down the left side, skated backward deep into the
circle, and waited out Tomas Kaberle. As the Toronto defenseman
moved toward Savage, he threaded the puck through the blueliner's
legs and right on the stick of Mann, who was charging down the
right side. Mann rapped it past Joseph for the 2-0 lead at 8:14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy playing with him,'' said Mann, who spent the bulk of
his time in Providence last season on a line with Savage. ``He's a
great passer. He protects the puck well, sees the ice really well,
and we just seem to click.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, Boston built on its lead at 11:33 with Joe
Thornton potting his 14th of the season. It was a fine individual
effort by Thornton, who shrugged off right wing Jonas Hoglund
behind the Toronto net and skated the puck out into the right
circle. Thornton curled around and flicked the puck at the net,
beating Joseph to give the Bruins a 3-0 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, Byron Dafoe faced 12 shots in the first 40
minutes but very few were legitimate scoring chances. The Maple
Leafs had three power plays in the first two periods but Boston's
penalty killing, which has been much maligned this season, killed
them off and held the Maple Leafs 0 for 4 on the night.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins got into a bit of trouble in the third. The Maple
Leafs, who seem to be masters of the comeback, tried it again.
Center Mats Sundin, who had been hot of late, broke through for
Toronto with his 25th goal of the season at 4:47. Steve Thomas,
positioned at the left point, dished a pass to Sundin in the slot.
Sundin fired it past Dafoe, who appeared to have been screened.
Less than two minutes later, the Maple Leafs pulled to within a
goal when right wing Mike Johnson drilled a slapper that caromed
off the skate of Kyle McLaren and past Dafoe to make it 3-2 at
6:26.
</P>
<P>
   McLaren closed it out with a 75-foot slap shot at 13:34, giving
the Bruins some needed breathing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get any of those in a while,'' said Burns, whose
team has been short on good fortune recently. ``Those make a big
difference.''

COMPETITORS FACE NEW NHRA RULES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA, Calif. _ The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the
few, or the one.
</P>
<P>
   That's how NHRA competitors feel about three new rules in place
beginning with this weekend's 40th Winternationals at Fairplex.
While most are not entirely enthusiastic about the changes in the
rulebook, they also know they are necessary for the future of the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought one of the worst things about drag racing
is the down time,'' said five-year Funny Car pilot Tony Pedregon.
``I think NHRA has approached that. A lot of guys don't like it,
but I tend to always look at the big picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's going to improve our television package, that's a good
thing. If it's going to keep our fans here to just 4 or 5 (p.m.),
that's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the rule changes:
</P>
<P>
   __In the professional Top Fuel and Funny Car classes, the
maximum allowable percentage of nitromethane will be 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   __A penalty, both loss of points and fines, will be imposed upon
race teams that oil down the track.
</P>
<P>
   __The interval between elimination rounds will be shortened from
90 to 75 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of the new rules was to improve our level of
performance to our fans,'' said former crew chief Ray Alley, the
NHRA's new director of Top Fuel and Funny Car racing. ``To give
them more racing and less oil- down time when they have to sit on
their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is focused to the safety and the satisfaction of
our race fans. When we draw the pyramid of what's important, our
fans are right at the top. When the fans are happy, they bring that
to their friends and then we all win.''
</P>
<P>
   None of these new rules has received more attention then the
limitation of the nitromethane percentage. This is a major step in
a sport that has often been perceived as the ``unlimited class.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This change was made because we had four major engine
explosions (in 1999),'' Alley said. ``It became apparent that the
crew chiefs' ability to create horsepower had exceeded the
components' ability to withstand it. So in consideration for the
safety of our fans and racers, we decided to pull the power back a
bit and let the parts catch up. Ninety percent does not mean 90
percent forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it mean a reduction in elapsed times and speeds. Most
believe crew chiefs will be able get some of that horsepower back
by making adjustments in compression and supercharger boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just going to change the way we tune the car,'' said Alan
Johnson, who despite the reduction tuned two-time Top Fuel champion
Gary Scelzi to a pair of 4.61-second and a pair of 321 mph runs in
preseason testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think early on, you're going to see a reduction. But
(reducing the nitro percentage), that's something the NHRA felt
they needed to do to try and make racing safer and make for a
better show.''
</P>
<P>
   But will it reduce the major explosions like Doug Herbert
experienced during the NHRA Finals last November?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you get together and take some nitro away doesn't
mean the oil-downs are going to go away,'' said 1999 Top Fuel
champion Tony Schumacher, who ran as fast as 330 mph in 1999.
``Everyone knows that everyone is going to raise compression. Now,
is it better to have less nitro or lower compression? We'll find
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the NHRA was going to introduce a ``spec'' fuel but
decided the responsibility of running 90 percent nitro should be on
the teams, who already have to deal with meeting a weight
limitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is not to penalize anybody,'' said Alley, who
will work with NHRA competition director Graham Light. ``But I'm
telling the teams that 90 percent is 90 percent, not 90.5 percent.
I'm advising them to try to run their car run on 89 percent because
if you have a little evaporation and you don't want to come across
our hydrometers at over 90 percent. Just like you wouldn't what to
come to our scales at the minimum weight.''
</P>
<P>
   The oil-down rule, which was made to create a tighter
elimination schedule, has been just as controversial as the fuel
rule. Teams will be penalized for dropping oil on the track from
the burn-out box to the turn-off road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have my own spotter,'' nine-time Funny Car
champion John Force said. ``What happens if another car crosses
into my lane, drops oil and then drifts back? It's going to be a
tough call.''
</P>
<P>
   Alley said he will help make decisions like that, but the final
ruling will be made by Light.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson believes that it's going to be a nonissue by the middle
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of these rules are major steps,'' Johnson said. ''But I
think after a few races, nobody is going to think about the
oil-down rule because it will probably go away. There might be a
few occasions, but everyone is going to be so aware of it that it's
not going to happen anymore.''

STANFORD BEATS UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two hours before tipoff Thursday night, UCLA
senior Sean Farnham strolled across the Pauley Pavilion floor,
smile and spirit in tow. But when someone asked about Farnham's
locker-room tirade after UCLA's loss at Oregon, his grin
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The true test of whether it did any good or not,'' Farnham
said, ``will be how we play tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   By that standard, Farnham's wall-banging, fist-pounding harangue
was a failure. The Bruins never had a chance against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that's not true. They had a chance for about four
minutes, at which point Stanford powered to a 10-point lead and the
game was over.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins trailed by 16 at halftime and 20 early in the second
half. A brief rally avoided complete embarrassment, but the final
score _ a 78-63 Stanford victory, before 11,692 _ accurately
reflected the Cardinal's dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first half, they had us well-scouted,'' Bruins guard
Earl Watson said. ``They knew every play. They were right there.
They did a great job of preparation. We had no answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Given UCLA's performance against Stanford in recent years _ and
against the top teams in the Pacific-10 this season _ the outcome
was not a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal has defeated UCLA in six of the last seven games,
with 77 points separating the teams. Stanford's 48-point thrashing
in Maples Pavilion three years ago skews the differential but only
slightly: It has two consecutive double-digit victories in Pauley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen points in L.A. is certainly acceptable,'' Cardinal
coach Mike Montgomery said. ``It's a nice win for us here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins also have played poorly against the teams that were
tied with Stanford atop the conference entering the week losing to
Arizona, USC and Oregon by an average of 14 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   Including Thursday, UCLA is 0-4 against the league's best and
has been outscored by 57 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that they play so well, it's us breaking down with
turnovers and not playing sound defense,'' UCLA freshman Jason
Kapono said. ``Throw in that (the opponents) are playing well and
that builds up to 20 points.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's defeat was UCLA's fifth in its last nine games and
dropped the Bruins to 12-7 overall and 3-5 in the conference, good
for a sixth-place tie with Cal, which visits Pauley on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins aren't desperate, but they can see it from Westwood.
They must win six of their last 11 to reach the 18-win plateau that
probably would secure an NCAA Tournament bid. But winning six of 11
won't be easy, not the way UCLA has played lately.
</P>
<P>
   The most realistic scenario is to count three games as victories
(Oregon State, Washington and Washington State at home) and three
as defeats (Syracuse, Arizona and Stanford on the road). That means
the Bruins must win three of five games against Cal (twice), USC
(home), Oregon (home) and Arizona State (road).
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming into the season, you set your goals high,'' Kapono
said. ``At this point, we're just worried about getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins spent most of Thursday's first half in a zone
defense, which forced Stanford to shoot from the perimeter, which
it did, making 6 of 10 3-pointers to build its halftime lead. When
the Bruins extended to cover the shooters, Stanford passed the ball
inside for layups and short jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can get a little lost (in the zone),'' Stanford guard
David Moseley said. ``If you're any kind of shooter, you start
salivating.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's offense was ineffective against Stanford's smothering
defense, which leads the nation in field-goal percentage allowed.
The Bruins shot 35.7 percent and scored 22 points in the first
half. They played better in the second, cutting the 20-point
deficit in half. But the rally lasted just four minutes, then
Stanford, behind freshman Casey Jacobsen, regained control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit some big shots when we needed them,'' Montgomery
said.``
</P>
<P>
   Kapono led UCLA with 21 points. Jacobsen scored 17 in his first
appearance in Pauley since scoring 43 for Glendora High in the
Martin Luther King Dream Classic 55 weeks ago.

ANTI-DRUG PROGRAMMING INCENTIVES TO BE DISCONTINUED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BILL HILLBURG AND VALERIE KUKLENSKI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
  LOS ANGELES _ The chairman of a U.S. Senate Appropriations
subcommittee said Thursday that the program-content-for-advertising
swap between the drug czar's office and TV networks is not what
Congress approved and will be discontinued.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``When we made appropriations to this program we did not
authorize such in-kind contributions,'' said Sen. Ben Nighthorse
Campbell, R-Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a misuse of a billion dollars. The program was
not designed to be a windfall for the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said Congress will continue funding drug czar Barry R.
McCaffrey's advertising campaign for anti-drug efforts, but the
committee voted to change the terms to eliminate the
program-content aspect of the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first response from Congress to an investigative
report published last month in Salon online magazine that detailed
how the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy offered
financial incentives to TV networks aimed at encouraging series
episodes with anti-drug themes.
</P>
<P>
   The incentives were part of the ONDCP's $1 billion, five-year
media campaign for which it negotiated an additional $1 billion
worth of free advertising for those ``this is your brain on drugs''
spots and similar messages.
</P>
<P>
   The White House drug office has given back $21.8 million worth
of the free air time it was owed, in exchange for acceptable
anti-drug series episodes since late 1998. Networks could resell
that time to other advertisers at standard rates _ the ``windfall''
Campbell mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does not violate the letter of the law but it does
violate the spirit of what we were trying to do,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have charged that the arrangement infringes on the
networks' freedom of speech, and that the scripts altered under
drug office guidance were a form of propaganda because viewers were
not advised.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Levitt, the director of the ONDCP media campaign,
criticized what he called ``unfounded allegations of attacks on the
First Amendment and of Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing could be further from the truth,'' Levitt told the
senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing about this campaign is that it's
working,'' he added, citing statistics showing declines in drug use
and increased awareness of its dangers among teens.
</P>
<P>
   Common Sense for Drug Policy, an umbrella organization
representing several drug reform groups claiming 100,000 members,
called Thursday for McCaffrey's resignation based on the
program-content issue as well as U.S. involvement in Colombian
civil turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ONDCP spokesman Pancho Kinney dismissed the group's demand as
``crazy.'' ``Why would anyone resign for following the law?''

USC FALLS TO CAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC's basketball team has survived two players
breaking bones, but when the Trojans break the rim, that's far too
much to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans shot a season-low 15 percent from the 3-point line,
making only 3 of 20 shots behind the arc, and finally showed the
effects of being without leading scorer Sam Clancy and sixth man
Jarvis Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, seldom-used Rashad Jones would not be taking a
potential game -winning shot with 26.5 seconds left. Or true
freshman Nate Hair would not shoot a potential game-winning
3-pointer in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, neither scored, and USC lost to California,
66-62, before 5,587 at the Sports Arena on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans were flat for most of the game and finally looked
like a team that has been ravaged by injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every phase of the game, they outplayed us,'' USC coach Henry
Bibby said. ``They were more physical, quicker, they executed. They
deserved to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The first sign something was amiss occurred right after tipoff
when USC fell behind 7-0 in the opening minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like offensively we were out of sync,'' forward
David Bluthenthal said. ``We didn't run plays we were supposed to.
Defensively, we lost our man at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite these problems, the Trojans still had a chance to win
the game.
</P>
<P>
   USC trailed 63-62 with a minute remaining and had the ball.
That's when Jones, who had not tried a shot the entire game and has
not scored a point in Pac-10 play, drove to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   He was quickly tied up by Cal's Dennis Gates and Nick Vander
Laan for a jump ball and the Bears took possession with 41.6
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Gates was fouled with 24.6 seconds remaining and made one of two
free throws to give Cal a 64-62 lead. The Trojans (13-7, 6-2) still
had a chance to tie the game, but Brandon Granville missed a
3-pointer with 21 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bibby) wanted me to shoot it if I was open,'' Granville said.
``I thought it was going in. It just wormed out.''
</P>
<P>
   USC got the rebound, however, but Granville was then stripped of
the ball. He then tied up Vander Laan for another jump ball. The
Trojans retained possession, but in the closing seconds Hair took a
3-pointer that bounced off the rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stuff you dream about when you are a kid and the most
devastating feeling in the world to miss that shot,'' Hair said.
``I felt like I let everyone in the arena down. I just rushed it.
It was tight. It was a decent look, but I knew it was going to be
short.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact those two players who haven't been in those situations
were taking the final shots showed how shorthanded the Trojans
were, especially after Bluthenthal fouled out with 6:26 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Brian Scalabrine (25 points, nine rebounds), no other
Trojan had even a decent game. Bluthenthal, Trepagnier, Granville
and Hair were a combined 12 of 37 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine did not question who was taking the shots at the end
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a go-to guy on this team,'' he said. ``On this
team, who ever does best takes the shot. Whoever is open takes the
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   That wouldn't be a problem if someone was capable of making a
3-pointer Just last weekend, USC made a Pacific-10 record 20
3-pointers against Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I guess you see what the 3-pointer is like,'' Bibby said.
``You're not going to shoot it well every game.''
</P>
<P>
   USC now has the unenviable prospect of needing to upset No.
2-ranked Stanford or getting swept at home. The Trojans had their
nine-game winning streak at home and it was the first game they
dropped at the Sports Arena this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go on the road and split and then lose the first
game at home,'' Bibby said.
</P>
<P>
   Shantay Legans led Cal with 12 points while Vander Laan had 11.
The Bears have defeated the Trojans five straight times.

A REUNION TO SAVOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reunions are a mixed bag when it comes to music. When the Eagles
returned to the stage, they marked the occasion with great music
and an album titled ``Hell Freezes Over.''
</P>
<P>
   But the iniital efforts of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young on
their CSNY2K tour have been played in the key of B flat. Somewhere
between Woodstock and the new millennium, they lost their harmony.
</P>
<P>
   This relates because one of the finest trios in the history of
sportscasting makes a one-time-only appearance Saturday (10 a.m.)
on CBS for the Connecticut-Michigan State college basketball game.
</P>
<P>
   It's been almost 19 years since Dick Enberg, Billy Packer and Al
McGuire last worked together, calling the 1981 NCAA title game
between North Carolina and Indiana. Monday Night Football may have
launched the three-man booth in 1970, but NBC's threesome was the
first to make it work. Enberg was the play-by-play point man,
Packer was the nuts and bolts analyst, and McGuire was the
emotional eccentric who added levity and personality.
</P>
<P>
   The trio worked together for four seasons (1978-81) before CBS
took the NCAA package away from NBC in 1982. Enberg stayed at NBC,
Packer jumped to CBS, and McGuire has idled himself with part-time
TV work and public speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Enberg's move to CBS last month -- he worked a game with Packer
and will team with McGuire the rest of the season --opened the door
for Saturday's reunion that one media wit has compared to a reunion
of the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   The participants laughed at that notion while also agreeing that
a reunion can only take you so far, and they have no plan to get in
the way of the game they're working.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll let our chance for an encore get in the
way of the game,'' said Enberg this week. ``The game is why we're
there, and I think it will take us into some good places.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that Al and Billy will have a disagreement ten
minutes into the game, because whenever Al says black, Billy says
white. We all expect that. We won't get in the way of the game, but
we won't be soft violin music, either.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't return to the old days,'' said McGuire. ``It was a
happening at the time. We'll just be ourselves, and we were always
three guys who left their egos in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Packer is still laughing at that line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it incredible that we're actually going to be together
again,'' Packer said. ``People can't understand how much has
changed in the last 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   That's especially so considering the circumstances of their last
game on March 30, 1981, which happened to fall on the same day that
President Ronald Reagan was shot. In the hours before the game, a
decision had to be made whether the game would be cancelled, and
the decision to go ahead was debated long after Indiana's 63-50 win
over North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty stunned that the game wasn't postponed for a
day,'' said Enberg. ``The shooting took the enthusiasm out of the
crowd, and our own enthusiasm was a little drained. Other than who
won the game, there's little I remember of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Packer and McGuire, who arrived together at the Philadelphia
Spectrum unaware of the shooting, remember the ensuing chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was (running) around. (NBC Sports exec) Don Ohlmeyer
grabs us and tells us to get our speeches (on Reagan and the
shooting) prepared for when we go on the air,'' said Packer. ``I
got nervous. I'm not capable of giving a speech about what I
thought about the President's situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al looks at me and says `Billy, Billy, Billy, they're never
going to ask us to give a speech. Let's go get a hot dog.' He was
absolute correct.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ohlmeyer and (the NCAA's) Dave Gavitt were walking around the
arena trying to make a decision,'' recalled McGuire. ``I said `Don,
they're playing the (consolation) game. Let's forget about it and
get to work.' That may sound crude, but that's the way I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Packer has one memory that didn't play out for years. The NCAA
and NBC decided to play the game once they were told the president
was ``out of danger.'' That call came about 45 minutes before
tipoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read his memoirs years later,'' said Packer, ``and realized
he was not out of danger when we started the game. That just makes
it more remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Their other memories are light-hearted. Enberg remembers he and
Maguire sitting in an empty restaurant before his first title game
broadcast (1978), going over notes. Apropos of nothing, McGuire
asked Enberg if he had ever read `The Little Prince.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That moment will forever live vividly in my mind,'' Enberg
said. ``We spent 30 minutes talking about that story, then walked
out to do the title game. Al pretends he doesn't know that next to
my father, he's the wisest guy I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Packer relationship with McGuire was similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Easter Sunday in St. Louis, and I went to mass,''
Packer recalled. ``The church was crowded, and I could see a group
of what looked like homeless people in the front of the church. I
went up to take communion, turned around, and there's Al in the
middle of that group. All I could do was laugh as I walked away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went on a long walk and decide to stop for breakfast, and
Al walks into this restaurant and says he works for the St. Louis
sanitation department and is there for an inspection. We sit down
and ate a free breakfast while Al tells them they're not up to
code.''
</P>
<P>
   Enberg, Packer and McGuire were always up to code.
</P>
<P>
   AND NOW THE NEWS: Next year's NFL schedule may have a new look.
December games on ABC's Monday Night Football may not be chosen
until November, giving the network and league a chance to put
meaningful and marquee attractions on the schedule. ABC was stuck
with several who-cares matchups late last season ... The NFL isn't
acting particularly bothered by the announcement of a spring minor
league by the owners of the WWF. Indeed, if the league continues to
finds its World League to costly, it could want a part of the
proposed XFL ... CBS has the Pebble Beach Pro-Am Saturday and
Sunday (noon both days), with all eyes focused on Tiger Woods'
five-match winning streak. Gary McCord doesn't think it's possible
for a golfer to catch Byron Nelson's record of 11 straight. ``I
keep thinking `no one is that good in this day and age,' but he
certainly is making a point.'' ... ESPN has the U.S.-Norway women's
soccer game Sunday at 11 a.m., and ESPN2 airs the Davis Cup first
round match between the U.S. and Zimbabwe same-day delayed Friday
(9 p.m.), Saturday (7 a.m.) and Sunday (11:30 a.m.) ... Jim Huber's
``The Sporting Life,'' an underrated show that took 1999 off,
returns Sunday on CNN and CNN/SI (7 a.m., repeats on CNN/SI at 9:30
a.m., 4:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m.) ... Fox Sports Net 2 has the Bishop
Montgomery-Serra boy's prep basketball game tonight live at 7 p.m.
The upcoming Mater Dei-La Salle and Dominguez-Oak Hill games will
air delayed Tuesday at 7 and 8:30 p.m.

 &HT;     McCAIN DISMISSES ATTACKS ON HIS VOTING RECORD ON MILITARY &HT;     (Eds.: Tod Harris is cq)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By R.G. RATCLIFFE and GREG McDONALD   
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUMTER, S.C. - George W. Bush prompted an attack Thursday from
military heroes, activists and a former Joint Chiefs of Staff
chairman on rival John McCain's voting record on veterans and
POW/MIA issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush refused to criticize McCain, but stood alongside the
veterans' activist who made the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came home. He forgot us,'' J. Thomas Burch Jr., chairman of
the National Vietnam &AMP; Gulf War Veterans Coalition said of McCain,
who spent nearly six years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam
before his elections to the U.S. House and Senate from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   McCain dismissed the attack as ``foolishness'' brought on by
Bush's 19-point loss Tuesday in New Hampshire and a new poll
showing McCain with a 5-point lead over Bush in South Carolina. A
Time-CNN poll conducted Jan. 26-27 showed Bush leading McCain in
South Carolina by 52 percent to 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina, with 400,000 residents either on active military
duty or retired from the armed services, is another state crucial
to McCain's underdog presidential effort. Its Republican primary is
Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's maybe a little bit of foolishness going on here,''
McCain said in Charleston, S.C., with Fort Sumter and a
decommissioned aircraft carrier as his backdrop. Citing his
endorsement by the Veterans of Foreign Wars and other major
veterans organizations, McCain said, ``Of all the people they could
attack on veteran's issues, they're attacking me?''
</P>
<P>
   McCain officials also challenged the Bush campaign to a debate
on military and veterans issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be happy to debate the governor any time, any place and
stick our record against his ... We hope to God this campaign
centers on which candidate is more committed to defense issue and
veterans affairs,'' said McCain spokesman Tod Harris.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's personal history as a naval aviator who was shot down
and tortured in North Vietnam has been one of the most compelling
attributes of his candidacy. The Texas governor served in the Texas
Air National Guard in Houston during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Burch said McCain has opposed legislation related to Agent
Orange, Gulf War-related health care and the plight of other
Vietnam-era prisoners of war and those missing in action.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain camp challenged those assertions about his support
for veterans health legislation.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, records show, was a co-sponsor in 1991 of the Agent
Orange Act that became law and testified in Congress in 1994 urging
swift action on legislation to provide compensation to Gulf War
veterans suffering from mysterious illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Burch said McCain, a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, opposed the Bring Them Back Alive Bill of 1995 to grant
immigrant status to any Asian who brought an MIA serviceman out of
Asia alive. He said McCain also opposed the Missing Persons
Personnel Act of 1997 to make it easier for family members to get
their missing relatives declared dead.
</P>
<P>
   McCain aides said those bills were attached to unrelated
measures that McCain opposed. The Senate never took up those bills
on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Burch said McCain also supported normalizing relations with
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Burch said relations should not be normalized until there is a
full accounting of all the men still missing from the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did support normalizing relations with Vietnam, a
diplomatic process begun by President Bush. Other Vietnam veterans
in the Senate also backed that effort.
</P>
<P>
   On that issue, Bush said, ``I have no problem with normalization
so long as I was confident there was a full accounting.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush in his speech to about 400 people said he wants to improve
military pay and redesign its mission. He said he also wants to
overhaul the Department of Veterans Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a commander in chief who respects the men and women in
uniform,'' Bush said. ``That is the kind of commander in chief I
will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Bush on stage were three Medal of Honor winners from
South Carolina plus Adm. Thomas Moorer, chairman of the joint
chiefs of staff during the Nixon administration.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on McCain came as both men tried to pick up support
from the state's large military population.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning along the South Carolina coast, home to the Paris
Island Marine Base and hundreds of retirement communities, McCain
stressed not only his military background, but his 13 years in the
Senate as a ``fighter'' for veterans on issues, ranging from health
care to retirement pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am fully prepared to take over right now - this moment - as
commander in chief,'' McCain said to cheers as he addressed
retirees at several rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Bush tried to distance himself from any personal responsibility
for the veteran group attacks on McCain's record on veterans
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I stand by is the fact they've looked at both of us and
they've chosen me to be the nominee,'' Bush told a news conference.
``John McCain served our country well. He was a warrior on behalf
of America ... Let them speak. I appreciate their support.''
</P>
<P>
   Retired Marine Col. Dave Townsend, who now lives in Beaufort,
S.C., said he knows McCain ``has got what it takes, despite what
Bush or anyone else may say about him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need someone who understands what duty and country and
morality means ... If we've got somebody up there who has courage
of convictions it will begin to rub off,'' Said Townsend. ``I don't
have anything against the other candidates. I just think he's it.''

&HT;     WHITE HOUSE SAYS ANTI-DRUG TV CAMPAIGN WILL CONTINUE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An aide to White House drug czar Barry McCaffrey
denied Thursday that administration officials have pressured TV
networks to include anti-drug messages in TV programs but vowed to
continue offering financial incentives for the networks to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drug use is down in this country, and part of that success has
been the changing attitude of the entertainment industry toward
drugs,'' Alan Levitt, director of the National Youth Anti-Drug
Media Campaign, told a Senate panel investigating the
administration's controversial practice.
</P>
<P>
   However, Levitt told the panel that the White House anti-drug
office would no longer provide ``guidance'' to television
scriptwriters while program scripts were still being written.
</P>
<P>
   The government's controversial practice of influencing TV
programming stems from a government-financed advertising campaign
designed to discourage drug use.
</P>
<P>
   The $120 million campaign, which began in 1997, pays for
anti-drug commercials in prime time on six broadcast networks _
ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, WB and ESPN. For every commercial purchased by
the government, the networks agree to donate a
substance-abuse-related public service ad (PSA) in prime time. But
the networks can avoid giving away that second ad _ and instead
profit by selling the air time _ if their regular programming
includes scenes with negative portrayals of substance abuse, as
measured by White House previewers. Eager to regain those PSA slots
so they can sell them to regular commercial advertising, the
networks began submitting scripts and tapes to the White House
anti-drug office for approval before they were broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   According to the White House, scripts or tapes of 130 series
episodes were submitted for review. White House officials then
decided that 109 episodes had anti-drug messages that qualified for
credits under the program.
</P>
<P>
   The White House preview covered such popular and profitable hits
as ``ER,'' ``Beverly Hills 90210,'' and the ``Drew Carey Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the networks were able sell the advertising
time that would have been used for PSAs for an estimated $22
million, Levitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the government's incentive program, Levitt insisted that
the White House never attempted to regulate content or to tell the
show's writers what they had to put in the programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the programs felt any pressure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said that to avoid any ``suggestion of federal
interference in the creative process,'' the White House anti-drug
office will change its policy and will review programs only after
they have aired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't provide guidance on whether a script will qualify for
credits while the writers are still working it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt also urged members of Congress _ some of whom have called
for an end to the credit program _ to keep the campaign alive. He
said the behavior of television characters has more influence over
young people than paid advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask any anti-drug lobby group what they'd rather have, ads or
programming, and 10 out of 10 will pick programming,'' he said.
details of the program became public last week, McCaffrey insisted
that his office had done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey has defended the script-preview program, saying,
``What we're doing is in accordance with the law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am hyper-sensitive to First Amendment rights issues, and I
am not going to get involved in influencing program content,''
McCaffrey said last week.Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo.,
chairman of the Senate panel, said the issue was not whether the
campaign has been effective, but whether the White House was
influencing the content of television shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The White House anti-drug office) has set a dangerous
precedent,'' Campbell said. ``You're on thin ice dealing with a
program's content, whether it's intentional or not.''Sen. Byron
Dorgan, D-N.D., agreed, saying that the campaign raises ``serious
questions'' about the government's role in television programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be disappointed if TV gave a better message, but I
get nervous when I learn that a government agency is involved,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said Congress will continue investigating the extent of
White House influence over television programming and will consider
ways to ensure it does not continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be giving you some very clear and concise
direction to make sure there is no government role in the writing
of shows, and I warn you, that direction may come in the form of
reduced funding,'' he said.

 &HT;    GOLDEN DREAM OF A DEBT-FREE AMERICA NEARLY WITHIN REACH
 &HT;    920&AMP;add. With FEDBUD-DATA and FEDBUD-NUMBERS. For release
Sunday, Feb. 6.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton submits his 2001 budget
proposal to Congress on Monday, the last such exercise of his
career, he'll issue a challenge that seemed a pipe dream just a few
years ago: pay off the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   By 2013, Clinton claims, the country could be nearly debt-free
for the first time in 165 years.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, government borrowing would stop competing
with private enterprise for investment dollars, and American
taxpayers would no longer be strapped with annual interest payments
topping $220 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paying down the debt is an investment that we're making. It's
an investment in the future,'' said Alan Auerbach, professor of
economics and law at the University of California in Berkeley.
``It's a very wise and productive use of the budget surpluses,
certainly as compared to saying 'We have this money, let's find
other things to do with it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan, though, is as uncertain as it is ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   While decades of federal budget deficits have begun to
grudgingly give way to modest surpluses, no one can say whether the
the booming economy will continue to pour growing tax revenues into
government coffers. Even if it does, there's no guarantee that
federal spending will be held in close check.
</P>
<P>
   If these things don't happen, the surpluses needed to pay off
the roughly $3.3 trillion the government owes to banks and private
investors at home and abroad may never materialize.
</P>
<P>
   ``The range of possibilities is really quite substantial,''
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan testified before the
Senate Banking Committee two weeks ago, when asked how confident
planners could be in the surplus projections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crucial issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like others who closely study government finance, though,
Greenspan said paying off the debt is a noble goal that could
create manifest benefits for the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a great weight off the back of future
generations,'' said federal debt expert Robert Bixby, policy
director for the Concord Coalition, a Washington research group.
</P>
<P>
   Debt reduction could also help to keep the economy growing, said
the Treasury Department's Lee Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have the impact of exerting downward pressure on
interest rates,'' said Sachs, assistant secretary for financial
markets. ``That will be reflected in interest rates on things like
home mortgages, consumer loans, business loans, corporate bonds. It
will flow through the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Clinton estimates, a family that owes a bank $100,000
on a home mortgage is probably paying about $2,000 a year less in
interest than it would have if his administration had not reversed
the growth of deficits.
</P>
<P>
   The virtues of debt reduction have been touted for decades,
though mostly in vain.
</P>
<P>
   That's because only over the past two years have the White
House, which proposes the budget, and the Congress, which alone has
the power to levy taxes and spend those revenues, managed to bring
federal outlays in line with tax collections.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's surplus was a statistically negligible $1 billion _
not counting the massive Social Security program and the Postal
Service, which get special budgetary treatment and together ran a
surplus of nearly $124 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For the current fiscal year, which began last October, the
government is on track to run a surplus of about $23 billion _
again, not including Social Security and the Postal Service _
according to projections last month by the Congressional Budget
Office (CBO). That would be the largest federal budget surplus
ever, measured in dollars, and the largest in 49 years as a
percentage of the country's economic output.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton and the Republican-controlled Congress get some
credit, essentially for fighting each other to a draw that has
prevented large-scale spending hikes or tax cuts, neither gets any
medals from economists.
</P>
<P>
   Far more than any policy decisions made in Washington, they
point out, it's the windfall tax revenues generated by the
country's unprecedented economic expansion _ nine years long next
month _ that have turned decades of federal budget deficits into
surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason why the surplus accumulated,'' said Harvard
University economist Alberto Alesino, ``is because the economy is
doing so well that, even at constant tax rates, tax revenues have
gone up.''
</P>
<P>
   With more Americans working than ever before, baby boomers
sailing through their most productive years, overseas markets for
U.S. goods and services expanding, and businesses investing
hundreds of billions of dollars in new technology and
efficiency-enhancing equipment, the federal government will take in
a record $1.945 trillion in taxes this year.
</P>
<P>
   If the economy grows at a rate between 2.7 percent and 3 percent
a year over the next decade, surpluses are projected to pile up
somewhere between $800 billion and $1.9 trillion, the CBO projects,
depending on the kinds of tax and spending decisions made by the
White House and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and his Republican foes, for example, are pressing
for election-year tax cuts. Clinton's budget will propose $350
billion worth of cuts over 10 years, aimed at helping low- and
middle-income families. Republicans have proposed other plans that
are less targeted and would trim revenues more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of the variant,'' CBO Director Dan Crippen
testified last month before the Senate Budget Committee, ``the
budgetary picture is a bright one.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Since the country's founding, the U.S. government, like most
large enterprises, has had to manage debt.
</P>
<P>
   In 1835, President Andrew Jackson helped tamp down the debt to a
record low of $33,733.05 _ about what the federal government now
spends every six-tenths of a second _ but he never completely wiped
it out.
</P>
<P>
   In the last half of this century, however, deficit spending
became a bad habit for Washington. Last year was the first since
1969 that the government was in the black.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a federal debt totalling about $5.7
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Of that, $2.4 trillion is money the government essentially owes
to itself. This is money held in trust funds by dozens of federal
programs. These range from Social Security, which currently holds a
staggering $936.4 billion in its trust fund, to the tiny $1 million
held in trust by the Office of Naval Records and History Fund.
</P>
<P>
   By law, these federal trust funds must be invested in U.S.
government debt, issued as Treasury bonds, notes and bills. Each is
essentially a form of promissory note, issued by the government
when it needs to borrow money, and secured by the full faith and
credit of the U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Treasury is simply paying interest on this debt to
other federal agencies, such payments are, in an accounting sense,
transfers within the government, not an outflow of cash.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining $3.3 trillion of federal debt, however, is held by
private banks and investors. Servicing this so-called publicly held
debt cost U.S. taxpayers $230 billion last year, about 12 cents out
of every federal dollar spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interest payments on the national debt amount to the third
largest item in the budget,'' said Sachs. ``If we didn't have debt,
and didn't have to pay interest on that debt, that's money that is
otherwise available.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed, for instance, that the interest savings
from debt reduction be somehow shoveled into the Social Security
trust fund. That, he said, could generate enough cash to extend the
solvency of the program at least 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is constantly paying down debt. It did so
even through the darkest of the deficit years such as 1992, when
the government spent as much as $290 billion more than it took in
through taxes.
</P>
<P>
   During years of large deficits, however, the government had to
borrow more money than it paid back to lenders, much like a
homeowner who manages to make the monthly mortgage payments, yet
continues to pile up credit card charges. That's what caused the
national debt to swell.
</P>
<P>
   The government continues to borrow money, by issuing Treasury
bills, notes and bonds. It has begun reducing both the number of
auctions for the sale of these securities, and the volume of IOUs
that it issues at each.
</P>
<P>
   As its borrowing requirements decline, the Treasury has begun
paying off more debt than it is assuming, again, much as a
homeowner might begin nibbling away at household credit card debt,
even while paying down the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   During the current quarter, for example, the Treasury Department
will pay off $17 billion more than it will borrow. During April,
May and June, the Treasury Department estimates that it will pay
down a record $152 billion more than it will borrow. That's the
quarter when revenues tend to come in fastest, owing to the tax
collection calendar.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is projected to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is now a consensus among private sector and government
forecasters that these paydowns will grow in the future,'' Treasury
Under Secretary for Domestic Finance, Gary Gensler, told reporters
last week in announcing the Treasury Department's plan for trimming
its borrowing.

 &HT;    Two dogs, two days of sleet and a man without any sense
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ The two dogs that own my family made it plenty
clear Thursday morning that they absolutely were not going to stand
for getting out in that white stuff that was falling from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   They ran out of the house as usual then stopped abruptly and
looked upward. Just as quickly, they beat it back into the house.
These are Southern dogs and they don't know snow or, as was the
case Thursday, sleet.
</P>
<P>
   Inside they went. Of course, they spent the entire time at the
window longing to be outside. I did not say they were particularly
intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the, uh, internal forces of Mother Nature had won out over
the weather by the time we returned that afternoon and both dogs
were ready to flee outside to find relief.
</P>
<P>
   The border collie's fear of the sleet had turned into puppy
love. He danced, he pranced. He caught ice balls on his tongue. The
dachshund was another matter altogether, which we attributed to the
fact that he couldn't walk outside without his entire underbelly
dragging bottom.
</P>
<P>
   In the same situation, I myself would be reluctant. The
dachshund went inside without responding to the call of nature. The
only problem is that, like a bill collector, nature just won't quit
calling.
</P>
<P>
   So, about 9 p.m. Thursday night, payment in full _ and I do mean
in full _ was deposited right before our eyes on the hardwood
floor.
</P>
<P>
   My wife screamed. My children swooned. I said only: ``Somebody
else is gonna clean that up.''
</P>
<P>
   To make sure of that, I picked up the weenie-dog and hustled him
outside, determined that he would make yellow snow before he
re-entered the house.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it was unclear whether I or the dog was getting
punished most since, in my anger, I had gone outside without a coat
and wearing sandals.
</P>
<P>
   I stood there shivering, feet getting wet while the dog
delicately picked his way through the ice. He disappeared around
the corner and I, having had my National Geographic lesson of the
month (year, lifetime?) on doggie digestion, waited for him to
return.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't return.
</P>
<P>
   I called out his name, idly wondering if he had frozen into a
weenie-dog Popsicle and couldn't come back. I called his name again
and again.
</P>
<P>
   He did not return.
</P>
<P>
   So I trudged, coatless, through the ice. Still I wasn't worried.
I was actually considering the possibilities of using sleet to make
a Margarita. I could have used one.
</P>
<P>
   Around the corner of the house, no dog. Only tiny dog paw prints
leading into the vast white distance. I yelled. I pleaded. I got my
feet wetter and colder.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, who minutes earlier would have barbecued the mutt, now
sought his immediate return. I rallied the troops and, within just
a few minutes, we looked like a Swiss patrol looking for a lost
skier.
</P>
<P>
   The only living creature more stupid than the dog was me. In all
of this I never changed into real shoes. Does anyone know what
frostbite looks like?
</P>
<P>
   After an hour of searching without luck, the dog trotted up from
nowhere as if he had never left. Back inside he was wrapped in a
blanket and welcomed back immediately into the bosom of his family.
I couldn't even get sympathy for my cold, wet feet.
</P>
<P>
   I think it is time to get a cat.

   To make sure of that, I picked up the weenie-dog and hustled him
outside, determined that he would make yellow snow before he
re-entered the house.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it was unclear whether I or the dog was getting
punished most since, in my anger, I had gone outside without a coat
and wearing sandals.
</P>
<P>
   I stood there shivering, feet getting wet while the dog
delicately picked his way through the ice. He disappeared around
the corner and I, having had my National Geographic lesson of the
month (year, lifetime?) on doggie digestion, waited for him to
return.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't return.
</P>
<P>
   I called out his name, idly wondering if he had frozen into a
weenie-dog Popsicle and couldn't come back. I called his name again
and again.
</P>
<P>
   He did not return.
</P>
<P>
   So I trudged, coatless, through the ice. Still I wasn't worried.
I was actually considering the possibilities of using sleet to make
a Margarita. I could have used one.
</P>
<P>
   Around the corner of the house, no dog. Only tiny dog paw prints
leading into the vast white distance. I yelled. I pleaded. I got my
feet wetter and colder.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, who minutes earlier would have barbecued the mutt, now
sought his immediate return. I rallied the troops and, within just
a few minutes, we looked like a Swiss patrol looking for a lost
skier.
</P>
<P>
   The only living creature more stupid than the dog was me. In all
of this I never changed into real shoes. Does anyone know what
frostbite looks like?
</P>
<P>
   After an hour of searching without luck, the dog trotted up from
nowhere as if he had never left. Back inside he was wrapped in a
blanket and welcomed back immediately into the bosom of his family.
I couldn't even get sympathy for my cold, wet feet.
</P>
<P>
   I think it is time to get a cat.

 &HT;    High-schoolers' expensive wheels raise issue of `bratlash'
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ I have just completed an eye-opening
educational experience. Every morning for a week I drove my
granddaughter to school.
</P>
<P>
   This is a pleasant chore I've been doing from time to time since
she was in kindergarten. My first run to the high school, where she
is in her first year, was an eye-popper.
</P>
<P>
   Approaching the southern city limits of Fayetteville, we caught
up to a long line of traffic almost at a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Must be a wreck,'' I said. ``Traffic shouldn't be backed up
like this even at 8 o'clock in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' she replied. ``It's always like this.''
</P>
<P>
   We continued to creep along. I began to notice an unusual number
of pickup trucks, all of them late models, shiny, and jammed with
accessories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder where all the fancy trucks are going,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to school,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who do they belong to?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the kids,'' she answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do they drive trucks?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they're cool. I want one when I get my driver's
license next year.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought she was being funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are a pretty little girl, and you want to drive a truck to
school?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure I want a truck,'' she said. ``They're soooo cool!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean girls like pickup trucks?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they do,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a switch,'' I said. ``When your grandmother was your
age she wouldn't have been caught dead in a pickup truck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a Ford truck,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is that?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to run better, and they're prettier.'' Our
granddaughter is a serious student of trucks.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't mention that the fancy new pickups cost about twice as
much as our first house.
</P>
<P>
   ``You better start getting into the left lane so we can turn off
to the school,'' she advised. ``Turn your blinker on, and cut in
front of that blue Volvo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You remind me of your grandmother,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep straight and turn where that red truck is turning,'' she
instructed.
</P>
<P>
   When we got to the intersection where the red truck had turned,
a gentleman in civilian clothes was directing traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is that?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our assistant principal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' I replied. ``Now teachers have to be traffic cops,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After you let me out, you can follow the line of cars around
the parking lot and back out to the highway,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The line of cars reminded me of Athens in November, when Georgia
plays Tech, Auburn or Tennessee at home.
</P>
<P>
   The parking lot was full of shiny pickup trucks, SUVs and
late-model cars of every description. Spotted around were
2-year-old BMWs and Volvos handed down from yuppie parents.
</P>
<P>
   Kids in designer outfits were hunting for parking places. An
endless caravan of parents (and grandparents) deposited those too
young to drive. Gasoline and diesel fumes filled the morning air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder why we have schoolbuses?'' I mumbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks for the ride,'' my granddaughter said as she unloaded
books and cheerleader paraphernalia. ``Mama will pick me up this
afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Heading back to the highway, I was startled to see an apparition
from another era. A skinny young man, books strapped in his
backpack, coat flapping in the wind, was riding a bicycle to
school! I wanted to get out and hug him.
</P>
<P>
   I knew from reading the newspaper that Fayette County is one of
the more affluent metro areas. Until I saw all those late-model
vehicles converging on the high school, I had no idea how affluent,
or how many parents are strapping themselves financially to buy
$20,000 and $25,000 vehicles (not to mention insurance) for their
kids to drive, or be driven, to school in style.
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly a far piece from the unheated, un-air-conditioned
Blue Bird buses we got out and pushed through the mud when unpaved
roads became nearly impassable in rainy spells.
</P>
<P>
   The real question is where those sporty pickups and chauffeured
cars are taking our children on the road of life. The Wall Street
Journal recently ran a story about the problem of trying to raise
unspoiled kids in a society that gives them everything money can
buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can parents in this affluent era possibly pass on the
middle-class values they grew up with?'' is the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heady economics of the 1990s has turned family-raising on
its head,'' the Wall Street Journal story stated. ``A backlash _
call it bratlash _ is building across the country. Parents are
worried about raising screwed-up kids.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, our granddaughter shows no signs of bratlash. She
doesn't covet expensive things other than pickup trucks, and her
grandmother promises to disabuse her of that.
</P>
<P>
   However, I have a suspicion that the best thing the Legislature
could do for affluent parents, and not-so-affluent parents trying
to keep up with the Joneses, would be to pass a law requiring
schoolchildren to ride schoolbuses.

 &HT;    No, baby, baby _ there's no way I'm letting my daughter watch
Britney
 &HT;    By Ricardo Gandara
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Rachel and her 8-year-old daughter, Samantha,
were coming out of a record store at local mall. Samantha _ toting
a plastic bag _ was smiling; Rachel was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't use my last name. I'm already horrified as it is,''
Rachel explains. ``I let her buy something, and I'm just not
sure.'' Samantha was the proud owner of ``Baby One More Time,'' the
debut album by Britney Spears.
</P>
<P>
   Across America, little girls who are still losing teeth are
ditching Disney toons in favor of hot pop divas like the sultry
Spears and Christina Aguilera and youthful beefcakes like Ricky
Martin, the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra, my 7-year-old baby, has discovered teen idols, too.
And Lord knows she didn't learn about them from me (I'm still
playing my old Earth Wind &AMP; Fire albums). She got it from her
peers, from television, from society. It was inevitable, says Peter
Christenson, professor of communications at Lewis and Clark College
and author of ``It's Not Only Rock &AMP; Roll: Pop Music in the Lives
of Adolescents'' (Hampton Press, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   In the early '80s, girls in the third grade switched from the
music their parents wanted them to hear to pop music, Christenson
says. ``Now, the trend is getting earlier and earlier.
Physiologically, kids are reaching puberty younger. There is a
relentless marketing of pop music to kids, and 6- and 7-year-olds
are looking up to the fourth-graders for fashion and trends. It's
always been this way, but it's accelerated these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. But ex-Mousketeer Britney Spears has accelerated
too much for my taste. Catch a glimpse of her in the latest issue
of People and you'll know why Rolling Stone calls her a ``growling
jailbait dynamo.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Spice Girls phenomenon, parents are forced to accept
Britney's whole package _ the well-toned abs, the suspiciously
sudden cleavage, the come-hither glance _ and not just her singing.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, Alexandra asked me to tape Britney's
performance on ``Good Morning America.'' Obliging daddy that I am,
I dutifully set the timer. Overprotective daddy that I am, I
screened the tape myself before letting her see it. What I saw was
an 18-year-old girl wiggling her thing for the coffee-and-waffles
crowd. She also seemed to be having a real tough time keeping her
tube top on.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, honey, daddy couldn't get the VCR to work.
</P>
<P>
   Christenson and Amazon.com children's music editor Andrew
Bartlett recommend that parents stay in the game when their
children are exploring music. ``Bring the music home to your kids
before they bring it to you,'' says Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   That and blow up the TV.

 &HT;    Web site directs users to wood project plans
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Listen up, all you woodworkers who are constantly in
search of project plans.
</P>
<P>
   A reader has kindly alerted me to a site on the World Wide Web
for an outfit that has updated and modernized the old index to
woodworking publications, with an emphasis on plans.
</P>
<P>
   It can be had in two forms. The Guide is the print version,
covering 26 woodworking periodicals. The 450-page book sells for
$55 if you mail-order it, but the ``Internet price'' is $39.
</P>
<P>
   For woodworkers with computers, the better choice would be
Woodplan 2000, the electronic version of The Guide, which allows
you to search for articles and plans in all the standard ways, and
to restrict your searches to those magazines you own.
</P>
<P>
   Woodplan 2000 sells for $45, or $35 on the Internet. The editors
promise to update both editions every winter.
</P>
<P>
   Bear in mind that neither of these items actually contain any
plans or articles; they merely point you to the specific editions
of magazines which have what you're looking for.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have an extensive collection of magazines, you can
often buy back issues from the publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Woodplan can be had on a free 30-day trial basis.
</P>
<P>
   The URL for the Web site is www.woodplanindexing.com. If you're
not hooked into the cyberworld, you can telephone (610) 446-7231.
</P>
<P>
   I have also received from a reader an eletronic copy of an
exchange of e-mails with Rockler Woodworking about the drill press
table discussed here some weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that my reader ordered the table because I said it was
nice, and not because he thought he needed it. He seems to agree,
now that he has it, that it's nice, but he doesn't know what to do
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Well, he's not the first woodworker in this position. I've never
bought a tool without a purpose for it, but I've bought some I
couldn't figure out how to use.
</P>
<P>
   As I mentioned in the original column, the chief use for the
table will be to automate the repetitive drilling of holes. To
elaborate:
</P>
<P>
   If you've got 25 pieces of wood and each of them needs to have a
3/8-inch hole drilled two inches from one end, centered on the
width, you set up the table for it.
</P>
<P>
   Take one of the workpieces and find the center exactly two
inches from the proper end of the board. Put a 3/8-inch bit in the
press, put the workpiece against the fence, and adjust the fence so
that the point of the bit falls exactly on the center of the
workpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the workpiece in place, bring one of the stops up to the
end of the board and clamp it in place.
</P>
<P>
   Now you are set up to drill a hole in exactly the same place on
every board.

 &HT;    Pianist breaks bounds of `free jazz'
 &HT;    By Leigh-Ann Jackson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Early retirement is a luxury usually enjoyed by
the professional linebackers and power forwards of the world. The
average jazz musician would likely entertain the thought with a
smile and a far-off gaze before burrowing back into his or her
craft. For 39-year-old avant-garde jazz pianist Matthew Shipp, a
halt from the breakneck pace of his career was a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most significant jazz pianists to emerge in the past
decade, Shipp turned heads last May when he announced his
resignation from the role of band leader and recording artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the studio a lot, I have a whole body of work out
there. I don't want to become a machine that churns out albums,''
Shipp said by phone from his home in New York. ``I kind of want to
step back from the process and think for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the heel-cooling session began, Thirsty Ear Records
offered Shipp the opportunity to produce the label's new line of
jazz recordings, dubbed ``The Blue Series.'' Realizing he'd be
foolish to refuse, he geared up to don the production hat. The
series' first release, credited to the Matthew Shipp Quartet, is
``Pastorale Composure,'' due for release in April.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in Delaware, Shipp embarked on his jazz journey
at age 12. He has pursued the study of jazz piano history in both
the halls of academia _ the University of Delaware and the New
England Conservatory _ and in the field with jazz veterans like
Dennis Sandole (John Coltrane's mentor) and a teacher he calls only
``Boysie,'' whose past students include '50s trumpet great Clifford
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   At 23, Shipp migrated to New York City with the intent of
meeting and establishing an alliance with William Parker, a noted
Lower East Side bassist whose albums had intrigued him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually moved to New York to play with him,'' Shipp
recalls. Within a week of his move, he accidentally met Parker on
the street, offered him a copy of his tape and the two men have
performed as an itinerate duo ever since. ``It's kind of like a
storybook story, but it's actually true. We have a very close bond
and we've worked together in a lot of sets. We've grown to be known
as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes are known to swarm from Shipp's piano like a hail of flame
at one moment and smolder like embers the next. Often defying
description, the composite parts of his ``opus,'' as he calls it,
are as complex as they are dense. Traditional jazz movements from
the past _ those crafted by Duke Ellington, Bud Powell and Fats
Waller _ have made their mark on his music but he bucks tradition
at every turn with his unconventional abstraction.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of his off-the-cuff stylings _ and with a frequency
that disturbs him _ Shipp's music is often referred to as free
jazz, the style of improvising that skirts the confines of
conventional modes of timekeeping and harmonizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free jazz doesn't really exist, that's my take on it,'' Shipp
said. ``I don't play free jazz. I play jazz-oriented music that has
a base in ... you know how John Coltrane tried to create a cosmic
music? I too am obsessed with the idea of creating a cosmic music.
It's a kind of a spiritually based music with deep jazz overtones.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody could freely improvise and play something
different and new every night, they'd be the greatest genius that
ever lived. I think in music, what you have to do is, instead of
generalizing it, you have to get to the specifics of what makes a
person tick and why their music has appeal. As an improvisor, I've
spent my whole life refining a vocabulary and an approach and the
term `free jazz' is too vague. It doesn't get to the root of what
somebody's doing musically... It doesn't really get to the essence
of what anybody is doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I bring to the table is I'm in the present and I sound of
the present; I'm an original voice. There's some people who will
listen to what we say and they'll say, `What's the difference
between what you do and what was done in the '60s?' My reaction to
that is to say, 'Well, find me an album that was put out in the
'60s that sounds like me.' And they couldn't, because it doesn't
exist.''

 &HT;    Web site directs users to wood project plans
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Listen up, all you woodworkers who are constantly in
search of project plans.
</P>
<P>
   A reader has kindly alerted me to a site on the World Wide Web
for an outfit that has updated and modernized the old index to
woodworking publications, with an emphasis on plans.
</P>
<P>
   It can be had in two forms. The Guide is the print version,
covering 26 woodworking periodicals. The 450-page book sells for
$55 if you mail-order it, but the ``Internet price'' is $39.
</P>
<P>
   For woodworkers with computers, the better choice would be
Woodplan 2000, the electronic version of The Guide, which allows
you to search for articles and plans in all the standard ways, and
to restrict your searches to those magazines you own.
</P>
<P>
   Woodplan 2000 sells for $45, or $35 on the Internet. The editors
promise to update both editions every winter.
</P>
<P>
   Bear in mind that neither of these items actually contain any
plans or articles; they merely point you to the specific editions
of magazines which have what you're looking for.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have an extensive collection of magazines, you can
often buy back issues from the publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Woodplan can be had on a free 30-day trial basis.
</P>
<P>
   The URL for the Web site is www.woodplanindexing.com. If you're
not hooked into the cyberworld, you can telephone (610) 446-7231.
</P>
<P>
   I have also received from a reader an eletronic copy of an
exchange of e-mails with Rockler Woodworking about the drill press
table discussed here some weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that my reader ordered the table because I said it was
nice, and not because he thought he needed it. He seems to agree,
now that he has it, that it's nice, but he doesn't know what to do
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Well, he's not the first woodworker in this position. I've never
bought a tool without a purpose for it, but I've bought some I
couldn't figure out how to use.
</P>
<P>
   As I mentioned in the original column, the chief use for the
table will be to automate the repetitive drilling of holes. To
elaborate:
</P>
<P>
   If you've got 25 pieces of wood and each of them needs to have a
3/8-inch hole drilled two inches from one end, centered on the
width, you set up the table for it.
</P>
<P>
   Take one of the workpieces and find the center exactly two
inches from the proper end of the board. Put a 3/8-inch bit in the
press, put the workpiece against the fence, and adjust the fence so
that the point of the bit falls exactly on the center of the
workpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the workpiece in place, bring one of the stops up to the
end of the board and clamp it in place.
</P>
<P>
   Now you are set up to drill a hole in exactly the same place on
every board.

APPLE STORMS HOLLYWOOD WITH NEW MOVIE SOFTWARE

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Apple's new iMovie software on the newer,
beefier iMacs allows users to load digital video clips into the
computer, then edit them in an easy cut-and-paste environment. The
end result is a relatively slick home movie.
</P>
<P>
   Video-editing software titles have long been available to PC
users. But Mac users haven't had any standouts in this department _
until now.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Jobs, the chief executive of Apple Computer Inc., hyped
the iMovie software at the recent Macworld Expo. During his keynote
speech, Jobs showed off polished home videos made by Apple
executives.
</P>
<P>
   IMovie, in short, is probably one of the most compelling pieces
of software available for the iMac. It's also probably the most fun
and one of the easiest multimedia titles.
</P>
<P>
   But the fun costs money. To begin using iMovie, or any of the
newer digital video-editing titles, you have to have your movies in
digital form. The newer digital video cameras (DV for short) exist,
and this is where you'll have to shell out some bucks. These new
cameras cost at least $1,200.
</P>
<P>
   You can use standard VHS cameras and tapes, but that will
require a converter to get the clips loaded into the computer _ a
$250 investment. Some camera stores also will convert tapes into
the digital format.
</P>
<P>
   The next hurdle will be to get these digital video clips into
the iMac. If you have a digital camera, you can simply connect the
digital camera and the computer by their FireWire ports.
</P>
<P>
   IMovie opens a window on the iMac screen that echoes the
playback screen on the camera. You can fast forward and rewind,
selecting and recording clips into the computer. The process is
fast and seamless.
</P>
<P>
   Once the clips are selected, they appear on the screen as small
blocks with the opening shot on each block for easy identification.
Drag these blocks to a time line at the bottom of the screen,
cropping what you don't want. The order of the scene blocks can be
changed by simply dragging them around the time line.
</P>
<P>
   Once you get a good sequence, you can then link the scenes
together with transitions, which you drag over from a list of
various effects, like a fade-in, fade-out or wipe across the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Next up, you add opening and closing credits, picking from a
selection of styles, fonts and colors. Again, these are blocks you
drag and drop at the beginning and end of your movie.
</P>
<P>
   Putting a soundtrack in is a breeze. Load a CD into the
computer, select a drag you want. It appears in iMovie as another
time line you can crop, add fade-ins and fade-outs to, and control
the volume so it doesn't drown out the action.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have a movie you're happy with, you can convert it into
a Quicktime movie and send it to a pal through e-mail. You can also
load it onto a VHS tape, but doing this took some gymnastics. The
completed iMovie had to be loaded back into the digital camera, and
the camera hooked to the VCR for recording onto a VHS tape.
</P>
<P>
   Because this was a digital process, picture quality was great
throughout the editing, and there was just a small bit of smudging
when the computer-based movie was moved back onto tape.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most surprising thing of all, the iMac DV I was
using never crashed while making the movie. And that was with the
machine having audio and video going full tilt, and typing in cast
credits. Not a small feat, considering how many times Mac users
have to restart their machines.
</P>
<P>
   There was one small, but rather irritating glitch: The software
is just complicated enough to need a manual. But the only
documentation is the electronic version contained in pull-down
menus with iMovie. There's an option to print out the various
chapters. Invoking that option crashed the computer, so I ended up
having to print each page of instruction. A hassle. The Apple
iMovie Web site, however, has some good tutorials you can work
through. And I'm sure an iMovie how-to book is in the works
somewhere (iMovie for Dummies?).

   In a desire by the Victorians to be warm and closer to the
fireplace, the club fender was born 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This eye-appealing bench spans the perimeter of the fireplace
hearth up to either the mantelpiece or against the wall on each
side of the mantle.
</P>
<P>
   It takes its name from the many private ``old guard'' clubs that
used them to grace their fireplaces.
</P>
<P>
   Club benches can be found in antiques shops or furniture stores,
or they can be custom-made. The average cost is $1,200 to $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Watson in New York manufactures 18th- and 19th-century
reproduction English furniture and distributes Original Club
Fenders Limited designed by Robin Gage in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Club fenders are intended for use by any fireplace in any room
in the house,'' said Gage by telephone from the United Kingdom.
``You can use them in the library, billiard room and bedroom.''
</P>
<P>
   The standard height of a club fender is 21 inches, and there are
usually three seat widths to select from.
</P>
<P>
   A club fender can be all one height or feature a cutout (dip) in
the center for a clear view of the fire from other parts of the
room. These upright members vary in design, from rectangular to
U-shaped or semi-circular or semi-ovoid.
</P>
<P>
   The main body of the bench is constructed of brass or steel,
brushed or with other finishes such as gunmetal or matte black.
</P>
<P>
   An optional lacquer coating will prevent brass fenders from
tarnishing or rusting, but scratches will show up.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of base designs and vertical columns, which add
interest to the structural design, are available.
</P>
<P>
   Vertical struts can be smooth, square, fluted, twisted or in a
rope pattern.
</P>
<P>
   You can create your own design by alternating column shapes or
their thickness.
</P>
<P>
   Vertical members can also feature mid-column finials in the
classical shapes of an acanthus leaf, a center twist, twisted cage
or Regency dart.
</P>
<P>
   Seating material is either tufted or smooth, hand-dyed leather
in bottle green, scarlet, butter yellow, jet black, plum, olive
green, blue, gold or shades of brown.
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer, you can also use your own material, horsehair or
suede. The front edge may also be finished with brass nailheads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about sparks,'' said Robert Ryan, owner of Smith &AMP;
Watson in New York. ``There are three spark guard finishes on the
inner side of the seat, which also keeps the leather from drying
out. But to keep a leather seat looking good and pliable, it should
be waxed at least once a year.''
</P>
<P>
   The phone number for Smith &AMP; Watson in New York is 212-686-6444.

 &HT;    GOLDEN DREAM OF A DEBT-FREE AMERICA NEARLY WITHIN REACH

5th grafs after optional trim.
 &HT;    920&AMP;add. With FEDBUD-DATA and FEDBUD-NUMBERS. For release

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton submits his 2001 budget
proposal to Congress on Monday, the last such exercise of his
career, he'll issue a challenge that seemed a pipe dream just a few
years ago: pay off the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   By 2013, Clinton claims, the country could be nearly debt-free
for the first time in 165 years.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, government borrowing would stop competing
with private enterprise for investment dollars, and American
taxpayers would no longer be strapped with annual interest payments
topping $220 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paying down the debt is an investment that we're making. It's
an investment in the future,'' said Alan Auerbach, professor of
economics and law at the University of California in Berkeley.
``It's a very wise and productive use of the budget surpluses,
certainly as compared to saying 'We have this money, let's find
other things to do with it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan, though, is as uncertain as it is ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   While decades of federal budget deficits have begun to
grudgingly give way to modest surpluses, no one can say whether the
the booming economy will continue to pour growing tax revenues into
government coffers. Even if it does, there's no guarantee that
federal spending will be held in close check.
</P>
<P>
   If these things don't happen, the surpluses needed to pay off
the roughly $3.3 trillion the government owes to banks and private
investors at home and abroad may never materialize.
</P>
<P>
   ``The range of possibilities is really quite substantial,''
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan testified before the
Senate Banking Committee two weeks ago, when asked how confident
planners could be in the surplus projections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crucial issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like others who closely study government finance, though,
Greenspan said paying off the debt is a noble goal that could
create manifest benefits for the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a great weight off the back of future
generations,'' said federal debt expert Robert Bixby, policy
director for the Concord Coalition, a Washington research group.
</P>
<P>
   Debt reduction could also help to keep the economy growing, said
the Treasury Department's Lee Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have the impact of exerting downward pressure on
interest rates,'' said Sachs, assistant secretary for financial
markets. ``That will be reflected in interest rates on things like
home mortgages, consumer loans, business loans, corporate bonds. It
will flow through the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Clinton estimates, a family that owes a bank $100,000
on a home mortgage is probably paying about $2,000 a year less in
interest than it would have if his administration had not reversed
the growth of deficits.
</P>
<P>
   The virtues of debt reduction have been touted for decades,
though mostly in vain.
</P>
<P>
   That's because only over the past two years have the White
House, which proposes the budget, and the Congress, which alone has
the power to levy taxes and spend those revenues, managed to bring
federal outlays in line with tax collections.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's surplus was a statistically negligible $1 billion _
not counting the massive Social Security program and the Postal
Service, which get special budgetary treatment and together ran a
surplus of nearly $124 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For the current fiscal year, which began last October, the
government is on track to run a surplus of about $23 billion _
again, not including Social Security and the Postal Service _
according to projections last month by the Congressional Budget
Office (CBO). That would be the largest federal budget surplus
ever, measured in dollars, and the largest in 49 years as a
percentage of the country's economic output.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton and the Republican-controlled Congress get some
credit, essentially for fighting each other to a draw that has
prevented large-scale spending hikes or tax cuts, neither gets any
medals from economists.
</P>
<P>
   Far more than any policy decisions made in Washington, they
point out, it's the windfall tax revenues generated by the
country's unprecedented economic expansion _ nine years long next
month _ that have turned decades of federal budget deficits into
surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason why the surplus accumulated,'' said Harvard
University economist Alberto Alesino, ``is because the economy is
doing so well that, even at constant tax rates, tax revenues have
gone up.''
</P>
<P>
   With more Americans working than ever before, baby boomers
sailing through their most productive years, overseas markets for
U.S. goods and services expanding, and businesses investing
hundreds of billions of dollars in new technology and
efficiency-enhancing equipment, the federal government will take in
a record $1.945 trillion in taxes this year.
</P>
<P>
   If the economy grows at a rate between 2.7 percent and 3 percent
a year over the next decade, surpluses are projected to pile up
somewhere between $800 billion and $1.9 trillion, the CBO projects,
depending on the kinds of tax and spending decisions made by the
White House and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and his Republican foes, for example, are pressing
for election-year tax cuts. Clinton's budget will propose $350
billion worth of cuts over 10 years, aimed at helping low- and
middle-income families. Republicans have proposed other plans that
are less targeted and would trim revenues more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of the variant,'' CBO Director Dan Crippen
testified last month before the Senate Budget Committee, ``the
budgetary picture is a bright one.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Since the country's founding, the U.S. government, like most
large enterprises, has had to manage debt.
</P>
<P>
   In 1835, President Andrew Jackson helped tamp down the debt to a
record low of $33,733.05 _ about what the federal government now
spends every six-tenths of a second _ but he never completely wiped
it out.
</P>
<P>
   In the last half of this century, however, deficit spending
became a bad habit for Washington. Last year was the first since
1969 that the government was in the black.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a federal debt totalling about $5.8
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Of that, $2.5 trillion is money the government essentially owes
to itself. This is money held in trust funds by dozens of federal
programs. These range from Social Security, which currently holds a
staggering $936.4 billion in its trust fund, to the tiny $1 million
held in trust by the Office of Naval Records and History Fund.
</P>
<P>
   By law, these federal trust funds must be invested in U.S.
government debt, issued as Treasury bonds, notes and bills. Each is
essentially a form of promissory note, issued by the government
when it needs to borrow money, and secured by the full faith and
credit of the U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Treasury is simply paying interest on this debt to
other federal agencies, such payments are, in an accounting sense,
transfers within the government, not an outflow of cash.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining $3.3 trillion of federal debt, however, is held by
private banks and investors. Servicing this so-called publicly held
debt cost U.S. taxpayers $230 billion last year, about 12 cents out
of every federal dollar spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interest payments on the national debt amount to the third
largest item in the budget,'' said Sachs. ``If we didn't have debt,
and didn't have to pay interest on that debt, that's money that is
otherwise available.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed, for instance, that the interest savings
from debt reduction be somehow shoveled into the Social Security
trust fund. That, he said, could generate enough cash to extend the
solvency of the program at least 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is constantly paying down debt. It did so
even through the darkest of the deficit years such as 1992, when
the government spent as much as $290 billion more than it took in
through taxes.
</P>
<P>
   During years of large deficits, however, the government had to
borrow more money than it paid back to lenders, much like a
homeowner who manages to make the monthly mortgage payments, yet
continues to pile up credit card charges. That's what caused the
national debt to swell.
</P>
<P>
   The government continues to borrow money, by issuing Treasury
bills, notes and bonds. It has begun reducing both the number of
auctions for the sale of these securities, and the volume of IOUs
that it issues at each.
</P>
<P>
   As its borrowing requirements decline, the Treasury has begun
paying off more debt than it is assuming, again, much as a
homeowner might begin nibbling away at household credit card debt,
even while paying down the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   During the current quarter, for example, the Treasury Department
will pay off $17 billion more than it will borrow. During April,
May and June, the Treasury Department estimates that it will pay
down a record $152 billion more than it will borrow. That's the
quarter when revenues tend to come in fastest, owing to the tax
collection calendar.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is projected to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is now a consensus among private sector and government
forecasters that these paydowns will grow in the future,'' Treasury
Under Secretary for Domestic Finance, Gary Gensler, told reporters
last week in announcing the Treasury Department's plan for trimming
its borrowing.

LEARNING HOW TO BE `AS BRAVE AS THE CHILDREN' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Alan and Susan Raymond have hauled their cameras
and sound equipment into a number of dicey, if not downright
dangerous, situations _ prison, the South Bronx, one of
Philadelphia's poorest inner-city schools.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing prepared the Academy Award-winning documentary
filmmakers for what they would face when they traveled to four
war-ravaged areas to interview the most innocent victims and
survivors, the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning when they would tell the story of seeing
their parents die or other horrific things, I would start to cry,''
Susan explained recently. ``Then I would look at the child, and the
child was not crying. He would be completely dry-eyed, just telling
us what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a struggle, but I had to learn to be as brave as the
children. I think the children we met showed incredible bravery and
courage.''
</P>
<P>
   During 1995 and '96 the Raymonds, who live in Columbia County
south of here, went to Bosnia, Israel, Rwanda and Northern Ireland
to capture firsthand the devastating impact that conflicts have had
on young people. Their powerful, disturbing film, ``Children in
War,'' recently appeared on HBO, which commissioned the film.
</P>
<P>
   Civilians, especially children, bear the brunt of modern-day
wars. It is estimated that 90 percent of the casualties in the four
areas the Raymonds visited are civilians, compared with 50 percent
who were civilian casualties in World War II. In just the past
decade, 2 million children have been killed in wars throughout the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our film carries with it a fairly strong human-rights
message,'' Alan Raymond observed. ``The rights of children are
being violated in all four of these areas. People should be more
aware of this, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Children in War'' is not easy to watch. You are indeed struck
by the matter-of-fact recounting by children of recent events that
will no doubt leave them scarred physically and emotionally for the
rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Janel, a 12-year-old Bosnian boy sitting outdoors next
to his sister in the ravaged city of Mostar. He has survived a
shelling that disabled him and killed his father. Yet there is
neither anger nor grief in his voice as he explains what they have
endured.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shell has no eyes. It's not personal,'' the blond boy
tells the Raymonds through an interpreter. ``It's very difficult to
live in war. You just wait for the moment you are going to die.''
</P>
<P>
   When Susan Raymond asks Janel if he would mind showing them how
the shell injured his arm, the boy almost proudly takes his right
hand and reaches under the collar of his sweater and T-shirt to
remove what remains of his left arm, a stump that looks more like a
fin than an arm.
</P>
<P>
   In Rwanda, where some 300,000 children lost their lives during a
three-month genocidal onslaught as the Hutus attempted to wipe out
the Tutsis, elementary-school-age boys were recruited to be
soldiers. Children the Raymonds spoke with told of hiding in the
bushes and watching as their parents were mutilated.
</P>
<P>
   One young boy, running his fingers over the scars across the top
of his head, looks into the camera and says: ``They cut me with a
machete and killed me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Children in War'' is the 13th film the husband-and-wife team
have filmed and produced during the past 25 years. Their HBO
special, ``I Am a Promise: The Children of Stanton Elementary
School,'' won a 1994 documentary feature Oscar (along with an Emmy,
a Du Pont Award, a Peabody Award and a Robert F. Kennedy Journalism
Award), though it may not be their best-known work.
</P>
<P>
   The Raymonds are the filmmakers of the 12-hour 1971 PBS series
on the Loud clan, ``An American Family,'' which became a milestone
in television history for its revealing portrait of middle-class
American life. They also made the gritty 1976 documentary ``The
Police Tapes,'' a portrait of an embattled Bronx police precinct
that Steven Bochco credited as the model for his hit TV series
``Hill Street Blues.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raymonds spent most of the past three years editing
``Children in War,'' work they are able to do in their home, as
well as preparing a companion book being published next month by
HarperCollins. They also have started on their next documentary:
children with learning disabilities such as dyslexia and
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Alan, a New York City native, and Susan, who hails from Chicago,
have lived full-time in southeastern Columbia County for more than
a decade. Although they are documentary filmmakers, the two are
surprisingly uncomfortable being in the spotlight themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They are in their mid-50s but did not want to give their ages.
They asked that the town they live in not be identified and that
the name and age of their young son also not be printed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not comfortable with that kind of personal background. It
doesn't make me happy,'' Susan said. ``I like to be low-profile.
That's how you make the films. You stay low-profile.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Raymonds were decidedly less low-profile 20 years ago, when
they were featured in a three-page photo story in People magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Alan, the son of an economics professor and a former opera
singer, graduated from New York University's film school, where his
classmates included Martin Scorsese and Brian DePalma. Alan was at
work in Chicago in 1965 on a promotional film for Playboy magazine
when he met Susan, an anthropology major at DePaul University.
</P>
<P>
   Alan was subletting Susan's sister's apartment, and Susan
stopped by to borrow a typewriter. ``It was very Neil
Simon-esque,'' Alan said, while Susan described their meeting as
``hate at first sight.'' They married the following year.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Recipes of a lifetime
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ For the past half-century and then some, Mary
Caldwell has been Lufkin's very own Martha Stewart of down-home
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Her special dishes _ most everything from hot tamales to hot
water cornbread _ have fed five generations of families, beginning
with our grandmothers and continuing through our grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   And though now in her 80s, Mary is still cooking for friends and
family.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way she wants it, and her granddaughter, Shirley
Caldwell-Ross, agrees _ though there was a time when she didn't.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Shirley begged her grandmother to live with her out
in California where she could take care of her.
</P>
<P>
   But no, Mary insisted that she stay in her own little cottage by
the railroad tracks, her yard the prettiest in the neighborhood and
her house always neat as a pin.
</P>
<P>
   Her granddaughter has finally come around, and even come back to
Texas, making her home in a suburb near Fort Worth, close enough to
visit regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want her to cook as long as she can,'' Shirley said. ``It
gives her a reason to get up every morning, and that's important.''
</P>
<P>
   The granddaughter wants something else, too _ to collect Mary's
recipes for a book.
</P>
<P>
   She thought it wouldn't be that hard. It turns out it won't be
that easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of her recipes she keeps in her head,'' Shirley said.
``And she's very protective of them.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is that the granddaughter has invited Mary to spend
several weeks with her. That way they can work together in the
kitchen, Mary making her wonderful dishes _ her chili, her beef
stew, her chicken and dumplings, her array of pies and cakes _ and
Shirley making notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a storehouse of vast information,'' Shirley said, ``and
I don't want her to leave this earth without it being recorded.''
</P>
<P>
   This, too: She wants Mary to know now how many dear friends she
still has, ``not wait until it's time for a eulogy to say what's in
our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the recipe book, Shirley will include cards and
letters from her grandmother's admirers, many of whom will remember
her as Lufkin's Tea Cake Lady when she went door to door selling
pastries.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a sample peek, Mary Caldwell's recipe for hot water
cornbread:
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients: 2 cups yellow corn meal, 1 1/2 tsp. salt, 1 tsp.
sugar, 2 2/3 cups boiling water, medium bowl of cold water.
</P>
<P>
   Mix all dry ingredients together, add half the hot water, stir
well, add remaining hot water a little at a time, stir until
mixture is wet. Consistency should be thick yet easily stirred.
</P>
<P>
   Use deep fryer or skillet, one-third full of vegetable oil, heat
to 350 degrees. Oil is ready when small amount of mixture is
dropped in and it sizzles and floats to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Use cold water to moisten inside of hands. This also helps to
diffuse heat from mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Scoop spoonful of mixture into hands and form into smooth oval
shape.
</P>
<P>
   Place gently in skillet or deep fryer. Be sure not to let water
drop into grease.
</P>
<P>
   If using skillet, cook cornbread for 5 minutes on one side, turn
over and cook another 3 minutes for even browning. If using deep
fryer, entire mixture should be submerged for 8 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking times may vary depending on type of skillet or deep
fryer effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Color should be golden brown and cornbread will begin to float
in oil when done.
</P>
<P>
   Recipe yields 12 pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Eat your heart out, Martha Stewart.

COLLEGE MYSTIFIED BY $310 DONATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN  
 c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ These days, colleges will take money any way
they can get it. So when donors request a little privacy in turning
over fortunes to their favorite institutions, few questions are
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Skidmore College got a $5 million donation from an anonymous
donor in 1994. Similarly, no one officially knows the identity of
the generous patron who gave $100 million to Cornell University
last year, one of its largest donations ever.
</P>
<P>
   So what was Union College to make of its latest anonymous gift,
delivered in an unremarkable white envelope just before Christmas?
</P>
<P>
   First of all, it was sent in cash, a large stack of tens and
twenties. Then there was the amount, $310, which had an uncanny
``Price is Right''-style precision to it, and none of the nice
zeros fund-raisers yearn for.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, college officials saw no mystery to the identity of
the donor. That changed when a new secretary in the finance office
got a call back from alumni records showing they had no student by
the name ``Pen I. Tent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Oh, my God,''' said Diane Blake, vice president for
finance and administration, who quickly re-read the letter that
accompanied the cash.
</P>
<P>
   In simple, typewritten prose came the following, perhaps from a
former religion or English major with a heavy conscience and a
sense of humor: ``I did some physical damage to Union College
several years ago. I am sorry; please accept my apology. The
contents of the enclosed envelope is my attempt to cover the
damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there are no more clues to unravel the mystery.
Officials unwittingly threw out the envelope, leaving even the
postmark location unknown. Blake speculated the amount may stem
from an investigation of vandalism where the damage was assessed at
$310, but she said she was unaware of any such inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's laughable, really,'' she said. ``It all went so fast that
we didn't think to ask certain questions.''
</P>
<P>
   And, speaking of questions, what might $310 buy the college?
</P>
<P>
   ``A library book or two,'' said Blank. ``Those things are pretty
expensive.''

PROGRAM SEEKS TO END TECHNOLOGY GAP BETWEEN RICH, POOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Julie Henderson is a true believer in the push
to close the digital divide between needy and more affluent
families.
</P>
<P>
   The executive director of the Marcus Foster Institute, a
nonprofit organization that helps the poor learn job skills, smiles
broadly as she remembers the 21 mothers and fathers walking out the
institute's door two weeks ago, carrying their new computers.
</P>
<P>
   It was like ``giving candy to a baby,'' Henderson said of the
computer giveaway, the first test of ClickStart, a new federally
funded program aimed at providing Internet access to the poor. ``It
was an incredible moment in their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 percent of American households have computers. But
according to the National Telecommunications and Information
Administration, 8 percent of American households earning under
$10,000 have computers, and only 3 percent of those homes have
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration wants to provide a $50 million
subsidy so poor families can buy computers and get Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ClickStart is the brainchild of Silicon Valley executives Wade
Randlett, co-founder of TechNet, a political lobbying organization
for the technology industry, and Garrett Gruener, a venture
capitalist and the founder of Ask Jeeves, the Internet search
engine.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, the U.S. Department of Commerce will issue
monthly vouchers, worth $10 each, to households that meet the
requirements for receiving food stamps. These qualifying households
must provide $5. The $15 is then paid to a company to provide a
low-cost computer and basic Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ClickStart is aimed at reaching 300,000 households initially.
Its founders hope to get computers and Internet accounts into most
of the 9 million poor households that lack computers or Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still work to be done on this,'' Randlett said, adding
that some details have to worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a debate about the effectiveness of providing
computers to people for whom food, employment, housing and
education are a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Stoll, the author of ``High Tech Heretic: Why Computers
Don't Belong in Schools,'' called the ClickStart program ``bogus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What poor families and their children need are better schools,
more teachers and good books. They don't need to be sitting in
front of glowing screens.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Silicon Valley executives like Randlett and Garrett,
there is no argument over the benefits of bridging a digital
divide. They believe that giving these tools to the disadvantaged
will help enrich the needy.
</P>
<P>
   Access to computers and the Internet ``opens the doors to the
wonder world'' Garrett said Wednesday. A family without the
Internet, he declared, is ``fundamentally disabled.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment is echoed by Henderson, who sees computers and
the on-line world as a virtual bootstrap for the poor, helping them
look for jobs, seek health care information and begin home-grown
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the first words I heard from someone in our program was
that she was going to sell her T-shirts on the Internet,'' said
Henderson. ``That's empowerment.''

 UNDATED: ... for the kids.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not all are still in Lakeland to play on it. His brother and
sisters now live with him in Maryland because ``Ray loves kids,''
said Miller. ``They have their own level. It's like they have their
own house in his house.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighbors are not surprised. Randy Jachman says that unlike
several other pro athletes who live in the development of 2-acre
lots, Lewis is a magnet for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a pool, and they can go swimming there if they want,''
said Jachman. ``The kids make a big deal of it when they see him,
and he's always very nice about it. They can go up to him and say,
`Ray, would you autograph this?' He'll do it without even blinking.
Anyone in the neighborhood, child or adult, who came by his house,
he couldn't have been nicer.''
</P>
<P>
   So considerate was he, Jachman remembers, that when Lewis moved
in last summer, he wanted to do so on his birthday so he could
throw a party. But he made a point of telling the neighbors _ many
of whom were invited _ ``Hey, if it gets too noisy, please let me
know.''
</P>
<P>
   The only neighborhood nitpick was that some of the limousines of
the partygoers were parked on his lawn. Those aren't to be confused
with the limo he ordered each home football Sunday to transport his
family to Ravens games _ the same one that was at the scene of the
crime in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If he handled his wealth with aplomb, it was the same way he
accepted exalted status as a teenager.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was probably the best athlete I ever coached,'' said Joe.
``He had natural athletic ability, but he also had a tremendous
work ethic. He never took a practice off, and he'd get the other
kids fired up. He was a natural leader.''
</P>
<P>
   And linebacker, though that wasn't his initial calling. When Joe
arrived at Kathleen during Lewis's sophomore year, he was a strong
safety and wanted to stay there. But after Joe held his first
seven-on-seven scrimmage, ``we moved him up,'' said the former
coach. ``There was no question from then on what he was going to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't Lewis's preference. ``He came up and said he wanted
to be a defensive back,'' said Joe. ``I told him, `(Linebacker) is
where we need you.' And there was never another word about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In wrestling, it was no different. ``He was a physical-type kid
who liked contact, liked the challenge,'' said Poole. ``He was like
a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis finished fourth in the state in his first year of
competition as a sophomore, second as a junior, and then he became
Kathleen's first Florida champion.
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of the feat, a 4-by-8-foot portrait of Lewis
hangs in the school gym.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was a plugger in the classroom, a B and C student,
according to Poole. Morrell, who taught him history, recalled that
``he was always a disciplined kid who did what he needed to do,''
though ``sitting around my class, I'd hardly ever catch him into
talking.''
</P>
<P>
   That would change after Lewis went to Miami, where he arrived
only after a mighty academic struggle _ five cracks at his college
boards before he passed them in July, too late to qualify for a
preseason scholarship. But he remained loyal to Tuberville, who had
maintained his interest despite Lewis's qualifying difficulties,
and arrived at the Coral Gables campus as a technical walk-on, then
was awarded a scholarship his first day there, which is allowed
under NCAA rules.
</P>
<P>
   Right then, Lewis showed his first flashes of bravado. ``He got
into the Miami thing,'' Tuberville said of the mighty Hurricane
swagger that prevailed in the mid-'90s. ``He made the statement,
`I'm going to be the best linebacker ever to play at Miami.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sure. He wasn't even supposed to play much his first year. No
freshman had started at linebacker during Dennis Erickson's tenure
as head coach. And those ahead of the newcomer on the depth chart
included future pros Jessie Armstead, Micheal Barrow, and Darrin
Smith. But when starter Bernard Clark was injured during the second
game of the season, Lewis stepped in. Then came his first start _
against a Colorado team that boasted quarterback Kordell Stewart,
wide receiver Michael Westbrook, and Heisman Trophy running back
Rashaan Salaam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had concerns about starting a true freshman at middle
linebacker against that offense,'' said Tuberville.
</P>
<P>
   But no regrets after the 35-29 Miami victory. ``He made 19
tackles and was named Player of the Game,'' said Tuberville. ``He
started every game after that. And after a few games, you could
tell he was something special.''
</P>
<P>
   After his sophomore year, Lewis visited some friends in
Mulberry, Fla., and dropped by the high school, where Fryzel was
now head coach and Morrell his assistant. At Fryzel's request,
Lewis delivered a motivational talk to the team. ``He was a lot
better speaker than I thought he'd be,'' said Morrell.
</P>
<P>
   It became something of a habit. To this day when he returns to
Florida, Lewis regularly will address church and school groups.
</P>
<P>
   During that stopover, he also told Fryzel something that
impressed the coach to no end. ``He told me he was going to school
during the summers because he wanted to graduate early and go to
the NFL,'' recalled Fryzel. ``When he left that day, I said, `Now
there's a kid who's got it all together.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis indeed turned pro after his junior year, though he's still
a few credits short of his degree in arts and sciences. By the time
he left, there also were a couple of smudges on his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1994, McCall, pregnant with their first child, filed
a complaint in which she alleged that Lewis struck her in the face
and wrapped his hands around her neck during an argument. She
declined to press charges and remains in Lewis's life.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1995, while allegedly trying to serve as peacemaker
during a campus parking lot argument between McCall and his former
girlfriend, Kimberlie Arnold _ who was four months pregnant with a
child Lewis's aunt insists was proven not to be his _ he was
accused of grabbing and scratching Arnold's right arm. But Coral
Gables police declined to file charges of aggravated battery.
</P>
<P>
   And last Nov. 30 _ four years after he had immediately
established himself as a force in the middle of the Ravens defense,
leading the team in tackles each season and the NFL in that
category twice _ Lewis encountered more trouble at the Windsor Inn
Crab House. A patron, Katrice S. Parker, filed a criminal complaint
accusing him of punching her and then leaving the scene.
</P>
<P>
   But Deputy State's Attorney Howard Merker indicated Thursday
that he may not pursue charges because of ``a number of witnesses
brought to me by Ray Lewis's attorney who suggested he may not have
been involved.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the police report described the alleged assailant
as about 5 feet 6 inches, 160 pounds; Lewis is 6-1, 240. Merker has
asked Parker's attorney, A. Dwight Pettit _ who did not return
calls from the Globe Thursday _ to provide witness testimony
corroborating her claim, which he said he would do.
</P>
<P>
   Ange Jordan, a Windsor Inn bartender who was on duty that night,
supports Lewis's innocence.
</P>
<P>
   On the night in question, she recalled, Lewis was moving from
the bar area to the VIP room reserved for the players. ``They
interviewed about 15 employees, and we all had the same story,''
she said. ``There was a little pushing and shoving going on as he
walked around the corner to the VIP room. He walked into it but he
wasn't a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lewis's current predicament dwarfs those other situations.
Fellow players offer hopeful encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Ray didn't do it,'' said Tampa Bay Buccaneers NFC Pro
Bowl defensive lineman Warren Sapp, Lewis's former Hurricane
teammate. ``It's just a situation where you pay the price for being
a recognizable face in a crowd when something goes down. I raised
him; I know better. He's just a good old country boy from Lakeland
who enjoys having a good time and going home to sleep. Dance you to
death in the club? Yes. Stab you to death? No way.''
</P>
<P>
   While the jury remains out on that, Lewis can ruefully testify
to the wisdom of Dale Fryzel's words back in those innocent high
school days.

JOHN MCENROE RELISHES HIS ROLE AS CAPTAIN AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ ``Capt. McEnroe, I presume?''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow a reporter finding John Patrick McEnroe Jr. deep in the
heart of Africa feels that in addressing the onetime wayward
wonderboy of American tennis, he should resort to the undying words
of an earlier correspondent, Henry Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, on a pretty fair expense account with the New York
Herald in 1871 (boat fare, porters, camping gear, gunbearers,
cooks, wagons, oxen, guides for his long bush-beating journey),
thought he was unearthing and rescuing the renowned
missionary-explorer, Dr. David Livingstone, at Ujiji in what was
Tanganyika. Spencer Tracy probably made Stanley and the occasion
look better than life as he uttered, ``Dr. Livingstone, I
presume?'' for the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the disappeared Dr. L. said, ``Who else would I be?''
isn't recorded. But he did advise Stanley that he wasn't lost,
thank you, and likely asked the reporter to stay for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe, the newly ordained missionary of US tennis as Davis Cup
captain, isn't lost in the jungle, either. Yet. But he evokes
another Spencer Tracy film: ``Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.''
</P>
<P>
   Which will Mac be on the bench during this weekend's opening
test against Zimbabwe _ the calm, caring healer Jekyll, or the
venomous, raving Hyde?
</P>
<P>
   That consideration and apprehension about how he'd handle an
essentially diplomatic role have kept him away from the job he's
coveted since he quit playing in the big league eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It appears a gamble, and the gambler is US Tennis Association
president Julia Levering, who chose him to succeed temperate Tom
Gullikson. Maybe because she was considered a bit of a gamble
herself as USTA boss, an original, a female after 118 years of male
rule, she took the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave it a lot of thought,'' she said, ``and we won't know if
something will go wrong unless or if it does. There may be blips,
but I think John is mature enough now (at 40 with six children) to
control himself. Why did I choose him? Because the players wanted
him. Yes,'' she smiled, ``I consulted them and took their advice,''
a startling tactic in light of past USTA presidents.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 guy, Andre Agassi, said, ``It's good to have John with us.
He's been here, been through it. He gives you confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Mac said, ``It's good to be back'' in the team atmosphere he
last shared with the Cup winners of 1992. ``But very different.
Then, as a player, I could let my competitiveness and fire flow on
the court. I don't know what it'll be like sitting there beside the
court. I think of it as being a parent instead of one of the kids.
Offering guidance that may or may not be taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``But am I going to advise Agassi?'' he chuckled, his
lichen-green eyes amused, graying head shaking. ``A guy whose
playing is a miracle? But maybe I can help Chris Woodruff, keep him
calm and focused, like my first captain, Tony Trabert, did with me
as a rookie (winning the 1978 Cup). Maybe add 5 to 10 percent there
that could be the difference. I hope so.''

   As the 37th in the line of American captains that stretches back
to the Cup donor, Harvard student Dwight Davis in 1900, McEnroe
faces a tougher baptism than any of his predecessors. In going
against Zimbabwe in the best-of-five first-round series that began
Friday, the captain will be trying to keep his crew cool in a
tin-roofed sauna called City Sports Centre, where 4,000 packed-in
loyalists, steaming with patriotic fervor, will be screaming for
Black power _ that's the diminutive Black brothers, Byron and Wayne
_ to make the Yankees go home unhappily.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a century of American Davis Cupping, the
captain is as much the story as any of the players. Possibly more
so. Reporters from abroad and more Americans than usual have made
the trek to the tropics to see if Mac can transfer genius with
racket to his troops, keep them from folding as he operates from a
folding chair. Although McEnroe was an itinerant international
incident on behalf of the USA, his brilliance and willingness to
enlist anytime, anywhere earned forgiveness for frequent outrages.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm the story it's OK from the standpoint that I've wanted
to be in this job to call attention to Davis Cup, to help bring it
up to where it belongs, at the top of the game with the majors.
Tennis is making a comeback after some low years, and I think Davis
Cup can add to that, and that young players should learn about the
traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Sampras and others didn't. But mama made sure little Johnny
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was becoming a pretty good junior,'' said Kay McEnroe,
``I made John promise me he'd go to a good college, and he'd play
for his country if he was asked. Well, he went to Stanford, if for
only a year. And he played when some didn't (notably Jimmy
Connors). I'm very proud to see him as captain.''
</P>
<P>
   Mom wasn't the only inspiration. Harry Hopman, the most
successful of all captains, steering Australia to 16 Cups, was a
huge influence on the young Long Islander after emigrating to the
United States to head the Port Washington Tennis Academy. Hopman,
who threw Mac out a couple of times for unseemly behavior (but
always took him back), preached the joys of Davis Cup. He never
would have tolerated a McEnroe on his teams loaded with those of
the immaculately behaved Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall, and Roy Emerson's
ilk. But Hop was so taken by the kid's artistry and moxie that he
excused McEnroe with, ``He's not so brash. But he's not docile.
It's just that he's a New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All tickets were gone in a twinkling for the weekend scrap that
has excited this ex-British colonial city (once Salisbury,
Rhodesia), and its foremost citizen, the republic's president,
Robert Mugabe. He calls it: ``Historic . . . momentous. The first
United States Davis Cup visit to our continent. The first time we
have played against them in anything. It's us dwarfs against the
giant . . . but we relish the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Seldom does a head of state show for such rites, a draw ceremony
on the eve of battle. But Mugabe was the host Thursday, beneath a
tent in his yard, the lush garden of the State House with lily pond
and towering trees. He brought his imposing wife, Grace (for whom a
military band played ``Amazing Grace''), to pluck the first name
from a cup. That was Black the younger (26-year-old Wayne) to
oppose Agassi at the start, leaving Black the elder (30-year-old
Byron) to deal with the novitiate, Chris Woodruff.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear that one leader on the world stage wanted to meet
another as 75-year-old Mugabe strode to McEnroe with extended hand.
McEnroe grasped it, nodding gravely, rather charitably. Mac has had
better years than Mug, realizing that the pressure on himself is
negligible compared to that dogging a man whose country is racked
by AIDS, 57 percent inflation, a gasoline shortage, 50 percent
unemployment, and numerous other difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``This isn't as easy as I thought it would be when I took
the job,'' McEnroe mused. ``The main thing was to talk Andre
(Agassi) and Pete (Sampras) into playing again. I did. Then Pete
got hurt, Todd Martin got sick, and I was making a lot of phone
calls to put together practically a new team.''
</P>
<P>
   As missionary McEnroe seeks to spread the gospel of Davis Cup _
``I want it to be as big as the majors'' _ as well as guide his
homeland to its first Cup since 1995, he is blessed with the
presence of Agassi: a man who plays strings as melodically as any
angel. But who else? Although he's worth two points, Andre can't
beat Zimbabwe by himself. Where is the third point to come from? A
sure-to-be-quaking No. 51 Woodruff? An untried doubles combo of
Alex O'Brien and 35-year-old Rick Leach?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the other side _ who cares? Zimbabwe? A remote
outpost with two players? Only two. From one household. But they
happen to be the slight but slick Blacks, who happen also to be
All-Americans of the University of Southern California variety,
seasoned pros with the ability to beat anybody, as Wayne nearly
tipped Sampras in five sets at the recent Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
   Mere mention of their names gives Australian captain John
Newcombe migraines. Byron and Wayne (called the ``Mighty Midgets''
by their uncle, Alastair Black) blackballed Newc's team two years
ago on an Australian lawn, a feat practically unheard of, and last
year shook them up here as Byron led off by flooring Mark
Philippoussis. Patrick Rafter led a comeback to a 4-1 victory, and
the Aussies went on to seize the Cup. But Zimbabwe is Z-rated as
far as Newc is concerned. Only Vijay and Anand Amritraj put on a
better brother act during the professional era, taking India to Cup
finals in 1974 and 1987.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe is concerned, as he should be. ``I think we have the
better players, but it's who handles the Cup pressure _ the
unknowable factor _ is what it's all about.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a rumor that seemed to take on a life of its own: the
Statue of Liberty, the preeminent symbol of freedom for people
across the world, was really a reminder of this country's darkest
past _ slavery.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three years, the tale has spread like wildfire
around the world, sweeping across the Internet, becoming more
dramatic with claims that the face of Lady Liberty was that of a
black woman. Inquiries jammed the phone lines of New York museums,
the French Embassy, and e-mail boxes of black professors. Last
year, it even was mentioned as fact during a McDonald's commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by French sculptor Frederic Auguste Bartholdi the
statue was shipped in 241 crates to the United States and erected
on an Island in New York harbor in 1886. It quickly became a beacon
to tens of millions of immigrants arriving from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But just what France meant to commemorate with the statue
remains fogged by time. And the strong support for abolition of
slavery among the French, and the fact that the gift arrived just
two decades after the US Civil War, have led many people to believe
that the gift was in honor of emancipation.
</P>
<P>
   Now the mystery is beginning to unravel. Rebecca Joseph, a
Boston anthropologist who was commissioned by the National Parks
Service to investigate the issue, is preparing a report that many
hope will be the last word in a long story.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph, 39, senior anthropologist for the park service's
Northeast region, is bracing for criticism on both sides of the
controversy once her findings are released _ but hinting that the
rumors may turn out to have at least some basis in fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those critics who want the findings to support a more
traditional story of the Statue of Liberty will be disappointed,''
said Joseph. ``And those who want the findings to support the idea
that what we have always said about the statue is wrong will also
be disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth, Joseph says, lies somewhere in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are trying to get to is what is the kernel of truth
and do those truths open the door to more interesting stories,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, Joseph has traced the rumors on the
Internet and collected old documents and memoirs from Harvard
University, the Boston Public Library, and the Liberty Foundation
in New York, among other sources. While books and encyclopedias all
claim the statue was given to the United States as a token of
friendship, Joseph says the French never gave a definite reason for
the gift of the copper statue.
</P>
<P>
   The commonly held view was that the statue represents the shared
faith in democracy between the two countries. But some historians
believe the message was more pointed.
</P>
<P>
   Edouard-Rene Lefebvre de Laboulaye, a 19th Century French
scholar and politician, conceived of the idea for a statue as a
gift to America from the French people. Laboulaye was also an
abolitionist who cared deeply about the black cause.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier designs of the statue face, some authors and historians
maintain, are those of an unnamed African woman. An early design
model had a broken chain in the statue's hands, which was later
replaced by the tablet. The final, 152-foot-tall version of the
statue has chains around its feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you can't look at the chains on the feet and say this had
nothing to do with slavery,'' said Edie Shean-Hammond, director of
communications for the Northeast region of the park service. ``Our
goal is to tell the whole story, to understand what the social
context was when these events took place.''
</P>
<P>
   As anticipation for the report continues to grow, so does a
simmering controversy among scholars, writers, and historians about
the interpretation of a symbol that has long been seen as a
welcoming figure to immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you are dealing with an issue that might change the
way we interpret history, it is going to be controversial,'' said
Diane Dayson, superintendent of the Statue of Liberty Monument and
Ellis Island.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of the matter is not whether the rumor is true,
argued Pat Turner, a folklorist and author of ``I Heard it through
the Grapevine: Rumors in the African American Culture,'' but the
fact that so many African-Americans are concerned about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this tendency of blacks to believe that lots of their
contributions to this country have been overlooked, so whenever a
piece of information seems hidden, it is further evidence of our
erasure from history,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia historian Calvin Robinson, 77, said his
grandmother, who lived during the time of the statue's
construction, often talked about the statue being a black woman and
a celebration of abolition.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson co-wrote ``The Journey of the Songhai People,'' a book
that some believe helped fuel the tale. The book not only asserts
that the stattue initially was modeled from the face of an
unidentified African woman, but that it also is a commemoration of
black soldiers who fought in the Revolutionary War. Robinson offers
only scant documentation for his claims, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so upset at the ease at which this erroneous information
on the Internet has been passed around. . . . It's disgraceful,''
said Lee Daniels, who is black. Daniels is editor of Opportunity
Magazine, published by the National Urban League.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Haskins, professor of English at the University of Florida
in Gainesville, who has been falsely named on the Internet as the
author of Robinson's book, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no black woman who was the model of the Statue of
Liberty,'' said Haskins, who is black and the former southeastern
chairman of the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Both Haskins and Daniels agree, however, that the impetus of the
statue was to commemorate the abolition of slavery. The face, they
say, was that of the sculptor's mother, Auguste Charlotte
Bartholdi, and the body is of his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the damn Internet is the most dangerous thing in the
damn world,'' Haskins said. ``I get 80 e-mails about this rumor a
day. Now McDonald's a year ago ran a commercial about it _ it's all
trash.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Dwoir-Srecaut, a librarian for the French Embassy in
Washington, said that each day he has to squash hopes of the black
callers trying to confirm their link to the statue. ``Maybe some
day they will find a document . . . but unfortunately it's now in
the realm of science fiction,'' Dwoir-Srecaut said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the stories grow, seemingly gaining embellishment with
every retelling.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's co-author on ``The Journey of the Songhai People,''
Redmand Battles, said the original design for the facial bust was
returned to Bartholdi and refined after Americans were offended by
the thought of a black woman's face towering over New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Many have debunked Robinson's version, but Turner, the
folklorist, said years ago she received calls about a far-out rumor
that Thomas Jefferson fathered a child by a black woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now,'' she said, ``DNA shows that could be true.''

ALTERNATIVES TO EXPENSIVE SLATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, February 6, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My slate roof is 65 years old and is leaking. A roofer
offered to replace the slate for $70,000. I'd like to keep the
slate, but $70,000, that's a big order. Is there a way to keep the
old slate and fix the leaks?
</P>
<P>
   T.K., Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Ah yes, a nice old house with a slate roof. Often someone
buys a nice old house and discovers the slate roof is 50 to 100
years old and leaks. Fixing leaks on a slate roof is expensive.
</P>
<P>
   You have three choices. One is to remove the slate intact,
remove the slater's felt (it's like tarpaper, and does the
waterproofing), and replace that. Put the old slates back, provided
they are in good shape. Most slate will last several hundred years;
some inferior grades last only 50 years. You can hope yours are the
good type. This will be expensive, but not as expensive as
replacing the slate.
</P>
<P>
   The second alternative will drive the purists and some
architects bananas because it is not the thing to do on an old
house, especially one with a slate roof. And that is to remove the
slate and put on good old asphalt shingles that will last maybe 30
years or so. That is heresy, but a lot less expensive. Hey, it's
your house.
</P>
<P>
   The third alternative is to do nothing, and put lots of pots and
pans in the attic to catch the drips. You have to be alert to this:
After placing the pots and pans in the attic during one rainstorm,
check their location during the next rainstorm. You might find that
you'll have to rearrange all the pots and pans.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We are getting mold our wood windows. We had the house vinyl
sided, and replaced our windows. What can we do? Someone suggested
venting the attic more, but we have new vents and the attic is dry.
Now what?
</P>
<P>
   PATRICIA POWERS, Beverly, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Your problem is moisture, and it is an old wives' tale that
venting the attic is going to solve such problems. Venting the
attic will vent the attic, not the house. It might help some, but
is not a cure-all. Part of the problem is the vinyl siding and the
new windows. The siding and the windows have tightened up the
house. That's good to save heat, but it allows the house to retain
water vapor that condenses on the wood window because it is cool,
and with this moisture mold won't be far behind. It is OK to
tighten up the house, but not OK to allow mold to grow. Therefore,
to reduce the moisture, ventilate it just as you ventilated the
attic, only not so much: Open windows for 10 minutes twice a day.
You will lose little heat while reducing the moisture and
eliminating the conditions in which mold grows.
</P>
<P>
   Since your house is tight enough to retain water vapor, consider
putting in an air-to-air het exchanger, a ventilator that exhausts
house air and brings in fresh, outside air, transfering the heat of
the house air to the incoming air.
</P>
<P>
   Kill the mold by washing with a solution of one part bleach and
three parts water.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I took off my shower stall doors, and now there are holes in
the fiberglass. A man offered to fix them for $250. Can I fix them
for less?
</P>
<P>
   KATHY BOYD, Georgetown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Patching fiberglass is expensive, but you can avoid that.
Cover the holes with clear tape (not Scotch tape, it is too tender
for this purpose), then paint the tape to match the fiberglass. You
can buy thin, clear tape that can be sanded to feather the edges.
An easier fix is to buy solid brass sheet-metal screws and screw
them into the holes. You could paint the screw heads or not. Being
solid brass, they won't rust.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have 30 wool outfits stored in a closed-in room. I am
concerned about moths. What can I do to keep moths away?
</P>
<P>
   JOAN HUTTON, Needham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Have the clothes drycleaned; the process demoths and keeps
moths away. You could hang moth cakes from the hanging pole, but
remember, moth crystals are toxic. Don't let the crystals touch the
fabric.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am refinishing my very dry basaement. I noticed a thin
skimcoat of plaster on the concrete foundation. What can I do with
that plaster, and what can I do with the foundation where there is
no plaster?
</P>
<P>
   KELLY BONNEVIE, West Roxbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If you don't plan to build a stud wall with insulation, you
can paint the plaster with two coats of a latex solid stain. For
the bare concrete, you can paint it with a cement-based paint, or
the latex solid stain. If you want to skimcoat it, use a Portland
cement-based mortar, not plaster, but be sure to apply a bonding
agent to the concrete first.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My landlord put a railing in a stairwell leading to my
apartment. I am moving now, but I cannot get furniture past the
railing. Can that railing be removed without damage?
</P>
<P>
   S.B., Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, if the railing was put on brackets screwed into the
studs behind the wall. That is the standard procedure. In fact,
instead of taking down railing and brackets, take the railing off
the brackets. That way you can get the furniture around the
brackets.

LET THEM COMPETE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Contrary to popular opinion, for-profit health care insurers are
not selling babies on the black market to pad their bottom lines.
And as best I can tell, they are not insisting that hospitals use
rejected body parts to cut transplant costs.
</P>
<P>
   But you would never know it by the way the for-profit insurers
are being villified these days in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Just yesterday the health maintainence organizations were the
attack dogs of health care. They denied care to dying kids. They
wouldn't let us see the specialists we needed. Need a shrink? Take
a number.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, with Harvard Pilgrim Health Care tettering on the edge
of the abyss, it and other nonprofit insurers are the cuddly
puppies of health care. With Harvard Pilgrim in need of a cash
infusion, the fear is that the barbarians _ those for-profit dogs _
are at the gates of the city.
</P>
<P>
   I, too, do not want to see Harvard Pilgrim sold to a for-profit
HMO, or to anyone else. As I have said more than once, I believe
Harvard Pilgrim has come back too far to lose it now. It is one of
the best health plans in the country, and it is worth saving. And I
think we're on course to do that.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the whole debate has turned into a rant against the
for-profits.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Franko, a finance professor at the University of
Massachusetts in Boston, can't help but wonder: ``If nonprofits are
the only virtuous organizations, why do we entrust our lives to
for-profit airline companies? Why do we buy our food from
for-profit markets?'
</P>
<P>
   Turn the rhetoric down, and the differences between the
nonprofit insurers and the for-profit insurers look far less than
advertised. To be successful, both have to deliver quality care at
reasonable prices. Neither one can continue to lose money and stay
in business.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than an either/or debate on HMOs, long term we would be
better served by developing a system of both strong nonprofits and
strong for-profits, each acting as a check on the other and
allowing consumers to choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strengths and weaknesses of both types would discipline
the other,'' says Jeremiah Cole, director of planning and
development for the state's division of medical assistance and a
veteran of both for-profit and nonprofit health care.
</P>
<P>
   Too much of our fear of for-profits is grounded in the unknown.
Our experience in New England is with nonprofit HMOs, which have
served us pretty well for three decades. Will the for-profits be
able to drive even tougher bargains with the already-hurting
hospitals? Don't count on it. The HMO that drives the toughest deal
is the one with the most customers. The vast majority of customers
here belong to the nonprofits, not because they are more virtuous
but because they got here first.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about those big HMO executive salaries? Efrem Sigel,
editor of the Managed Healthcare Market Report, says the chief
executives at the 20 publicly held HMOs made $35 million in
salaries and bonuses in 1998, on revenues of $94 billion. The
number looks pretty small viewed that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it gets the doctors all hot, but it is a bogus issue,''
Sigel says.
</P>
<P>
   Which reminds me: The docs complain about for-profit insurers
all the time, but then how many nonprofit doctors' practices do you
see? Precious few, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Profit,'' in fact, has become a dirty word through this
debate, and it shouldn't be. If the nonprofit Harvard Pilgrim had
kept a better eye on its bottom line, it would have been building
the reserves it needs to survive, not draining them. And it
wouldn't be in the mess it is today.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Herzlinger, a Harvard Business School professor, thinks
the whole debate about for-profits vs. nonprofits is misguided.
What the system needs is more accountability; what consumers need
is more information. They can get better information when shopping
for a blender for the kitchen than for a doctor for prostate
cancer, she says.
</P>
<P>
   She is dead right. Nonprofit vs. for-profit? What I need is a
choice and the information to make that choice. Right now I have
neither.

 HARARE, Zimbabwe: ... it's all about.''

<P>
   McEnroe felt that ``I might never get the job. After we won in
`92, the players told me to apply. They wanted me. But it wasn't
the right time. My personal problems (a divorce from Tatum O'Neal,
concerns for the children) were too distracting. I withdrew my
name. I'm ready now.''
</P>
<P>
   Complex guy. A man of many outward explosions and jams, he has
an inward reach for the right stuff with no window dressing. He was
among the first to help the saintly Andrea Jaeger in setting up a
ranch to entertain terminally ill kids. Two days ago, he went alone
to a slum to give lessons and encouragement to kids. ``Not many of
them had shoes,'' he said. ``They need help.''
</P>
<P>
   He has dedicated his coming-out party to the memory of two
former Davis Cuppers, one of his captains, Arthur Ashe, and Grand
Slammer Don Budge. The team will wear black armbands as a tribute
to Budge, who died two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   When Sampras (hip twinge) and Martin (viral infection) sent
regrets, the rookie captain found himself rooting around, and not
dealing with the usual suspects. Jim Courier and Michael Chang made
no hopeful impressions as first-round losers at the Australian and
Nicolas Escude and Roger Federer were not exactly overwhelming.
Likewise possible candidate Vince Spadea, who had made the 1999
Aussie quarters with an Agassi scalp.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe had to go to his Rolodex and the want-ads, and came up
with the earnest Tennessean, husky Woodruff. Woodruff won Newport,
R.I., last July, finished the year at No. 51, and had a fine
Australian Open: a fourth-round finish in a respectable performance
against Sampras (7-5, 6-3, 6-3) after eliminating 11th-seeded Tim
Henman.
</P>
<P>
   However, a Davis Cup debut, especially on the road, is
invariably tremble time. Ask Sampras about his coming-out party, a
1991 final-round disaster at Lyon, France, where the United States
was beaten, 3-1. It looked like a lock with an Agassi-Sampras
parlay against broken-down Henri Leconte and ordinary Guy Forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm cool. It's just a tennis match. I'm laid-back,'' said
Sampras, who had won a tour tournament only a few weeks before in
the same arena. Then he'd been an admired visitor. With the Cup at
stake, he was the enemy. The crowd started roaring, the small
building began rocking, and Sampras ``lost it completely.'' And
lost both matches. ``I found out about Davis Cup. It's totally
different, the pressure that doesn't exist in the tournaments where
you're on your own.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Ralston, a Cup winner as a US player and captain, said,
``Everything changes when you have USA on your jacket. Maybe nobody
knows you're representing the country _ but you do. You feel like
you're carrying a lot of people. Not just yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe atypically savored the mental load of Davis Cup as a
player. He was a big match guy. He was the indispensable man as the
United States won four Cups between 1978 and 1982, and said
farewell in a doubles cameo, important to winning the 1992 Cup.
During his record 12 years on the team, the United States went 26-4
with him in the lineup, unmatched by any other American.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, he could let it all hang out, screeching
insultingly at umpires, line judges, opponents, and spectators.
Exorcising the demons. He made bad scenes and good results, an
athlete who has maintained a hold on the public's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Capt. McEnroe, we presume, hoping to convert his
doubters, show that he belongs in charge. Crusading to find new
faithful for that aged crock, the 100-year-old tub that he has
loved and worshiped, the prize that Dwight Davis's Longwood Cricket
Club pals playfully called ``Dwight's pot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Age of Cap Mac may or may not begin with victory (it looks
3-2 for the United States to me), but his mere presence made the
local president coo. As Mugabe spoke, a much-needed downpour
suddenly lashed the tent. ``Ah, McEnroe and his Americans have
brought us rain,'' he grinned.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe may be able to hire out as a rainmaker. But it has
always been incidental to his thunder.

INCUBUS BUCKS THE NEGATIVITY IMPERATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; At one time, it was rebellious to be angry. Now, as the band
Incubus has discovered, it's the other way around. In the brave new
world of the ``nu metal'' genre, it's suddenly rebellious to be
positive.
</P>
<P>
   Limp Bizkit. Korn. Rage Against the Machine. There are not a lot
of happy campers in that bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Incubus _ a group of youths who grew up together and
formed in a garage in Calabasas, Calif., in 1991. Its first
full-length disc, ``S.C.I.E.N.C.E.'' (1997), was relatively rude
and crude, but its second and latest, ``Make Yourself,'' is filled
with cries to get your life together and, as one song says, to
``experience the warmth before you grow old.'' The group's new
radio hit, ``Pardon Me,'' starts out angry, but urges listeners to
``rise above the flame.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to create something positive out of this harder genre
we get categorized in,'' says Incubus guitarist Mike Einziger,
whose band is on the Sno-Core tour. ``It is much easier to be angry
and be full of angst and rant about things you hate. You can come
off as stupid if you go the other way . . . It's not easy to make
people say, `Yeah, we like this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Incubus rocks hard, but also stands out from the crowd in its
use of world music instruments such as the electric sitar that
Einziger sometimes plays, or the African djembe (hand drum) and
didgeridoo that singer Brandon Boyd sometimes employs. Those came
from attending Grateful Dead concerts, where Boyd and Einziger
participated in drum circles in the parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really liked the Dead, but I loved going to the shows
and getting wasted and enjoying the party atmosphere,'' says
Einziger, 23, who was more into Phish than the Dead, but also into
Slayer, Iron Maiden, and Metallica for his metal roots. ``I grew up
around a lot of music. My mom was also a jazz singer, so I heard
Billie Holiday, Nina Simone, and people like that. Brandon's mother
is also a jazz singer.''
</P>
<P>
   Incubus, which includes DJ Chris Kilmore (whose turntable
scratching adds a modern, hip-hop dimension to the guitar-based
hard rock), started when the core members were 14 and 15 years old.
They were asked to play at a party and didn't yet have a band name,
so Einziger riffled through a thesaurus to find one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found `incubus,' '' he says. ``I didn't know what it meant,
but it sounded good. And then later, I found out that it referred
to a spirit who seduces women while they're sleeping. That sounded
kind of cool, but really, Incubus is just a name for us. It doesn't
mean anything to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Incubus has some serious messages on its new album, but also has
a strong sense of humor in its approach to the music business. A
recent press release had these words from Boyd: ``When we come
home, we will have sold 10 million copies, will have played 500
live shows, will never want to see each other again, will have
changed the musical tastes and philosophical perspectives of an
entire generation . . . and will have bulging, curvaceous abdomens
from years of truck-stop dining and beer-guzzling escapades.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to let people know that we don't take ourselves too
seriously,'' says Einziger. ``And, really, there's nothing I can
complain about. Things are going well. We just got added to MTV the
other day, which is exciting. Everything is growing at a really
comfortable pace. We don't want to be overnight sensations or
one-hit wonders. We want to be around awhile.''

NORSEMAN CAME SECOND, MOWATT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Over five decades of writing, Farley Mowat has helped
changed the way many North Americans and Europeans think about
wolves, whales, and aboriginal culture.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the internationally acclaimed chronicler of the Far North
and North Atlantic is taking on the Vikings in a challenge to
conventional views of how _ and when _ Europeans first reached the
New World.
</P>
<P>
   Mowat's latest book, ``The Farfarers,'' makes the extraordinary
claim that the Viking voyagers were preceded across the Atlantic by
an ancient race of Britons, whom he calls the Albans, older even
than the Gaels. Setting out from the northernmost Scottish isles,
these anonymous seafarers made their way in walrus-hide boats from
Iceland to Greenland and, finally, Newfoundland _ arriving in the
New World in the late 9th century AD, 100 years or so before Viking
Leif Ericsson made his famous landfall.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, according to what's come to be called ``Farley's
version,'' a theory derided by archeologists, but which has drawn
considerable attention, including a recent cover article in
Canadian Geographic, a well-respected journal.
</P>
<P>
   Mowat, 79, is delighted by the uproar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book is storytelling _ it's meant to be exciting, like all
good history should be,'' he said. ``But it's based on a hell of a
lot of serious research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't so many decades ago that ideas of even the Vikings
as first-comers seemed farfetched _ everyone just `knew' Columbus
discovered North America,'' he added. ``I've never liked concepts
of firsts. People have always drifted around this planet like
smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   The US edition, published by Vermont's Steerforth Press, is just
hitting retail shelves south of the border. The book has been a top
seller in Canada for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   There are any number of wild ideas about the European discovery
of North America, but Mowat does not belong to the ranks of
theorists that see a Druid ruin in every abandoned New England root
cellar or runestone in every scratched rock.
</P>
<P>
   The author of 36 books, mostly nonfiction, that have sold 14
million copies in 52 languages, Mowat is one of Canada's most
highly-regarded writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Farfarers'' is based on archeological observations made
during years of travels in the Arctic, Newfoundland, and Labrador,
together with research based on the Norse sagas and other medieval
writings.
</P>
<P>
   Central to the book is Mowat's belief that curious stone towers
and foundations found in Arctic and Atlantic Canada were built by
the same people responsible for similar ancient structures in the
British Isles.
</P>
<P>
   ``In years of poking around these ruins, I've been nagged by the
notion that they were sign of some earlier presence (than the
Vikings),'' Mowat said. ``But that's an idea that upsets the
archeological applecart. So the reaction has been vehement.''

NEW CLUES EMERGE ON THE VIKINGS' VOYAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   REYKJAVIK, Iceland _ As Scandinavians, Americans, and Canadians
prepare to mark the 1,000th anniversary of the Viking arrival in
the New World with a series of ambitious exhibits and celebrations,
researchers are uncovering new evidence that Viking expeditions
ranged farther into the Arctic than previously believed and that
their contacts with the ``Skraelings'' _ the aboriginal inhabitants
with whom they battled and bartered _ spanned centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The disparate clues _ a strand of yarn found in the frozen
Arctic tundra, rivets from a longship _ provide tantalizing hints
that the Vikings may have journeyed nearly to the North Pole and
southward all the way to the Gulf of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The Viking voyages from Iceland and Greenland across the
treacherous waters of the North Atlantic still fire the
imagination, and inspire fierce controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Smithsonian Institution and other museums prepare
major exhibitions depicting Vikings as the first European
discoverers of North America, a controversy has erupted that echoes
the debate that once surrounded the claims that Vikngs had preceded
Christopher Columbus to the New World by 500 years. Canadian author
Farley Mowat, one of the best-known chroniclers of the far north,
is raising scholarly hackles _ and winning wide attention _ with
speculations that the Vikings themselves were late-comers, beaten
across the Atlantic by centuries by a little-known race of seagoers
from the British Isles.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Farfarers,'' a Canadian bestseller just published in
the United States, Mowat claims that mysterious stone towers and
building foundations found from the Arctic barrens south to
Newfoundland were not built by Eskimos or Vikings, but are similar
to ancient structures found in Scotland's Orkney, Shetland, and
Western islands.
</P>
<P>
   The book argues that these forgotten mariners, hopping island to
island in walrus-skin boats, ventured first to Greenland and
Iceland before settling in the sheltered coves of northeastern
Canada. They got there, he contends, about 200 years before Leif
Ericsson _ the most famous of Viking explorers _ founded a
short-lived trading colony in 1000 AD near present-day L'Anse aux
Meadows, Newfoundland.
</P>
<P>
   Arctic scientists, historians of the Viking era, and, above all,
proud Icelanders for whom ``Leif the Discoverer'' remains a
national hero, are incensed that Mowat's theories are attracting so
much attention. They say there is no hard archeological proof to
back his colorful claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many absurd tales are told,'' said Einar Benediktsson,
director of Iceland's Leifur Eiriksson Millennium Commission. ``But
serious scholars go by the archeological evidence, and all the
discoveries point to the Vikings as the first Europeans to reach
North America.''
</P>
<P>
   Such discoveries are still being made _ some large, some small,
but all adding incrementally to knowledge of the intrepid seafarers
who presided over one of the world's greatest trading empires, but
who are remembered mostly as bloodthirsty invaders who pillaged
England, looted the monasteries of Ireland, sacked Paris, and
caused generations of Europeans to end their prayers with the
appeal, ``From the fury of the North Men, deliver us, oh Lord!''
</P>
<P>
   To the west, they settled Iceland and Greenland and made bold
forays to places they called Helluland, Markland, and Vinland. Even
today, little is known of these ventures to a new continent, but
researchers are combing sites in the High Arctic and the rugged
shores of Newfoundland for fresh clues.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a new bit of North American history was unraveled
with the revelation that a strand of yarn found at an archeological
site high in the Canadian Arctic is Norse in origin. In itself,
there's nothing momentous about yarn _ even a piece 800 years old,
according to radiocarbon dating. But this fragment, uncovered near
the Inuit, or Eskimo, settlement of Pond Inlet on Baffin Island and
probably spun in a Norse village in Greenland, is significant since
it adds to evidence that Vikings were still journeying to the New
World in the 13th Century _ 300 years after quitting their first
settlement in Newfoundland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It points to a much longer Norse presence in North America,
not just a few quick sailing trips,'' said Patricia Sutherland,
archeologist and associate curator of the Canadian Museum of
Civilization in Hull, Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery was made at a site once occupied by the Dorset
people, an early aboriginal culture of North America that
disappeared around 1500 AD _ probably wiped out by aggressive Thule
Eskimos, ancestors of today's Inuit, not by the Vikings. (The
Norsemen were the only Europeans to be ultimately defeated and sent
scampering by natives.)
</P>
<P>
   The find suggests extensive commerce between Dorsets and
Vikings. ``We're beginning to see that the relationship between
aboriginal people and the Norse was sustained over centuries,''
Sutherland said.
</P>
<P>
   That relationship is central to an exhibit scheduled to open in
June at the Provincial Museum of Newfoundland: ``Full Circle: First
Contact, Vikings and Skraelings in Newfoundland and Labrador.''
</P>
<P>
   Humanity originated in Africa, then _ over hundreds of thousands
of years _ migrated to the Middle East, where, to put it in
simplistic terms, one group turned west to Europe and the other
east to Asia and eventually North America by way of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humans completed their circuit of the globe when aboriginal
people and Norse encountered each other on the Strait of Belle Isle
between Newfoundland and Labrador,'' said Kevin McAleese, curator
of the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   The Viking voyages are told in the Icelandic sagas, the old
written retellings _ partly myth, but largely historic _ of the
extraordinary Norse expansion across the Atlantic. But proof of the
sort that scientists need was not discovered until 1961, when
Norwegian researcher Helge Ingstad and his archeologist wife, Anne
Stine, uncovered the ancient sod houses at L'Anse aux Meadows, at
the tip of Newfoundland's Great Northern Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more of an over-wintering camp and base for exploration
than a permanent colony,'' said Birgitta Wallace, a Canadian
government archeologist who conducted more extensive excavations in
the 1970s. ``It may have been used only for a few years, and even
then not continuously.''
</P>
<P>
   L'Anse aux Meadows remains the only known Viking outpost on the
continent. But more recent finds show that the Norse ranged far and
wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``An astonishing number of artifacts have been found in the High
Arctic,'' said Peter Schledermann, senior research associate for
the Arctic Institute of North America at Alberta's University of
Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   Most dramatic of these finds, perhaps, was Schledermann's
recovery of pieces of Viking chain armor and fragments of a Norse
ship from the vicinity of an aboriginal settlement on the eastern
edge of Canada's Ellesmere Island, less than 800 miles from the
North Pole. Dated to about 1250 A.D., these fragments, too, show
Norse forays to the New World continued for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   To the south, Scandinavian researchers continue to scour
Newfoundland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence for more clues to
mysterious Vinland, the name given to the fairest of the lands
found by the Vikings, after wild grapes they harvested.
</P>
<P>
   No one yet knows the true location of Vinland. Swedish
archeologist Mats Larsson has just published a controversial study,
based on a study of maps, claiming that Vinland refers to the
southern tip of Nova Scotia, on the Gulf of Maine. Birgitta Wallace
favors the theory that Vinland refers to the temperate Gulf of St.
Lawrence region.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jonas Kristjansson, one of Iceland's foremost
scholars of the sagas, is preparing a small expedition this summer
to seek out other possible Viking sites in the region of
Newfoundland's Notre Dame Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many theories, some spun from little more than
sea mist,'' Kristjansson said. ``A thousand years since Leif
Ericsson set sail, and yet Vinland still obsesses people of the
north.''

THIS THOUGHTFUL MAN NEEDS TO BE IN ALL OF OUR THOUGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He was the first player ever drafted by the Patriots. A
running back from Springfield, Ohio, and Northwestern University,
Ron Burton came to Greater Boston and never left.
</P>
<P>
   Burton played six seasons with the Boston Patriots, back when
games were in Fenway Park against Jack Kemp and the Buffalo Bills.
He rushed for more than 1,500 yards and scored 19 touchdowns with
the original Patriots. He was strong and fast.
</P>
<P>
   And now he cracks a rib if he sneezes too hard.
</P>
<P>
   Burton went to work for John Hancock after retiring from
football and he and JoAnn Burton raised five great kids in their
humble home in Framingham.
</P>
<P>
   He carved out a career making motivational speeches, but he
always wanted to give something more, so in 1985 he borrowed
against his retirement and some real estate and bought land in
Hubbardston. That was the beginning of the Ron Burton Training
Village, where Boston kids go during the summer to chisle their
minds, bodies, and spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Burton fights his own battle of mind, body, and spirit.
At the age of 63, he is being treated at Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute for multiple myeloma (cancer of the lymphatic system _
the cells that make antibodies). The first doctors told him he has
one to three years to live. Burton has other thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already won,'' he said earlier this week from his John
Hancock office. ``I have a lot of faith. I'm leaving it in the
Lord's hands. He has allowed me to reach out and help other people.
I'm so thankful. That brings so much joy to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In tragedy he has found triumph. He's inspired a network of
doctors, business leaders, family members, neighbors, and
inner-city youths who have concluded that it's too soon for Ron to
say goodbye. They're providing the medicines and prayers he needs
to beat cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Ron Burton serves to remind us that not every
professional athlete is a selfish, greedy, thoughtless criminal.
Some Boston pro sports players are truly good guys who spend huge
parts of their lives giving back. Burton is one of the good guys.
Almost too good to be true. And that is why hundreds of people are
praying for his recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got an inner strength, discipline, and determination,''
said Burton's doctor, Ken Anderson, the medical director of the
Kraft Family Blood Donor Center. ``And that's going to be his
approach to this newest challenge. He's soft-spoken and humble.
Even now, he's not putting himself first. He remains concerned for
others and inspirational for others.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton's Training Village was inspired by his own youth. People
helped him when he was a kid and he made up his mind that he would
return the favor if ever he had the chance. The camp has been going
strong since 1985. Worthy campers are recommended by churches,
school administrators, Boys and Girls Clubs, and Big Brother-Sister
organizations. It's a six-week course in physical and mental
development with all the food you can eat.
</P>
<P>
   One would hardly call it a vacation. Campers awake at 4:30 a.m.
and run 7 1/2 miles a day. Burton runs with them. That's what he
did when he was a kid. That's what got him into professional
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom died when I was 12,'' he recalled. ``My dad got sick
and had to leave. All I had was my grandmother, who was a gospel
preacher. I remember being hungry. That taught me early life is not
a joke. Kids would make fun of me when I was poor. Ever since then
I saved everything I had and invested it. That's what you do when
you don't have anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to help other people. I first got the idea for
the camp during the Boston busing crisis in the 1970s. I would go
to speak at schools and they'd have police in the corridors. I knew
I had to reach out and do something extra.''
</P>
<P>
   And he did. And hundreds of kids have benefited.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Ron and his son Steve (a sports reporter for WBZ-TV)
were walking on slick pavement wearing dress shoes. Both slipped
and fell. Ron landed on his tailbone. It hurt, but his son Phil was
getting married the next day, so he put ice on it and kept moving.
Three months later it still hurt, so he went to Mass. General.
Burton was told that he'd crushed some vertebra. Fifty percent of
his blood was missing. More tests yielded the grim diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked them to give it to me straight,'' he said. ``They said
70 percent of my bones were infected and they would give me one to
three years and there's no cure. I went back to the garage and all
I did was cry. Then I thought, `Wait a minute, I have all these
Christmas parties. These kids rely on me for all these gifts. I
can't tell anybody 'til after Christmas.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So he went to the parties and brought the gifts . . . for camp
kids, Mass. adoption kids, Nativity Prep kids, Sister Jean's kids
in Jamaica Plain . . . and finally, the grown-up Burton kids.
</P>
<P>
   After celebrating Christmas he called his children together.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want to spoil the holiday so he waited,'' recalled
oldest son Steve. ``Then he told us and he said, `I'm glad it's me
and not any one of you guys. I've lived a great life.' I had to
leave the room.''
</P>
<P>
   Patriots owner Bob Kraft got the word the day of the last New
England game (Jan. 2) and sent Burton over to Dana-Farber. The
Patriots' owner was one of several Boston business leaders who
swung into action when news broke of Burton's condition. Jack
Connors, Don Rodman, Jack Shaughnessy, and Dave D'Alessandro are
other leaders of Team Burton.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys have gone to work for me like you wouldn't
believe,'' said Burton. ``It's so wonderful what they're doing.
They made me cry. Jack Connors brought everyone together and said,
`Save Ron Burton.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Burton's treatment includes radiation plus a cycle of
chemotherapy _ four days on, three weeks off. He says the days
after chemo remind him of Monday mornings after game days four
decades ago. Unable to spring out of bed, he goes to his knees and
uses the wall to prop himself up on his feet. Then he tries to
move. His sons help him stretch. His weight went from 190 to 165,
but he's gained some back. The hair is next to go.
</P>
<P>
   He claims never to have had a smoke, alcoholic beverage, or
illegal drug and he won't use painkillers, saying, ``I want to know
where I'm at.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect to hear any complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just so thankful,'' said Burton. ``I've got so many
friends, everybody praying for me. There's so many people rooting
for me. I'm so thankful for all the blessings and because I've been
able to serve. One of the greatest feelings there is is to help
other people.''
</P>
<P>
   He's been helping people in Greater Boston for 40 years, doing
what he loves, giving back. Now it's our turn to return some love
to Ron Burton.

MURPHY ENDS UP PAYING HIGH PRICE FOR FREE SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ All that is left now is for Mike O'Connell and Joe
Murphy's agent to arm wrestle over the definition of
insubordination, but the right wing has played his last shift in a
Bruins sweater for fracturing the fine print of the First Amendment
Tuesday night in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   For those unfamiliar with that fine print, it reads something
like this: You're free to say what you want to the coach, but if
you're going to be that dumb, make certain no one else can hear it.
</P>
<P>
   By numerous accounts, Murphy chose the wrong time and place to
test his freedom of speech, launching into a verbal tirade directed
toward Pat Burns during the first period at Ottawa. The exchange
resumed after the first period, prompting Burns, veteran coach and
onetime patrolman, to tell the 32-year-old Murphy to close his
mouth and turn in his sweater.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell met Murphy Thursday and handed him a letter that
essentially detailed his termination as an employee of the Boston
Professional Hockey Association, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy's reaction?
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands,'' said O'Connell, adding the club will not pay
Murphy his remaining salary, some $350,000, due to breach of
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy's agent, Jay Fee, when informed that O'Connell said his
client ``understands,'' said, ``Well, he understands what they're
trying to do to him.'' Murphy wasn't available for comment,
according to Fee.
</P>
<P>
   Fee wouldn't provide chapter and verse of Murphy's version of
the story, only saying he felt ``an emotional exchange of words''
did not constitute insubordination. Fee was in contact Thursday
with the NHL Players Association, a sign that a grievance possibly
will be filed with the union and Murphy's pay issue ultimately
settled by an arbiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe that the situation as described by Boston is
accurate,'' said Fee. ``And we don't believe it will be successful.
Further, we don't believe the punishment fits the crime.''
</P>
<P>
   These are wild and wacky days on Fleet Street. Last week, team
owner Jeremy Jacobs told the Globe's Will McDonough he was
displeased with the way the club was being coached. He couldn't
fathom how a team that led the league in penalty killing last
season could be dead last this season.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, an exasperated O'Connell, miffed by his team's lack
of skating, flatly stated, ``We are not a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Murph has been turfed.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the way championships are won?
</P>
<P>
   We've seen severe benchings here in the Hub. Who could forget
Steve Kasper letting Cam Neely and Kevin Stevens stew for a whole
game? Let's not forget the night in Quebec City when Rick Bowness
asked Messrs. Craig Janney and Bob Sweeney to pull off their
sweaters after 20 minutes of indifferent play. None of them
grinned, but they all bore it. None of them were summarily handed a
pink slip. They lived to play at least another day or two in Black
'n' Gold.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy's abrupt departure is a significant sign of support for
Burns, who can use some propping up, whether he's asked back next
year or not. Imagine if he had informed O'Connell and Boston boss
Harry Sinden about Murphy's remarks and the response was, ``Well,
gee, Pat, you are the coach _ deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   No coach could stand back there, with one of his players
mouthing off, berating him with expletives, and expect to maintain
any semblance of team discipline and work ethic. When Murphy began
a-cussin' and a-stewin', he not only forced Burns to call him out,
he also forced management to throw him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like it,'' said Kyle McLaren, referring to some of
Murphy's remarks, which he said he received secondhand from other
teammates. ``You can't condone it. No one in the league can
disrespect the coach, no matter who it is _ Pat Burns, Pat Quinn,
whoever. You have to respect your peers and your coaches. That's
what I didn't like. It's almost like disrespecting Ray (Bourque).
Both guys have accomplished so much. You just don't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fee could be right, and technically Murphy didn't commit an act
of insubordination. But based on enough earwitnesses to fill, oh, a
team bus, he broke a common sense standard that left Burns &AMP; Co.
little choice but to show him the gate.
</P>
<P>
   It had to be difficult, even somewhat embarrassing, for
O'Connell to make the move. He and Murphy were teammates in Detroit
in the mid-'80s. O'Connell was instrumental in bringing him here
when it became clear Burns didn't think a number of Providence
Bruins were quite ready for prime time NHL minutes. For a prorated
$1 million, O'Connell stole Murphy away from the Rangers, for whom
he was trying out at the time, and brought him here to help spark a
sputtering offense. Such a steal.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy put up only seven goals and 14 points in 26 games, hardly
numbers to boast of. When he first came here, he was the club's
fastest skater (the good news and the bad news), but that jump
wasn't there of late. His most memorable moment was a frightful
display in St. Louis Dec. 18, when he rushed off the bench and
savagely ambushed the Blues' Tyson Nash after the St. Louis pest
barreled into captain Ray Bourque. Burns said he appreciated the
team spirit behind the assault, but he also couldn't support what
Murphy did because the resultant penalty put the game out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's all out of reach for Murphy. There isn't a single coach
in the Original 28 who will willingly take on a guy who has been
charged with cussin' out the coach on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Free speech. It's there for everyone. With one warning: The
hidden charges can be murder.

MCCAIN POLL   NUMBERS HAVE BUSH STUMPING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUMTER, S.C. _ With two new polls showing that Senator John
McCain has pulled even in the presidential primary here, the
campaign of George W. Bush has sharpened its attack, allowing the
campaign to move into an area long dominated by McCain: military
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Military matters were brought up when Bush, holding a rally with
veterans who support him, was introduced by a Vietnam veteran who
accused McCain of ignoring the concerns of veterans.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush and his surrogates already seeking to cast McCain as a
liberal, some of Bush's GOP supporters expressed fears that the
move might well backfire. McCain's campaign, on the other hand,
welcomed the assault as evidence that the Texas governor's campaign
is in disarray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they keep doing it,'' former senator Warren B. Rudman,
one of McCain's closest advisers, said of the attacks. ``It's
evidence that they've panicked. . .. George Bush cannot say John
McCain is a liberal and is soft on issues related to Vietnam and
get away with it; you can't do that to a guy who spent 5 1/2 years
in a North Vietnamese prison camp.''
</P>
<P>
   At rally Thursday, J. Thomas Burch, chairman of the National
Vietnam and Gulf War Coalition, accused McCain of abandoning
veterans on issues ranging from health care to normalization of
relations with Vietnam. Burch, a Washington lawyer who flew to
South Carolina for the event, told the crowd, ``He always opposed
all the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He voted in the Senate. He had the power to help veterans,''
said Burch, 57, who served in Vietnam for a year and a half. ``He
came home and he forgot us.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to McCain were delighted Bush surrogates raised the issue,
which they have long considered to be one of McCain's strongest
selling points.
</P>
<P>
   Even some aides to Bush interpreted it as a sign of panic. The
attack on McCain came after new polls showed the Arizona
Republican, who had trailed by more than 20 points in South
Carolina polls before the New Hampshire primary, drawing into a
statistical tie with Bush. It also underscored a sense, expressed
privately by some of Bush's most influential advisers, that his
campaign lacks a compelling message and strategy in the wake of his
lopsided defeat in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Zogby poll taken this week, McCain led Bush 44
percent to 39 percent, with a 4.4-point margin of error. A poll by
Rasmussen Research on the same day showed Bush ahead 41 percent to
40 percent, with a 4-point margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's event, Bush did not criticize McCain's voting
record on military matters. Responding to McCain television ads
that suggest Bush's tax cuts would put Social Security at risk,
Bush said, ``Any ad made by John McCain that infers, implies, or
says that I won't reserve money for Social Security is
Washington-style politics.'' He also called McCain a ``Washington
insider'' who ran ``from the left'' in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he stood by the opinions of the veterans who
endorsed him minutes earlier, Bush said simply, ``You need to talk
to them about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I stand by is the fact they took a look at both of us,
and they chose me to be the nominee,'' Bush said. ``These men have
their opinion and they have stated their opinion. John McCain
served our country well, he was a warrior on behalf of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Burch, who had been invited to speak at the event, said he
believed Bush shared his views. And former Governor David Beasley,
who regularly speaks on behalf of the Bush campaign, said that
``while John McCain is a war hero, his legislative record is not
exemplary.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics and even some Bush supporters were calling into
question this line of attack.
</P>
<P>
   One former national party official and Bush supporter, ticking
off a string of strategic miscues, said he had warned campaign
officials that Bush runs a grave risk of being seen as desperate if
he resorts to using negative attacks to cast McCain as a liberal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too late for that to work. And it's not believable,''
said the former official, who spoke on condition of anonymity
``There are some things John McCain is vulnerable on. But calling
him a liberal and attacking him on defense issues is like saying
Ronald Reagan was soft on communism. People simply will not believe
it.''
</P>
<P>
   That strategist, as well as other Bush advisers, said the
campaign lacks a coherent message, at the very moment when some
Republican voters are beginning to have doubts that Bush has the
depth needed to become president.
</P>
<P>
   A former top aide to George Bush, the former president, said the
campaign is now riven with dissension, with its Austin ``praetorian
guard,'' as he called it, feuding with state coordinators over who
is to blame for the debacle in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns among Bush's principal supporters about the campaign's
direction even led to a meeting this week between Michigan Governor
John Engler, one of Bush's principal supporters, whose state
primary is just three days after the Feb. 19 South Carolina vote,
and Senator Judd Gregg, who ran Bush's campaign in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   According to a former party official who knows both men, the
meeting was called to discuss how Bush's state coordinators could
seize greater control over the campaign's scheduling and message.
</P>
<P>
   The attack by Burch echoes earlier criticisms of McCain, who was
assailed by veterans groups when he supported normalized diplomatic
relations with Vietnam. But his POW record and his often-hawkish
views on military issues have protected him from all but his most
vehement critics _ a fact that explains why Bush's comments are a
political risk.
</P>
<P>
   McCain himself professed amazement at Burch's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every veterans organization in America has given me their
highest award,'' he said. ``Now, here's the question: Have I fooled
all of these veterans organizations that have given me their
absolute highest awards and honors, or is there maybe a little bit
of foolishness going on here?''
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush may have criticized McCain's tax-cut proposals, the
senator's record and policies on the military have gone
unchallenged, and his aides say they believe they are unassailable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad (Bush) wants to talk about veterans' issues, which
I thought would be a demilitarized zone,'' said McCain's political
director, John Weaver. ``This is the kind of politics you practice
when you're running for president of the Young Republicans: `Try
something, anything.' It's kind of off-message.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign distributed a long list of McCain's achievements on
the issues for which he was criticized. They included his
co-sponsorship of the Agent Orange Act of 1991, to provide
disability benefits to veterans with cancer brought on after
exposure; his formation of the Arizona Gulf War Syndrome Support
Group; and his sponsorship of a 1997 law authorizing free medical
and dental care for Reservists and National Guardsmen with Gulf War
Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   At least one veteran thought the criticisms irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you comparing a guy who served his country and went into
combat, compared to a guy who ran and hid in a reserve unit in
Texas?'' said Stephen Fletcher, a submarine veteran and McCain
supporter who attended the senator's speech at the Charleston
Maritime Center.``There's no doubt in my mind who these guys are
gonna vote for.''

A DISAGREEMENT FOR DERSHOWITZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz disagrees with
Major League Baseball's decision to suspend John Rocker for his
tasteless comments on life in the inner city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will baseball now need a platoon of speech cops monitoring
players in bars and barbecues?'' Dershowitz asked in an op-ed piece
in Tuesday's New York Times. ``Or will the new rule be limited to
published comments? What about taunts on the field? Now that
baseball has drawn a line in the sand, it must apply uniformly.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Commissioner) Bud Selig would have been wiser not to suspend
Rocker, but to announce that the league was committed to freedom of
speech and that the comments of individual players should not be
misunderstood as reflecting the opinions of Major League
Baseball,'' Dershowitz concluded.
</P>
<P>
   But Dershowitz explained that Selig was ``well'' within his
legal rights to suspend the Atlanta Braves pitcher, that the First
Amendment precludes only governmental bodies from imposing speech
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, Mr. Dershowitz.

   Gary McCord is unafraid to share his thoughts on the world of
golf. McCord teams up with Jim Nantz, Ken Venturi, David Feherty,
Peter Kostis, Peter Oosterhuis, and Bobby Clampett to cover the
AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am on CBS. Third-round coverage
begins at 3 p.m. Saturday and the final round airs 3 p.m. to
conclusion Sunday.

<P>
   Tiger Woods is trying to win his sixth straight tournament, and
McCord doesn't think it's going to happen. ``Tiger's streak has
gone beyond lucky,'' McCord told reporters. ``This is not an
aberration. We are watching a man do his job very well in an
environment that is full of guys that carry the same amount of
clubs and are capable of beating him. The point is they haven't in
a while.''
</P>
<P>
   McCord further said that Woods would not beat Byron Nelson's
streak of 11 straight victories. ``Immortality does not exist in
the cosmos,'' McCord said. ``You couldn't win that many tournaments
today with only one other guy in the field. One of these days, the
putts aren't going to fall or mentally he won't be able to get
adjusted for whatever reason. Maybe he won't like the color of his
courtesy car. He's at five and counting, trying to catch Ben
Hogan's six in a row. Ben is out of reach. If I sound like I'm
walking that thin shaft of a 1-iron, I am. I keep thinking, `No one
is that good in this day and age.' But he is certainly making a
point.''

UNC SET BACK ON ITS HEELS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Want a dark-horse team for the NCAA tournament? Try North
Carolina. Don't laugh. The once-mighty Tar Heels, a perennial sure
shot to win 20 games a year, have dropped to the level of ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   The latest insult came last week when they dropped out of the
Associated Press Top 25 after a run of 172 consecutive weeks, the
second-longest streak (to UCLA's) in NCAA history.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Thursday's game against Duke, the Tar Heels had lost
eight of 21 games, their worst opening stretch since the 1964-65
season.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, coach Bill Guthridge is taking most of the heat. The
radio talk shows and Internet chat sessions are full of ``Guthridge
has lost it'' talk and calls for him to go.
</P>
<P>
   That won't happen. At least not voluntarily. Guthridge is Dean
Smith's man, and as long as Smith is around, decisions on
Guthridge's career will be made by Guthridge (with consultation
with Smith, no doubt).
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't any one thing,'' said Guthridge. ``Losing is
contagious. We need to feel like we can win again.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent home loss indicates how far the Heels have fallen.
Florida State, a .500 team, came to the Dean Dome in Chapel Hill
and treated it like just another place.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to write off the season. Things can change
quickly, and Carolina has the talent to win enough games to get
into the NCAA tournament and do well.
</P>
<P>
   The game against Duke was indicative of what the Heels can and
cannot do.
</P>
<P>
   The simple fact is that Carolina is an ordinary team on most
nights. Considering the tradition of the place, that should change
quickly, but you never know.
</P>

   Things are tough enough for Boston University coach Dennis
Wolff, whose team is off to a horrible start, but a series of
incidents has the Terriers struggling just to field a team each
night.
</P>
<P>
   BU started out with 13 players on scholarship, but two players
are sitting out the season, two are hurt, and two have left because
of academic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff scoured the campus for walk-ons and came up with one.
However, with a road trip two weeks ago to Hartford and Vermont,
the coach felt eight players were not sufficient, so he went
looking for another.
</P>
<P>
   He thought he had one, but that didn't work out when the player
made it clear his first priority was preparing for medical school
entrance exams at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff's next search led to the resume of his sophomore manager,
Tim Kelly, who had some playing experience in high school.
</P>
<P>
   After checking with the school compliance people to make sure
all rules were being followed, Wolff added Kelly to the roster as
an emergency player.
</P>
<P>
   And the first emergency occurred Sunday during a double-overtime
loss at Vermont, when two players fouled out and another was hurt,
leaving the Terriers with five players plus Kelly for the final
minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, another player fouled out in the final seconds of
the first overtime and Kelly was sent into the game. Wolff's
message to Kelly, who ended up playing four minutes: ``Don't take
this the wrong way, but if someone throws you the ball, throw it
right back to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolff feels his team is playing as hard as it can but is also
playing against all odds. He has seen his team lose four of its
last six games by a total of 7 points. During that stretch, only
one opponent, first-place Hofstra, rolled to a relatively easy
victory.
</P>
<P>

   Word has it that Georgia Tech will have to win the Atlantic
Coast Conference tournament for Bobby Cremins to save his job.
Cremins and athletic director Dave Brane are not on the same page,
and Cremins is telling friends that he is basically gone at the end
of the year, barring some last-minute miracle. He does have a
four-year rollover contract and it will cost the school some money
to dump him.
</P>
<P>
   Now here's where the story gets even better. The top man on
Brane's short list? Former Massachusetts coach John Calipari, who
has said he wants to return to college coaching and has already had
preliminary talks about a job at Memphis. But Georgia Tech would
trump that for Calipari, who is finishing out this season as an
assistant to Larry Brown with the Philadelphia 76ers. Calipari
reportedly is looking at high school recruiting lists to see who
might be available if and when he makes his move back into college.

   St. John's coach Mike Jarvis and some of his players don't
consider playing at Madison Square Garden a home-court advantage,
feeling that the crowd has become neutral over the last few years
and that when a team with a big following, such as Connecticut,
comes to town, there are as many people cheering against the Red
Storm as for them. Jarvis says tiny Alumni Hall is his team's home
court. Fine. Let St. John's play all of its games in Alumni Hall,
let it take the hit financially, and let's see how many recruits
Jarvis gets when prospects see that band box of a gym, with no
Madison Square Garden as a recruiting tool. St. John's played _ and
lost to Ohio State _ at the Garden last week and the crowd was
definitely loud and pro-St. John's. Still, Jarvis is so paranoid
about the crowd that he tried to limit the number of tickets
available to UConn fans for the Feb. 21 game. Good teams, as Ohio
State proved, can win anywhere and make it their home court. The
Red Storm have only to look in the mirror to explain their losses
to Ohio State, Notre Dame, and Syracuse, in which they were
outscored, 11-0, 16-2, and 14-3 in the final minutes . . . Say what
you want about the Big East, but the conference had the only
unbeaten men's team (Syracuse) and women's team (UConn) in Division
1 basketball before the Huskies' 1-point loss to Tennessee on
Wednesday . . . The Atlantic 10 has become the Argentine connection
this season, with three players from Argentina _ Temple's Pepe
Sanchez, Fordham's Alejandro Olivares, and St. Bonaventure's
Patricio Prato . . . Things are getting ugly at South Carolina. A
winless football season was tough enough, but things haven't been
much better in basketball with the Gamecocks sitting on the bottom
of the SEC East. A home loss to Vanderbilt last week drew boos and
the throwing of debris, some of which was aimed at Vanderbilt and
some directed toward embattled coach Eddie Fogler and his players.
Consider Fogler on the endangered coaches list.

WILL THE MONEY SPOIL THE MESSAGE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How hard is it to flush out campaign contributions when you bash
the system that allows them to flourish? It's not as hard as you
might think _ as long as people see you as a winner.
</P>
<P>
   The more difficult issue for Arizona Senator John McCain may be
this: How much money can you take and from whom and still claim to
be a proponent of campaign finance reform?
</P>
<P>
   In all of 1999, McCain raised less than $14 million. After he
beat Texas Governor George W. Bush in New Hampshire, McCain, the
candidate for campaign reform, raised more than $741,000 million
over the Internet. His traditional fund-raising apparatus is
kicking in as well. Like all campaigns, the heart of McCain's
fund-raising effort beats around a small group of influential
business people who believe in the candidate, heart, soul, and
wallet.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, for example, the group includes Marshall Carter,
chairman and chief executive officer for State Street Bank who is
also on McCain's national finance committee. He co-hosted two
fund-raisers for McCain, one last month, with Hale and Dorr lawyer
Ernest Klein, and one in September, with Fidelity executive David
Weinstein, that raised $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Carter mailed out 627 fund-raising letters around the
country on McCain's behalf. The missive, seeking contributions of
$1,000, praises the candidate as a patriot and hero, a ``solid
pro-business Republican and as ``a president who can make us
proud.'' The letter mentions McCain's support for campaign finance
reform but doesn't dwell on it.
</P>
<P>
   Like McCain, Carter hails from a military family and the two
served in Vietnam. Their shared background is an obvious
connection, but Carter says his reasons for supporting McCain go
beyond that. The most important: McCain's character and leadership
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, character and campaign finance reform are strong themes
in McCain's quest. But it's a lot harder to sell campaign finance
reform to the kind of people national campaigns need most _
business people with lots of money to contribute. When McCain talks
about money's corrosive influence on politics, the little people
cheer. What about people with big bucks and big agendas to go with
them?
</P>
<P>
   Can he continue to talk about it and still raise money? And if
he does, can he keep the reformer message that made him a winner in
New Hampshire? Carter believes he can. He says he agrees with
McCain's goal ``of limiting all candidates to limits which force
them to appeal to broader constituencies.'' As a McCain supporter,
he says he wants only one thing: ``I am looking for this country to
be lead by people we can be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   But the forces opposing McCain will push hard to paint him as an
equivocator, a hypocrite and worse. An article in Thursday's Wall
Street Journal detailed the senator's extensive record of deciding
how the federal government should or shouldn't regulate business
and whose interests he represented in each decision.
</P>
<P>
   More is sure to come, including a repackaging of the so-called
Keating Five scandal and any and all access McCain has provided to
financial services, telecommunications interests and anyone else
who has come before the Senate Commerce Committee, which he chairs.
</P>
<P>
   So far McCain's reply has been an acknowledgement that to some
degree he too is tarnished by the system he wants to change. But at
some point, he will have to tell us plainly where and when he drew
the line between money, access and influence.
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, the smart Republican money has been with Bush. He
raised nearly $70 million last year and started 2000 with $31
million in the bank. Bay State businessman Joe O'Donnell, a
Massachusetts finance cochair for the Bush campaign contends that,
post-New Hampshire, ``a small amount of fickle money'' might go to
McCain. But, he says ``the smart money stays with George W. _ it's
Bush versus Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the McCain campaign doesn't care if the money is
smart, stupid, fickle or just scared the senator might beat the
huge odds against him and win _ as long as it comes in.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate has no choice. He needs money to keep his campaign
alive. For those who like him mostly because of his campaign reform
message: Can it stay alive with the candidate?

OUTSIDERS MAKE HAY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   To the shake-up-the-system voter, investing in Bill Bradley is
like buying bonds; there's not much upside, but not much downside
either, a low-risk bet that probably won't go anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But investing in John McCain's crusade? That's like buying into
one of those Internet IPOs, a rocket-ride on the NASDAQ that could
go up 70 points, but could also crash and burn.
</P>
<P>
   Both got over New Hampshire's daunting first hurdle. McCain's
sensational 19-percent butt-kicking of Texas Governor George W.
Bush triggered a half-million-dollar splurge in contributions on
McCain's Web site next day. Bradley's coming close _ four points _
in New Hampshire dooms Gore to a bitter month of hand-to-hand
combat. The Democrats' contest went really sour in the last week,
when Bradley, facing a downward polling spiral of 12 points in some
surveys, got rough.
</P>
<P>
   By calling Gore a liar and a corrupt devotee of crooked
fund-raising who does not tell the truth and cannot be elected in
the fall, Bradley took the fatal plunge. In doing so he cast his
cause as one of virtue versus vice, and energized his followers who
had been bewildered by the laconic Bradley's passivity in debate
and clueless 2-1 whipping in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   But going postal over Gore's alleged corruption and lying has
poisoned the well of Democratic primary politics. Escalating his
personal feud with Gore means Bradley is also endangering the
Democrats' chances of not only holding the White House, but taking
control of the other House, where a gain of six seats ends
Republican control. Democratic office-holders fear they'll be on a
ticket topped by Gore, who will be bloodied by Bradley. A top Bush
adviser said: ``Bradley's one of those guys thinking he's out there
playing all by himself, where there are no rules. He has no real
ties anymore to the Democratic establishment. That's why it'll be
hard for them to reel him back in.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is Paul Tsongas with a hook shot, bright, quirky, aloof.
He's also known in party circles as a one-way street. Better on TV
than in crowds, he has to guard against appearing intellectually
superior, and overcome doubts about heart arrhythmia and leadership
claims. What did he ever do in the Senate? Ted Kennedy hammered a
ton of ideas into law. Where was Bradley? Gore will fare better
among labor and black voters in the industrial states. But Bradley
appeals to upscale types, and young voters turned off by Gore's
plodding style or ties to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Contesting McCain for the outsider vote, Bradley's style is more
cerebral and less passionate than McCain's approach. Bush must wait
for the McCain phenonenom to run its course. The GOP contest never
descended into the level of invective that clouded the Democrats'
climax. Bush and McCain treat each other with carefully calibrated
civility. ``John's my buddy,'' chirps Bush, a wise move New
Hampshire, where McCain was wildly popular.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does McCain denigrate Bush anything like Bradley does to
Gore, whose barbs at Bradley were less personal and more
policy-oriented. Bush's concession speech was all you could ask
for: graceful, gentlemanly, and free of any personal rancor. Bush
lost well; that should stand him in good stead down the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor has a daunting advantage still. He raised
more money coming into January than McCain, Gore, and Bradley
combined. The GOP establishment is shaken, but not yet panicky. If
Bush comes back in the South and West, the nomination is his, even
though the inevitability rationale lies dead in a snow-covered New
Hampshire ditch.
</P>
<P>
   The trashing of McCain will undoubtedly come from surrogates,
not from Bush's own often-pursed lips. McCain's crusade, a
Braveheart routine of the first order, is anathema to the shadowy
forces of lobbyists, consultants, and corporate string-pullers
whose lavish warchests finance the GOP's control of both House and
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   These penthouse-dwellers atop the pyramid of special interests
risk losing their leverage if McCain's clean-out-the-stable mission
succeeds. While the GOP does not have the same super-delegate
system, which gives Gore a head start of almost 25 percent of the
2,100-plus convention delebates needed, Bush is backed by most GOP
governors, senators, and congressmen, as well as the mob that has
invested $70-plus million in him to date.
</P>
<P>
   So while the overwhelming favorites are still Gore and Bush,
each party faces a bruising internecine battle before the fall
run-off. Democratic high-ups scheme how best to crowbar Bradley out
of the race, but despair for the present. He has money enough to
contest the March 7 round of 14 Democratic contests. Nor will
McCain go quietly.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP establishment plots how to derail him without making a
martyr of him. You've got to be careful how you trash a popular war
hero and ex-POW, when the people love his cause, his solemn vow to
purge the sludge from D.C.'s cement-mixer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrong-way McCain,'' screams an opening salvo on the cover of
National Review, the bible of the conservative bunker-dwellers.
This swipe at McCain's conservative credentials and qualifications
is merely a range-finding salvo. My guess is that the real villains
of the ambush that is coming for McCain will be the shadowy
special-interest groups that fear his pledge to abolish soft money
will strip them of their favorite weapon _ last-minute attack ads
that savage opponents of gun control or advocates of choice on
abortion. The lobbyists for guns and abortion bans have already
targeted McCain, and the Big Tobacco boys will not be far behind.

SHOOTING PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A silhouette. A shadow. A faceless, foreboding, lurching,
menacing darkness. In their terrible moment of fight or flight,
this is what two white officers in Providence, R.I. saw when they
saw Cornel Young Jr. It never occurred to the officers that Young
was an off-duty cop. It should be so obvious that the next question
is whether America so thoroughly conditioned those officers to see
black men as criminals it made it impossible for them to see Young
as a hero rushing to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   There is no rush by Providence's mayor, Vincent Cianci, to find
this out. Young, a 29-year-old African-American officer, was gunned
down by two white officers as he rushed out of a late-night diner
with his gun cocked to stop a brawl.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows why these two officers did not give this black
silhouette enough time to transform from faceless to friendly
before the hail of friendly fire. The question is particularly
grave since the officers shot not to wound but to kill. The
question is particularly poignant because Young and one of his
killers went to the same police academy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Cianci talks as if the role of race is either secondary or
irrelevant. He has said:
</P>
<P>
   --``I don't think there were any racial overtones that I can see
at this particular time.''
</P>
<P>
   --``Please, let's not take this incident and make it something
that it's not. Please, let's not let this be something that divides
the city.''
</P>
<P>
   --``I have no reason to believe it was racial, but I'm going to
listen to them, and if they give me any reason to believe it was,
we will look into that. But in my view, this situation was
unbelievable. This was a situation that couldn't be replicated in
any city in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Cianci was seconded by a police spokesman, Martin Hames. ``The
only color up here is blue,'' Hames said. ``It's not a racially
motivated incident as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be possible that racism did not pull the trigger. But we
will never know until we ask the questions.
</P>
<P>
   Cianci said, ``Let his light shine and help to heal a city
wounded by grief.'' There can be no healing if all the mayor offers
is darkness, a dark blue wall of silence.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, Cianci is dead wrong that this situation was
unbelievable, that it could not be replicated in any other city.
For black cops, this situation is a broken record.
</P>
<P>
   The number of off-duty black cops killed, wounded, or beaten by
friendly fire and friendly fists has piled up beyond any question
that it is a serious problem and a racial problem. In the 1990s,
three African-American officers were killed by white officers in
Washington. Three African-American officers were shot by white
officers in New York, one fatally. An African-American officer in
Baltimore was wounded. A plainclothes African-American female cop
was brutally clubbed with flashlights by 20 mostly white
Philadelphia officers.
</P>
<P>
   There is no definitive review on the color of victims and
assailants in cop-on-cop violence. But Roger Abel, founder of the
Guardians, a fraternal organzation for African-American officers,
said: ``We've had 28 black cops shot by white cops in friendly fire
incidents in the history of the NYPD. But there's never been one
white cop mistakenly shot by a black cop.'' To date, no one has
disputed Abel's facts.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Boston, of course, plainclothes Officer Michael Cox was
brutally beaten in an 1995 incident that involved both white and
black officers, which serves to underscore the power of the
faceless silhouette to make officers lose control. The issue is
less the color of the assailant than the color of the victim.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a blue wall of silence, we never found out what the
35 cops who saw the beating thought. They chose to outlast a
five-year statute of limitations, defiling Police Commissioner Paul
Evans and defying law enforcement officials all the way up to the
FBI. US Attorney Donald Stern said the cowardly officers either
fled from Cox, did not come forward, or ``outright lied.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by Cianci, the blue wall is already up in Providence.
His whole energy has gone into keeping black folks calm. Don't make
Young's death into something that it is not, he says. That is like
petting a dog after shooting its puppy.
</P>
<P>
   If Cianci is a serious leader instead of a patronizing one, he
would immediately make racism a key consideration. This is not
about finding out if the white officers were racist as people. This
is about distangling subtle threads, probing the unconscious,
trying to find why it is that another black cop became a faceless
and lifeless silhouette in the heat of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Should Cianci have the courage to try to distangle even one
thread, then and only then can he claim to have started the
healing. Only then can he ask for calm. That would be unbelievable.
That would be a situation that has not been replicated in any city
in the country.

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Joel and Susan Lewin have never needed a formal way to
commemorate the Holocaust. Their four children could always listen
to two grandparents recount how they eluded the Nazi death machine
in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   But since the death four years ago of their grandfather, a
survivor of Auschwitz, the Lewin children have had to face the
prospect that their 71-year-old grandmother will not always be
around to bear witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The survivors are the glue,'' said Joel Lewin, a Boston
attorney who was born in a displaced-persons camp. ``Their stories
won't be the same coming from us.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Lewin, like tens of thousands of other descendants of
Holocaust survivors, has devoted himself to learning about what
happened to European Jews in the 1930s and '40s.
</P>
<P>
   It is, he said, a common theme among several Jewish families as
the World War II generation ages. At the urging of their aging
parents, children of Holocaust survivors are grappling with
questions of how to guard and pass on their parents' sacred legacy
of endurance against all odds.
</P>
<P>
   There are 3,500 Holocaust survivors in Massachusetts and 140,000
in the country, according to the federal government. Holocaust
descendants say there are spirited debates over how younger
generations should tell the stories of one of humanity's darkest
chapters, even though they did not live through it.
</P>
<P>
   Some historians say it would be a mistake to entrust the telling
to a second generation that can offer only secondhand accounts
filtered through sympathetic eyes.
</P>
<P>
   But members of that generation, many of them now grandparents
themselves, say they want to make sure the Holocaust is not
relegated to dry history books.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, some say, forgetting the Holocaust seems unlikely,
given the sheer number of books, movies, and events devoted to
relating Nazi horrors, as society seeks to come to terms with the
passing of the World War II generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Holocaust has become a fashionable endeavor,'' said Nobel
Peace Prize laureate and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel at a recent
conference on Jewish displaced persons in Europe. ``Hollywood
discovered this. Broadway discovered this.''
</P>
<P>
   But survivors from Boston to Boca Raton, Fla., are prodding
their progeny not to presume the Holocaust will remain hot. Ripples
of public awareness stirred by the movie ``Schindler's List'' and
revelations about Swiss banks keeping unclaimed Jewish assets will
someday fade, survivors say.
</P>
<P>
   The second generation does not lack the will to keep the
memories alive, several say, but it may have different priorities.
For instance, the chairwoman of the second generation group at the
US Holocaust Memorial Museum said her peers may take a different
tack than their parents did with people who try to deny the
Holocaust occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are witnesses to the witnesses,'' said Rositta Kenigsberg,
of the museum's second generation advisers. ``We may place more of
an emphasis and be more watchful regarding the Holocaust deniers
and revisionists.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several at a Washington conference of survivors and
their offsprings earlier this month predicted that, after the
recent spate of monument- and museum-building, the second
generation will focus on education and outreach.
</P>
<P>
   A generational divide is apparent. For example, Kenigsberg
hosted an evening of Yiddish music at the conference, which drew
hundreds of people to the dance floor. While the survivors reveled
in the language and melodies of a bygone era, some of their
grandchildren were bewildered.
</P>
<P>
   Shira Lewin, 25, said that she and her sister Nora, 15, were
confused. ``There's so much Yiddish,'' said Lewin, of Brooklyn,
N.Y. ``It's alienating to Nora and me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lewins brought three of their four children to the
conference, where they met other descendants of survivors and
honored their grandmother, Marion Pasternak Lewin, who had been
hidden in a Christian home during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Lewin said his generation is ``hooked'' on preserving
Holocaust memory. ``It's hitting us now,'' he said, ``that we need
to stay organized enough to sustain the message.''
</P>
<P>
   Dena Salzberg, a child of survivors married to the son of a
survivor, has noticed a change of late in her parents and their
survivor friends. ``A lot of them are panicking because they want
to make sure their story will be told,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, she said, her introverted father made a point, while
he was hospitalized, of showing the tattooed number on his arm to
every nurse and orderly who tended him.
</P>
<P>
   Another second-generation member who is familiar with a
survivor's intense concern for future education is Michael Ross, a
new Boston city councilor and son of Holocaust survivor Steven
Ross.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the largest concerns is that the Holocaust doesn't
become just another event and falls into historical obscurity,''
Michael Ross said. ``The type and nature of the atrocity and the
fundamental evilness is something that has to be taught to children
so they recognize just how wrong this was.''
</P>
<P>
   Salzberg and Ross were among the children of survivors summoned
to a breakfast last year by their parents and a local survivor
group. Time to pick up the baton, they were told.
</P>
<P>
   Salzberg and Julie Ross, Michael's sister, have answered their
parents' call by founding Generations After, a local group that
recently was incorporated as a nonprofit organization.
</P>
<P>
   The group received a $2,000 grant from the Lenny Zakim fund,
named in honor of the late Anti-Defamation League leader, to supply
baskets of food and religious items to shut-in survivors during
Jewish holidays, Salzberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The group expects to branch into educational outreach activities
as it grows, Salzberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fears of many survivors, some academics say the
legacy is secure.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors' words and images are not as perishable as they
might have been before Yale University and Steven Spielberg's Shoah
foundation recorded 55,000 interviews with survivors in recent
years, said Lawrence Langer, a Simmons College professor emeritus
who conducted 70 of the Yale interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of the Holocaust does not depend on living
survivors,'' Langer said. In fact, survivors' tales can give the
false impression that all Jews had an option to avoid the gas
chambers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But heroism'' for millions of the murdered, he said, ``was not
an option.''

BRINGING HOME THE BACON WITH NEW ON-LINE AID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All anyone in Food World wants to know is: how much money did
New York Times writer Molly O'Neill land to launch her Web venture
At-Table.com, and how can I bite off my portion?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the answer to the first question is $10 million, most of
it raised from 16 individual investors (former Random House
chairman Alberto Vitale, Simon &AMP; Schuster president John Newcomb,
adman Lester Wunderman, venture capitalist Bill Ford, Michael
Hoffman of the Blackstone Group, etc.) who have purchased 20
percent of the company. The answer to the second question is: Many
are called, few are chosen.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill and her husband/business partner Arthur Samuelson have
sounded out most of the big names in the food universe _ Julia
Child, Jacques Pepin, Anne Willan _ but are still several weeks
from identifying their 12 ``brand name talent alliances.'' At-Table
has 27 employees and has already outgrown its offices on
Manhattan's West 36th St. The business plan calls for the staff to
double over the next few months. Outsiders will get their first
look at the site in April.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, O'Neill explains, is to use the Web site as a
``connective tissue'' linking journalism, television, and
cookbooks. ``I haven't spent 25 years in the food business to go
out and sell `Molly's marmalade.' '' In theory, At-Table could
deliver you a recipe, the history of the recipe, a video clip of
how to prepare the dish, or offer to sell you a book of similar
recipes. Six chefs will write a rotating column for the site, which
also plans to feature channels on home cooking, neighborhood chefs,
and ``food-centered travel writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuelson has been selling the site as a ``category killer,''
meaning it intends to extinguish the existing competition. ``I'd
say that, too, if I was launching a new Web site,'' chuckles Joan
Feeney, editorial director for Conde Nast's Web sites and the
founding editor of food site epicurious.com (www.epicurious.com).
``If you don't have some of that hyperbole in this business, it
doesn't even register.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeney used to work with O'Neill and remains a huge fan _ ``If
Molly opened a restaurant tomorrow, I'd be the first one in line''
_ but points out that her own site isn't exactly chopped liver.
Epicurious, published in partnership with Gourmet and Bon Appetit
magazines, is more than four years old, has spawned a TV show, and
gets about 2.5 million visitors each month. ``Epicurious has
established itself as the on-line authority for recipes and general
information about food,'' says Feeney.
</P>
<P>
   And there's another 800-pound gorilla roaming the jungle, a
woman even The New York Times calls the ``lifestyle dominatrix'':
Martha Stewart of marthastewart.com (www.marthastewart.com). Her
Web site, naturally, plugs her TV show, books, and other
publications. ``I think Martha is a genius,'' says Samuelson. ``We
want to create 12 Marthas _ there's plenty of room out there.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   There's a great flap winding down (alas) on Beacon Hill, pitting
the 217,000-member Unitarian Universalist church against its tony,
contentious neighbors. The Unitarians, who use several buildings on
the Hill as their North American headquarters, had started renting
out rooms, billing itself as a conveniently situated
bed-and-breakfast. Problem is, their space isn't zoned for
commercial use. Moreover, they had previously maintained that their
20 bedrooms were for the sole use of ``visiting church officials
and committee members.'' So imagine the neighbors' surprise when
they saw ads in Yankee magazine offering sojourns at the quaint
``Eliot and Pickett houses'' _ actually Unitarian facilities _ on
Beacon Hill.
</P>
<P>
   If the church didn't know who they were messing with, they do
now. The neighbors hired former City Council president Larry
DiCara, now a partner at Nixon &AMP; Peabody, to put the kibosh on a
planned renovation of their buildings until the Unitarians got out
of the lodging business. DiCara succeeded. The city's Inspectional
Services department halted the work until the Unitarians squared
themselves with the Licensing Board, which has jurisdiction over
bed-and-breakfasts. Just this week, the Unitarians informed the
Board they won't be putting up any more outsiders. ``The
commissioners agreed with our neighbors that we were outside the
bounds'' of existing regulations, admits church spokesman John
Hurley.

FRIENDS PAINT A PICTURE OF A `TENDER-HEARTED' RAY LEWIS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dale Fryzel, the football defensive coordinator and dean of
students at Kathleen High in Lakeland, Fla., in 1992, preached two
admonitions for his players to carry through life:
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay away from the buzzards and watch who you hang out with.
And don't stay out after midnight, because nothing good happens
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Lewis would laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Not out of defiance, for he was never that way. He was just the
opposite, in fact _ a unit cadet commander in the school chapter of
the Air Force ROTC; a junior deacon and choir member at his church,
Greater Faith Missionary Baptist; a ferocious competitor who
wouldn't tolerate less than consuming commitment from his teammates
while anchoring the football team as a linebacker, running back,
and kick returner, and winning the state 189-pound championship in
wrestling. A natural leader, his mentors _ Fryzel and head coaches
Ernest Joe in football, Steve Poole in wrestling _ and the athletic
director who doubled as sports trainer, Joe Morrell, could tell
instantly.
</P>
<P>
   No, Lewis wasn't mocking Fryzel's cautionary words. It's just
that he always seemed to be laughing when he wasn't competing,
always seemed to be having fun and telling jokes, always kept
things so upbeat that Morrell recalled, ``We never had a flat
practice with Ray around,'' and always was so popular that ``he was
a kid other kids liked to be around _ heck, I liked to be around
him, he was always so uplifting,'' recalled Poole.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, who would less need to heed Fryzel's warnings than
Lewis, who in his role as dean of students Poole said ``was never
in my office, never gave anyone any trouble, was really a model
student, you could say''?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than seven years later, Fryzel's gospel of moderation has
the eerie ring of tragic prophecy. Ray Lewis, the 24-year-old,
three-time Pro Bowl middle linebacker of the Baltimore Ravens who
is considered the most relentless tackler in the National Football
League, sits in an Atlanta City Jail cell, held without bail until
a Feb. 24 arraignment, accused of double homicide in the stabbing
deaths of two men in the wee hours Monday following a post-Super
Bowl party at an upscale Atlanta night spot.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is charged with the slayings of aspiring art student
Jacinth Baker, 21, and Richard Lollar, 24, stemming from a street
argument between the two men from suburban Decatur and the football
player's six-man entourage at 4 a.m., about an hour after the party
they attended at the Cobalt Lounge ended and some 200 yards from
the club.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis's attorneys maintain his innocence, Ed Garland describing
him at an Atlanta press conference Thursday as ``a horrified
bystander.'' And his family, friends, neighbors, teammates, and
former coaches all fervently believe _ or hope _ that this is so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't imagine a kid with his mentality doing that,''
said Auburn head coach Tommy Tuberville, Lewis's position coach
during the first two of his three years at the University of Miami,
1993-95. ``He's too smart.''
</P>
<P>
   There are conflicting accounts of what occurred in the predawn
maelstrom on the streets of Atlanta's high-rent entertainment
district.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Toskov, the owner of All Stretched Out Limousine
Service, which transported Lewis from his posh Owings Mills, Md.,
home during Super Bowl week and picked up some friends along the
way to Atlanta, said the driver, Duane Fossett, told him Lewis did
not commit the murders. Toskov further maintained that,
contradicting the testimony of witnesses who claim five shots were
fired from Lewis's limo as it fled the scene, the shots were fired
at the vehicle by another group. Toskov and Fossett declined
comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Fulton County (Ga.) district attorney spokesman Erik Friedly
said Lewis still can be tried for murder _ and with it a sentence
of life in prison or the death penalty if prosecutors request it _
even if he didn't wield the weapon. Assisting the killer or being
involved in the fight that led to the slayings would make Lewis
culpable.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the words of another of Lewis's lawyers, Max
Richardson Jr., serve as an illustrative epilogue to Fryzel's
advice: ``He was in the wrong place at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps with the wrong crowd. His Ravens teammates
reportedly had become increasingly concerned by the group with
which Lewis constantly surrounded himself in recent months. And if
anything, the charges evoke the murkier side of an otherwise almost
saintly portrait. Though no charges ever have been filed, Lewis was
accused of physically abusing two pregnant women at the University
of Miami, one the mother of his two children; and a third woman in
a Baltimore lounge last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to be really careful where you go and who you go out
with,'' said offensive tackle Jonathan Ogden from Honolulu, where
Lewis was supposed to be working out with the AFC Pro Bowl team for
Sunday's game. ``Know your situation as soon as you get there.
People are sometimes looking for an excuse to start something up
with a player. It's unfortunate, but it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville Jaguars Pro Bowl offensive tackle Leon Searcy, a
friend of Lewis's who graduated from Miami the year before he got
there, added, ``It's unfortunate he may have associated himself
with some people that really didn't take his reputation
wholeheartedly. He just happened to be the face in the crowd
everybody picked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nobody can empathize with Lewis more than Ravens safety
Bennie Thompson, who several years ago was the main suspect in the
murders of his son and former wife in New Orleans before being
cleared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know him as well as anybody on the team,'' Thompson told The
Sun of Baltimore. ``I know what he was thinking about Monday night.
He was thinking about where he was going to be spending the rest of
his life and if he was going to be in jail. He was thinking about
his family, how they were going to be supported, and if he was ever
going to play this game again.''
</P>
<P>
   Several members of his family _ including his grandmother,
Elease McKinney, who raised him _ are in Atlanta to lend support.
Some flew in from Honolulu, where Lewis had intended to treat them
to a Pro Bowl vacation. Also on hand are Tatyana McCall, to whom
Lewis is not married but is the mother of his sons Ray, 4, and
Rayshawn, 2; and Ravens team chaplain the Rev. Rod Hairston, who
called him ``a tenderhearted man. (The murders) would be
inconsistent with his character.''
</P>
<P>
   They would be antithetical to his character, according to those
who knew him during his formative years and his neighbors in an
exclusive suburban Baltimore enclave of million-dollar homes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Lakeland, Elease, an elementary school teacher, and her
husband, Gillis McKinney, a phosphate mine worker, oversaw a
sprawling extended family that included their four daughters and
five grandchildren born to one of those daughters, Sunseria
``Buffy'' Keith: Ray and younger brother Keon Lattimore, sister
Kadajia Lattimore, and twin sisters LaQuesha and Lakeisha Jenkins.
Lewis's father, Ray Jackson _ whom Joe, a teammate, remembers as
being ``a great defensive back and wrestler'' at Kathleen High _
was not in the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis's aunt, Gwen Miller, remembered him as ``a role model as
the oldest of the grandchildren. He'd keep us laughing. He was so
down-to-earth. He never got in trouble. And now he's the same old
baby Ray.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller recalls that when Lewis headed off to the University of
Miami, he told his grandmother, ``Nanny, I'm going to go pro and
pay our church off. And he did.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said that on his first visit home after signing with
the Ravens, he took 29 children to a local mall and bought each two
pairs of sneakers, then had a playground set built in the backyard
for the kids.

UP CLOSE BUT IMPERSONAL WITH JANET FLANNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
Janet, My Mother, And Me 
A Memoir of Growing Up with Janet Flanner and Natalia Danesi
Murray 
William Murray, Simon &AMP; Schuster, 224 pp., $24 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Readers of a certain age will recall that the ``Janet'' in the
title is Janet Flanner, The New Yorker magazine writer who gave the
world a fortnightly dose of sharp observation and lapidary metaphor
in her ``Letter from Paris.'' They might also remember Natalia
Danesi Murray, Flanner's longtime companion and soulmate. But they
probably will be hard put to place William Murray, Natalia's son.
And that, unfortunately, is part of the problem with this memoir,
which sputters and clunks along where it should race.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, author of the Shifty Lou Anderson series of racetrack
mysteries and a New Yorker staff member for 30 years, was 14 in
1940 when his mother met Flanner. It was, Murray writes, ``a coup
de foudre, a thunderbolt that had instantly sent them rushing into
each other's arms and forever altered their lives, as well as
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanner, raised in a Quaker home in Indiana, was well-ensconced
in Paris and had been writing for The New Yorker since 1925. The
Italian-born Natalia was an earthy, tempestuous Renaissance woman
who worked in theater and publishing. Although the two were often
on separate continents, their relationship endured until Flanner's
death in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Murray floated through their lives with apparent ease and no
small degree of admiration. Long before the homosexual world turned
gay, Murray writes, he felt entirely at home in his mother's circle
of closeted artists and writers on Fire Island.
</P>
<P>
   Bouncing between houses and lives and continents, Murray tried
to find his footing. He chronicles his bad decisions and blind
alleys. He dabbles in publishing, translates Pirandello's plays,
sings onstage, and writes a novel. But memoir is more than
travelogue. Murray doesn't temper history with the kind of insight
that is acquired over time, and his research is shallow. Flanner
seems oversized but flat, like a billboard viewed at close range.
Whole decades of American arts and letters pass without much
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The most sharply drawn portions of the book are his descriptions
of his tenure at The New Yorker. He met the magazine's
self-effacing editor, William Shawn, on a stifling summer day in
1956. As Shawn's secretary ushers Murray into the inner sanctum,
she advises him: ``Steel yourself.'' Murray finds Shawn at work
behind stacks of manuscripts. The air-conditioning is off, and the
summer sun is beating in. Although the temperature hovers around
100 degrees, Shawn is dressed in a dark blue suit, white shirt, bow
tie, and red wool sweater.
</P>
<P>
   The lowdown about the arbiters of high culture can be delicious,
of course. Murray on Shawn: ``The bitter fact is that I also
learned not to trust him completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray on getting published: ``I can assure you, without too
much rancor, that if I were a blind Hindu (a reference to Ved
Mehta, whose very long articles seemed to get into print as soon as
he finished them), a three-named English lady authoress or a friend
of Edith Oliver's (Edith, a close friend of Shawn's, seemed to have
his ear on whom to publish and when), my pieces would get read
quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   The strongest voice in the book, by far, is Flanner's. To his
credit, Murray reprints some letters that were not included in
``Darlinghissima,'' the book Natalia edited. On New Year's Day,
1954, Flanner wrote Natalia a luminous letter reflecting on their
relationship. In it, Flanner lamented their separation and, ever
insecure, doubted her own passion for writing. ``I seem to have
changed not at all but to have dilapidated, like a plaster
statue,'' she notes. ``I have made you pay the highest human price
for my work which cannot have been worth flesh, blood and hope.''
</P>
<P>
   But she never doubts her passion for Natalia. ``When this year's
summer comes in with June it will be 14 years since we met and fell
in love. We have had our long and intense floral season. Nothing
can replace it, nothing mow it down in memory and value of harvest
. . . I embrace you, sitting by my window, in imagination and look
forward with tense expectation to seeing you and kissing you on the
riverside. That tense look for the waiting face and body on land.
Yours, both.''

`SCREAM 3' IS A WITLESS CAST REUNION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
SCREAM 3 
Directed by: Wes Craven 
Screenplay by: Ehren Kruger 
Starring: David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox Arquette,
Patrick Dempsey, Scott Foley, Lance Henriksen, Matt Keeslar, Jenny
McCarthy, Emily Mortimer, Parker Posey, Deon Richmond, Patrick
Warburton 
Running time: 116 minutes 
Rated: R (strong horror violence and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They never know when to stop. Serial killers, serial filmmakers,
the line grows blurrier than ever in ``Scream 3.'' There's a lot of
talk about closure and resolution surrounding it, but all it really
does is come full circle to become the same sort of empty gorefest
on which the first ``Scream'' so smartly put some fresh spin. In
other words, it has become what it once so saucily goofed on.
What's missing from ``Scream 3'' is both the cleverness and the
vital impulse that powered the first and, to a lesser degree, the
second.
</P>
<P>
   With Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox Arquette and
Liev Schreiber returning, ``Scream 3'' plays more like a staid
alumni reunion than anything genuinely scary. Arquette and Cox,
whose romance began on the set of the first ``Scream,'' bring a
perhaps inevitable settled quality to their respective roles of
plodding cop and ruthless TV reporter. What they project now is
more like an affection born of familiarity than anything like real
edge. Without giving away too many plot details, let's just say
that Schreiber isn't much of a presence this time, while Campbell's
constantly menaced Sidney is hard-pressed to sustain even a minimal
energy level, much less an electrifying one, as she spends most of
the film running away before turning around and fighting, once
she's cornered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scream 3'' is cast as a film within a film called ``Stab 3,''
based on the supposed real-life ``Scream'' characters. There's some
wit in the confrontations between the original characters and their
filmic counterparts, especially when it involves Cox's reporting
shark, Gale Weathers, and Parker Posey's fictionalized Hollywood
version of her. But while this latest effort is lively as it goes
through the motions of linking the denouement to a secret from the
past of Sidney's mother, there isn't an atom of urgency in it as
the inventiveness of the first two installments recedes to the dumb
teen horror convention that depends for suspense on people never
sticking together and constantly going alone into dark, spooky
spaces even though they know that the killer in the droopy
death's-head mask with his endless supply of knives is lurking
about. For all its stage blood and shrieking, for all the dubious
allure of its sliced-and-diced babes on parade, ``Scream 3'' is a
lame little flatliner.

STUDY: CANDIDATES WIN, VOTERS LOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While New Hampshire victors Al Gore and John McCain seem to be
the chief beneficiaries of media attention, the loser is the
American voter, according to a survey of campaign coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The snapshot of two weeks of stories found that Gore and McCain
did better in setting the tone of their coverage than rivals Bill
Bradley and George Bush. The public was considerably less efficient
at influencing the media, however, with the survey concluding that
only 13 percent of the campaign stories ``dealt with matters that
affected mainly citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these stories could be made relevant,'' says Tom
Rosenstiel, head of the Project for Excellence in Journalism, which
released the study Thursday. ``But they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey examined 430 stories from five newspapers and nine
television programs during a week in December and a week in
January. The papers were The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer, USA Today,
The Orlando Sentinel, The Washington Post, and The New York Times.
The programs were the ABC, NBC, CBS, and PBS evening news shows,
the ABC, NBC, and CBS morning programs, CNN's ``The World Today,''
and CNN's ``Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Though acknowledging the study's limited scope, Rosenstiel says
``they are fairly representative weeks . . . and the character of
the coverage is almost identical.'' The key finding was that the
coverage overwhelmingly ``focused on matters that impact the
politicians or parties, such as changes in tactics, who has more
money or internal organizational problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Assessing the candidates' treatment, the survey said Gore ``was
nearly three times as likely as Bradley to get coverage of his
policy ideas'' while Bradley was 10 times more likely than Gore to
face stories about his ``personality or personal fitness.'' On the
Republican side, 40 percent of the stories about McCain were
``candidate-driven'' _ triggered by his actions _ compared to only
26 percent for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   One surprising finding in this era of presidential infidelity
and rumors of candidates' prior drug use is that only 5 percent of
the stories were framed around the so-called character issue.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenstiel chalks that up to the media's fascination with
strategy, noting that ``whenever anything is this tactical, it
overwhelms the question of character.''

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
A MAP OF THE WORLD 
Directed by: Scott Elliott 
Screenplay by: Peter Hedges, Polly Platt (based on Jane Hamilton's
novel) 
Starring: Sigourney Weaver, Julianne Moore, David Straithairn,
Arliss Howard, Chloe Sevigny, Louise Fletcher, Sara Rue, Aunjanue
Ellis, Nicole Ari Parker, Bruklin Harris, Ron Lea, Dara Perlmutter,
Kayla Perlmutter, Marc Donato 
Running time: 127 minutes 
Rated: R (some sexuality and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A Map of the World'' gives Sigourney Weaver her best role in
years. As a Wisconsin farm wife, mother and school nurse named
Alice Goodwin, she's both smart-mouthed and emotionally vulnerable.
Weaver has the chops to encompass her character's welcome
complexity, barbed humor, strength, demoralization, and redemption.
It's a pleasure to see an actress of her caliber being so fully
employed in more than the vocational sense. Vivid, complicated, not
always her own best friend, Weaver's Alice is both powerful and
satisfyingly nuanced, partly because she can push off against
strong performances from Julianne Moore as her best friend and
David Straithairn as her husband. In all, ``A Map of the World'' is
an uncommonly satisfying workout and an impressive film debut for
stage director Scott Elliott, who obviously knows how to work with
actors.
</P>
<P>
   The story is one of a woman whose hectic but happy life is
yanked out from under her by two jolting events. First, her best
friend's young daughter drowns in her pond, a circumstance that
causes the locals to cloak Alice in a collective pall of unspoken
blame. Later, the unruly young son of a woman with whom she had had
run-ins at school accuses Alice of sexual abuse. A few weeks ago,
everything in Alice's life seemed solid. Now nothing does. Alice
doesn't help herself when she replies sarcastically to police
interrogators who, like most people in the community, tend toward
literal-mindedness. Weaver is best when she's tucked into an orange
jump suit and chucked into jail. Because she's devastated, a few of
the other inmates gang up on her and she's too stunned to resist
the taunts and jibes of women who revel in seeing someone from what
in their eyes is a privileged class brought low.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, you feel that Alice can rally, but she needs
help. A highly competent lawyer (Arliss Howard) is engaged,
Straithairn's spouse bites the bullet financially, and Moore's best
friend figures importantly, too. The film captures a believable
dynamic of women who are friends, still liking one another, but now
separated by pain and, in Alice's case, guilt. Although things can
never be the same between them, Moore's character, Theresa, stays
in their lives. She, her husband, and Alice's are decent people,
but you can feel the increasing strains among them as the pressure
piles up. Just as you're convinced by the believable texture of
their lives, so are you wrenched by the dislocations. Elliott and
the actors display rare finesse in conveying the sexual tension
that develops between Theresa and Alice's husband, almost by way of
filling a vacuum. These scenes between Straithairn and Moore are
some of the film's most exquisitely and agonizingly tense and
sentient.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly with an eye to mimicking the way Alice's life turns
chaotic, the film tends to sprawl in its second half. But even
here, Alice's moral journey in prison stays vital. Weaver makes us
believe that prison isn't all a nightmare, that it's even a kind of
refuge from her problems, with a chance for expiation in her
treatment by some of the abusive prisoners. The film could have
been tightened, but its unruly contours are in keeping with the
turbulent emotional storms into which Alice is tossed. The
important thing is that it does the job of keeping us involved,
wondering whether, and how, she'll make her way back from hell _ a
major step being what Moore's grieving best friend will say about
her in court. ``A Map of the World'' gives three first-rate actors
a chance to stretch, and they do.

accelerated into the new year, as employers added 387,000 jobs _
the biggest gain in more than two years. The January gain
contributed to an increase of 0.4 percent, or 6 cents, the biggest
since September, and depressed the unemployment rate to a 30-year
low of 4 percent from 4.1 percent. The numbers were much stronger
than what Wall Street expected and may bolster market expectations
that the Federal Reserve will act vigorously this year in raising
interest rates. The market reaction is muted, with stocks up
modestly, and bonds down slightly. By Louis Uchitelle.

<P>
   KIMCHI (Hoengsung-Gun, South Korea) _ Ever since Japan colonized
the Korean peninsula during the first half of the 20th century,
Koreans have harbored an underlying resentment toward the Japanese.
But the latest incarnation of that resentment is not an uproar over
newly disclosed wartime atrocities by Japan's military or a fresh
instance of discrimination against ethnic Koreans living in Japan.
It is, instead, a growing anger over what some Koreans view as
Japan's attempt to co-opt their national dish: kimchi, a garlicky,
peppery, overwhelmingly pungent pickled cabbage. Kimchi has been a
staple of the Korean diet for centuries, and in recent years has
become an increasingly popular and lucrative export _ particularly
to the Japanese market. But now, the Korean kimchi industry is
seething because Japanese foodmakers are marketing their own
copycat kimchi _ and worse, calling it kimchi. By Calvin Sims.

UNION OFFERS GUARDED PRAISE FORD'S COMPUTER PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A United Auto Workers official praised Ford
Motor Co.'s plan to provide its 350,000 employees with a home
computer, but said the union is concerned that the company might
use the technology to intrude on workers' leisure time.
</P>
<P>
   The automotive company announced Thursday that it would provide
its employees _ from line workers to managers _ with a home
computer, printer and Internet link for a nominal fee of $5 per
month or less.
</P>
<P>
   The hardware, which includes a 500 MHz computer and color ink
jet printer, will be provided by Hewlett-Packard Co. and the UUNet
unit of MCI WorldCom will provide the Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   Employees also will receive two e-mail addresses along with a
personal Web site with 10MB of storage and Web publishing tools.
Employees will be able to upgrade to more powerful computers at
their own expense.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Krell, a UAW spokesman in Detroit, was cautious in
embracing the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that Ford will probably be sending out e-mails to
workers at their homes,'' he said, ``but we're stressing to our
membership that they are free to ignore them and to use judgment
and discretion in utilizing the computers.''
</P>
<P>
   The program ``will let us also communicate with our members,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The program will be administered by PeoplePC Inc., a 4-month-old
San Francisco company that provides computers and Internet
connections for a flat monthly rate.
</P>
<P>
   A similar package from PeoplePC costs $24.95 a month for 36
months. PeoplePC would not disclose Ford's costs for the program.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, PeoplePC will set up the computers to
automatically log into a PeoplePC/Ford corporate home page, where
the company will post information for its employees.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Grouf, the chief executive of PeoplePC, said Ford users
would be free to reconfigure their computers to eliminate the Ford
home page.

 &HT;    SOLDIER OUSTED OVER U.N. INSIGNIA FINDS HOPE AT APPEALS HEARING
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pointed questions from military judges provided
hope to Michael New on Friday in the former Army medic's solitary
crusade against wearing United Nations insignia.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the nation's highest military tribunal seemed to
agree that the judge in New's 1996 court-martial erred in not
allowing a jury to consider whether an order that he don a blue
U.N. helmet and patches was lawful under Army regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we prevailed,'' said Henry Hamilton, the lawyer who
argued New's case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed
Forces.
</P>
<P>
   New, who lives in a suburb of Houston, was convicted of refusing
to obey his commander's order to wear the U.N. insignia after his
infantry unit was deployed from Germany to join multinational
peacekeeping forces in Macedonia in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton argued that these orders were illegal not only because
President Clinton ``lied to Congress'' in authorizing the
deployment, but also because Army regulations prohibit such
alterations to the uniform.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves two streams of military justice, Hamilton
argued. One is that a soldier must obey lawful orders from a
superior officer. But the second is that a soldier cannot be
compelled to obey an illegal order, and may indeed be duty-bound to
disobey an unlawful order.
</P>
<P>
   Several judges seemed to accept Hamilton's argument that jurors
on the court-martial panel should have been allowed to consider
whether the orders issued to New were proper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole trial was about whether the order was lawful or
not,'' said Judge Eugene R. Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   If a separate system of justice is to exist for the armed
forces, ``why can't we trust a military panel to determine if an
order is legal?'' asked Judge Andrew Effron.
</P>
<P>
   The judges took the case under advisement and will likely not
issue a ruling for months.
</P>
<P>
   The five judges on the appeals court for the armed forces are
civilians appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.
If they uphold New's conviction, he could take his case to civilian
courts. Although he received a bad-conduct discharge following his
court martial, New is technically still in the Army until his
appeals are exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, the 26-year-old New stood with his wife,
Claudia, in falling snow and said ``it's great to see us moving
again'' on the nearly five-year-old case.
</P>
<P>
   He said the key issues remain ``whether it is legal to order
U.S. soldiers to wear the uniforms of foreign nations and to obey
foreign commanders.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his case has faded from the newspaper headlines and
network TV newscasts, New has remained a folk hero to those who
suspect the United Nations of subverting nationalism to a sinister
new world order. A dozen or so supporters were at the court
proceedings on Friday and handed out videotapes titled ``Good
Conduct: The Story of Michael New.''

   Commentary

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For my money, there may be no worse time to be
in the news business than after fatalities in the crash of a
commercial airplane. Especially one that, like Alaska Airlines
Flight 261, is in your professional back yard.
</P>
<P>
   The very essence of the journalist's job _ to serve as a
detached but minutely informed witness _ never seems more futile or
empty.
</P>
<P>
   Never is the tangible ``good'' that journalism can do more
confined to merely providing facts.
</P>
<P>
   Never does the explanation, ``It's news,'' so lamely justify the
invasion of private grief or poorly satisfy the tender soul.
</P>
<P>
   After the initial questions are answered (Where was the plane
coming from and going? How many people died? What might have caused
the crash?) all healthy human instinct is to begin to turn away.
</P>
<P>
   Except to the heartbroken intimates of the dead, the details of
the story start to become little vicarious penknives for digging
and twisting into the emotional and psychological flesh.
</P>
<P>
   The longer you dig the less you can avoid identifying with 88
strangers hurtling toward the sea: Did they know? They must have
known. How horrible was ... Don't go there.
</P>
<P>
   All but the extremely Zen or fatalistic grow queasy and cold
contemplating the cruel, capricious, disorderly conduct of
disaster: You can't see it coming. There is NOTHING you can do. Is
it around the next corner? Don?t go there.
</P>
<P>
   Then fear of fear and distaste for discomfort soon triumph over
the temptation to keep looking: That's enough. Time to read the
sports pages. Or make love. Or poke fun at George W. Bush and Al
Gore. Go THERE.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the professional witnesses, the journalists, continue
to look and to gather and dispense information.
</P>
<P>
   _ Among the first four bodies found, one was an infant.
</P>
<P>
   _ The accountant from Sebastopol, Calif., was in Mexico
attending a condominium owners meeting.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Realtor from Mercer Island, Wash., left a widow who feels
``extremely blessed to have had him in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The journalists will not stop, cannot stop, until the process of
their profession has run its course. Certainly not devoid of the
human instinct to turn away when the accumulation of facts starts
to disturb and sicken, they use the mechanics of the process to
bolster their detachment.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those mechanics are learned, not in the college
classroom or reporter's manual, but over time in covering courts,
cops, school boards, four-alarm fires, corrupt politicians, Good
Samaritans, kidnappings, busted savings-and-loans, land development
scandals, nursing home deaths, drunken drivers, premature miracle
babies, serial murderers, the home team's opening day and _ once in
a truly unfortunate while _ plane crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the story breaks, the process kicks in and tradition
dictates the action. Fears, aversions and doubts are kept to
oneself. So are any existential questions about the value of all
the gathered information or any moral questions about the propriety
of the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   That is the news business. At its core, it's a pretty simple
job. But, sometimes, more than others, it can be very, very hard to
do.

EVEN MOORE'S SMILE CAN'T REFRESH THIS CHUNK OF STALE FUDGE 
</HEADLINE>

MARY AND RHODA 
Starring: Mary Tyler Moore, Valerie Harper, Joie Lenz, Marisa Ryan,
Elon Gold 
Directed by: Barnett Kellman 
On: ABC 
Time: Monday night at 8 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   . . . And she lived happily ever after.
</P>
<P>
   No wait. Mary stayed single. She moved to an Upper East Side
studio in New York, where Gordy got her a news job. She wasn't
famous, she never saw Rhoda, and she died of breast cancer at 50,
alone.
</P>
<P>
   No wait. Mary did get married _ but it was to a woman! She moved
to New York, Gordy got her a news job, and a young female colleague
befriended her. Their deep connection turned romantic, they rented
a U-Haul, they bought a Village co-op, and they were among the
first visible lesbians to have kids. Rhoda was a fabulous
godmother.
</P>
<P>
   No wait, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   What ever happened to mystery? Aren't there questions in this
world that should always remain unanswered, no matter how much we
want to know? Aren't there questions for which any answer would be
sorely inadequate?
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong: I swallowed the first few minutes of the new
TV movie ``Mary and Rhoda'' like a cold Orange Crush on a hot
summer day. Of course fans of ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' want to
catch up with two of the most likeable sitcom characters ever
created. Through the easy intimacy of the small screen, we built
bonds with Mary Richards and Rhoda Morgenstern Gerard in the 1970s,
and they became icons of their time. Most of us aren't exactly
disinterested in their futures. That is precisely why ABC is
presenting this stale fudge square of a TV movie, at 8 p.m., during
a sweeps month: They know we want to know.
</P>
<P>
   But wanting to know and knowing are quite different affairs, and
in the case of ``Mary and Rhoda,'' wanting to know is the better
way. Sure, it's greatly satisfying to see Mare after all these
years, looking as spry as ever (if a little tighter in the cheeks
and wider in the mouth). And Rhoda, with her heavy accent, is still
the best best friend going. And that Midwestern-vs.-New York
chemistry between Moore and Valerie Harper is alive, with Rhoda
noting wryly to Mary, ``Yowuh pawties haven't lawst theyah magic.''
(Translation: ``Your parties haven't lost their magic.'')
</P>
<P>
   But the scenario and plot created for ``Mary and Rhoda'' is
wrong-headed, to say the least. For some crazy reason, the writers
decided that Rhoda has been living in Paris for many years with her
second husband, a snake named Jean-Pierre. (Her name is now Rhoda
Rousseau!) Her Paris-raised daughter, who is suspiciously
accent-free, is a med student in New York, and so Rhoda walks out
on her husband, visits her daughter, and tries to market herself as
an artist.
</P>
<P>
   Mary, meanwhile, is a mother and a recent widow who finds _
surprise! _ that she didn't inherit any money, and that she must
get a job immediately. She's back where she was in 1970, in the
premiere episode of ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show.'' Of course, she
doesn't for a moment consider selling her spectacular duplex
apartment, where she now lives alone. And so she brings her spunk,
of which she still has plenty, into the cynical world of network
news 2000, where she works for an amoral man young enough to be her
son. As she battles to bring media integrity to the masses, you may
find yourself uttering Mr. Grant's famous words, ``I hate spunk.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few decades of estrangement, Mary and Rhoda bond in an
awful Central Park sequence, which has Mary loosening up and
donning Rhoda's floppy hat. And soon the mother-daughter melodrama
comes creeping in, with Mary ashamed of her daughter's show-biz
aspirations and Rhoda pronouncing to her daughter, ``Right now I
need to be Rhoda. Not Jean-Pierre's wife, or Meredith's mom. Just
Rhoda.'' ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' was a comedy, wasn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the movie contains not a single mention of Mr. Grant, or
Murray, or Phyllis. But maybe we should be grateful for that. Lousy
reunion movies run the risk of sullying their classic ancestors.
The fewer connections ``Mary and Rhoda'' makes between itself and
``The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' the better. The only good news about
``Mary and Rhoda'' is that Moore and Harper originally wanted it to
be a series. Phew!
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Mary Tyler Moore can still turn the world on with her
smile. But, alas, even she can't take a nothing movie and suddenly
make it all seem worthwhile.

BAUER WITHDRAWS FROM REPUBLICAN RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gary L. Bauer withdrew from the presidential race
Friday, vowing to continue preaching his message of conservative
religious values and declining _ for now _ to endorse anyone else
for the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer used an oft-quoted phrase from Theodore Roosevelt (``The
credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face
is marred by dust and sweat and blood ...'') to emphasize that he
had no regrets about the work he put into his long-shot candidacy,
or its end.
</P>
<P>
   And he pledged to be ``a major factor in the debate in the
country'' on issues like abortion, which he opposes without
compromise, and American eagerness to trade with China, a policy
that he equated with ``betraying who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said he would not endorse any candidate for the nomination
until he saw how their positions evolved on the issues that have
been bedrock to him. ``I just will say that those that are still in
the race seem very interested in my endorsement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the two leading contenders, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, could not immediately be
reached for comment Friday on how interested they are in Bauer's
support, and what they might do to get it.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why his message had not caught on with the people, Bauer
said that it had, if not in votes then in its effect on the other
candidates. ``I heard my words even when my lips weren't moving,''
he said, asserting that his message had led others in the
Republican race to try to sound as conservative as possible.
</P>
<P>
   William R. Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard
and a close friend of Bauer, agreed that Bauer has had an influence
on political debate, and that he will continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
   As for why Bauer had not caught on with more voters, Kristol
said 2000 is shaping up as ``a non-ideological year,'' and that
McCain fills some voters' needs by being ``a non-ideological type
of insurgent.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer congratulated McCain for his big victory in New Hampshire,
lauding him as ``a good and decent man.'' And a moment later, he
was generous as well toward Bush and the two other candidates, Alan
Keyes and Steve Forbes: ``They are all good and decent people.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion has been a dicey issue for both McCain and Bush. Both
have said they basically oppose it. Bush has also said he is
comfortable with the basic Republican platform, which calls for a
constitutional amendment to ban abortion, while McCain has said he
would like to see the platform modified to include exceptions in
cases of rape, incest or to save the woman's life.
</P>
<P>
   To further complicate matters, both Bush and McCain responded to
hypothetical personal questions recently by saying that under some
circumstances they would respect a relative's decision to choose
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   To shore up their anti-abortion credentials with conservatives,
Bush and McCain might welcome the backing of Bauer, who has never
been ambiguous. Kristol thought it might be significant that,
having tried to portray himself as more conservative than McCain on
abortion, Bush seemed no closer than McCain to getting Bauer's
support.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer has said that, if he were president, he would appoint only
strict anti-abortion jurists to the Supreme Court. He calls fetuses
``unborn children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On this issue, I will not be moved,'' he said Friday. ``On
this issue, I will not go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday whether he would consider the No. 2 spot on the
Republican ticket, he said. ``I ... it would be very flattering.''

   The Senate on Wednesday approved, 83-14, a bill that would
overhaul the bankruptcy system by making it more difficult for
people to erase their debts. The measure also raises the hourly
minimum wage by $1 to $6.15 over the next three years and slashes
various business taxes by $76 billion over ten years. The bill also
includes a provision that would prevent violent protesters at
abortion clinics from using bankruptcy laws to evade fines and
damages. Supporters said the bill is needed to prevent people who
can afford to pay off their debts from taking advantage of
loopholes in current law. Opponents, including President Clinton,
said some of the bankruptcy provisions were unfair and said the tax

WILLIE B. IS GONE, BUT HIS SPIRIT LINGERS ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is hardly a better _ or bigger _ symbol of hope than
Willie B.
</P>
<P>
   Once called the loneliest gorilla in the world, Willie B. lived
through unrelenting adversity for decades and then, in his final
years, enjoyed a remarkably rich life. The 41-year-old Western
lowland gorilla died Wednesday in his sleeping quarters at Zoo
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Lonely no more, the aged gentleman of the zoo's gorilla
population was surrounded by members of his gorilla bond group and
by the humans who had grown to love him when his heart finally gave
out.
</P>
<P>
   His story is about the remarkable resilience of animals and it
also tells the tale of the transformation of zoos. It would be
anthropomorphic to say Willie B. had a forgiving nature, or that he
exuded charisma. But there is no doubt that this highly intelligent
and expressive being captured the imaginations and hearts of the
people who flocked to see him in what is now considered one of the
best zoos in the country.
</P>
<P>
   I was among Willie B.'s admirers and was able to visit the great
gorilla several times. He was always impressive. Separated by a
thick pane of safety glass, you could sit right next to him and be
dwarfed by his magnificent frame _ 450 pounds of muscle covered in
a dense black coat that shimmered gray in a saddle across his back.
In the world of gorillas, the silverback is the boss.
</P>
<P>
   And it was easy to see why. Willie B. could stand six feet tall
and his neck measured 40 inches around.
</P>
<P>
   Once, in 1981, an Atlanta TV station gave Willie B. a suitcase
in order to re-create a popular luggage commercial that showed an
ape pounding _ but not breaking _ the product. Within minutes,
Willie had ripped the two sides of the suitcase from the hinges. He
then filled one half with water and drank from it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he appeared the image of a gentle giant as he chose to sit
close to the glass and the people on the other side of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a people guy,'' says zoo spokeswoman Gail Eaton. ``He
loved people and loved to make eye contact. On rainy, cold days,
when there weren't many visitors, he'd sit near the viewing area
and, I swear, he looked crestfallen if no one came around.''
</P>
<P>
   I was so taken with him that I began the first chapter of my
first book with his story. There was such a happy ending to the
grim beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Willie B. was captured in Africa while still an infant. From
what we know of the bloody animal trade of the time, it is likely
that several members of his group, probably including his mother,
were killed in order to secure him.
</P>
<P>
   Separated from the bonds of his family group and removed from
the rich, lush forests of Cameroon, Willie B. landed in Atlanta in
1961. And for the next 27 years, this social primate lived alone in
a concrete box with bars _ and a television set. He never saw
another gorilla. He would lie on his side, legs crossed, one arm
thrown over his head, staring blankly at the crowd. Zoogoers would
often jeer or scream at him in a misguided attempt to get him up
and moving.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting gorillas in these ``hard'' zoo settings was, according
to zoo director Terry Maple, ``like visiting a mental ward: The
occupants were seen as crazy and self-destructive.''
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, Willie B.s home was listed as one of the worst zoos
in the country. In 1984, it lost its accreditation. Life was as
barren and uneventful as it could be. Days, months, and years
passed by in unimaginable monotony.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the mid-'80s, Maple, a primatologist, became the zoo's
director with a mandate to turn things around. He was determined to
create a ``soft,'' natural environment so that Willie B. could
socialize and forage much as gorillas do in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   A full 10 percent of Zoo Atlanta's acreage was devoted to a new
gorilla enclosure at a cost of $4.5 million. Maple moved mountains
for the gorilla: 26,000 tons of soil shifted, 3,500 shrubs planted.
</P>
<P>
   And so, on a muggy morning in May, 1988, Willie B.'s life
forever changed. The gate separating his indoor enclosure from the
outside world opened. Willie B. cautiously emerged, exploring
trees, grass, and sky until the novel sensation of tiny raindrops
drove the massive animal inside.
</P>
<P>
   Soon things got even better. The next year, Willie B. was
carefully introduced to female gorillas. No one knew how he would
react. An animal raised in such unnatural conditions might, in
fact, turn violent at the sight of his own kind.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the smaller but more socially advanced female gorillas
dominated Willie B. But he caught on fast and just two months after
meeting Kinyani, he copulated for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Willie B.'s impoverished life became enriched. Companionship,
sunshine, and birdsong replaced solitude, fluorescent lighting, and
the echo of clanking metal doors.
</P>
<P>
   The self-assured ape went on to father five babies at Zoo
Atlanta: Kudzoo, Olympia, Sukari, Kidogo, and Lulu.
</P>
<P>
   He lived much like a wild gorilla. He foraged for food outdoors,
dominated a small group, and was even able to watch other gorilla
groups in nearby enclosures.
</P>
<P>
   But at 41, Willie B. was one of the oldest gorillas in captivity
and the oldest captive male in the United States to be producing
offspring. Renowned gorilla researcher Dian Fossey believed the
animals could live well into their 50s, but that figure is still a
matter of some conjecture. The oldest captive gorilla, Massa, lived
to be 54 in the Philadelphia zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, Willie B. had been off exhibit in the care of the
zoo's veterinary staff after being diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, a
serious heart condition that reduces the ability of the heart to
contract.
</P>
<P>
   The condition is not curable, but it is treatable, and this past
week, Willie B. seemed to be responding to care. ``His lungs had
cleared, and he was alert,'' Eaton says. ``We thought that the big
old boy just might make it.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, Willie B. fell asleep and never woke up.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was the most popular animal in the zoo, and known
across the country, Eaton says the outpouring from the public and
the attention from the media has been overwhelming. Saturday Zoo
Atlanta is holding a public tribute to Willie B. with free
admission to the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Willie B.'s remarkable journey will end where it began. His
ashes will be flown to Africa, and scattered in the forest where he
once ran free.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of flowers, the zoo requests that contributions be made
to the Willie B. Memorial Fund, 800 Cherokee Ave., Atlanta, GA
30315. The fund will support primate care and research at Zoo
Atlanta and in Africa.

`OTHERS' TOO SOFT BOILED TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE OTHERS 
Starring: Julianne Nicholson, Gabriel Macht, John Billingsley,
Melissa Crider, Bill Cobbs, Kevin J. O`Connor, John Aylward 
On: NBC 
Time: Saturday night at 10 
Rated: TV14 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who needs the Psychic Friends Network? Now we have the Others, a
quirky circle of psychics, mediums, and all-purpose sensitives who
will come directly to your home every week at no cost, except an
hour of your time. No ghost is too grumpy for this motley crew, no
white light too bright. And guess what. They're based in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Others'' is a new supernatural series that NBC is slotting
on Saturday nights at 10, after its two similarly creep-minded
shows, ``Profiler'' and ``The Pretender.'' It's a clear attempt to
borrow some of the paranormal heat from ``The Sixth Sense,'' the
hit movie whose name, I would bet, arose at more than one network
meeting for the show. But instead of the ``I see dead people''
approach, ``The Others'' takes the ensemble alternative: ``They see
dead people.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, I see dead potential. ``The Others'' is a show with a
promising premise and a very interesting collection of characters.
But it is also a show with a tragic dependency on feel-goodism and
sentimental resolutions. Horror and schmaltz? They just don't mix
well.
</P>
<P>
   In the premiere, college student Marian is being haunted by a
girl who died in her dorm room. After hearing of Marian's
experiences, the professor of folklore and mythology introduces her
to his exclusive club of extrasensory outsiders. They include two
attractive young members _ an empathic medical intern and a New Age
visionary _ as well as a blind man who ``sees,'' a mentally
off-kilter seer, and an elderly medium who is the gang's boldest
spiritual warrior.
</P>
<P>
   Together, these unlikely superheroes help make peace between the
spirit and the material worlds. Their speciality is hooking up with
ghosts who have unfinished business, the ones who can't go to their
eternal rest until they find closure. It's not too far from the
movie ``Ghost,'' except, of course, ``The Others'' is not a
romantic comedy.
</P>
<P>
   In between their casework adventures, the Others gather for
meetings. The noodgiest one seems to be the blind man, played by
John Aylward, who is annoyed when newcomer Marian has trouble
mixing with the gang. ``I, for one, do not appreciate being
condescended to by some cheerleader from Crib Death, Iowa,'' he
says. The sanest is Bill Cobbs's Elmer, the gentle mentor who likes
to drop ominous references to his own demise.
</P>
<P>
   With some careful guidance, ``The Others'' could produce
ghost-story chills in future episodes. But at this point the
writers seem to have a weakness for soft-boiled plots and
touchy-feely messages. In the end, the show is more like ``Touched
by an Angel'' than you might expect, or want.

PRIMAKOV DROPS OUT OF RUSSIAN PRESIDENTIAL RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov dropped out of
the presidential race Friday, deserting a field that is already
overwhelmingly dominated by Acting President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, 70, a senior statesman and leader of the foundering
centrist opposition, said in a television interview Friday that his
decision to withdraw from the March 26 elections was based on a
conclusion that Russia still had a long way to go before becoming a
civil society and a true democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Just six months ago, Primakov was a strong favorite to succeed
Russia's first president, Boris Yeltsin. But Putin, 47, who became
prime minister in August and was named acting president after
Yeltsin's surprise resignation on Dec. 31, has soared in the polls,
largely because of his tough stance on Russia's war in Chechnya but
also because of his relative youth and more energetic brand of
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of parliamentary elections last December, Primakov
tried to invigorate the chances of his Fatherland-All Russia party
by announcing his candidacy for president. But after a series of
relentless attacks on Kremlin-friendly television stations,
Primakov's party was left in the dust in the December elections,
just as the Putin bandwagon got rolling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not conceal the fact that this was a difficult
decision,'' said Primakov Friday, noting that he had received
thousands of letters of support. ``One would think that this would
have confirmed me in my decision. However, during the elections,
and as I began work in the parliament, I sense how far our society
is from being a civil society, and from a true democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think that this situation can change radically in a
few months.''
</P>
<P>
   On the opening day of the new parliament last month, a pro-Putin
party, known as Unity, allied itself with the opposition Communists
and took control of the parliament's top leadership positions. One
goal of the maneuver, analysts said, was to block Primakov from
being elected speaker, a post that would have given him national
exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Shoved onto the sidelines, Primakov joined Grigory Yavlinsky,
leader of the liberal democratic Yabloko party, and Sergei
Kiriyenko, who heads a right-wing party, in staging a walkout from
the parliament. They have since agreed to return on Feb. 9, but the
Kremlin's tactics seemed to stir the first rustling of a coalition
ready to stand up to Putin's Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   With Primakov's formal withdrawal Friday, Putin is left with two
major opponents in the coming elections: Yavlinsky and Gennadi
Zyuganov, leader of the Russian Communist Party. According to a
recent poll by a top Russian polling agency, Public Opinion, 52
percent supported Putin for president, 15 percent backed Zyuganov,
9 percent backed Primakov and 5 percent preferred Yavlinsky.
</P>
<P>
   As the war in Chechnya moves into a new phase, Putin's ratings
may be getting shaky. Another public opinion poll, by the Vtsiom
agency, show that his popularity had dropped seven points to 48
percent in just the last week.
</P>
<P>
   As the battle for Grozny, the Chechen capital, continues, the
Russian military has been more forthcoming with casualty figures,
which on Friday were given as as 1,290 dead and 3,970 wounded since
the start of military operations in the North Caucasus last August.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, Gen. Valery Manilov, deputy chief
of staff, said that a considerable part of the federal forces in
Chechnya will soon start to be withdrawn as the war moves into the
mountains where rebel leaders have made their bases.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 270. PLEASE
NOTE: THERE IS NO ATTENDANCE CHART WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 -- The
following chart shows how senators and representatives voted on key
bills and amendments within the last week. A ``Y'' means the member
voted for the measure; an ``N'' means the member voted against the
measure; a ``?'' means the member did not vote; and a ``P'' means
the member voted ``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: BANKRUPTCY
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday approved, 83-14, a bill that would
overhaul the bankruptcy system by making it more difficult for
people to erase their debts. The measure also raises the hourly
minimum wage by $1 to $6.15 over the next three years and slashes
various business taxes by $76 billion over ten years. The bill also
includes a provision that would prevent violent protesters at
abortion clinics from using bankruptcy laws to evade fines and
damages. Supporters said the bill is needed to prevent people who
can afford to pay off their debts from taking advantage of
loopholes in current law. Opponents, including President Clinton,
said some of the bankruptcy provisions were unfair and said the tax
cuts were too big. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

   1) BILL NUMBER: TAIWAN
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday approved, 341 to 70, a bill to strengthen
military ties with Taiwan. Supporters of the measure said it was
important to show support for Taiwan in light of China's military
build-up. Opponents, including President Clinton, said the bill
would exacerbate tensions between China and Taiwan. A ``yes'' vote
favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: LIABILITY
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 222-194, a bill to create an
18-year liability limit when manufacturing companies are sued by
employees injured by old equipment. Supporters said the bill
protects manufacturers from ``frivolous lawsuits.'' Opponents said
it was unfair to workers who could be left with no recourse if
injured by old equipment at their workplace. A ``yes'' vote favors
the bill.

has her work cut out for her when she launches her long-awaited New

YOU AND `THE OTHERS' ARE GETTING VERY SLEEPY . . . 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes, good acting can rescue a plodding script. But,
sometimes, a show needs help from beyond the sound stage.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the makers of ``The Others'' may not be as gifted
as the actors _ or the characters _ in their show. Absent any
assistance from the other side, ``The Others'' promises to be one
of the slowest-moving ``thrillers'' in the history of television.
Put another way: ``The Others'' makes glaciers look fast.
</P>
<P>
   An hour of ``The Others'' goes a long way toward filling up
one's day. So does half an hour. If only the producers _ a couple
of ``X-Files'' alums plus the guys who made the films ``The Game''
and ``The Net'' _ could tap into the spirit of a departed writer or
director who knows how to make exposition go a little faster, NBC
might have a Saturday night winner. Instead, based on two episodes
NBC provided for review, it has a Saturday night sleeping aid.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's premiere introduces us to a group of empaths,
psychics and mediums via Marian Kitt (Julianne Nicholson), who is
attending college in the Boston area. Marian possesses a certain
psychic power, something she's known about all her life but tried
to ignore. After encountering the ghost of a young woman who died
in her dorm room, though, she wigs out and comes to the attention
of Miles Ballard (John Billingsley), a professor of mythology and
folklore who possesses no special powers other than the uncanny
ability to be annoying in every scene he appears in.
</P>
<P>
   It is Ballard who introduces Marian to the Others, suggesting
that this group of gifted people might help her understand her own
gift more thoroughly. Among them are Satori (Melissa Crider), a New
Age channeler; Mark Gabriel (Gabriel Macht), a medical intern with
empathic abilities; Warren Day (Kevin J. O'Connor), an eccentric,
homeless psychic; Albert McGonnagal (John Aylward), a bad-tempered
psychiatrist whose blindness heightens his ``sixth sense,'' and
Elmer Greentree (Bill Cobbs), an octogenarian medium and de facto
mentor to the group.
</P>
<P>
   It seems the main mission of the Others is to get people to let
go of loved ones who have passed on but not quite passed over.
Saturday's apparition in the dorm is one such hanger-on. In another
episode, a woman has trouble accepting the death of her child and
husband.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Marian doesn't think she belongs, but it turns out her
psychic ability is the key to resolving the problem. Nicholson
effectively takes her character from skeptical naif to reluctantly
helpful spirit guide, and Cobbs is quite enjoyable as the savvy old
man of the group who thinks his time on this earth is growing
short.
</P>
<P>
   But too much nonsensical gibberish about the paranormal and too
obvious lines that mere mortals would never utter make ``The
Others'' a mostly dreary exercise in watching the clock to see how
soon it will be over.
</P>
<P>
   The Others. One-hour drama about a group of people with
extrasensory capabilities helping people not similarly gifted come
to terms with matters of the paranormal. Starring Julianne
Nicholson, Bill Cobbs, Melissa Crider, Gabriel Macht, Kevin J.
O'Connor, John Billingsley and John Aylward. Series premiere
Saturday night on NBC. Parental guideline rating: TV-14.

   NEW YORK _ It was snowing and sticking _ a meteorological event
that even die-hard Weather Channel fans didn't expect _ and it made
the atmosphere inside Il Buco seem like a ski lodge in the Italian
Alps, even if this was Bond Street on a Thursday night. The crowd
was loud, exuberant and well dressed, which made the place perfect
for the little woman with the big presence about to make her
entrance, a curvaceous blonde in a white Dr. Zhivago hat parting a
sea of skinny dark clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Shear, who wrote and is starring in ``Dirty Blonde'' at
the New York Theater Workshop in the East Village, had come to eat
rigatoni con carciofi and share a bottle of red wine with some old
friends. She had spent the evening playing the sex goddess Mae West
_ the original ``too much of a good thing is wonderful'' girl.
</P>
<P>
   At dinner, a sort of second act to her intermission-less play,
Shear and her cronies displayed a Mae West-worthy appetite for
life, gobbling equal portions of sexual gossip, pop culture and
Mediterranean food. The conversation smacked less of Diamond Lil
camp than the posttherapy boldness of ``Sex and the City.'' Except
they actually swallowed the food.
</P>
<P>
   Shear's friends are the kind of eclectic group one would expect.
After all, she is the woman whose previous play, the Obie
Award-winning comedy ``Blown Sideways Through Life,'' recounted the
dozens of disparate jobs _ a phone operator in a brothel among them
_ that she has held. Shear was flanked by Zandy Forbes, an
Englishwoman in blue nail polish who studies genetics at New York
University Medical Center, and Zoe Heller, a newspaper columnist
whose new novel is ``Everything You Know.'' Rounding out the table
was John Lyons, a film producer whose credits include ``Boogie
Nights'' and ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons was back from the Sundance Film Festival, where he said he
sold a movie, ``The Opportunist,'' starring Christopher Walken and
Cyndi Lauper, in which Shear has what she calls ``a small
humiliating scene as a secretary.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons recounted the moment that summed up his Sundance
experience. ``RuPaul and Tammy Faye Bakker were sitting in the
Starbucks on Main Street,'' he said. ``I love a world in which
that's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   As the pasta arrived, the discussion careened from star
encounters (``Oh my God, I got a note from Stephen Sondheim!''
Shear exclaimed) to the osso buco at Babbo (``It's like Fred
Flintstone!'').
</P>
<P>
   Besides fame and food, the group's shared passion is a blend of
yoga, dance and stretching called the Lotte Berk Method. While
willing to suffer to look good is a priority, all expressed unease
concerning the character-erasing trade-off of plastic surgery.
During the night, they debated who is straight in Hollywood, and
what is great in fashion. Shear was wearing a midnight blue ruffled
shirt from Isaac Mizrahi and black Gucci trousers that she had
dieted to get into. She lifted her leg over her head to show off
the boots she bought to celebrate the reviews of ``Dirty Blonde'' _
black knee boots with a Sabrina heel by Jimmy Choo. Mae West would
have approved.
</P>
<P>
   West's preferred mode of transportation was a specially
outfitted stretch limousine. ``She had pink light bulbs in her
limo,'' Shear said. But there was no luxury vehicle waiting to take
her home after dinner. At 1 a.m., she traversed a pile of snow in
those Jimmy Choo boots to catch a cab to her apartment in
Williamsburg, Brooklyn, a neighborhood she loves. ``I once saw a
T-shirt that said London, Paris, Rome, Brooklyn,'' she said.
``That's me.'' &QL;

ANALYZING AIR TRAGEDY NOT A HAT JOHN NANCE WEARS WELL  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There he was on television again in the aftermath of an airplane
crash _ John J. Nance of Tacoma, calm, authoritative, cautionary, a
voice from the cockpit trying to make sense of what might have
happened and why.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, it was all different for the pilot who serves as
aviation editor and analyst for ABC News. This week, the plane that
went down was from Alaska Airlines where Nance himself has long
flown (although he is on leave for three years).
</P>
<P>
   ``This crash has been terrifying for me in many respects,''
Nance conceded in an interview. ``First, I would love to just hide
and not do analysis of it. But my ABC position dictates that I have
to be there. Secondly, I have always prided myself on not
identifying myself as an Alaska pilot, because I didn't think it
was appropriate _ I always needed to be a million miles from a
particular carrier when I'm on the air commenting on what a pilot
may have done.
</P>
<P>
   ``So with Alaska 261, suddenly my neutrality was gone and I was
biased as hell and that made this week's tragedy a special horror.
I had to break my silence immediately about my Alaska connection,
telling viewers on every show that I am not a neutral party in this
crash and everything I say should be taken with that in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The Alaska crash also occurred during what should have been a
time of celebration for the 53-year-old pilot. For it came within
days of publication of his latest novel which should have been
prompting thoughts of another run on the best-seller lists, after
``Pandora's Clock,'' ``Medusa's Child'' and ``The Last Hostage.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Nance's media interviews for ``Blackout'' (G.P.
Putnam, 435 pages, $23.95) _ another gut-pounding airborne thriller
_ were interrupted by constant calls from ABC and other media
seeking comments on the latest developments in the Alaska 261
crash. The swamped Nance obliged as best he could, even if only ABC
was paying for his comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notoriety certainly never hurt my books,'' Nance said,
``but I've always felt, rightly or wrongly, that I was
accomplishing something by offering my observations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Blackout'' itself has a higher purpose, even if it is such a
diverting entertainment that it turns page turning into an aerobic
workout. The plot centers on the use of anti-personnel lasers to
blind pilots and send airliners plummeting from the skies.
</P>
<P>
   These portable lasers seem to have fallen into the hands of
terrorists in Nance's novel, causing two crashes. Or they may have
fallen into the hands of renegade forces within the United States
government, as FBI agent Katherine Bronsky begins to suspect.
</P>
<P>
   This plot might seem to have sprung from ``The X-Files'' rather
than a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserve and veteran
of both the Vietnam and Gulf wars, as Nance is. He is that adamant
about the laser threat.
</P>
<P>
   As he emphasized, ``I have been very, very interested _ and
terrified _ that one of these days we have to face the reality of
anti-personnel lasers. I want to keep ahead of the game, since one
of tomorrow's headlines is likely to be about an air crew severely
hurt by a laser. I think that _ if they are not outlawed or
severely controlled _ then it is only a matter of time until
somebody pulls this.''
</P>
<P>
   Nance is a driven person who relishes ``pushing the envelope''
by performing many disparate roles well: Husband and father of
three. Pilot. Aviation attorney. Motivational speaker. Best-selling
author. Analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Facts, figures and data flow forth from his brain at a sonic
clip: The 31 speeches he gives a year, usually to medical groups.
The 62 appearances he had on network shows in the five days
following the crash of a USAir plane in Pittsburgh, which left him
feeling ``as though it came out of my hide'' and convinced him to
sign a contract with ABC. The extra 60 knots of speed that an
experienced captain had ordered as a plane approached Denver after
a thunderstorm, extra speed that Nance, engineer on the flight,
remains convinced kept the plane from crashing when it encountered
wind shear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still hit the ground so hard we thought we had damaged the
struts,'' Nance related, ``The passengers filed off that plane
without a word; we came off white as ghosts.''
</P>
<P>
   Nance may be associated with airplane crashes, but his own
career in the cockpit has seen few crises. Besides the Denver wind
shear, his greatest challenge came last year in his company plane
on a book tour through the South. An electrical fire sent a plume
of smoke into the cockpit and the right windshield shattered,
causing Nance to cut electrical power and divert to the nearest
airfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to declare an emergency for the first time in an
airplane,'' he recalled. ``We were able to land in 4{ minutes in
Anderson, S.C., and it turned out that some idiot had failed to
tighten a power connection during maintenance, causing the fire. It
nearly killed us. If I didn't have a lot of pilot time, I could
have blown my approach because of nerves. That's what happens to
many private pilots.''
</P>
<P>
   The rare crisis that Nance has faced in the cockpit, despite
13,000 hours of commercial and military flight, may be one of the
reasons why he is the voice of caution _ or even optimism _ in the
aftermath of a crash. In fact, Nance is sometimes chided by Charles
Gibson of ``Good Morning America'' for so frequently insisting
``how good aviation is, how safe it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Nance is willing to plead guilty (somewhat) as charged: ``It's
not that I think pilots are god and aviation is perfect. But we
have built a very good system. I do not want to be a
commercial-monger for the airlines, but I do believe this is an
industry in which the public can have faith. The level of safety
and certainty is incredibly high, despite all the galvanized
concern when someone goes down.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been 15 years since Nance first started making media
appearances for his first book on Braniff Airlines, where he had
been a pilot. There have been 10 books and probably 2,000 media
appearances since.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Nance has achieved prominence as both a best-selling author
and aviation analyst (``expert'' is a description he despises).
People finally are recognizing that the guy who writes the
thrillers is the same guy who appears on television.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, being a writer means the most to Nance, more than
any of his other roles. As he stressed, ``Writing has always been a
great fascination of mine because you can be someone who leaves
behind books and they will outlive you. Tens of thousands of people
can fly airplanes as well as I can, but there is unique creativity
involved in writing a book.''

WOODRUFF'S LOSS PUTS U.S. IN DANGER OF DAVIS CUP DEFEAT BY
ZIMBABWE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ It was never easy being John McEnroe on a
tennis court but Friday he found out that living through someone
else can be much worse.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe's featured marionette, Chris Woodruff, was not light
enough on strings, and couldn't carry the muse from arguably the
most intuitive player of all time. McEnroe's first day on the
sideline as captain for the U.S. Davis Cup team was nothing he
shouldn't have expected but everything he feared.
</P>
<P>
   Woodruff was overwhelmed by altitude, pressure, a steady
drumbeat, a clown's hex and, most of all, by Zimbabwe's Byron
Black. The 7-6 (7-2), 6-3, 6-2 demolition of the tall stand-in from
Tennessee was worse than it looked because, while falling apart
after losing a first-set tiebreaker, Woodruff persuaded no one of
his ability to rescue a potential decisive fifth match on Saturday
against Byron's brother, Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win the doubles, we'll be the overwhelming favorites
again,'' McEnroe said. ``If not, Chris and I will put out heads
together to figure out a way for him to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The much safer route to the second round would be a doubles
victory Saturday by Alex O'Brien and Rick Leach (who have never
played together) against Wayne Black and Kevin Ullyett. Then Andre
Agassi, who fought off the scrappy Wayne Black, 7-5, 6-3, 7-5, in
Friday's first match, could spare Woodruff the potential nightmare
which awaits him Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe wasn't about to call these the craziest Davis Cup
conditions he's ever experienced because, by South American
standards, they were practically mild. There were a couple of dozen
chanting and dancing fans, the aforementioned drums and clown, but
the remainder of the Zimbabwean audience was mostly tame, not to
mention largely white.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that Woodruff, at 27, had never played Davis Cup
before, and while he denied being scared, he was stylistically
stiff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walked into a very difficult situation,'' said McEnroe, who
summoned Woodruff last Friday, the day he was departing New York,
after injury and illness deleted Pete Sampras and Todd Martin, and
after McEnroe was rebuffed by Michael Chang. ``These are not
conditions that are conducive to Chris' style of play.''
</P>
<P>
   In his debut as champion of the conversational changeover,
McEnroe was obviously deflecting criticism of his player, and being
downright kind. Besides, he was always much better at blaming
umpires, and ultimately himself.
</P>
<P>
   Here at the Harare Sports Center, McEnroe had the opportunity to
balance that formula, when he said that a long and contentious
relationship with the Australian umpire, Wayne McKewen, had
contributed to Woodruff's pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been one of the worst umpires and continued to be
today,'' McEnroe said. ``There were some clear mistakes and we
didn't get the calls. I feel bad for Chris because it's like I feel
in some ways the guy is paying me back. Somehow, I sense it's
personal, and I feel bad for people that have to play for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The counterpoints begin with a call by Bruno Rebeuh for Agassi
and against Wayne Black on what appeared to be a long Agassi
forehand on set point in the first set. By the third set, so
disgusted was the man called Shumba (lion) by the chanting African
fans, that he repeatedly slashed his racquet against the hard
court.
</P>
<P>
   The more significant issue is that McEnroe is making the
emotional and awkward adjustment from ``someone who's played, and
has always been playing.'' When he said, ``I don't give myself a
very good grade either,'' he couldn't follow up with reasons why.
</P>
<P>
   His parents noticed his edginess from the stands, behind the
bench. ``My wife and I were watching and she said, `Look at him, he
keeps turning around to talk to someone,''' John McEnroe Sr. said.
``She said, `He just can't stand to just sit there.'''
</P>
<P>
   With Woodruff, at least, he kept looking for internal answers
that just weren't there. No matter what McEnroe planned, said or
did, the volley down at the shoelaces has to be guided across the
net by someone else. Someone who showed little feel for the
creative point, or the mid-match tinkering when things go awry.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing one of those nose strips for breathing, Woodruff looked
like a boxer whose face had been cut before round one. He didn't
show soft hands and his 6 foot 4 inch body could not match the
quickness and elasticity of the 5-10 Black (Chidembo, or cat, to
the chanters).
</P>
<P>
   Woodruff played a fairly tight first set, and had two break
points for a 5-3 lead. Black saved one with a backhand crosscourt
pass, and the second when Woodruff's service return went long. This
was the call McEnroe was most agitated about later, though, at the
time, his appeal was momentary and tame.
</P>
<P>
   Once Black had won the first set tiebreaker, handily, the fans
knew they were onto a competitive event. The clown playfully cast
his voodoo on Woodruff, Dancing Harry style. Woodruff continued
flailing away at balls that were being carried long in the light,
nearly mile-high air.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, I started out a little nervous but I
really didn't feel intimidated out there,'' Woodruff said.
</P>
<P>
   Tell it to the judge. Black, who never lost his serve, broke
Woodruff in the second game of the second set and again in the
third game of the third. McEnroe at this point removed his red,
white and blue team sweatshirt. Was it getting too hot or was
considering putting himself in?
</P>
<P>
   It was too late to save this day. Soon, Woodruff was coughing up
his serve at love, for 2-5 in the third. Frustrated by another line
call, he sprayed water on the court and groused about in a manner
McEnroe, of all people, found familiar.
</P>
<P>
   After Black served out the match, the more raucous fans, clown
included, raced onto the court, only to be driven off by guards.
Somewhere, not at courtside, Agassi had to be wondering if he had
come all the way here to ultimately lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing you can really say beyond reassuring him of
what he does best,'' the world's No. 1 player had said earlier when
asked how he could help Woodruff. ``He's going to take another step
in his career.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodruff took a step, all right. He went backward. By Sunday,
McEnroe may have to teach him how to walk and win the most
pressurized match of all.

UNTIL LETTERMAN'S RETURN, GUEST HOSTS MAY BE USED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Letterman is recuperating so quickly from recent
heart-bypass surgery that he might return to his duties as host of
``The Late Show'' in a couple of weeks. But if he's not ready by
then, the program might resort, for the first time in its history,
to using guest hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late Show'' executive producer Rob Burnett said Friday that
``Dave is absolutely not opposed to guest hosts, nor am I'' _
though he added that the subject has not yet been discussed in
detail.
</P>
<P>
   What is known for sure is that next week's package of reruns
will contain a new twist: Celebrities will appear in newly taped
segments that are interwoven with clips from the old shows on which
they were guests. Julia Roberts and Regis Philbin will appear
Monday, Jerry Seinfeld and Danny DeVito on Tuesday, Bruce Willis on
Wednesday, Bill Cosby and Sarah Jessica Parker on Thursday, and
Steve Martin on Friday, with Billy Crystal a maybe.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with TV writers, Burnett said it took only
``one quick phone call'' to book the guests, who said ``they'd love
to do this for Dave.'' He added jokingly: ``If only the regular
show were this easy to book.'' Several of the celebrities have also
offered to fill in as guest hosts for Letterman, according to
Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   Handling the interviews for the new segments, which will be 10
to 15 minutes each, will be the omnipresent Philbin, actor Charles
Grodin, and ``Late Show'' music director Paul Shaffer. The segments
will feature the celebs discussing their favorite moments on the
program, and will have the irreverent tone that is the hallmark of
Letterman's show. ``They make fun of Dave, make fun of the show,''
Burnett said. ``Dave has not passed on. This is not the thing where
everyone sits and talks about how great Dave is.''
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old Letterman underwent emergency bypass surgery on
Jan. 14 after an angiogram revealed severe blockage in one of his
arteries. There has been speculation that he might return on Feb.
14, though Burnett was playing down that speculation Friday. ``The
14th we're not ruling out, but I think it's being overstated,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Letterman does resume his late-night show, he is likely
to draw a huge audience. February is one of several crucial ratings
``sweeps'' periods, and CBS would dearly like to capitalize this
month on the publicity that would attend Letterman's return.
</P>
<P>
   He has rebounded quickly, making an appearance at the ``Late
Show'' offices on Monday and walking 3 miles on Thursday, according
to Burnett. ``What he told me was that if he had a regular job,
he'd be back already,'' Burnett said.
</P>
<P>
   The producer said it's possible Letterman might return to work
gradually, hosting a couple of shows per week until he's back in
top form.

GOVERNOR, WHERE ARE YOU? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, February 6, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Massachusetts enjoys a number of blessings. We have the finest
medical facilities in the world.
</P>
<P>
   And we have two lieutenant governors. No other state can make
either claim. Our hospitals, medical schools and research outfits
are beyond compare. But the bankruptcy of Harvard Pilgrim, and the
threatened collapse of the medical insurance structure for
one-fifth of the citizenry, underscores the impotence of the
lieutenant governor who became governor. Paul Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   On his watch, the health care system is tottering, the hospitals
are going broke, a $300 million hole has opened with no obvious
replacement money in sight, and he is AWOL from the debate. Not a
factor. In the place of our perennially-campaigning governor, who
seems blissfully unaware of the fact that he (itals)won(unitals)
the office and now has a job to do, Atty. Gen. Tom Reilly has
emerged like the 7th Cavalry coming over the hill.
</P>
<P>
   Just one year into office, elected as a grim crime-fighter with
a hard edge toward wrong-doing, Reilly has stepped up to the
complex challenge of rescuing a system that is collapsing on
itself. While Reilly acted swiftly and adroitly to stabilize the
health care delivery for Harvard Pilgrim subscribers, Cellucci was
off in the political ozone.
</P>
<P>
   He spent much of the past week in New Hampshire, campaigning for
Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Lashing his payroll appointees to fly
north and hold signs at Bush rallies, Cellucci got as close to Bush
as possible, considering the way the Texas Ranger security detail
sealed Bush off from the Great Unwashed.
</P>
<P>
   When he's not raising money for himself -- a virtual daily
activity -- or for Bush, Cellucci is masterminding a tax rollback
initiative petition. With his tax-phobic ally, Barbara Anderson,
Cellucci is putting all his political muscle into a referendum
drive to roll back the state income tax by a shade under one
percent. This would give the average family of four $1.64 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci learned his cheerleading for tax cuts from Bill Weld
and George Bush The Elder. The fact that George IInd got clobbered
in New Hampshire last week while advocating massive and
irresponsible tax cuts for the nation appears not to have made an
impact on the Cellucci braincells.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the sudden appearance of another $1.4 billion overrun
in the Big Dig's Big Bill cause Brother Cellucci any concern. Gov.
Elsewhere merely shrugs. Hey, the Legislature will find the money
somewhere. Maybe raise the tolls again on the Turnpike and tunnels
and bridges, hey? Don't bother me; I'm helping Barbara Anderson get
signatures for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The gubernatorial amnesia is breath-taking. ``The Big Dig is ON
TIME and ON BUDGET,'' Cellucci brayed daily during his last
election campaign. Bull. The feds say the hole is $1.4 billion, and
State House whisperers say the gap between what's available to pay
it and what the taxpayers will have to come up with is closer to $2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   We all remember the Cellucci campaign propaganda, tearing down
tollbooths, bragging about lowering the cost of government. It was
a crock. An election-year gimmick to gull the voters and put one
over on the gullible. He wants to give the average family a tax
break of $1.64 a day? While he's raising your bridge, tunnel and
'pike tolls? Can he add?
</P>
<P>
   Let me return for a minute to health care. Once this crisis is
solved, it will mean higher premiums for you workers, and for you
bosses. Everyone will pay more. Cellucci's insurance commissioner
was out to lunch while this crisis built. The governor's staff was
figuring out how to run more cocktail parties for the
Bush-for-president gang, and not paying attention to business.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci has padded the state payroll with a trainload of hacks
who emerge from the coffee shops and bars to go campaigning in New
Hampshire, or yank signatures for tax cut petitions. Cellucci has
failed to deliver on any major initiative since elected in his own
right.
</P>
<P>
   He muffed the drive for a new Logan airport runway. The new
runway is necessary and will eventually be built. But allowing his
political people to mount a stupid assault on US Rep. Joe Moakley
was a hugely dumb move. Blaming the other Democrats in the
delegation for not getting more money for the Big Dig was a typical
Cellucci stunt, a shortsighted political dodge made with no
recognition of the longer-term damage it did to his cause.
</P>
<P>
   Tangling with Mayor Tom Menino and legislative leaders over
every point of contention has resulted in the marginalization of
the governor's office, normally the fulcrum of political power in
this state. Weld must be rolling his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   This is the tenth year of gorging at the trough by the
Weld-Cellucci crowd. A lot of the talented people have moved on,
like Weld; those with connections have gone lobbying, for vast
sums; and those who remain are not varsity material. Lt. Gov.
Swift's inelegant manuevers around her helicoptering to family
meals at taxpayer expense and dragooning state employees into
babysitting symbolizes the excesses and sense of entitlement that
accrue to political profiteers who have stayed too long.
</P>
<P>
   When Cellucci needed a new Port Authority chief to plug a hole,
he grabbed his press secretary, a woman with zero experience in the
field, whose first move was to carve out a $30,000 raise for
herself. With a bench like this, is it any wonder that the State
Insurance Commission was asleep while Harvard Pilgrim hit the
iceberg?
</P>
<P>
   It will be up to the Legislature and Reilly to salvage the
health insurance debacle. Cellucci will read about it in the paper,
as he looks up the weather in Florida and the sixth race at
Suffolk. Reilly has a chance to emerge as the state's best problem
solver out of this -- and that could make him the next governor, in
a state that badly needs a real one.

   AUSTRIA-POLITICS (Vienna) _ Austria's new coalition of
conservatives and Joerg Haider's far-right Freedom Party took
office Friday and the United States said it was recalling its
ambassador for consultations. Austria's 14 European Union partners

shot, burned alive or tied to cars and dragged to death. The

Bush's defeat in the New Hampshire primary, he arrived in South
Carolina with a broad smile on his face, nary a trace of tension in
his shoulders and a robust arsenal of optimistic metaphors.
``There's bumps in the road,'' Bush said at a news conference in
Greenville, S.C., on Wednesday. But, he added, what lay ahead was
``a long, smooth highway.'' Neither his voice nor his words
reflected the heap of trouble he was in. That held true when the
Texas governor later chatted with reporters and saw fit to mention
that while he wanted the presidency, he was both grounded and
rounded enough to move on with his life if he did not get it. By

looking for work and easing the struggle to make ends meet. Wall
Street saw the January employment numbers _ 387,000 new jobs, the
biggest increase since September 1997, and an unemployment rate
that ticked down to 4 percent, the lowest level in 30 years _ as
fresh evidence of a rising inflation rate, if not right away, then

United States continue reducing their massive strategic nuclear
arsenals _ from 4,700 each in 1992 to between 2,000 and 2,500 in
1998 _ the Kremlin's Security Council has approved a disturbing

<P>
   The list of Republican presidential hopefuls, which started out
with 10, is down to four. Gary Bauer dropped out of the race
Friday, saying his first presidential campaign ``just didn't
work.'' Bauer had steered the other GOP candidates toward
conservative issues, and said he leaves feeling ``good about how
I've moved the debate.'' But he barely registered with voters,
drawing just 1 percent in New Hampshire, coming in last. So far, he
has declined to endorse any remaining candidates.
</P>
<P>
   PATAKI THROWS IN THE TOWEL
</P>
<P>
   With New York Gov. George Pataki conceding that John McCain
should appear on all the state's GOP ballots, settlement of
McCain's lawsuit seems assured. Federal Judge Edward Korman is
expected to rule that none of the candidates will have to gather
signatures of party members to qualify their delegate slates, as is
now required. Pataki, who's supporting George W. Bush, was trying
to use the state party's arcane primary rules to keep McCain off
the ballot in 12 of the state's 31 congressional districts. The New
York primary is March 7.
</P>
<P>
   WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE?
</P>
<P>
   It's a plastic world, in which Visa, MasterCard and Discover are
accepted, no matter how small the donation. In the few days since
his resounding triumph in New Hampshire on Tuesday, John McCain has
mentioned his campaign's Web address in nearly every nationally
televised interview he has done, and has pulled in more than $1
million. Even more surprising, his campaign officials say, 40
percent of the donations came from first-time political givers and
34 percent of the contributors are under age 40.
</P>
<P>
   EMPHASIS ON DIFFERENCES
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Bill Bradley, campaigning at the University of
Maryland, accused rival Al Gore of waging a ``relentlessly
negative'' campaign, but said they both would have to focus on
sharpening their differences as their race goes national. ``This is
a campaign not only about me; it's a campaign about him,'' Bradley
said. ``It's a campaign about differences.'' Bradley plans a rest
day Saturday. Gore is off the campaign trail Friday and will only
attend a theater event in Nashville, Tenn., on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   TRYING TO BE THE REAL REFORMER
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, after appearing at a charter school in Detroit
on Friday, stepped up his criticism of John McCain as a Washington
insider, questioning how his GOP rival could promote campaign
reform while accepting donations from lobbyists and flights on
corporate jets. Bush said he would not let the ``Washington
double-talk'' continue. ``I'm the person who's been the reformer,''
Bush said. ``It's hard to be a reformer if you've spent your entire
career in Washington, D.C., which he (McCain) has done.''
</P>
<P>
   FIRING UP THE CROWD, FOR REAL
</P>
<P>
   Crowds overwhelmed a fire station in Georgetown, S.C., to hear
John McCain give an evening campaign speech. But a fire call
interrupted McCain's address, forcing the audience to scatter to
free up a hook and ladder truck.
</P>
<P>
   DEBATING WHEN TO DEBATE
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore rejected Bill Bradley's suggestion to start weekly
debates Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' Douglas Hattaway, a
Gore spokesman, said the schedule should be negotiated. ``He can't
unilaterally dictate a schedule when we've had this challenge
outstanding for a long time,'' Hattaway said, referring to a Gore
offer of twice-weekly debates. But Eric Hauser, Bradley's
spokesman, said, ``Given the vice president's interest in debating,
we find this surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   AND HE ALREADY KNOWS
</P>
<P>
   Asked to defend the administration's spotty record of working
with Congress, Al Gore suggested that his resume makes him better
prepared for the White House than Bill Clinton was in 1992. Gore
noted his 16 years in the House and Senate and suggested he would
bring more experience than Clinton did in 1993 when he went
straight from Little Rock to the White House. ``I have experience
in both chambers and long-standing friendships and personal
relationships on both sides of the aisle in both the House and the
Senate,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   NOW HEAR THIS _ ALL HANDS ON DECK
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's campaign has put out a ``call to arms'' appeal
to supporters in advance of Tuesday's Delaware primary. ``If you're
feeling left out of this year's presidential primary season, here's
your chance to get involved,'' says an e-mail sent by Maria Cino,
Bush's political director. Cino said Bush is ``looking for hearty
politicos to slush through the snow ... this coming weekend.'' John
McCain, the New Hampshire winner, is not competing in Delaware, but
Steve Forbes is hoping to ambush Bush there.
</P>
<P>
   GRUMPY (NOT SO) OLD MAN
</P>
<P>
   The wear and tear of the campaign trail is showing, and the
candidates are getting cranky. Bill Bradley, hair disheveled and
tie askew, gazed around a frigid airliner the other day as
reporters and campaign staffers huddled under coats and blankets
seeking warmth and sleep before yet another dead-of-the-night
landing. ``I'll speak to someone,'' he said. Learning that dinner
would once more be cold drew an expletive about the lack of a ``...
oven.'' Bradley is scheduled to take a day off over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A TEST FOR VIETNAM ATTITUDES
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam War hero John McCain is generating notice and support
from much of the antiwar generation that 35 years ago scorned the
military as war criminals. Americans may still disagree over the
cause, the meaning and the consequences of the war. But voters and
activists alike seem to find in McCain's presidential bid a reason
to acknowledge that there was honor, and enduring value, in his
wartime record as a Navy pilot and POW. Some antiwar political
activists, according to Newhouse News Services, have tagged McCain
as a potential ally who won't be afraid to stand up to the
Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   COMING SOON TO YOUR LIVING ROOM
</P>
<P>
   The presidential campaign is shifting from town halls to
television sets as candidates trade the personal campaigning of
Iowa and New Hampshire for a multistate advertising blitz. During
the next month, candidates must woo voters in nearly two dozen
states _ including large and delegate-rich California and New York
_ forcing them to rely more on pricey 30-second spots than
handshakes. ``We have now moved away from retail campaigning. The
candidates have got to rely on the mass media,'' said Kathleen
Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the
University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   THE WEB, AND HOW TO USE IT
</P>
<P>
   A University of Pennsylvania check of campaign Web sites after
New Hampshire found most of them slow to be updated and used to
spin the results. John McCain's was not updated until the morning
after Tuesday night's huge win over George W. Bush. By 10 p.m.
Tuesday on Bush's site, every mention of New Hampshire had been
replaced with information about the next battleground, South
Carolina. Third-place finisher Steve Forbes spun the results with
this: ``With George W. Bush's loss to John McCain ... the race for
Republican nomination is now wide open.'' Democrat Bill Bradley
took a similar approach, pitching the race ahead to the upcoming
``national campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT DID DELLA WEAR?
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, trying to repeat his Delaware victory of four
years ago, talked a lot about George W. Bush's second-place finish
in New Hampshire and saw renewed hope for himself. ``There's
nothing inevitable now,'' Forbes said. John McCain is skipping
Tuesday's Delaware primary, as he did the Iowa caucuses last month.
But Bush was in Delaware, making his third visit there and saying
you won't see him skipping any states.
</P>
<P>
   BIG INTEREST IN THE HORSE RACE
</P>
<P>
   A study of major media outlets over two weeks leading up to Iowa
and New Hampshire concluded that a large part of the news produced
was of little relevance to potential voters. The Project for
Excellence in Journalism, a journalist-run media watchdog group,
deemed the coverage to be heavy on political tactics and light on
policy and the candidates' backgrounds. The study concluded that 13
percent of the stories were about subjects that actually would
affect the public if any of the candidates were elected president _
such as their ideas, their honesty or how their constituents have
fared in the past.
</P>
<P>
   PARTY GIRL, TIMES 600
</P>
<P>
   As many as 25,000 New Yorkers are expected to turn out Sunday
for Hillary Rodham Clinton's official announcement that she's
running for the Senate. They won't all be in the same place,
however. Clinton will be at a state university campus near her new
Chappaqua home, but her campaign has asked local supporters to
throw house parties Sunday afternoon. ABC reports there will be
more than 600 of them around the state, each one expected to raise
around $1,000.

 &HT;    NORTH CAROLINA DELEGATES HAPPY WITH CLINTON AID REQUEST
 &HT;    Attn N.C. points.
 &HT;    By GINGER LIVINGSTON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Eastern North Carolina's congressional delegation
praised President Clinton's request for additional Hurricane Floyd
aid, but said Friday that more money is needed to fully revitalize
the region.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration announced Thursday it is including a
$304 million aid package in a supplemental fiscal 2000 spending
request being sent to Congress on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the $304 million package will raise the total
amount of hurricane and flood aid provided for North Carolina and
other states since last November to $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really meeting our unmet needs that are still
relief-related,'' said Rep. Eva Clayton, D-N.C. But she said more
money is needed in later budgets to renew eastern North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the new money, $128 million, will be used for housing
buyouts and Small Business Administration loans. The administration
is also requesting $131 million in farm aid and debt forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our farmers are in bad shape and any additional help is
welcomed,'' said Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C. ``We are going to need
much more than this, but we're definitely glad the administration
is working with the Senate leadership to fund this relief aid.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration wants $50 million in budgeted Emergency
Conservation Program money to repair farm structures and equipment
damaged during the hurricane and subsequent flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also asking that up to $81 million in U.S. Department
of Agriculture commodity price-support loans made to producer-owned
marketing associations be forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   These associations had pre-purchased the crops of its members,
crops which were either destroyed or heavily damaged. Since the
crops can't be sold at the purchase price, the farmers will have to
repay the loan money unless Congress agrees to forgive the debt.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the farm aid and housing buyout money, the Clinton
package includes money for beach renourishment, economic
development planning and restoring stream monitoring equipment and
repairing National Park Service property.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton said this money is especially needed since North
Carolina's recovery efforts are focusing on housing and farm aid.
</P>
<P>
   Jones predicts this relief proposal will be tied to a request
for additional funding for U.S. operations in Kosovo. Jones said he
hopes to debate the merit of supplying foreign aid to Kosovo when
North Carolina and so many other states need disaster aid.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Etheridge, D-N.C., said the state's delegation must
work hard to secure adoption of the president's request.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's now up to the congressional leadership to work with us to
fine-tune the administration's request to pass a fair disaster
relief bill for the victims of Hurricane Floyd,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he has been assured by Rep. Charles Taylor, R-N.C.,
who chaired a congressional committee on disaster relief, that the
House leadership wants to approve additional disaster relief.

   NY-BARTENDER-CONTEST (New York) _ The pour and speed tests for
bartenders are compulsory events in the Legends of Bartending
tournament. They're designed to keep it in the hands of
professional bartenders, and away from some Cirque du Soleil
interloper. The speed test calls for six drinks, everything from

   NY-HAIRDRESSER (New York) _ When I was a girl my mother used to
warn, ``If you don't study and get good grades, you'll wind up in
beauty school.'' I did study hard and graduated from an Ivy League
college, followed by an MA in art history. But last summer I found
myself bent over a black sink, a nozzle in one hand and a bottle of

perfect for the little woman with the big presence about to make

parting a sea of skinny dark clothes. Claudia Shear, who wrote and

   DANGELO-VOODOO-ALBUM (New York) _ On a recent sub-Arctic Tuesday

sweaty, with decor and soul music out of a 1970s time warp:

   BIG-WOMEN-LINGERIE (New York) _ Perhaps it was a slow news night

Superstudio in Manhattan Tuesday evening for the Lane Bryant runway
show of intimate apparel. A publicist muttered to me: ``Whoever
thought they'd turn out like this to see the big gals.'' Oh,
really. I am a big gal, and I was there to get some inspiration. I
had recently lost some weight and bought a new wardrobe, and a guy
had re-entered my life. (Standard story: old boyfriend, 22 years

   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ In England, where violets grow so
willingly that gardeners can afford to be snooty about varieties,
dog violets are about as welcome as curs at an American Kennel Club
show. I suppose if I could cultivate lush beds of English sweet
violets, Corsican violets and other scented and refined members of
the genus, I'd turn up my nose at dog violets, too. But I can't, so
I don't. I like my dog violets. By Cass Peterson.

   FEDBUD-DEBT _ WASHINGTON _ Not so long ago, it seemed hard to
imagine how this country would pay off the federal debt. When
President Clinton submits his budget to Congress on Feb. 7, though,
it will contain a plan for paying off the publicly held portion of
that debt _ some $3.3 trillion _ by 2013. That, says Clinton, would
be a stunning achievement that would dramatically change the
country's economic landscape for a generation to come. How,
precisely, would the plan work? Who would get paid, where would the
money come from and what impact would it have on the economy? And
why do some economists _ and some Republicans _ say that paying off
the debt might not be wise? (Deans, Cox News Service).

addition, he's moving into a $2 million D.C. residence with his

   SCHOOL-FUND _ Several members of the State Board of Education
say their financial expertise is limited to balancing their
checkbooks, choosing retirement plans and maybe selecting a mutual
fund. The members with the most money-management skills are David
Bradley, R-Beaumont, a licensed insurance, securities and real
estate agent, and Will Davis, D-Austin, a lawyer who represents
insurance companies. Yet the nine members of the board are
responsible for investment decisions on the $22 billion school
trust fund. It's been that way since 1845, and some lawmakers and
investment professionals say it's time to change that. None of the
state's other major pension and investment funds rely on elected
managers without expertise in investments. (Brooks, Austin

`WHEN BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO OTHER PEOPLE': WICKED THRILLS OF
MISFORTUNE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine an audience excitedly filling a theater to see a
``sublime and affecting tragedy.'' Then, suggests the 18th-century
philosopher Edmund Burke, imagine that just as everybody is finally
seated, an announcement is made that in an adjoining square a
``state criminal of high rank'' is about to be publicly executed.
In an instant, Burke suggests, the theater would be emptied,
proving just how paltry the pleasures of staged tragedy are
compared with the delight that can be taken in the ``real
misfortunes and pains of others.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, those delights might be attributed to the pleasure
of seeing justice done and society avenged. But that would be just
the alibi for a far more vulgar truth: there is delight just in
observing misfortune. There are pleasures to be had even if the
suffering is unjustified and even if the victim is an amiable
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the adversities of our best friends,'' wrote La
Rochefoucauld, ``we always find something which is not displeasing
to us.'' Or as Gore Vidal conversely put it, ``Whenever a friend
succeeds, a little something in me dies.''
</P>
<P>
   What sort of wicked thrill, though, is gotten from seeing a
friend or neighbor suffer? Is this a form of envy (which Robert
Burton, in ``The Anatomy of Melancholy,'' called ``sorrow for other
men's good'' and ``joy at their harms'')? Is it cruelty (as in
Nietzsche's playful aphorism: ``To behold suffering gives pleasure,
but to cause another to suffer affords an even greater pleasure'')?
Is it a perverse sense of humor, like guffawing as someone fatally
slips on a banana peel? It is all of these _ vengeance, envy,
cruelty, mockery _ spiced with shame, secrecy and pride: a
mercurial, pungent emotion the Germans call Schadenfreude.
</P>
<P>
   Schadenfreude includes pleasure in another's comeuppance, but
also shame at having felt the pleasure. It is savored in private,
without public display, but it is also a reaction to the public
sphere. The historian Peter Gay _ who felt Schadenfreude as a
Jewish child in Nazi-era Berlin, watching the German's lose coveted
gold medals in the 1936 Olympics _ has said that it ``can be one of
the great joys of life.'' But R.C. Trench, an English archbishop
who first referred to Schadenfreude in English in 1852, noted that
the very word taints a culture. The German philosopher Schopenhauer
said it was a diabolical emotion, ``the infallible sign of an
entirely bad heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Schadenfreude is unavoidable, even without theatrical public
executions. As John Portmann notes in this wittily titled book,
``When Bad Things Happen to Other People,'' Schadenfreude occurs
``to virtually all noninfantile, noncomatose human beings _ not
just to Germans.''
</P>
<P>
   Its occurrence also raises many questions about the nature of
suffering, the character of pleasure and the meanings of their
continuing association _ an extraordinarily rich subject. But
Portmann seems to have suffered greatly in addressing these issues
and forces the reader to as well. Despite some fine nuggets
peppered through the text, the book is labored, contorted,
meandering, pedantic. I get no pleasure from saying that.
</P>
<P>
   If I am deciphering Portmann correctly (which is by no means
easy), it seems as if he wants to offer two cheers for
Schadenfreude and argue, however ambiguously, for its ``moral
acceptability.'' While pointing out its maliciousness, he also
suggests that Schadenfreude can be ``the emotional manifestation of
beliefs about justice'': if the other person suffers, the suffering
may well be a just dispensation, hence the pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Portmann argues that Schadenfreude teaches people to think about
their own relationship to suffering; it develops moral awareness.
He even suggests that one reason Schadenfreude has been wrongly
treated as an ``outlaw emotion'' is that it has been considered
feminine, making it a victim of misogyny in a patriarchal society.
Portmann pulls out all the stops to give Schadenfreude
respectability.
</P>
<P>
   But misogyny? Moral education? Justice? Portmann denatures
Schadenfreude, treats it as a variety of ``rational assessment.''
Yet Schadenfreude is most interesting and most powerful when it has
nothing to do with justice, when it does not discriminate in its
wry malice. It is not, as Portmann suggests, ``an emotional
corollary of justice.'' It is not the feeling that those
18th-century theatergoers experience in watching a public hanging.
</P>
<P>
   It is more like the feeling one of them might have when
another's wig comes lose or when a friend falls out of favor with
the court or goes bankrupt or even when another's death occurs
prematurely. The pleasure comes from the embarrassment or
diminishment of another _ whether deserved or not _ and if not, so
much the better. This is very different from the pleasure felt by a
sadist watching a victim writhe or by a bereaved family watching a
murderer be led to his punishment.
</P>
<P>
   In those extreme cases there is nothing contested or ambiguous;
there is no embarrassment to be accounted for. But Schadenfreude
comes unbidden from beyond the bounds of civil life, carrying
traces of ancient urges, undercutting our reasoned poise. Yet it
also is shaped by a refinement and delicacy that recognizes the
authority of civil life; the feeling of Schadenfreude imposes a
shame and embarrassment that mirrors the suffering of the victim.
</P>
<P>
   This makes Schadenfreude a solemn counterpart to humor, at once
expressing a forbidden sentiment while affirming the social order,
cloaking a brutish truth with the aura of manners. As Mark Twain
observed, ``It takes your enemy and your friend, working together,
to hurt you to the heart; the one to slander you and the other to
get the news to you.''  &QL;

 &HT;    ALLEGATIONS OF WAR CRIMES KEEP CHECHEN REFUGEES FROM HOME
 &HT;    (725&AMP;TRIM)
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SLEPTSOVSK, Russia _ Russian soldiers fighting in the Chechen
capital Grozny allegedly executed two female refugees and wounded
another who returned to the besieged city two weeks ago to check
their homes and relatives trapped there.
</P>
<P>
   According to Heida Makhauri, 41, three Interior Ministry
soldiers on Jan. 21 detained her and two neighbors _ also
middle-aged women _ and blindfolded them, with the soldiers saying
they were taking the women to the local militia office.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the soldiers led the women to a bombed-out home off of
Bukashova Street in the Staropromoslovskoe district in Grozny, the
district that the Russian forces reportedly had under their
control, and where the three women lived before the war, Makhauri
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were holding hands because we were scared,'' said Makhauri.
``When they stopped us, my neighbor, a tall woman, dropped my hand.
She pleaded with the soldiers to take what they wanted, money,
anything, but not kill us, because all of us had children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, she screamed. They shot her, then my friend, then me,''
recalled Makhauri from a hospital bed here in the Ingush border
town of Sleptsovsk where she is recovering from her wounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Jan. 21 incident is one of at least five accounts of alleged
war crimes perpetrated by Russian soldiers serving in Chechnya
against civilians, according to Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   Since September, Russia has waged war against Chechen rebel
fighters, an offensive Moscow says is necessary to wipe out Islamic
terrorists and bandits. More than 5,000 Russians have been wounded
or killed and an unknown number of rebels have died. More than
200,000 civilians have fled the fighting, and most of them are
living in refugee camps or private homes in the neighboring
republic of Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ekhardt, the Human Rights Watch field officer in
Ingushetia, said he has compiled testimony from refugees who allege
that Russian soldiers have killed 36 Chechen civilians, most of
them in summary executions.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts come from both refugees freshly arriving to the two
major refugee camps along the Ingush border, as well as Chechens
who have crossed and re-crossed the border near Sleptsovsk.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two months, the Russian government has been
pressuring refugees living in Ingushetia to return to their homes,
as the army reports itself in control of villages located in the
northern Chechen flatlands.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, aid workers say the government has rescinded
ration cards for Chechens who hail from these towns, forcing
refugees to choose between going hungry or crossing the border and
trusting their luck to get home.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Makhauri, are motivated by desperation and worry to
make their way home and check on their property, despite the safety
risk and growing lack of trust in the Russian army to protect
Chechen civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here don't have bank accounts or stock options. Their
wealth is tied up in the homes. When they lose their homes and
their property, they lose everything,'' said Ekhardt.
</P>
<P>
   (EDS: Begin Optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Makhauri said she and her friend, Gabriella Larisova, 45,
decided to return to their homes after watching television reports
of Russian officers saying Grozny's Staropromoslovskoe District was
safe and under federal control. The two neighbors fled with their
children to the Ingush town of Sleptsovsk after federal forces
began bombing Grozny in November.
</P>
<P>
   Makhauri said she and Larisova set off on Jan. 20, traveling
south to Grozny on a private shuttle bus. They met a neighbor from
Grozny on the outskirts of town on the way to their neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The three encountered the Russian soldiers along Bukashova
Street. Makhauri said she remembers that they were wearing uniforms
from the Russian Interior Ministry. She does not remember their
division, or their names.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Russian army officers nor Interior Ministry officials
could be reached for comment
</P>
<P>
   Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Makhauri said the soldiers shot dead the other two women, but
she was only wounded when a single bullet pierced her left
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   After shooting the women, the soldiers searched the bodies for
jewelry and money, but Makhauri said they didn't notice she was
still alive. She said the Russians stole her ring off her finger
and 400 rubles (US$15) she was carrying.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers then rolled the bodies in mattresses, set them on
fire and left, Makhauri said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mattress was wet, so it didn't catch fire. I can't tell you
how long I was laying there. I couldn't feel the left side of my
body, and I didn't want to yell because I didn't want the soldiers
to return,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After some time, two women found her, and carried Makhauri back
to their basement quarters. An estimated 15,000 civilians have been
trapped in Grozny, living in basements to escape the bombing. The
Russian army has refused to call a cease-fire for these people to
leave town, saying that would allow rebel forces to escape as well.
</P>
<P>
   She eventually made it back to the border, with the help of
these neighbors, she said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDS: End Optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   After more than a month of intense fighting, Russian forces plan
this weekend to declare the Chechen capital Grozny ``liberated''
from rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the estimated 1,000 rebels fighting in the
capital, one of two major strongholds of the Chechen fighters, made
a tactical retreat from the city. Their retreat came despite
Russian military assertions that they had completely cordoned off
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Like the first Chechen war in 1994-1996, Chechen commanders said
their strategy was to inflict heavy casualties against Russian
soldiers, not hold territory for territory's sake. Their snipers
and guerrilla battle tactics have done just that. On Friday, the
Russians announced that some 2,000 soldiers have died and about
3,000 wounded, a casualty rate higher than during the first war.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the rebel fighting force has retreated to the
mountains located in southern Chechnya. It is widely expected that
these forces will continue their guerrilla campaign against the
Russians from here.
</P>
<P>
   Aid officials based in Nazran, the Ingush capital, say they fear
that after the capture of Grozny, Russia will crank up the pressure
for refugees to leave their temporary homes in Ingushetia, despite
the possibility that fighting will continue in the near future.

   AUSTRIA-POLITICS (Vienna) _ Austria's new coalition of
conservatives and Joerg Haider's far-right Freedom Party took
office Friday and the United States said it was recalling its
ambassador for consultations. Austria's 14 European Union partners
began moves to isolate the new government politically, taking the

   TULSA-RACE-RIOT (Tulsa, Okla.) _ Nearly 80 years after a race
riot considered by some historians to have been the bloodiest in
the nation, a state-appointed commission on Friday recommended that
reparations be paid to families of the hundreds of victims who were
shot, burned alive or tied to cars and dragged to death. The
commission's recommendations, after two years of investigation, and
its findings that city and state officials bear responsibility for
the 1921 riot, are expected to further inflame a tense political
situation as the state legislature decides in coming weeks and
months how to proceed. By Jim Yardley.

   BUSH-CAMPAIGN (Austin, Texas) _ The day after Gov. George W.
Bush's defeat in the New Hampshire primary, he arrived in South
Carolina with a broad smile on his face, nary a trace of tension in
his shoulders and a robust arsenal of optimistic metaphors.
``There's bumps in the road,'' Bush said at a news conference in
Greenville, S.C., on Wednesday. But, he added, what lay ahead was
``a long, smooth highway.'' Neither his voice nor his words
reflected the heap of trouble he was in. That held true when the
Texas governor later chatted with reporters and saw fit to mention
that while he wanted the presidency, he was both grounded and
rounded enough to move on with his life if he did not get it. By

economic expansion became the longest in history, the nation's
employers added more jobs in January than they had in any single
month in more than two years _ drawing in people who had given up
looking for work and easing the struggle to make ends meet. Wall
Street saw the January employment numbers _ 387,000 new jobs, the
biggest increase since September 1997, and an unemployment rate
that ticked down to 4 percent, the lowest level in 30 years _ as
fresh evidence of a rising inflation rate, if not right away, then
by early spring. By Louis Uchitelle.

   ARMS-STRATEGY (Undated) _ Although the Cold War is over, some

not Armageddon _ is actually greater now. While Russia and the
United States continue reducing their massive strategic nuclear
arsenals _ from 4,700 each in 1992 to between 2,000 and 2,500 in
1998 _ the Kremlin's Security Council has approved a disturbing
shift in military doctrine under which nuclear weapons get a more

`MADAME BOVARY': FLAUBERT'S UNSUNG HERO AND HIS EXASPERATING WIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Broadcast notes appear at end of review. Time, channel are

(DW) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite the sunny hours of adulterous passion, Emma
Bovary is even better known for her lifetime of yearning
discontent. Sunday night's sharply drawn adaptation of Flaubert's
1857 novel by Heidi Thomas captures the predicament of the young
wife, scornful of the affection of a devoted husband, who demands
more of her handsome lovers than they prove able or willing to
give. But who could meet the needs or desires of a self-absorbed
woman who squandered her emotions on dreamy memories of dancing
with a gallant viscount much as she squandered the family savings
on fripperies?
</P>
<P>
   Frances O'Connor's entirely believable Emma is exasperating for
her unstoppable course toward ruin, yet manages to awaken a
grudging sympathy when her romantic impulses clash fatally with the
small-town conventions that Flaubert skewered and that she stupidly
accepted. She can be cruel, especially in her treatment of her
husband, Charles (Hugh Bonneville), but the worst injuries she
inflicts are on herself.
</P>
<P>
   It is Charles who wins our sympathy. Mary McCarthy gave the man
his due in her foreword to a 1976 edition of the novel, when she
contrasted the thoroughly banal Emma (``Her character is remarkable
only for an unusual deficiency of natural feeling'') with Charles,
whom she championed as the book's only real romantic.
</P>
<P>
   Although an undistinguished provincial doctor and something of a
philistine, Charles stands apart from the other townsfolks'
affectations and the trite ideas and vicious prejudices that
circulate from the town's circulating library. His love and loyalty
``in the teeth of circumstance, opinion, prudent self-interest, in
the teeth even of Emma herself,'' McCarthy wrote, make this
inherently good if flatly unheroic man the moral hero of the novel.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the cast live up to the demands of a work that,
unlike most of what shows up on ``Masterpiece Theater,'' is worthy
of the adjective. Emma's lovers are true to the book's portraits:
Greg Wise makes a dashing yet feckless Rodolphe and Hugh Dancy, as
Leon, is a smitten but platitudinous young admirer. The men and
their mistress deserve each other. A steamy encounter between Leon
and Emma in a closed carriage reminds us of why Flaubert had to
suffer a trial for ``immorality,'' a puerile charge against a work
of high morality.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteenth-century life in the Normandy countryside is smartly
evoked by the producer, Tony Redston, and the director, Tim Fywell,
with the help of such veterans of the British stage as Eileen
Atkins and Trevor Peacock. They do justice to Flaubert.

   OLY-VOLLEYBALL-HALEY _ AUSTIN, Texas _ A little more than three
years ago Mick Haley thought he was getting a dream job. The pull
of the coaching the U.S. team was enough to pry him away from
Texas, where he'd won two national championships in a sport once
dominated by California schools. He compiled a 522-137-1 record in
his 17 years in Austin. Haley knew the Olympic job would be a
rebuilding effort. The 1996 team, coached by Terry Liskevych, had
hoped to medal in Atlanta. But, while other U.S. women's sports
from soccer to softball found gold and legions of new fans, the
volleyball team finished a disappointing seventh. That triggered a
slide in other areas. Two sponsors, Champion and Ricoh, pulled out.
Because of non-performance, the team lost some other funding and
needed to cut back on expenses. Demetria Sance, a former Longhorn,
is one of Haley's star players. Developing. (Maher, Austin

   OLY-VOLLEYBALL-HALEY _ AUSTIN, Texas _ A little more than three
years ago Mick Haley thought he was getting a dream job. The pull
of the coaching the U.S. team was enough to pry him away from
Texas, where he'd won two national championships in a sport once
dominated by California schools. He compiled a 522-137-1 record in
his 17 years in Austin. Haley knew the Olympic job would be a
rebuilding effort. The 1996 team, coached by Terry Liskevych, had
hoped to medal in Atlanta. But, while other U.S. women's sports
from soccer to softball found gold and legions of new fans, the
volleyball team finished a disappointing seventh. That triggered a
slide in other areas. Two sponsors, Champion and Ricoh, pulled out.
Because of non-performance, the team lost some other funding and
needed to cut back on expenses. Demetria Sance, a former Longhorn,
is one of Haley's star players. Developing. (Maher, Austin

HILLARY CLINTON FACES TOUGH NEW YORK SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 By STEWART M. POWELL   
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton has her work cut
out for her when she launches her long-awaited New York Senate
campaign on Sunday _ the first political campaign in history by a
first lady.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old native of Illinois will be joined by President
Clinton, their 19-year-old daughter Chelsea and her mother, Dorothy
Rodham, on a college campus in Purchase, N.Y., for the formal
announcement of her campaign against the likely Republican rival,
New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's announcement at Purchase College will be relayed via
television to 24,000 supporters packed into more than 500 homes
around the state. Clinton planned to follow up with a campaign
whirlwind to Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Albany and New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of her announcement, Clinton has sponsored radio
advertisements appealing for volunteers to enlist in ``a
grass-roots campaign that reaches out to New Yorkers across the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidate, who honed her political skills during her
husband's political campaigns in Arkansas and two successful
campaigns for the presidency, vowed to focus her campaign on
family-related issues such as expanding the Family and Medical
Leave Act; modernizing public schools; expanding after-school
programs; broadening access to ``quality, affordable health care;''
obtaining drug coverage for Medicare patients; and allowing tax
deductions for up to $10,000-a-year in college tuition payments.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Clinton has raised has $8.3 million and Giuliani has
raised $11.5 million for what is expected to be the first $50
million-plus Senate campaign in American history. The cost of the
showdown is expected to exceed the $44 million spent in
California's 1994 Senate race by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.,
and Rep. Michael Huffington, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's new legal residence is the $1.7 million home in
Chappaqua, N.Y. that she and her husband purchased last year.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady has been assembling a campaign team and
advertising operation, appearing on David Letterman's late night
talk show, fielding questions about her marriage and staging
rehearsals for the rapid-fire, tit-for-tat exchanges that are the
hallmark of New York's tempestuous politics.
</P>
<P>
   That politics-with-an-edge was on display last week when
Giuliani complained that Clinton's campaign finance reports to the
Federal Election Commission showed that her campaign had reimbursed
taxpayers for only $34,000 for dozens of campaign-related trips on
U.S. government aircraft since she began her ``listening tour'' of
the state last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like that deal,'' jabbed Giuliani, an in-your-face,
Brooklyn-born New Yorker who seems to relish the rough and tumble
of New York politics.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson countered that it is ``hard to
take his latest tantrum seriously'' given the mayor's practice of
``running his campaign out of City Hall at taxpayers' expense.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal election laws require federal candidates using official
aircraft to reimburse the treasury the equivalent of a first class
fare for each campaign-related traveler _ a fraction of the actual
cost of operating the kind of Air Force jets used by the first
family. Rep. John Sweeney, R-N.Y., proposed legislation last year
to require candidates such as Clinton to reimburse the full cost of
aircraft operations but the measure, passed by the House, has yet
to receive Senate consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and her campaign staff have equally poked at Giuliani,
demanding that the two-term mayor call off ``the far right'' from
waging what they claim is a ``campaign of lies and deceit'' in
direct mail fund raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign sought to exploit Giuliani's unwitting
attendance at an event with Austria's far-right Freedom Party
leader Joerg Haider, who has stirred controversy with remarks
earlier in his career when he praised Adolph Hitler's ``orderly
employment practices'' and called veterans of Hitler's elite Waffen
SS ``decent people of good character.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been nearly two weeks since Rudy Giuliani shared a dais
with Joerg Haider. Why hasn't he spoken out?'' demanded Wolfson in
a bid to build support for Clinton among New York's politically
influential Jewish voters. ``Why didn't he throw Joerg Haider out
of the room?''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said that he didn't know Haider was going to be at the
event.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Giuliani had seized upon Clinton's controversial
appearance on the West Bank in Israel last fall with the wife of
Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat. When Mrs. Arafat condemned
Israel's alleged use of ``poison gas'' to quell rioting
Palestinians, Clinton was criticized in the New York Jewish
community for failing to challenge her assertion.
</P>
<P>
   Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public
Opinion, at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., said Clinton
faces formidable challenges in her race to succeed retiring Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton trails the New York mayor, 47 percent to 40 percent,
according to the latest Marist poll, released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that Clinton has not generated winning
margins of support from traditional Democratic constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   She is splitting the women's vote with Giuliani rather than
rolling up the 19-percentage point edge that helped Rep. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., oust veteran Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., in
1998. Clinton's margin of support among Jewish voters is equally
imperiled, with the mayor ahead 46 percent to 41 percent. Schumer
enjoyed a 53-point edge over D'Amato among Jewish voters who
represented 12 percent of the electorate in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also trails Giuliani among Roman Catholic voters, 44
percent of the voters in 1998, upstate voters and suburban voters.
</P>
<P>
   The lone constituencies that Clinton has won over with the same
enthusiasm as Schumer are urban minorities, including
African-Americans and Hispanics. Clinton has the support of 82
percent of New York state's black voters compared to Giuliani's 4
percent _ a margin bolstered in part by Clinton's appearance last
month on the same stage as controversial Rev. Al Sharpton at
ceremonies honoring the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King.
</P>
<P>
   Miringoff said Clinton ``needs to stress how she can build
coalitions in the Senate to help New York in contrast to Giuliani _
a one-man wrecking crew.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Miringoff said, the mayor must cling to his
role as the incumbent mayor and campaign as a can-do leader. This
role may complicate his efforts to build support in GOP strongholds
in upstate New York where residents are traditionally leery of New
York City politicians. New Yorkers have never elected a New York
City mayor to serve in the Senate nor have they elected a New York
mayor to a major statewide office in more than 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   What may decide the outcome may be the voter turnout provoked by
the race for the White House, Miringoff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two candidates are such big names they won't be riding
anybody's coattails but the higher turnout for a presidential
election usually helps Democrats,'' Miringoff said.
</P>
<P>
   New York has voted Democratic in seven of the 10 presidential
elections since 1960. Democrats account for 47 percent of the 10.9
million registered voters; Republicans account for 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Guliani already has used his post as mayor of the nation's
largest city as a bully pulpit for his candidacy. He devoted his
annual ``state of the city'' message on Jan. 13 to touting the 70
percent slash in the city's murder rate, to its lowest level since
1964; forging $10.4 billion in tax cuts over eight years; fostering
a $2 billion city budget surplus and creating 305,000 new
private-sector jobs in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has even used his position to urge winter tourism in
New York City in a $340,000 taxpayer-subsidized ad campaign in
which the mayor urges would-be tourists in Washington,
Philadelphia, Boston and Hartford _ and upstate cities and New York
City suburbs _ to visit Gotham to ``paint the town red.''

`COCKTAIL' TOSS: BARTENDING AS AN EXTREME SPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Feb. 6)  
(lh) 
 By RICK MARIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a stage recently vacated by David Cassidy, a young Lithuanian
man was walking on broken glass. In bare feet. While juggling three
liquor bottles. Members of the crowd in the Copacabana Showroom in
the Rio All-Suite Casino Resort in Las Vegas were clapping like
seals. Even in the land of Siegfried, Roy and Buddy Hackett,
they've never seen anything quite like Mindaugas Gradeckas.
</P>
<P>
   Not from a bartender.
</P>
<P>
   No mere bartender, Gradeckas, 23, is a flair bartender. He is,
according to his business card, the Lithuanian and Russian flair
champion. Also known as ``extreme bartending'' or ``performance
bartending,'' flair is the art of juggling bottles and flipping
glasses in the air and pouring drinks in athletic poses. It's Tom
Cruise in ``Cocktail.'' And here at the second annual Legends of
Bartending championships last month, Gradeckas didn't even make the
finals.
</P>
<P>
   Serious mixologists dismiss these showmen (and occasional
show-women) as exhibitionists. Strictly T.G.I. Friday's. Many bar
owners, fearful of spillage and breakage, forbid bottle flipping on
their premises. And some patrons are bound to wonder, Can these
guys make a decent drink?
</P>
<P>
   But flair is fighting back. A Flair Bartending Association _ or
FBA, as its members know it _ started in 1997, and its ranks rose
to 740, from 260 members in 1999. Flair bartenders of the world
have united, bonded by the belief that what they do is a sport, one
worthy of respect and coverage on ESPN. So far, neither of those
things has been forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Respect is a major issue in the world of flair. Consider its
conflicted relationship with ``Cocktail,'' the 1988 saga of a young
bottle-flipping bartender's quest for the meaning of life and
Elisabeth Shue. A recent issue of the flair association's
newsletter led with the banner headline, ``I Am Not Tom.''
</P>
<P>
   While the movie popularized what flair bartenders do and sent
many of them into their vocations, they're sick of hearing about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh hi, Tom Cruise!'' is the inevitable patron reaction, said
Robin Weiss, who tends bar at his two restaurants in Germany.
``There is no shift without that.'' For Nathan Taylor, the
defending Legends champion, Cruise was an inspiration. ``He's
making money, he's getting girls,'' Taylor said, his next cigarette
rakishly perched above his ear and his clear Cruiselike eyes
alight.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Cruise's character was also sleazy, at least
while under the influence of his cynical mentor, played by Bryan
Brown. And his technique was lousy.
</P>
<P>
   As Rob Corrujo, from Ridgefield, N.J., explained, ``When I
started flipping, I'd be like, `Wow, he's really good,' but now
that I know, I can see how lame he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Corrujo was the closest thing to a New Yorker at the tournament.
Surprisingly _ or maybe not _ flair is not big in Manhattan.
Corrujo recently quit bartending at his local Chili's to go into
the family grocery business. He came to defend his title as last
year's winner of the ``pour test,'' which rates a bartender's
ability to pour exactly an ounce, an ounce-and-a-quarter or two
ounces of liquor, without measuring.
</P>
<P>
   The pour and speed tests are compulsory events in the Legends of
Bartending tournament. They're designed to keep it in the hands of
professional bartenders, and away from some Cirque du Soleil
interloper. The speed test calls for six drinks, everything from
opening a beer to blending a daiquiri, as fast as possible. Bill
Long, from Naples, Fla., did it in 1:18. Nobody topped that.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights before the finals, the flair association convened a
meeting at the Wine Cellar in the Rio's carnival-themed shopping
mall. Rowdy Canadian representatives shouted imprecations of
friendly abuse. A supercool group from Italy sat at a table smoking
stylishly. The testosterone flowed like Budweiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call me Rocket,'' explained Joe Pereira, 29, one of the
many T.G.I. Friday's bartenders here, from Boston. ``I like to go
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Pereira made the finals last year, after practicing seven to
eight hours a day _ and that was when he wasn't working at the bar.
T.G.I. Friday's _ where flash behind the bar is part of the
franchise _ sponsors nationwide competitions for its bartenders.
Pereira won $2,000 at the last one, after ``eight months of stress
and hard work.'' Upturning one palm, he showed off a wound
sustained in the line of duty and said, ``I'm looking for that
fever again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hall had it. As one of the competition's judges and its
chief organizer, Hall took the podium and addressed the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys ready to flip some bottles?''
</P>
<P>
   Hall announced that the turnout, 71 bartenders, was double last
year's. One entrant had flown in from Seoul, South Korea, at his
own expense, he said, then lamented that Team Argentina ``couldn't
get the funds together.'' After some rule clarification and
housekeeping, the microphone was handed over to Toby Ellis, the
founder of the association, who showed a couple of videos and spoke
against division in the ranks between Americans and Europeans, and
the jugglers versus the nonjugglers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has their own style, and every style is very cool,''
said Ellis, a wiry shot of adrenaline, who tends bar in Syracuse,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Gradeckas, a blond Pee-wee Herman in his high-buttoned suit and
buzz cut, observed the proceedings with quiet confidence. ``Every
soldier wants to be a general,'' he intoned gravely.
</P>
<P>
   The qualifying rounds of this three-day marathon ran from noon
on Monday until almost 3 a.m. Tuesday morning. Eight finalists
survived. Gradeckas, the hands-down winner of the flair round, was
eliminated because his actual drink-making left something to be
desired.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Long, 34, a veteran of flair competitions, is regarded as
one of the top three flair men in the United States. He impressed
the judges by flipping a cocktail from one hand to the other,
without spilling a drop. The drink didn't even move inside the
glass as it flew end over end through the air. Turned out Long
slipped a little magic powder in the glass under the bar to
solidify the liquid. Cheating is acceptable, if done with flair.
</P>
<P>
   The other two top names in the game, by common consensus,
absented themselves from this competition: Hall and Alan Mays. Both
had been recruited from Florida to work at the Rio's VooDoo Lounge.
While Hall kept score, Mays recorded the event on video. The Rio,
along with liquor companies like Tanqueray and Sauza Tequila,
sponsored the event.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a legend at this Legends competition, it was Mays.
The other bartenders were in awe of him. Vicki Wildman, the only
woman in the competition, testified to seeing Mays watch a new
flair move, then replicate it flawlessly.
</P>
<P>
   An old man by flair standards at age 36, Mays is Gary Cooper in
a white button-down. Tall, laconic, polite, he stands out in a
saloon full of excitable bottle-slingers just by standing still.
</P>
<P>
   ``Might hurt himself,'' Mays said, wincing, as he videotaped a
baby-faced bartender trying to keep three bottles in the air above
his head, hands slippery with spill and flop sweat. ``Going to end
up in the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, down came a rain of bottles on the kid's head and
shoulders. Mercifully, they had not crashed and exploded in midair
_ an occupational hazard.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can learn some tricks in half an hour,'' Mays continued.
``Others take years.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As the bartenders sweated through the qualifying round, those
awaiting their turns loitered in the casino's Rio Bamba Cabaret,
knocking back beers. Some retreated to their rooms, where they had
set up makeshift practice bars on sink counters and ironing boards.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans complained that the Americans were too fixated on
flipping: three, four, even five bottles at a time. ``Typical
American: more, more, more,'' said Sam de Bolle, a Dutch bartender
and bar consultant. ``I don't like to see myself as a clown.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another sore point among flair bartenders is the question of
practical bartending ability. Dale De Groff, the former (and
somewhat legendary) bartender at the Rainbow Room from 1987 until
its closing in 1998, recently judged a flair contest. ``They're
marvelous,'' he said, in a telephone interview from his office in
New York. ``But I don't know how many of them can make drinks we
want to drink.'' Asked why flair is not practiced on an island
libatious enough to have a cocktail named after it, he said,
``Manhattan is a serious bar town.'' A town whose tipplers don't
want a juggler, he said. ``They want a good martini.''
</P>
<P>
   Toby Ellis dated ``modern-day flair'' back to Dallas in the late
1970s and a T.G.I. Friday's bartender known as Tarzan. But Florida
is its ground zero. Long works at a restaurant called Yabba in
Naples, Fla. Hall and Mays came to Las Vegas from Orlando, Fla.,
where even drinking has been Disneyfied. The two major flair
training and consulting outfits, Showtenders and BarStarz, are
based in Orlando. A handsome hotshot from Showtenders, Pat
McNamara, made the finals, as did Paul Riebenack, from an Orlando
Friday's.
</P>
<P>
   For his exhibition round in the flair finals, Riebenack, a young
man with a shaved head whose nickname is Alcohol Paul, had the
house lights turned almost off, then emerged in a black, hooded
jumpsuit outlined in glow-in-the-dark green. ``You're a freak!''
the Friday's contingent shouted, as Riebenack mixed phosphorescent
beverages and did a trippy dance. Riebenack's rave-club stylings
encapsulated flair's strange combination of extreme-sports attitude
and road-show performance art.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Long, the old pro, who barely broke a sweat during the
qualifying rounds, took the title and the $5,000 grand prize this
year. Corrujo, who took the pour test title again and $1,000 for
the second year in a row, vowed to come back next year with better
flair. ``I'm going to start practicing tomorrow,'' he said. ``I'm
going to turn it up.''
</P>
<P>
   In his ``Official Mixer's Manual,'' Patrick Gavin Duffy wrote in
1934, ``Bartending is an old and honorable trade.'' But is it a
sport? Is the Flair Bartending Association in the same league as
the National Basketball Association, or at least as the billiard
sharps and lumberjacks and spelling bee prodigies seen on ESPN2?
</P>
<P>
   Asked if flair had a chance at cable air time, an ESPN
spokesman, Josh Krulewitz, tried to sound encouraging. ``We're
obviously open to a proposal from anybody,'' he said. ``And we've
gotten proposals in the past from people you would not think would
make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, there's always ``Cocktail.''

   A large area of low clouds covering the eastern Ohio Valley and
the entire west slope of the Appalachians will shrink in size as
drier and somewhat milder air flows in from the west. High pressure
crested over northern Louisiana will draw unseasonably mild weather
from the Southwest into the western Plains. Readings may rise 20
degrees above normal from western Texas to central Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   The leading edge of a fresh polar air mass will push southward
across the Great Lakes and be followed by gusty snow showers. The
brunt of the frigid air will move into central and northern New
England Sunday as temperatures fall to near zero and winds reach 30
mph. High pressure in Alberta should race into the Middle West and
sponsor dry and cool conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds will cover much of the West. A large but weakening storm
off the Northwest coast will direct another cold front inland with
rain at the shore from the Bay area to central Oregon and snow in
the higher elevations of the northern Sierra and southern Cascades.
Showers will dampen parts of the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest will see sunshine dimmed by high clouds, but
readings will stay above seasonal levels.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Constant Climate
</P>
<P>
   Exposed to prevailing winds off the Pacific, the coastal town of
Eureka, Calif., has one of the most constant climates in the
nation. The large swings that are common in daily and interseasonal
temperatures at most places are unusual at Eureka. The average
temperature there ranges from 47.4 degrees in January to 57.0
degrees in August. Yet, the mercury soared to a record 73 degrees
on Thursday. A stalled storm off the West Coast brought persistent
mild winds from the southeast, giving residents of Eureka a rare
sample of the variable climate of the vast continent to the east.

GET READY FOR WINDOWS 2000  
(DW)

<TEXT>
<P>
   With 2000 here, can Windows 2000 be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. will release its new version of the Windows
operating system for businesses on Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
   As a home user, you probably won't rush right out and buy it.
The estimated retail price is about three shares of Microsoft stock
at Friday's prices ($102 a share) for an outright purchase. If
upgrading from Windows 95 or Windows 98, it's still roughly two
MSFT shares ($219). Users of Windows NT can upgrade for $149.
</P>
<P>
   The official launch will be at the IDG Windows 2000 Conference
and Expo in San Francisco, which will be keyed to 70 simultaneous
events in cities around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Bill Gates has invited only a few of his close
personal friends: about 1,500 people are expected in each city.
There will be vendor exhibits and sessions for business owners and
technology professionals on how to use Windows 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The events are free, but registration is required. A list of
venues and registration information is available at, of course,
www.microsoft.com.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 2000 is basically the upgrade for Microsoft's Windows
NT, the business version of Windows 98. It comes in three versions,
ranging from the entry-level Professional for business desktops and
notebooks, to Advanced Service for e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The two server programs carry a business-like price, too: $999
for a server version and $3,999 for an advanced server version
(half that if upgrading to either program from Windows NT).
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft bills the operating system as the ``most reliable
operating system in the Windows family.'' Microsoft Corp. has been
running on it exclusively for many months, even before the product
went out to major clients. More than 500 person-years and $162
million has been spent on testing.
</P>
<P>
   It supports more than 11,000 hardware devices ranging from
printers to digital cameras. It automatically installs and
configures itself _ a plus for system administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Another nice networking feature: the system administrator can
install software to individual desktop machines on the system from
the server, rather than visiting each workstation. Microsoft said
that could save hundreds, if not thousands, of hours in a large
enterprise.

<P>
   On Dec. 10, 1971, John Lennon played at a rally in Ann Arbor,
Mich., to clamor for the release of John Sinclair, a poet sent to
jail on marijuana charges.
</P>
<P>
   The cream of the American counterculture was there, including
such anti-establishment luminaries as the poet Allen Ginsberg, the
``Yippies'' Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, and the co-founder of
the Black Panther movement, Bobby Seale.
</P>
<P>
   So too was the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The feds were interested in John Lennon because they had heard
that he opposed the war in Vietnam. They were interested because he
advocated the legalization of marijuana. In short, he sounded like
a dangerous man, so they followed him and wrote him up in extensive
confidential reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennon prior to rally composed the following song entitled
`John Sinclair,' which song Lennon sang at the rally,'' went the
painfully bureaucratic account of the Ann Arbor appearance.
</P>
<P>
   And, just in case the higher-ups weren't too sure who this was
about, the report added helpfully: ``Lennon formerly with group
known as the Beatles.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI file on Lennon would continue for another year, from the
time of his closest contacts with the New Left radicals, through
the crisis over his threatened deportation from the United States,
right up to Richard Nixon's reelection as president in November
1972.
</P>
<P>
   FBI director J. Edgar Hoover himself, just a few months before
his death in May 1972, directed that the case be conducted ``on an
expedite basis and by mature, experienced agents.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that Lennon was under surveillance. He himself
strongly suspected it, and subsequent requests for his file under
the U.S. Freedom of Information Act revealed the existence of a
281-page FBI dossier. But for many years, more than 70 percent of
that file was blacked out on grounds of ``national security.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, all but 10 of the pages have come to light, thanks to the
dogged efforts of a Californian history professor, Jon Wiener, who
spent 14 years suing the FBI for them.
</P>
<P>
   And what they reveal is an extraordinary portrait of official
paranoia, laughably amateurish investigative techniques and an
utter dearth of evidence to suggest that Lennon was contemplating
any kind of criminal behavior whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lennon files constitute a small but significant chapter in
the history of the Sixties, and of the Watergate era,'' Wiener
writes in his book ``Gimme Some Truth: The John Lennon FBI File,''
to be published later this month by University of California Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``They... include some comic and hilarious moments. The FBI at
points looks more like the Keystone Cops than the Gestapo. But the
campaign to `neutralize' Lennon wasn't a joke: it was a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The rationale behind the surveillance of Lennon, Wiener argues,
was exactly the same as that which led Nixon to order the Watergate
break-in: he was determined to silence his enemies to ensure
reelection.
</P>
<P>
   When the operation began, Lennon was at the height of his
political activism _ this was the time of his agitprop songs and
bed-ins for peace _ and he was starting to take explicit positions
on politics in the U.S., where he had arrived a few months
earlier. &QL;

<P>
   At the Ann Arbor rally, Jerry Rubin turned to the audience and
urged ``a million of you to turn up at the Republican National
Convention to humiliate and defeat Richard Nixon.''
</P>
<P>
   Lennon himself was contemplating a series of political concerts
in election year. Given his popular following, the authorities
perhaps had reason to be nervous. There was just one catch: not
only was the expression of political opinions not a crime, it was
explicitly protected by the U.S. Constitution, even for foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to have done little to deter the Nixon
administration, which at the time was considering mugging
demonstrators outside the Republican Convention and abducting Abbie
Hoffman and Jerry Rubin to Mexico. (John Mitchell, the attorney
general, complained that this would be too expensive, so they
turned to the Watergate break-in as Plan B.) &QL;

   The FBI drew up memos urging Lennon's arrest, on drugs charges
if at all possible (it never happened), and even made a ``wanted''
poster whose most striking characteristic _ only now made public _
is that the photograph was not of Lennon at all, but of another
singer with long hair and glasses called David Peel. Ah well, these
rock singers all look alike... &QL;

   The veteran South Carolina senator Strom Thurmond sent a
confidential memo to the White House warning of Lennon's political
leanings and adding: ``If Lennon's visa is terminated it would be a
strategy countermeasure.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later a reply came from William E. Timmons, a
presidential aide: ``I thought you would be interested in learning
that the Immigration and Naturalization Service has served notice
on him that he is to leave this country no later than March 15.'' &QL;

<P>
   What had Lennon done to raise the official alarm so? And what
was it about the FBI's discoveries that required them to stay
carefully wrapped in the mantle of secrecy for so long?
</P>
<P>
   The answer yielded by the newly declassified documents is both
risible and disturbing. Risible, because the FBI appears to have
had nothing on Lennon at all except a series of donations to
nonviolent political causes.
</P>
<P>
   Disturbing, because the official argument of national security
(in one court filing, the FBI even claimed that declassification
could entail the risk of ``foreign military retaliation'') appears
to have been an excuse to cover up the bureau's embarrassment at
having done yet more of the Nixon White House's dirty work _ and
done it badly, to boot.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1971 and early 1972, Lennon was indeed close to the
anti-Vietnam radicals, hosted long strategy sessions at his rented
loft, and was a member of a group called the Election Year Strategy
Information Center run by Rubin and Rennie Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for money to cover the insurance of bands being proposed
for the Republican Convention protest, he wrote a check for
$40,000. Asked to participate himself, he let it be known he was
thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   But the files don't flesh this out at all. Among the items kept
confidential for more than a decade are the lyrics to the song
``John Sinclair,'' which an informant typed up from the Ann Arbor
concert.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to have escaped the FBI's notice that the same lyrics
are printed on the sleeve of Lennon's album ``Some Time In New York
City,'' which appeared a few months later.
</P>
<P>
   Other items include informants' reports on Lennon and his
radical friends, which veer from the banal to the absurd.
</P>
<P>
   One dispatch includes a story about a parrot trained ``to
interject `right on!' whenever the conversation gets rousing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe that this was deemed a threat to national
security for 14 years _ but there is a more serious undertone.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the same narrative, Lennon is quoted saying he
will attend the conventions only ``if they are peaceful.'' That
clearly weakens the justification for the FBI investigation, and
perhaps accounts for the official reluctance to release it. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (THIRD TRIM: STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,250, OR CONTINUE TO
</ANNOTATION>
1,500) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Wiener has uncovered plentiful further embarrassments, including
a farcical mix-up after Lennon's immigration lawyer, Leon Wildes,
noted that Lennon had become involved in a ``national anti-drug
media effort.''
</P>
<P>
   This referred to a body set up by the American Bar Association,
but the FBI misinterpreted it to mean that John Lennon had joined
the Nixon administration's National Commission on Marijuana and
Drug Abuse. The wonderfully comic mistake is perpetuated in memo
after memo for months afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   Reading Wiener's account, one can take issue with his
protestations of Lennon's good intentions. Albert Goldman, author
of an admittedly unsympathetic biography, thought Lennon was naive,
at the very least, to think he could play the radical politician
without getting into trouble, and argues that he only escaped more
serious heat because he dropped his political program once the
problems with immigration began.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman even quotes one acquaintance of the time, the rock
groupie AJ Webberman, as saying: ``Lennon believed in violence.''
True or not, the point is that the FBI never did find any evidence
but kept snooping around anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In one delicious moment of official delirium, someone scrawled
in capital letters at the bottom of a file entry: ``ALL EXTREMISTS
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED DANGEROUS.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Wiener likens the affair to a ``rock'n'roll Watergate.''
``The FBI is supposed to catch criminals,'' he says, ``not to stop
people from criticizing the President.''
</P>
<P>
   And for him, the case is not over yet: Wiener is still
determined to lay his hands on the outstanding 10 pages, and later
this month he's going back to court to argue for their release. &QL;

   Wiener has uncovered plentiful further embarrassments, including
a farcical mix-up after Lennon's immigration lawyer, Leon Wildes,
noted that Lennon had become involved in a ``national anti-drug
media effort.''
</P>
<P>
   This referred to a body set up by the American Bar Association,
but the FBI misinterpreted it to mean that John Lennon had joined
the Nixon administration's National Commission on Marijuana and
Drug Abuse. The wonderfully comic mistake is perpetuated in memo
after memo for months afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   Reading Wiener's account, one can take issue with his
protestations of Lennon's good intentions. Albert Goldman, author
of an admittedly unsympathetic biography, thought Lennon was naive,
at the very least, to think he could play the radical politician
without getting into trouble, and argues that he only escaped more
serious heat because he dropped his political program once the
problems with immigration began.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman even quotes one acquaintance of the time, the rock
groupie AJ Webberman, as saying: ``Lennon believed in violence.''
True or not, the point is that the FBI never did find any evidence
but kept snooping around anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In one delicious moment of official delirium, someone scrawled
in capital letters at the bottom of a file entry: ``ALL EXTREMISTS
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED DANGEROUS.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Wiener likens the affair to a ``rock'n'roll Watergate.''
``The FBI is supposed to catch criminals,'' he says, ``not to stop
people from criticizing the President.''
</P>
<P>
   And for him, the case is not over yet: Wiener is still
determined to lay his hands on the outstanding 10 pages, and later
this month he's going back to court to argue for their release. &QL;

   DILI _ Senior Indonesian generals masterminded a campaign of
repression and coercion in East Timor, in a desperate attempt to
prevent the territory from voting for independence, according to
secret military letters obtained by The Independent.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, recovered from military premises by human-rights
workers in the East Timorese capital, Dili, provide the first
conclusive evidence of what has long been suspected, but never
proved _ that, for months before the United Nations referendum on
East Timor's independence last August, it was being systematically
undermined by the Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated denials by Indonesia, the documents show that
the army was supplying scores of automatic weapons to its local
militia groups and pro-Jakarta puppets in the local government who
used them to murderous effect in the first half of last year.
</P>
<P>
   In blatant violation of the agreement signed by their government
in the United Nations, officers in Dili asked for naval ships to
distribute free rice among the people, as a means of bribing voters
in last August's referendum to support continuing association with
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, having accepted the likelihood of defeat, the
military hatched and executed a plan for a massive so-called
``evacuation'' _ the forced deportation of 250,000 people into
Indonesian West Timor, after the overwhelming vote for independence
was announced in early September.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, copies of which have been provided by The
Independent to Indonesian human-rights investigators in Jakarta,
implicate officers at every level of the military hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the missing link,'' said one western diplomat, after The
Independent showed him the documents. ``It connects the military to
the use of repression and coercion, and it shows a clear chain of
command from close to the very top.''
</P>
<P>
   The most damning document is a letter from the army
chief-of-staff, General Subagyo Hadi Siswoyo to the then-military
commander in Dili, and copied to senior figures in the military
hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   It consists of an order, ``to prepare a security plan to prevent
civil war that includes... repressive/coercive measures and a plan
to move to the rear/evacuate if the second option (independence) is
chosen.''
</P>
<P>
   The documents will add to pressure for war crimes prosecutions
against those implicated in last September's violence.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's most powerful general, Wiranto, continued to defy
calls for his resignation by the country's president, Abdurrahman
Wahid, increasing fears of a dangerous split between the army and
civilian establishments. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Perhaps it was a slow news night in New York, but
there was a ``Day of the Locust'' feel _ screaming and pushing
paparazzi, press and hangers-on _ outside Industria Superstudio in
Manhattan Tuesday evening for the Lane Bryant runway show of
intimate apparel. A publicist muttered to me: ``Whoever thought
they'd turn out like this to see the big gals.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, really. I am a big gal, and I was there to get some
inspiration. I had recently lost some weight and bought a new
wardrobe, and a guy had re-entered my life. (Standard story: old
boyfriend, 22 years later, via the Internet.) Like any woman in
such a position, I was considering lingerie. But unlike models in
most lingerie ads, I had more I wanted to cover up than I wanted to
reveal.
</P>
<P>
   No fear, it seems. Big gals are suddenly trendy. Look at the
Bijan ads with the naked fat lady being painted by Bijan or joining
him in bed. The Wilhelmina agency concluded a search this week
through 25,000 candidates for its next plus-size supermodel. (OK,
at Wilhelmina, 10 is a plus size. Still, the sentiment counts.)
</P>
<P>
   And just as I was getting ready for lingerie, lingerie was
getting ready for gals like me. Chris Hansen, the executive vice
president for marketing at Lane Bryant, the specialty clothing line
for plus-size women, told me that while lingerie sales for all
women were up 6 percent in 1999, intimate apparel for women
starting at Size 14 was up nearly 9 percent. Lingerie is expected
to jump to 20 percent of the company's business this year, from 12
percent last year, as Lane Bryant offers more and better styles and
spreads the word that big and bare is beautiful. Sales of all
plus-size intimate apparel totaled $6 billion last year nationally.
You know what that means? There are an awful lot of us out there.
</P>
<P>
   And hey, on its Web site, Victoria's Secret offers only three
regular bras in sizes larger than 38DD. A big woman needs more
variety than that.
</P>
<P>
   But variety leads only to choice, and choice leads to the
question: What do men look for in lingerie? The way I figure it,
men's tastes vary, depending on what underwear they first ogled
when they were 12. If it was the bra-and-panty ads in the front of
The New York Times Magazine, the gear required might be fairly
straightforward: perhaps a powder blue Cross Your Heart bra. But if
the guy in question imprinted on December, I might be in for black
lace-up boots, a red velvet body suit with white fur trim and a
stocking cap.
</P>
<P>
   I began fishing around among my male friends, trying to get a
hint of what colors and styles they considered hot. While I
envisioned a vast repertory of leopard print tap pants, pink silk
camisoles and filmy negligees, the men I talked with had only one
thing on their minds: matching bras and panties in solid colors. A
37-year-old I think of as a swinging sophisticate _ OK, someone at
work _ jumped at the chance of offering advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``No red,'' he said. ``It's usually tacky and cheap. Unless, of
course, there is a nice expensive burgundy from Hanro. Black works,
but it has to be matching bra and panties. Patterns, only if it's
the really expensive French stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By the way,'' he said, ``I think stylish, fashionable,
seductive lingerie should be worn all the time, routinely _ not
that I've met any woman who did that.''
</P>
<P>
   A much-married 63-year-old London architect, critic and
professed bon viveur had an anything-goes attitude. ``A
white-on-white effect certainly sounds fair enough to me,'' he
said. ``Oh nursie!''
</P>
<P>
   But of course, all this was just prelude. There was only one
opinion that counted, and it wasn't mine. I called a 55-year-old
inventor in San Francisco. OK, the guy I'm dating.
</P>
<P>
   He had the most specific taste of all: ``The only acceptable
color is black,'' he said, gravely. ``Bra and panties. But it all
starts with the footwear: high heels, stiletto heels, with a
steeply angled, pointed toe. It does something to the calf, the
whole leg. Or it could be an open-toed shoe with an ankle strap.
And black stockings, no pattern, with a seam. Garter belt. A lace
teddy is nice, but it all has to be expensive. At least $200 an
item. And a wide black choker around the neck. Very evocative. Very
French, very Brigitte Bardot.'' The required attitude, he said, was
``serious, deadly serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Very kitten with a whip, if you ask me. And it was much more
information than I could process, especially when he described the
``two-part hitch-in-the-step elephant walk'' that would result from
the correct wearing of stiletto heels.
</P>
<P>
   I am no Bardot, not even on a good day in dim light, and no way
was I going for the stilettos. But at least I could find something
black. Or as Hansen said, when I asked her what color lingerie
sells best at Lane Bryant, ``any color but white.'' (White, plus
heft, equals the ``sturdy Russian peasant bathing at the Black
Sea'' look, which American men for some reason don't find all that
attractive.)
</P>
<P>
   Backstage at the Lane Bryant show I caught up with Kathy Najimy,
a star of the television show ``Veronica's Closet'' and a
spokeswoman for Lane Bryant. She was wearing a black negligee with
plenty of push-up support, and she looked fabulous, like Barbra
Streisand after a couple of months touring the pastry shops of
Vienna. I asked her if the lingerie gave her confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the confidence first,'' she said. ``Then you choose
the clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   That seemed like a lot of confidence to me: Hundreds of people
were out in the audience, some with cameras near the runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of acting parts,'' she said. ``I'm just acting
like a supermodel. I do that at home all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dan Finnerty, Najimy's husband, standing nearby, nodded. ``We
have a runway in our living room,'' he said. He had the look of a
man who was happy with his lot in life. ``And she's a wonderful
kisser.''
</P>
<P>
   As a photographer took a shot of Najimy, I asked which side was
her best. ``Front,'' she said. This is a brave woman.
</P>
<P>
   And so I went out and brushed aside the proffered drinks. As far
as I was concerned, it was the models who needed the drinks, not
the audience. There, around the runway, were photographers armed
with 2-foot telephoto lenses. They were loaded for bear, or at
least a good shot of Anna Nicole Smith's cleavage.
</P>
<P>
   After much to-ing and fro-ing among the public relations people
about whether Glamour and Allure had the right seats, I was shown
to a place right on the runway. Seating was tight. (As a person
near me said, ``If all of these people actually needed to wear Lane
Bryant, they wouldn't be able to fit us in.'') Next to me was Rikki
Lake, who was there, she said, to support her friend Najimy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked me to model,'' Lake said, ``but I wouldn't go up
there. I'm too dissatisfied with my body, and I'm a Size 10!''
</P>
<P>
   The hysterically screaming crowd cheered Smith Mia Tyler and
others in the Size 14 (and up) supermodel category. These women
were, for the most part, Amazons with great hair and full body
makeup. They were big, but they had rock-hard thighs and wide,
solid hips. It wouldn't have been unthinkable for some to have been
carrying javelins.
</P>
<P>
   But were they sexy? You bet. They had parts that jiggled. There
were parts that swayed to the booming soundtrack. Some parts sort
of overlapped other parts. There were folds where the beauty
magazines say you aren't supposed to have them. The cartoonist
Cathy Guisewite could have easily drawn the women's squiggly
torsos. And what with the cheers and yells, there were moments when
it seemed as if we might all be at Sammy's Bowery Follies. There
were generous proportions all round, and some women had stretch
marks.
</P>
<P>
   But you know what? The women were an eyeful. They were brave,
fearless, powerful and gorgeous.
</P>
<P>
   When they stalked down the runway in their see-through plastic
mules, they were a symphony of moving, swaying parts in lingerie
that was clingy and often transparent. The effect was strangely
intimate, as if these women might really wait at home for some guy,
behind Door No. 3. A lucky guy might actually enjoy an evening with
one of them, one who could happily parade around in a pink feathery
bra and thongs, then plop down and enjoy a couple of cheese
burritos and a beer. Later, maybe a little leg wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   And you know what? If they can do it, I can do it.
</P>
<P>
   After all, what lingerie ultimately says to men is, ``I'm
ready.'' And ladies, Lane Bryant's black Sheer Passion under-wire
bra comes in Sizes 38B to 44DD, with matching thong and garter.

   WASHINGTON _ After just 13 months on Capitol Hill, Sen. John
Edwards is commanding the kind of attention veteran politicians
crave.
</P>
<P>

   ``I don't take any of it very seriously,'' he said in an
interview. ``It really just doesn't have much effect one way or the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the gushing predictions and glowing reviews could be a
challenge for the former attorney from Raleigh, especially when the
latest issue of Washingtonian magazine refers to him as ``the
Senate's number one heartthrob.''
</P>
<P>
   The city magazine, best known for its lifestyle features, put
Edwards on its list of ``early picks'' for presidential candidates
in 2008, praising him as ``smart as well as charming and strikingly
handsome.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine predicted a bright future for Edwards ``if he can
break a state jinx when he faces re-election in 2004.'' His North
Carolina Senate seat has been a ``one-term'' spot since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards won the seat in 1998, narrowly defeating Sen. Lauch
Faircloth, a Republican who defeated Sen. Terry Sanford in 1992,
who defeated Sen. Jim Broyhill in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The race was the first political foray for Edwards, 46, who made
millions of dollars representing plaintiffs in personal injury
cases, many of them involving children.
</P>
<P>
   In his first year in Congress, he was one of three Democratic
senators tapped to preside over the depositions of key witnesses in
President Clinton's impeachment trial. Edwards proved his expertise
in law and diplomacy, Democratic colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of 1999 continued in what Edwards called a
``fascinating'' and ``challenging'' time as Congress dealt with a
series of unexpected events such as the U.S. military intervention
in Kosovo and a devastating flood in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten my feet and all of me deep in the water very
quickly,'' he said. ``In a year, I've learned an awful lot. I've
gotten very battle-tested.''
</P>
<P>
   According to his fellow Democrats, the freshman lawmaker played
key roles in debates over managed care and the Y2K bug, and became
quickly known for his oratory skills, which are often described as
``folksy.''
</P>
<P>
   Many believe he will play an important role in the Senate as a
fiscally conservative centrist, and some speculate that he may be
on track to become chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, responsible for helping to elect Democrats to the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   A recent article in the Capitol Hill political newspaper Roll
Call named Edwards as a future Democratic leader in the Senate,
along with his jogging buddy, Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Ind., who has the
added distinction of making People magazine's ``50 most beautiful
people'' list.
</P>
<P>
   But Edwards will not discuss whether he has been approached
about leadership posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just would rather not talk about that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats lavish praise on Edwards, Republicans are ready
with some criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Gurley, political director for the North Carolina Republican
Party, has said that Edwards ``lacks muscle'' and has been
presenting himself ``in a flashy, style-conscious manner.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Edwards' relationship with the White House is not
exactly perfect. He has strongly opposed Clinton on the federal
lawsuit against tobacco companies and on tobacco tax proposals.
However, Edwards defended Clinton last year amid accusations that
the White House was dragging its feet on flood aid for North
Carolina and other states hit hard by Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``My relationship with the White House I would describe as a
working relationship,'' he said. ``When there are things that the
White House can help us with, ... I do whatever is necessary to put
pressure on the White House, and I think they've generally been
responsive to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike at least 122 Democratic members of Congress, Edwards
hasn't pledged his support to Vice President Al Gore's presidential
bid. Edwards said he plans to announce his presidential choice, but
``I don't know when.''
</P>
<P>
   On a personal front, the senator and his wife of 22 years,
Elizabeth, are expecting their fourth child in June. A son, Wade,
died in 1996 in a car accident at the age of 16.
</P>
<P>
   The Edwardses have recently purchased a $2.2 million D.C.
residence. The red brick Georgian-style home is located near the
the vice president's gated estate and will be decorated with
furniture and art work from North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The couple plan to keep their home in Raleigh and go back
``whenever we have recesses or breaks,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our home is in North Carolina. It will never be in Washington,
D.C.,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   With a new home, a new baby on the way and a promising political
career, even critics couldn't deny that the senator is on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   But he might.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh. I don't know. I wouldn't say it that way,'' he said. ``I
think there's no question that I've been blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   And as far as the buzz surrounding him lately, Edwards says he
tries not to pay much attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like a celebrity. I can tell you that,'' he said.

GARDENING: NOT ALL VIOLETS SHRINK FROM AMERICAN CLIMATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Feb. 6)  
(EDS: Optional sidebar at end.) 
(bl) 
 By CASS PETERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In England, where violets grow so willingly that gardeners can
afford to be snooty about varieties, dog violets are about as
welcome as curs at an American Kennel Club show.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose if I could cultivate lush beds of English sweet
violets, Corsican violets and other scented and refined members of
the genus, I'd turn up my nose at dog violets, too.
</P>
<P>
   But I can't, so I don't. I like my dog violets. I have a
thriving colony nestled at the base of a line of arborvitae and a
few clumps growing against the back wall of the garage, where it is
shady most of the day and a rusted-out gutter guarantees a little
extra moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Dog violets (not to be confused with dogtooth violets, which are
not violets at all and are more accurately called trout lilies) are
better on this side of the pond, anyway. In England, dog violet is
the name used for Viola canina, a short, small-flowered native
violet, which can be invasive and has no fragrance. Dog violet in
North America means Viola conspersa, which is taller (8 inches in
flower, instead of the British version's 3 inches) and has larger
and more abundant blooms.
</P>
<P>
   V. conspersa is a wildflower common in damp meadows throughout
the Northeast. It has no more fragrance than the English dog
violet, and it, too, tends to meander outside its assigned space.
Its saving grace is that it will grow in my south-central
Pennsylvania garden, far from the North Atlantic Current or
whatever it is that keeps England's weather cool, moist and
suitable for raising violets.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the violet family is more often
represented in gardens by the rugged cousins, violas and pansies.
These are usually grown as annual bedding plants, rather than as
perennials, which they are (or would be, given a climate like
England's). My pansies persist from autumn through the following
spring, sometimes blooming straight through if the winter is mild.
After that, they tend to die out, leaving behind only a few
volunteers that sprout from seed.
</P>
<P>
   Violas, which have smaller flowers than pansies but more of
them, sometimes hang on for two or three years in the same bed.
Johnny-jump-ups, the European wild pansy that has become
naturalized in North America, will often establish itself
permanently in places where it can grow undisturbed _ like under
the fuel tank or in the crevices at the base of a stone wall.
</P>
<P>
   True violets are perennials. They spread by underground runners
and will quickly form dense colonies if grown in the rich, moist
soil and semi-shady areas that most varieties prefer. They're
treasured for their early spring flowers, which are usually the
rich purple that is named after them, but they can also be rose,
lilac, white or bicolor. Many varieties are sweetly scented.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers appear for only a few weeks, usually beginning in
late March in my garden, but most varieties have attractive
foliage. The leaves are deep green, typically heart shape, and grow
no more than about 8 inches tall.
</P>
<P>
   An exception is bird's-foot violet (V. pedata), which has deeply
cut leaves that look, well, like a bird's foot. Bird's-foot violet
is a little more tolerant of dry areas than most violets. It is
also one of the most beautiful varieties, especially the bicolor
variant, with its two dark purple petals and three pale lavender
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Greek mythology holds that Zeus created violets as food for his
beloved Io when he turned her into a heifer to protect her from the
jealous wrath of his wife, Hera. What Io thought of her diet is not
recorded, but both the flowers and leaves of the violet are edible.
The leaves are particularly rich in vitamin C.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers are candied for use as garnish, but can be eaten raw
in salads or used to flavor jelly and syrup. Medicinally, violet
syrup was once a favored remedy for pleurisy and other lung
problems, and the flowers were also used to treat hangovers.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, we'd eat more violet salads and slurp up more violet
syrup if true violets weren't so tricky to grow in most American
gardens. In addition to constant moisture and protection from
extremes of heat and cold, they need high levels of fertility and
must be divided at least every other year. Overcrowding reduces the
number of blooms and makes the plants susceptible to fungal
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   But if you have a spot that seems likely to make violets happy,
they are a delightful addition to the garden. They are especially
beautiful planted with spring-flowering bulbs, like red and white
tulips.
</P>
<P>
   It is best to start with plants. Violets are difficult to
germinate and slow to grow from seed. Once you have a robust clump
going, you can divide it (every year, if you like) to increase your
planting. White Flower Farm (PO Box 50, Litchfield, Conn. 06759;
800-503-9624; free catalog) and Willow Pond Nursery (PO Box 192,
Hewlett, N.Y. 11557; 516-374-2522, catalog, $2) have nice
selections of perennial violets, although, like most nurseries,
they do not deign to carry dog violets.
</P>
<P>
   Scented violets would be lovely, of course, but I am content
with the less-demanding habits of dog violets.
</P>
<P>
   Come spring, I intend to plant a few more clumps of them under
the edge of the deck, which is about two feet off the ground. I
think they will be comfortable there in the half-shade cast by the
deck boards and that they will creep out beyond the overhang far
enough for me to mow around the deck without having to do trim-up
work under its edge. An obliging plant is its own pedigree.

   &UR; THIS WEEK: FILL FEEDER, HUNT INSECTS, CUT AMARYLLIS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By PATRICIA JONAS &LR;  &QC;   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the supply of fruits and berries dwindles and seeds become
buried under the snow, it is important to keep bird feeders full
and water available. A mix of black oil sunflower seeds and white
proso millet will be the most appealing to the largest variety of
birds and a good source of protein and fat.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt for overwintering insects. Inspect small branches on
deciduous trees, and prune out any with shiny bands of tent
caterpillar eggs. Clip off the distinctive twiggy cocoons that
bagworms have hung from juniper branches. Look for waxy white egg
masses of woolly adelgid on hemlocks, and spray with horticultural
oil when temperatures are above freezing. Do not disturb
parchment-color, walnut-size egg cases attached to twigs: in early
spring, praying mantises will hatch from these by the hundreds to
feed on any insect pests that make it through winter. They eat
larger and larger insects as they grow (including each other).
</P>
<P>
   When flowers of holiday amaryllis plants have faded, cut back
the flower stalk at its base near the top of the bulb. Continue to
water and feed to encourage the growth of new leaves and the
development of a healthy plant, which will store nutrients for next
year's flowers.

UNIONS FIND IT HARD TO GET 1ST CONTRACT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Winning a union election, in some ways, is one of the
easier things a union can do. Getting an initial contract can be
much trickier.
</P>
<P>
   Companies cannot only contest an election by arguing about which
employees should be in the bargaining unit, they can also draw out
negotiations on an initial contract for years. They can file
objections and then go round and round about controversial
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The process of going from an election victory to a first
contract can drag on for years, said Ruth E. Small, resident
officer of the National Labor Relations Board in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Small has had one case on her desk since 1985 that has gone back
and forth to the NLRB in Washington on hearings and appeals because
the company has been arguing over which employees belong in the
bargaining unit. The matter will probably wind up in court, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting an initial contract is such a problem that one local
union leader said he won't organize a union if he thinks the union
can't get a contract from an employer.
</P>
<P>
   Why put people through getting threatened, spied on and fired if
there is little chance of obtaining that first contract, said Orell
Fitzsimmons, state director of the Service Employees International
Union Local 100 in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   If a company wants to fight, it's really hard on the union
because a company never has to sign a contract, he said. All the
law says is that a company has to bargain in good faith, said
Fitzsimmons, who has sat through hours of discussion over who will
talk first and who will attend the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzsimmons said he felt he had a good chance when he organized
Head Start employees in Houston because public pressure could be
brought to bear to force the organization to bargain with
employees. His hunch was right. The union got its contract in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BILL SEEKS TO GET QUICK AGREEMENT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To try to force companies into serious negotiations shortly
after an election, Rep. Gene Green, D-Texas, has introduced the
Labor Relations First Contract Negotiations Act.
</P>
<P>
   The bill requires mediation if an employer and newly elected
union representatives have not agreed to a contract in 60 days. If
the company and union fail to sign a contract after an additional
30 days, the remaining issues are transferred to the Federal
Mediation and Conciliation Service for binding arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   The freedom to organize a union is part of our free enterprise
system, said Green. But because of company delaying, some employees
are ultimately denied the right to bargain collectively.
</P>
<P>
   Green said it's a pattern he sees around the country. He feels
there needs to be a way to shorten the process. Filing unfair labor
practice charges isn't an effective weapon, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Green has failed to get very far with his bill. In fact, he
can't even get a hearing on it. He has been looking for bills
coming to the House floor that he could attach his plan to as an
amendment. But there hasn't been a lot of favorable labor-related
legislation, he said. Unlike the Senate, the House requires an
amendment to be relevant to the initial legislation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SIXTY-DAY PROPOSAL DECRIED &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure how you can do it in 60 days,'' said Kerry
Notestine, an employment lawyer at Littler Mendelson in Houston who
represents companies that are involved in union negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of territory to cover in new contracts and it
would require practically non-stop bargaining to put together a 20-
to 30-page contract in 60 days, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, unions already have the remedy of filing complaints
when they believe employers aren't bargaining in good faith,
Notestine said. Green's bill may be unnecessary government
intrusion between a company and union, he added.
</P>
<P>
   A former employee of the Gallup Poll organization in Houston
said she would like to see Green's bill passed because it's hard
for a union to keep up the struggle for an initial contract when it
goes on for years.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling efforts to organize a union at the polling company,
she said that in the long, drawn-out, back-and-forth that ensued,
several people lost interest. Others became so frustrated that they
left the company for other jobs. Still others were fired.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fired employees have received a favorable ruling
from the National Labor Relations Board, which believes that they
were fired illegally, Gallup is appealing.

 &HT;    FRESHMAN N.C. SENATOR SHRUGS OFF GLOWING REVIEWS
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After just 13 months on Capitol Hill, Sen. John
Edwards is commanding the kind of attention veteran politicians
crave.
</P>
<P>
   The freshman senator from North Carolina is popping up on all
sorts of interesting lists _ future Democratic Party leaders, best
orators in Congress and the latest _ in a glossy D.C. monthly
magazine _ possible presidential candidates in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   All the attention could be daunting for some and intoxicating
for others, but Edwards says it's not important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take any of it very seriously,'' he said in an

USING TWO CD-ROMS REQUIRES SOUND CARD WITH AUXILIARY PLUG 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I recently added a rewriteable CD-ROM drive to my computer.
This gives me two CD-ROM drives. The salesman who sold it to me
told me I could use it the same way I use my current CD-ROM drive,
but I've run into two problems. First, I can't play music CDs in
it. No sound! Then, I installed some software that came on CD in
that drive, and now I find I must use that drive whenever I use
that particular program. It won't work if the disc is in the other
drive. Why am I having these problems? Did the salesman lie to me?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, the salesman didn't lie. But he didn't tell you
everything, either.
</P>
<P>
   When you install a regular CD-ROM drive, there are usually three
cables you must connect. The first is a wide, flat ribbon cable
that carries data from the drive to the rest of the computer. Next
is the power cable. The third is a narrow cable with small
connectors that also plugs into your sound card. It is used
exclusively to get sound from music CDs _ called red book audio _
to the sound card.
</P>
<P>
   (Note that if your audio adapter is built into the computer's
system board, this small cable will plug into there instead.)
</P>
<P>
   When you install a second CD-ROM drive, you must also install
the sound card cable, or you won't be able to hear music CDs, or
the audio on some older multimedia titles that used red book audio.
The problem is that many audio cards have only one place to plug in
these cables. Unless you upgrade to a card with an auxiliary plug,
or can find or build some kind of adapter cable, you'll have to
make do with just one drive that can play music CDs.
</P>
<P>
   The issue with the software is a different problem.
</P>
<P>
   Some software titles install components on your hard drive, but
still need information from a CD to run. When you install one of
these programs to your drive, it makes a note in its settings which
CD-ROM drive was used in the installation process and presumes that
is where it can look for the data it needs when launched. If you
put the disk into the other drive, the program can't find it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My son sends me pictures of our grandchildren all the time,
and when I click on them in Windows 98 they launch either the Web
browser or some kind of viewer program. This takes a long time. Is
there some other way I can look at these pictures that's faster?
</P>
<P>
   A: Provided the files are simple JPG or GIF format images, there
are two ways you can see them quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The first is to set up the Windows 98 folders to be viewed as
Web pages. Save the attachments to a specific folder, then use My
Computer to get to it. If you've got Windows 98 set up so
double-clicking launches programs, then click once on the file and
a thumbnail version of it will appear in a pane on the left of the
folder. If you have Windows 98 set up to launch with single clicks,
simply hold the mouse cursor over the file for a second or two to
make the thumbnail appear.
</P>
<P>
   You can also use a feature called QuickView to get a better look
at the file. Right-click on the picture you want to look at and
choose QuickView from the menu that appears.
</P>
<P>
   If QuickView is not in the menu, you'll need to install it. Go
to Add/Remove Programs in the Windows control panel and click on
the Windows Setup tab. Click on Accessories, then the Details
button. Click QuickView so its box is checked, then click OK. You
may need your Windows 98 disk, or you may need to point to Windows
98 setup files that reside in the windowsoptions folder on some
PCs.

REPUBLICANS PLAY CATCH-UP AS PARTIES PREPARE FOR REDISTRICTING 
</HEADLINE>

Washington Bureau of the New York Times Regional Newspapers)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a tacit acknowledgment that Democrats have _ so
far _ done a better job of preparing for the political
redistricting that will follow this year's census, Republicans are
launching a new multi-million-dollar initiative aimed at increasing
their ranks in state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   The new Republican Legislative Campaign Fund will commit party
money and resources to electing more GOP state legislators this
November on the presumption they could help the party when it comes
time to draw new congressional and legislative district lines for
2002 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, the 2000 state elections will be a hidden
national election because the results could help determine whether
Republicans will be the majority party in Congress and state
legislative chambers for the next decade,'' said Jim Nicholson,
chairman of the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In the South, Republicans have reason to be worried. Despite
substantial election gains over the past decade, Republicans remain
the minority party in most Southern statehouses.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Democrats currently control the governor's office and
state legislatures in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, and North
Carolina. The power is shared in Louisiana and South Carolina,
while Florida and Virginia are totally GOP-controlled.
</P>
<P>
   And while there is an open-seat race for governor in North
Carolina this year, the governor there doesn't have any veto-power
over redistricting, diminishing his influence in that process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats are in the driver's seat,'' boasted Kevin Mack,
executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans worry that their party hasn't done enough to
change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize that the Democrats ... are five years ahead of us
in pursuing a strong elective strategy,'' Wes Marsh, president of
the National Republican Legislators Association, wrote in a letter
to supporters this past fall.
</P>
<P>
   ALL THINGS IN MODERATION
</P>
<P>
   They are calling themselves the Mod Squad. As in moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Nine Senate Democrats who consider themselves outside the more
liberal wing of their caucus are joining forces to try to push the
party's Senate agenda toward the center.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., the new group includes
John Breaux and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, John Edwards of North
Carolina, Chuck Robb of Virginia, Blanche Lambert-Lincoln of
Arkansas, Evan Bayh of Indiana, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Joe
Lieberman of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The group met with Democratic Leader Tom Daschle to get across
their message that this year's session could be more productive if
the party adopts a consensus approach rather than leaning left. But
there are bound to be some disagreements within the group itself
considering that Breaux and Kerry are pushing a Medicare reform
plan opposed by most Dems.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their name, the senators probably won't be doing much
undercover police work like Pete, Linc and Julie, the hip stars of
the original 60s television crime show.
</P>
<P>
   CRITICAL CARE
</P>
<P>
   All is not well when it comes to health care for black
Americans, and some lawmakers want to change that.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Black Caucus is calling for a new National
Center for Research on Minority Health and Health Disparities, part
of its ``Fair Care'' legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Minority groups suffer disproportionately from cancer, AIDS,
stroke, heart disease, diabetes and other serious health problems,
according to medical findings.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the disparities, the bill's sponsors
believe, is insensitivity of doctors and a lack of health resources
for minorities. Currently, only a fraction of a percent of NIH
funding goes toward research on African-Americans, caucus members
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress needs to take steps to ensure that all Americans
receive fair and equitable medical decisions and treatments,'' said
Rep. William Jefferson, D-La.
</P>
<P>
   FIRED UP
</P>
<P>
   Southern lawmakers, Democrats and Republicans, have lined up to
shoot down President Clinton's latest proposal for stricter
gun-control laws.
</P>
<P>
   While there are a few exceptions, most area lawmakers seem cool
to the new proposed licensing and registration requirements for
handgun purchases that Clinton outlined in his recent State of the
Union address.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be reluctant to support that,'' said Rep. Allen Boyd,
D-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to do anything to infringe on somebody's right
to bear arms,'' said Rep. Mike McIntyre, D-N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., questioned the need for new
gun-control measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we enforce the laws that are on the books now, that would
take care of the problem,'' Coble said.

PRESARIO IS SNAZZY AND DESKPRO SOLID 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In an attempt to jump-start its business and restore
its design edge, Compaq Computer Corp. has been chasing the mantra
of ``cool products.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houston PC maker, which built its early reputation on
engineering and design skills, has shaken off the doldrums and
begun to churn out some unusual machines.
</P>
<P>
   But the company can still make plain vanilla when it wants to _
and when customers, particularly in the business sector, demand it.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at two different Compaqs _ one consumer system,
another for business _ that are typical of this yin and yang.
</P>
<P>
   _ Presario EZ 2200, $1,400: Let's get this out of the way first:
This is the coolest-looking consumer PC you can buy. This is the
way industrial designers of the 1930s and 1940s thought machines of
the future would appear _ streamlined, with neat visual touches
that also serve a useful function.
</P>
<P>
   The EZ 2200 comes in a rounded, purplish-blue case. Its two CD
drives _ one read-only, the other rewriteable _ and a floppy disk
drive are hidden behind a door on the front. The door also covers a
pair of Universal Serial Bus ports and an IEEE 1394 (a.k.a.
FireWire or iLink) port.
</P>
<P>
   Above the door is an oval LCD display panel called the Digital
Dashboard. Below the display is an on-off button. Above it is a
light indicating whether you have e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The back of the computer has a panel that pops off to allow
access to a pair of USB ports, an IEEE 1394 port, a monitor port,
speaker and microphone connections, the power plug and modem jacks.
Conspicuously absent are parallel, serial and PS/2 ports, making
this a ``legacy-free'' PC.
</P>
<P>
   The EZ 2000 comes with a 500-megahertz Intel Celeron processor,
64 megabytes of memory, a 17-gigabyte hard drive, a 56K fax modem
and the pair of CD drives. It borrows from the standard memory for
its video memory, between one and eight MB, depending on what's
needed. It also comes with an Internet keyboard bristling with
buttons. The model I tried included a 17-inch monitor and JBL Pro
Audio speakers.
</P>
<P>
   How all this comes together is what makes the system unique.
That on-off button works just as you always wanted an on-off button
to work on a PC _ it first shuts Windows down, then powers off the
computer ... sometimes. More on this in a moment.
</P>
<P>
   The Digital Dashboard displays a clock most of the time when the
PC is on. But it will also alert you to what the computer is doing.
For example, if you add hardware, it displays ``Device Added'' when
the installation is successful.
</P>
<P>
   The side panels pop off to make the system easy to upgrade. You
can quickly get to the Presario's expansion slots, memory and hard
drive this way.
</P>
<P>
   While all this sounds cool, there are drawbacks. First, sharing
video memory with main system memory is bad news, particularly if
you play graphically demanding games. When it needs the full eight
MB, the system itself is left with only 56 MB to work with. This
can result in sluggish performance.
</P>
<P>
   I also had a problem with the shutdown feature. After the PC ran
for a while, it would either lock up at shutdown or restart
instead. Turning off all the background programs, fiddling with the
hardware settings and even installing a newer version of the
operating system didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   I also saw this happen on another EZ 2200 at a demonstration on
Compaq's Houston campus. A Compaq spokeswoman said this was not a
problem with every computer, but only with a certain production
lot.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you're interested in buying one of these, you may
want to pay close attention to how it behaves when you try to turn
it off. Ask for a new unit if it starts misbehaving in this way.
</P>
<P>
   _ Deskpro EN Series Small Form Factor, $2,577: While this system
lacks the flash and dash of the EZ 2000, it's got to warm the
cockles of a system administrator's heart. It's lean, simple and
easy to open and upgrade _ despite the clunky name _ and blazingly
fast. It's also ready for Windows 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For those not schooled in the maddening jargon of the tech
world, ``small form factor'' means it comes in a small case. It
takes up about two-thirds the space of a standard desktop unit, but
still has adequate expansion capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The model I tried had a 733-MHz Pentium III chip, 128 MB of
memory, a 20-GB hard drive, a 10/100-megabit Ethernet card, 16-bit
sound and a built-in speaker, a Matrox Millennium G400 graphics
adapter with 16 MB of video memory and a 6X DVD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a legacy-free system, so it has parallel and serial
ports, as well as a pair of USB connections.
</P>
<P>
   The computer came with Windows 98, although Window 95, NT 4.0
and Windows 2000 _ the next version of NT _ are available. I
installed Windows 2000, and it was nearly painless. The new
operating system didn't have drivers for this Millennium card,
which I had to grab from Matrox's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Getting into the small case is a snap. A simple set of latches
allows you to pull the case off the main chassis. The drive cage
tilts out, making it easy to replace the drives. The main system
board slides easily out of the chassis.
</P>
<P>
   The small case, though, does have its drawbacks. It has just two
expansion slots _ one PCI and one PCI/ISA combination. Depending on
how you configure a system, though, either or both could be in use.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of the Deskpro EN was excellent, with either
Windows 98 or 2000. It's aimed at businesses, so it's available
mainly through Compaq's reseller. That's too bad, because I suspect
there are quite a few savvy home users who'd love to get their
hands on a system like this one.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a recent sub-Arctic Tuesday night, an army of
bundled-up New Yorkers filled the Chelsea nightclub Centro-Fly for
a party celebrating the long-awaited release of D'Angelo's album
``Voodoo.''
</P>
<P>
   The club was packed and sweaty, with decor and soul music out of
a 1970s time warp: multiple video screens playing images of Curtis
Mayfield and vintage ``Soul Train'' episodes, replete with dancers
in Day-Glo bell-bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   But the buzz all around the steamy party was about a
spanking-new video playing on one of the monitors. There are no
retro-looking '70s clothes in this clip. There are, in fact, no
clothes at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Video,'' as it's fast becoming known, is the hugely
suggestive clip for D'Angelo's latest single ``Untitled (How Does
It Feel).'' The most controversial music video to air in years, it
depicts the muscular, cornrowed singer, adorned only in a crucifix
necklace, belting out a love song in a soulful falsetto reminiscent
of Marvin Gaye and Prince.
</P>
<P>
   The entire video consists of one long, leering shot in which the
camera focuses first on D'Angelo's lips, then swings down to catch
the sweat trickling from his tattooed arms, chiseled chest and
abdominal muscles, finally flirting with a peak of shadowed,
muscular hip. These images of a powerful, objectified male body
have sparked diverging opinions among music fans.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the response to the video has been divided
largely along sexual lines. Most women watch and swoon; many men
turn away and scowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so sexy,'' said Danyel Smith, the former editor in chief
of Vibe, now an editor at large for Time Inc. ``It's about time
that girls had something luscious to look at while they're
listening to a song. For years, men have been treated to breasts
and butts along with their favorite songs, and women have had to
just sit there and endure.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``Untitled'' breaks a long-established pattern in
hip-hop and R&AMP;B videos in which male artists are often dressed in
roughneck gear _ baggy jeans, Timberland boots and baseball caps _
surrounded by shimmying women in thong bikinis.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are definitely talking about the video _ it's all I
hear,'' said Tracy Cloherty, program director at WQHT-FM, Hot 97.
On Tuesday night, D'Angelo was live in the Hot 97 studio while the
DJs Angie Martinez and Funkmaster Flex fielded calls from listeners
about the video.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, most of the women loved it,'' Cloherty said later.
``Some of the men said things like: `We don't wanna see that kind
of stuff. Why do we have to look at (italics)that?'(end italics)
Men definitely seem to be threatened by male nudity.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by this video buzz, D'Angelo's ``Voodoo,'' the follow-up
to his multiplatinum 1995 debut ``Brown Sugar,'' rocketed to No. 1
on the current Billboard album chart, selling 320,000 copies in its
first week.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Untitled'' video is now in heavy rotation on MTV, and is
the No. 1 video on BET. That network recently aired a parody video,
featuring a lanky comedian, whose muscular development is, well,
less Tyson Beckford than Jimmy Walker.
</P>
<P>
   D'Angelo, in a phone interview, said he was aware of the
controversy, but had really not heard anything directly negative
from his male fans. ``With men, if there's any negative reaction,
I'm not really going to get an honest feedback,'' said the
soft-spoken 25-year-old singer from Richmond, Va., whose vocal
style and songwriting is often compared to that of classic soul men
like Al Green and Eddie Kendricks. ``The women love it, most
definitely. But for me personally, the response I've got from both
men and women has been pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, at the ``Voodoo'' release party, some people were more
outspoken. One young woman recalled sitting at home, staring at the
video, while her boyfriend snapped, ``Turn the channel _ I don't
want to see that gay stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvet Britto, president of the Britto Agency, a public
relations firm that represents sports and entertainment figures,
said men who were threatened by the male sexuality of the video
were ``player haters,'' meaning jealous of others' success. ``They
just wish they looked so good,'' Britto said. ``D'Angelo showed us
muscles in that video most women didn't know men could have.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But is this discomfort among male viewers simply a case of
pec-and-ab envy? Some men said they were turned off by the vanity
of the clip. ``It's a good song, but I thought he was preening
pretty heavily in the video,'' said David Thigpen, a music writer
for Time. ``Frankly, it looks like he's trying to one-up Alanis
Morissette,'' he said, referring to a video from Morissette's last
album, where she belts out thank-yous to the whole world, while
riding on a crowded subway train, naked as Lady Godiva.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nakedness is usually an expression of vulnerability _ that was
the point of the Alanis Morissette video,'' Thigpen said. ``But in
this case, it's really about power, an in-your-face form of
masculinity.''
</P>
<P>
   Male nudity in popular music is nothing new, of course. White
artists like Iggy Pop and the Red Hot Chili Peppers have strutted
the stage nude or nearly nude, and tough-guy rappers like Treach
and LL Cool J have long flaunted their pumped-up torsos in music
videos. But the nakedness of the D'Angelo video seems to be tapping
into something a little more unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's objectifying himself and selling his own sexuality,''
Britto noted. ``It's reminiscent of someone like Madonna.'' Perhaps
it's this fear of male objectification that has touched a strain of
homophobia in the hip-hop community, where it's common to hear
epithets for gay men used as synonyms for weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Smith of Time Inc. said that among women, she had encountered an
appreciative reaction to the adult sexuality of the D'Angelo video,
which was unlike the squealing of teen-agers to the Backstreet
Boys. ``Last week, I was at the hair salon, which is always a
bustle of activity, people hollering for hair dye,'' Smith
recalled. ``BET and MTV are on all day long with no one paying too
much attention, but when that video came on, you could've heard a
bobby pin drop. All the women just watched in silence, and when the
video was over, there was a collective sigh of `Oh my God! He is
beautiful!'''
</P>
<P>
   Star Jones, co-host of ``The View'' on ABC, commented:
``D'Angelo is singing about being intimate with a woman that he
loves, and it's just basic voice and body, and when you're in an
intimate situation with a man, that's really all that's there _ the
voice and the body and the light hitting the body in a way that
makes you know that this is your man.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Trenier, D'Angelo's manager, who conceived the video,
said: ``We didn't want an on-screen love interest. We wanted him to
be able to make contact with whoever was watching it one-on-one.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Angelo himself said he was initially cool to the concept. ``I
was skeptical at first when Dom came to me. I was like, `Yeah, is
this really gonna work?' But when I got there to do it, I felt
pretty comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Trenier added: ``Men have given it a slant that they can't look
at the video, but if you sit in a roomful of women for a while,
they'll eventually just beat you down, express to you how much you
should go work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up one more reason for the ``player haters'' to
despise D'Angelo. Though he does work out, he claims not to be
fanatical. ``No,'' he said, in answer to an obvious question,
``that's just my natural build. Right before the video I did, like,
one little session in the gym.''

<P>
   In theory, anyone can grow up to be president. In practice, the
next president is going to be a graduate of Harvard, Yale,
Princeton or the Naval Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are he will also be a graduate of either St. Albans
School or Phillips Academy Andover. He will be either the son of a
senator, the son of a president and grandson of a senator, the son
and grandson of an admiral, or -- the humblest background and
longest shot in the group -- the son of a Midwestern banker.
</P>
<P>
   Given the small slice of the population these privileged
backgrounds represent, we have here a spectacular breakdown in the
law of averages. Either that or an interesting perspective on
American society.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, you don't have to be an aristo to become president.
For one thing, George W. Bush is the only full blue blood in the
lot. For another, poor white trash defeated Andover-and-Yale Sr.
eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But even in supposedly class-bound Britain it would be
considered shocking if the two politicians battling for the top job
both had attended hoity private schools.
</P>
<P>
   For decades now we've been hearing about the decline or death of
the Protestant Establishment (or the Episcopacy or the WASP
Ascendancy or just the Upper Class). In fact, in America we're not
supposed to have had an inherited class system. Even left-wing
critiques of power in American society tend to emphasize the role
of money, not bloodlines.
</P>
<P>
   What is supposed to have replaced the Protestant Establishment
is something called meritocracy. Enthusiasts celebrate meritocracy
as the perfect human-resources policy for democracy and capitalism:
a system in which everyone has equal opportunity to thrive based on
his or her own talents and efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics, such as Nicholas Lemann in his current book ``The Big
Test,'' see an aristocracy of bloodlines being replaced by an
aristocracy of test scores. Even meritocracy is already dead,
according to many social critics, mainly conservative. They mourn
that meritocracy was killed by affirmative action and political
correctness, and succeeded by a social order based on government
fiat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it seems that bloodlines remain remarkably powerful, even in
a political culture where denunciation of ``elites'' is as routine
as ``God bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just in politics. Even at the cutting edge of the
economy, the place where everything is new, where success can
strike anyone and failure can too, where capitalism sorts and sifts
with blind efficiency, where what you do matters and where you're
from doesn't, and blah blah blah -- in cyberspace, that is -- the
law of averages seems to have broken down.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s I was a ``tutor'' (precious term for resident
adviser) in a ``house'' (dormitory) at Harvard. Scott McNealy was
there. Now, as founder and CEO of Sun Microsystems, he is one of
the biggest cyberbigshots.
</P>
<P>
   George Bell was there too, and he's now also a cyberbigshot, CEO
of Excite(at)home, the Web portal and cable access company.
</P>
<P>
   The other day I was trying to remember the name of that woman
who got hired as CEO of eBay, the auction site, and almost
immediately became an IPO billionaire. Was it something like ``Meg
Whitman''?
</P>
<P>
   No, that was Ann Whitman's sister who dated that pre-med guy
from Kirkland House and went to Harvard Business School, then moved
to San Francisco, and oh my gosh!
</P>
<P>
   Steve Ballmer, now CEO of Microsoft (and therefore my boss), was
not in K-House but had friends there and was around a lot. Bill
Gates? Maybe he was around too. Who noticed?
</P>
<P>
   All this future royalty of cyberspace in one dorm at one
university. Coincidence? Or is there some other explanation?
</P>
<P>
   Like almost all dorms at all universities back then -- and
unlike almost all dorms at all universities now -- Kirkland House
was definitely not a fertile culture of entrepreneurialism, let
alone of computer studies. So that's not the explanation.
</P>
<P>
   A Harvard education is good, but not that good. And to get into
Harvard you have to be reasonably bright, but you don't have to be
a genius. So those possible explanations don't wash either.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Harvard students, these folks did not stand out as
especially brilliant or promising. You would have liked them, found
them intelligent, and predicted happiness and success. But you
would not have predicted that they would be among the very top
leaders of a new economy that is transforming America.
</P>
<P>
   If these individuals have anything in common, beyond Kirkland
House, it's that they're from a group that was already a small
minority even at Harvard a generation ago: prep-school WASPs.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman and Bell are classic East Coast American blue bloods out
of Henry James or Edith Wharton: full members of the club. The
others only qualify for various levels of associate membership.
McNealy and Ballmer both attended private schools in Detroit, as
did Gates in Seattle. McNealy's father was an auto company CEO,
Gates' a prominent lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   As in politics, you don't need to be a blue blood to make it in
cyberspace. Silicon World probably is as wide open as anyplace in
history to talent and energy from any social background, ethnic
heritage, citizenship, table manners, or sanitary habits. This
isn't investment banking. That's what makes it so interesting that
bloodlines and elite institutions still seem to count.
</P>
<P>
   Money can't explain it. The WASP establishment no longer
dominates this country financially. None of the cyberpioneers comes
from a huge fortune. All four of the leading presidential
candidates are rich, but none is impressively rich by current
standards. Far richer men have tried using their own fortunes to
run for president, so far without success.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the notion of Ivy League universities as bastions of
bloodlines is half a century out of date. Harvard, Yale and
Princeton -- and the Naval Academy -- all claim to be loyal
servants of meritocracy now. And that's pretty much true.
</P>
<P>
   However, as it happens, each of the four top presidential
candidates had -- as a senator's son, an alumni son, an admiral's
son, or a star athlete -- a substantial exemption from the
meritocratic rigors of the admission process. So meritocracy can't
explain it either.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not money, and it's not merit in any conventional or at
least observable sense. I think it must be genuine moral
superiority. What other explanation could there be?

APPRENTICE HAIRDRESSER FOR THE DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Feb. 6)

 By ELIZABETH HAYT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When I was a girl my mother used to warn, ``If you
don't study and get good grades, you'll wind up in beauty school.''
I did study hard and graduated from an Ivy League college, followed
by an M.A. in art history. But last summer I found myself bent over
a black sink, a nozzle in one hand and a bottle of shampoo in the
other, washing a socialite's hair.
</P>
<P>
   My mother's fears had come true. I was a hairdresser's
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   It all began when my Madison Avenue stylist, Mark Garrison, was
offered a trip to Aspen, Colo., by one of his best clients, to give
her her regular $200 haircut. She is a Miami art collector and
philanthropist, and because she wears her hair short in a spiky,
Hilary Swank style, it must be cut every six weeks, including when
she is on vacation in the Rocky Mountains. She was flying in Mark,
all expenses paid, for one day. He asked me along for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Mark's client recruited a number of friends for makeovers, and
on a Sunday afternoon, he took over a local Aspen beauty shop as
the women, one by one, filed in. Without an assistant, he quickly
got backed up doing his own shampoos and blow-dries. I decided to
give him a hand, and Mark was only too glad to put me to work at
the sink.
</P>
<P>
   As teen-agers at slumber parties, my friends and I would stay up
all night straightening each other's hair. Back then, I was known
for my Vidal Sassoon touch. I wondered, Did I still have it?
</P>
<P>
   A bleached blonde in her 40s, dressed in a peach Chanel blouse,
plopped down in the shampoo chair without asking my name. This was
the norm, I learned, for clients dealing with the shampoo girl, the
lowest in the salon pecking order. As I lathered her hair, she
rambled about her vacation in the south of France, insisting that I
must see Cap d'Antibes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, right,'' I thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about a cool rinse at the end?'' I asked her.
</P>
<P>
   But no sooner had I turned on the faucet than my professional
posturing gave way to panic. Who knew you were supposed to hold the
nozzle down into the sink? Suddenly the hose snaked up, wildly
spraying water over the ceiling, the floor and my client's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haven't you ever done this before?'' she snarled, wiping the
mascara running down her cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   Being a shampoo girl wasn't as easy as it looked. A fancy
education means nothing if you can't control the water pressure.
Meanwhile, Mark was painting viscous hair color onto a brunette's
gray roots, when he spied another customer at the door. He handed
me the bowl of dye and said, ``Here, finish her up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't want the assistant to do this part!'' the woman in
the chair protested, eyeing me with distrust. I assured her it
didn't require a lot of skill to do a single-process coloring. To
myself, I said, ``It can't be any harder than basting a roast,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. Not only did I color the woman's hair, I managed to dye
her forehead, too. She looked like a minstrel from the nose up. I
tried scrubbing her face with a towel, which only turned her skin
bright red. Excusing myself as calmly as I could, I scurried over
to Mark and whispered that there was a small problem. ``Get some
Windex,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?''
</P>
<P>
   ``An inside secret. Just spray it on a cloth, wipe her face, and
the dye comes right off.''
</P>
<P>
   I finished the day on maid duty. If I thought being the shampoo
girl was humbling, it was a privilege compared to cleaning up
dirty, wet towels and dye-stained rubber gloves.
</P>
<P>
   I found out that the hairdresser's assistants, despite their
lowly status, are the key to any salon's operation. It's their job
to keep the head stylist on schedule and to pamper the customers,
remembering a favorite shampoo or product, whether a woman prefers
coffee or tea, and how she likes her hair done. A salon is like a
royal court, with assistants acting as courtiers to the king of
coiffure.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At Mark's New York salon, Wednesday night is class night, when
his staff practices on volunteers. It's an occasion to prove to the
boss you've got the skill and talent to be promoted to stylist,
which usually takes anywhere from one to two years. My Aspen
experience had piqued my interest in the business. In one
afternoon, Mark had earned a small fortune, about $2,000 from seven
customers, flying across the country to make a house call. Maybe I
could pad my income as a free-lance writer by moonlighting at his
salon.
</P>
<P>
   He encourages assistants on their days off to bring volunteers
in to practice cutting hair. Dressed in the salon uniform _ black
pants and a crisp white shirt with a pocket for tips _ I went to
the salon, on Madison near 69th Street, with the goal of recruiting
a model off the street. One of Mark's hairdressers was standing
outside, taking a break, and when I told her of my plan, a woman
standing nearby overheard us and offered to be my first customer.
</P>
<P>
   Before she had the chance to change her mind, I whisked her
upstairs. She was 33, a doctoral candidate in clinical psychology
named Julie Mora, with long, straight brown hair. After a shampoo,
I draped a towel around her shoulders. ``So, what are we going to
do today?'' I asked nonchalantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a trim,'' Julie said warily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I get a drink of water or something?'' she asked, sounding
irritated that I had forgotten the fundamentals of salon
hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the other assistants, I realized that providing
personal service is the key to their jobs. One assistant had pulled
Mark aside and was anxiously explaining to him that the pregnant
Mrs. So-and-So had just called. Her baby was overdue, she was
scheduled for a C-section later in the week and absolutely had to
get a haircut in time for the delivery. Yes, of course, she knew
that Mark was booked a month in advance. Wasn't there anything he
could do?
</P>
<P>
   It pays to know an assistant in high places. Like the courtier
who has the royal ear, the assistant can persuade the hairdresser
to squeeze in that special client.
</P>
<P>
   Ready to cut Julie's hair, I assumed the typical hairdresser
stance: feet apart, body slightly slouched, Elvis style. With each
snip, my confidence grew, and pretty soon, a fringe of hair lay at
my feet. I stepped back to study my work.
</P>
<P>
   Uh, oh! Either the floor was crooked or the right side of
Julie's hair was a good inch shorter than the left and the bottom
was as uneven as a picket fence. I knew that if I tried to
straighten out the mess, Julie's trim would turn into a pixie.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, one of Mark's assistants, a young Italian, came
over. Without a word, he took the scissors and in one swift
movement glided them across Julie's hair, making it perfectly
straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, look at you,'' Mark said, coming up behind. ``You
started out as an assistant and didn't even know which end of the
scissors to pick up, and now, you have your own assistant. You're a
natural, Elizabeth. You could be a top stylist in no time.'' I let
out a nervous laugh, fanning Julie's hair with a blow-dryer.
</P>
<P>
   ``All finished!'' I announced, handing her a mirror and spinning
the chair so she could check out her hair. ``What do you think?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks pretty good,'' she said. ``Usually my housekeeper
cuts it. Anything is better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   While she went into the dressing room to change, a few of Mark's
assistants gathered around me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did she tip you?'' one whispered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a $20 tip once for doing a shampoo,'' another said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got 50 cents yesterday,'' someone else said with a groan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually you get $5 for the shampoo and anywhere from $10 to
$20 for a cut,'' the first one said, reassuringly. ``A good sign of
how well you did your job is how well she tips you.''
</P>
<P>
   As Julie approached, the assistants scattered. ``I'm really
sorry, but I can't tip you,'' she said. ``I don't have any cash.
But I'll come back.''
</P>
<P>
   So I wound up getting stiffed. Vidal Sassoon I wasn't. But to my
surprise, a week later, Julie called the salon for a wash and
blow-dry. She booked an appointment with me.

A JAPANESE STAR TRIES ENGLISH  
 BACK TO THE ZOO  
 TAKING A CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: The lower-cased middle name in the final item is correct.)

 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Takeshi Kitano rested on a black canvas director's
chair on the top floor of an abandoned office building at the
eastern edge of downtown Los Angeles, his fingers intertwined atop
his Jellystone Park sweatshirt and his worn sandals resting on a
nearby equipment box. He leaned over and spoke quietly in Japanese
to one of his assistants, who turned to the crowded room and
shouted, ``Rehearsal!'' All fell quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been warned that American crews would be much slower and
lazier than Japanese crews,'' said Kitano, the legendary actor,
writer and director, as he watched the actors assemble. ``But now
that I have come, I have been continually amazed by how proficient
and fast the crews are here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitano is among the most famous media personalities in Japan,
where he regularly appears on more than a half-dozen television
programs each week. His quirky dramas and gangster thrillers have a
strong following at home and a fervent cult status abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is in Los Angeles filming ``Brother,'' his first project
in the United States and his first film in English. (Actually,
Jeremy Thomas, one of his producers, estimates that 60 percent of
the finished film will be in English and 40 percent in Japanese
with subtitles.)
</P>
<P>
   Kitano, probably best remembered by American audiences as a
prison guard in ``Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence'' (1983), directed
his first movie _ ``Violent Cop,'' a 1989 thriller about a
rule-breaking police officer battling the gangsters known as yakuza
_ when the director hired for the project dropped out at the last
minute.
</P>
<P>
   And although he has made several films that were not yakuza
thrillers _ among them ``Kikujiro,'' a road picture about an
irresponsible blowhard helping a young girl find her mother that
will be released in the United States this spring _ he remains best
known here and in Europe for his introspective and realistically
violent crime movies.
</P>
<P>
   There is 1993's ``Sonatine,'' about Tokyo yakuza sent to break
up a gang war in Okinawa, and 1997's ``Hana-Bi,'' or ``Fireworks,''
about a detective who robs a bank to take his terminally ill wife
on a last fling. (It won the Golden Lion at the 1997 Venice Film
Festival.)
</P>
<P>
   Kitano's style is distinctive, especially in the gangster
pictures; languid moments involving chilly men of honor are
interrupted by bursts of rapid-fire violence. ``Brother,'' which he
has already begun to edit, will be very much like that, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The story involves a gangster's bodyguard, played by Kitano, who
must flee Japan when his boss is murdered. He comes to Los Angeles
only to discover that his younger brother is involved in a
small-scale drug dealing scheme with black gang members (whose
leader is played by Omar Epps). Kitano's character brings
yakuza-style discipline to the gang, helping it to prosper and
smash its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Will it raise him from cult status to mainstream success in the
United States? ``The cut I have made of the film so far has the
Kitano trademark all over,'' he said during filming this week. ``So
I kind of assume this one, too, will be for the Kitano hard-core
audience rather than for the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony Pictures Classics has recently completed a deal with Kitano
and Thomas to distribute ``Brother'' in the United States. The plan
is to release the film in Japan before the end of this year, Thomas
said, although it may be readied earlier to take part in the Venice
and Toronto film festivals.
</P>
<P>
   Kitano called out in Japanese to one of his assistants, who was
sent across the room to fetch a sushi knife and a cutting board.
</P>
<P>
   ``My yakuza in this film are not like the real yakuza of
today,'' Kitano explained. ``They are more old-fashioned. In terms
of their behavior, they are very much like the kamikazes during
World War II. The willingness to sacrifice is one of the main
themes of the film.''
</P>
<P>
   The cutting board arrived. Someone was about to sacrifice a
finger in the next scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to hear one of my dreams?'' Kitano said as the
lights were being arranged. ``It is to make an omnibus film in
collaboration with Martin Scorsese. He will do the portion about
the Italian Mafia in New York; I will do the portion about the
yakuza.'' He shrugged. ``Maybe someday,'' he said. ``It is one of
my dream projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to the Zoo
</P>
<P>
   Two categories of films are part of the Sundance Film Festival,
the independent film world's annual binge of deals and discoveries
that ended Sunday in the congested ski town of Park City, Utah. The
first are films that already have a U.S. distributor and hope to
use the festival to get off to a fast start. The other, larger
category consists of films that are still seeking distributors,
usually works of love made on a shoestring and the hope that
lightning will strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Committed,'' a comedy by Lisa Krueger (whose first film was
the 1996 ``Manny and Lo,'' also a Sundance entry), is about a
Manhattan newlywed played by Heather Graham whose husband (Luke
Wilson) leaves her in the lurch. Graham's character, Joline, is the
child of divorced parents and has vowed to remain utterly faithful
to her marriage vows, to the point of having her wedding ring
tattooed on her finger. So she tracks down her errant husband in El
Paso, Texas, and stakes out his mobile home. The movie is to be
released in late April by Miramax Films.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Sundance is even more of a zoo than when I was here
before,'' Krueger said. She and Graham were having breakfast one
morning during the festival at a crowded motel coffee shop near the
event's epicenter. During her previous visit, she said, she was
trying to find a distributor for ``Manny and Lo''; this time she
was promoting a movie that already had a distributor. The
difference?
</P>
<P>
   ``This time, it's all the media swirl,'' she said. ``It's more
pleasurable, definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, working her way through a plate of scrambled eggs,
pulled off her wool ski cap and shook her head, pinwheeling her
long, blond hair.
</P>
<P>
   After a busy summer starring in two box office hits, ``Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' and ``Bowfinger,'' Graham seems
utterly likely to be playing the lead in a Miramax summer release.
But, she said, Krueger asked her to take the part long before last
summer's successes, when she was not the likeliest above-the-title
star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lisa was my biggest cheerleader,'' she said. ``And I was
really dying to play the part. I was desperately dying to do it.''
She wanted to do it so badly, she said, that she persisted even
though it forced her to go immediately from filming ``Bowfinger''
to shooting ``Committed,'' without a day off, and then immediately
to ``Austin Powers.''
</P>
<P>
   The role in ``Committed'' was by far the richest. ``It was a
million times more demanding,'' Graham said. If it meant working
several months without a day off, so what?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard work being a celebrity, man,'' she said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a Chance
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum, and the other end of Sundance,
Zeinabu irene Davis was happily answering questions after one of
the festival screenings of her film, ``Compensation.'' The film, in
the works since 1993, had already played at the Toronto Film
Festival in September and won the Gordon Parks Directing Award from
the Independent Feature Project in New York, yet it was still
looking for a U.S. distributor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, it's not the sexiest film to sell here,'' said
Davis. Several dozen audience members had remained after the
late-morning screening at the Park City Library Center and were
asking intricate questions about her artistic choices and the
research she had done. There were no distributors or celebrities in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   The 92-minute black-and-white film is languidly paced, and its
subject matter (parallel stories about black women who are deaf,
one at the turn of the century and the other in 1993) is not the
easiest hook for distributors hoping to land the next crossover
independent hit. But Davis, who teaches at the University of
California at San Diego, remains hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   The film is also structurally daring. The scenes set in
turn-of-the-century Chicago are shot as if for a silent film,
complete with title cards and static camera set-ups, and there are
subtitles throughout, for deaf audiences. Since there was no money
for detailed period sets, Davis evokes the period through archival
photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The search for those photographs consumed much of the time
between the end of production in 1995 and the film's initial
release last year. Her eyes fill with tears when she recalls that
her father, who had been one of her inspirations on the project,
died just four days before the first screening of ``Compensation''
in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Gilmore, Sundance's co-director, said of Davis'
project, ``It may not be the kind of film that is going to start a
bidding frenzy, but it's the kind of daring, innovative filmmaking
that should be part of this festival.''

 &HT;    COMMERCE SEEKS $28 MILLION MORE FOR MINORITY COLLEGES
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Commerce Secretary William Daley announced Friday
that he will ask Congress to double the funds available next year
for his department's work with colleges and universities that serve
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be doing more to help these schools produce the
scientists and engineers who are in demand today'' for jobs in his
department and private businesses, Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that approach would be better for the economy than
increasing the number of visas for computer programmers and
scientists from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The budget President Clinton will send to Congress on Monday
will request $28 million for new programs designed to help
historically black, Hispanic-serving and tribal colleges to
convince more of their students to work toward and obtain doctoral
degrees in mathematics, science and engineering.
</P>
<P>
   That would be added to the $24 million in grants now awarded
annually by the department to the minority-serving schools. But
Daley conceded that it is less than the $100 million increase that
he had suggested to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous step in the right direction,'' said Earl
Richardson, president of Morgan State University and chairman of
Clinton's advisory board on historically black colleges and
universities.
</P>
<P>
   But, while $28 million ``sounds like a lot,'' it doesn't go far
``when you spread it around,'' he said at the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Flores, president of the Hispanic Association of
Colleges and Universities, agreed in a telephone interview from San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would encourage Congress and the president to come up with
real money in future funding cycles,'' Flores said. ``We also are
concerned that Hispanic-serving institutions are not getting an
adequate proportion of the funds'' set aside for minority-serving
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, the nation had 111 historically or predominantly
black institutions of higher education with 275,000 students, 32
tribal colleges in which almost all 26,000 students are American
Indians, and 175 to 195 Hispanic-serving institutions with 1.3
million students, of which more than half are Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Department of Education reported that in the 1995-96
school year, the latest for which complete data is available:
</P>
<P>
   _ The 6,396 persons who earned doctoral degrees in engineering
included only 89 Hispanics, 74 blacks and 12 American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   _ The 1,209 who earned doctoral degrees in mathematics included
only 9 Hispanics, 9 blacks and 1 American Indian.
</P>
<P>
   _ Foreign visitors earned 3,117 doctoral degrees in engineering
and 545 in mathematics that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something is very wrong when Americans of African and Hispanic
descent and Native Americans are 24 percent of the population, but
they account for only 8 percent of the Ph.D.'s,'' Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   The minority-serving institutions that would compete for the $28
million enroll about 42 percent of all Hispanic college students,
24 percent of all African American students and 16 percent of all
American Indian students, according to the Washington-based
Alliance for Equity in Higher Education.
</P>
<P>
   At least four of the institutions would be chosen to host new
research centers set up in partnership with the department for
graduate-level research into measurement, the ocean, the atmosphere
and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Their students could also compete for scholarships, internships,
graduate fellowships and jobs with paid time off for study in those
fields.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance for Equity in Higher Education lists six Colorado
institutions in which more than one-fourth of the students are
Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   The six are Adams State College, Community College of Denver,
Otero Junior College, Pueblo Community College, the University of
Southern Colorado and Trinidad State Junior College.

   BUSH-MONEY _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush's money
men are mighty nervous, wondering if, ``that Austin crowd,'' as one
Republican strategist put it, is up to the big time. We talk to the

   BUSH-BASHERS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Though its elected days may be

Conservative Republican David Offutt and former member Donna
Ballard have made campaign appearances in Iowa and New Hampshire to
bash Texas Gov. George W. Bush on his education record. The
appearances are courtesy of Steve Forbes. We look at how this came
about and whether it will continue. (Brooks, Austin

a refugee camp here who was told that Russian forces have control

GAFFES MAKE CANDIDATES ENTERTAINING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday, Feb. 7.)  
(lh) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people judge presidential candidates on the basis of how
they stand on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   Me, I look for the guy who offers the greatest entertainment
value.
</P>
<P>
   The way I look at it, politicians may or may not live up to
their campaign promises, but a candidate who says or does amusing
things during his campaign is sure to continue doing so once he is
elected.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians who don't seem all that funny while they're
campaigning turn out to be real hoots once in office. Gerald Ford,
Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan are good examples. Richard Nixon was
amusing in his own scary way and Bill Clinton has certainly
provided the nation with lots of laughs, but they're the kind of
sleazy laughs that leave you feeling as if you should take a quick
dip in a vat of penicillin.
</P>
<P>
   On first glance, I didn't think the current crop of presidential
candidates had much to offer in the way of entertainment value. Al
Gore showed early promise by claiming to have invented the
Internet, but he failed to follow up on it by claiming, say, to
have also invented Social Security. Instead, Gore comes across as
stiff or wooden to the point that he dare not venture into the
woods for fear that beavers will gnaw his legs off.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley is a policy wonk; John McCain is amusing only in
the sense that you never know when he might haul off and hit
someone, and Steve Forbes may be the dullest human being on the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves us with George W. Bush, who I'm beginning to think
might be the real deal.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not talking about booze or drugs or any other frat-boy
hi-jinx that may or may not have happened in his past. I'm talking
about a rich and creative mangling of the English language that has
not been seen in a presidential candidate since the glory days of
Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Reuters story, writer Patricia Wilson chronicled
some of Bush's more memorable malapropisms and strangled syntax.
For those of us who fondly remember the disjointed ramblings of
George's father, it is clear that this apple has not fallen far
from the tree.
</P>
<P>
   Bush mused recently about growing up during the height of the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was coming up, it was a dangerous world, and you knew
exactly who they were. It was us versus them, and it was clear who
them was. Today we are not so sure who the they are, but we know
they're there.''
</P>
<P>
   Very true. I just hope they isn't us.
</P>
<P>
   At an elementary school in Nashua, N.H., that was celebrating
what it called Perseverance Month, Bush told several hundred
children: ``This is Preservation Month. I appreciate preservation.
This is what you do when you run for president. You've got to
preserve.''
</P>
<P>
   My mother-in-law preserves apples and strawberries. Maybe she
should consider running for president.
</P>
<P>
   In selling his education policy to audiences, Bush has declared
that the most important question to ask is, ``Is your children
learning?''
</P>
<P>
   I certainly hope my childrens is learning to speak more better
than this.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when Jimmy Carter used to call missiles ``nucular''
weapons? Bush does him one better by referring to the bombs as
``tacular'' nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair (an odd concept, but hey, I'll try anything once),
Bush, like all presidential candidates, puts in long hours, and
when you talk as much as he does some goofy things are bound to pop
out, especially at the end of a tiring day.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do politicians have a corner on the gobbledygook market, as
any casual reader of the newspaper is certainly aware.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, just so you Bush supporters out there won't feel as if
I'm picking on your boy, I'll conclude by sharing with you the
story of the British education officials who had to scrap 48,000
literacy posters because the posters had two glaring spelling
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Officials failed to noticed that the word ''vocabulary'' was
misspelled ``vocabluary'' and that students were being urged to
learn about writing ``though'' their own work instead of
``through'' it.
</P>
<P>
   All of which goes to show that the world needs fewer
spin-doctors and more proofreaders.
</P>
<P>
   If for no other reason, do it for the childrens.

'OTHERS' ISN'T HALF BAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - If you were attacked by the ghost of a dead girl,
chances are you wouldn't let a stranger who found out about it talk
you into attending a meeting of True Believers.
</P>
<P>
   That's why they don't make TV shows about you.
</P>
<P>
   Marian, played by Julianne Nicholson, is a different story.
</P>
<P>
   Marian sees dead people.
</P>
<P>
   Not like Haley Joel Osment did in ``The Sixth Sense,'' not
exactly. Marian's is a more specific gift _ she doesn't see dead
people all over the place. Just the dead girl in the bathtub of her
dorm room, actually, at least in the pilot of ``The Others,'' which
premieres Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The charms of the NBC series are more specific as well. ``The
Others'' isn't an across-the-board success like ``The Sixth
Sense.'' But it has its moments. And once you get past the
sluggishness of the first episode, it's not half bad.
</P>
<P>
   After Marian's harrowing experience, she is recruited by Miles
(John Billingsley) for the Others, a sort of a Super Friends of the
supernatural.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Miles isn't exactly a gifted pitchman.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk about me like I'm some kind of freak,'' Marian says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would depend upon your definition of `freak,' '' Miles
replies.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see _ there's a semi-famous geezer psychic (expertly
played by the great Bill Cobbs, the only cast member not prone to
fits of overacting), a med-student empath (Gabriel Macht), a New
Age sensitive (Melissa Crider), a not-all-there seer (Kevin J.
O'Connor) and a crusty blind grouch with a sixth sense (John
Aylward).
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like Marian might be onto something. But she joins
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The first episode labors under the introductions and
explanations necessary to set the series in motion. The stylized
special effects grow tiresome, and the plot _ what message is the
dead girl trying to impart? _ plays too much like a warmed-over
``X-Files'' _ where executive producers Glen Morgan and James Wong
used to work.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson makes a believable confused student. But neither Macht
nor Crider connects in the roles. Aylward, so good as Dr. Anspaugh
on ``ER,'' brings all the crust but none of the charm from that
role. O'Connor mostly mumbles. Yet the first episode isn't without
its jolts.
</P>
<P>
   But it does nothing to prepare you for the power of the second.
</P>
<P>
   It concerns a woman whose husband and 3-month-old son are
involved in a horrible accident; to reveal more wouldn't be
sporting _ the plot takes some interesting twists.
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. Kind of like ``The Sixth Sense.'' Again, nothing that
jaw-dropping _ I won't spoil that surprise, either _ but the ending
is particularly poignant.
</P>
<P>
   I don't enjoy any of the powers that the Others employ. But you
don't have to be a minor-league Kreskin to predict this: If it
overcomes hammy overacting, show-offy effects and New Age hokum,
``The'' ``Others'' may have a future. &QL;

INDONESIA OPENS BIDDING FOR PUBLIC STAKE IN AUTOMAKER 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ Indonesia's government opened the bidding for its
controlling stake in the nation's automaker Friday, a new phase in
its struggle to sell assets seized from former President Suharto's
family and friends to help finance a bailout of insolvent banks.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency said it was inviting
new bids for its 40 percent shareholding in Astra International
after a failed effort to sell the stake to a U.S.-led investment
group because of what the agency called resistance by Astra's
management.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing open the bidding represents a final attempt to achieve
the agency's goal of raising 17 trillion rupiah, or roughly $2.2
billion, by March 31 to help replenish the government treasury. The
agency said it had raised 10 trillion rupiah so far.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, international donors extended up to $4.7
billion in credit to Indonesia, enough to fill half the
government's projected budget gap for the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder is supposed to come from sales conducted by IBRA,
as the bank restructuring agency is known. It hopes to raise
roughly 9.9 trillion rupiah ($1.3 billion) from the Astra auction,
and said it would announce a short-list of up to seven bidders by
Feb. 23 and complete the sale by March 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is insufficient capital within Indonesia to sustain
development over the next few years,'' said John Dodsworth, senior
Indonesian representative for the International Monetary Fund,
which is overseeing a $43 billion international economic aid
package to the country. ``It's very important to move IBRA assets
and for foreign capital to come in.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Astra sale is also the first test of the agency's authority
following the replacement of its chairman in January with a protege
of Indonesia's president, Abdurrahman Wahid. Friday, the government
announced further personnel changes, including the appointment of
two former bankers to replace officials implicated in a corruption
scandal last year.
</P>
<P>
   Since its creation in early 1998 as a condition of IMF aid, the
bank restructuring agency has taken control of almost 50 banks and
amassed stakes in roughly 200 companies.
</P>
<P>
   But IBRA's efforts to cash in its holdings have been mixed. An
attempt late last year to sell Bank Bali, a commercial bank, fell
apart when employees revolted against the management of its
intended buyer, Standard Chartered Bank of Britain. An earlier
scandal over the misappropriation of agency bailout funds for Bank
Bali, moreover, left IBRA politically paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   In December, IBRA named a group led by Newbridge Capital and
Gilbert Global Equity Partners as its choice to take over the stake
in Astra, a listed company with interests in everything from palm
oil to semiconductors but with a focus on auto manufacturing
through joint ventures with Toyota Motor and Isuzu Motors. Efforts
by the group to evaluate the company's balance sheets, however,
were stymied by Astra executives, who say they were asked to give
up confidential information. The deal lapsed when the investor
group failed to deliver a down payment by a Jan. 31 deadline.

PARADISE LOST: CAN MANKIND LIVE WITHOUT ITS UTOPIAS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Boldface `true' in 11th graf should be italicized.) 
(mk) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Utopia may be ``no place'' (as one of the word's original
meanings suggests), but when imagined, it is always some place.
Just not here. It is across an ocean (like Sir Thomas More's
noplace that was the first to be called utopia), atop a mountain
(like H.G. Wells') or in interstellar space (like the science
fiction writer Ursula K. LeGuin's).
</P>
<P>
   The utopias philosophers imagined are just as difficult to
reach, requiring a mastery of esoteric dialogue (like Plato's) or
dialectical theory (like Karl Marx's). Paradise is glimpsed only
after strenuous intellectual or physical effort. And whoever has
made the journey to alien shores brings back tales of lands where
labor has been transformed into pleasure and knotty earthly
problems are unwoven with ease. Our world, too, the story goes,
could be like this, if only...
</P>
<P>
   And there the difficulties begin. The significance of utopias is
not that they imagine versions of perfection, but that they imagine
cures for imperfection. A utopia is not, like Peter Pan's
Neverland, an impossible place; that would turn utopianism into
mere fantasy. The promise of utopia is that while seeming to be
Neverland and Noplace, it has a chance of becoming This Land and
This Place. That is why something seemingly imaginary becomes
compellingly urgent. Utopianism defines a political program;
utopianism inspires progress.
</P>
<P>
   But, paradoxically, it also results in the opposite. Visions of
utopia have led to extraordinary horrors and nightmarish dystopias.
Some have been indelibly imagined in such fictions as ``Brave New
World'' or ``1984.'' Others, less literary, have flourished in the
hothouse of 20th century expectations: suicide cults and terrorism,
fascism and communism. What goes absolutely wrong is the attempt to
make everything absolutely right. Dystopias are failed attempts at
utopias.
</P>
<P>
   The last century has been extraordinarily rich in both attempts
and failures. So it is no surprise that the studies of utopia have
recently taken on a peculiar urgency. Last year, Russell Jacoby's
``End of Utopia'' (Basic) mourned the death of the utopian spirit
and the weaknesses of contemporary liberalism. Routledge recently
published an extensive anthology, ``The Utopia Reader,'' edited by
Gregory Claeys and Lyman Tower Sargent with readings ranging from
Hesiod to Huxley. Another anthology of utopian writings has just
been published in England (``The Faber Book of Utopias'').
</P>
<P>
   Next fall, partly inspired by the new millennium, the New York
Public Library, in collaboration with the Bibliotheque Nationale de
France, will be presenting an extensive exhibition of 400 utopian
manuscripts, maps, images and other materials from the two
libraries' collections. The exhibition will open first in France,
this summer, and then in New York, in October. Here, it will be
accompanied by three public lectures on utopianism, to be published
by Oxford University Press (full disclosure: I am delivering one of
them).
</P>
<P>
   A Society for Utopian Studies (http://www.utoronto.ca/utopia),
founded in 1975, also publishes a journal, Utopian Studies, in
which such essays as ``Primitivism in Feminist Utopias,'' ``Lewis
Carroll as Crypto-Utopian'' and ``California as Dystopia'' have
appeared. And the Internet, which has itself been the object of
many great utopian hopes, also offers an array of sites with
utopian aspirations, some of them collected at
users.erols.com/jonwill/utopialist.htm.
</P>
<P>
   But considering that these are visions of paradise, it is
astonishing how few one would feel comfortable living in. Only
those who look for utopia in the distant, irretrievable past find
an unambiguous glow. Ovid, for example, recalls a Golden Age in
which rivers flowed with nectar and honey dripped from green trees,
providing a pastoral ideal that survived for over a millennium.
More's 16th-century ``Utopia'' has a more modern forthrightness
about it: no private property, much leisure and few lawyers _ a
fantasy that has proved remarkably enduring. But there are hints of
satire in some of More's imaginings, and darker intimations that
some utopian things one ``may rather wish for than hope after.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Bellamy, a 19th-century Massachusetts journalist, wrote
what has probably been the most popular utopian vision ever
created, ``Looking Backward: 2000-1887.'' A reform movement was
based on its ideas, but this world, too, seems unpleasant. His hero
awakens in the year 2000 from a 113-year sleep, finding a
government that is an all-powerful corporation; citizens divide all
profits equally, while answering to the strict military discipline
of an ``industrial army.'' The year 2000 was also imagined by H.G.
Wells, in his 1901 book, ``Anticipations;'' it is an enlightened
era in which ``whole masses of human population'' are judged
inferior and are subject to sterilization, export or poison.
</P>
<P>
   Utopias, for all their promise of freedom, turn out to be
extraordinarily rigid places, full of rules and demarcations _
attempts to dissolve or constrain desire, greed, envy or other
human frailties. In practice, that rigidity has turned into
cruelty. The 20th century was unique not in the kinds of utopias
imagined (which have been inspired by everything from pastoralism
to feminism) but in the relentless attempts to bring them into
existence and the technology to make them seem possible. The
utopian ``science'' of Marxism and the utopian nationalisms of
fascism carried the model to extremes: grand visions of a new age
combined with horrific exorcisms and totalitarian control.
</P>
<P>
   After such historical experiences, the idea of utopia no longer
carries much moral weight. The philosopher Isaiah Berlin argued
that utopianism leads not to freedom but to tyranny. He regularly
invoked Kant in reproof: ``Out of the crooked timber of humanity,
no straight thing was ever made.'' The philosopher Karl Popper, in
``The Open Society and Its Enemies'' (which he began in 1938, on
the day the Nazis invaded Austria), wrote that those who envision
making heaven on earth will only succeed in making hell. And the
Romanian writer E.M. Cioran added an aesthetic fear to the
political one. Utopias, he wrote, are ``tedious'': ``To conceive a
 &UR; true &LR;  utopia, to sketch, with conviction, the structure of an
ideal society, requires a certain dose of ingenuousness, even
stupidity.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Utopianism enjoyed a resurgence in the 1960s and '70s in some
strains of the counterculture; there were hopes that a spiritual or
sexual revolution would transform human nature and lead to a new
form of politics. The hopes still resonate, but realities have
never lived up to expectations. More recently, the physicist Steven
Weinberg, in the January issue of the The Atlantic Monthly,
dismisses five current ideas he thinks are misguidedly utopian:
belief in the free market, in a governing elite, in the powers of
religion, in ecological consciousness, or in technological
innovation.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of such suspicion of utopianism, there has now
arisen a bit of nostalgia for the utopian spirit, a wish that it
could rise again, older, wiser and perhaps a bit less...well,
utopian. Jacoby, for example, has no patience with sentimentality,
yet he misses the energy that utopianism gave to the political
left. Now, he suggests, ``the belief is stone dead. Few envision
the future as anything but a replica of today.'' Krishan Kumar, a
historian of utopianism and a professor at the University of Kent
in England, has suggested that utopianism, for all its flaws, is in
need of some rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   What is missed by those who miss utopianism is not the prospect
of utopia itself but the prospect of trying to reach it. What is
missed is the conviction that there are methods that might be
reliably used to improve the human condition. It may be that the
most challenging political question in a knowingly wary world is
how to envision progress without envisioning a utopia.
</P>
<P>
   In the influential 1974 book ``Anarchy, State and Utopia,'' the
philosopher Robert Nozick argues essentially that the best utopia
we can expect is one in which utopian consciousness _ the
consciousness that each problem can be solved in advance and
imposed from above with a determined solution _ does not exist.
Nozick proposes, instead, a minimally intrusive government that
allows for elaborate freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   But in one sentence he ends up revealing just how far off even
this minimal utopia lies:
</P>
<P>
   ``One persistent strand in utopian thinking,'' Nozick writes,
``is the feeling that there is some set of principles obvious
enough to be accepted by all men of good will, precise enough to
give unambiguous guidance in particular situations, clear enough so
that all will realize its dictates, and complete enough to cover
all problems which actually arise.''
</P>
<P>
   But what set of principles can possibly be so obvious, precise,
clear and complete? The only widely accepted belief seems to be
that someday such principles will be found.

LETTERMAN, ON THE MEND, MAY RETURN BY MID-FEBRUARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Letterman has been making an exceptionally fast
recovery from heart surgery and might return to his ``Late Show''
on CBS as early as Feb. 14, the show's executive producer, Rob
Burnett, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For next week, the show is bringing in the biggest names from
its past guest list, including Julia Roberts, Jerry Seinfeld and
Bruce Willis, for interviews leading into repeats of highlights
from the show, Burnett said. Those interviews will be conducted by
other stars with a close association with the show, including Regis
Philbin, Charles Grodin and the show's band leader, Paul Shaffer.
</P>
<P>
   Because the shows next week will be built around the stars'
comments on their previous appearances with Letterman, Philbin and
company are not considered guest hosts. Using guest hosts to fill
in for Letterman during his convalescence from quintuple bypass
surgery three weeks ago has been widely debated at CBS because the
network otherwise would be broadcasting repeats during a ratings
sweep month.
</P>
<P>
   But Burnett said for the first time Friday that the show might
use guest hosts the week after next if Letterman's return was
delayed. He said that he and Letterman would decide by early next
week what course they would take for the week of Feb. 14.
</P>
<P>
   If guest hosts are used, it would be a first for Letterman in 18
years on the air. Burnett said Letterman had never opposed the use
of guest hosts but that the show's dependence on Letterman's style
of comedy had precluded using them.
</P>
<P>
   If guest hosts are chosen, Burnett said, they will probably come
from the group that volunteered for next week's interviews. Among
the other stars who will participate in what Burnett called
backstage-type interviews are Steve Martin, Bill Cosby, Sarah
Jessica Parker and Danny DeVito.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett said reports that Letterman could return as early as
Feb. 14 were ``a little overstated,'' but ``I would not rule it
out.'' Letterman visited his office Monday to discuss plans before
going to the Caribbean. Even if he does come back soon, Burnett
said, he may work only part of the week at first.

NFL TROUBLES TRACED TO HIP-HOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JASON WHITLOCK  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week you have asked yourself over and over again how could
wealthy NFL players Rae Carruth and Ray Lewis be implicated in
murders and how could Bam Morris and Tamarick Vanover possibly be
entangled in a drug-trafficking investigation?
</P>
<P>
   Good questions.
</P>
<P>
   I say the violence and lawlessness that we're witnessing today
among black professional athletes is a direct byproduct of the
popularity of ``hip-hop'' culture.
</P>
<P>
   Many of you reading this remember the 1960s: hippies, a
counterculture, an era of loose, wild living. Led by the Doors, the
Grateful Dead and a bunch of other drugged-out rock 'n' rollers and
pop-culture icons, white kids went wild.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop music and culture, a phenomenon of the mid-1980s and
1990s, is no different from what we experienced in the 1960s,
except it's a predominantly black culture and its music celebrates,
glorifies and promotes violence and lawlessness along with sex,
drugs and rap 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   I know many of you think it's simple-minded to blame such a
complex problem on something as harmless as a music culture.
</P>
<P>
   I'm no fool. I understand that there are tons of factors
contributing to this problem, most significantly the breakdown of
family and the myth that a support check can replace a father.
</P>
<P>
   But don't underestimate the power of pop culture, particularly
when it comes to music.
</P>
<P>
   I think most people will admit that popular music contributed to
the free-sex, drug culture of the 1960s. So why not believe that
violence-ridden rap music contributes to the rampant black-on-black
violence we read about every day in our local newspapers?
</P>
<P>
   I'm embarrassed to admit this, but I am a fan of the culture's
music. The culture has influenced my dress and speech. I wrote many
stories about hip-hop performers when I was a reporter for the
Charlotte Observer. I buy the magazines that cover hip-hop music
and culture. I was fascinated by the life and times of Tupac
Shakur, the most influential and despicable rapper of all time. I
even do freelance work for VIBE magazine, a terrific, upscale,
watered-down hip-hop mag.
</P>
<P>
   However, I am a fan who realizes hip-hop's harmful side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop music has virtually legitimized the drug dealer in
inner-city communities. Through their music and videos, hip-hop
artists have glamorized ``Ballers'' to the point that they're more
respected and revered than any working man in some communities.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop also is responsible for the proliferation of the
black-athlete entourage, often referred to as ``my dawgs from the
'hood.'' A great deal of the time they're nothing more than a
collection of uneducated, jobless cousins and childhood friends who
play important roles as leaches, flunkies and nightclub
fight-starters.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop artists travel in packs. Now, it's almost criminal for a
young black professional athlete to roll without a posse. According
to ESPN reporter Chris Mortensen, the Baltimore Ravens wanted to
talk to Ray Lewis about his unsavory posse of friends. Carruth
allegedly plotted a murder with his criminal entourage. Morris' and
Vanover's problems seem to stem from hanging with the wrong
``posse.''
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop music preaches that young black men who dissociate
themselves from childhood friends who have chosen a criminal
lifestyle are sellout Uncle Toms. It preaches that ``real
brothers'' do dirt (commit crimes) and are willing to kill or beat
down a (N-word) if he's been disrespected.
</P>
<P>
   The ties between hip-hop artist and young black professional
athletes are strong. I once attended a party for NBA star Allen
Iverson in New York, and it was filled with rappers. Derrick Thomas
has many rapper friends. Shaquille O'Neal thinks he's a rapper.
</P>
<P>
   We shouldn't be surprised by the connection. Rappers and jocks
are young black men with similar backgrounds and lots of disposable
income and free time.
</P>
<P>
   Since the slayings of hip-hop superstars Tupac Shakur and
Notorious B.I.G., we're no longer shocked when we hear that a
rapper is involved in some type of violence or lawless activity.
</P>
<P>
   From here on out, let's not act shocked when we learn that a
hip-hop athlete is involved in criminal activity. It's a big part
of the culture that too many young black men have bought into.

MARY, RHODA AND FANS CATCH UP ON 25 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK. Confession time. Mary and Rhoda were my least favorite
characters on ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show.'' So maybe I'm not
approaching this ``Mary and Rhoda'' thing with the right attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's just such a hokey idea that it's hard to take
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the show, which ran from 1970 to 1977, probably know the
history of this project. A couple of years ago, Moore wanted to do
a new sitcom updating her character, Mary Richards, and Valerie
Harper's, Rhoda Morgenstern. But CBS, home of the original series,
balked at the possibility of trashing a treasured piece of TV
history with a sequel whose quality might not be up to snuff. ABC
stepped in, liking the idea at first, but nobody could agree on a
direction for the series. As a last resort before abandoning it
altogether, Moore suggested a one-time TV movie instead of a
series.
</P>
<P>
   Thus was born ``Mary and Rhoda,'' a two-hour movie that airs
Monday night during the February ratings sweep, probably because no
executive at ABC had the nerve to tell Mary Tyler Moore her movie
really isn't very good and maybe should have stayed on the shelf,
and probably because every ABC executive knows millions will tune
in anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, of course, is with my own expectations.
``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' was a comedy, a very good one with
clever writing and great performances by a stellar cast. ``Mary and
Rhoda,'' on the other hand, isn't sure what it is. Certainly not a
comedy in the old sense, it does have amusing moments, especially
when Harper is in a scene. But it's also trying to be a dramatic
film, with a main story about Mary's return to work as a television
news producer and her battle to do good journalism at a
tabloid-style station. There also are subplots, badly developed,
about Rhoda's attempt to get back on her feet after a failed
marriage and the college-age daughters of both women trying to
exert their independence.
</P>
<P>
   But through the whole movie I kept thinking, ``Yeah, yeah. What
about the rest of the gang?'' I wanted newswriter Murray Slaughter
_ my favorite from the old show _ to walk into a scene and crack
wise. Even a visit from Sue Ann Nivens, the sex-crazed ``Happy
Homemaker,'' would have been nice.
</P>
<P>
   But Moore has said many times this wasn't a reunion project, and
that is the sad thing. It probably should have been. As a series,
``Mary and Rhoda'' might have been able to pull off an exploration
of Mary and Rhoda's lives 25 years later with barely a mention of
the old days. Character development over the long haul would help
them accomplish that. But in a one-shot film project with very
little time for fleshing out ``new'' characters _ remember, we
haven't seen Mary and Rhoda in a quarter of a century _ it's almost
necessary that a bit of the past inform the present.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, the show makes reference to Mary's famous inability to
throw a party. She complains about not being able to slam the
sliding glass door of her boss's office. She even has a big ``M''
on her wall at home, just as in the old days. So the failure to
mention Murray and Sue Ann and Mr. Grant and Chuckles the Clown
seems like a denial of the past for two women whose friendship is
rooted in it.
</P>
<P>
   Mary and Rhoda. TV movie about two main characters from ``The
Mary Tyler Moore Show'' reuniting after many years apart. Starring
Mary Tyler Moore, Valerie Harper, Joie Lenz and Marisa Ryan. Monday
night on ABC. Parental guideline rating: TV-PG.

THE BURNING VAN, AND OTHER TALES OF RELOCATION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6)

   (italics)Many people aspire to become movers and shakers. Few
may reach that goal. But nearly everyone, it seems, has to pack up
and move sometime. In the workplace, moving vertically often
requires moving horizontally _ in other words, geographically.
Employers insist on having the right people in the right places,
and an increasing number of job-hoppers initiate their own
relocations. But judging by the mail, many movers get the
shakes.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and Jean Marshall, who now live in Milwaukee, started
married life by moving from St. Paul to Philadelphia, where
Marshall had just begun a job as an accountant for the U.S. Forest
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Well before the wedding, they had arranged for a mover to make
their belongings part of a shipment aboard an eastbound van and for
a friend to receive the shipment at their almost-unfurnished
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   But when they arrived, they did not see their furniture. ``The
following day, a letter from the van line regretted that the van
had burned in Brooklyn,'' Marshall writes. ``A thoughtful woman at
the line had decided not to tell us before the wedding; after all,
it would only spoil the wedding and honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rushed out immediately to buy those towels, sheets and
every other household need with plenty of our gift cash. It was the
first and only time I've told my wife, `Let's go, dear, and spend,
spend, spend.'''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   When Rodney LaBrecque, now in charge of the Episcopal School of
the Peninsula in Foster City, Calif., was a graduate student at
Teachers College, Columbia University, in 1982, he knew that he
would be finishing his studies that May _ and he wanted to make
sure that he had a rental vehicle to take his belongings to
Simsbury, Conn., then his home.
</P>
<P>
   In February, he walked to a nearby rental service. ``I made the
arrangements for the May move,'' he writes, ``and while reading the
posters on the wall, I noticed one that said, `Ask us about our
student special!'
</P>
<P>
   ``So I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clerk said, `Just a minute,' and he yelled to his manager
in the back room, `Is the student special available yet?'
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer was that it didn't go into effect until April 1. I
said to the clerk that maybe I should wait until April 1 to take
advantage of the special, and, by the way, what was the rate of
that special?
</P>
<P>
   ``Turns out that the special was $100 more than the normal rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``As my mother once told me, `Never assume anything.'''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Not all stories about moving are tragedies or tragicomedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In December of 1991, having just accepted a new job in St.
Louis, I was eager to relocate with as little hassle as possible,''
writes Richard L. Barksdale, now an e-business and strategic
management consultant, then moving from Evansville, Ind. ``My
travel schedule was and always has been demanding,'' precluding him
from being in either place for the loading or unloading.
</P>
<P>
   ``With great fortune, I was able to accomplish my move without
ever having met in person the agent or any of the moving crew,'' he
said. ``I never even saw the van. All communications occurred over
my cell phone. I actually left the keys to my former and new
residence under the front mat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crew professionally placed my furniture based on a diagram
that I faxed to them, all without any third-party supervision.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the move, I arrived in my new condo to be very
pleasantly surprised to be welcomed to my `transported'
environment, all without damage or delay.''
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   ``My move from suburban Philadelphia to Suffolk County, New
York, in August 1986 went smoothly until my 5-month-old car,
crammed with all my important papers, jewelry, plants and food,
broke down on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge as I was driving to meet
the movers at my new place,'' writes Christine DeProperty of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Saturday night and getting late as I drove or, more
accurately, sputtered around Brooklyn looking for an open and
staffed gas station. My car finally died in front of an auto body
shop, not open for business but having a staff barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owner agreed to my hysterical requests to at least look at
the car and tell me if I could continue to Long Island.'' No, she
would learn, ``the car wasn't going anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, her movers and her belongings were most certainly
waiting for her, Ms. DeProperty realized.
</P>
<P>
   The owner, she wrote, ``agreed to store my car inside his shop
until Monday and talked one of his workers into giving me a ride to
La Guardia Airport, where I rented a car and drove to a new
address.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose I broke every rule of safety, accepting a ride with
a man I had never met,'' she said. ``But I was truly dependent on
the kindness of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movers were waiting on the porch when I arrived sometime
after 9. They had not stopped for dinner, thinking I would arrive
much sooner than they and would want to complete the move. They
were hungry and tired but took pity on me and unloaded a sofa bed
so I would not have to sleep on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``On my first day at my new job, I told the human-resource woman
that I didn't have time for orientation. Instead, I spent the first
day calling GM to invoke the warranty, finding a place in Brooklyn
that could fix my car and using my brand-new map to find my way
back to my car to empty it and have it towed to a dealer for
repair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car was never fully repaired, the job did not work out and
I moved back to Philadelphia less than two years later. But I'll
never forget that move, nor will I forget that everyone with whom I
interacted on that hot August night was kind and helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, nothing was lost or stolen from the car, although I know
the car was searched, because on Monday all the perishable food was
stored safely in the shop's refrigerator.''

HAVE HEALTH CARE FUNDS BECOME TOO FASHIONABLE?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (AttN R.I., Ill.)   (af)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The boom-and-bust cycle of biotechnology stocks has definitely
been in a boom phase, and health care mutual funds _ some of which
are chock full of the stuff _ have turned in sweet returns this
year in an otherwise sour market.
</P>
<P>
   Health care funds were up 9.6 percent in January, according to
Morningstar, the Chicago financial publisher, accounting for 8 of
the 10 top-performing funds over all. And for the 12 months through
January, health care funds returned 29.3 percent, versus 19.9 for
the average United States diversified stock fund.
</P>
<P>
   Reflexively, the fund industry has been introducing a small army
of health care offerings. Sixteen of them opened for business in
1999, according to Lipper Inc., the fund research firm, for a total
of 71.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the funds have mandates to invest across the
health care industry, some zero in on the corner with the highest
buzz: biotechnology. Expect more of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only a few pure biotech funds, so my guess is that
they'll be the next passion for fund sponsors, if the current lift
in biotech stocks continues,'' said Geoff Bobroff, a consultant in
East Greenwich, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, though, such a proliferation should be a warning
signal, said John Rekenthaler, director of research for
Morningstar. ``When a big group of new funds appears, typically
you're getting close to the end of the cycle for that sector,'' he
said. ``There might be a year or two of performance left, but
historically, investors who have held onto shares of hot sector
funds for five years haven't done too well.''
</P>
<P>
   Health care funds, in fact, have long hewed to a pattern of
rising sharply and then plunging _ often after investors have piled
into them. Still, over the long term, the country's demographics
may be cause for optimism in the sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby boomers are getting older,'' said Reuben G. Brewer,
mutual fund research manager at Value Line, and ``will increasingly
depend on drugs to make their lives better.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors might want to consider their funds' weighting in
biotechnology stocks, a particularly risky bunch these days because
of their dizzying 147.7 percent climb, on average, over the past 12
months. Biotechnology-heavy funds may not be good choices for
conservative investors, and for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a niche group,'' Brewer said. ``If something negative
happens, all of them can tank.'' Moreover, the industry is small,
and most companies are not yet profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Most specialized biotechnology funds are relatively new and
untested. Dresdner RCM Biotech and Franklin Biotech Discovery
started in 1998; Rydex Biotech opened last year. Brewer likes the
granddaddy of the group, Fidelity Select Biotechnology, which
started in 1985; it is up 27.4 percent, annualized, in the 10 years
through January.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the volatility, investors should put only a small
portion of their portfolios, say 5 percent to 15 percent, in
biotechnology, advisers say. Conservative investors might opt for
more diversified health care funds, which are far more plentiful
and usually have longer records.
</P>
<P>
   Rekenthaler likes Putnam Health Sciences, a diversified fund
with some exposure to biotechnology stocks. Brewer likes Vanguard
Specialized Healthcare and Fidelity Select Healthcare, both of
which started in the mid-1980s.

 &HT;    Delta to add coach legroom, some day
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines will probably follow American Airlines
in adding legroom in coach sections, but when and by how much
hasn't been decided, Delta's chief executive said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great initiative on their part,'' Delta CEO Leo Mullin
said of American's announcement Thursday that it will remove seats
from the coach sections of all its jets, adding about 3 inches of
legroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in general the trend toward having more space is good.
It offers Delta an opportunity to kind of move along in that area.
It won't be sudden but over time,'' Mullin said.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin noted that Delta only recently completed a fleetwide
interior remodeling, so the company is not inclined to move
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he said, the economic penalty for removing coach seats
can't be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of demand for our seats. It's got to be an issue
of balancing'' the addition of legroom against the removal of
seats, Mullin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have an answer yet on how that will be provided,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   American plans to have all its domestic jets reconfigured by
November, and international jets done next year. Average coach seat
``pitch,'' or the distance between the same point on a seat and the
one behind it, will increase from 31 to 32 inches to 34 or 35
inches, said American, which is spending $70 million on the plan.

(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6)  
 (af)  
 By ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's one of the fundamental principles of the stock market: When
interest rates go up, stocks go down. And along with financial
companies and cyclicals, technology companies _ with their sky-high
price-to-earnings multiples _ should be among the biggest losers in
an environment of rising rates.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, is the theory.
</P>
<P>
   But for the last year, the theory has been less than perfect. In
fact, it has been, well, wrong. Despite last week's bond rally,
which caused the interest rate on the benchmark 30-year Treasury
bond to fall by nearly half a percentage point in a few days, rates
are now much higher than they were in the fall of 1998. Then, the
yield on the 30-year Treasury was 4.7 percent. Today, it is 6.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, has raised its target rate four
times, with the latest quarter-point increase coming just last
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet over the same period, the NASDAQ composite index, loaded
with technology stocks, has just about tripled. That's right:
tripled, in less than a year and a half, and in the face of
long-term interest rates that rose pretty much steadily until last
week.
</P>
<P>
   To understand why that move is so astonishing, one needs to know
why rising rates are bad for the market. Economists and market
strategists generally agree that higher rates hurt stocks in three
key ways.
</P>
<P>
   First, they slow the economy by forcing consumers to spend less
on goods and services and more on debt payments. And slower
economic growth means slower growth in corporate profits. That is
especially true for so-called cyclical stocks like paper and
chemical companies.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the higher rates increase debt costs for businesses, an
expense that eats directly into the bottom line. Companies that are
highly leveraged, like banks, are viewed as especially vulnerable
here.
</P>
<P>
   The third problem, which ought to affect technology stocks most
severely, is a bit more subtle. It stems from the fact that stocks
are valued not just by how much a company earns today, but by the
profit stream that it is expected to generate in the future.
</P>
<P>
   That stream, of course, is not a certainty, so those future
profits must be discounted for time and risk. The rate at which
they are discounted is related to the risk-free rate of return _
the interest rate on the 30-year Treasury bond.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the discounting of future earnings should hurt all
stocks. But it should hurt technology stocks more than others,
because so many of them are valued at extremely high levels
relative to their current earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Profit growth in the future, sometimes the far distant future,
is expected to make up the difference. And as interest rates rise,
so should the rate at which rational investors discount those
future profits.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that discounting has apparently not occurred in the
last year, at least for the NASDAQ composite, is just one more sign
to some market experts that technology stocks are in a bubble of
historic proportions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, tech stocks are one of the most sensitive groups of
stocks to interest rates,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist of
Wells Fargo Bank. Sohn said investors have been insensitive to
rising rates this time around because many of them are not
bothering to make careful calculations about expected earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that expected earnings have been much too rosy,
projected way into the future,'' Sohn said. ``The logic is that the
returns are going to be so huge that a change in interest rate from
5.5 percent to 5.75 percent is almost irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist for First Union
Securities, was somewhat more blunt. ``What you have is not
necessarily investment by analysis,'' he said, ``but investment by
a state of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   One person's bubble, however, is another's buying opportunity.
And there is no shortage of strategists willing to argue that the
action in technology stocks last year makes perfect sense.
</P>
<P>
   Abby Joseph Cohen, chief U.S. investment strategist for Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co., said investors believe that even if higher interest
rates slow the overall economy, technology spending is likely to
continue to rise and technology companies should post strong sales
and profit growth. So they have decided that technology stocks are
relatively safe to own in a period of rising rates.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment strategist at Lehman
Brothers, agreed. In the last year, ``earnings expectations for
tech stocks relative to the overall market accelerated,'' Applegate
said. ``If you've got a company that's in a space where fundamental
final demand is exceedingly robust, they will continue to be
awarded a premium valuation.''
</P>
<P>
   That pattern has persisted since the 1950s and '60s, when
then-leading technology companies like the NCR Corp. and Sperry
traded at significant premiums to the market whether rates were
rising or falling, Applegate said.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that most technology companies have very little
debt, so rising interest rates do not hurt their bottom lines.

<P>
   And while many technology stocks now have exceptionally high
price-to-earnings multiples, Cohen and Applegate said that did not
necessarily mean that the market was overvalued. ``We think it's
now selling just about where it should be,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Applegate agreed _ and said technology stocks could go even
higher if long-term rates continued the fall that began last week.
``I don't think it's irrational, no,'' he said.

 &HT;    Shareholders make MindSpring merger with EarthLink official
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ MindSpring Enterprises is no more. On Friday, the
company's shareholders voted to approve the merger of the Internet
company with Pasadena, Calif.-based EarthLink Networks.
</P>
<P>
   The new company has the EarthLink name but retains Atlanta
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Applause broke out among shareholders after the merger was
officially approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority voted in favor of the merger and
reorganization,'' said Charles Brewer, founder, president and chief
executive of MindSpring, now chairman of EarthLink. ``If I might
add a small editorial comment: yee-ha!''
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring subscribers, who number 1.5 million, will keep
MindSpring addresses for e-mail and Web pages. They will be able to
dial into MindSpring using the same access numbers.
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink shareholders, meeting in Pasadena, also approved the
merger.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, the final meeting of shareholders was held at the
Georgia Center for Advanced Telecommunications Technology. It drew
a sizable crowd of investors curious about the new Internet
provider's organization, culture and potential for stock price.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring shareholders will receive one share of stock in the
new company for each share of MindSpring stock they hold. EarthLink
shareholders will receive 1.6 shares of stock for each share they
hold.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting EarthLink is the country's second-largest Internet
access provider with about 3 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink Chief Executive Charles ``Garry'' Betty is the new
company's chief executive. MindSpring president and chief operating
officer, Michael McQuary, is president of the new company.
</P>
<P>
   The board is composed of MindSpring and EarthLink board members,
representatives from Sprint, which owns 28 percent of EarthLink
Networks, along with one representative from Apple Computer.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer opened the meeting to questions both before and after the
vote. Major concerns from the audience centered around abandoning
the MindSpring name and the location of corporate headquarters in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we had to pick a name,'' Brewer said. ``Both names are
good names, but EarthLink was better known nationwide ... There is
some loss and some sadness for a lot of us, but it was a part of
making the deal happen.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the EarthLink's headquarters remaining in Atlanta, Brewer
said Atlanta was unquestionably a better place to base an Internet
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This company has been very successful here,'' he said. ``The
support of the community has been wonderful. In L.A., basically
nobody could give a hoot about EarthLink. This is the right place
and the ideal place for a company like ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the approval of the merger, Brewer talked about the
new company's plans for the future. ``An Internet service provider
that succeeds in attracting a large customer base can tap into lots
of alternative revenue streams in the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged increasing competition from providers who offer
free Internet access in return for having advertisements on their
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer said MindSpring had considered the free ISP model back in
1996, but ditched the idea at the time because there wasn't enough
online advertising to support it.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was still not concerned about the free ISPs, but
added it was a revenue model worth looking at in the future.

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ Far from easing off as the American
economic expansion becomes the longest in history, the nation's
employers added more jobs in January than they had in any single
month in more than two years _ drawing in people who had given up
looking for work and easing the struggle of millions of people to
make ends meet. By Louis Uchitelle. 1,300 words.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   TULSA-RACE-RIOT (Tulsa, Okla.) _ Nearly 80 years after a race
riot considered by some historians to have been the bloodiest in
the nation, a state-appointed commission on Friday recommended that
reparations be paid to families of the hundreds of victims who were
shot, burned alive or tied to cars and dragged to death. The
commission's recommendations, after two years of investigation, and
its findings that city and state officials bear responsibility for
the 1921 riot, are expected to further inflame a tense political
situation as the state legislature decides in coming weeks and
months how to proceed. By Jim Yardley.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ILL-DEATH-CASES (Chicago) _ As Illinois examines what went wrong
with a justice system that sent 13 innocent men to death row, one
common thread has already emerged: poorly financed, often
incompetent defense lawyers who failed to uncover and present key
evidence. In one case, a defense lawyer failed to prepare any
strategy for his client at the death penalty hearing the day after
the conviction, saying he had been hoping the jury would opt for
manslaughter charges. Another defense lawyer rambled so
incoherently during a death penalty trial that a state supreme
court justice wrote it ``would border on the comical if only it
were make-believe.'' By Dirk Johnson. 1,200 words.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-CAMPAIGN (Austin, Texas) _ The day after Gov. George W.
Bush's defeat in the New Hampshire primary, he arrived in South
Carolina with a broad smile, nary a trace of tension in his
shoulders and a robust arsenal of optimistic metaphors. ``There's
bumps in the road,'' Bush said at a news conference in Greenville,
S.C., on Wednesday. But, he added, what lay ahead was ``a long,
smooth highway.'' Neither his voice nor his words reflected the
heap of trouble he was in. That held true when the Texas governor
later chatted with reporters and saw fit to mention that while he
wanted the presidency, he was both grounded and rounded enough to
move on with his life if he did not get it. By Frank Bruni. 1,100
words.
</P>
<P>
   NY-PRIMARY-BALLOT (New York) _ A federal judge orders New York
state to put all four major Republican presidential candidates,
including Sen. John McCain and Alan Keyes, onto the New York
primary ballot, and decides that two of the most restrictive
primary rules are unconstitutional. By Clifford J. Levy.
</P>
<P>
   AUSTRIA-ASSESS (Vienna, Austria) _ A news analysis: Why did the
European Union swing its big gun of isolation threat on Austria
when it hadn't on Italy when neo-Fascists entered government there
in 1994, and when it has its usual day-to-day relations with
dictatorships from Cuba to Libya to Iraq? By Donald G. McNeil Jr.
1,400 words.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-UNREST (Mitrovica, Yugoslavia) _ In the worst violence
Kosovo has seen since the end of the war, seven Albanians were
killed and at least nine wounded during a night of violence when
about 500 people rampaged through the streets, bursting into
apartments, firing guns and throwing grenades. The fierce fighting
had subsided by daybreak, but a tension hung over this divided
city. By Carlotta Gall. 1,100 words.
</P>
<P>
   With photos, NYT5,6,7,8 and a map.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-COMMUNAL-APARTMENTS (St. Petersburg, Russia) _ By the
Russian logic of Tanya Konyenko, there is a good reason why she
must leave her apartment, trudge five flights downstairs, cross
Nevsky Prospekt, the city's prosperous main street, and walk to the
local banya, all simply to take a bath. Her apartment doesn't have
hot water, but that is not why. Actually, her apartment doesn't
have a bathtub. But that is not why, either. The reason is that if
her apartment had a bathtub, then she would have to share it with
two 20-ish men, a 17-year-old girl and her 18-year-old brother,
their 40-year old mother, a 64-year-old woman, her 65-year-old
husband, a 70-year-old babushka, her 72-year-old husband, and
finally, with her own husband, Yura. It is the very essence of that
most Soviet of Russian institutions, the communal flat. In Tanya
and Yura's apartment, what people share would make Jerry Springer
blush. By Michael Wines. 1,800 words.

   PHOENIX _ In Arizona politics, everybody has a favorite John
McCain story. One of them goes like this.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, having just moved to the state to begin his political
career, McCain was engaged in a bitter race for a seat in Congress.
One of his opponents called his ex-wife, fishing for dirt about the
candidate. When he heard of this, McCain cornered the man at a
gathering and told him: ``I want you to know that, campaign aside,
politics aside, you ever do anything like that again, anything
against a person in my family, I will personally beat the (crap)
out of you.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator's temper is much in the news these days. It all
began in Arizona, where the governor, Jane Hull, has bucked
tradition by endorsing George W. Bush rather than the senator from
her own state.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hull told an interviewer that her relationship with McCain
was ``not particularly warm,'' and recounted the several times she
had felt the lash of his temper.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, a withering editorial appeared in the Arizona
Republic (a paper that has often sparred with the senator) which
noted how often he had called reporters ``liars'' and ``idiots''
and concluded by asking ``whether McCain has the temperament, and
the political approach and skills, we want in the next president of
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   A volcanic temper is hardly uncommon in American politics, let
alone among American presidents (the present incumbent has had
plenty of beet-red moments). Yet it poses a sizeable problem for
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Following his stunning victory this week in the New Hampshire
primary, he is now widely seen as the most formidable challenger to
Bush; but it is not good to be trailing Bush in his own state.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's primary, on Feb. 22, is essential to McCain's hope of
ambushing the Texas governor early in the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, a candidate can usually rely on a
primary victory in his home state. Yet Arizona is anything but
normal.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, over the past decade the state has drawn in a
great influx of immigrants from California and the East Coast. The
local football team, the Arizona Cardinals, often finds the
cheering in its own stadium louder for the other side.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is discovering that having an Arizona address is not
necessarily a seal of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Larger forces may also be contributing to his troubles.
According to Bruce Merrill, a professor at Arizona State
University, the national news media now dominate politics,
rendering a local advantage virtually irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Arizonans form their political opinions by
watching the same news programs as the rest of America, and
statewide polling largely mirrors polling for the country as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the troubling political implications of a close race in
Arizona, there are also serious financial considerations. McCain
will now have to devote precious money just to secure a victory at
home.
</P>
<P>
   With a name known throughout the state and three landslide
Senate victories under his belt, he will need to spend far less in
Arizona than he has devoted to New Hampshire and South Carolina
(the other early primary on which he rests his hopes); yet even a
moderately costly Arizona campaign could drain his coffers for what
comes afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hull's endorsement of Bush was probably for political
rather than personal reasons. A moderate Republican with a lot of
Democratic support, she is cut from much the same ideological cloth
as Bush, and the two have worked closely together on policy
concerning the border with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Nor may her preferences make much difference. Voters who turn
out at the primaries tend to be more conservative than the general
electorate, so the centrist Mrs. Hull may do little to enlarge
Bush's base of support.
</P>
<P>
   As for McCain, he has enlisted the help of a network of Arizona
politicians, including the popular speaker of the state's House, to
strengthen his position with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   He still has plenty of fans there, some of whom even appreciate
his temper. As Mark Spitzer, an Arizona state senator, says, ``You
damn well know where you stand with the guy.'' &QL;

<P>
   Arizona's primary, on Feb. 22, is essential to McCain's hope of
ambushing the Texas governor early in the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, a candidate can usually rely on a
primary victory in his home state. Yet Arizona is anything but
normal.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, over the past decade the state has drawn in a
great influx of immigrants from California and the East Coast. The
local football team, the Arizona Cardinals, often finds the
cheering in its own stadium louder for the other side.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is discovering that having an Arizona address is not
necessarily a seal of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Larger forces may also be contributing to his troubles.
According to Bruce Merrill, a professor at Arizona State
University, the national news media now dominate politics,
rendering a local advantage virtually irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Arizonans form their political opinions by
watching the same news programs as the rest of America, and
statewide polling largely mirrors polling for the country as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the troubling political implications of a close race in
Arizona, there are also serious financial considerations. McCain
will now have to devote precious money just to secure a victory at
home.
</P>
<P>
   With a name known throughout the state and three landslide
Senate victories under his belt, he will need to spend far less in
Arizona than he has devoted to New Hampshire and South Carolina
(the other early primary on which he rests his hopes); yet even a
moderately costly Arizona campaign could drain his coffers for what
comes afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hull's endorsement of Bush was probably for political
rather than personal reasons. A moderate Republican with a lot of
Democratic support, she is cut from much the same ideological cloth
as Bush, and the two have worked closely together on policy
concerning the border with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Nor may her preferences make much difference. Voters who turn
out at the primaries tend to be more conservative than the general
electorate, so the centrist Mrs. Hull may do little to enlarge
Bush's base of support.
</P>
<P>
   As for McCain, he has enlisted the help of a network of Arizona
politicians, including the popular speaker of the state's House, to
strengthen his position with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   He still has plenty of fans there, some of whom even appreciate
his temper. As Mark Spitzer, an Arizona state senator, says, ``You
damn well know where you stand with the guy.'' &QL;

   There are still unexplored places on the Earth; and in many
cases it is scientists, rather than adventurers, who want to get
there first.
</P>
<P>
   The seabed and space are not the only final frontiers; pockets
of the globe, from the impenetrable jungle in the center of South
America to the high ice desert of Greenland and the tributaries of
the Blue Nile in Ethiopia, remain virgin territory for scientific
explorers.
</P>
<P>
   Colonel John Blashford-Snell, the chairman of Britain's
Scientific Exploration Society and an unstoppable explorer at 63,
is launching a five-year program to tackle as many untrodden areas
of the world as possible.
</P>

   He is seeking self-funded volunteers to go on the expeditions,
which would last between two and three weeks, but they must
understand that the emphasis is on research rather than
record-breaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the areas left are some of the most difficult and
inhospitable. The people who want to go in there and do exploration
have got to be slightly nuts,'' he said.

adventurer goes somewhere and does something frightfully difficult

Physical challenges do not interest the colonel. ``Any fool can be

</P>
<P>
   ``What we are interested in is finding new forms of medical
cures, new animals and new ways of helping people. You can't be in
this game without being a conservationist.''
</P>
<P>
   Colonel Blashford-Snell's last trip, in October, was a
reconnaissance for a three-month expedition through the
little-known Paraguayan Gran Chaco, an area of inhospitable thorn
forest where some of the Indian tribes have never had contact with
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a green desert,'' he said. ``I didn't see anyone. I
saw Indians' tracks, but they were afraid to approach me.''

<P>
   In March he is off to investigate herbal medicines in Guyana,
home to the Wai-Wai tribe of hunter-gatherers.

<P>
   One of the most fascinating areas on his list is, he believes,
the Great Atrato Swamp in the Darien jungle between Panama and
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are pockets along the border which are pretty much
unexplored,'' he said. ``It's a fathomless swamp, a vast medieval
morass full of mosquitoes, alligators and very few people.
Expeditions try to go in there but fail.''
</P>
<P>
   The list includes the hill country of Burma, which has been
penetrated rarely since 1946 because of the closed border, and the
Kalahari desert. Unlike the Sahara with its sand dunes, it
comprises bush and scrub.

   There are rumors about treasures and lost cities, but Colonel
Blashford-Snell doubts they exist. The real reason for going would

MCCAIN AND BUSH BATTLE OVER VETS IN SOUTH CAROLINA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 6)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ South Carolina's 366,600 military veterans are
finding themselves in a new combat zone _ the cross fire between
Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Both Republicans have deployed organizers to all 46 of the
state's counties. Their task: Drum up votes from veterans and
military retirees and their families in the state's increasingly
crucial Feb. 19 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in the wake of McCain's blowout victory over Bush in
the New Hampshire primary, the two front-runners held dueling
veterans-oriented rallies in South Carolina. Each pumped up his
campaign with endorsements by medal-of-honor winners. Each claimed
to be better able to rebuild U.S. military might and address such
issues as health care for veterans and retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates have vociferous critics and defenders among
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   J. Thomas Burch Jr., chairman of the National Vietnam &AMP; Gulf War
Veterans Coalition, standing on a stage next to Bush Thursday,
accused McCain of failing to support his group on aiding veterans
suffering from Gulf War Syndrome and exposure to the toxic Agent
Orange during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   But the next day Jerry Thibeau, a 58-year-old Navy retiree and
veteran of three tours in Vietnam, interviewed by phone as he was
tending bar at a crowded Veterans of Foreign Wars post in Little
River, shouting over the din, exlaimed, ``We're all for McCain! I
think he understands what veterans have gone through.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Bush, Air Force Gen. Claudius ``Bud'' Watts, former
president of the Citadel military college in Charleston, says he is
``the best man to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gerald T. Pothier, South Carolina's VFW commander, said Bush
``refuses to answer questions about past drug use. If he does that
now, it makes you wonder what he'll do in the future.'' By
comparison, McCain's ``honesty and candor are big things,'' said
Pothier, 65, who spent 37 years in the Marine Corps. Pothier says
he is neutral on the candidates, but he added that McCain has ``not
danced around anything, no matter how harmful it might be to him
personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Veterans in South Carolina are 14.3 percent of the voting-age
population. Although new high-tech and service industries are
mushrooming, the state remains conservative, and despite rounds of
base closings over the past decade, military installations such as
Shaw Air Force Base and the Army's Fort Jackson are key components
of its economy.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Caulder, the state's deputy director of veterans affairs,
says, ``South Carolina is still a very close-knit state as far as
families are concerned. So respect for veterans and issues of
concern to veterans do tend to filter out into the community.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government pumps in $365 million annually in
veterans' pension and disability compensation, a significant sum in
a relatively poor southern state.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls that show McCain gaining on Bush in South Carolina
do not break out support from veterans. But McCain demonstrated his
appeal to veterans in New Hampshire's primary last week, drawing
their support by a 2-1 margin over Bush.
</P>
<P>
   On the issues, McCain portrays himself as a congressional
champion for veterans, fighting for a military pay raise and
against a 1998 raid on veterans benefits to pay for pork-barrel
highway projects.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also proposed incorporating military retirees over 65
into the federal government's generous health care plan. This would
compensate them for the loss of access to hospitals and health care
on military installations.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's not-so-subtle slam at President Clinton in promising to
bring dignity and respect back to the Oval Office appeals to
veterans as well as other groups.
</P>
<P>
   And like McCain, he has talked about restoring American military
might and higher pay for those in uniform. In speeches he has
emphasized removing barriers and red tape in the government's
health care system for veterans. In particular, he has cited a need
to aid those who served in the Persian Gulf and suffer from Gulf
War Syndrome, which includes chronic fatigue, muscle pain and
memory loss and has stricken more than 100,000 returning veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing slippage in momentum in South Carolina, the Bush
campaign is going all out to corral support from veterans groups
and prominent veterans. Recruits include Jim Gunn, chairman of the
Coalition of Retired Military Veterans, a group of 11,000
headquartered in Sumter, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain, in my eyes, is a liberal,'' said Gunn, 68, a
19-year Marine veteran who fought in the Korean War. Gunn also
accused the senator in a telephone interview of failing to fight
vigorously when Congress cut back on health benefits for veterans
and military retirees. McCain's acknowledged bout with marital
infidelity and the breakup of his first marriage ``make Clinton
look like a choir boy,'' Gunn charged.
</P>
<P>
   But alluding to McCain's five-and-a-half years as a prisoner of
war in Vietnam while Bush avoided the war by serving in the Texas
Air National Guard, Gunn acknowledged that piercing through the
McCain mystique among veterans will be an uphill fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the press continues to profile McCain as a military icon,
the masses that don't check into his background are going to get
sucked in,'' he said. ``It's going to be very bad for Bush.''

COMPART OFFERS $3.47 BILLION FOR FOOD CONGLOMERATE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Compart, an Italian holding company, offered Friday to
pay $3.47 billion for 100 percent ownership of one of Europe's
biggest energy and food conglomerates, Montedison.
</P>
<P>
   Compart, which currently owns 32 percent of Montedison, is
controlled mainly by large Italian banks that created it when they
exchanged debt for equity in the early 1990's in the Ferruzzi
group, which then controlled Montedison. Ferruzzi collapsed in 1993
under a $17 billion debt burden.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Compart rose 4 percent after the announcement. Shares
in Montedison gained almost 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Compart said it would offer 1.85 euros for each ordinary share
that it did not already own in Montedison, which has controlling
stakes in the Italian Edison energy utility and Eridania
Beghin-Say, a sugar and food products group based in France.
</P>
<P>
   But Compart said it would not proceed with the bid if it would
also have to make parallel bids for the shares in Edison and
Eridania Beghin-Say that Montedison does not hold. Italian law
generally requires such parallel bids, though there are exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Compart was the name given to the Ferruzzi holding company by
the banks, led by Mediobanca, when they took it over in June 1993.
Ferruzzi was the creation of Raul Gardini, a flamboyant Italian
financier whose debt-financed spending spree in the 1980s made
Ferruzzi one of Italy's biggest industrial groups.
</P>
<P>
   Ferruzzi collapsed as Italian prosecutors investigated charges
of corruption and crooked bookkeeping among company officials. As
details of the widespread corruption became known, Gardini
committed suicide in July 1993, about a month after the banks
seized Ferruzzi.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tulsa tried hard to forget its darkest days for
seventy years. But now, the city in Oklahoma is remembering one of
the worst racial atrocities in American history, and may act to
compensate the victims.
</P>
<P>
   White residents of Tulsa stormed the black part of town on May
31, 1921. When they had finished, perhaps 300 people were dead. And
a prosperous and thriving place which had been called the Black
Wall Street was still burning, with 35 city blocks left in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for decades the event was swept under the carpet; a black
man was even blamed for starting the violence.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble started when a young black man was rumored to have
grabbed a white girl by the arm in an elevator. He was arrested,
and rumors swept the city that he would be lynched.
</P>
<P>
   A confrontation between white and black Tulsans exploded into
violence, and white rioters destroyed the black parts of the city.
The state's National Guard arrived, too late to be much help
anyway. But in the event, they used heavy machine guns to kill
blacks who had not fled the city.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the bodies have never been found and the death toll was
persistently given as much lower _ perhaps three dozen.
</P>
<P>
   One of the grimmest tasks of those probing the incident has been
to search the city cemetery for what are thought to be mass graves.
</P>
<P>
   The incident is often called a ``race riot,'' but it was much
more than a riot. Some reports from the time said that high
explosives and aircraft were used to destroy the area.
</P>
<P>
   This was ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   There can be no doubt about what the white residents of Tulsa
wanted to do. One of the postcards of the time (Americans would
often send each other postcards about these vile events) reads:
``Running the Blacks out of Tulsa.''
</P>
<P>
   The point, as in Croatia or Bosnia, was to remove the people,
not just to murder.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, white Americans were ethnically cleansing
communities during the period, sometimes called the Black
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   In Forsyth County in Georgia, a notorious nest of racism, over
1,000 black citizens were driven from the area in 1912 after the
rape and murder of a white woman and the lynching of her accused
assailant.
</P>
<P>
   Things don't change much. In the last census, Forsyth County had
28 black residents out of 75,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The Tulsa atrocity was by no means alone. Between the end of the
nineteenth century and the 1930s, American whites on many occasions
attacked blacks en masse.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Washington, East St. Louis, and across the country,
hundreds, perhaps thousands were killed. All the while, lynching
was claiming the lives of one black man every week at the height of
the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa has tried, since 1997, to investigate the killings. The
commission set up to investigate the Tulsa atrocity met Friday to
consider how to right the wrong, and was discussing an offer of $12
million in compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not feel that this will come close to making those
affected whole,'' said Jim Lloyd, a local lawyer on the commission.
But it would make a start, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of reparations is not new. Florida granted $2.1
million in reparations in 1994 for a riot that destroyed the black
community of Rosewood in 1923.
</P>
<P>
   A local politician has suggested that the city and state pay $3
million each for the Tulsa killings. At least one other such
atrocity, in Arkansas, is also being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an emotional issue. We don't want to limit any view, any
debate,'' said Bob Blackburn, who chairs the commission on the
issue. ``We want the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   America's leading black organization, the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP,) grew out of a
conference to protest against an atrocity in Springfield, Ill., in
1908, and it continues to press for justice for those who suffered
in the these atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general idea of reparations is to somehow make whole,''
said Julian Bond, chairman of the NAACP. ``There is no way that
money can make whole such a grievous wrong. It is more the
acknowledgment that some wrong has been done.'' &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tulsa tried hard to forget its darkest days for
seventy years. But now, the city in Oklahoma is remembering one of
the worst racial atrocities in American history, and may act to
compensate the victims.
</P>
<P>
   White residents of Tulsa stormed the black part of town on May
31, 1921. When they had finished, perhaps 300 people were dead. And
a prosperous and thriving place which had been called the Black
Wall Street was still burning, with 35 city blocks left in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for decades the event was swept under the carpet; a black
man was even blamed for starting the violence.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble started when a young black man was rumored to have
grabbed a white girl by the arm in an elevator. He was arrested,
and rumors swept the city that he would be lynched.
</P>
<P>
   A confrontation between white and black Tulsans exploded into
violence, and white rioters destroyed the black parts of the city.
The state's National Guard arrived, too late to be much help
anyway. But in the event, they used heavy machine guns to kill
blacks who had not fled the city.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the bodies have never been found and the death toll was
persistently given as much lower _ perhaps three dozen.
</P>
<P>
   One of the grimmest tasks of those probing the incident has been
to search the city cemetery for what are thought to be mass graves.
</P>
<P>
   The incident is often called a ``race riot,'' but it was much
more than a riot. Some reports from the time said that high
explosives and aircraft were used to destroy the area.
</P>
<P>
   This was ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   There can be no doubt about what the white residents of Tulsa
wanted to do. One of the postcards of the time (Americans would
often send each other postcards about these vile events) reads:
``Running the Blacks out of Tulsa.''
</P>
<P>
   The point, as in Croatia or Bosnia, was to remove the people,
not just to murder.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, white Americans were ethnically cleansing
communities during the period, sometimes called the Black
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   In Forsyth County in Georgia, a notorious nest of racism, over
1,000 black citizens were driven from the area in 1912 after the
rape and murder of a white woman and the lynching of her accused
assailant.
</P>
<P>
   Things don't change much. In the last census, Forsyth County had
28 black residents out of 75,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The Tulsa atrocity was by no means alone. Between the end of the
nineteenth century and the 1930s, American whites on many occasions
attacked blacks en masse.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Washington, East St. Louis, and across the country,
hundreds, perhaps thousands were killed. All the while, lynching
was claiming the lives of one black man every week at the height of
the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa has tried, since 1997, to investigate the killings. The

WHITE HOUSE ADDS MORE MONEY FOR MISSILE DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release 8 a.m. EST Monday, Feb. 7) (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The $291 billion defense budget the Clinton
administration is unveiling Monday boosts funds for a futuristic
weapon system that would link radars, space sensors and rockets to
protect the United States from a missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   The weapon, which is known as National Missile Defense, is a
high priority for both the administration and the
Republican-controlled Congress. The budget, for the fiscal year
that begins Oct. 1, includes an increase of $400 million over last
year's National Missile Defense funding level, and an overall
increase of $2.3 billion through 2005.
</P>
<P>
   A senior defense official said the additional money ensures the
program will be sufficiently ``robust'' by increasing the number of
rocket interceptors from 20 to 100. The additional funds also allow
the Pentagon to upgrade early warning facilities and build a new
radar complex in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is scheduled to decide this summer whether to
commit the government to deploying a missile defense system to
shield the 50 states against missile attack, a system that could
cost $12.7 billion. The goal is to have it in place by 2005. But
the cost could grow substantially if additional rockets and launch
sites are added later.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union address on Jan. 27, Clinton said the
United States needs ``a system to defend against new missile
threats, while working to preserve our Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty with Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike President Ronald Reagan's vision of an elaborate
space-based shield to thwart hundreds of intercontinental ballistic
missiles, National Missile Defense is designed to hit only a few
missiles sent aloft by ``rogue nations'' like North Korea or a
missile accidentally launched by Russia or China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision to deploy the system depends on two
variables: If there continues to be a growing missile threat from
potential foes, and if the Pentagon can achieve the technological
breakthroughs required so that this complex system of advanced
sensors, radars and missiles actually works.
</P>
<P>
   A major concern _ evident in a test failure of the weapon on
Jan. 19 _ is that it might simply be too difficult to track and
destroy a missile traveling several times the speed of sound and to
blow it up by ramming it with another missile.
</P>
<P>
   During the test failure, two infrared sensors failed to guide
the high-speed interceptor ``kill vehicle'' fired from a Pacific
atoll into a dummy warhead in space launched from Vandenberg Air
Force Base in California.
</P>
<P>
   But Defense Secretary William Cohen said that despite the
failure, Pentagon officials believe the technology will work,
asserting that the interceptor came within 100 feet of hitting its
target. ``I think the technology is certainly proving to be on the
right track,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to technology hurdles, the weapon faces political
obstacles. Cohen is worried that Russia and China are likely to use
European concerns about the missile defense system to drive a wedge
between Washington and its allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would anticipate that the Russians and Chinese will try to
dissuade our European allies from endorsing or embracing the
project, to try to find weaknesses and differences of opinion and
try to exploit those,'' Cohen said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and China assert that such a weapon would violate the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty between the Soviet Union and
United States. The Europeans are concerned that such a weapon could
destabilize relations with Russia, while fomenting an isolationist
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he was hopeful of winning Russian agreement to amend
the ABM treaty to permit deployment of the system. If the Russians
do not agree, the president would be faced with the prospect of
withdrawing from the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   National Missile Defense has four major components:
</P>
<P>
   _ Space- and ground-based sensors to provide early warning of
attacking missiles;
</P>
<P>
   _ Ground-based radars to track the threatening warheads;
</P>
<P>
   _ Ground-based missile interceptors based in North Dakota and
possibly Alaska to collide with and destroy enemy warheads;
</P>
<P>
   _ A battle-management system that would link all the components
with military commanders.

<P>
   It would have been better for Austria if one of its mainstream
parties had been able to form a government alone after the
inconclusive general election last October.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been better, too, if more of Austria's voters had
told Jorg Haider, the leader of the xenophobic and right-wing
Freedom Party, to get lost.
</P>
<P>
   But the European Union's reaction to the prospect of the Freedom
Party joining a ruling coalition has been hypocritical and wholly
disproportionate to Austria's supposed offense in seeking to build
a stable government backed by a majority of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing in the EU's constitution, in letter or spirit,
that says its members should exclude from office even extreme
nationalists, so long as they are democratic and act within the
law. Nor would such exclusion be wise.
</P>
<P>
   Hectoring from abroad _ the United States has been doing it too
_ is precisely what bolsters flag-wavers like Haider, who likes to
present himself as a champion of ``plucky little Austria.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Haider is a crude populist. He has only reluctantly
come around to Austria's membership of the EU and he is loth to see
ex-communist countries from the east welcomed in. He wants to curb
immigration, has used some crass language about foreigners and
talks of the threat that outsiders pose to Austria's identity.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is noble. He has also made two much-quoted
statements that seem far too friendly to the memory of Hitler, whom
he now roundly if belatedly condemns.
</P>
<P>
   But, unlike other (much smaller) parties in Austria, Haider's
group has never promoted itself as neo-Nazi, nor has its leader
expressed anti-Semitic views. He does not incite violence against
foreigners or ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt he has some nasty supporters; so do most parties. But
many Freedom voters are quite respectable, especially those who are
loyal to the more libertarian tradition of the party, which, before
Haider took over, governed in coalition with the Socialists in the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   They, and others, are motivated less by racism than by a belief
that the established parties of Austria's center-right and
center-left have been involved for too long in a corrupt carve-up
of power and patronage. At least about that, they have a point.
</P>
<P>
   There are several parties in European countries, including EU
members, that are directly descended from communist or fascist
parties that once condoned mass-murder.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's post-fascists _ lineal heirs of Mussolini, however much
they may have fumigated themselves _ have been in coalition
government, and are now accepted, on the left as well as the right,
as part of the democratic fabric.
</P>
<P>
   A senior minister in Franco's authoritarian regime founded an
alliance that evolved into the immaculately center-right, would-be
Blairite party now ruling Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Communists whose forebears nourished Stalin, and have been
notoriously tardy in condemning his crimes, today sit in ministries
in France.
</P>
<P>
   Haider may be no better than such people. But he is not much
worse.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, in contrast to its German-speaking big brother to
the north, Austria has been notably feeble over the years in facing
up to its past. The mainstream conservatives were reluctant to
acknowledge the grubby war record of Kurt Waldheim, who was
Austria's president from 1986 to 1992 after being the
secretary-general of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Social Democrats have been prone to portray Austrians
as mere victims of Nazism, although their country had a higher
membership of the party, proportional to population, than Germany
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Across the board, Austrians _ Haider emphatically included _
have yet to do their share of post-Nazi repentance. But, smelly as
he is, Haider is neither a Nazi nor a threat to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   If the Austrians want him in government, outsiders should not
stand in the way. &QL;

<P>
   He was expected to win this first real contest, but in a close
race.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, John McCain's victory in the New Hampshire primary was
crushing: he defeated George W. Bush, long deemed certain to gain
the Republican nomination, by a wounding 18 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The press hailed this always-hoped-for upset: praise be, a new
face for the front page. But McCain represents much more than that.
Given half a chance, he could bring some useful political upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   In a race that is being fought essentially over the Clinton
legacy, McCain appears as different from the incumbent as it is
possible to be.
</P>
<P>
   His demeanor is upright, even noble. He has a hero's past. Words
such as ``self-sacrifice'' and ``principle'' fit easily on him.
Audiences are surprised, even shocked, by his candor.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of his campaign is a drive to reform America's
election-finance laws, those same laws that President Bill Clinton
(with Al Gore, his heir apparent, assisting) flouted so routinely
on his way to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   McCain represents cleanness in every respect, from financing of
campaigns to an almost pathological aversion to lying, even to
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that his supporters see him as the knight-errant of
American politics, bravely aiming his lonely lance at special
interests and political establishments of every conceivable
venality.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a conservative Republican, lest that be forgotten,
with a perfect voting record in the Senate on issues dear to
conservatives' hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Although voters may not particularly care to notice, McCain is
the antithesis of Clinton not just in terms of character, but on
issues such as deregulation (fiercely for it) and abortion
(guardedly against it).
</P>
<P>
   He differs markedly on foreign policy, too. Where Clinton, at
least until the past year or so, had to be prodded to take a
reluctant interest in what the outside world was doing, McCain has
said he wishes foreign policy was the only issue in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   No shilly-shallying from him if he reaches the White House: when
the need arises and the cause is right, McCain wants you to
understand, he will not hesitate to commit America abroad and pay
the cost.
</P>
<P>
   But can he ever be president? At this point, intriguing factors
come into play.
</P>
<P>
   His victory in New Hampshire has come as a deep shock to the
Republican powers-that-be, who have staked everything on Bush. If
they look disinterestedly at the scene before them, they can
appreciate that they have in McCain, the Anti-Clinton, the perfect
candidate to take on Gore _ who, after squeaking past Bill Bradley,
now looks set for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will run rings around Gore on campaign finance and
ethics. He will effortlessly represent him as the epitome of the
bad old days. He will be a man without political IOUs, where Gore
and Bush have based their whole campaigns on them.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, McCain will be able to draw independent
voters towards the Republican Party. This was the key to much of
his success in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Registered independents now account for 15 percent of America's
electorate. The Jesse Ventura phenomenon, whereby another
celebrated anti-politician was elected governor of Minnesota, shows
that they have power.
</P>
<P>
   But they are not inevitably opposed to the two main parties:
given a candidate who shows spirit and piques their interest, as
McCain does, they will vote for him despite his Republican label.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, despite all this, the Republican establishment has big
problems with McCain. For surprisingly, under the surface steel,
they detect a soft heart on economic and fiscal matters: a heart
that is, in fact, Clintonite, and threatens to pull the Republican
Party in a new direction altogether.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two decades, especially since the Contract with
America, the Republicans have defined themselves by their devotion
to tax cuts. The likelihood of substantial budget surpluses has
encouraged them even more: Bush is offering $1.4 trillion-worth,
intended, as Republican tax cuts normally are, mostly to benefit
the rich.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has other plans. He wants to use the surpluses first to
pay down the national debt and to bolster Social Security, the
public-pensions system. After that, he proposes a modest tax cut
aimed mostly at the middle classes.
</P>
<P>
   The establishment is right: this is a proposal Clinton would be
proud of. Although the Republican Party has captured middle-class
votes before, famously under Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, it has
never chosen to present itself as a party that cares more for the
average man than for the rich.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is throwing open doors across class divides as well as
party lines, and this could shake up the Republicans for good.
</P>
<P>
   Could do; but perhaps not. For the fact is that McCain's road
out of New Hampshire is still all uphill. He has a shoestring
organization elsewhere, and other states are less likely to be
impressed by what amounts to a cheeky insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   He will enjoy the famous ``bounce'' for a while, of course. But
at the end of the day the party elders are very unlikely to abandon
Bush, to whom they have already pledged their organization and
their money if not, entirely, their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   McCain (in a metaphor he would appreciate) is a grenade-thrower
who could conceivably win them the White House. But to back him
requires a bravery they have not learned from him yet. &QL;

 &HT;    VIOLENCE, ARRESTS AND RECRIMINATIONS FAIL TO END MEXICAN STUDENT
STRIKE
 &HT;    (600&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Violence on the streets and arrests of youths
reached a fever pitch this week in Mexico's student strike, which
has paralyzed one of the world's biggest public universities for 10
months.
</P>
<P>
   The university's rector met Friday with strike leaders behind
closed doors to attempt to kick-start stalled negotiations, while
striking students marched in the evening through downtown Mexico
City to condemn what they called violent provocations.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the months of meetings, marches and referendums held
pro and con, no end is yet in sight for the crisis that has shut
down Mexico's National Autonomous University, known here as the
UNAM.
</P>
<P>
   Even though many Mexicans no longer appear to support the
strike, which was prompted by a proposal to raise virtually free
tuition to about US$140 a year, they remain profoundly
uncomfortable with using force to quell the dispute. Rival
politicians here who are locked in competition during an election
year blame each other for mess.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the strike last spring, many Mexicans
sympathized with the students' underlying fear that the country's
premier public university will no longer be accessible to the
working poor. The administration responded months ago to this
sentiment by offering to make its tuition increase ``voluntary.''
</P>
<P>
   But a hard core of students remain convinced that they cannot
trust the administration and, among other concessions, they are
demanding rock-solid proof that the university will remain free in
the future. In a country where more than half the population lives
in poverty, they see their greater cause as one against Mexico's
endemic corruption and the controversial transformation of Mexico's
economy to a more free-market system with fewer government
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fight against the privatization of the university,''
said Fernando Lopez, 17, a defiant striker who does guard duty
every day at an UNAM-run prep school that, like all university
installations, has been occupied by students.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting among stacks of pamphlets and strike banners, Lopez was
using a school phone early Friday to summon supporters to the march
through Mexico City that evening to protest the jailing Tuesday of
71 minors and 171 adults who are being held on various charges of
sabotage, vandalism and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday federal police were dispatched to break up a melee
outside a prep school where anti-strike university employees and
students attempted to take over an installation occupied by
strikers.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 people were injured in fights and the incident has
prompted furious finger-pointing over who is to blame for allowing
the strike to drag on and reach dangerous levels of tension.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday and Friday parents and strike supporters protested
outside jails demanding the release of detained students. The
university's rector, Ramon de la Fuente, met quietly with strike
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   De la Fuente was recently appointed by Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo to take over as chief administrator when the previous
rector failed to end the strike. Last month, in a challenge to a
student-led referendum that fizzled, de la Fuente organized his own
non-binding balloting to gauge support to end the strike.
</P>
<P>
   The rector's referendum won the approval of popular Mexican
writers and political figures of various political stripes.
</P>
<P>
   About 86 percent of some 150,000 people who voted urged the
students to accept the rector's latest proposal and end the
conflict. Emboldened by the results, de la Fuente tried to march
onto the UNAM campus to confront strikers but retreated when an
angry crowd confronted him.
</P>
<P>
   The strikers rejected the referendum as ``rigged'' and said it
didn't represent enough of the 270,000-strong student community to
be a legitimate majority.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   After the violent clash on Tuesday at one of the UNAM's prep
schools, the strikers blamed the rector for provoking
confrontations by dispatching employees to attempt a takeover and
then requesting the federal police to stop resulting violence.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the university is an autonomous institution that
makes its own rules and settles its own disputes. But since the
budget is federal and the rector is appointed by the president,
Zedillo has been implicitly drawn into the fray and has been blamed
for failing to help find a solution.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans are particularly sensitive about using police force to
re-take the UNAM campus and high schools from the students because
of the memory of the 1968 massacre of hundreds of students marching
for more democracy in a Mexico City square.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans still turn out by the tens of thousands to commemorate
the massacre, which took place during the presidency of Gustavo
Diaz Ordaz.
</P>
<P>
   Some voices, however, have called for the government to stop
using the massacre's memory as an excuse for failing to act more
aggressively to resolve the dispute peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't return to the times of resolving protests by using
bazookas to break down the doors of high schools,'' said Mexican
political commentator Sergio Sarmiento. ``However, there's a big
distance between the government violence of Gustavo Diaz Ordaz and
the current absence of authority when it comes to the UNAM
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   In a poll of 420 adults published this week by Reforma
newspaper, 34 percent said police should be deployed to roust the
striking students from the UNAM's installations. But 29 percent
said more dialogue should be used. Another 29 percent said that
anti-strike students should be allowed to re-take the campuses.

the Republican nomination, by a wounding 18 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The press hailed this always-hoped-for upset: praise be, a new
face for the front page. But McCain represents much more than that.
Given half a chance, he could bring some useful political upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   In a race that is being fought essentially over the Clinton
legacy, McCain appears as different from the incumbent as it is
possible to be.
</P>
<P>
   His demeanor is upright, even noble. He has a hero's past. Words
such as ``self-sacrifice'' and ``principle'' fit easily on him.
Audiences are surprised, even shocked, by his candor.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of his campaign is a drive to reform America's
election-finance laws, those same laws that President Bill Clinton
(with Al Gore, his heir apparent, assisting) flouted so routinely
on his way to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   McCain represents cleanness in every respect, from financing of
campaigns to an almost pathological aversion to lying, even to
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that his supporters see him as the knight-errant of
American politics, bravely aiming his lonely lance at special
interests and political establishments of every conceivable
venality.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a conservative Republican, lest that be forgotten,
with a perfect voting record in the Senate on issues dear to
conservatives' hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Although voters may not particularly care to notice, McCain is
the antithesis of Clinton not just in terms of character, but on
issues such as deregulation (fiercely for it) and abortion
(guardedly against it).
</P>
<P>
   He differs markedly on foreign policy, too. Where Clinton, at
least until the past year or so, had to be prodded to take a
reluctant interest in what the outside world was doing, McCain has
said he wishes foreign policy was the only issue in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   No shilly-shallying from him if he reaches the White House: when
the need arises and the cause is right, McCain wants you to
understand, he will not hesitate to commit America abroad and pay
the cost.
</P>
<P>
   But can he ever be president? At this point, intriguing factors
come into play.
</P>
<P>
   His victory in New Hampshire has come as a deep shock to the
Republican powers-that-be, who have staked everything on Bush. If
they look disinterestedly at the scene before them, they can
appreciate that they have in McCain, the Anti-Clinton, the perfect
candidate to take on Gore _ who, after squeaking past Bill Bradley,
now looks set for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will run rings around Gore on campaign finance and
ethics. He will effortlessly represent him as the epitome of the
bad old days. He will be a man without political IOUs, where Gore
and Bush have based their whole campaigns on them.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, McCain will be able to draw independent
voters towards the Republican Party. This was the key to much of
his success in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Registered independents now account for 15 percent of America's
electorate. The Jesse Ventura phenomenon, whereby another
celebrated anti-politician was elected governor of Minnesota, shows
that they have power.
</P>
<P>
   But they are not inevitably opposed to the two main parties:
given a candidate who shows spirit and piques their interest, as
McCain does, they will vote for him despite his Republican label.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, despite all this, the Republican establishment has big
problems with McCain. For surprisingly, under the surface steel,
they detect a soft heart on economic and fiscal matters: a heart
that is, in fact, Clintonite, and threatens to pull the Republican
Party in a new direction altogether.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two decades, especially since the Contract with
America, the Republicans have defined themselves by their devotion
to tax cuts. The likelihood of substantial budget surpluses has
encouraged them even more: Bush is offering $1.4 trillion-worth,
intended, as Republican tax cuts normally are, mostly to benefit
the rich.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has other plans. He wants to use the surpluses first to
pay down the national debt and to bolster Social Security, the
public-pensions system. After that, he proposes a modest tax cut
aimed mostly at the middle classes.
</P>
<P>
   The establishment is right: this is a proposal Clinton would be
proud of. Although the Republican Party has captured middle-class
votes before, famously under Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, it has
never chosen to present itself as a party that cares more for the
average man than for the rich.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is throwing open doors across class divides as well as
party lines, and this could shake up the Republicans for good.
</P>
<P>
   Could do; but perhaps not. For the fact is that McCain's road
out of New Hampshire is still all uphill. He has a shoestring
organization elsewhere, and other states are less likely to be
impressed by what amounts to a cheeky insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   He will enjoy the famous ``bounce'' for a while, of course. But
at the end of the day the party elders are very unlikely to abandon
Bush, to whom they have already pledged their organization and
their money if not, entirely, their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   McCain (in a metaphor he would appreciate) is a grenade-thrower
who could conceivably win them the White House. But to back him
requires a bravery they have not learned from him yet. &QL;

<P>
   Another month, another record. America's expansion has just
entered its 107th month, making it the longest on record.
</P>
<P>
   Such longevity is impressive _ though not unheard of (East Asia
grew for decades before its crash and Japan's economy roared for 15
years before its bubble burst in the early 1990s).
</P>
<P>
   Even more impressive is the nature of America's boom. This
expansion bears scant resemblance to its postwar predecessors, and
it has flouted several economic laws.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally in America, an unemployment rate of less than 5.5
percent has triggered inflationary pressures. The jobless rate has
been below 5 percent since July 1997; yet, until recently, wage and
price pressures have been conspicuously absent.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, productivity growth has slowed as expansions have
matured, with firms obliged to draw less-skilled workers from the
depleted pool of labor. But in this boom, productivity growth has
actually risen as the recovery has gone on.
</P>
<P>
   This has been, in short, a most unusual expansion. Yet the
biggest surprise may be still to come: how it ends, as it surely
will.
</P>
<P>
   Only the craziest of ``new economy'' cheerleaders _ and Wall
Street, apparently _ believe that the business cycle is dead. But
the cycle may indeed be changing.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation has been the trigger for nearly all postwar
recessions. As demand has surged, wages and prices have followed.
To stop them, the Federal Reserve has ``taken away the punch bowl''
by pushing up interest rates, tipping the economy into recession.
</P>
<P>
   That process explains why cautious observers, including The
Economist, complained about the Fed's unwillingness to raise
interest rates much earlier in this expansion. But, thanks largely
to two huge slices of good luck, in the form of Asia's crisis and
falling commodity prices, these concerns proved premature.
</P>
<P>
   They are now back with a vengeance. The economy's pace is
producing clear inflationary pressure, with the core consumption
deflator rising at an annualized 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter
of 1999, the fastest for almost five years, and employment costs up
by 3.4 percent in the year to the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Given this, the Federal Reserve was bound to raise short-term
interest rates this week _ and it would have been wiser to lift
them by more than the quarter-point that it opted for.
</P>
<P>
   More rate rises are sure to be needed to rein in demand. And it
is possible that this will mean the expansion dies a conventional
postwar death after all.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a different demise is also quite possible _ one that has
little to do with inflation. Its antecedents lie in prewar periods
of technological innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, booms ended in busts when bubbles of undue exuberance
popped, exposing underlying economic fragilities. Investment and
borrowing that had seemed reasonable when asset prices were soaring
suddenly became millstones round the economy's neck.
</P>
<P>
   The parallels between America in the 1920s and the 1990s _ rapid
technological innovation, booming investment, dizzy asset prices _
are uncomfortably clear. And it is not hard to find the imbalances
that might trigger the shift from boom to bust.
</P>
<P>
   Personal saving is low and falling, as consumers spend their
stock market gains. Debt levels, both corporate and personal, are
rising fast; they seem tolerable only if one assumes that asset
prices stay very high.
</P>
<P>
   With a current-account deficit near 4 percent of GDP, America
remains dangerously reliant on foreigners' willingness to buy
dollar assets.
</P>
<P>
   The risks of a bust are real, and the prospect is unnerving: the
two closest previous examples _ America after 1929 and Japan after
1989 _ were not pretty. But history need not repeat itself, for
sensible policy can stop a bust turning into a slump.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscal policy is in good shape; so long as the budget surplus is
not frittered away by new spending or big tax cuts, it offers
plenty of firepower should private demand suddenly plummet.
</P>
<P>
   Under those conditions, looser monetary policy could also be a
useful tool. Firmer action than the Fed has taken to cool the
economy (and dampen exuberance) now, however, would make sense:
with luck, it would lessen any burden placed on such remedies
later. &QL;

NOTAH BEGAY: TRUE AMERICAN HERO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You are never too old for heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that's hero, as defined thusly in Webster's Third
International Dictionary: ``A man (or woman, of course) admired for
his achievements and noble qualities and considered a model or
ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   Hero worship is dangerous. You never want to worship. But if
there aren't people to admire, what kind of a world is this?
</P>
<P>
   Finding sports heroes to admire is a loaded topic. It's
certainly easy to find enough people whose exploits in the
competitive arena are worthy of admiration. Believe me, if I wanted
to educate some 6-foot-10-inch youngster on the science of
rebounding, there is only one contemporary player whose videos I'd
select. It's just too bad the scientific rebounder in question is
the personally loathsome Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes people are hopelessly complex and, therefore, almost
unjudgeable. What, for example, should we make of Jim Brown, the
man, as opposed to Jim Brown, arguably the greatest running back of
all time, not to mention one of the handful of greatest athletes
ever produced by this, or any other, country? Jim Brown has done
much admirable youth work. He is a tremendous spokesman for the
plight of inner-city kids. He is also a serial abuser of females.
If we choose to elevate him to the status of hero, we are forced to
take the entire troubling package.
</P>
<P>
   Some great players were pure _ I think. Who has ever heard a bad
word about Stan Musial? Ernie Banks? John Havlicek? Bobby Orr? But
anyone who digs deeply enough can probably find something (e.g. a
child born out of wedlock) that would sully someone in the eyes of
somebody.
</P>
<P>
   Legitimate all-around sports heroes are always in short supply,
but I think we now have one. Henceforth, I root for Notah Begay to
win every golf tournament he enters.
</P>
<P>
   Notah Begay is the Native American member of the PGA Tour who
came into prominence last year by winning a pair of tournaments. He
is the first Native American PGA Tour member, which means he is a
revered man in Native American circles.
</P>
<P>
   He should be a revered man in just about any American circle,
because he is one of the few athletes in modern times capable of
grasping a concept known as accountability.
</P>
<P>
   The denouement will come in the first week of March when, rather
than participating in the Doral Open, Notah Begay will spend a week
as a guest of the state of Arizona. He'll get three squares a day,
but the accommodations will be less than lavish and his movements
will be somewhat restricted. Capisce?
</P>
<P>
   As quoted by Jeff Williams of Newsday, this is how Notah Begay
explained his situation to a group of young children and their
parents at a recent golf clinic. ``You are looking at someone who
is going to jail,'' Begay told them. ``I was picked up for drunk
driving. Do you know what drunk driving is?''
</P>
<P>
   Whoa. Where's the cheesy mouthpiece explaining that Mr. Begay
didn't murder anybody and is being singled out as an example due to
his celebrity? Where's the appeal? Where's the ``Don't you know who
I am?'' defense? Where's the big athlete ego? I mean, all he did
was have a few brewskis and then back a Ford Expedition _ driving a
hideously oversized SUV; now there's a crime _ into a '67 Jaguar,
denting a fender. For this, a man of Notah Begay's stature will
spend a week in jail, pay a $1,000 fine, perform 48 hours of
community service, and swear off alcohol for a year? A bit of
judicial overkill, no?
</P>
<P>
   Well, there's more to the story. Begay might have skated, except
that he (itals)volunteered(unitals) to the judge in question that
he had a similar conviction in Phoenix back in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a bad decision,'' he told the kids and their parents.
``I'm telling you from experience . . . just to say no. I would
hate to see any of you go through what I have to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK. But how many contemporary jocks would call down the
napalm on themselves, as it were?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want preferential treatment because of who I knew or
who I was,'' he said, again as reported by Jeff Williams. ``I told
them (about the prior conviction) because I felt I had a
responsibility to my fans, to Native Americans. I couldn't stand up
in front of a judge and be a hypocrite.''
</P>
<P>
   Notah Begay is a golfer who represents Notah Begay and only
Notah Begay. It is almost unimaginable that any modern team sport
athlete would act this way. The team would attempt to protect him.
The agent would attempt to protect him. The Players Association
would surely attempt to protect him. Team sport athletes are
products of a perverse culture that coddles the gifted among them
from adolescence, so much so that these men can enter adulthood
with 100 percent entitlement mentalities.
</P>
<P>
   But you get the feeling that Begay is a man of such good sense
and unquestioned integrity that he would emerge in a heroic manner
under any circumstance. He is so on top of all this that he will
submit himself to counseling, even though there is scant evidence
that he is an alcoholic or anything close to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident there is no serious issue,'' he said. ``But I
don't want to make that judgment about myself. I want a
professional to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   He is decent. He is honest. He is a great golfer. He is a flawed
human being. I would also submit that he is a man who should most
definitely be admired for both his achievements and his noble
qualities. Anyone looking for a true sports hero need look no
further.

BRUINS IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ What a long, strange trip it's been.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' season, which took a hiatus this weekend for the
All-Star break, has been one part ``Young and the Restless,'' one
part ``ER,'' one part ``Search for Tomorrow,'' and most recently,
one part ``Another World.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the reasons the season has been rocky have been
well-chronicled _ from holdouts, to letting certain players go, to
some players not living up to expectations, to coaching, to bad
chemistry. You name it, it's been discussed, dissected, and
analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   So, what now? With 28 games remaining in the regular season, the
Bruins are the ninth-best team in the Eastern Conference. In other
words, if the playoffs started today, they wouldn't be in them.
</P>
<P>
   When coach Pat Burns went into his postgame press conference
Thursday after the Bruins beat visiting Toronto, 4-2, he kidded
that he didn't want to see his players during the break and they
didn't want to see him. Truth be told, though, the team is actually
playing quite a bit better in recent days, save for a stinker
against Anaheim Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the timing is good,'' said Burns. ``I think the
feeling is good now. You go away with a good feeling. I think
that's going to carry over.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been plenty of not-so-good feelings this season _
from Byron Dafoe's contract problems at the start, to losing center
Jason Allison to injury, to the Joe Murphy saga that resulted in
him being suspended indefinitely for verbal abuse leveled at Burns.
Assistant general manager Mike O'Connell said the club is trying to
trade the player, but, as of late Friday afternoon, there was no
movement. O'Connell said that with Harry Sinden in Toronto for
meetings with the other GMs, something could develop.
</P>
<P>
   As for the remaining games, none will be easy. The Bruins' first
contest back is against the hot Washington Capitals Tuesday,
followed by a visit to the also-surging New York Rangers Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly think we should be pretty positive about things,
especially (after beating Toronto),'' said defenseman Don Sweeney.
``We've had an OK stretch. Granted, we haven't had a winning streak
like the Rangers and the Capitals have put together. But outside of
the Anaheim game, I think we've played the way we're capable of and
maybe the way we should be playing. We knew a test was in front of
us (against the Maple Leafs) and we hadn't played well at home and
we needed to establish the intensity we're going to have to play
with for the rest of the games.''
</P>
<P>
   One area where the Bruins had been hideous early in the season
was in their own end. It affected every aspect of the game. Lately,
that has settled down. And, dare we say it, the special teams have
improved.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jeremy Jacobs a week ago criticized the job Burns was
doing, especially with respect to the penalty killing. After the
Leafs went 0 for 4 on the man-advantage Thursday, Burns quipped,
``How about that penalty killing?''
</P>
<P>
   The team's more responsible effort defensively has led to
improvement across the board, although the Bruins don't have as
many victories to show for it as they might like.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pressuring the puck much better and using our skating
ability,'' said Sweeney. ``We're getting in and forcing teams.
We're not sitting back. As a result, we're not spending as much
time in our own end.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else comes of the recent success, it's the team's
hope that the soap-opera atmosphere that has produced tension all
season might finally go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be honest, you can point back right to the get-go in
terms of distractions in terms of players not being here and
players coming in and out,'' said Sweeney. ``We've not made any
excuses about the way we've played. A lot of things have led to us
not playing well at times. But for a while, we just weren't playing
the way we were supposed to be playing and we weren't executing. I
think everybody has really stepped up and said, `Take care of your
own individual game and what you bring to the table every night,'
and we'll let the chips fall where they may and we've had that
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all struggled at times. We haven't all been on the same
page. We weren't playing smart. We were making uncharacteristic
mistakes, we were turning the puck over and losing our positioning
in the defensive zone. We've just tightened those things up and I
think that's been a commitment from everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the unsung additions has been center Andre Savage. The
Bruins were center-poor with the loss of Allison, but Savage has
made a big difference since coming up from Providence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a very pleasant surprise,'' said Sweeney. ``He has a
real willingness to learn. He's a really good kid and he really
works hard. You like to see that, a person who cares, who comes in
and is part of a club and is unassuming and goes about his role.
Raymond (Bourque) has talked to him a lot. He's a good kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Others who have played key parts in the Bruins' turnaround have
been center Joe Thornton and new center Anson Carter. Thornton and
Carter have been mainstays every night, often doubleshifting, and
playing with myriad linemates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, I think Anson has stepped forward and accepted the
role that he needs to play every night,'' said Sweeney. ``He's
logged a lot of minutes in crucial times. Joe as well. When you
have guys playing out of position, you lose something. For a while,
we were doing that. Then we got back to basics. Everyone realized
they had to take care of their part of the ice and (Dafoe) will
take care of what breakdowns may occur.''
</P>
<P>
   After the weekend, the real grind continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to get easier,'' said Sweeney. ``We have to
enjoy the break, refocus, and realize what's ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   That promises to be the most interesting episode of all.

VOTING AND THE INTERNET: SO MUCH FOR `SECRET' BALLOTS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Internet campaign advertisements are all the rage.
George W. Bush, John McCain and Al Gore all have them, and Bill
Bradley recently launched a blitz of them.
</P>
<P>
   But people who care for privacy wonder about the targeting of
such ads, and whether the political allegiances of surfers on the
World Wide Web are being detected and made use of without their
consent.
</P>
<P>
   Attention is turning to Aristotle Publishing, whose clients
include the Bush and McCain campaigns. Aristotle uses publicly
available voter-registration records (the company says it has
nearly all the country's 145 million registered voters on file),
and a proprietary computer model to help campaigns target web ads
at people who are likely to vote for a particular party.
</P>
<P>
   Although voting records _ which can include information on
registered voters' names, addresses, telephone numbers, party
affiliation and whether they voted in particular elections _ have
long been used to identify loyalists and help get out the vote, the
Internet adds a troubling new dimension.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites often compile and share information on the browsing
practices of net-users by means of a small electronic name tag (a
``cookie'').
</P>
<P>
   Each time you visit the site, the cookie identifies you, tracks
what pages you visit and the data you enter, and records where you
were before and where you are heading next.
</P>
<P>
   Such information can be aggregated into huge direct-marketing
databases, creating a composite profile of an individual
Web-surfer's habits, often without his knowledge. Direct-marketers
can then use these data to place targeted ads in front of him as he
browses.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Potter, a former chairman of the Federal Election
Commission, says the ease of gathering information about voters in
this way calls for a reevaluation of the laws allowing public
access to voting records.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, it was extremely hard to assemble a nationwide
list. Campaign workers had to visit the office of the secretary of
state in all 50 states, and sometimes even had to trek to
individual counties, to photocopy voter lists.
</P>
<P>
   Computers and the Internet now make it child's play to find, and
update, this information.
</P>
<P>
   Aristotle's director of communications, Jay MacAniff, says the
company uses the voter database only for people who have already
agreed to receive commercial appeals online. He argues that the use
of telephone banks, door-to-door pitches and direct mail by
traditional campaigns poses a greater risk to voter privacy than a
model that simply guesses your allegiances.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary campaigns are left with a hard copy of the voter's
name, address and telephone number, he points out, whereas neither
Aristotle, nor any of its campaign clients, receives ``any
information whatsoever at all about the person who is served a
banner (ad), it's completely anonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics say that this does not entirely exonerate the
campaigns. ``If there's a Chinese wall over which campaigns don't
care to look, that's still morally objectionable,'' says Jason
Catlett of Junkbusters.com, an online watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're being surreptitiously identified as you browse the
Web, that violates the expectation of most surfers that they're
anonymous.'' It also could violate the expectation of voters who
have not registered a party affiliation because they wish to keep
their opinions private.
</P>
<P>
   Many people see disquieting shades of Big Brother in all this.
The Gore campaign has said that it will not hire Aristotle, or any
online ad firm that raises concerns about privacy, although the
campaign might use similar targeting techniques of its own.
</P>
<P>
   But is anyone's privacy really being violated? It is difficult
to tell, because no one seems to know exactly what Aristotle, or
the campaigns, are doing.
</P>
<P>
   Catlett of Junkbusters says the dearth of such information is
itself a problem, and a general openness is needed, especially
about the handling of personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Aristotle retorts that if browsers are worried, they should
simply turn their cookies off. But most Web surfers have no clue
how to do that; and cookies can serve useful purposes, such as
remembering passwords. Anyway, why put the burden on consumers?
</P>
<P>
   It is a violation of federal law for video-rental shops to
reveal a customer's taste in films, yet no such law applies to Web
sites. Perhaps one should. &QL;

   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ It has been eight weeks since crews
began transforming Jan Winford's quaint Riviera bungalow into a
handsome two-story homestead.
</P>
<P>
   But, oh, what a difference eight weeks make.
</P>
<P>
   In that time, workers have stripped the siding, removed windows
and doors, hauled away the front deck, built a new garage and front
window, started decorative stonework, created new exterior walls,
built half a staircase and framed the upstairs master suite.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the fast pace is the rigorous production schedule
of ``This Old House,'' the popular PBS home improvement show that
will feature this project on its next seven episodes. The first
episode will air Saturday. The project must be completed by the
time the show wraps up its 21st season in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   Local contractor Steve Crawford has run into a few surprises
along the way. He and his crew discovered the house's foundation
was uneven and had to be rebuilt, the chimney was cracked, and a
sandstone wall had to be removed and replaced after it fell over,
crushing a ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you dig into an old house, it always falls apart,'' said
series producer Bruce Irving. ``I have yet to find a house that
doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The builder is trying to salvage some of the 93-year-old
Craftsman home's original windows, doors and floorboards _ a
process that can take longer and cost more than starting from
scratch but is important to the sentimental homeowner.
</P>
<P>
   Winford, 55, is very much involved in the process and has been
working more than 40 hours a week picking out drawer pulls, meeting
with art glass dealers, filling out order forms, visiting the site
and checking architectural drawings along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a grueling pace,'' she said. ``There are a lot more
details than I thought. It isn't just, `Oh, yeah, I'll have one of
those in pink.'''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing crews tear apart her beloved home _ the home where she
raised her family _ has been an emotional experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cry every day, both in joy and sadness,'' she said. ``It
just seems very brutal.''
</P>
<P>
   But Norm Abram, master carpenter of the Boston-based ``This Old
House,'' offers some perspective on Winford's worries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a saying we kid about back home: `Before there can be
construction, there has to be destruction,''' he said. ``I think
the destruction is over, we're now in the construction phase.''
</P>
<P>
   The builders have just six more weeks to make the building
weather-tight, frame and put on the new roof, install windows and
doors, finish electrical work, complete rough plumbing upstairs,
wire the walls for telephones, and landscape the front yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to have to attack this pretty aggressively,''
Abram said.

 &HT;    Injuries sidelining NHL's biggest stars
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ It's a smaller World, after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought tickets to go and see Bruce Springsteen,'' Colorado
coach Bob Hartley said the other day. ``If the first part of his
show he gets crosschecked by his trumpeter and they come back 10
minutes later and say they will continue the show without him,
well, I feel I'm missing part of the reason I was there.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHL is holding its All-Star weekend here in the city that
seemingly dissects the sport's every turn. Problem is,
circumstances have prevented some of the league's mantel pieces
from making it.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo goalie Dominik Hasek made a grand one-game return from a
groin injury, then pronounced himself to be in too much pain to
perform.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's Peter Forsberg, the NHL's best all-around player, was
whacked in the head in a game against Vancouver and is getting bed
rest for a concussion and a gouge near his eye.
</P>
<P>
   Jaromir Jagr, the league's scoring machine, said two weeks ago
he would come despite a pulled stomach muscle, then injured his
thumb against the Thrashers last week and declared himself out,
then said Thursday night he will be in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I'm 100 percent healthy, especially skating,''
Jagr said. ``But I feel a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, so do league officials. The All-Star Game already
had taken some hits because of the format _ North America vs. the
World _ and the NHL's preference that every team have a
representative, left several deserving players at home. No Hasek,
no Forsberg and no Jagr on the World team would have been a
marketing catastrophe, especially with Sunday's game the first in
the NHL's ABC television package.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Jagr, commissioner Gary Bettman's statement _ ``The
All-Star Game will probably be the biggest and best that any sport
has ever seen'' _ sounded like a line from a used-car salesman.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis' Pierre Turgeon was knocked off the North America team
with torn ligaments in his thumb. But league officials tried to
keep the marquee value up by adding, among others, Mark Messier.
While being a lock Hall of Famer, even Messier said he doesn't
deserve to be at the game; his nine goals rank ninth on the
Canucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was as surprised as anybody,'' Messier said. ``When I first
started, you had to have a good year and a solid year.
</P>
<P>
   Give the NHL credit for snuffing out one blaze. When St. Louis'
Roman Turek was snubbed for the World team despite leading European
goalies in victories, goals-against average and saves percentage,
Turek said, ``If they call me next week or the week after and say,
`Hey, Dominik is not coming,' I'm not going. I'll spend the time
with my family.'' But league vice president Colin Campbell
persuaded him to change his mind, and Turek is in Toronto as
Hasek's replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very good for me,'' Turek says now.
</P>
<P>
   Among those playing in front of Turek will be fellow Czech and
Thrashers rookie defenseman Petr Buzek.
</P>
<P>
   Buzek said a few absences won't depress him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to playing with everybody,'' he said. ``There
are so many good players, and everybody is a big star.''

 &HT;    ALL-STAR NOTEBOOK
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The most confusing set of standings in professional
sports apparently is not going to change.
</P>
<P>
   NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said he is a big fan of the
league's new four-on-four overtime format and has no plans to do
away with awarding a point in the standings to teams that lose in
the extra period. The NHL this season created a new category in the
standings for ``regulation ties'' or ``RT.'' A team losing in
overtime gets one added in the loss and RT columns. Consequently,
adding up all four columns (including wins and losses) makes it
seem the team has played more games than it actually has.
</P>
<P>
   There may be a push by some to keep the four-on-four format but
stop awarding points to overtime losers. But Bettman said,
``Playing four on four isn't what makes (overtime) so good by
itself. It is the four on four coupled with the fact that each team
already has a point. Now they are playing to win a point and the
combination works.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 27 percent of the games that went into overtime last season
resulted in a winner. This season, 43.4 percent of OT games have
been decided.
</P>
<P>
   _ All in the family _ Thrashers rookie Jason Botterill didn't
make it to Toronto but his sister did. Jennifer Botterill plays for
the Canadian national women's team and participated in an
exhibition Friday night against the U.S. in a rematch of the
gold-medal game in Nagano.
</P>
<P>
   _Local contingent _ A number of Thrasher officials made the
trip, including general manager Don Waddell and team president Stan
Kasten. Also here: former NHLer Tim Ecclestone, a long-time Atlanta
resident who played in the 1971 All-Star Game at Boston Garden.
Ecclestone, was with St. Louis at the time, regretted not bringing
his wife on that trip. So he surprised her with a trip to Toronto
for her birthday. Ecclestone's ``TJ's'' sports bar in Alpharetta
also is having an All-Star party for the public Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Substitute _ Florida's Ray Whitney, who was added to the North
America team to replace St. Louis's injured Pierre Turgeon, wasn't
sure what to think when Panthers assistant general manager Chuck
Fletcher phoned him at home Thursday morning. ``(My fiancee) Brijet
answered the phone at 9 o'clock,'' Whitney said. ``Her heart
started pumping a mile a minute because she thought we were
traded.'' Whitney actually has a strained lower-back that he says
will keep him out of today's skills competition, but he says he can
play. ``I had a great vacation planned,'' he said. ``But I can go
to Little Palm Island'' (in the Florida keys) any time. This could
be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I was looking forward to the
days off, but when you get a chance like this, you pack everything
up and go.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Internet campaign advertisements are all the rage.
George W. Bush, John McCain and Al Gore all have them, and Bill
Bradley recently launched a blitz of them.
</P>
<P>
   But people who care for privacy wonder about the targeting of
such ads, and whether the political allegiances of surfers on the
World Wide Web are being detected and made use of without their
consent.
</P>
<P>
   Attention is turning to Aristotle Publishing, whose clients
include the Bush and McCain campaigns. Aristotle uses publicly
available voter-registration records (the company says it has
nearly all the country's 145 million registered voters on file),
and a proprietary computer model to help campaigns target web ads
at people who are likely to vote for a particular party.
</P>
<P>
   Although voting records _ which can include information on
registered voters' names, addresses, telephone numbers, party
affiliation and whether they voted in particular elections _ have
long been used to identify loyalists and help get out the vote, the
Internet adds a troubling new dimension.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites often compile and share information on the browsing
practices of net-users by means of a small electronic name tag (a
``cookie'').
</P>
<P>
   Each time you visit the site, the cookie identifies you, tracks
what pages you visit and the data you enter, and records where you
were before and where you are heading next.
</P>
<P>
   Such information can be aggregated into huge direct-marketing
databases, creating a composite profile of an individual
Web-surfer's habits, often without his knowledge. Direct-marketers
can then use these data to place targeted ads in front of him as he
browses.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Potter, a former chairman of the Federal Election
Commission, says the ease of gathering information about voters in
this way calls for a reevaluation of the laws allowing public
access to voting records.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, it was extremely hard to assemble a nationwide
list. Campaign workers had to visit the office of the secretary of
state in all 50 states, and sometimes even had to trek to
individual counties, to photocopy voter lists.
</P>
<P>
   Computers and the Internet now make it child's play to find, and
update, this information.
</P>
<P>
   Aristotle's director of communications, Jay MacAniff, says the
company uses the voter database only for people who have already
agreed to receive commercial appeals online. He argues that the use
of telephone banks, door-to-door pitches and direct mail by
traditional campaigns poses a greater risk to voter privacy than a
model that simply guesses your allegiances.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary campaigns are left with a hard copy of the voter's
name, address and telephone number, he points out, whereas neither
Aristotle, nor any of its campaign clients, receives ``any
information whatsoever at all about the person who is served a
banner (ad), it's completely anonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics say that this does not entirely exonerate the
campaigns. ``If there's a Chinese wall over which campaigns don't
care to look, that's still morally objectionable,'' says Jason
Catlett of Junkbusters.com, an online watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're being surreptitiously identified as you browse the
Web, that violates the expectation of most surfers that they're
anonymous.'' It also could violate the expectation of voters who
have not registered a party affiliation because they wish to keep
their opinions private.
</P>
<P>
   Many people see disquieting shades of Big Brother in all this.
The Gore campaign has said that it will not hire Aristotle, or any
online ad firm that raises concerns about privacy, although the
campaign might use similar targeting techniques of its own.
</P>
<P>
   But is anyone's privacy really being violated? It is difficult
to tell, because no one seems to know exactly what Aristotle, or
the campaigns, are doing.
</P>
<P>
   Catlett of Junkbusters says the dearth of such information is
itself a problem, and a general openness is needed, especially
about the handling of personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Aristotle retorts that if browsers are worried, they should
simply turn their cookies off. But most Web surfers have no clue
how to do that; and cookies can serve useful purposes, such as
remembering passwords. Anyway, why put the burden on consumers?
</P>
<P>
   It is a violation of federal law for video-rental shops to
reveal a customer's taste in films, yet no such law applies to Web
sites. Perhaps one should. &QL;

MCENROE-LED DAVIS CUP TEAM HAS ROUGH FIRST DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ If John McEnroe feels as Black and blue as he
looks, here's why: On the first day of the rest of his life as
sideline sage of the US Davis Cup force, he ran into the Brothers
Black and was left reeling in the din and despair of a crowded
rumpus room called the City Sports Centre.
</P>
<P>
   Once the terror of the court and now a 40-year-old tyro of the
bench, McEnroe rated himself harshly _ a failure _ after the
opening day split that could be a massive crash in the making for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   During one of the more uproarious afternoons of American Davis
Cupping, drums thundered incessantly. A white-uniformed cheering
squad of 40, led by a jolly clown, ran unending dance-and-rah-rah
routines, sparking the partisan gathering of 4,000 to great volumes
and flag-swishing encouragement to the Blacks: victorious Byron and
losing Wayne. They were loud, but not out of line.
</P>
<P>
   A rainstorm found holes in the tin roof, just as longtime Cup
hero Byron found holes in leaky Chris Woodruff, to pull Zimbabwe
even, 1-1, after Andre Agassi's victory over Wayne Black. Some
mopping up had to be done, by ball boys with towels _ and by Byron,
two-fisted on both sides with his gut-strong mop, 7-6 (7-2), 6-3,
6-1, while dazing Woodruff and McEnroe.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-7 Wayne and 5-foot-9 Byron grew up sprightly amid the
fruit trees of a farm in Mandara, only 20 minutes from the compact
downtown Harare arena. Together they've lifted Zimbabwe to
prominence, the sole African country in the Cup's exclusive 16, the
World Group.
</P>
<P>
   The lone illustrious player in this first-round, best-of-five
series, No. 1 Agassi was strictly the warmup act as far as most
witnesses were concerned. Although Wayne, 26, played extremely
well, with a bounding kick serve and early returns, Agassi was as
sharp as he had to be, 7-5, 6-3, 7-5, serving oppressively: 12
aces, 13 winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre kept me on the run and gave me no place to serve to,''
shrugged Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1-0 for the United States. The situation was looking good
for Woodruff, the unexpected tourist from Tennessee, until
30-year-old Byron worked himself into the form ``I've been
preparing for over the last three to four months. This is one of
the greatest moments in Zimbabwe sporting history, to have the US
here, and I wanted to be ready to go all out.''
</P>
<P>
   So he did, his flat double-handed groundies cutting angles and
streaking along the lines on a swift hard court that is as much his
back yard as the grass rectangle among the avocados where he and
Wayne launched their careers.
</P>
<P>
   As he grooved, Woodruff groped, a victim not only of Byron, but
of Cup debut whim-whams.
</P>
<P>
   And, suddenly, the two most important American tennis players
are 35-year-old Rick (``I never thought I'd play Davis Cup again'')
Leach and a 29-year-old nomad of many partners, Alex O'Brien. Leach
&AMP; O'Brien are the newly minted doubles firm on which US survival
depends Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   According to McEnroe, ``If they come through'' against Wayne
Black and obscure Kevin Ullyett, ``we become overwhelming favorites
again, with Andre against Byron in the opener Sunday. If they
don't, Chris and I are gonna have to figure out a way to win that
fifth match over Wayne.''
</P>
<P>
   The doubles match is obviously pivotal, the series amazingly to
be decided by four virtually unknown guys.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe, appearing unhappy at that prospect, lamented openly,
``I didn't do a good job. I'm new at this, and I guess I needed a
period of adjustment. It was a learning experience for Chris and
me, newcomers. Deep in my heart I didn't do a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   But at what? Masterminding?
</P>
<P>
   Transition is a painful surprise. From celebrator of himself as
an all-time great performer, he is now an unarmed celebrator on
behalf of others. Even though McEnroe had 12 years of Cup
experience, they were devoted to beating people by himself, with
his racket and athleticism. He was in charge. Feeling the outcome
in his hands, he paid little attention to captains, and even
snubbed some. McEnroe needed no advice; he made it all happen.
Those days are gone. He can't play the points, and he misses that
strong suit while he tries to fit into this one.
</P>
<P>
   Now, advice for youngsters is his business. And ``I failed today
with Chris. I have to learn, to be able to help.''
</P>
<P>
   A humble, controlled McEnroe is on view, even in two brief
arguments (over line calls against Woodruff) with umpire Wayne
McKewen, for which he was soundly booed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I beat Woodruff on experience,'' said Byron. ``I've played 50
Cup singles matches (actually 36-13 over 14 years), and this was
his first. Chris didn't have much chance to prepare. It's tougher
on the road, what with a crowd like this. Early in my career, I
went through it in Morocco, and didn't handle it well. I'm ecstatic
to win, but sorry for Chris.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodruff, 27, selected only a week before when injured Pete
Sampras and ill Todd Martin dropped out, had only 30 hours in
Knoxville after flying home from Australia. He then flew here,
arriving Monday with his left arm aching from all the inoculations.
</P>
<P>
   He was doing all right until Byron (unbroken) slithered out of
two breakers at 3-4, 15-40, and ended the game with an ace and
service winner. Still, Woodruff was two points from winning the set
at 4-5, 30-all, a game the Zimbabwean won with a stinging backhand.
Into the tie-breaker they went, and out of the match went Woodruff.
He kept fighting but seemed bewildered, unreliable in his
shotmaking. A wild forehand and a double fault made it 4-1 for
Byron Black, who ran six points to 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Altitude and Cup nerves are a bad combination,'' Agassi said.
``I had trouble with the altitude, too (5,510 feet _ Harare lies on
a plateau). The ball flies when you don't want it to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If,'' said Woodruff, ``I'd broken his serve to get to 5-3, I
might have been all right.''
</P>
<P>
   As Woodruff departed the court, Byron was mobbed by jubilant
spectators, only to be rescued by security guards. ``I'm usually at
the bottom of the pile,'' he laughed. But he was on top when it
counted, and Woodruff and McEnroe walked away nursing Black
thoughts.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON AND WASHINGTON _ On Jan. 28 Europe's air-traffic control
bosses met some 38 transport ministers to unblock the continent's
gridlocked skies.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's antiquated air-traffic control is fragmented into 49
centers and 31 national systems. Its hardware uses 30 programming
languages and 22 operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   A third of all flights are delayed by more than 15 minutes, at a
cost to airlines and passengers of some $10 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   This latest summit was the sixth since the summer of 1989, when
delays in southern Europe almost brought the entire system to a
halt. But if past efforts are anything to go by, the talks are
likely to make about as much progress as a jumbo stacked up over
Heathrow.
</P>
<P>
   Fragmentation is not the only problem facing air-traffic
controllers. Although America has a single system of air-traffic
control, it too has seen delays climb steadily for five years.
</P>
<P>
   The cause is, simply, a booming market in air travel. Europe and
America may see a doubling of air travel over the next 10-15 years.
</P>
<P>
   According to Xavier Fron of Eurocontrol, which tries to
coordinate European air-traffic control, if capacity stays
constant, every 1 percent rise in traffic produces a 5 percent
increase in delays. So, unless air-traffic control improves hugely,
delays will grow longer and more frequent _ until demand is choked
off by the sheer hassle of flying.
</P>
<P>
   Safety is also at stake. So far, although the public-sector
mentality of air-traffic control has failed to respond to demand,
caution has at least ensured safety.
</P>
<P>
   Yet controllers reckon that the risk of a collision rises as a
square of any increase in traffic. This means that, if air traffic
doubles, a collision becomes four times as likely. If the number of
deaths from flying is not to rise dramatically, some way will have
to be found to reduce the risk of accidents.
</P>
<P>
   All this spells a need for overhaul and investment for which
neither Europe nor America show any sign of preparedness. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 275 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 350) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Take Europe first. Europe's airlines were excluded from last
week's meeting, even though passengers tend to blame them for
delays. An earlier meeting, on Jan. 12, between airline bosses and
air-traffic controllers turned into a dogfight as the businessmen
stacked up to aim salvoes at the bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   To the airlines' fury, controllers were promising merely to try
to make this summer's delays no worse than those of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Airline bosses such as Xavier de Irala of Iberia, who heads the
Association of European Airlines, and Jurgen Weber of Lufthansa,
weighed in with calls for a zero-defect approach to air-traffic
control, the standard that airlines expect from their other
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ayling, chief executive of British Airways, accused
Eurocontrol of a Soviet-style attitude, with its calls for
collaboration in ``strategic planning of demand.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory the current mess should never have started. Forty
years ago, Europe planned to run air-traffic control through only
three centers, Shannon in western Ireland, Karlsruhe in Germany and
Maastricht, where Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany meet.
</P>
<P>
   The entire continent was to be overseen by Eurocontrol. But
European governments refused to compromise their own airspace
(about as acceptable as a European army, comments one controller).
</P>
<P>
   Thus Europe's air-traffic control is condemned to work at the
speed of its slowest member, as pilots are handed over from one
country's system to another every 30-60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Eurocontrol runs only the Maastricht center, doing its pitiful
best to choreograph the other parts of the system. The rest of the
time it is little more than a talking-shop. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission is trying to bash heads together, but
Europe's single market does not yet show much sign of becoming a
single sky.
</P>
<P>
   Demands for change are growing in America, too. Congestion is
especially bad in the northeastern corner of the United States,
where it is approaching European levels.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse in America is the growing use of small
regional jet aircraft to feed from small towns into airport hubs.
</P>
<P>
   Although these aircraft fly faster and higher in the busy jet
lanes than did their turbo-prop predecessors, they are still slower
than big jets. They act, in effect, like caravans holding up road
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the entire country was in chaos. The trouble
started in April when the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
began installing new display monitors in control towers, beginning
with Seattle and working eastwards.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the overhaul had reached the busy airspace between
Indianapolis and Detroit, confusion was growing, as controllers
wanted to feel their way with the new color displays.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of the airlines, control towers began
unilaterally to impose a separation of 60 nautical miles between
aircraft, irrespective of their altitude. Normally, safety dictates
that flights be separated by five nautical miles or 2,000 feet
vertically.
</P>
<P>
   Then the summer thunderstorms arrived. In busy airports, such as
Detroit, Dallas-Fort Worth and Chicago's O'Hare, the number and
duration of flight delays doubled. On average, 1,500 out of some
22,000 scheduled airline flights a day were held up, leaving
100,000 passengers fuming in lounges or sweltering on the hot
tarmac.
</P>
<P>
   The public outcry was bitter. The cost, according to the
airlines, was about $5 billion for the industry and its customers.
</P>
<P>
   By autumn, the air was thicker with accusations than aircraft.
The airlines blamed the FAA and the air-traffic controllers; the
FAA blamed the sheer weight of traffic and federal-budget caps;
and, for their part, the controllers (revealingly) blamed the
airlines for scheduling so many flights at peak hours, when people
actually want to fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot afford to have that kind of summer again,'' says
Rodney Slater, America's transportation secretary.
</P>

   His idea is to boost investment in America by getting airlines

congressional proposals for re-regulating air travel.

<P>

   What to do? Technology might help somewhat. The Americans are
trying to use e-mail for routine ground-to-air communication,
freeing voice channels and lightening the load for controllers.
</P>
<P>
   Precise satellite navigation could remove the need for aircraft
to fly longer routes that were partly designed around the old
system of ground-radio beacons.
</P>
<P>
   David Barrett, of Gemini Consulting in London, thinks that,
eventually, a solution would be to replace human air-traffic
controllers with computers. It would also help if the controllers
and airlines would learn to collaborate with each other.
</P>
<P>
   From March 12, airline and FAA officials working from the FAA's
national control center at Herndon, Va., will work out how to react
to the coming weather. They will update their plans every two
hours, taking advantage of improvements to lift ground-holding
orders.
</P>
<P>
   But administrative reforms are also needed. The priority in
Europe should be a unified system. After 40 years of failure,
governments and the EU are unlikely to achieve this quickly. But
making air-traffic control more commercial might.
</P>
<P>
   One possible way is to encourage successful air-traffic-control
agencies to bid for the franchise to run national systems. Another
idea is to create different levels of service, so that a business
airline could pay to avoid delays that cheaper airlines might
tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should full privatization be taboo, so long as the
responsibility for safety is handed to an independent regulator.
</P>
<P>
   Germany has followed Canada and New Zealand in making its
air-traffic control commercial. Britain plans to go further by
selling half the shares in its National Air Traffic Service to
private investors. Yet such reforms remain the exception.
</P>
<P>
   American airline bosses, such as Gordon Bethune of Continental
Airlines and Don Carty of American Airlines, have called for
America's service to be privatized. But that is still a political
non-starter.
</P>
<P>
   Although everyone accepts there is a problem, they are not yet
ready to accept the solution. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON AND WASHINGTON _ On Jan. 28 Europe's air-traffic control
bosses met some 38 transport ministers to unblock the continent's
gridlocked skies.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's antiquated air-traffic control is fragmented into 49
centers and 31 national systems. Its hardware uses 30 programming
languages and 22 operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   A third of all flights are delayed by more than 15 minutes, at a
cost to airlines and passengers of some $10 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   This latest summit was the sixth since the summer of 1989, when
delays in southern Europe almost brought the entire system to a
halt. But if past efforts are anything to go by, the talks are
likely to make about as much progress as a jumbo stacked up over
Heathrow.
</P>
<P>
   Fragmentation is not the only problem facing air-traffic
controllers. Although America has a single system of air-traffic
control, it too has seen delays climb steadily for five years.
</P>
<P>
   The cause is, simply, a booming market in air travel. Europe and
America may see a doubling of air travel over the next 10-15 years.
</P>
<P>
   According to Xavier Fron of Eurocontrol, which tries to
coordinate European air-traffic control, if capacity stays
constant, every 1 percent rise in traffic produces a 5 percent
increase in delays. So, unless air-traffic control improves hugely,
delays will grow longer and more frequent _ until demand is choked
off by the sheer hassle of flying.
</P>
<P>
   Safety is also at stake. So far, although the public-sector
mentality of air-traffic control has failed to respond to demand,
caution has at least ensured safety.
</P>
<P>
   Yet controllers reckon that the risk of a collision rises as a
square of any increase in traffic. This means that, if air traffic
doubles, a collision becomes four times as likely. If the number of
deaths from flying is not to rise dramatically, some way will have
to be found to reduce the risk of accidents.
</P>
<P>
   All this spells a need for overhaul and investment for which
neither Europe nor America show any sign of preparedness. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 275 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 350) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Take Europe first. Europe's airlines were excluded from last
week's meeting, even though passengers tend to blame them for
delays. An earlier meeting, on Jan. 12, between airline bosses and
air-traffic controllers turned into a dogfight as the businessmen
stacked up to aim salvoes at the bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   To the airlines' fury, controllers were promising merely to try
to make this summer's delays no worse than those of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Airline bosses such as Xavier de Irala of Iberia, who heads the
Association of European Airlines, and Jurgen Weber of Lufthansa,
weighed in with calls for a zero-defect approach to air-traffic
control, the standard that airlines expect from their other
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ayling, chief executive of British Airways, accused
Eurocontrol of a Soviet-style attitude, with its calls for
collaboration in ``strategic planning of demand.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory the current mess should never have started. Forty
years ago, Europe planned to run air-traffic control through only
three centers, Shannon in western Ireland, Karlsruhe in Germany and
Maastricht, where Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany meet.
</P>
<P>
   The entire continent was to be overseen by Eurocontrol. But
European governments refused to compromise their own airspace
(about as acceptable as a European army, comments one controller).
</P>
<P>
   Thus Europe's air-traffic control is condemned to work at the
speed of its slowest member, as pilots are handed over from one
country's system to another every 30-60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Eurocontrol runs only the Maastricht center, doing its pitiful
best to choreograph the other parts of the system. The rest of the
time it is little more than a talking-shop. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission is trying to bash heads together, but
Europe's single market does not yet show much sign of becoming a
single sky.
</P>
<P>
   Demands for change are growing in America, too. Congestion is
especially bad in the northeastern corner of the United States,
where it is approaching European levels.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse in America is the growing use of small
regional jet aircraft to feed from small towns into airport hubs.
</P>
<P>
   Although these aircraft fly faster and higher in the busy jet
lanes than did their turbo-prop predecessors, they are still slower
than big jets. They act, in effect, like caravans holding up road
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the entire country was in chaos. The trouble
started in April when the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
began installing new display monitors in control towers, beginning
with Seattle and working eastwards.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the overhaul had reached the busy airspace between
Indianapolis and Detroit, confusion was growing, as controllers
wanted to feel their way with the new color displays.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of the airlines, control towers began
unilaterally to impose a separation of 60 nautical miles between
aircraft, irrespective of their altitude. Normally, safety dictates
that flights be separated by five nautical miles or 2,000 feet
vertically.
</P>
<P>
   Then the summer thunderstorms arrived. In busy airports, such as
Detroit, Dallas-Fort Worth and Chicago's O'Hare, the number and
duration of flight delays doubled. On average, 1,500 out of some
22,000 scheduled airline flights a day were held up, leaving
100,000 passengers fuming in lounges or sweltering on the hot
tarmac.
</P>
<P>
   The public outcry was bitter. The cost, according to the
airlines, was about $5 billion for the industry and its customers.
</P>
<P>
   By autumn, the air was thicker with accusations than aircraft.
The airlines blamed the FAA and the air-traffic controllers; the
FAA blamed the sheer weight of traffic and federal-budget caps;
and, for their part, the controllers (revealingly) blamed the
airlines for scheduling so many flights at peak hours, when people
actually want to fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot afford to have that kind of summer again,'' says
Rodney Slater, America's transportation secretary.
</P>
<P>
   His idea is to boost investment in America by getting airlines
to pay user charges. Others were less restrained. There were calls
for an air passengers' ``bill of rights'' and, briefly, even some
congressional proposals for re-regulating air travel.

FIREPOND IPO GAINS 350 PERCENT ON SENDOFF DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FirePond Inc., a small Waltham, Mass. Web-based software company
that helps companies respond to customers over the Internet as well
as through more established distribution channels, scorched Wall
Street Friday when its initial public offering of stock climbed
from 22 to close at 100 1/4, up 78 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly 356 percent increase was cause for celebration at the
firm _ which has 350 employees _ and was another indication of the
demand for companies involved in e-commerce, whether they make
money or not. FirePond Inc., posted a net loss of $28.85 million on
sales of $34.28 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just indicative of the market we are in,'' said Stephen
Lacey, managing editor of the IPO Reporter, a New York-based
newsletter. Lacey said ``it is definitely the case'' that many of
the investors who scooped up FirePond stock Friday had little or no
understanding of what it is the company does. But the limited
number of shares _ in this case 5 million _ help fuel the frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   FirePond provides software which allows companies with complex
products _ such as General Motors, John Deere, Sikorsky Aircraft,
Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, and Renault _ to react to
customer demands whether over the Internet, or through traditional
distribution channels such as a sales force.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the impressive clientele list, last year's losses
dwarfed the $9 million loss posted in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we are very exicted,'' said Klaus Besier, president
and chief executive of FirePond. Besier came to the 17-year-old
company two years ago. ``This indicates there is a strong demand to
the type of solution we offer to the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to participate in e-commerce selling and we
allow corporations to move from pure b-to-b models to e-commerce
b-to-b models,'' Besier said.
</P>
<P>
   The run-up, while impressive, did not match the first day
increases of two other local companies Akamai and Sycamore, which
saw their stock prices rise 458 percent and 486 percent
respectively on their first day of trading last year.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the company ended the day with a robust $3.3
billion in market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   The managing underwriters of the offering are FleetBoston
Robertson Stephens Inc., Dain Rauscher Wessels, SG Cowen, and
EOffering. They have the option of purchasing another 750,000
shares from the company and a stockholder for covering
over-allotments.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``lock-up period'' in which company insiders
cannot sell shares of the stock runs for 90 days.

 &HT;    Maverick tradition: McCain should heed fate of 1940 GOP nominee
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In politics, it's said that reformers shine brightly
but briefly, illuminating the heavens with their intense glow then
fading into obscurity. That fate is said to be in store for John
McCain, the fiery senator from Arizona who this week trounced Texas
Gov. George W. Bush in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes ... sometimes the reformer's meteor burns hot
enough, long enough to carry him into the history books. It did in
1976, when Jimmy ``I'll never lie to you'' Carter rode the
post-Watergate revulsion of politics right into the White House.
Like Carter, McCain is casting himself as the straight-shooting,
tell-it-like-it-is alternative at a time when Americans are
perceived to be sick and tired of spin, half-truths and outright
lies. However, history offers a candidate with far stronger
parallels to McCain and a campaign with more intriguing clues as to
what this 2000 election might hold.
</P>
<P>
   The name of Wendell Willkie may ring a vague bell in some
memories and none at all in many. A utility executive, Willkie ran
for the 1940 Republican presidential nomination as a maverick
outsider, a swashbuckling candidate who dared to tell people the
truth. And people adored him for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The curse of democracy today ... is that everybody has been
trying to please the public,'' Willkie said. ``Almost nobody ever
gets up and says what he thinks.'' He talked openly with the press,
holding court with them in hotel rooms or train cars. ``Ask me any
damn thing in the world, and I'll answer it,'' he used to tell
them.
</P>
<P>
   Writers who covered his campaign recalled how he would wander
into the press room, ``drink in hand, on the prowl for
companionship,'' and that accessibility paid dividends. ``More than
anything, it was Willkie's massive and highly favorable exposure in
the public prints that made him a national political force,''
author Steve Neal wrote in ``Dark Horse,'' his 1984 biography of
Willkie.
</P>
<P>
   Like McCain, Willkie took on the Republican Party establishment.
The GOP leadership at the time was dominated by isolationists who
advocated neutrality in the war already under way in Europe, a
stance Willkie condemned as cowardly and dangerous. Even back then,
Republicans tended to select their presidential nominees almost by
birthright. Willkie's main opponent at the 1940 GOP convention _
the man most of the pundits predicted would be the nominee _ was
Robert Taft, son of ex-President William Howard Taft.
</P>
<P>
   Stop me if this is beginning to sound familiar.
</P>
<P>
   The city where the McCain and Willkie stories may diverge is
Philadelphia, site of both the 1940 Republican Convention and the
upcoming 2000 convention. While Willkie emerged victorious from
Philadelphia, McCain may be lucky to still be a candidate by the
time he reaches the City of Brotherly Love.
</P>
<P>
   But Willkie's post-convention fate may nonetheless tell us
something about McCain. His free and easy speaking style began to
get Willkie in trouble as he made gaffe after gaffe on the campaign
trail. By alienating the Republican establishment, Willkie had also
denied himself access to campaign professionals. And professionals
have their uses. Willkie's amateurish campaign was poorly run,
which took its toll.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, Willkie's devotion to principle over politics,
the core of his appeal, began to waver under pressure. It had been
easy to act the maverick back when he was a dark horse with little
chance of winning, but with the presidency seemingly within his
grasp, Willkie began to play the political games that he had long
decried. To woo back Republicans, he even began to echo the
isolationist line. Soon his appeal began to fade. In the end,
Willkie drew 45 percent of the popular vote, to FDR's 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In exit polls in this week's New Hampshire primary, 63 percent
of Republican voters believed that McCain says what he really
believes and not just what people want to hear. Only 31 percent had
the same opinion of Bush. At the moment that reputation is McCain's
greatest treasure, the key to his popularity. But as the stakes
grow higher, so will the temptation to trim his sails, to play the
game. And if he does, history says he'll pay a heavy price.

<P>
   LONDON AND WASHINGTON _ On Jan. 28 Europe's air-traffic control
bosses met some 38 transport ministers to unblock the continent's
gridlocked skies.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's antiquated air-traffic control is fragmented into 49
centers and 31 national systems. Its hardware uses 30 programming
languages and 22 operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   A third of all flights are delayed by more than 15 minutes, at a
cost to airlines and passengers of some $10 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   This latest summit was the sixth since the summer of 1989, when
delays in southern Europe almost brought the entire system to a
halt. But if past efforts are anything to go by, the talks are
likely to make about as much progress as a jumbo stacked up over
Heathrow.
</P>
<P>
   Fragmentation is not the only problem facing air-traffic
controllers. Although America has a single system of air-traffic
control, it too has seen delays climb steadily for five years.
</P>
<P>
   The cause is, simply, a booming market in air travel. Europe and
America may see a doubling of air travel over the next 10-15 years.
</P>
<P>
   According to Xavier Fron of Eurocontrol, which tries to
coordinate European air-traffic control, if capacity stays
constant, every 1 percent rise in traffic produces a 5 percent
increase in delays. So, unless air-traffic control improves hugely,
delays will grow longer and more frequent _ until demand is choked
off by the sheer hassle of flying.
</P>
<P>
   Safety is also at stake. So far, although the public-sector
mentality of air-traffic control has failed to respond to demand,
caution has at least ensured safety.
</P>
<P>
   Yet controllers reckon that the risk of a collision rises as a
square of any increase in traffic. This means that, if air traffic
doubles, a collision becomes four times as likely. If the number of
deaths from flying is not to rise dramatically, some way will have
to be found to reduce the risk of accidents.
</P>
<P>
   All this spells a need for overhaul and investment for which
neither Europe nor America show any sign of preparedness. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 275 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 350) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Take Europe first. Europe's airlines were excluded from last
week's meeting, even though passengers tend to blame them for
delays. An earlier meeting, on Jan. 12, between airline bosses and
air-traffic controllers turned into a dogfight as the businessmen
stacked up to aim salvoes at the bureacrats.
</P>
<P>
   To the airlines' fury, controllers were promising merely to try
to make this summer's delays no worse than those of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Airline bosses such as Xavier de Irala of Iberia, who heads the
Association of European Airlines, and Jurgen Weber of Lufthansa,
weighed in with calls for a zero-defect approach to air-traffic
control, the standard that airlines expect from their other
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ayling, chief executive of British Airways, accused
Eurocontrol of a Soviet-style attitude, with its calls for
collaboration in ``strategic planning of demand.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory the current mess should never have started. Forty
years ago, Europe planned to run air-traffic control through only
three centers, Shannon in western Ireland, Karlsruhe in Germany and
Maastricht, where Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany meet.
</P>
<P>
   The entire continent was to be overseen by Eurocontrol. But
European governments refused to compromise their own airspace
(about as acceptable as a European army, comments one controller).
</P>
<P>
   Thus Europe's air-traffic control is condemned to work at the
speed of its slowest member, as pilots are handed over from one
country's system to another every 30-60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Eurocontrol runs only the Maastricht center, doing its pitiful
best to choreograph the other parts of the system. The rest of the
time it is little more than a talking-shop. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission is trying to bash heads together, but
Europe's single market does not yet show much sign of becoming a
single sky.
</P>
<P>
   Demands for change are growing in America, too. Congestion is
especially bad in the northeastern corner of the United States,
where it is approaching European levels.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse in America is the growing use of small
regional jet aircraft to feed from small towns into airport hubs.
</P>
<P>
   Although these aircraft fly faster and higher in the busy jet
lanes than did their turbo-prop predecessors, they are still slower
than big jets. They act, in effect, like caravans holding up road
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the entire country was in chaos. The trouble
started in April when the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
began installing new display monitors in control towers, beginning
with Seattle and working eastwards.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the overhaul had reached the busy airspace between
Indianapolis and Detroit, confusion was growing, as controllers
wanted to feel their way with the new color displays.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of the airlines, control towers began
unilaterally to impose a separation of 60 nautical miles between
aircraft, irrespective of their altitude. Normally, safety dictates
that flights be separated by five nautical miles or 2,000 feet
vertically.
</P>
<P>
   Then the summer thunderstorms arrived. In busy airports, such as
Detroit, Dallas-Fort Worth and Chicago's O'Hare, the number and
duration of flight delays doubled. On average, 1,500 out of some
22,000 scheduled airline flights a day were held up, leaving
100,000 passengers fuming in lounges or sweltering on the hot
tarmac.
</P>
<P>
   The public outcry was bitter. The cost, according to the
airlines, was about $5 billion for the industry and its customers.
</P>
<P>
   By autumn, the air was thicker with accusations than aircraft.
The airlines blamed the FAA and the air-traffic controllers; the
FAA blamed the sheer weight of traffic and federal-budget caps;
and, for their part, the controllers (revealingly) blamed the
airlines for scheduling so many flights at peak hours, when people
actually want to fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot afford to have that kind of summer again,'' says
Rodney Slater, America's transportation secretary.
</P>
<P>
   His idea is to boost investment in America by getting airlines
to pay user charges. Others were less restrained. There were calls
for an air passengers' ``bill of rights'' and, briefly, even some
congressional proposals for re-regulating air travel.
</P>
<P>
   In successfully seeing off these threats, the airlines have
promised to treat their delayed passengers better, by following a
voluntary code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the FAA has admitted that it uses airspace
inefficiently, responds slowly and clumsily to bad weather, and
suffers from procedures that vary from one region to the next. It
has also ordered an internal inquiry into air-traffic control. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,100. SECOND TRIM FOLLOWS TO 1,400) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   What to do? Technology might help somewhat. The Americans are
trying to use e-mail for routine ground-to-air communication,
freeing voice channels and lightening the load for controllers.
</P>
<P>
   Precise satellite navigation could remove the need for aircraft
to fly longer routes that were partly designed around the old
system of ground-radio beacons.
</P>
<P>
   David Barrett, of Gemini Consulting in London, thinks that,
eventually, a solution would be to replace human air-traffic
controllers with computers. It would also help if the controllers
and airlines would learn to collaborate with each other.
</P>
<P>
   From March 12, airline and FAA officials working from the FAA's
national control center at Herndon, Va., will work out how to react
to the coming weather. They will update their plans every two
hours, taking advantage of improvements to lift ground-holding
orders.
</P>
<P>
   But administrative reforms are also needed. The priority in
Europe should be a unified system. After 40 years of failure,
governments and the EU are unlikely to achieve this quickly. But
making air-traffic control more commercial might.
</P>
<P>
   One possible way is to encourage successful air-traffic-control
agencies to bid for the franchise to run national systems. Another
idea is to create different levels of service, so that a business
airline could pay to avoid delays that cheaper airlines might
tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should full privatization be taboo, so long as the
responsibility for safety is handed to an independent regulator.
</P>
<P>
   Germany has followed Canada and New Zealand in making its
air-traffic control commercial. Britain plans to go further by
selling half the shares in its National Air Traffic Service to
private investors. Yet such reforms remain the exception.
</P>
<P>
   American airline bosses, such as Gordon Bethune of Continental
Airlines and Don Carty of American Airlines, have called for
America's service to be privatized. But that is still a political
non-starter.
</P>
<P>
   Although everyone accepts there is a problem, they are not yet
ready to accept the solution. &QL;

   CAMPAIGN-PRIMARIES-REVIEW (Washington) _ After months in the
small states of Iowa and New Hampshire, the presidential campaign
turns national with an eye to March 7, a single day of voting so
big that candidates are calling it Titanic Tuesday. On this day,
more voters may have more influence over who is nominated than in
years. More than one third of eligible voters will get to
participate. The compressed calendar resembles a European election:
a short but intense primary season where, candidates hope, voters
pay close attention. March 7 will be the closest thing America has
to a national primary. By Richard L. Berke. (Moving in `a'

   AUSTRIA-EUROPE-REVIEW (Vienna) _ In the European psyche, Vienna
is dense with symbolism. Behind the waltzes-as-muzak and the cozy
cafes lies a darker reality on which Joerg Haider has played. That
reality includes Christian Vienna's long rearguard action against
the Turkish ``infidel,'' enthusiastic Austrian support for Hitler,
and the historical distortion that long portrayed Austria as the
first victim of Nazi aggression. All of this makes Europe uneasy.

malpractice and criminality. By Edward Wong.

<P>
   TV-SCIFI-REVIEW (Undated) _ When TV appeared in America's living
rooms, it seemed like a techno-wonder out of science fiction. But
for viewers expecting new horizons of literate entertainment and
provocative visions of the future, sci-fi TV has largely failed to
live up to its promise. In the 1960s, series like the ``The
Twilight Zone'' and ``The Outer Limits'' effectively mixed social
messages with simple special effects. ``Star Trek'' combined space
opera with memorable scripts. By not pandering to audiences, these
shows pulled science-fiction TV away from pulpy stories about
invading bug-eyed monsters. These days, however, channel surfers
are more likely to encounter fiction that has swapped ``science''
for ``sex'' to attract viewers. By J.D. Biersdorfer.

several magazines for running sex photos while conceding that the
magazines perform a useful service in their innovative

INDONESIA JITTERY OVER SHOWDOWN BETWEEN PRESIDENT AND TOP GENERAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The army commander warned Friday that a
standoff between the president and a top general had created a
``dangerous and uncertain'' situation and said that he was lobbying
with his men not to stage a coup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee that as an institution the army will not launch a
coup,'' said the commander, Gen. Tyasno Sudarto. But he seemed to
suggest that rogue officers could still take action, saying, ``I
have to be able to convince the army to remain solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Jakarta has been swept by rumors of a coup since Monday, when a
special commission recommended the indictment of the most prominent
general, Wiranto, as one of the officers responsible for the
carnage last year in East Timor. Violence swept East Timor, the
former Portuguese colony occupied by Indonesia for nearly 25 years,
before and after its people voted for independence from Indonesia
in August.
</P>
<P>
   After the commission reported, President Abdurrahman Wahid, who
is traveling abroad, immediately called on Wiranto to resign his
cabinet post as coordinating minister for security affairs. The
general refused, proclaimed his innocence and proceeded to attend a
cabinet meeting the next day.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono said that on the
instructions of the president he asked Wiranto directly on Thursday
to step down. Sudarsono said that the general made no response and
that the issue would have to wait until Feb. 13, when Wahid returns
from a trip to Europe and elsewhere in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The army commander's statement reflects a widely held view among
analysts that the military as an institution will obey civilian
rule but that there are restive officers who could act on their
own.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, though, the chief military spokesman was more
reassuring. ``I don't think it's dangerous,'' the spokesman, Air
Vice Marshal Graito Usodo, said. ``In fact, I can give you a
guarantee that while he is away there will be no coup or any sort
of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto has many supporters in the military, but he does not
command any troops. A number of ranking officers, as well as
civilian politicians, have spoken out in support of the president
and civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts agree that the backlash against a coup among
the public, foreign donors and financial markets would be
devastating. But many officers are chafing over the president's
efforts to reduce their political role and its accompanying
economic power. New moves to make them accountable for abuses in
East Timor and elsewhere have also created unhappiness in the
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office, the president has steadily moved to
undercut the influence of the politically powerful army, appointing
members of the more neutral navy and air force to top positions and
ousting some prominent officers who do not agree with him. He
reduced Wiranto's power by removing him last year as chief of the
armed forces and then requiring him to give up his military rank as
a cabinet member.
</P>
<P>
   The public nature of the confrontation and the fears it has
caused in this shaky nation caused tremors in the financial markets
that are crucial to Indonesia's recovery. Driven by rumors and
unanswered questions, the stock market and the value of the
currency tumbled this week but recovered somewhat Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see this as another uncertainty,'' the deputy governor
of Bank Indonesia, Miranda Goeltom, said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat said the public nature of the president's
blunt comments about Wiranto and the military seemed intended to
rally support, to demonstrate his confidence and to undermine any
plot against him.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in the Netherlands on Thursday, Wahid said: ``Last
night, we heard there was going to be a demonstration by Muslim
militants in Jakarta. We thought there might be dirty hands behind
that. I don't know if they were the generals' hands.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the military and the police had ``prevented the people
from gathering.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We made it known to them,'' Wahid added, that we are in full
control of the situation, we know their moves, and they have to be
careful.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the gloom that has descended over some of online
shopping's best and brightest, there is one big ``e-tailer'' whose
star shines more fiercely than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise is that this is no Silicon Valley digital hotshot,
but a dull old British grocer.
</P>
<P>
   Tesco, the most successful of Britain's big supermarket chains,
has just announced that it is creating 7,000 jobs as part of its
plans to expand its Internet home-shopping service.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 300,000 registered customers and sales of more than
Pounds2.5 million ($4.1 million) a week, Tesco already claims to be
the biggest Web grocer in the world. Even more amazingly, it is
profitable.
</P>
<P>
   At present, Tesco accepts online sales at 100 of its stores, but
soon that figure will rise to 300, giving it the ability to serve
more than 1 million home-shopping customers a week.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the secret of Tesco's early success. Instead of
building highly automated new warehouses dedicated to filling
online orders, the strategy of rivals such as Sainsbury's, Tesco is
exploiting its network of nearly 650 stores nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Tesco says this means online customers can buy as wide a range
of goods as they could in a store. Customers can also arrange more
convenient delivery times, because smaller vans are covering
shorter distances.
</P>
<P>
   And Tesco has been able to develop its online business faster
than have competitors that are creating parallel distribution
systems from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   When an order is received from the Tesco Direct Web site, it is
sent to the server computer at the store nearest the customer's
home.
</P>
<P>
   The order is first assigned to the van that is to deliver the
goods and then sent on to a ``picking trolley,'' a shopping cart
with a screen and ``shelf identifier'' software that takes the
picker to where each item is found.
</P>
<P>
   Because everything has to be scanned in, the picker cannot
accidentally select the wrong product. Once the trolley is loaded,
it goes straight to the van for delivery.
</P>
<P>
   The system works, but it is labor-intensive. The Pounds5 ($8.00)
that Tesco charges for home delivery is far less than the cost of
employing all the pickers and drivers.
</P>
<P>
   And when stores are crowded at weekends, which are when most
orders arrive, efficiency falls off further as pickers jostle their
way down aisles and queue like any other shopper.
</P>
<P>
   Tesco argues that it still makes a respectable margin on its
Internet sales, because the average Web shopping basket is worth
about Pounds100 ($165), much more than people normally spend when
they shop.
</P>
<P>
   And by adding other products, such as books and clothes, that
online customers seem more willing to mix with food than do
customers in the supermarket, the firm hopes to raise margins
further.
</P>
<P>
   It also claims that a significant part of its online sales is
incremental revenue that has come from slower-moving competitors.
Tesco has done extraordinarily well on the Net with a very modest
investment. But the cheap and cheerful approach will not work
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Tesco Direct runs on standard Microsoft BackOffice software and
inexpensive Dell servers, neither of which are really suited to the
heavy-lifting of an e-commerce site supporting many thousands of
concurrent users.
</P>
<P>
   Tesco Direct customers already complain of slow-loading pages
and crashes when demand is high.
</P>
<P>
   Even more fundamentally, unless Tesco can use the Web actually
to lower its distribution costs, online victories will tend to be
of the Pyrrhic variety.
</P>
<P>
   One important step will be to link the orders of each Web
shopper with every supplier by connecting Tesco Direct with its new
extranet. But to be a genuine e-commerce leader, Tesco will, before
long, have to build a first-class technology and logistical
infrastructure, including dedicated picking centers.
</P>
<P>
   Those 7,000 new jobs demonstrate that Tesco has not built an
Internet business that can ``scale,'' that is, grow without costs
growing too.
</P>
<P>
   Tesco may make few mistakes, but the timing and execution of
this transition are crucial. As retailers are finding out, the Web
is an unforgiving place. &QL;

sent to the server computer at the store nearest the customer's
home.
</P>
<P>
   The order is first assigned to the van that is to deliver the
goods and then sent on to a ``picking trolley,'' a shopping cart
with a screen and ``shelf identifier'' software that takes the
picker to where each item is found.
</P>
<P>
   Because everything has to be scanned in, the picker cannot
accidentally select the wrong product. Once the trolley is loaded,
it goes straight to the van for delivery.
</P>
<P>
   The system works, but it is labor-intensive. The Pounds5 ($8.00)
that Tesco charges for home delivery is far less than the cost of
employing all the pickers and drivers.
</P>
<P>
   And when stores are crowded at weekends, which are when most
orders arrive, efficiency falls off further as pickers jostle their
way down aisles and queue like any other shopper.
</P>
<P>
   Tesco argues that it still makes a respectable margin on its
Internet sales, because the average Web shopping basket is worth
about Pounds100 ($165), much more than people normally spend when
they shop.
</P>
<P>
   And by adding other products, such as books and clothes, that
online customers seem more willing to mix with food than do
customers in the supermarket, the firm hopes to raise margins
further.
</P>
<P>
   It also claims that a significant part of its online sales is
incremental revenue that has come from slower-moving competitors.
Tesco has done extraordinarily well on the Net with a very modest
investment. But the cheap and cheerful approach will not work
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Tesco Direct runs on standard Microsoft BackOffice software and
inexpensive Dell servers, neither of which are really suited to the
heavy-lifting of an e-commerce site supporting many thousands of
concurrent users.
</P>
<P>
   Tesco Direct customers already complain of slow-loading pages
and crashes when demand is high.
</P>
<P>
   Even more fundamentally, unless Tesco can use the Web actually
to lower its distribution costs, online victories will tend to be
of the Pyrrhic variety.
</P>
<P>
   One important step will be to link the orders of each Web
shopper with every supplier by connecting Tesco Direct with its new
extranet. But to be a genuine e-commerce leader, Tesco will, before
long, have to build a first-class technology and logistical
infrastructure, including dedicated picking centers.
</P>
<P>
   Those 7,000 new jobs demonstrate that Tesco has not built an
Internet business that can ``scale,'' that is, grow without costs
growing too.
</P>
<P>
   Tesco may make few mistakes, but the timing and execution of
this transition are crucial. As retailers are finding out, the Web
is an unforgiving place. &QL;

IRA PRESSURED TO INDICATE IT WILL DISARM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN AND JOHN O'FARRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ As the Irish Republican Army comes under growing
pressure to send a clear signal that it will disarm, the militant
group and its political allies in Sinn Fein are finding themselves
increasingly isolated.
</P>
<P>
   More moderate Irish nationalists, both in Northern Ireland and
the Irish Republic, have been urging the IRA to save the
two-month-old government of Northern Ireland by beginning to turn
in or destroy weapons _ or at least promise to do so in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many of those moderate nationalists are also miffed that
Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble has brought this latest crisis
in the Irish peace process to a head by threatening to resign and
collapse the fledgling government unless the IRA begins to disarm,
or ``decommission,'' as it called here.
</P>
<P>
   Moderates are sympathetic to Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams'
insistence that the unionists' unilateral demands make it harder
for him and his colleagues to convince the IRA that it is time to
make a gesture on weapons. But they do give Trimble credit for
being willing to compromise and take a seat in a cabinet with two
members of Sinn Fein, and increasing numbers of them want the IRA
to make its intentions known, one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   This week, even the Irish News, a Belfast newspaper most widely
read by Irish nationalists, pleaded with the IRA to make a gesture
to save the power-sharing government, which will be shut down next
week unless the IRA budges. When Protestant unionists agreed to
form the joint cabinet with Catholic nationalists, it set the stage
for London to turn back control of Northern Ireland to local
officials for the first time in 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   Seamus Mallon, the fledgling government's deputy first minister
and a senior Catholic nationalist leader, said it was time for the
IRA to demonstrate its commitment to democracy and respond to the
compromises by Trimble and the Ulster Unionists.
</P>
<P>
   Still, interviews with middle-class Catholics in South Belfast
reveal that while many of them are not happy with the IRA's
intransigence, neither are they convinced that unionists are
willing to share power on a long-term basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``A plague on all their houses, that's my attitude,'' said
Denise, a childcare worker from South Belfast who asked that her
last name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   In nationalist areas that have been vulnerable to attack from
loyalist paramilitary groups in the past, and where the IRA has
always drawn support, there is no pressure on the IRA to disarm. In
fact, most people there want the IRA to retain its arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way, Jose,'' said Claire Murphy, 58, a mother of 11, when
asked Friday if the IRA should disarm. Murphy lives on Bombay
Street, a Catholic enclave burned out by loyalists in 1969, when
the IRA had few arms and could do nothing to deter the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask the Shankill to decommission,'' she added, referring to
the nearby, staunchly loyalist Shankill Road.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many nationalists, not just supporters of Sinn Fein,
complain over what they see as a preoccupation with IRA weapons at
the expense of those held by loyalist paramilitary groups that have
killed some 1,000 people, most of them Catholics, over the last 30
years. Like the IRA, the loyalists refuse to commit to disarming.
</P>
<P>
   While there are a handful of politicians from the political
wings of loyalist paramilitary groups in the Northern Ireland
Assembly, they did not garner enough votes in elections to place
their members in the power-sharing Cabinet. that has administered
Northern Ireland for the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein's transformation from a front for the IRA to a
mainstream political party that attracts nearly 20 percent of the
vote in Northern Ireland has been cheered on by some of the leading
opinion makers in the United States. But even traditionally
sympathetic voices there are saying it's time for the IRA to
demonstrate it is committed to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Editorials this week in The New York Times, Washington Post, and
Boston Globe, papers that have in recent years voiced support for
republicans moving into the mainstream, called on the IRA either to
turn in weapons or make clear that it will. The Post went the
furthest, urging longtime political supporters of Irish
nationalism, including Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, to
call on the IRA to make a gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and President Clinton, two of the most outspoken
supporters of the peace process, have been conspicuously silent. On
Tuesday, Clinton said he thought anything he could say at such a
sensitive time would hurt rather than help. In an interview last
year, Kennedy said he has purposely kept silent during sensitive
times in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   In response to an inquiry from the Globe, Kennedy issued a
statement Friday that said, ``The need is urgent for progress on
decommissioning. The institutions established under the Good Friday
Agreement are working well. It would be a tragedy if they are
suspended or allowed to fail.''
</P>
<P>
   But in meetings last month in Washington, Clinton made it clear
to Adams that he expected disarming to occur at some point,
according to White House officials.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Adams said he has assured everyone who asked,
from Clinton to British Prime Minister Tony Blair to Irish premier
Bertie Ahern, that Sinn Fein believes ``decommissioning is an
essential part of the Good Friday Agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   But Adams insisted that decommissioning has been turned into a
political football by those who actually do not want weapons to be
turned in, so they could walk away from the peace process and blame
Sinn Fein and the IRA. He said ``the important thing is that IRA
guns are silent'' and that decommissioning will only happen if it
is voluntarily, not in response to a unilateral demand by unionists
_ even if that demand has the support of the British and Irish
governments.
</P>
<P>
   When Trimble and his party, which represents most Protestants in
Northern Ireland, agreed to form a government that includes two
cabinet ministers from Sinn Fein, the conditioned it on the
understanding that the IRA begin turning in its arsenal, or at
least commit to doing so, by the end of January.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein leaders say they have abided by the terms of the Good
Friday Agreement of 1998, the compromise that created the
power-sharing government and cross-border agencies that give Dublin
a bigger role in Northern Ireland. The agreement said paramilitary
groups should finish disarming by May but set no date for the
process to begin. It also required parties associated with
paramilitary groups, such as Sinn Fein, only to make their ``best
effort'' to persuade paramilitaries to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said the British decision to suspend the power-sharing
government will probably lead the IRA to break off contact with an
international commission overseeing the disarming of paramilitary
groups. The IRA, which until two months ago insisted it would never
lay down its weapons, appointed one of its senior commanders to
discuss the possibility in return for creation of the power-sharing
government.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Britain introduced legislation that will suspend the
power-sharing government and reimpose direct rule from London next
week unless the IRA relents. The British and Irish governments hope
the pressure on the IRA, especially from usually sympathetic
sources, will force a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Those closest to the IRA, however, fear that pressure will lead
the IRA to dig in its heels.

<P>
   Buzz feels terrible about ratting on Michelle, Vanessa is ill
because someone has secretly poisoned her lip balm, and Josh is
dithering between Reva and Olivia _ another typical week in
Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   Over in Oakdale, meanwhile, Abigail and Chris have awakened
locked in the library, while Phillips has been bribing Chinese-food
delivery men to slip menacing fortune cookies to Carly and Jack.
</P>
<P>
   Tales of thwarted love, vengeful scheming and family anguish
have been at the heart of American television from its earliest
days.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the longest-running soap operas _ ``Guiding Light,'' home
to the unhappy Buzz, and ``As the World Turns,'' the annals of
Oakdale _ are well into their fifth decades on CBS (and ``Guiding
Light'' had run since 1937 on the radio before switching medium in
1953).
</P>
<P>
   Yet this durable form is showing signs of weariness. Audiences
for daytime soap opera have declined by 83 percent since 1991; the
11 shows that now run on the three old national networks each lost
viewers over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The reason that soap and household-goods manufacturers such as
Procter &AMP; Gamble, which owns both ``Guiding Light'' and ``As the
World Turns,'' sponsored ``soap'' operas in the first place was the
size of their female audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Yet among women aged between 18 and 49, the bulk of the viewers
of the interminable sagas, the fraction watching the shows fell by
up to a quarter in the year between the autumn season of 1998 and
autumn 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The worst performing of the bunch, ``Sunset Beach'' on NBC, a
relative youngster launched as recently as 1997, has been cancelled
after failing to hook enough viewers (although it has roared ahead
in other markets such as Britain).
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not that torrid goings-on in the suburbs are
losing their appeal, but that increased work outside the home means
that fewer women are free to watch during the day and, for those
that do still have the time, there are more alternatives vying for
their attention.
</P>
<P>
   Courtroom dramas, such as ``Judge Judy'' and ``Divorce Court,''
in which actual cases are heard by a jurist, bring to the screen
some of the same elements of family vituperation that keep soap
fans in a lather. But they have the added frisson that the
disasters they depict are for real.
</P>
<P>
   They are also cheaper to make than soap operas, requiring only
one set and generally a smaller cast.
</P>
<P>
   As their audiences have grown, these shows have proliferated
across the daytime television schedules _ seven more are in the
works, including such alarming sounding titles as ``Moral Court''
and ``Judge Hatchett,'' both bought by networks at NATPE, the
television industry's big annual trade fair, held in New Orleans in
late January.
</P>
<P>
   Other relatively cheap programs that have thrived at the expense
of the soaps are chat and quiz shows, although the success of ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' on ABC is pulling the newest quiz
programs into the evening ``prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is having a mixed effect on the soaps. While online
browsing for books, beanie babies and mutual funds does eat into
the time available to spend in front of a television screen, the
Internet has acres of chat rooms devoted to favorite soaps.
</P>
<P>
   These stoke their fans' enthusiasm with discussions of whether
characters are behaving true to their family history or whether
things have gone downhill during the decades that the fans have
been following the series. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, the Internet's interactive potential may
increase the appeal of soap operas by allowing fans not merely to
gasp at what the characters have been getting up to, but actively
to meddle in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the hottest new ideas for prime time involve an
online element which, if successful, could be injected into daytime
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The networks, for example, have just been involved in a bidding
war for the right to make an American version of ``Big Brother,'' a
Dutch program which puts a group of young people in a house
festooned with cameras and then lets the audience vote on who gets
to remain on the program as it proceeds from day to day.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of several European programs being adapted for
American television that have been picked up by the networks in the
aftermath of the success of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,''
which started in Britain. &QL;

<P>
   The networks persevere with traditional soap operas because,
despite the erosion of their audience, they remain the best way to
offer advertisers the chance to reach a lot of women viewers with
one commercial. Once they take hold, they generate tenacious
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   And continuity from episode to episode does not depend on one
person, as it does with chat shows, which live and die by their
host, and court programs, each of which relies on a powerful
personality in the judge's chair. Rather they rely on a rich, not
to say overripe, stew of characters.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for the networks is to keep on hooking new viewers
who can take over from the older ones. To this end, they are
introducing younger characters into their programs and even aiming
to entice some of the teenagers who make ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer'' a big hit on evening television.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for example, a witch with a magic doll in one new
show, ``Passions,'' launched on NBC in July last year. Her potions
might spell bad news for Buzz. &QL;

<P>
   Buzz feels terrible about ratting on Michelle, Vanessa is ill
because someone has secretly poisoned her lip balm, and Josh is
dithering between Reva and Olivia _ another typical week in
Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   Over in Oakdale, meanwhile, Abigail and Chris have awakened
locked in the library, while Phillips has been bribing Chinese-food
delivery men to slip menacing fortune cookies to Carly and Jack.
</P>
<P>
   Tales of thwarted love, vengeful scheming and family anguish
have been at the heart of American television from its earliest
days.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the longest-running soap operas _ ``Guiding Light,'' home
to the unhappy Buzz, and ``As the World Turns,'' the annals of
Oakdale _ are well into their fifth decades on CBS (and ``Guiding
Light'' had run since 1937 on the radio before switching medium in
1953).
</P>
<P>
   Yet this durable form is showing signs of weariness. Audiences
for daytime soap opera have declined by 83 percent since 1991; the
11 shows that now run on the three old national networks each lost
viewers over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The reason that soap and household-goods manufacturers such as
Procter &AMP; Gamble, which owns both ``Guiding Light'' and ``As the
World Turns,'' sponsored ``soap'' operas in the first place was the
size of their female audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Yet among women aged between 18 and 49, the bulk of the viewers
of the interminable sagas, the fraction watching the shows fell by
up to a quarter in the year between the autumn season of 1998 and
autumn 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The worst performing of the bunch, ``Sunset Beach'' on NBC, a
relative youngster launched as recently as 1997, has been cancelled
after failing to hook enough viewers (although it has roared ahead
in other markets such as Britain).
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not that torrid goings-on in the suburbs are
losing their appeal, but that increased work outside the home means
that fewer women are free to watch during the day and, for those
that do still have the time, there are more alternatives vying for
their attention.
</P>
<P>
   Courtroom dramas, such as ``Judge Judy'' and ``Divorce Court,''
in which actual cases are heard by a jurist, bring to the screen
some of the same elements of family vituperation that keep soap
fans in a lather. But they have the added frisson that the
disasters they depict are for real.
</P>
<P>
   They are also cheaper to make than soap operas, requiring only
one set and generally a smaller cast.
</P>
<P>
   As their audiences have grown, these shows have proliferated
across the daytime television schedules _ seven more are in the
works, including such alarming sounding titles as ``Moral Court''
and ``Judge Hatchett,'' both bought by networks at NATPE, the
television industry's big annual trade fair, held in New Orleans in
late January.
</P>
<P>
   Other relatively cheap programs that have thrived at the expense
of the soaps are chat and quiz shows, although the success of ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' on ABC is pulling the newest quiz
programs into the evening ``prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is having a mixed effect on the soaps. While online
browsing for books, beanie babies and mutual funds does eat into
the time available to spend in front of a television screen, the
Internet has acres of chat rooms devoted to favorite soaps.
</P>
<P>
   These stoke their fans' enthusiasm with discussions of whether
characters are behaving true to their family history or whether
things have gone downhill during the decades that the fans have
been following the series. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, the Internet's interactive potential may
increase the appeal of soap operas by allowing fans not merely to
gasp at what the characters have been getting up to, but actively
to meddle in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the hottest new ideas for prime time involve an
online element which, if successful, could be injected into daytime
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The networks, for example, have just been involved in a bidding
war for the right to make an American version of ``Big Brother,'' a
Dutch program which puts a group of young people in a house
festooned with cameras and then lets the audience vote on who gets
to remain on the program as it proceeds from day to day.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of several European programs being adapted for
American television that have been picked up by the networks in the
aftermath of the success of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,''
which started in Britain. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 950) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The networks persevere with traditional soap operas because,
despite the erosion of their audience, they remain the best way to
offer advertisers the chance to reach a lot of women viewers with
one commercial. Once they take hold, they generate tenacious
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   And continuity from episode to episode does not depend on one
person, as it does with chat shows, which live and die by their
host, and court programs, each of which relies on a powerful
personality in the judge's chair. Rather they rely on a rich, not
to say overripe, stew of characters.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for the networks is to keep on hooking new viewers
who can take over from the older ones. To this end, they are
introducing younger characters into their programs and even aiming
to entice some of the teenagers who make ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer'' a big hit on evening television.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for example, a witch with a magic doll in one new
show, ``Passions,'' launched on NBC in July last year. Her potions
might spell bad news for Buzz. &QL;

 &HT;    Delta offers PCs to employees
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines on Friday became the second major U.S.
company in two days to make low-cost home computers available to
all employees.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say such offers, likely to be mimicked by other big
companies, provide a valuable personal benefit to workers but could
further blur the line between work and home for some.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Delta's offer includes a complete 500-megahertz
PC-and-printer system, delivered to any employee's home. The system
comes with built-in access to both the Internet and DeltaNet, the
airline's intranet.
</P>
<P>
   The employee cost: $12 a month for 36 months, or a total of
$432. The hardware alone is worth about $1,600 retail, the airline
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as a wonderful opportunity,'' said flight attendant
Kelley Jackson, who doesn't have a home computer. ``I'm certainly
looking forward to getting one. A lot of times I need to swap trips
or do other scheduling things and now I'll be able to do it at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   The move by Delta, which has 30,000 locally based workers and
72,000 worldwide, followed an announcement on Thursday by Ford
Motor Co., which made a similar computer offer to its 350,000
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies portrayed the deal as a win-win proposition in
which workers get a great buy on new computers while the company
gets a more tech-savvy work force that's also better ``wired'' for
work-related communications and activities.
</P>
<P>
   The computers ``will help Delta people become more informed and
effective in both their personal and professional lives,'' said Leo
Mullin, Delta's chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin said that for Delta, which has a widely dispersed work
force, having more employees online will streamline functions such
as flight crew scheduling and benefits administration.
</P>
<P>
   Hadley Reynolds, director of research at Delphi Group, a Boston
consulting firm, said the offers show that companies are now
recognizing the power of e-commerce in all phases of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The larger companies are realizing the Internet and e-commerce
are the medium for doing business, not just sales,'' said Reynolds.
``The initial push was to have a site with a sales window, but in
the past six months the ubiquity of it is starting to come home.''
</P>
<P>
   By doling out below-cost computers with built-in access to the
company intranet, ``a corporation can subsidize the employee's
personal computer purchase but very much for its own benefit,''
Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   That benefit comes in the form of easier communications with
workers, as well as reduced paperwork and manpower for certain
personnel matters that can be carried out via the intranet. That's
in addition to any specific productivity gains through work done at
home, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Emory University business Professor Benn Konsynski believes the
trend is a boon to companies and their employees. But he said it's
up to employers to ensure that cheap computers and intranet hookups
don't become a burden rather than a perk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is one of execution. When this is done well it does
not interfere with the family and in fact is perceived as a benefit
to the family,'' Konsynski said. ``When it's done poorly it's a
business interruption at home.''
</P>
<P>
   At a choreographed announcement before about 500 workers at
Delta headquarters Friday, Mullin emphasized that those who get the
computers can use them any way they want _ for games, entertainment
or personal Internet surfing _ in addition to plugging into
DeltaNet as needed.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin said Delta would have neither the interest nor the means
to monitor how the computers are used. He also said the airline has
no specific cost-cutting or productivity goals in mind through home
Internet and DeltaNet connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will have certain productivity implications but
those are a secondary element to the effectiveness of better
communications and having more of our people familiar with the
technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's chief information officer, Bob DeRodes, said the airline
expects in the near future to expand DeltaNet so workers at home
can access specific computer programs they use at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the company giving you something at low cost that can
benefit you and your family,'' said ramp worker Skip Cashman, who
didn't attend the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   But Cashman wants to know more about any conditions that go with
taking the computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I speculate it could be used to try to get people to do
recurrent training at home on their own time,'' he said. ``If
that's the case, I don't want it.'' He also said human nature will
compel some employees to take more work home.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin said the airline has no intention of creating a
round-the-clock workplace. ``I don't think the trend is toward 24/7
as much as having options as to when to do the work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   PeoplePC, a San Francisco company that arranges discounted group
computer purchases, is coordinating the project for both Ford and
Delta and will provide technical support. Delta has yet to choose
the hardware provider from among Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and
Toshiba.

EXHUMATION OF SLAIN ACTIVIST CLOUDED IN UNCERTAINTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ It took five attempts to hang Ken Saro-Wiwa, the
impetuous Nigerian writer and democratic activist.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria's military dictator, Sani Abacha, was in a hurry to
silence his critic, but the gallows were rusty and kept
malfunctioning. On his fourth descent from the platform, Saro-Wiwa
cried:
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you people doing this to me? What sort of nation is
this?''
</P>
<P>
   More than four years later, the playwright's plaintive cry
echoes in a macabre battle to exhume his body and give him a proper
burial. His family has enlisted the Boston-based group Physicians
for Human Rights to disinter and identify the remains.
</P>
<P>
   Doing so would mark an important turning point in Nigeria, where
a young civilian government is trying to restore tolerance and
stability after decades of brutal military rule.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of spending the week digging, as planned, the
doctors of Physicians for Human Rights found themselves playing a
delicate diplomatic game among groups who have competing interests
in the bones of Saro-Wiwa and the eight activists slain with him.
Not only has the impasse cast uncertainty over the exhumations, it
has deepened distrust and suspicion within the ethnic group
Saro-Wiwa gave his life to defend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Africa. There are all kinds of agendas,'' said Ken
Wiwa, the slain man's eldest son. ``My father's name, body, and
reputation mean something to everyone, and everyone wants to be
seen to be a part of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Saro-Wiwa was a passionate spokesman for the plight of his
people, the Ogoni, a small ethnic group based in Nigeria's oil-rich
southern delta. Oil, a rich prize for the ruling military clique in
the north, brought destruction to the Ogoni homeland and way of
life. Saro-Wiwa urged the United Nations to recognize the Ogoni as
an endangered minority.
</P>
<P>
   His activism made him a prime target for General Abacha,
Nigeria's last and most brutal military dictator. On May 21, 1994,
four prominent Ogoni leaders were slain during a rally of
Saro-Wiwa's Movement for the Salvation of the Ogoni People.
Saro-Wiwa had been barred by police from attending the rally, but
he was nonetheless arrested, along with eight other radical Ogoni
leaders, for the murders. A rushed and farcical trial followed, in
which key government witnesses identified the accused while
admitting that they had not, in fact, witnessed the killings.
</P>
<P>
   The Nov. 10, 1995, execution of the Ogoni Nine brought
international condemnation. Prominent Nigerian writer Wole Soyinka
denounced it as ``the darkest moment in the history of our
existence in the benighted nation called Nigeria.'' The bodies were
placed in secret and unmarked graves.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in June 1998, Abacha died unexpectedly, paving the way a
year later for the rise of Nigeria's second democratically elected
president, Olusegun Obasanjo. Shortly after Obasanjo's inauguration
last May, Ken Wiwa wrote to the new leader requesting his father's
remains. Obasanjo obliged with an executive order calling for the
bodies of the Ogoni Nine to be returned to their families.
</P>
<P>
   For a nation traumatized by decades of military brutality, the
president's action marked an important step toward redressing the
past. Obasanjo has ended arbitrary arrest and political detention,
set up a human rights commission, and put the military under new
leadership. Some former military officials are now on trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The human rights environment is much better now,'' said
Clement Nwankwo, a lawyer based in Lagos. ``It is important that
Ken Saro-Wiwa be exhumed and given a proper burial. The government
must also determine what happened at the original trial and tender
an apology to the families.''
</P>
<P>
   But rather than bring closure to the families of the Ogoni Nine,
Obasanjo's decision sparked a scramble to claim their bones and
political legacy. Saro-Wiwa's will, drawn up a day before the
slaying of the four Ogoni elders that led to his execution,
authorized his son Ken to oversee a modest burial in a simple
grave.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the need for urgency _ Saro-Wiwa's parents, well into
their 90s, wish to see their son's honor restored before they die _
the family launched an inclusive process to determine how to
recover the bodies and when to bury Saro-Wiwa. Village elders were
consulted. Saro-Wiwa's widow met with the eight other families. It
was understood, Ken Wiwa said, that the exhumations would be
private, not political. Saro-Wiwa, his family decided, would be
reburied on April 24.
</P>
<P>
   Death, however, is a complicated matter in African societies.
Unpaid dowries must be settled before burial, extended families
must be consulted, tribal imperatives considered. Wills don't
always carry the last word.
</P>
<P>
   Devastated by the executions, the Ogoni movement splintered. One
faction resettled in Houston, another in Britain. A public row has
developed between the movement's core, still in Nigeria, and the
Wiwa family over how to exhume and rebury the nine activists. Some
Ogoni elders say they need to look out for the interests of the
eight other families, who are poorer and less prominent than
Saro-Wiwa's. Others say the legacy of the slain activists belongs
to the Ogoni people, and have set up a committee to govern how the
bodies are raised and honored.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ogoni Nine, because of their role for the Ogoni people,
were no longer heads of families,'' said Bariara Kpalap, a leader
of one faction. ``They were leaders of the people. We must give
them their honor, we must strengthen the struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Wiwa retorts: ``I don't need . . . permission to bury my
father. The exhumation and burial of our dead relatives is not a
political matter.'' The family wants a quiet, private burial, in
accordance with Saro-Wiwa's will.
</P>
<P>
   Caught amid the conflicting claims is a group of pathologists
hoping their work would bring healing, rather than more tension, to
the families and their communities. But after a few days of
shuttling among the parties this week, Dr. William Haglund of the
International Forensic Program, a branch of the Boston-baed
program, sounded tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would never believe how hard it is to get these people out
of the ground,'' he said. ``We have to arm-wrestle with the
living.''

   RUSSIA-COMMUNAL-APARTMENTS (St. Petersburg, Russia) _ By the
Russian logic of Tanya Konyenko, there is a good reason why she
must leave her apartment, trudge five flights downstairs and walk
to the local banya, all simply to take a bath. Her apartment
doesn't have hot water, but that is not why. Actually, her

18-year-old brother, their 40-year old mother, a 64-year-old woman,
her 65-year-old husband, a 70-year-old babushka, her 72-year-old

CELLUCCI CHALLENGED ON PLEDGE TO CLEAN UP POWER PLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA WEISS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Three weeks after she painted her Charlestown house a
neat beige, Rosemary Kverek ran her finger along the clapboards.
They were covered with soot.
</P>
<P>
   It comes from the Mystic Station power plant in Everett, about a
mile away, she said. And she considers it a sign that, despite his
campaign promises, Governor Paul Cellucci isn't doing enough to
reduce pollution at Massachusetts' aging power plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``My house can stand it,'' Kverek said. ``Our lungs can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Kverek joined about two dozen clean-air activists at the State
House Friday to pressure Cellucci to make good on his pledges. In
1998 _ after activists railed about emissions from the so-called
``Filthy Five'' plants in Somerset, Sandwich, Salem, Everett, and
Holyoke _ hen-acting Cellucci pledged to require the plants to burn
more cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, activists said, emissions from the
electricity-generating plants have grown worse. Instead of fairly
clean natural gas, the plants have increasingly been burning
cheaper, dirtier oil. The resulting emissions can cause widespread
health problems, said Jefferson Dickey, of Greater Boston Physicans
for Social Responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``These plants should have been cleaned up 10 years ago,'' he
said. ``This is unconscionable.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials from some plants said they have already taken
steps to clean their emissions, as has the Cellucci administration.
Last year, Cellucci announced the nation's most stringent rules
regarding nitrogen oxide emissions, said Lisa Franklin, spokeswoman
for PG&AMP;E Generating, which owns the plants in Salem and Somerset.
</P>
<P>
   And administration officials said they plan to do more. Friday
night _ after the news conference to hammer Cellucci had already
been scheduled _ clean-air activists said they got a telephone call
from the governor's Executive Office of Environmental Affairs,
announcing plans to meet with plant owners and negotiate voluntary
emission controls.
</P>
<P>
   The players were comparing schedules Friday, trying to set a
meeting date, said Doug Pizzi, spokesman for Environmental Affairs.
``The administration would prefer to do it voluntarily, as opposed
to with regulations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But activists are skeptical, said Cindy Luppi of the group Clean
Water Action, and doubts the power plants ``will be sort of
magically motivated to proceed voluntarily, following literally
years of resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   If the talks break down, the administration will issue new
regulations, forcing companies to lower emissions, Pizzi said. He
said he didn't want to set a deadline for the move. But
environmental groups said they have set one. If they don't see
results by April 1, the groups said, they'll turn up the pressure
on Cellucci and other state officials.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin _ who said PG&AMP;E is eager to take part in the talks _
said continued demonstrations are not needed or wise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public policy by press conference is not the best way to bring
about positive change,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Luppi said environmentalists feel secure about their
tactics. ``It might not be good corporate policy,'' she said, ``but
it's good democracy.''

<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ By the identifiably Russian logic of
Tanya Konyenko, there is a good reason why she must leave her
apartment, trudge five flights downstairs, cross Nevsky Prospekt,
the city's prosperous main street, and walk to the local bathhouse,
all simply to take a bath.
</P>
<P>
   Her apartment doesn't have hot water, but that is not why.
Actually, her apartment doesn't have a bathtub. But that is not
why, either.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that if her apartment had a bathtub and if the
bathtub had hot water, she would have to share it with two 20-ish
men, a 17-year-old girl and her 18-year-old brother, their
40-year-old mother, a 64-year-old woman, her 65-year-old husband, a
70-year-old babushka, that woman's 72-year-old husband and,
finally, with her own husband, Yura.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a bathtub here, I wouldn't use it,'' she said,
``because other people would be washing their dirty underwear in it
all day. And I wouldn't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the very essence of that most Soviet of Russian
institutions, the communal flat: a place so crammed with people,
and so devoid of privacy, that not having a bathtub can be
considered an advantage. There are societies where sharing a
telephone party line is seen as an invasion of personal space. In
Tanya and Yura's apartment, what people share would make Jerry
Springer blush.
</P>
<P>
   Greta Garbo would have been miserable here. Mrs. Konyenko
manages to be alone a little while each day at the bathhouse, and
insists she is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it here,'' she said, then paused a beat to reflect on
her neighbors. ``Of course, it would be much better if I could
poison some of them, and then I would have more room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here'' is flat 7 at Nevsky Prospekt 106, an ornate five-story
building constructed some 125 years ago to accommodate two floors
of stores and three rental units, one on each of the three upper
floors.
</P>
<P>
   There are still two floors of stores. The three remaining floors
were carved decades ago into veritable warrens of cubicles linked
by corridors of peeling checkerboard linoleum, stuffed to the brim
and beyond with lifetimes of musty, precious possessions.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Once the staircase was an airy wall of glass. Soviet engineers
solved that by hanging a steel tube of an elevator outside the
staircase, shutting out any light. Outside the flat, graffiti
advertise sex and politics; inside, by the front door, a wall
scrawl inexplicably depicts a skating mouse named Roller Rat.
</P>
<P>
   The attic, so thick with a century's dust that the wooden floor
is now a thick gray carpet, has become a crash pad for homeless
alcoholics.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Here the Konyenkos _ film critics, chain smokers, sometime
actors and jazz buffs in St. Petersburg's distinctly offbeat
intelligentsia _ have spent all but 3 of their 22 years of married
life. They and their vast collection of records, tapes, CDs and
religious art peacefully coexist in a space roughly 12 feet wide
and 30 feet long, split into two rooms by a false wall covered with
a red carpet.
</P>
<P>
   This is not their dream home. Like countless St. Petersburgers,
the Konyenkos are mired in the communal milieu by inertia, lack of
choice and outright poverty. For their patch of a barely habitable
building with a two-window view of the Adidas, Carnaby and TJ
Collection shops across Nevsky, they pay 140 rubles a month, about
$4.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had the money, we'd live in the Hermitage,'' Mrs.
Konyenko said drily, referring to the czarist palace a few blocks
away that houses much of Russia's greatest art.
</P>
<P>
   Given that they do not, they make do with 360 square feet in the
center of downtown, close to the clubs and movies they love, and
try to keep the door closed when they are home.
</P>
<P>
   Real-estate-wise, this makes them the Trumps of flat 7. A few
linoleum squares away, past a broken bicycle and a collection of
washing tubs and pots, Galina and Boris Semyonovich Korneyev _
30-year veterans here _ live in a dim room barely 7 feet wide and
14 feet long.
</P>
<P>
   A little history: Russians have been living dormitory-style at
least since Peter the Great began building workers' barracks in the
1600s. But it was only in 1918 that the new Soviet government
ordered thousands of churches, mansions and private apartments
carved up and thrown open to peasants and factory workers,
ostensibly to erase all vestiges of class in the new communist
paradise. They called it ``uplotneniye'' _ literally, compressing
or tightening up _ and with good cause.
</P>
<P>
   For eight decades, that is how countless millions of Russians
have entered the world, lived and died: in makeshift cubicles,
sometimes split into two rooms by a false wall, a cupboard or a
bedspread hung from a rope, a supposed minimum of 65 square feet
per person. Accurate figures are hard to come by, but it is how
perhaps 10 million Russians still live, including a million in St.
Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in the city's kommunalki, as the flats are called,
share bathrooms, hallways and a common kitchen, often with several
stoves and sinks and a table for each family. A single telephone
and, in most cases, a single bathtub serve all tenants. Official
Soviet literature and film extolled kommunalki as the epitome of
socialist equality and brotherhood: happy group homes where loving
families shared all with neighbors and broke bread together in a
spirit of harmony and peace.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are indeed some Kramden-Norton-style friendships erected
on the foundation of communal life, but only some, said Alexander
Pozdnyakov, a local expert on St. Petersburg architecture and
history. For most residents, life in a communal flat was _ and
remains _ one of the lower rings of purgatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a word, trushchoby,'' he said. ``It's sort of a
combination of garbage dump and slum. In Khrushchev's time, they
called the flats khrushchoby.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, for example, the filth that comes from sharing common
areas that are no one's responsibility: for years, families brought
their own handmade seats to the toilets. And there is the mental
anguish of being rubbed raw by neighbors one cannot stand but
cannot escape. The common kitchen can be a place to get even by
spiking food with urine, salt and even dead mice.
</P>
<P>
   Families get sick of each other, too, but have fewer options.
Husbands and wives can divorce, but even now must live in the same
tiny room for years until a neighbor dies, freeing up space, or a
private apartment becomes available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people want to make love at night,'' Pozdnyakov sighed.
``But the babushka is snoring on the other side of the cupboard,
and the young baby is screaming. Big problems.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Olga Berggolts, a well-known St. Petersburg writer, described
the misery eloquently in a 1960 work: ``Sound carried in the house
so ideally that if below, on the third floor, some people were
playing blokhi or reading little poems, then on the fifth floor I
could already hear everything, including the bad rhyming. These
too-close forced relations with each other in incredibly small
nooks was very irritating and exhausting.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tenants have been known to resort to extreme solutions. During
Stalin's rule, every kommunalka was peopled with informers, some of
whom solved petty disputes by reporting fellow tenants to the
secret police. After the fingered tenant vanished, sent to the
firing squad or a labor camp, the informer was allowed to add his
cubicle to his real-estate holdings. Mothers had additional babies
or even adopted children to qualify for extra space.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Mr. Konyenko said, a St. Petersburg man pushed his
82-year-old mother off a kommunalki balcony, then moved his
girlfriend into the freed-up living area. ``It's not black humor.
It's the truth,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Yet were the plight of most kommunalki residents not so hapless,
it might draw smiles. Mrs. Konyenko, a tall, thin, 44-year-old
redhead, first moved into Nevsky 106 when she was 10 _ a brief
stay, she thought, while the Soviet government found a real
apartment for her father, a military man, and his wife. The wait
for an apartment stretched 15 years, and by the time father and
wife left, Tanya and Yura were ready to inherit the cubicle. At
that time, more than 20 people lived in the flat, and the scramble
for living space, and the privacy that comes with it, was
relentless.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Konyenko recalls the time nearly 30 years ago when the man
who inhabited one closet-sized cubicle died. By the time the
government had sent a new tenant to scout out his new home a few
days later, the closet was gone entirely, its wallboard and studs
ripped out and its territory seized by the residents of the cubicle
next door.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the family which inhabited a room near the
Konyenko manse: a couple which quickly bore three daughters, who
eventually married and produced offspring of their own before the
clan finally split up. Toward the end, nine people in three
generations lived in a room roughly 10 by 18 feet.
</P>
<P>
   When the eldest of these three daughters got married, the
Konyenkos gave the newlyweds a gift: the right to spend their
wedding night in barely secluded splendor in the second room of
their apartment, on a twin bed hard against the rug-covered
divider.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, yes. But the humor is bittersweet. The Konyenkos, an
eclectic couple, have turned a half-habitable lemon into stylish
lemonade with a plethora of posters and two decades of
collectibles. Their money goes not into property, but travel,
nightclubs and movies.
</P>
<P>
   Few kommunalki residents are so carefree.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There is talk that the city will soon evict the denizens of
Nevsky 106, scattering them to private apartments in the suburbs,
as part of larger plan to eliminate the kommunalki by 2003 _ a goal
that now seems increasingly out of reach, given the state of the
economy. There are plans for a $300 million trade center in the
block, a sparkling collection of renovated offices, luxury
apartments, glass-roofed shopping malls and hanging gardens.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mrs. Konyenko has mixed feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you'd give me some flat in the suburbs, I wouldn't have
it,'' she said. ``Here I'm close to everything. Yura's office is
next door, across the street. There are cinemas. I feel myself in
the center of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   A few feet down the corridor, Galina Korneyev, the 64-year-old
who has spent almost half her life in flat 7, literally grabs her
head, stunned by Mrs. Konyenko's resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can they do it faster?'' she asks, referring to the city's
grand plans. ``How can they do it sooner, so we can move sooner?''

<P>
   HOENGSONG-GUN, South Korea _ Ever since Japan colonized the
Korean peninsula during the first half of the 20th century, Koreans
have harbored an underlying resentment toward the Japanese. But the
latest incarnation of that resentment is not an uproar over newly
disclosed wartime atrocities by Japan's military or a fresh
instance of discrimination against ethnic Koreans living in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   It is, instead, a growing anger over what some Koreans view as
Japan's attempt to co-opt their national dish: a garlicky, peppery,
overwhelmingly pungent pickled cabbage.
</P>
<P>
   Kimchi, as the cabbage is known, has been a staple of the Korean
diet for centuries, and in recent years has become an increasingly
popular and lucrative export _ particularly to the Japanese market.
But now, the Korean kimchi industry is seething because Japanese
foodmakers are increasingly marketing their own copycat kimchi
(pronounced KIM-chee) _ and worse, calling it kimchi.
</P>
<P>
   The Koreans have even brought their complaint to international
food regulators, accusing the Japanese of subverting the value of
authentic kimchi. A favorable ruling for the Koreans could force
Japanese makers of kimchi to call it something else.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has countered that Korea has no monopoly on the term
kimchi, any more than Mexico can lay exclusive claim to tacos or
India to curry. But that argument does not fly with the Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Japanese are selling is nothing more than cabbage
sprinkled with seasonings and artificial flavorings,'' said Robert
Kim, assistant manager for the overseas sales team here at Doosan
Corp., a South Korean food manufacturer that operates the world's
largest kimchi factory. ``This debate is not just about protecting
our market share. We are trying to preserve our national
heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimchi is eaten at almost every meal in South Korea. Like a
strong briny pickle, kimchi is an assault on the taste senses of
the uninitiated eater, and is meant to accompany blander foods. It
is traditionally prepared with Chinese cabbage, red pepper, garlic,
salted fish, ginger and other natural ingredients, then stored
underground in clay containers to ferment for at least four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Once shunned abroad because of its pungent smell, kimchi has
gained a devoted following among some non-Koreans. The Japanese are
especially drawn by kimchi's distinct spicy taste and health
benefits. Kimchi is a low-fat source of vitamins and minerals.
Koreans believe that the microorganisms formed when the salted fish
ferments with kimchi's other ingredients fight cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Winter historically is the prime season in Korea for making
kimchi. Nowhere is that more obvious than in this rural township 45
miles north of Seoul, where the Doosan kimchi factory produces 15
tons a day. Doosan has twice expanded its production lines to meet
the growing demand, particularly from overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never seen anything like this before,'' said Jae Woo
Lee, the production manager of the factory, which reeks like a
giant clove of garlic. ``Orders for kimchi just keep pouring in
from all over. This acceptance of our national food makes us very
proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Exports of kimchi increased 63 percent last year, to an
estimated $85 million in 1998, according to the Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry. About 90 percent of South Korea's kimchi
exports went to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   That, it seems, is what worries South Korean kimchi makers. In a
reversal of the traditional pattern in which Korean manufacturers
often copied popular Japanese products at lower cost, competitors
in Japan, using cheaper and less time-consuming production methods,
are homing in on South Korea's biggest kimchi export market.
</P>
<P>
   Many Japanese producers skip the fermentation and add artificial
sour flavoring using citric acid and gum. The Japanese sometimes
use rice paste to give their kimchi a gluey consistency similar to
that found naturally in the Korean version.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Japanese kimchi say that it lacks the depth of
flavor and health benefits of its Korean counterpart and that
Japanese cabbage contains more water and is not as crispy.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean government has petitioned the World Health
Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization's Codex
Alimentarius commission to establish an international standard that
would require products using the name kimchi to be fermented
according to the Korean tradition.
</P>
<P>
   In negotiations with representatives from South Korea and Japan,
the Codex commission is drafting a kimchi standard that is
scheduled to be ratified next year by the 150 member countries of
the organization, which sets codes for food processing to ensure
minimal health standards.
</P>
<P>
   So far, neither the Japanese nor the Koreans seem satisfied with
Codex's draft standard. It defines kimchi as a ``fermented''
product but permits the use of citric, acetic and lactic acids,
none of which are used in the traditional kimchi process.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is expected to intensify as Codex moves closer to
ratification. Codex member countries are obliged to revise their
domestic regulations to comply with the commission's standards.
</P>
<P>
   If Codex adopts a standard that requires kimchi products to
undergo fermentation, many current Japanese food products sold as
kimchi could be required to use a different name, providing a big
market opportunity for Korean exporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Products that do not fit this standard of fermentation should
not be sold under the name kimchi,'' said Lee Seung Wul, director
of product development for the Agriculture and Fisheries Marketing
Corp., a South Korean government-owned company. ``In pushing for
this international standard, we are trying to let people know that
authentic kimchi is a product that has Korean origins.''
</P>
<P>
   But Japanese kimchi makers contend that once ethnic dishes gain
international popularity, they are almost always altered to fit the
local palate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should the same standard be applied to curry?'' said Toshio
Ogawa, an adviser to the Japan Pickle Producers Association, which
represents several Japanese kimchi makers. ``Everyone knows that
curry was invented in India, but the curry that Indians eat is
quite different from the curry that Japanese eat.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What is really behind South Korea's campaign to strictly define
kimchi, Japanese manufacturers said, is an effort to gain a larger
share of the rapidly expanding Japanese kimchi market. Between 1996
and 1998 annual kimchi production in Japan doubled to about 200,000
tons, according to the Ministry of Agriculture. During the same
period, kimchi imports from Korea to Japan increased to 15,000 tons
from 10,000 tons, but they still only account for about 10 percent
of the total Japanese market.
</P>
<P>
   Korean producers can sell their kimchi at a considerable markup
in Japan. For example, a 500-gram package of kimchi sells for about
$2.60 in South Korea while in Japan a 400-gram package sells for
about $5.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean kimchi argument has found some support in Japan.
Mitsuo Ikeda, managing director of Lotte Bussan Co., a Japan-based
food distributor that has been importing Korean kimchi, said it
makes sense to adhere to the strict Korean standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``A broader definition of what constitutes kimchi will diminish
the merit of the kimchi that we are importing,'' Ikeda said.
Lotte's snack packages of Korean kimchi, which are sold at 7-Eleven
stores in Japan, have proved very popular.
</P>
<P>
   Eiji Fukuda, an official of Japan's Ministry of Agriculture,
said he believed there was ample room for both domestic and
imported kimchi in the Japanese market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genuine Korean kimchi is spicy and has a flavor of garlic,''
Fukuda said. ``It's delicious, but for the Japanese it is difficult
to eat it every morning, and I understand some Japanese might feel
they better not eat it before going to meet people.''
</P>
<P>
   Fukuda also acknowledged, however, that ``Korean people might
not be pleased if Japan learns Korean kimchi techniques and makes
better products or products that look the same but are not
genuine.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if South Korea's effort to restrict Japan's use of the
word kimchi reflected lingering animosity over Japan's colonial
rule of Korea, Fukuda said, ``Though I do not belong to the
generation that ruled Korea, there could be some remaining
sentiments.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the wrangling, some Koreans view Japan's growing
penchant for kimchi as a sign of progress toward closer ties
between the two cultures, whether the recipe is Japanese or Korean.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a boy growing up in Japan, the only place we
Koreans could eat kimchi was within my family's house because the
Japanese looked down on Koreans, saying that we smelled like garlic
and red pepper,'' said Chong Dae Sung, an ethnic Korean professor
of comparative food culture at Shiga Prefectural University in
Japan. ``Today, the situation is totally changed.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: IRA'S REFUSAL TO START DISARMING GOES DEEP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Irish Republican Army, now in the third year of a
cease-fire, is trying to convince people of its peaceful intent by
not using its guns. But it has cast doubt on that objective by
insisting on keeping them.
</P>
<P>
   The power-sharing Northern Ireland government, only 2 months
old, faces being suspended next week because the guerrilla group
refuses to start disarming. The British and Irish governments
announced on Thursday that the IRA must start scrapping its arsenal
now.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA shows no signs of yielding, and Gerry Adams, the Sinn
Fein president, said Friday that he did not expect it to do so in
time to avert a shutdown of the Belfast government. ``No undefeated
army ever acted on the back of a series of demands to do certain
things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In those words lay a telling reference to the thinking of the
IRA, which could starting disarming immediately and still have an
enormous arsenal left. The force also has bomb-making equipment to
enable it to speedily replace whatever arms it sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people ask why can't they just give in a gun or a bullet
or a wheelbarrow of weapons or whatever, that's the wrong
question,'' said Dominic Murray, the director of the Center of
Peace and Development Studies at the University of Limerick in the
Irish Republic. ``It's an understandable question, particularly
from outsiders, but it misses the point.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not whether you decommission a ton or a ha'penny's
worth,'' he said. ``It's not the amount. It's the principle.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRA equates disarmament with surrender. The group stresses,
as Adams' words point up, that it is not an army that lost a war.
It is taking part in the peace settlement out of choice, not force,
and disarming must be voluntary, it insists.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `Why don't they hand over a small amount, make a
gesture,''' said Brian Feeney, author of ``Lost Lives,'' a book
detailing the lives and deaths of 3,637 people who have died in
sectarian violence since 1966. ``The gesture as they see it would
be symbolic of their being the bad guys, their struggle the one
that was illicit and wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Add to this sense elements of tradition, suspicion, fear and
national myth-making, and no amount of logic can overcome it.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, the largely Catholic movement that wants closer
links to Ireland, generally recognize that the arrangements that
the IRA is now defying have brought them significant benefits.
Their politicians sit in the power-sharing Legislature and command
primary ministries; a human rights panel has been set up; hundreds
of prisoners have been freed; the British troop presence has been
reduced. And the Royal Ulster Constabulary, which many Catholics
believe embodied harsh Protestant domination of their people, is
being demilitarized, down-sized and made more representative of the
province's population mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing about the IRA's decision that is strategic,''
Feeney said. ``It's atavistic and sentimental.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Arthur, a professor of politics at the University of
Ulster, put it this way: ``Never underestimate the impact of folk
memory on the psychology of republicanism.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray, from the University of Limerick, said, ``There are still
people in the republican movement who maintain the psyche of the
1920s.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to arms, the IRA has no qualms about dashing the
incipient political careers of the Sinn Fein leaders who appeared
to be relishing their new roles as government ministers. In a
warning last week, Adams betrayed his own inability to sway the
IRA, saying: ``It is not easy to get the IRA to do this speedily.
This is the reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland remains the most heavily armed area in Europe,
with police officers operating out of bunkers, riding the streets
of the province in armored personnel carriers and setting out on
sidewalk patrols in bulletproof vests.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of guns has continually arisen, and in peace talks
politicians have shied away from demanding ironclad commitments. At
the beginning of the current talks, they came up with a
neutral-sounding word _ decommissioning _ to try to get around the
onus of surrender attached to the word disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   In the language of the 1998 peace accord, all that Sinn Fein and
other parties with links to paramilitary groups were committing
themselves to was to use ``any influence they may have to achieve
the decommissioning of all paramilitary arms within two years.''
That period extends to May 22. The clandestine nature of the IRA
makes it difficult to estimate the amount of its weaponry with
accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's domestic news agency, The Press Association, has
reported that the arsenal includes thousands of handguns and
rifles, Russian heavy-caliber armor-piercing machine guns, AK-47
semiautomatic rifles, flame throwers, rocket-propelled grenades,
mortars and grenade launchers, surface-to-air missiles and from one
to four tons of Semtex explosive.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk is said to have come in shipments from Libya in the
early 1980s. The Libyan leader, Moammar Gadhafi, said publicly that
he wanted to arm the IRA in retaliation for the decision by
Margaret Thatcher, then the British prime minister, to assist
American bombing raids on his country.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish police also say that illicit shipments from the United
States have included handguns, submachine guns, pistols and
ammunition for sniper rifles.
</P>
<P>
   IRA arms are hidden on both sides of the border in holes and
caves in farm country. The police are sometimes alerted to caches
by hikers and picnickers.
</P>
<P>
   Various methods of taking the IRA weapons out of circulation
have been suggested. They include allowing the IRA to destroy its
own weapons, with verification coming from a monitoring panel, and
what is called a ``rust solution,'' _ alerting the authorities to
the location of munitions and sealing them off to prevent use.
</P>
<P>
   Weapons are seldom out of sight in Northern Ireland. The walls
of housing projects are scarred by murals showing ski-masked
terrorists brandishing machine guns. These days the ones in
Catholic neighborhoods are displaying chilling slogans that read,
``Not one bullet.''

 &HT;    Judge rules Coca-Cola must clarify role of laid-off employees in
suit
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A federal judge has ordered Coca-Cola Co. to clarify
to employees losing their jobs that they can participate in a
racial discrimination lawsuit against the company as ``witnesses or
sources of evidence'' and still get enhanced severance benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But Coca-Cola can withhold those extra benefits from employees
who don't sign a release form agreeing to give up their right to
sue the company or their right to become a member of a possible
class action, U.S. District Judge Richard Story ruled Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' attorneys unsuccessfully tried to get the judge
to rule that the release forms would not be valid until a decision
is made about class certification. That decision is not expected
for at least several months.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, Coca-Cola filed a formal response to once again
deny the allegations in the suit, which the plaintiffs revised in
late December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coca-Cola's actions with respect to the named plaintiffs have
been in all respects for legitimate, non-discriminatory business
reasons and, as such, are not unlawful,'' the company said in its
106-page answer to the revised suit.
</P>
<P>
   Eight current and former employees have sued the company,
alleging that it has discriminated against African-American
employees in pay, promotions and performance evaluations. They are
seeking class-action status so they can represent more than 2,000
black salaried employees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The suit became intertwined with the massive job cuts Coca-Cola
announced last week. The company developed a release form requiring
laid-off workers to sign a waiver promising they will not make any
legal claims against Coca-Cola if they want to receive the enhanced
severance package. The release form specifically mentions the
discrimination case and required employees who want the benefits
not to participate in the case in any way.
</P>
<P>
   But, after a challenge by the plaintiffs' attorneys, Story ruled
that the company will have to issue a memo making it clear that the
laid-off employees who sign the release form can still supply
information to the plaintiffs' side.
</P>
<P>
   If they do sign the release, Story said, then they can't
participate in the case as a plaintiff or as a prospective class
member if the case gets class-action status.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, if the plaintiffs prevail in the civil action,
you would not be entitled to receive any money or other relief
obtained in the case,'' Story said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the judge is requiring the company to tell employees it
can't retaliate against it if they don't sign the release form.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agree with the judge's ruling,'' said Coca-Cola spokesman
Ben Deutsch. ``It's important that all affected employees are aware
of their rights, and this will provide further clarification.''
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorneys also said they agreed with the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pleased that the court has accepted our request to
modify the terms and scope of the release form,'' said Lamar Mixon,
co-lead counsel for the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   He would not comment, however, on the company's formal answer to
the suit.
</P>
<P>
   In its detailed response, the company said none of the
plaintiffs' allegations are appropriate for class-action treatment.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Coca-Cola attacked several of the plaintiff's key
allegations, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ The company denied that a U.S. Labor Department audit
documented significant race-based disparities in compensation and
career advancement.
</P>
<P>
   _ The company denied that a 1995 internal report by Carl Ware,
Coke's highest ranking black executive, concluded that it
discriminates against African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   _ The company denied that it in any way engaged in
discriminatory treatment against the eight plaintiffs in the case.
Coca-Cola said three plaintiffs misrepresented their employment
histories.

But the latest incarnation of that resentment is not an uproar over

It is, instead, a growing anger over what some Koreans view as

NEW ARMS INSPECTOR SAYS UNITED NATIONS WILL SETTLE   DISPUTES ABOUT
ACCESS 
</HEADLINE>
    (rk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United Nations' new chief arms inspector
for Iraq, Hans Blix, said Friday that his inspection teams would
not force their way into suspected weapons sites in Iraq but would
defer to U.N. headquarters to resolve any confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   Blix, who is preparing to assume his new job on March 1, appears
to have decided to bring the inspection system into much closer
alliance with the U.N. bureaucracy, following the pattern of the
International Atomic Energy Agency, an arm of the United Nations,
which he ran from 1981 until 1997.
</P>
<P>
   His predecessors at the U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM, the
first Iraqi disarmament commission, which is now being phased out,
had kept their operations largely independent, reporting only to
the nations on the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some shift in emphasis here toward a more U.N.
operation,'' Blix said Friday at a news conference in Stockholm.
But he also said that he would not permit staff members to take
instructions from any government _ a pledge than can cut two ways,
not always to Iraq's liking. Previous arms inspection teams have
been accused of aiding U.S. intelligence-gathering efforts in Iraq.
On the other hand, Russia has also applied pressure on the
inspection commission to make decisions in Iraq's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Blix, an international lawyer and former Swedish foreign
minister, said he expects his new panel _ the U.N. Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission _ to face Iraqi roadblocks.
The commission is responsible for eliminating Iraq's biological,
chemical and prohibited missile programs. It works with the atomic
energy agency on nuclear issues.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq cannot hope to have sanctions suspended or lifted until
inspectors and the Security Council determine that the government
of President Saddam Hussein is complying with the commission. Iraq
has indicated that it will probably not be cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inspectors cannot shoot their way to any sites,'' Blix
said, according to an Associated Press report from Stockholm. ``If
they are not admitted, the response will have to come through the
United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors from the first arms panel say that allowing the
Iraqis to negotiate access to sites through diplomatic or
bureaucratic channels _ a concession made by the first chief
inspector, Rolf Ekeus, in 1996, and built on by Secretary-General
Kofi Annan in Baghdad in 1998 _ gives Iraq too much power to stymie
investigations or limit them to sham inspections.

SIMPSON CHALLENGES GORE ON GULF WAR VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is one of the more serious charges anyone could
level against a potential commander in chief: that Al Gore voted to
send America's sons and daughters to war based on selfish political
motives.
</P>
<P>
   But that is just the allegation that Alan Simpson, former
Republican senator from Wyoming and current director of the
Institute of Politics at Harvard, is willing to make.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Gore's victory in the New Hampshire primary
Tuesday, Simpson, long a Gore critic, revived a charge that he and
then-Senator Bob Dole first made during the 1992 presidential
campaign. They said Gore's decision to vote for US intervention in
the Persian Gulf War was based, at least in part, on which side
would give him the better prime time speaking opportunity during
the televised Senate debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are talking about who people are, and about their
character,'' Simpson said in an interview, ``I never saw such a
thing happen with anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore supporters are outraged that Simpson has unearthed what
they dismiss as a canard. ``It is wrong. It is irresponsible. The
people who say it are nuts,'' said Marla Romash, an adviser to Gore
who was on his Senate staff at the time of the Gulf War vote.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's two biographers, both of whom have dug up material that
is critical of the vice president on other matters, said Simpson's
charges are not supported by the facts. Indeed, both conclude that
Gore's vote should be viewed as an act of moral and political
courage.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson raised the issue Tuesday during an appearance on the
CNBC talk show ``Hardball,'' where he was joined by John Sununu,
the former White House chief of staff. The Bradley campaign, on
Friday, was reportedly circulating transcripts of the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson and Sununu both alleged that Gore ``shopped'' his vote,
to see which side would give him the longer prime slot in which to
speak when the Senate debate neared its climax on Jan. 12, 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Gore denied the allegation when the Republicans leveled it in
1992 and again, through a spokesman, this week.
</P>
<P>
   By Gore's telling, he inquired of both sides about the schedule
for debate while he was still undecided and struggling with his
conscience over the vote. He alerted the opposing leaders as a
matter of logistics and senatorial courtesy, not political
calculation, the Gore campaign said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was with him at midnight when he walked out the door of the
office, after a long conversation, and he still had not made up his
mind,'' Romash said. ``It was routine in the Senate at that time to
notify the leader of which side you were going to speak to request
time. He notified Dole and Mitchell, knowing he might come down on
either side.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode began on Friday, Jan. 11, Simpson said in an
interview, as he and Dole were sitting in the Senate cloakroom.
</P>
<P>
   Dole was then the Republican leader, and Simpson the Republican
whip. The vote was tight, with most Republicans in favor of a
resolution giving President Bush congressional approval to go to
war with Iraq to free Kuwait from Iraqi occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Most Senate Democrats, however, had lined up behind the majority
leader, George Mitchell of Maine, and behind the chairman of the
Armed Services Committee, Sam Nunn of Georgia, who introduced a
competing resolution that favored the continued use of economic
sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dole and Simpson, Gore approached the two GOP
leaders and asked, ``How much time will you give me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``How much time did you get from the other side?'' Dole asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven minutes,'' Gore replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll give you 15 minutes,'' Dole said, and Simpson then
offered Gore an additional five minutes of his time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me think about it,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   From that brief conversation, recounted this week by Simpson, he
and Dole drew the conclusion that Gore was looking to trade his
vote for a prime speaking opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was shopping. He was seeing where he could get the most
prime time on television, if he voted for or against,'' Dole said
on CNN in 1992. ``It was quite an inside joke around the Senate,
the way he played it.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson said that Gore later phoned Howard Greene, a Republican
Senate aide, to nail down the promised 20-minute speaking slot, and
threatened to vote with Nunn and Mitchell if the GOP reneged.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell was angry, Simpson said, when Dole asked for extra time
to accommodate Gore's request. Simpson began referring to Gore as
``Prime-time Al.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore eventually spoke for 20 minutes during the final day of
debate, and voted with the Republicans, who prevailed by a 52-47
margin. Nine other Democrats joined him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Dole called and let us know very triumphantly that he
thought that by giving a little extra time to Senator Gore, he was
going to get his vote,'' Sununu said on ``Hardball.'' ``We were
very happy to get it for as little as . . . 20 minutes of air
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of Simpson's former aides said this week that they did not
witness the conversation between Gore and the GOP leaders, but
remember Dole and Simpson talking about it soon thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic floor aide at the time, however, said Simpson's
charges were ludicrous. Not only was there no Senate flap about
Gore's vote, the aide said, but ``it is transparently obvious that
Senator Mitchell would have given Senator Gore any time he wanted.
It was a close vote. If Senator Gore had asked for 20 minutes he
would have gotten them.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene was unavailable for comment. Nunn, Mitchell, and
Mitchell's former aides also declined opportunities to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's two biographers, however, side with the vice president.
Former ABC reporter Bob Zelnick, now a professor of journalism at
Boston University, said that he looked into the episode when
researching his biography of Gore, which is otherwise critical of
the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Zelnick's sources in the Senate, whom he would not reveal, shot
down the ``shopping'' story and told him that Gore acted out of
principle, not expediency, in the Persian Gulf debate. With just a
few hours to go, Zelnick said, Gore was still consulting with
Martin Peretz, a friend who publishes The New Republic magazine,
and then-Representative Steve Solarz of New York, about the wisdom
of war in the gulf.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Zelnick writes in his book that Gore's vote
``deserves to be recognized as an act of conscience and moral
courage.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bill Turque, a Newsweek reporter whose forthcoming book on
Gore contains embarrassing material about the candidate's use of
marijuana, said he thought Simpson and Sununu were engaged in ``a
bunch of election season spin.'' Turque said he ``found nothing''
to substantiate Simpson's allegation and agreed with Zelnick that
Gore's vote on the Gulf War was ``probably the most courageous vote
he ever cast.''

 &HT;        Klink Low On Dough   BY Laura Winter   c. 2000 States News
<TEXT>
Service &QL;  &QC;  WASHINGTON (Feb. 4) - Now we know why Rep. Ron Klink was
so shy about his campaign cash: He hasn't got much of the green
compared to his rivals.
<P>
   Klink, the Democratic U.S. representative from Pittsburgh, might
be considered a frontrunner in this year's senate race, but
campaign finance records obtained from the Secretary of the Senate
say he has less money in the bank than all but two of the
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Elections Commission deadline for filing 1999
campaign contribution and spending activities reports was Monday.
Klink refused to release the records directly to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Before Klink gets to tangle with the man he hopes to unseat,
U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum R-Pa., he's got to defeat five fellow
Democrats for the privilege in the April 4 primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Ron Klink's message of improving the quality of our
public schools and expanding our access to health care will carry
the day,'' said Klink campaign spokesman J.J. Balaban. ``We will
have enough money to communicate Ron Klink's message.'' The
Pittsburgh congressman's campaign coffers hold $445,501 compared to
the $793,229 logged in by Philadelphia state Sen. Allyson Schwartz
and the $532,533 state Labor Secretary Tom Foley recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery county attorney Bob Rovner beat all Democrats for
cash supply with his $1.6 million, $1.5 million of which he
supplied himself.
</P>
<P>
   Klink, however, did raise $866,079, more money for 1999 than any
other Democratic candidate was able to raise, excluding self-loans.
</P>
<P>
   While five of the senate candidates faxed off to the press
copies of their reports, only Klink and Phil Berg were missing.
Berg, in a statement, said he had joined the race too late to file.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Klink's report was delayed, Balaban said the campaign
was following ``standard procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We sent the reports to the Secretary of the Senate following
standard procedure,'' Balaban ``And then they were made available
to reporters and the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever does eventually square off with Santorum for the
six-year senate term will have to faced down his spending power of
$3.3 million come November.

 &HT;    Mohawk to buy plastic bottles from Coke bottler, turn them into
carpet
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mohawk Industries has inked a large deal with
Coca-Cola Enterprises to buy its recycled plastic bottles in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun, Ga.-based Mohawk, one of the world's largest recyclers
of plastic, will turn the bottles into polyester carpet at its
plant in Summerville, Ga. Mohawk said it jumped on an exclusive
contract with CCE, the largest Coca-Cola bottler, to help offset
the effect of a recently expanded recycling law in California.
</P>
<P>
   California, one of 10 states with bottle deposit laws, broadened
its law Jan. 1 to include most plastic containers. Previously,
California's ``bottle bill'' primarily covered carbonated soft
drink bottles made with polyethylene terephthalate, or PET.
</P>
<P>
   Many U.S. plastics recyclers get their bottles from California,
which collected about 100 million pounds of PET last year. Now,
some recyclers are concerned that plastics that aren't properly
sorted will contaminate loads of PET and raise processing costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got this contract as insurance that we'd have a clean
stream of bottles,'' said Phil Cavin, Mohawk's national director of
procurement. He didn't disclose financial terms of the one-year
Northeastern contract, which effectively equals the amount of
recycled bottles Mohawk previously bought from California. He added
that Mohawk buys bottles from all over the United States and
Canada, mainly from state organizations or waste management
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of California's recycling program said it's too
early to know whether contamination will be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The California supply issue is indicative of a larger recycling
concern. The market for postconsumer PET is growing in some
sectors, but the supply of recycled bottles is not. About 24
percent of the plastic bottles sold in 1998 were recycled, and that
rate has stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, PET is in great demand by Georgia's fiber producers
that turn it into carpet yarn, for example. Mohawk runs the largest
such operation, recycling 200 million pounds of PET a year.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton, Ga.-based Beaulieu of America, the third largest carpet
maker, has greatly expanded its PET recycling capacity at its
Marglen division.

WITHOUT INDEPENDENTS, BRADLEY PRIMARY OUTLOOK GRIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO - Everything looked gray and foreboding over Bill
Bradley's shoulder: the rain, the churning bay, the scavenging
seagulls, and the forces that stand between him and victory in
California.
</P>
<P>
   With his back to a vast picture window overlooking San Francisco
Bay, Bradley launched his campaign in the Golden State Thursday
without the advantage of a law like New Hampshire's that allows
independent voters to choose Democratic ballots on election day in
the crucial race for nominating delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario is the same in several other states, including New
York, holding primaries March 7 _ the 15-state national scramble
which is the ``Super Tuesday'' of this compressed political season.
It is, all in all, a formidable challenge for Bradley's
independent-driven campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With Vice President Al Gore commanding an even stronger hold on
the Democratic establishment and labor unions in many upcoming
primary states than he did in New Hampshire, Bradley is searching
for ways to win without independents in his quest to survive the
March 7 primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be as simple for Bradley as it was in New
Hampshire,'' said Bill Carrick, a Democratic strategist in
California not allied with Gore or Bradley. ``He is going to have
to have a much broader appeal than he has ever had before.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire results illustrate the severity of Bradley's
dilemma. While Gore clobbered him among registered Democrats, 60
percent to 40 percent, Bradley relied on independents to keep the
contest competitive. Independents backed Bradley over Gore, 55-43,
cutting the margin of the vice president's victory to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lagging far behind Gore in national polls, Bradley can ill
afford poor showings in California or New York on March 7, when
nearly 60 percent of the nominating delegates will be allocated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that's a challenge,'' said Chris Stone, a
Bradley organizer and Berkeley law student, of the restrictive
ballot laws. ``We need to work on bringing over union people and
the traditional Democratic constituencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley made a last-ditch appeal Thursday for California
independents to register as Democrats before the deadline on
Monday, a month before the election. Beyond that, he tried to
better target his core message at rank-and-file Democrats. And he
made clear that he will continue to portray Gore as irreparably
tainted by scandal and an integrity deficit, and as ultimately
unelectable in November.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also indicated he may escalate his increasingly bitter
campaign against Gore by attacking the vice president over
President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky. Asked about the
Lewinsky scandal during a series of interviews with California
television stations, Bradley said, ``All I know is, people come up
to me and say we need a fresh start.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the content, the tone of Bradley's attacks on Gore
is likely to sharpen. The days of town meetings are over. No more
intimate exchanges like the one that began his campaign in ``a
livingroom in Jaffrey,'' N.H.
</P>
<P>
   The ``national primary'' will be fought over the airwaves, with
a multimillion-doller ad strategy and campaign events staged for
the maximum media exposure. And the Secret Service is scheduled to
begin protecting Bradley on Monday, further walling him off from
the New Hampshire-like experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do town meetings in all these states,'' Bradley said
in California. ``You have to reach people through the media. I
believe people will see that as more aggressive. But you have to
boldly strike the differences. You'll certainly see more of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's most recent attack fizzled when Senator Bob Kerrey, a
Nebraska Democrat who is one of Bradley's top supporters, asked the
former New Jersey senator to stop calling on Gore to apologize for
insults that Gore supporters heaped on Kerrey during an incident
last week in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's spokesman, Eric Hauser, said Bradley does not plan
to miss an opportunity to criticize Gore on issues of ``candor,
conviction and responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Bradley hopes to chip into Gore's support among
women in California, who are expected to comprise about 55 percent
of the total Democratic voters, by highlighting Gore's opposition
in the 1980s to federally funded abortions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bradley loyalists said, they intend to amplify
their argument that Democrats should support Bradley because his
strength among independents will make him a stronger candidate in
the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to continue to send a big signal that he's going
to have that kind of support in November,'' said Representative
George Miller, one of Bradley's top allies in California.
``Everybody wants to know where the independents are going to go,
and New Hampshire was a pretty good indication.''
</P>
<P>
   However, polls show solid support for Gore across a broad
demographic in California, from Latinos, who will make up about 15
percent of the Democratic oote, to union members.
</P>
<P>
   Under a new law in California, members of any party can vote for
any candidate on election day, and the results will be tallied
without regard to party. But both major parties will allocate
nominating delegates based solely on the vote totals from their
party members.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Bradley could win the popular vote but lose to Gore
in the more important race for Democratic delegates. ``The next
morning, Bradley could say, 'Look, this is about getting crossover
votes so we can win in the fall, and the fact that I won here
demonstrates I'm the better nominee,'' Carrick said. ``But what
good would that be if the other guy has the majority of
delegates?''
</P>
<P>
   As Bradley heads toward the Super Tuesday crossroad of his
candidacy, he has demonstrated more frequent flashes of fiery
rhetoric but has generally maintained his reserved manner.
</P>
<P>
   At times, though, his frustration has surfaced, as it did long
after midnight Thursday morning on a cross-country flight to
California. The heating system had malfunctioned, and reporters in
the rear of the plane were bundled in coats and blankets. As
Bradley passed glumly through the cabin, he joined in the
occupants' exasperation, uncharacteristicaly uttering a curse to
emphasize hat there also would be not hot meal because there was no
oven on board.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Bradley vented some angst in an impromptu assault
on a punching bag in a television news director's office. The bag,
he said as he wailed away, ``embodies everything I dislike.''

<P>
   Wayne Goehring ran a successful cabinet refinishing business
until about two years ago, when he began noticing strange
sensations in his feet and hands. Multiple sclerosis was soon
diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   Now he struggles both physically and financially. He has had to
disband the Kitchen Tune-Up franchise he opened in 1989 in
Bismarck, N.D., liquidate all financial assets and file for
personal bankruptcy. His wife, Cindy, has gone to work in a bingo
hall because the $923 in monthly disability checks he receives from
Social Security isn't enough to meet everyday expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Goehring realizes now that he could have avoided such financial
devastation had he maintained comprehensive disability coverage,
which would have replaced a portion of his $60,000 annual income.
When he started his business, though, he felt healthy and strong,
and thought that disability insurance was a waste of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a crap shoot and I lost,'' said Goehring, 45, who is a
former wrestling coach and the father of a college-age son and
teenage daughter, and who now needs help walking and getting out of
chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance industry statistics show that the odds of suffering a
debilitating injury or illness are far greater than dying during
one's working years. Yet more people are likely to have life
insurance than disability insurance _ roughly 70 percent versus 40
percent, according to the Health Industry Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   The association says that about 30 percent of people 35 to 65
will suffer a disability for at least 90 days, and about one in
seven can expect to become disabled for five years or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think of life insurance long before they think of
disability insurance, but, in fact, if you're a working adult and
you do not have anyone who is financially dependent upon you, you
may not really need it,'' said Larry Elkin, a financial planner in
Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. ``A disability, which cuts off the
person's own income, can be devastating if a person does not have
any other source of income.''
</P>
<P>
   Disability coverage for workers is becoming increasingly
important as baby boomers, who make up a huge part of the work
force, continue to age. Douglas Frantzen, a senior vice president
for the UnumProvident Corp., which is based in Portland, Maine.,
and is one of the nation's largest disability insurance providers,
says UnumProvident has seen ``double-digit sales growth in the last
year or two,'' though he declined to provide specific numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Many workers are covered by their employers _ nationally,
roughly 40 percent of midsize and large companies and 20 percent of
small employers provide long-term disability, according to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics. (Laws vary from state to state; in New
York and New Jersey, employers must provide at least a short-term
policy _ up to 26 weeks of coverage.) And nearly all employers
provide some short-term leave, often as paid sick days.
</P>
<P>
   But that still leaves a large portion of workers without
long-term coverage through their employers. And unless they buy
their own policies, the growing numbers of consultants,
free-lancers and other independent workers also lack such
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   High-profile examples of famous athletes or entertainers struck
down in their prime have helped hammer home the possibility of such
an event. Among the headline-grabbers were the highway crash last
month that left Derrick Thomas, a linebacker with the Kansas City
Chiefs, paralyzed and the horse-riding accident in 1995 that left
the actor Christopher Reeve a quadriplegic.
</P>
<P>
   Reeve was recruited by HealthExtras Inc. of Rockville, Md., to
help sell accident disability policies that pay out $1 million for
qualifying injuries. His face and words of advice appear on fliers
placed in credit card bills from several banks, including Citibank.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for HealthExtras, Marshall Coleman, said Reeve had a
four-year contract at $1 million a year, payable to the Christopher
Reeve Paralysis Foundation in Springfield, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term private disability policies typically provide monthly
payments of 60 percent of a person's income at the time of the
disability for an extended period, usually up to age 65. Many plans
have caps on what is paid out, usually around $5,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Elkin, the financial planner, says that the coverage is
especially important for family breadwinners _ and that it should
be for accidents and illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (Goehring, for example, had an accident policy, but none
covering illness.)
</P>
<P>
   Disability insurance through an employer, worker's compensation
and Social Security can help those who become disabled, but each
has its shortcomings. Most employer plans typically last only up to
six months, and coverage stops when employment ends.
</P>
<P>
   Worker's comp covers only those disabilities suffered on the
job, and plans differ by state in benefits and eligibility. Social
Security does not kick in until several months after a disability
and carries numerous restrictions. And none of these may come close
to paying 60 percent of lost income. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A typical income-replacement plan pays policyholders if they can
no longer work in the field in which they were employed or trained,
or makes up the difference if they no longer can earn as much as
they did in that field. Less expensive plans consider people
disabled only if they cannot engage in any occupation. Most
financial advisers favor the former.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a neurosurgeon, a hand injury might make you
disabled for purposes of your own occupation, but it won't disable
you for the purpose of teaching surgery,'' Elkin said. ``There's an
enormous difference in definition and income.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial advisers also recommend policies that are ``guaranteed
renewable,'' which means that the insurance company cannot refuse
to renew a policy and cannot change any terms except the premium
cost. For an additional premium, a cost-of-living adjustment can be
included.
</P>
<P>
   To save money, Robert Hunter, director of insurance for the
Consumer Federation of America, an advocacy group based in
Washington, recommends that consumers buy policies with a longer
waiting or ``elimination'' period, the minimum time a person must
be disabled before collecting benefits. The shorter the period, the
higher the cost.
</P>
<P>
   The average waiting period is 90 days, but some people may be
able to extend that to a year or so by tapping into short-term
benefits offered by employers or through emergency savings, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Buying through a group plan can cost 30 percent to 50 percent
less than than buying an individual policy, Frantzen said. If a
company does not offer a long-term plan, employees can ask if a
group can be formed for that purpose. Professional organizations,
trade groups and unions also might offer group coverage, Hunter
said.
</P>
<P>
   UnumProvident said a 40-year-old man earning $46,200 a year
could expect to pay $1,450.80 a year in premiums for an individual
plan with a guaranteed renewable policy that kicks in after 90 days
and covers his ``own occupation.'' With a six-month waiting period,
the annual cost falls to $1,357.29; if bought as part of a group
plan, it drops to $975.17.
</P>
<P>
   Some insurance carriers have stopped offering individual
policies because they are more costly to provide and difficult to
underwrite. They focus instead on group plans. Others, burned by
fraudulent claims, have imposed restrictions. UnumProvident
redesigned its products in the mid-1990s and abandoned its most
liberal offering, a nondeductible guaranteed renewable plan.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said insurance agents typically did not push disability
plans, because they have lower commissions than products like whole
life insurance _ about 30 percent of the first year's premiums,
versus about 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Goehring wishes his agent had pushed for comprehensive
disability coverage when he bought insurance years ago. ``The thing
is, you can't buy everything that is available,'' he said.

ENTHUSIASM FOR MCCAIN OVERFLOWS IN SOUTH CAROLINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. _ Before they arrived here a few days ago,
Senator John McCain and his aides were optimistic about South
Carolina's Feb. 19 primary but keenly aware of the challenge ahead.
Yes, Governor George W. Bush of Texas had a 20-point lead in the
polls here, but there was time, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 18 days,'' went the mantra.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after trouncing Bush in New Hampshire and after three days
in the Palmetto State, everything has been turned on its head. The
poll gap has vanished, and McCain's audiences are so big here, they
have overwhelmed organizers, cramming venues chosen when
expectations were smaller. And the groups are even more adoring
than McCain's Granite State throngs, many of them using the
opportunity to tell the Arizona senator how much they admire him
and want him to be president.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't supposed to happen yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping to be 10 or 12 points behind by the time we
landed in South Carolina,'' said John Weaver, McCain's political
director. ``I don't like to believe polls, but I believe my eyes,
and my eyes tell me we're very competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of having two more weeks to grab the lead, McCain
has two weeks left in which to battle not to lose it.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his aides are jubilant over the events of the past
few days, a giddy high only magnified by news that he will now be
allowed to compete in the New York primary. The reeling Bush
campaign, meanwhile, reportedly plans to convene a Texas meeting of
top campaign officials to map out a new battleplan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say the Bush campaign hit a bump in the road,'' McCain,
flanked by two suits of armor, told a crowd of 2,000 at the
Medieval Times theater restaurant Friday morning, referring to
Bush's concession speech in New Hampshire. ``I think it tore out
the transmission!''
</P>
<P>
   He has been using variations on that line most everywhere he has
gone in the past few days. He used it at the rallies with college
students, the first of which began in Greenville about 3 a.m.
Wednesday, and ended, like the others, with a burst of confetti,
flag-waving, and thumping music worthy of a president.
</P>
<P>
   And again in the affluent community of Seabrook Island, where
Bill Bradley supporter Nancy Dawe sent $100 to McCain ``to level
the playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's unfair, the $65 million man against this guy,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   He also used it at a huge meeting at the Charleston Maritime
Center, where organizers decided not to have McCain take questions
as he usually does, because the expected crowd of several hundred
had ballooned to a thousand. And then at the Georgetown Fire
Station, where the crowd spilled out past the firetrucks and across
the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came for the spectacle of it. He's really come on strong
after New Hampshire,'' said Dan Stacey, 29, of Georgetown, who was
standing on Prince Street outside the firehouse trying to catch a
glimpse of the candidate. ``He merits attention. I just wanted a
chance to see a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Tuesday night, McCain has been laying claim to a quality
more closely associated with the Texas governor until now:
electability.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message to Republican leaders is that we can win,'' McCain
said Wednesday at a press conference in Greenville. ``This kind of
motivation, this kind of enthusiasm that we've generated in New
Hampshire we can generate here in South Carolina, will make for
winning campaigns all over this country.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been more of the heir-apparent about McCain since
Tuesday night. Wednesday morning's orderly press conference was a
rare event in a campaign more commonly characterized by press
scrums. Lately, the senator has been more formal and upright on
stage, swapping his usual pacing, and his white-knuckled grip of
the microphone stand, for a less casual stance.
</P>
<P>
   His speeches are far more consistent than those in the past,
forgoing detailed descriptions of his policies in favor of more
generalized, sharper, more predictable delineations of his major
themes: campaign-finance reform, use of the surplus, respect for
the military, and his credibility as a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire has given McCain more than what he often says is
``a megaphone'' for his ``crusade'' against the influence of
special interests. It has given him a justification for his appeal
to a wider audience than conservative Republicans, the traditional
state primary audience. Over and over, he tells audiences here that
his New Hampshire victory attracted new voters that the Republican
Party has been coveting for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the way in, several independents and Democrats stopped me
and said, `I'm voting for you,' '' McCain said Thursday. ``My dear
friends, these are the people we used to call the Reagan
Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   But his campaign is defined by its underdog status, and McCain
and his aides are making it clear that he is still the scrappy
battler he always was. McCain, who says he feels more comfortable
when he is slightly behind, told reporters on his bus Friday that
he was sure the polls would ``bounce up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   He is still campaigning as the antiestablishment candidate. The
campaign has busily launched preemptive strikes against claims made
by Bush surrogates that McCain is too liberal.
</P>
<P>
   At each event here, he has been introduced by US Representatives
Mark Sanford or Lindsey Graham, who say McCain is a threat to the
establishment. They say the establishment is out to get McCain by
comparing him to Clinton, and calling him a liberal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you believe that?'' they ask audiences, which roar and
laugh at the preposterousness of the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is Bush who has 14 days to regain an edge on McCain, an
advantage that once seemed so easy and enduring. And McCain's
campaign, which got ahead in New Hampshire and had to hold the lead
for six weeks, knows doing it again will take work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our battle right now is to fight and scratch and claw for
every vote,'' Weaver said. ``And that's what our schedule will
reflect.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw what happened in a matter of three days. The opposite
can happen if we become anything but aggressive,'' he said.

FOR PRADA, THE SERIES BECOMES DO OR DIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ Italy's Prada Challenge cracked under
the excruciating pressure of the tie-breaking Race 7 Friday, while
the San Francisco-based America One syndicate dominated at every
stage. Friday's 66-second defeat pushed Prada, now down by 4-3
entering Race 8 on Saturday, to the brink of elimination in the
five-of-nine-race Louis Vuitton series.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the challenger series will face the defender, Team
New Zealand, in the America's Cup finals, scheduled to begin on
Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be a hard thing for them to stomach, to see
somebody come back after they were down, 3-1,'' the America One
skipper, Paul Cayard, said. ``The facts are they have a fast boat
and they can sail very well. But people are people, and there's a
human factor to this whole thing. And that factor is now on our
side.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, it was a human error by the Prada tactician Torben
Grael that spelled doom for the Italian chances. ``There are some
days when you shouldn't get out of bed, and today was one of those
days,'' Grael said at the postrace news conference, referring to
his decision to hew to the left side of the course in the first leg
as the Americans stayed right.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to get it right all the time,'' Grael said.
``We thought the left side was going to be better for more
pressure, but we understand that we were wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, the Italians sailed as if they were in a haze.
On the other hand, Cayard was in a sharp, feisty mood. He was ready
to tangle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Main out, Terry,'' he urged his mainsail trimmer, Terry
Hutchinson. ``You're stalling me, buddy.''
</P>
<P>
   America One twice engaged the Italians, but they were not game.
Cayard controlled the start and hit the line at full speed, sliding
past the committee boat and off to the right. On the opposite end
of the line, the Prada helmsman Francesco de Angelis needed to
pinch his bow up into the wind to skirt around the starting buoy.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first, almost imperceptible sign of looming trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians continued to spin away to the left. As in Race 6,
the tacticians _ Prada's Grael and America One's John Kostecki _
were betting on different sides of the course. Grael called for a
tack, and both boats lined up on port and continued upwind.
</P>
<P>
   Prada, from its position inside the Americans, took the lead.
The Italians were exactly where they needed to be, in control and
in contact.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Grael peered to the left and saw something. Perhaps it was
a patch of dark water he took for better air pressure. Maybe it was
the suggestion of an even stronger left-hand shift.
</P>
<P>
   Something.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians tacked for it. But it was a mirage, a fleeting
image of glory unrealized.
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, the Italians had self-destructed by measure of a
simple, unforced error.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the course's opposite side, America One held course and
then spun back on the heels of a strong, favorable right-hand shift
that brought fresher breeze as well. For Prada, it was a double
whammy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hung to their lefty for a long time,'' Cayard said.
``There were two winds and basically a no-man's land in the middle.
But we had more pressure than they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Prada continued, its options limited to hoping for a change in
the breeze as fortuitous as the one the Americans now enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind is coming, the wind is coming,'' a Prada crew member
said, almost willing it to be so.
</P>
<P>
   But his plea went unanswered. At one point, the side-by-side
separation of the two boats was more than a mile. Prada and America
One were, quite literally, sailing in different waters. The
Americans tacked just twice up the beat and rounded the top mark, 1
minute 19 seconds ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians could only hope for an American breakdown, and
their wish was partly granted. Moments after hoisting the
spinnaker, the boom vang aboard America One parted. The broken
hardware, which controls the mainsail boom and hence the set of the
main, temporarily slowed Cayard's progress.
</P>
<P>
   It was not enough, however, for Prada to make a significant
gain. At the second of the 18.5-mile course's five turning marks,
the Italians had gained back only six seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Sailing from a position of power, Cayard would not let de
Angelis climb off the mat. Kostecki was now in a zone, hitting
another huge shift and extending his boat's widening gap. At mark
No. 3, the lead had extended to 2:31.
</P>
<P>
   The rout was on. With main halyard problems on the last leg,
Cayard took his foot off the accelerator, and the Italians closed
within 1:06. But it was not really that close.

<P>
   Like Bill Gates and Michael Dell, Larry Augustin spent his spare
time in college toying with computers and wound up starting a
company that made him a zillionaire. But unlike them, Augustin
earned a college degree, at Notre Dame, and later a doctorate, at
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   And so he comes across as less the entrepreneur from birth than
the nerd's nerd, never happier than when up to his eyes in bits and
bytes and the esoterica of hardware and software.
</P>
<P>
   He proudly asserts that he was a charter subscriber to Sys
Admin, a trade magazine devoted to systems administrators, the
unsung heroes who keep computer systems running. ``I've been a
systems administrator for every operating system created in the
last 20 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Augustin's company, VA Linux Systems, a maker of computer
systems in Sunnyvale, Calif., does not yet have billions of dollars
in revenue. But it does have a multibillion-dollar market
capitalization, thanks to an initial public offering in December
that set records for first-day gains. And the stock provided most
of the $1 billion that Va Linux agreed to pay last week for
Andover.Net, an owner of Web sites offering technology news.
</P>
<P>
   From a high of $320, Va Linux shares have dropped, closing at
$125 on Friday. But at age 37, Augustin still has a net worth of
about $825 million.
</P>
<P>
   VA Linux is a standard-bearer for the Linux operating system and
the Open Source movement. Augustin and the other founders of the
company, and the movement, contend that by making the computer code
underlying a program freely available, and readily modifiable by
anyone, a stronger system with fewer crashes results, ending the
domination of operating systems owned by one company, especially
Microsoft Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Linux is named for Linus Torvalds, a Finnish programmer who
wrote a key component, though he has no connection with the company
beyond his friendship with Augustin.
</P>
<P>
   In the hands of Torvalds and Augustin, Linux has practically
become a cult, although one with a sense of humor. Augustin breaks
out in high-pitched bursts of laughter as he describes an esoteric
online parody of slashdot.com, a Linux news site (``News for nerds.
Stuff that matters.'') owned by Andover.Net that doesn't take
itself too seriously to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   But go back to the late '80s and early '90s. Augustin had gone
to Stanford after three years at AT&AMP;T Bell Laboratories, where he
worked on high-speed digital switching. He ultimately wrote his PhD
thesis on electronic automated design tools, the software used to
create new chips.
</P>
<P>
   He also spent much time playing scavenger _ collecting, among
other things, cast-off disk drives, in the days when 30 megabytes
filled a refrigerator-sized box. He used these castoffs to create a
giant site, in a Stanford basement, that allowed the rapid exchange
of information over the Internet before the days of the World Wide
Web.
</P>
<P>
   He also collected early workstations made by Sun Microsystems.
His goal was to build a machine at his home that could use Unix, a
sophisticated operating system widely found in academia and
industry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Torvald released Linux on the Internet. Using this
software, Augustin said, ``I was able to put together my own
computer for $2,000, and it was one and a half to two times faster
than these old Suns, which cost about $7,000.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``Other people saw what I had and wanted one, so
in November '93, I put up a Web page and said, `I will sell people
these systems.' I got my first check at the end of the month from
someone I didn't know. I consider that the start of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of dozen companies have jumped on the Linux bandwagon,
based on the premise that there is money to be made selling an
operating system that anyone can obtain for free. VA Linux is
unusual in that it sells complete computer systems that come loaded
with Linux (but not Windows).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're designing from the ground up for Linux,'' he declared.
``And what we offer to our customers is not just a system. It's
full service, a single point of contact, service and support for
building their entire infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, VA Linux's major customers are all Web start-ups
themselves, companies like Akamai Technologies and eToys, and most
are less than two years old. But Augustin, whose buttoned-down
shirts, neatly creased khakis and well-trimmed hair may qualify as
the height of formality among Linux users, has positioned himself
as the person to take the Linux message to corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make the argument that the current model of software
development is just economically inefficient,'' he said. ``I think
this is the next big revolution in the software industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoking the revolution means long hours, he said recently,
describing his previous day, which began in New York and ended in
Silicon Valley. ``Yesterday I got up at 3 a.m. California time,
went into a set of meetings, got on an airplane, got back here at 3
in the afternoon and worked in the office until 7 p.m. when my wife
started calling.''
</P>
<P>
   Balancing work and family can mean taking his wife, Alice
Kitsuta Augustin, and daughter, Andrea, to industry gatherings like
last week's Linux World in New York. ``That's fine because we get
together with Linus and the kids can play,'' he said, alluding to
the fact that both of them have 3-year-old daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Augustin tells employees not to think about VA Linux's share
price, and he tries to take his own advice. ``I didn't start this
thing to cash in and get out,'' he said. ``I started this to build
a real company.''

INVESTING WITH JAMES B. CONHEADY: CONCERT INVESTMENT INTERNATIONAL
EQUITY FUND 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic of Concert Investment International Equity is
being sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make
individual purchase by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.) 
(af) 
 By JOANNE LEGOMSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   James B. Conheady, lead manager of the $156.2 million Concert
Investment International Equity fund, is fond of playing the odds
on thoroughbreds at Belmont Park.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, it's the markets that make him feel that he
is on a winning streak. The fourth quarter, when the fund rose 77.3
percent, ``was the best ever since I started investing in these
markets,'' Conheady said. That was in 1967, when international
investing was a rare, almost esoteric practice.
</P>
<P>
   Over the three years ended Jan. 28, his Concert fund returned
42.9 percent, annualized, versus 17.3 percent for the average
foreign stock fund, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago
financial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Conheady, 65, also has a hand in managing four other funds
sponsored by SSB Citi Asset Management, a unit of Citigroup, most
notably the $1.53 billion Smith Barney International Equity fund,
which returned 19.5 percent a year, on average, over the three
years.
</P>
<P>
   He said his Concert fund has benefited particularly from
small-capitalization stocks and new issues, which he does not
generally buy for the Smith Barney fund.
</P>
<P>
   Conheady does not use computer screening programs to find
stocks. He also has no tidy valuation parameters or formulas.
Instead, he and his second in command for the last 19 years,
Jeffrey J. Russell, harvest ideas from the Salomon Smith Barney
research staff and listen selectively to outside analysts, too.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, the two men visit more than 500 companies a year.
And they traipse to conferences, using them as opportunities to
meet management, analysts and industry experts.
</P>
<P>
   Conheady and Russell, who is 42, favor the stocks of established
growth companies, choosing those that are growing faster than
rivals in the same industry. They like companies with dominant
market positions in businesses that have significant barriers to
entry.
</P>
<P>
   Conheady said he especially likes companies that offer
incentives like stock options to management. ``Stock options are
key, especially for technology companies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He says he likes to let his ``winners run,'' _ that is, he
sticks with fast-growing companies when their high valuations might
deter more price-sensitive investors.
</P>
<P>
   But he pares back positions that grow to more than 5 percent of
the fund's 52-stock portfolio, to prevent excessive concentration.
And he does not rigorously allocate his portfolio assets according
to country, focusing more on investment themes.
</P>
<P>
   One of those themes is the trend among companies to outsource
manufacturing and services. Another is the long-term growth
possibilities of the telecommunications and technology industries,
which together make up more than half of the fund's assets.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fund's heavy exposure to those volatile sectors, its
beta _ or volatility relative to the market _ is roughly equal to
that of its benchmark, the Morgan Stanley Capital International
World Index. That is partly because of the fund's geographic
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Conheady will not put more than 25 percent of assets into any
single country, with the exception of Japan and Britain. Currently
the fund has 23.5 percent of its assets in Japan, 18.8 percent in
Britain, 34.9 percent in Continental Europe, 9.7 percent in the
Americas and the remainder elsewhere or in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Investing in the Softbank Corp., the Japanese Internet giant,
was a way to play both the Web and the Japanese economic recovery.
Softbank was an early investor in Yahoo and Yahoo Japan, and holds
stakes in more than 150 Internet businesses worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   He likes Softbank for being an incubator for Internet firms,
thus giving it stakes in yearlings that eventually go public.
``They invest in a diverse group of start-ups that copy business
strategies that were successful in the U.S.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Conheady is also bullish on the company's planned foray into
Japan's banking industry; he expects Softbank to either ally with a
bank or to buy a traditional lender.
</P>
<P>
   He took some profits when his Softbank position recently
breached his 5 percent limit, but he still likes the stock. He
began buying shares in May 1999, ending up with an average price
18,664 yen. They currently trade at 133,000 yen ($1,236.04), about
3408.5 times analysts' estimates of earnings for the fiscal year
ending March 2001.
</P>
<P>
   A trip to a research boutique in Toronto a year and a half ago
led Conheady to buy shares of Celestica Inc., a contract
manufacturer of routers, circuit boards and other products. The
stake reflects his enthusiasm for companies benefiting from the
burgeoning demand for outsourced services. ``High tech is the sweet
spot of the outsourcing trend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once part of IBM, Celestica has thrived since its initial
offering in June 1998. Its blue-chip customers include Lucent
Technologies and Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   He bought shares in the company, which is based in Toronto, at
an average price of 19.71 Canadian dollars. The shares closed on
Friday at 70 Canadian dollars ($48.5683).
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Conheady began accumulating shares of the Serco Group
of Southall, England, also to capitalize on growth in outsourcing.
Serco provides services for private industry and public agencies;
it manages prisons, operates hospitals and trains military
helicopter pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Serco won a 10-year contract to manage Britain's
nuclear weapons research and development center. Conheady remains
bullish on the shares, bought at an average price of 7.056 pounds.
The stock closed on Friday at 23.125 pounds ($36.9563).

GROWTH COMES FIRST, SAYS SOUTH AFRICA'S PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa _ In his sharpest challenge yet to South
Africa's powerful trade unions, President Thabo Mbeki vowed Friday
to relax restrictive labor laws, speed the pace of privatization
and reduce spending in the bloated public sector.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing Parliament in his first State of the Nation speech,
Mbeki highlighted the country's brightening economic fortunes and
signaled that his government would publicly battle the unions if
they stood in the way of desperately needed foreign investment and
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, when South Africa elected its first black
government, inflation has fallen to 5.2 percent from 12.5 percent,
he said. Foreign reserves, which stood at $5.2 billion last year,
have surged to $7.4 billion. And the economy, which experts say
grew by less than 1 percent in 1999, is expected to grow by at
least 6 percent over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki says the nation needs such growth to tackle the daunting
challenges of poverty and unemployment. And he warned that he would
not allow organized labor _ which has long supported Mbeki's party,
the African National Congress, but bitterly opposes its fiscally
conservative policies _ to threaten such growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jobs, a better life for our people in the context of a growing
economy and our standing in the eyes of the investor community
cannot be held hostage by elements pursuing selfish and antisocial
purposes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He did not say which labor laws would be changed, nor did he
indicate which government agencies might be privatized next. But
his remarks, which were applauded by opposition parties and
business leaders here, were clearly made with an eye to investors
abroad, who have long complained about South Africa's tough labor
laws, which make it very difficult to transfer, reassign or fire
employees.
</P>
<P>
   And just six months into his presidency, Mbeki seemed determined
to show the world that he would take the necessary steps to
liberalize the economy, even if that meant antagonizing his old
allies in the anti-apartheid struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki first signaled his willingness to challenge the unions
last summer when he refused to give public sector workers the
salary increases they wanted, saying the country could not afford
it. The decision touched off weeks of strikes and protests. But it
did not hurt the government's approval ratings, which have actually
improved during the last year _ driven in large measure by
increasing optimism about the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the challenges facing South Africa are enormous.
Unemployment stands at nearly 40 percent by some estimates, and the
economy has lost at least 500,000 jobs over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   About 3 million people still need housing, 7.5 million lack
access to running water and 21 million go without sanitation
services. An estimated 3.6 million of this nation's 44 million
people are believed to be infected with HIV, the virus that causes
AIDS. And crime rates are among the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The country's needs are painfully visible. Local politicians who
flew in for Mbeki's opening speech drove past hundreds of
dilapidated, tin-roofed shacks on their way to the elegant
Parliament building. Foreign direct investment, which increased to
$1 billion in 1998 from $150 million in 1993, has not come in fast
enough to put a real dent in such poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions, which began a
campaign of protests this week to highlight job losses, says the
government needs to create more jobs and to help ordinary people.
The organization found little comfort in Mbeki's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to his speech, officials at the South African
Municipal Workers Union said they feared the hasty restructuring of
state assets would only result in more pain for the poor. ``This
cannot be achieved by following the pattern so far, which has been
to slash jobs and privatize assets in the drive for a `lean and
mean' state,'' the union officials said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki, who also discussed racism, crime, AIDS and poverty,
acknowledged his country's many problems. But he insisted that
speedy economic growth was the only way to solve them.

SOME SEE BOTCHED DEAL IN MATTEL ACQUISITON OF TLC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Did the abrupt resignation of Jill Barad, Mattel's chief
executive, stem from Learning Co.'s lack of new best-selling
software titles, huge returns of unsold programs and costly sales
promotions?
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street thinks so. Considered a brilliant marketer, Barad
got Mattel, based in El Segundo, Calif., to spend $3.6 billion for
the Cambridge, Mass. software company last May _ a price some Wall
Street observers felt was too high.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Learning Co. has been losing money _ a staggering
$183 million in the fourth quarter and $206 million for the year.
The losses erased profits from all the other Mattel divisions and
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing I can say to gloss over how devastating
Learning Co.'s results have been to Mattel's overall performance,''
Barad told Wall Street analysts in explaining her departure
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Mattel was looking to expand into personal computer
software. The company saw Learning Co. with its well-known brands
like Broderbund software and household name ``edutainment'' titles
such as ``Reader Rabbit,'' ``Myst'' and the ``Where is Carmen
SanDiego'' series expanding sales for the maker of Barbie dolls,
Hot Wheels miniature cars, and Fisher Price toys. The purchase made
Mattel one of the biggest software developers.
</P>
<P>
   During the recent holiday selling season, nearly all parts of
Mattel prospered with higher sales than the previous year. The big
exception was Learning Co., whose revenues plunged 40 percent in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the poor financial results range from no new
best-selling software, a heavy reliance the repackaging of older
products and severe holiday pricing competition. So after the
holidays, Mattel wound up with an usually high number of unsold
programs, which like books, are returned by distributors and large
retailers, noted Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``TLC (The Learning Co.) is proving to be a black hole for the
company,'' noted Jill S. Krutick an analyst at Salomon Smith
Barney. ``In our opinion TLC's issues could prove difficult to
overcome in light of their complexity and the fast shifting
dynamics of the CD-ROM business.''
</P>
<P>
   To sell its products, Learning Co. and other education and
entertainment or ``edutainment'' companies offered mail-in coupons
for cash that also affected the company's profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Learning Co. got into the repackaging of its software ad
nauseum last year while some of their rivals really did redo old
titles,'' said Ellen Wolock, managing editor of the Childrens
Software Review, an influential bimonthly magazine based in
Flemington, N.J. ``You had the opinion that some of their newer
titles like the `ClueFinders,' series were just thrown together.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Learning Co.'s advertising and promotion costs
totaled more than 50 percent of its fourth quarter revenues _ much
higher than Mattel estimated. The company has not indicated how it
plans to restructure its interactive division, which includes
Learning Co.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Mattel's other software division, called Mattel
Interactive, did relatively well, selling some programs tied to
Hollywood. Two of them, ``Pokemon Studio Blue'' and ``Pokeman
Studio Red'' were big sellers during Decemeber.
</P>
<P>
   One insider, who asked not to be identified, called the
Mattel-Learning Co. deal, a ``botched acquisition.'' He said Mattel
is spending huge sums to operate two separate software companies _
Mattel Interactive and Learning Co._ each with their own
development, sales and marketing teams. Plans to integrate the two
into a single unit were never completed, and the strategy of
creating new software programs based on Mattel's well known
products other than Barbie have moved rather slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Mattel was slow to push sales of its products on the
Internet fearing loss of support from major retailers like WalMart,
the source added.
</P>
<P>
   But some industry watchers maintain that overall on-line sales
of consumer software products, particularly in education market
were miniscule last year. They also maintain that Mattel, under
Barad, overpaid for Learning Co. which claimed to have high profit
margins on software products it gained by cobbling together a
series of expensive acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way Learning Co. incurred huge debts before it was
refinanced by Thomas H. Lee Co. and Bain Capital Inc. in the summer
of 1997 when Learning Co. stock was less than $15 a share. The
stock doubled when Mattel acquired the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jill Barad was a willing buyer who wanted The Learning Co. to
be a salvation and she bought it from salesmen who wound up selling
her snake oil,'' said Sean P. McGowan, executive vice president of
Gerard Klauer Mattison, a New York investment firm who said he
tried to dissuade Barad from buying Learning Co.

U.S. TEMPORARILY RECALLING AMBASSADOR TO VIENNA 
</HEADLINE>
  (With AUSTRIA-POLITICS, AUSTRIA-ASSESS) 
(rk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Friday
that the United States was temporarily recalling its ambassador to
Vienna as one of several ``initial'' steps to distance the United
States from a governing coalition in Austria that includes a
rightist political party that has preached racial and religious
intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the inclusion this week of Austria's Freedom Party
in the new Austrian coalition was alarming not only in itself but
also because it could give a lift to fledgling right-wing
xenophobic movements throughout Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are deeply concerned about the Freedom Party's entry into
the Austrian government,'' she told reporters at a joint news
conference with Abel Matutes, the foreign minister of Spain.
``There is clearly no place inside the governments who make up the
Euro-Atlantic community _ and a healthy democracy _ for a party
that does not clearly distance itself from the atrocities of the
Nazi era and the politics of hate.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright said that although Ambassador Kathryn Hall would return
to Washington for consultations, it is expected she will go back to
Vienna. State Department officials said this was a lesser step than
a formal recall of an ambassador in which the envoy remains away
from the post indefinitely. Israel formally recalled its ambassador
to Vienna as soon as the new government was sworn in Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said several other steps were being taken, all of them
essentially symbolic. For one, the defense attache at the U.S.
Embassy in Vienna was instructed not to attend a ceremony with the
new Austrian defense minister, a Freedom Party member. Albright
said official contacts between Washington and Vienna would also be
reduced to some degree.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said that Stuart Eizenstadt, a deputy treasury
secretary who is President Clinton's special representative for
Holocaust issues, would be asked to monitor Austria's behavior in
connection with unresolved issues from World War II, including
reparations for forced labor.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said she had talked on the telephone with both
President Thomas Klestil of Austria and the man he named as the
nation's new chancellor, Wolfgang Schuessel. She said they noted
that the coalition did not include the Freedom Party's leader,
Joerg Haider, who has been criticized for remarks about Hitler's
labor policies and SS troops, although he later retracted them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Chancellor Schuessel told me is that they have looked
very carefully at the members of the Freedom Party that they have
taken into their government and, in fact, turned down some
candidates as unacceptable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked her views of Haider's efforts to repeal or downplay his
earlier remarks, Albright said flatly that she continued to find
his views ``repugnant'' and that he was ``tapping into what I said
was this kind of xenophobic and anti-immigration and anti-human
rights policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be watching very carefully what they do,'' she said of
the Austrian government.

BUSH SAYS HE OPPOSES CONFEDERATE MONUMENT AT COURTHOUSE
</HEADLINE>

By R.A. DYER 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Responding to a growing controversy in his home
state, Gov. George W. Bush said on Friday that he opposes the
construction of a Confederate monument on the grounds of the Grimes
County courthouse near Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Bush apparently made the statement in response to a reporter's
question during an appearance with African American ministers in
Detroit. Bush aides in Austin confirmed the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Bush aides had said that the governor preferred to
leave the issue to the 18-member Texas Historical Commission, which
includes 12 of his appointees. Civil Rights leaders have expressed
opposition to the monument, which is proposed for the courthouse
grounds in Anderson, about 65 miles northwest of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Black ministers and others in the community said that they
oppose the statue because it would be a reminder of slavery. State
Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, has also said the commission should
reject the monument, which would include the confederate battle
flag on some occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis and other groups have said the flag, which has sometimes
been used by hate groups, was used by segregationists during the
1960s Civil Rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am glad to see that Governor Bush has joined us in
opposition to the proposed statue for Grimes County because of its
racially divisive display of the Confederate battle flag,'' Ellis
said. ``The governor recognizes that symbols of hate have no place
in 21st Century America. I hope he will join our effort to remove
other symbols of hate on display across our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Grimes County Greys Camp of the Sons of Confederate Veterans
has raised about $40,000 for the statue. The monument is to include
a six-foot bronze infantryman gripping a rifle that on special
occasions could be replaced by a Confederate flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hate groups who unfortunately have appropriated our
flag, and we cannot control that,'' said Dal Dreher, commander of
the Grimes County Grey Camp. ``Our whole objective is to honor our
ancestors and to keep our Confederate history in front of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil Rights leaders have also called for the removal of
Confederate plaques at the Texas Supreme Court building and asked
that Texas schools be barred from displaying the battle flag. The
governor has said local school districts should decide whether to
allow the flag, and has called upon the Texas General Services
Commission to erect an explanation of the plaque at the Supreme
Court building.
</P>
<P>
   The plaques were included in the building because it was paid
for with money from a Confederate Veterans group.

JOB GROWTH SURGED IN JANUARY, KINDLING PROSPECT OF INFLATION

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Far from easing off as the U.S. economic expansion was becoming
the longest in history, the nation's employers added more jobs in
January than they had in any single month in more than two years _
drawing in people who had given up looking for work and easing the
struggle of millions of workers to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   The January increase of 387,000 new jobs was the biggest jump
since September 1997, when employees of United Parcel Service,
returning from a strike, swelled the count to 408,000, the Labor
Department reported Friday. The unemployment rate ticked down
another notch, to 4 percent, the lowest level in exactly 30 years.
It had been 4.1 percent since October.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street saw the January employment numbers as fresh evidence
of a rising inflation rate, if not right away, then by early spring
_ the concern being that a shortage of workers forces employers to
pay higher wages and then to raise prices to cover the added labor
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These latest numbers do not give any evidence of the slowdown
in the economy that many of us had been expecting in the new
year,'' said Edward McKelvey, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs.
``The next set of inflation numbers may be low, but the forces we
are seeing threaten to push inflation higher soon.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the employment report, bond traders pushed up
interest rates mildly, reversing course after having driven down
rates all week. They had been in a turmoil over the Clinton
administration's plan to shrink the national debt faster than
expected. As the debt shrinks, so does the number of Treasury bonds
issued by the government to finance the debt. That prospect had
people rushing to buy bonds while the supply lasted. The demand
drove up bond prices and drove down the interest rates that the
Treasury must pay to get people to buy its bonds.
</P>
<P>
   But while Wall Street saw inflation in the employment report,
the Clinton administration saw stability, and also the danger that
rising rates _ pushed up too quickly by bond traders and the
Federal Reserve _ could water down the economic boom in an election
year. The Fed raised short-term interest rates Wednesday by
one-quarter of a percentage point and warned of ``heightened
inflation pressures in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, however, insisted in an interview
Friday that the labor market, despite the low unemployment rate,
was not inflationary. ``We cannot continue to have these quick
reactions to the employment numbers; we have to take the long
view,'' she said. ``This is a strong economy that is in balance
with a significant pool of people available to take on more work.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman argued that a fluke drove up job growth in January. Of
the 387,000 jobs created in January, nearly half _ 169,000 _ were
the result of an unusual spell of warm weather in mid-January, just
when her department was taking its monthly job survey, she said. As
a result, construction jobs rose by 116,000 rather than a more
normal 18,000 for January, and there were similar spikes in
industries related to construction _ landscape gardening, for
example, and the manufacture of plywood and concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Take away the 169,000 and job growth in January was only
218,000, Herman insisted. That is still too much, Wall Street
economists said. The economy can average a maximum of only 150,000
new jobs a month and still avoid an unacceptable rise in the
inflation rate, said Chris Varvares, a partner at Macroeconomic
Advisers Inc., a St. Louis, Mo., forecasting service.
</P>
<P>
   Job growth averaged 234,000 a month last year, an unusually high
level of job creation for an expansion that became 107 months old
this week, the longest in history and one month older than the
1960s expansion.
</P>
<P>
   If all these new jobs are inflationary, the evidence is missing
from the Labor Department's wage data. The average hourly pay of
the nation's non-supervisory production workers _ about 90 million
people in a work force of 130.3 million last month _ rose by 6
cents in January, to $13.50 an hour. That represents an annual rise
of just 3.5 percent, down from an annualized increase of 3.7
percent last fall. Most other labor cost indexes are also rising
mildly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Whatever the inflationary impact of a booming job market, the
monthly job reports, including the one in January, suggest that
millions of Americans are finding it easier to make ends meet. The
percentage of the work force holding two or more jobs, for example,
fell to 5.7 percent last month from 6 percent in January of last
year _ suggesting that more and more people now earn enough at one
job to get by or get enough extra hours from their employer to
avoid taking a second job, or both.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, the number of people stuck in part-time jobs because
they cannot get full-time work is shrinking. And so is a pool of
people who say they would like to work but are not looking, because
they are discouraged or think they cannot find work or cannot
arrange child care, transportation and the like. Since they are not
actively looking for work, they are not included in the labor
force, even as unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   But these are the people who are being drawn increasingly into
jobs. Their numbers have dwindled steadily from 6.7 million in
January 1994, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics first started to
track them, to 4.7 million in January 1999 and to 4.3 million last
month, the Bureau reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That means a pool of more than 10 million people still to draw
from, including the 6 million who are listed as actively looking
for work and therefore officially unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``An economy where jobs are looking for people as well as people
looking for jobs is one of the best social programs we have,'' said
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers at a news conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The weather was not the only factor in driving up job creation
last month. The Census Bureau added 11,000 people in January as it
geared up for the 2000 census. After months of cutting back,
manufacturers have begun to add people, including 13,000 in
January. With oil prices rising, the petroleum industry is also
adding people, particularly to drill for oil. Retailers added
43,000 people, which is unusual so soon after Christmas, although
consumer spending continues to be robust. There were also increases
in the computer industry and child care, which like retailing and
manufacturing reflected the robust economy.

VODAFONE CHIEF HINTS AT FURTHER EXPANSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUESSELDORF, Germany _ Vodafone AirTouch PLC's triumphant $183
billion takeover agreement for Mannesmann AG of Germany aroused an
appetite for telecommunication stocks across Europe on Friday, and
the British mobile phone leader hinted that its expansion was not
yet complete.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking after Mannesmann's supervisory board ratified the
biggest takeover deal of all time, Vodafone's chief executive,
Christopher Gent, said he was interested in other acquisitions and
tie-ups, including a broader alliance with News Corp., one of the
world's biggest media conglomerates. News Corp. already provides
some content for Vodafone services.
</P>
<P>
   Gent's tenacity in pursuing Mannesmann ended in victory on
Thursday, when the German industrial-telecommunications
conglomerate, the biggest mobile phone company in Europe,
capitulated to an all-stock offer from Vodafone after resisting for
three months.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone's successful bid for Mannesmann marks the first truly
cross-border hostile takeover in Germany and is viewed as a
potential catalyst for a spate of cross-border mergers that were
once considered unachievable on the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover also puts pressure on rival mobile phone companies
to merge or risk getting gobbled up by the combined
Vodafone-Mannesmann, which, with more than 42 million subscribers,
is the largest mobile phone company in the world. Its nearest
competitor in Europe, Telecom Italia, has 17.8 million customers,
according to estimates by Lehman Brothers investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of European telecommunication companies surged Friday on
speculation that more deals would soon develop. Shares in Royal KPN
of the Netherlands, for example, rose 18.7 euros, to 121 euros, and
shares of France Telecom rose 8.6 euros, to 162 euros.
</P>
<P>
   Orange PLC, Britain's third-largest mobile phone company, which
was acquired by Mannesmann and will now have to be spun off by
Vodafone to appease regulators, is seen by analysts as the most
obvious target for a takeover. Shares of Orange jumped 40 pence, or
1.63 percent, to 25.50 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to securities analysts in London, Gent detailed the
terms of the deal, which was negotiated in Mannesmann's
headquarters city of Duesseldorf earlier in the week and announced
at a curt news conference late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement approved Friday by Mannesmann's supervisory
board, Mannesmann shareholders will control 49.5 percent of the
combined company and will get 58.96 Vodafone shares for each share
of the German company that they own, up from the original 53.7
offered. Based on Vodafone's closing share price Wednesday of 3.855
pounds, or $6.21, the day before word of the deal got out, the
total value is about $366.14 a share, or $183 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts suggested that Vodafone's success will now give it a
competitive advantage over just about every other player in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``While the deal was initially driven by Vodafone's desire to
gain control of the critical Italian and German mobile markets, the
bid ended up focusing more on the ability to gain critical scale
and scope to exploit wireless data and Internet opportunities and
offer seamless pan-European-global data services to the mobile
market,'' said Christian Kern, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Klaus Esser, the embattled chief executive of Mannesmann, will
stay with the company as chief executive for five months, helping
integrate the two businesses. This summer he will assume the
position of non-executive deputy chairman. Esser will also keep a
seat on the company's board of directors, and Mannesmann will
choose directors to fill four other seats of the 19-member board.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Analysts applauded Esser's decision to remain with the company.
``Dr. Esser significantly reduces the `execution risk' of this
transaction,'' said Kern. ``Dr. Esser has been instrumental in
building Mannesmann to its present status. His departure could have
prompted others to leave as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Gent downplayed any animosity between him and Esser. ``People
like to sort of set this up as an adversarial contest,'' Gent told
CNBC. ``We get along very successfully when we're not pictured as
adversarial.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While Esser clearly lost the battle to keep Mannesmann
independent, in many ways he did achieve an agreement that
fulfilled many of the goals that seemed unattainable when the brawl
began.
</P>
<P>
   He ended up getting about 353 euros per share for his
stockholders, above his stated goal of 350 euros per share. When he
initially said he believed Mannesmann was worth 350 euros a share,
Vodafone's offer was only worth 263 euros per share. The run-up in
the price of shares of telecommunications companies and a 5 percent
increase in Vodafone's offer put the value of the deal at the level
Esser had sought.
</P>
<P>
   Esser also insisted that Mannesmann's combination of mobile,
fixed and data networks be kept intact, though initially Vodafone
vowed to spin the assets off. When Vodafone detailed the terms of
the agreement Friday, it pledged not to dispose of the wireline
activities. The combined company will keep one of two European
headquarters here and no job cuts are expected.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Vodafone fell 6 percent, to 346.5 pence, while
Mannesmann dropped 1.1 percent, or 3.45 euros, to 322.05 euros.

U.S. TEMPORARILY RECALLING AMBASSADOR TO VIENNA 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS quote in last line) 
 (With AUSTRIA-POLITICS, AUSTRIA-ASSESS) 
(rk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Friday
that the United States was temporarily recalling its ambassador to
Vienna as one of several ``initial'' steps to distance the United
States from a governing coalition in Austria that includes a
rightist political party that has preached racial and religious
intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the inclusion this week of Austria's Freedom Party
in the new Austrian coalition was alarming not only in itself but
also because it could give a lift to fledgling right-wing
xenophobic movements throughout Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are deeply concerned about the Freedom Party's entry into
the Austrian government,'' she told reporters at a joint news
conference with Abel Matutes, the foreign minister of Spain.
``There is clearly no place inside the governments who make up the
Euro-Atlantic community _ and a healthy democracy _ for a party
that does not clearly distance itself from the atrocities of the
Nazi era and the politics of hate.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright said that although Ambassador Kathryn Hall would return
to Washington for consultations, it is expected she will go back to
Vienna. State Department officials said this was a lesser step than
a formal recall of an ambassador in which the envoy remains away
from the post indefinitely. Israel formally recalled its ambassador
to Vienna as soon as the new government was sworn in Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said several other steps were being taken, all of them
essentially symbolic. For one, the defense attache at the U.S.
Embassy in Vienna was instructed not to attend a ceremony with the
new Austrian defense minister, a Freedom Party member. Albright
said official contacts between Washington and Vienna would also be
reduced to some degree.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said that Stuart Eizenstadt, a deputy treasury
secretary who is President Clinton's special representative for
Holocaust issues, would be asked to monitor Austria's behavior in
connection with unresolved issues from World War II, including
reparations for forced labor.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said she had talked on the telephone with both
President Thomas Klestil of Austria and the man he named as the
nation's new chancellor, Wolfgang Schuessel. She said they noted
that the coalition did not include the Freedom Party's leader,
Joerg Haider, who has been criticized for remarks about Hitler's
labor policies and SS troops, although he later retracted them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Chancellor Schuessel told me is that they have looked
very carefully at the members of the Freedom Party that they have
taken into their government and, in fact, turned down some
candidates as unacceptable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked her views of Haider's efforts to repeal or downplay his
earlier remarks, Albright said flatly that she continued to find
his views ``repugnant'' and that he was ``tapping into what I said
was this kind of xenophobic and anti-immigration and anti-human
rights policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be watching very carefully what they do,'' she said of
the Austrian government. ``These are our initial steps in watching
what is happening.''

 &HT;    Racing on clay growing in exposure, prize money
 &HT;    By Rick Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In stock-car racing, 1999 was Dale's year. Dale
Jarrett won the Winston Cup championship. Dale Earnhardt Jr. took
the title in Busch Grand National. And Dale McDowell from
Rossville, Ga., won the Hav-A-Tampa Dirt Racing Series.
</P>
<P>
   If the 11-year-old dirt track series continues to grow, McDowell
could begin to experience some of the fame and fortune enjoyed by
those other Dales.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 season starts this weekend at Golden Isles Speedway in
Brunswick, with the 100-lap feature scheduled today. It's the first
of 44 events in a series started by Jimmy Mosteller from Smyrna as
a regional circuit for Saturday-night racers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Hav-A-Tampa series has grown into the nation's top
circuit for dirt stock cars. Purses are high enough to allow
drivers to race full-time. Winners earn between $5,000 and $53,000
per race from purses that average about $90,000. The season
champion gets another $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   McDowell collected more than $360,000 in prize money last year.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the series is poised to take a giant leap in
exposure. On June 2-3, Tennessee's Bristol Motor Speedway, a
Winston Cup track, will be covered in clay and the Hav-A-Tampa gang
will race under the lights.
</P>
<P>
   On July 2-3 and again on Sept. 22-23, the series will run on a
four-tenths-mile dirt track under construction on the grounds of
Lowe's Motor Speedway in Charlotte, N.C. Texas Motor Speedway also
has plans to build a dirt track.
</P>
<P>
   Humpy Wheeler, president of the Charlotte track, says fans are
craving to see ``rock-'em, sock-'em, sideways'' dirt racing. The
World of Outlaws, which also races on dirt, is the fastest growing
form of motorsports, Wheeler said, and the Hav-A-Tampa series only
needs more TV exposure to experience the same rate of growth.
</P>
<P>
   ''The racing public is telling us something,'' Wheeler said. ''I
call it retro-racing: the way we used to do it. People love to see
race cars go sideways.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosteller, who stands 5-feet-3 1/2 and has long been known as
racing's ``Little Bitty Buddy,'' got the series started at a time
when others might have been content to sit on the couch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to give up (full-time) announcing in 1982 when I had a
massive heart attack,'' said Mosteller, 73. ``But I got back into
racing because I had a lot to live for. I wanted to do something
for dirt racing before I died.''
</P>
<P>
   What he did in 1989 was to persuade his employer _ the
Hav-A-Tampa Cigar Co. _ to back the concept of a traveling series
for dirt-track drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Mosteller since has retired from his job as a vice president of
the cigar company that sponsors the series, and Mike Swims, vice
president of Dixie Speedway in Woodstock, Ga., is head of the
series.
</P>
<P>
   Swims and his father, Dixie Speedway promoter Mickey Swims, also
played large roles in the creation of the Hav-A-Tampa series.
</P>
<P>
   Dirt racing is seen as a good learning experience for
prospective Winston Cup drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When these Winston Cup tracks get hot and greasy, the ones who
can drive a car under those conditions will come to the front,''
Wheeler said. ''Dirt tracks are the place to learn that.''
</P>
<P>
   McDowell said the dirt-track involvement of Wheeler and Speedway
Motorsports _ which owns several Winston Cup tracks, including
Lowe's, Atlanta, Texas and Bristol _ is a major boost for the
Hav-A-Tampa series. Running at Winston Cup facilities should
attract corporate sponsors to dirt racing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This year will tell the tale,'' McDowell said. ''I think it's
going to be big.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Estes, director of communications for the Bristol track,
said fan response already has been strong. ''People are buying
general-admission tickets six months in advance,'' he said.
''That's pretty doggone encouraging, since we didn't expect to sell
any general-admission tickets until the day of the race.''
</P>
<P>
   For McDowell, dirt-track races at Winston Cup venues will be
like old times.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s and early 1990s, he was an up-and-coming ARCA
super-speedway driver. A career in NASCAR's Busch Grand National or
Winston Cup division seemed just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   With advice and assistance from Winston Cup driver Davey Allison
and Red Farmer, McDowell finished second in an ARCA race at
Michigan International Speedway and scored two top fives at
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But when Allison died from injuries in a helicopter crash in
July 1993, McDowell lost a good friend and his best chance for a
career in NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to have some guidance to make it in that league,''
McDowell said. ''You have to be tied in with somebody, especially
if your last name isn't Earnhardt or Labonte or something like
that. It's tougher for an independent to get those doors opened.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the money to run in ARCA, McDowell decided to return to
the dirt tracks. But he said that, if the right opportunity came
along, he would go back to the super-speedways again.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these guys say, `I'm happy right here with dirt,'''
McDowell said. ``Well, that's bull. If they had a good opportunity
to go to Busch or Winston Cup, they'd do it.''

 &HT;    Museum takes aim at big leagues with exhibit of gigantic
skeletal duo
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like Zoo Atlanta's Lun Lun and Yang Yang, their names
are a bear to pronounce: Gee-guh-noe-toe-SAW-rus and
are-gin-teen-oh-SAW-rus.
</P>
<P>
   And the two gigantic dinosaur skeletons coming to Atlanta this
year are likely to do for the Fernbank Museum of Natural History
what the panda cubs have done for the local zoo: awe visitors and
raise attendance dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Fernbank announced last week it had a deal to import skeleton
casts of the biggest meat-eating and biggest plant-eating dinosaurs
to ever stomp the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The meat-eating Giganotosaurus was bigger and just as ferocious
as the toothy Tyrannosaurus rex of ``Jurassic Park'' fame. The
vegetarian Argentinosaurus was a meek, 100-ton giant _ and a
favorite food of the much-smaller Giganotosaurus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smaller'' can be a misleading term, of course, when you're
talking about dinosaurs. The Giganotosaurus was about the length of
one school bus; the Argentinosaurus was the length of three buses,
said Fernbank scientist Christine Bean.
</P>
<P>
   The fossils of the creatures, which died out 85 million years
ago, were discovered in the 1990s in Argentina. The Argentinosaurus
fossil, the only one ever found, hasn't been completely unearthed
yet. That's one reason its skeletal cast won't make it to Atlanta
until December. The Giganotosaurus model, based on one of two adult
fossils that have been found of that species, is expected at
Fernbank in June.
</P>
<P>
   The actual fossils can't be legally exported from Argentina, so
polyester-resin casts are being made of both. The fossils will
remain, unassembled, in an Argentine museum.
</P>
<P>
   Most dinosaur-skeleton displays are casts. Mounting actual
fossils can cause them to crack and bend. Only the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington and a few other museums around the world
have substantial displays of actual fossilized dinosaur bones.
</P>
<P>
   A partial cast of a Giganotosaurus skeleton is on display at the
Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia. But Fernbank officials
say that their exhibit will look more like the real thing, because
more fossils were found after Philadelphia's model was made, and
they'll be used to make the new cast.
</P>
<P>
   No other museum has assembled an Argentinosaurus skeleton.
</P>
<P>
   The design of its mammoth exhibit, to be placed in Fernbank's
now-empty Great Hall, is being reviewed by a team of scientists,
said museum President Susan Neugent. But it's certain the
Giganotosaurus will be chasing the Argentinosaurus, just as it did
in Argentina's then-lush Patagonia region millions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fernbank will have the only Argentinosaurus skeleton in the
world for years, Neugent said. Fernbank has an exclusivity
agreement that gives it the sole right to mount the
Argentinosaurus. It can't disclose the length of the agreement
because of a confidentiality clause. It had to pay a licensing fee
to the Argentine province whose museum owns the fossils, and is
paying for the casts to be made. Fernbank is trying to raise $1.25
million to cover those and other costs involved in the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Around the globe, paleontologists _ scientists who study
prehistoric life, including dinosaurs _ are almost as excited about
the display as the folks at Fernbank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be great for Atlanta,'' said Raymond Rye, chief dinosaur
expert for the Smithsonian in Washington. ``You're going to have
both the biggest meat eater and the largest plant eater. It's sort
of like AOL and Time Warner. It's a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Holtz, an expert on dinosaurs at the University of
Maryland, said the Argentinosaurus will be ``considerably bigger
than any other mounted skeleton. It's going to be pretty amazing.
Just the Argentinosaurus alone would be very impressive but to have
the two of them in a reconstruction of an ancient hunting scene
will be even more impressive. No one's done an exhibit like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the largest fighting dinosaur exhibit that I've
ever heard of.''
</P>
<P>
   All museums want to ``have the biggest, oldest, first, baddest''
dinosaurs, said Karl W. Flessa, a University of Arizona scientist
and past president of the Paleontological Society. Fernbank will
have both the biggest _ the Argentinosaurus _ and baddest _ the
Giganotosaurus.
</P>
<P>
   So how did a relatively unknown museum like Fernbank, which
opened just over seven years ago, get a crack at mounting the first
Argentinosaurus cast and the Giganotosaurus as well?
</P>
<P>
   Neugent said Fernbank made a bid and got the skeletons, in part
because its 72-foot-high Great Hall is big enough to display the
pair. ``The Fernbank Museum was designed with an installation of
this magnitude in mind,'' she said. ``We were just looking for the
right opportunity and the right creatures to feature in our Great
Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernbank's goal, she added, is ``to be on the cutting edge of
paleontology and to move to the forefront of natural history
museums.''
</P>
<P>
   After a team of scientists OKs the display's design, the
skeletal casts will be crated, shipped and assembled. A steel frame
will be constructed at Fernbank to hold up the skeletons.
</P>
<P>
   Both creatures were found in the badlands of Argentina's
Patagonia region, the biggest dino bone yard being studied.
</P>
<P>
   Paleontologist Rodolfo Coria, head of dinosaur research in the
Argentine bone yard and discoverer of the creatures, began a new
dig in the area Thursday, looking for more fossils.
</P>
<P>
   Are bigger dinosaurs going to be found?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' he quipped in an e-mail from Argentina.
``I'm a paleontologist, not a psychic.''
</P>
<P>
   Bean said that while the Argentinosaurus is considered the
largest dinosaur now, that could change.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what's going to be unearthed next,'' she said.
``For now, this is the longest and most massive known.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giganotosaurus was about 45 feet long and weighed about 10
tons _ 10 percent bigger than the T. rex. The Argentinosaurus was
about 120 feet long, weighed 100 tons and is 35 percent larger than
the Brachiosaurus, currently the largest mounted dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the T. rex, which killed its opponents with head-on
attacks, the Giganotosaurus leaped onto its prey and used its thin,
8-inch-long teeth, serrated like steak knives, to bleed and weaken
its foes. The two meat eaters were separated from each other by
oceans, and the Giga died out about 30 million years before the
last T. rex.
</P>
<P>
   With its enormous size, the Argentinosaurus had unusual
features, including cylindrical, hollow ribs and backbones with
holes in them to lighten its load. Its framework was strong but
light, like the wing bones of birds.
</P>
<P>
   The Fernbank display will depict the Giganotosaurus trying to
get at the much-larger Argentinosaurus. It'll also contain a
skeleton of a flying reptile called a Pterosaur, which lived all
over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Fernbank already has a 6-foot-long model of a Giganotosaurus
head and a giant vertebra of an Argentinosaurus. Neither will be
part of the new exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Neugent expects the exhibit to increase museum visitors
dramatically .
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting the largest dinosaurs that have ever been discovered
is Fernbank's most important accomplishment since opening,'' she
said. ``We expect that the dinosaurs will not only bring large
crowds on opening day, but that they will continue to draw
substantial attendance in the future as a permanent addition to the
museum.''

 &HT;    A minister shot by a stranger at a gas station _ wrestles with
the aftermath of violence
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Driving his 1992 gray Mustang on a late May evening,
the Rev. Frank Windom took his daughter, Hannah, to visit his
former wife, dropped off a prescription at a drugstore, and pulled
into his usual gas station _ the QuikTrip on the Lawrenceville
Highway near North DeKalb Mall in Tucker, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   With pump No. 8 filling the Mustang's tank, Windom was cleaning
the windshield when he noticed a man ambling toward him. Minutes
later, Windom was trying to retain consciousness as he lost blood
from a bullet that traveled through both legs and dented the
Mustang just under the windshield near the door seam.
</P>
<P>
   Windom, 59, a United Methodist minister whose career has been
devoted to poverty relief and justice, was the victim of a random
act of violence. Eight months after the shooting, Windom is still
sorting out his feelings.
</P>
<P>
   There is the apparent arbitrariness of it all: Windom was
wounded; another customer, social worker Eileen Goode, 53, was
killed; and other people at the station were unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   There is the question of accountability: Adrian Kahn, 27, is
charged with the assault of Windom and the murder of Goode. Kahn
was on his way to an appointment at a DeKalb County mental health
center, made after his wife called to let workers know he was
acting strangely and had a gun, according to Windom. Should Kahn,
if found guilty, be held responsible? Or had the system failed by
not sending police to handle the situation?
</P>
<P>
   And there is the age-old battle between good and evil: ``Christ
came into the world to bring light,'' Windom said. ``And in
Genesis, God made light out of total darkness. I'm reminded how, in
our personal lives and our community life, there seems to be
constant struggle between lightness and darkness. Both are part of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Windom has fought the darkness in neighborhoods
sometimes regarded as dangerous or at least seedy, the violence
touched him when he was running routine errands near his own home.
</P>
<P>
   'Gifted leader'
</P>
<P>
   A slight man with sparkling eyes, brown hair and a graying
beard, Windom is president of Action Ministries, a United Methodist
program that works with people on society's margins. On weekends,
he preaches at Aldora and Ebenezer United Methodist churches in
Lamar County, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly Urban Action, Action Ministries underwent a name change
in the late 1990s when United Methodist Bishop Lindsey Davis
charged it with administering a transitional housing program across
North Georgia, placing it in rural communities for the first time.
Today, the program operates or has in the planning stages more than
30 units for people struggling between homelessness and
self-sufficiency, funded with church donations and federal and
state grants.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry was already working through programs for prisoners,
drug addicts, children, the hungry, the homeless, people with AIDS,
pregnant teenagers and _ ironically for Windom _ victims of crime.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent weekday morning, Windom strolled into a room at St.
Paul United Methodist Church to meet the board of the Hall County,
Ga., branch of Action Ministries.
</P>
<P>
   From under his arm, Windom pulled notes for his report to the
group and his daughter Hannah's Girl Scout cookie sales sheet _
already nearly full.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah, 12, Windom's only child, is her troop's sales leader.
Over sandwiches and conversation about plans to open a new south
Hall building, concerns about a tenant's violent former husband,
and the need to provide more training to caseworkers, the dozen or
so people around the table dutifully signed up for Tagalongs and
Thin Mints to be delivered by Windom on a future visit.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Bancroft, director of Action Ministries in Gainesville,
Ga., has known Windom for 30 years. ``He's got a lot of courage,''
Bancroft said. ``He's willing to go out on a limb, find out what
you need and then try to make it fly financially.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is incredibly compassionate and a gifted leader in our
ministry with the poor,'' said Davis, Windom's bishop. Davis quotes
John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist movement, as saying, ``I
love the poor and in many of them I find pure, genuine grace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank embodies this spirit,'' said Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Community organizer
</P>
<P>
   Windom was a kid in College Park, Ga., when he began walking the
five blocks from his family's house to First Methodist Church
there. He felt drawn to the ministry about 1960 at Camp Glisson, a
United Methodist facility in North Georgia, where he worked as a
counselor while studying at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more a call into the ministry of the church than to a
preaching ministry,'' Windom said. ``I was shy. I didn't like to
speak in public.''
</P>
<P>
   He had chaplaincy internships at a mental health center and
Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta. He began work with what is now
Action Ministries in 1965, while still a student at Emory
University's Candler School of Theology, starting an after-school
program for students at Stewart Avenue United Methodist Church in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   At Tenth Street United Methodist Church, he established programs
for residents of nearby housing projects and helped organize the
Home Park neighborhood. The Northside Shepherd's Center grew out of
a program Windom created for older people. And his community
organizing pulled together businesses, residents and city
government to plan for the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neat thing is, having been a part in the '70s of a lot of
planning for that neighborhood, is seeing those things that were on
paper now a reality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once, he helped spearhead an effort by Atlanta residents to
reclaim 10th Street from pimps, prostitutes and drug dealers, who
plied their trades freely there, by staging a block party that drew
old people, families and children. Both Maynard Jackson, Atlanta's
first black mayor, and former Georgia Gov. Lester Maddox, who had
grown up in the neighborhood, addressed another gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my life has been directed to the coming together of
people,'' said Windom.
</P>
<P>
   A new wariness
</P>
<P>
   Windom's role in Action Ministries is as ``a visionary,'' said
Rocke (pronounced ``Rocky'') Thompson, who has administered grants
for Action Ministries since retiring from DeKalb County government
last summer. ``His style might be a bit loose for some people.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who describes himself as ``very disciplined,'' has
found a complementary spirit in Windom. The two enjoy talking
theology and sharing old war stories from their days as community
activists.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and Windom had already met for lunch to talk about a
possible role for Thompson at Action Ministries and had another
meeting scheduled for May 27. That morning, Windom's assistant
called Thompson to say Windom had been shot the night before.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was already on the phone that morning canceling and
rescheduling meetings,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Windom said, he did not realize how seriously he
had been injured.
</P>
<P>
   It was only later, in remarks from a physician and a paramedic,
that he realized he might have died. He feels some effects, both in
the slight limp he has acquired, and in his new skittishness around
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, after Windom had been out to eat with some friends, a
homeless man approached him, put his hands on him, and asked him
for money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him to get his hands off me,'' Windom said. ``Last
year, I wouldn't have said that. It just came out.''
</P>
<P>
   Windom said he has ``settled'' his feelings about Kahn. But the
questions about random violence, accountability, and darkness and
light linger.
</P>
<P>
   So does anger about the availability of guns, especially
semiautomatics ``that have no other use than shooting people.'' He
was shot with a semiautomatic handgun.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Windom also said, he was furious with mental health
professionals who had not comprehended the severity of Kahn's
disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that could happen in our work,'' said Windom. ``We make
decisions every day that involve people, and we try to do the best
we can at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the shooting, Windom said, he has been overwhelmed at the
idea that so many people were praying for him. Officials of the
QuikTrip Corp. visited him and donated $50,000 to the ministry. His
91-year-old former high school principal got in touch. A doctor's
gentle bathing of his injured legs reminded him of the sacramental
foot washing practiced in some churches.
</P>
<P>
   As a Christian, Windom has turned to the Scripture to see him
through, especially the passages about light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we're in the valley of darkness,'' he said, ``but
from a faith perspective, we live in the hope, expectation and
assurance that the light of our Lord is going to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   He also thinks about the Hebrew patriarch Jacob, who wrestled
with an angel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He struggled with God, and afterward he was lame,'' said
Windom.

 &HT;    Heading west for a theater in Portland, Ore., a home-grown
visionary shares his thoughts on the climate of Atlanta's arts
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 6.
 &HT;    By Kathy Janich
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Chris Coleman was a high school student in the
1970s, Atlanta's theater ``scene'' essentially consisted of the
Alliance, the Academy and the Vagabond Marionettes, which hadn't
yet become the Center for Puppetry Arts.
</P>
<P>
   In the two decades since _ including Coleman's 11 years as
co-founder and artistic director of the spunky, surprising and
visionary Actor's Express _ metro Atlanta's theater scene has grown
to include the Center for Puppetry Arts, 7 Stages, Horizon Theatre,
Jomandi Productions, Theatrical Outfit, Theatre in the Square,
Georgia Ensemble Theatre, Theatre Gael, Soul-stice Repertory, the
New American Shakespeare Tavern, the Georgia Shakespeare Festival,
PushPush Theater, Jewish Theatre of the South and Dad's Garage
Theatre Company _ whew _ among others.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it isn't healthy enough to keep him. In May, the
versatile 38-year-old actor/teacher/director becomes artistic
director of Center Stage in Portland, Ore., that city's largest
theater. Although Portland has a population of 500,000, one dwarfed
by metro Atlanta's millions, its Center Stage has a budget of $3.2
million compared with the Express' $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   Weary of scratching for funding and paying his actors poorly
($250 a week tops), the wiry, intense and confident Coleman has
opted for the picturesque Northwest. He leaves behind a lifetime of
memories and connections, family and friends, and partner Lonnie
Holloway, owner of Ultimate Event caterers, who plans to join him
in a year or so. Coleman also leaves behind an armload of thoughts
on the future of theater and the arts in Atlanta. He shared them
recently, as he fought flu symptoms in the Morningside duplex he
rents.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Not long ago Harriett Sanford, director of the Fulton County
Arts Council, said that Atlanta is in a cultural transition. How do
you see it?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'd agree. We're not a start-up community anymore. In the
theater community, we are viewed as one of the livelier hubs of
activity in the country. We're now trying to figure out, how do you
move from your adolescence into your adulthood? How do you sustain
organizations through the long haul? How do you create enough
funding to make it possible for artists to live and consider
staying in a city? How do you make it possible for the core
administrative staff to make it past that 10-year arc of start-up
passion that will fuel you through your poverty? How do you then
create enough of a funding base that allows an artist to mature
rather than burn out or take off or get a job at Turner? That's the
big question for the community right now. It's not been answered.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are your ideas?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think the Woodruff Foundation has got to play more of a
leadership role. They could say, ``OK, for the next five to eight
years, we're not going to give capital gifts in the arts field.
We're going to take all the money and put it into an endowment for
the arts in this city.'' That could look like $50 million or $60
million or $100 million without a whole lot of stretch on their
part. That's what the Metro Atlanta Arts Fund should become. They
should be operating at that kind of level so that they're giving
away $5 million to $6 million to $10 million a year off interest.
And that money is being used to do a couple of things. One,
stabilize organizations that have been around for a while and that
have proven themselves. The other piece of that big pot would be
money to pay artists.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is anybody doing this?
</P>
<P>
   A: It happened in Minneapolis. The McKnight Foundation decided
it was a priority, so that organizations like an Actor's Express,
instead of paying $250 a week, would be able to pay $1,000 a week.
So that an artist in Minneapolis has to think twice before they
move to New York or L.A. because the money's not better. That's a
rare, really innovative solution to a problem, but it could happen
here if the resources were available. A couple of wrong moves here,
and an organization can be out of business. Nobody in their right
mind would live their life that way. Most arts organizations in
this city operate without any kind of net, which is intensely
stressful and one of the highest reasons for burnout, I think.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Anything else?
</P>
<P>
   A: The other thing that needs to happen is a significant leader
at the highest level _ either politically or in the business
community _ has to decide that addressing the arts community's
issues are a priority. We haven't had anybody doing that since
Michael Lomax (former Fulton County Commission chairman, now
president of Dillard University in New Orleans). When I look at the
communities around the country that are doing a better job, it
without exception has been because of the leadership of a single
individual. Either a mayor or a CEO of one of the major
corporations. It's happened in Charlotte, of all places, which is
giving about four or five times as much as Atlanta is to the arts.
And it's because a leader, a single corporate leader (Hugh McColl,
chairman and chief executive of Bank of America) in that community
decided it was a high priority and wanted to make that city a
player.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you see anybody in Atlanta who can play that kind of
dynamic role?
</P>
<P>
   A: I know a little bit about Carl Ware at Coca-Cola; I think he
could play that role. I think Shirley Franklin (an aide to former
Atlanta Mayors Maynard Jackson and Andrew Young), if she's elected
mayor _ and everybody in the business community is saying she's
going to run _ could play that role brilliantly. If she would ever
get ... into politics and could run this state, Ingrid Saunders
Jones, vice president at Coca-Cola, could. (Atlanta City
Councilwoman) Cathy Woolard has an amazing career ahead of her in
this city. I don't know whether she's going to be president of the
City Council or she's going to be a congressperson, but I fully
expect there's a career there. I think she's somebody who totally
gets it and could play that leadership role.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where are the arts a priority?
</P>
<P>
   A: San Diego City Council last year allocated $9 million to the
arts. The city of Atlanta gives about $500,000 a year. Fulton
County gives about $2.5 million a year. Seattle has been a real
leader. Minneapolis has been really innovative. Philadelphia's arts
community was not that significant a couple years ago, and the Pew
Trust decided they had to do something. They started creating
grants for individual artists, which nobody else was doing. Those
are some of the places that are comparable-sized cities that are
doing a better job than Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who are big dogs now in Atlanta besides the Alliance,
theater-wise?
</P>
<P>
   A: There aren't any. It's one of the things that makes it
difficult for Atlanta to be a viable place for an artist, an actor
or a designer to stay here for a long time. You've got the
Alliance, which is $10 million (budget-wise). The next largest
theater, I believe, is Theatre in the Square, which is about $1.5
million. In Seattle, you've got Seattle Rep, which is $8.5 million,
then next is A Contemporary Theatre, which is $5 million, then
you've got Intiman, which is $4 million. And all of those places
are playing actors $625 or $700 or $800 a week, which means that
there are three theaters where you can make enough to live on.
That's not the case here. The same is true in Chicago. The same is
true in San Diego. If this community is going to grow, one or two
of the organizations need to be looked at in a way that says, ``How
do we grow that organization so that we make it possible for
artists to stay here?''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is your single most joyous moment in your tenure in
Atlanta theater?
</P>
<P>
   A: We were doing the second show we ever did, ``The Good Woman
of Setzuan,'' in a church basement out on Clairmont Road. We had no
money. We were putting this Brecht show together. Nobody's getting
paid. And it was hell to open it because everybody had other jobs.
And then it got a great review, and then the second weekend we were
in the ``Best Bets'' thing (in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution) in
between ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone'' at the Alliance and ``Les
Miz'' at the Fox. And this was only our second show, and to be
recognized so early on was thrilling because we felt so anonymous,
deeply anonymous, and inferior.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was was your most frustrating moment?
</P>
<P>
   A: The level of funding we've received from the county and the
state. Because those funding pools have been static, there's been
no room for growth. So despite the fact that after about four or
five years, we were considered on a par, or more exciting maybe,
than some of our peers, budget-wise we remained way below most of
our peers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will the Express survive your exit?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a valid question. I absolutely do think the Express can
survive, and I think it's positioned to survive. The organization
started out as me, and it has become a lot bigger than me. There's
a very strong committed board, a very strong staff, and I think
there is real support for its future in the community. I think it's
all about selecting the right person. Our goal has not just been
about finding somebody who can take over the Express, but somebody
who can really contribute to the life of the community.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which other theater here does the most consistently good
work?
</P>
<P>
   A: I like Georgia Shakespeare Festival. I've seen some really
interesting stuff there. I like 7 Stages a lot. The other one I
like that you don't get to see that much of is Soul-stice
(Repertory). I'd rather go see a show there than most places in
town. Often the acting is really quite good.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How would you characterize Atlanta's support of the arts?
</P>
<P>
   A: On one hand I feel very fortunate that we've been able to do
what we've been able to do and that we've had the support we've
had, especially from individuals and our board. I think given the
resources that are available in this community, Atlanta is behind.
Funding for the arts in this city is behind what comparable cities
around the country are getting. There are a lot of resources that
are not tapped.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are they?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's a whole generation of people that are getting wealthy
on the Internet that have not been connected to the arts community.
I think there's a huge number of corporations who give nothing to
the arts, and I don't know why that is. There's not been a
mechanism set up that knows how to tap into them. In Seattle
there's a thing called the Corporate Council for the Arts that
specifically goes around and educates corporations about what they
can get out of it. And they solicit the money. They've made a huge
difference in the viability of arts organizations in that
community. That's a big job.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How would you characterize Atlanta's taste?
</P>
<P>
   A: My experience with Atlanta audiences is that they're great _
once you get them in the door. If you get them in the door, they're
very responsive and willing to take a chance on stuff that is more
complex than you think they will. They're smarter than people think
they are. There's a finite number who are a possible audience for
an arts event right now, and those people have a pretty decent
level of awareness and a pretty high sense of adventure. I think
there's a huge untapped market of people who don't even think about
the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What will you miss most about the city?
</P>
<P>
   A: Friends, people. The hardest thing about announcing this
transition has been longtime subscribers or longtime funders
telling me that they hate it that I'm leaving and how much the work
has meant to them. That's been kind of emotional and gratifying and
guilt-inducing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What will you miss the least?
</P>
<P>
   A: Traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's your response when you hear the words ``Atlanta'' and
``international city''?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we've got a long way to go. The things that aren't
just about making a buck are the places where we're not even on the
playing field yet. We could be. But it's going to take time, and
it's going to take some really innovative leadership.

 &HT;    Tutu, Gandhi offer views on forgiveness
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In Emory University's striking Cannon Chapel this
week, men with two of the world's best-known names in human rights,
Gandhi and Tutu, sat to talk about the critical importance of
forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The Gandhi is Rajmohan, grandson of Mahatma and a scholar in his
own right. The Tutu is South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a
Nobel peace laureate for his nonviolent work in ending apartheid,
who is serving as a visiting professor at the university.
</P>
<P>
   Each spoke about forgiveness from his own religious perspective,
Gandhi as a Hindu and Tutu as a Christian, to a standing-room-only
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The Mahabharata, an ancient Indian epic poem, relates many
incidents that seem to glorify revenge, Gandhi said. But his
grandfather interpreted the poem not as calling for revenge, but as
illustrating the cycle of violence when revenge is practiced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is essential for us Hindus to recognize and embrace the
concept of forgiveness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu began his presentation at the beginning of the Bible _ with
the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be said that this was God's intention for God's
creation, that all should live in harmony and peace,'' he said.
With sin, humans destroyed that harmony, Tutu said, and the rest of
the Bible is the story of how to restore the world to its previous
pristine, harmonious state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sin is fundamentally centrifugal,'' Tutu said. ``It pushes
things away from the center.''
</P>
<P>
   When humans are wronged, the archbishop said, they can respond
by exacting revenge, pretending nothing happened, or by forgiving
the perpetrator and working for true reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Gandhi and Tutu agreed that acknowledgment of wrong and justice
are necessary for true reconciliation _ a healed relationship
between enemies or victim and perpetrator. But a person should try
to forgive even if the other party never asks for it, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Gandhi confessed that in his own life he is prone to hold
grudges and pass blame. ``But if I don't forgive somebody who has
really hurt me, I'm the guy who continues to stay in a horrible
state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has learned to forgive, he said, ``for my own sanity and
health, and the future of those I care about _ for their sake, I
will ask God for the strength and ability to forgive.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgiveness, said Tutu, ``is not being altruistic. To forgive
is, in fact, the best form of self-interest.''
</P>

AUSTRIA COALITION IS SWORN IN AS DIPLOMATIC FALLOUT RISES
</HEADLINE>
   (With AUSTRIA-ASSESS, AUSTRIA-U.S.) 
(rk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ President Thomas Klestil swore in a coalition
government Friday that includes members of the anti-immigration
Freedom Party. That prompted the United States to recall its
ambassador ``for consultations'' and European governments to begin
downgrading relations in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said contacts with the
Austrian government would be limited, adding that there should be
no place in a European government for a party that ``doesn't
distance itself clearly from the atrocities of the Nazi era and the
politics of hate.''
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Freedom Party, Joerg Haider, has done just
that in recent days, calling the Nazi regime barbaric and signing a
document that commits the new government to work for an Austria
free of xenophobia and anti-Semitism. But his about-face after past
expressions of sympathy for aspects of Hitler's rule has not
convinced the West.
</P>
<P>
   At a tense ceremony in the Hofburg Palace, the icy manner and
averted gaze of Klestil conveyed all his personal distaste for the
intermittently hate-mongering politics of Haider's far-rightist
party as he took the oaths of office from the 12 Cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of demonstrators brandishing banners that denounced
Haider as a fascist clashed with the police outside, obliging the
ministers from the conservative People's Party and the Freedom
Party to use a tunnel to cross under the square that separates the
president's office from the chancellery.
</P>
<P>
   The subterranean debut, and the clamor in the habitually sedate
streets of the capital, seemed to sum up the looming isolation of
the coalition and the abrupt disquiet of a country better known for
consensus than conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Israel immediately withdrew its ambassador. Germany and Finland
said bilateral ministerial contacts had been frozen, and other
European Union countries promised to follow suit, honoring a
commitment made on Monday to shun ministerial-level contacts if
Haider's party entered the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are filled with concern for Europe,'' Foreign Minister
Joschka Fischer of Germany said, echoing the alarm of several
European countries whose real fear is not immediate upheaval, but
the prospect that the Austrian coalition could break the general
consensus that the moderate right in Europe should not ally with
the extreme right.
</P>
<P>
   Such alliances in countries like Germany or France would have a
shattering effect on the broad thrust of postwar politics,
threatening further moves toward European integration. But for now
those moves remain a remote possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The new government here is headed by Chancellor Wolfgang
Schuessel of the center-right People's Party. Schuessel's decision
to form a coalition's giving the sanction of high office to the
Freedom Party brought three decades of Social Democratic-led
government to an end and the wrath of the West down on Austria.
</P>
<P>
   The formation of the government was the first stage in what
could be a protracted battle between Austria and its 14 European
Union partners, who have in effect committed themselves to
undermining the coalition by isolating it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The European governments have placed themselves on a very high
horse, from which it will not be easy to descend,'' a British
foreign policy expert, Jonathan Eyal, said. ``Their unstated aim
now seems to be to bring the Austria government down. But what if
that merely makes Haider stronger?''
</P>
<P>
   The long-term effect of the European action appears difficult to
predict. The Austrian stock market fell 3 percent Friday, and
rumors of canceled investments and a downgrade of the country's
credit rating swirled here. It appears just possible that the
economy could suffer to a point where the government becomes
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Faced by a possibility of real damage to the country, Klestil
made an extraordinary televised appeal Friday, several hours after
swearing in the government. ``The People's Party and the Freedom
Party have a majority of seats in Parliament,'' he said, referring
to the two parties' 104 seats in the 183-member chamber. ``This
must be respected in a democracy. Therefore, the intention of the
two parties to form a coalition had to be accepted in a democratic
state based on the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the members of the federal government, I appeal to you to
act in the spirit of European values and to work with all your
strength so that Austria will find the kind of international
acceptance and recognition it deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   The European Union took the past words of Haider as a legitimate
basis to downgrade diplomatic relations, a step that the United
States has not taken. Still, the Clinton administration's
displeasure is clear enough. Defense Secretary William Cohen said
the new government ``might be a step back into a very dark past.''
</P>
<P>
   The past in question is the Third Reich, enthusiastically
embraced by many Austrians in 1938 and occasionally defended by
Haider in references to Hitler's labor policies and his Waffen SS.
</P>
<P>
   Haider has since tried to take back those remarks and, in a
declaration signed this week with Schuessel, committed himself to
``understanding for all human beings irrespective of their
origin.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview Friday with German television, Haider
appeared to cast scorn on the document. ``It is an affront for the
Austrian public that such matters of course have to be signed time
and again,'' Haider said. ``I have no intention of wandering around
the world apologizing for all kinds of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Haider has chosen not to join the government and stay on as
governor of the southern province of Carinthia. But there is little
doubt that his influence will be strong.
</P>
<P>
   Many Austrians, tired of the Social Democrats and worried by
rising immigration, embraced his message, pushing his party's share
of the vote from 5 percent in 1983 to 28 percent in elections in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Foreign Minister Benita Ferrero-Waldner, a member of the
People's Party, said that she would tell the European Union that it
had overreacted. ``Joerg Haider has made mistakes,''
Ferrero-Waldner said. ``But he has also distanced himself from his
mistakes, and he is not in the government.''

GLOBALIZATION: IF YOU CAN'T BEAT IT, RESHAPE IT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With security agents toting submachine guns, army helicopters
buzzing overhead and protesters breaking windows in yet another
McDonald's, Davos man, the elite agent of global capitalism, is
under siege.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to reach that conclusion after attending this
year's session of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland,
where government officials, chief executives, and leading
economists gathered to schmooze and ponder globalization under
heavy guard.
</P>
<P>
   The road to the Alpine resort was icy, and the confidence of the
power brokers there seemed to be slipping. Since the disastrous
global trade talks in Seattle not long ago, many of those who have
long favored closer integration between nations are on the
defensive.
</P>
<P>
   But it's probably a mistake to think that globalization itself
is threatened. On the contrary, the unions and environmental groups
that assail the World Trade Organization seem on the whole to
prefer that nations become more like one another faster _ and in a
greater variety of ways. They are not so much trying to block
globalization as to hitch a ride.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of groups are seeking to influence the Davos crowd in
the service of causes from protection of sea turtles to elimination
of child labor. They do not speak with a single voice. But their
pleas no longer fall on deaf ears.
</P>
<P>
   The human rights group Amnesty International, the environmental
action organization Greenpeace and the AFL-CIO were all invited to
Davos this year, and they pushed similar agendas. Globalization
cannot really be resisted, they said, but neither should it be
limited to commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Globalization is happening one way or another and it can't be
stopped,'' said John J. Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, ``but it
must be made to work for workers.'' Beyond going slow with new
trade agreements to protect union jobs in the developed world, that
means compelling poor countries to rewrite their labor laws to
conform more closely with those of rich countries _ in effect,
globalizing labor standards.
</P>
<P>
   Groups like Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund are taking a
similar tack. They want the WTO to inject some environmental
horse-trading into trade talks _ say, freer imports of Third World
textiles in exchange for stricter limits on logging in rain
forests.
</P>
<P>
   That some protest groups accept globalization _ albeit on their
own terms _ helps explain why President Clinton, whose free-trade
credentials are well established, extended an olive branch to those
who led the Seattle demonstrations. In Davos, Clinton embraced the
``new forces'' that demand a say in how nations relate to one
another, effectively offering them a seat at the negotiating table.
And he agreed with them that defining globalization merely in trade
terms is no longer enough; instead, the world should start talking
about the globalization of society.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot isolate economics as distinct from the environment
and labor,'' said Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade
representative. ``That's a distinction that's artificial.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea struck a responsive chord with the executives at Davos.
In fact, this year's conference may be remembered as the time
businesses and advocacy groups stopped fighting each other and
started talking.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders proposed a flurry of ways they could become
more socially conscious. Louis Schweitzer of Renault, for example,
suggested restricting political contributions by multinationals, to
restore faith that public policy is not beholden to corporate
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto was another company welcoming a ``new dialogue'' with
its adversaries. ``Companies need to understand what society's
expectations are and be ready to change a strategy if it does not
meet this test,'' said Nick E. Rosa, senior vice president. The
company has overhauled the way it uses genetics to modify crops,
largely in response to pressure from Greenpeace and other
environmental groups, Rosa said.
</P>
<P>
   The big problem with all this coziness is that poorer countries
like Mexico, South Africa, India and China _ the ones that would
have to do all the changing and harmonizing to suit rich-country
standards _ are balking at this expanded view of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most developing countries have a knee-jerk reaction to this _
they are not ready to discuss it,'' said Supachai Panitchpakdi, a
deputy premier of Thailand, who is due to take over the leadership
of the World Trade Organization in 2002. ``I'm afraid we won't see
much progress on trade right away.''
</P>
<P>
   That prediction remains to be tested. The Clinton administration
is still hoping to kick-start a new round of global trade talks
before its term expires. And if Davos was any indication,
globalization in the broadest sense is just getting started.

   For Indie Films, It's Get Thee Behind Me, Blockbuster &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quentin Tarantino once called Blockbuster Inc. ``the Great
Satan,'' poised to annihilate the country's mom-and-pop video
stores and the independent films they often carried. But now, Dean
Wilson, the chief merchandising officer of Blockbuster, is eager to
be the independent film industry's champion.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, 41, has snapped up more than 70 indies at film festivals
since January 1999. At the Sundance Film Festival, which ended last
Sunday, he added three more: ``Shadow Hours,'' ``Love and Sex'' and
``The Opportunist.''
</P>
<P>
   The deals are all part of Blockbuster Exclusives, the
acquisitions program he started a year ago to feed new films to his
more than 4,000 American stores and to the Sundance cable channel.
The latest three films will most likely start in the theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, not stopping there, has just agreed to finance a new
film from Fred Williamson, the former professional football player
and now an actor and producer. ``We're not trying to out-studio the
studios,'' Wilson said. ``We just love film and want to support
it.''
</P>
<P>
   A major competitor, Hollywood Films, has added offerings from
first-time filmmakers in 750 of its 1,600 video stores.
</P>
<P>
   At Sundance, Wilson's presence was all the more welcome because
Harvey Weinstein, the chairman of Miramax and usually the biggest
buyer of independent films there, was out sick. ``The great Satan
is now the great supporter of Sundance,'' said Peter McAlevey, the
producer of ``Shadow Hours.''

<P>
   Philip Guarascio, General Motors' vice president in charge of
advertising and corporate marketing, is home recovering from
triple-bypass surgery last Wednesday. Guarascio, 58, may not be a
household name, but in the advertising world, he looms larger than
a Chevrolet Suburban.
</P>
<P>
   He decides where GM spends its advertising dollars _ 2.1 billion
of them in the first three quarters of last year alone, more than
any other company.
</P>
<P>
   He is planning to be back at work in four to six weeks. ``They
expect a full recovery,'' said Terry Sullivan, a GM spokesman. Now
that the health concerns are assuaged, the question on everyone's
mind at the company is how Guarascio has maintained his
ever-fashionable appearance during his stay at the hospital and at
home. Maybe a more tailored version of the usual hospital garb:
``An Armani gown?'' Sullivan asked. &QL;

   A Poignant Case of a Patent &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is far from the longest or biggest patent suit on record, but
it must be among the most poignant. Frank Calabrese, 58, an
engineer in Waynesboro, Pa., who was too ill with cancer to attend
the trial, won a $13.2 million verdict late last month against the
French-owned Square D Co. for infringing on his patent for a data
system used in complex manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   The jury found Square D's action willful, which could triple the
award. Martin Hanna, a company spokesman, said Square D was
disappointed with the verdict and intended to appeal. He denied
accusations by the Calabrese team that the company tried to delay
the trial until Calabrese died.
</P>
<P>
   The case so touched the jury foreman that she wrote Calabrese
and his lawyers (Niro, Scavone, Haller &AMP; Niro of Chicago, which is
to get 40 percent of the final award or settlement) to praise their
work and to tell Calabrese that she was having prayers said for him
and his family at her church.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview last week, Calabrese said the verdict
had given him a huge lift. ``The doctors think I'm terminal,'' he
said. ``But you never know.''

   McMahon feels unappreciated on Wall Street, too. On Thursday,
when investors sold off his stock on his announcement of plans for
a new and unscripted football league, the XFL, he responded in
terms more appropriate for the wrestling ring than a family
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   But McMahon is no slouch in handling either investors or the
media. Besides raising $170 million last year in the initial public
offering, he attracted about 15 television cameras to his news
conference.

 &HT;    BellSouth to cut 2,100 jobs in effort to become `faster, more
agile'
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth Corp. on Friday announced plans to cut 2,100
jobs this year, the first time since the mid-1990s that the
Atlanta-based telecommunications company has acted to dramatically
trim its payroll.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth wants to eliminate barriers that divide various state
operations and other units, which means eliminating overlap in
areas such as human resources, financial, legal and regulatory
departments, said company spokesman Bill Getch.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, the company plans to keep growing in other
ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a faster, more agile BellSouth,'' Getch said.
``We will continue to grow our sales, marketing and services
organizations to meet customer needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The $25 billion-a-year company has reported rapid expansion in
wireless and international investments. While growth in its
nine-state region has slowed, demand for installation of new lines
remains strong.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth hopes to do the bulk of the job cuts without layoffs
by encouraging either early retirement or voluntary departure in
exchange for a severance package. Those packages will probably
mimic other such offerings, in which an employee receives a check
for 5 percent of his or her base pay for each year of service, up
to a full year's pay.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth hopes to complete the cuts by September, Getch said.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the announcement was strengthened by its timing.
The cuts delivered a symbolic blow to the psychology of an Atlanta
ascendant _ the third in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade-plus of dramatic growth in the Atlanta economy,
BellSouth's cuts follow on the heels of large-scale layoffs
announced at two other Atlanta corporate icons. At Lockheed Martin
there were cuts totalling 2,800, followed by Coca-Cola's stunning
announcement last week that 6,000 jobs would be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the first two, BellSouth is not slashing a
double-digit portion of its local work force. About 1,365 of
BellSouth's job cuts will be in metro Atlanta, where the company
has a work force of about 21,000. BellSouth will trim 420 jobs in
Birmingham, Ala., and 315 throughout the rest of its nine-state
region.
</P>
<P>
   The company said few of the targeted positions are union jobs.

BRANDS UNDER SEIGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few commercial developments of the past twenty years have been
more striking than the lionization of the Brand. At some point, the
old injunction to ``always differentiate your product'' was
buttressed by a new discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Bandwagon effects, demand externalities, winner-take-all: call
it what you like, the realization dawned that being tops in a given
market is disproportionately profitable compared to being number
two or three and that there was hardly any point at all to being
number four.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying economic logic is simple. The more people who use
your product, the more other people will be convinced it is the
best and want to use it too. Once your fixed cost is covered, each
additional unit you sell will be mostly gravy.
</P>
<P>
   Whereupon was unleashed a tsunami of marketing and advertising
aimed at convincing us that we were dealing with the leader: that
Taurus was more popular than Camry, that J. Crew was cooler than
the Gap, that Windows software was better, especially if it ran on
Pentium chips, and that we ourselves would be better if we wore
Polo or Tommy or Guess labels on our clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Such ``branding'' became a spectator sport last week, as Super
Bowl commercials touting new and unfamiliar Internet products
competed for attention with the football game.
</P>
<P>
   Now something of a backlash is building against the idea that a
relative handful of standards should prevail around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A is the dramatic decline in share prices over the last
year or so of great consumer product companies like Coca-Cola and
McDonald's. Sales are flat and prospects disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   So last month Coca-Cola announced that it would cut 20 percent
of its global workforce and dramatically scale back its targets for
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Facing similar problems, Procter &AMP; Gamble made overtures to
Gillette, Warner Lambert and American Home Products, in hopes of
buying additional revenues through merger. No soap.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Wall Street is nothing if not manic-depressive about the
concept of Brands. One year the big brands are said to be about to
take over the world and so are deserving of a multiple of 50 _
India! China! Globalization! The next, the world is said to have
lost interest in old-fashioned products _ after all, the downside
to having everyone buy your brand is that you lose snob appeal _
and so the companies command no better than a price 15 times
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   So Exhibit B is the evidence that a backlash against ``the
branded life'' may be setting in in the subtle political markets
where tastes ultimately are determined. I'm not thinking just about
the recent McDonald's-bashing demonstrations at the World Trade
Organization talks in Seattle and the World Econonomic Forum gala
in Davos. I have in mind Naomi Klein's new book, ``No Logo: Taking
Aim At the Brand Bullies.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein is a young Canadian journalist who has ranged widely among
the groups that appeared for the first time in the streets of
Seattle _ or rather for the first time in the front-page stories
about Seattle. She has written an attractive sprawl of a book
describing a vast confederacy of activist groups with a common
interest in reining-in the power of lawyering, marketing,
advertising and all the rest to manipulate our desires .
</P>
<P>
   ``When this resistance began taking shape in the mid-nineties,''
she writes, ``it seemed to be a collection of protectionists
getting together out of necessity to fight everything and anything
global. But as connections have formed across national lines, a
different agenda has taken hold, one that embraces globalization
but seeks to wrest it from the grasp of the multinationals.''
</P>
<P>
   Who are these groups? They include ethical shareholders,
culture-jammers (billboard and graffiti artists), street reclaimers
(pranksters who specialize in street theater), union organizers,
school-logo fighters (who resist the attempts of companies such as
Pepsi and Microsoft to lock up schools, put their name on uniforms
and such) and Internet corporate watchdogs.
</P>
<P>
   When she goes around the table, it sounds like one of those
scenes in James Bonds movie when the barons gather: The US-based
National Labor Committee and Campaign for Labor Rights; the Dutch
Clean Clothes Campaign; the Australian Fairwear Campaign; Hong
Kong's Asian Monitoring and Resource Center; the British Labour
Behind the Label Coalition and Christian Aid; the French Acir Ici
and Artisans du Monde; the German Werkstatt Okonomie; the Belgian
Les Magasins du Monde; and the Canadian Maquila Solidarity Network.
Conspicuously missing from the list: the AFL-CIO and other big
unions, whose agenda usually has more to do with feathering
membership's beds at the expense of the poor of other nations.
</P>
<P>
   The political sensibility that Klein describes so well is
probably powerless to halt a globalization whose forces are still
accelerating. But the movement is clearly able to influence
corporate behavior, this way and that, by concentrating its fire.
Just ask Nike. Or Royal Dutch Shell. And in its basic critique of
the psychopathology of logo-mania, it surely speaks for a wider
audience.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying those 6,000 Coca-Cola workers lost their jobs
because the company bought the right to bolt those 20-foot plastic
Coke bottles on the light stantions at Fenway Park. But I think it
had something to do with it.

CLIPPERS HIRE JOHNSON AS ASSISTANT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Proving, once again, that green is no prerequisite
for riding Boston history, the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday hired
former Celtics great Dennis Johnson to fill an assistant-coaching
vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 45, replaces Jim Todd, a native son of Massachusetts
who was hired Thursday to replace another ex-Celtics star, Chris
Ford, as the Clips' head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a great move,'' said Clipper power forward Maurice
Taylor of Johnson's hiring. ``Whatever he's got to tell me, I got
to listen to him. I mean ... he played with Larry Bird.''
</P>
<P>
   And how. While rolling with Bird and the Celtics, Johnson - a
product of Dominguez High -- took home NBA championship rings in
1984 and 1986. But he also grabbed a ring - and the Finals MVP
award -- in 1979 while wearing Seattle SuperSonics green.
</P>
<P>
   So why was he available?
</P>
<P>
   Because he's been coaching in the CBA, and the CBA is a farm
system for coaches as well as players. Johnson, the reigning CBA
Coach of the Month, steps away from his first season as head coach
of the LaCrosse Bobcats - who were 14-22 going into Friday's game
at Sioux Falls - to return to the NBA. He'll join the Clippers at
Staples Center for tonight's game vs. Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it might be good to get someone in here with more NBA
experience,'' Todd said of Johnson, who spent five years as a
Celtics assistant and received his first coaching job from ...
Ford. ``I only knew him through Chris. ''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who didn't play at Dominguez, cut his basketball chops
at Harbor College, then impressed NBA scouts while starring for
Pepperdine. His NBA tour included four seasons in Seattle, three in
Phoenix, seven in Boston and five trips to the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has played in the league for 14 years and he knows about
winning,'' Elgin Baylor, the Clippers' vice president of basketball
operations, said of Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   In Todd they trust: ``I feel bad for Chris Ford,'' said Taylor,
whose failure to report for Thursday's practice has been listed as
an absence excused for personal reasons. ``But the fit just wasn't
right. J.T. (Todd) is the kind of coach who let's you make
mistakes. He's going to open things up. We have a lot of young guys
and I think he'll allow us to play to our strengths.''
</P>
<P>
   The new coach believes he has evidence suggesting there are a
few positive traits.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we're concerned, we're 2-0,'' Todd said Friday at
Staples after conducting his first practice as the Clippers'
official interim head coach. ``The consensus is to build on those
two games.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``two'' refer to victories over Golden State and Sacramento
just before Christmas, 1999, a pair of slick performances
accomplished while Ford was home with a stiff back and Todd had the
captain's seat. Todd is steadfast in his gratitude toward Ford, who
gave him his first NBA job (Milwaukee). ``It's just a different
direction we're trying to take now.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be north.

THIS ELDER STATESMAN TOLD THEM SO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ At 82, the former prime minister still sits bolt
upright, his hands folded in his lap throughout an interview, and
the sphinxlike impression he gives, talking almost in a murmur for
nearly two hours, is only reinforced by his near absolute
stillness.
</P>
<P>
   Smiles occasionally play on the lips of Yasuhiro Nakasone,
nonetheless, relieving his overall austerity. And as his words make
clear, those flickers reflect the satisfaction of a man who senses
that long after his personal power has waned, his country is
finally catching up to him.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has had 24 prime ministers since the end of World War II,
and looking back, most Japanese would say that few of them have
left much of a mark. The ever direct Nakasone, who was prime
minister from 1982 to 1987, has never been one of the forgettable
ones.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after decades of public life ranging from his youthful,
ardent nationalism to nearly 20 years of persistent elder
statesmanship, the issues of constitutional reform and governance
that have driven him throughout his life have taken center stage in
Japanese politics more than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, when Japan's parliament opened for its first session
of the 2000s, constitutional reform was suddenly at the center of
the agenda. For years the issue was considered so controversial
that it was a guaranteed nonstarter.
</P>
<P>
   And to a remarkable degree, almost across the spectrum, the
major tenors of the country's political scene are voicing themes,
from more autonomy on defense matters to direct election of prime
ministers to decentralization, that Nakasone has preached _ often
in the desert _ for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had the experience of the last 50 years, and all of
the shortcomings or the defects of our constitution have become
visible,'' Naka-sone said in a private office near parliament,
where he still sits. ``Now, as we go into the 21st century, there
is a surging trend of wanting to review or revisit the structures
of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Nakasone has been urging a revision of the
constitution _ inherited from Japan's American occupiers in 1947 _
almost from the moment of its creation. To popularize the theme, as
a young member of parliament in 1956 he published a song about
changing the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, his image was that of something of a conservative
political bomb thrower. Even earlier in his career, Nakasone
aroused the irritation of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, the imperious
commander of occupation forces in Japan, by urging a swift
departure of the occupiers. Not achieving that goal, Nakasone
regularly wore black to parliament in symbolic mourning for his
country's lost independence.
</P>
<P>
   His style has long since mellowed, but the ideas driving the
demand for constitutional reform remain consistent with his past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have to change the language to real Japanese,'' he
said of the document, which to many Japanese reads very much like
something translated from a foreign language. More important, he
adds, starting with the preamble, ``there are very few factors
pertaining to autonomy, or independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other changes, Nakasone calls for the revision of Article
9, which states that the Japanese people ``forever renounce war as
a sovereign right'' and pledge that land, sea and air forces ``will
never be maintained.''
</P>
<P>
   Nakasone is vague on the details of what should come in its
place, calling for a ``new law on national security,'' but
continued strong security ties with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The values that are important in the world today must be
firmly adhered to,'' he hastened to add. ``For example democracy,
freedom, human rights, peace and international cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fact that a wide range of politicians have joined him
in a willingness to contemplate revision of the article, long the
biggest taboo in Japanese politics, in itself represents a sea
change in this country's affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Already, belying the spirit of the constitution, Japan's
Self-Defense Force commands the fourth-largest military budget in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have forces that are considered armed forces under
international law, we should admit that we have military forces,''
said Yukio Hatoyama, the leader of the Democratic Party, the main
rival of Nakasone's long-governing Liberal Democratic Party, in an
interview with the newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun.
</P>
<P>
   Nakasone's political hallmark has always been his energetically
forthright style. ``He is probably the most impressive prime
minister in postwar Japan since Prime Minister Yoshida, who held
office several times just after the war,'' said Gerald L. Curtis, a
political scientist at Columbia University, referring to Shigeru
Yoshida. ``He is unusual because he was always presidential in
style, seeing himself as a leader much the way people in the West
think of leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   It is clear from Nakasone's comments that he would like to see
his country more engaged with the world, much in the image of his
own first-name-basis diplomacy with Ronald Reagan. Japan, he said,
must become steadily more engaged with its neighbors. And given the
country's declining population, it must gradually open itself up to
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   In implicit but clear criticism of the recent crop of Japanese
prime ministers, he said the country's leaders must be more
forceful, more executive and more visible as real players on the
world stage.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing a means to achieve that, he returns to the subject
of political reform, saying direct election of prime ministers is
needed, rather than the current process in which horse-trading
politicians choose the country's leaders. In the future, he said,
Japan must also evolve toward a more stable system of two major
parties, one conservative, the other liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, though, he says with a distinct note of
self-satisfaction, there is sufficient scope for a prime minister
to lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, the prime minister under the constitution is quite
strong, perhaps akin to the presidency of the United States,''
Nakasone said. ``I pledged before becoming prime minister that I
would be more presidential. I said so, and I did so, too.''

RESEARCHER ADMITS HE FALSIFIED DATA ON BREAST CANCER TREATMENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DENISE GRADY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A South African researcher has admitted that he falsified data,
and is retracting a widely publicized study claiming that
bone-marrow transplantation and high-dose chemotherapy could
prolong the lives of women with advanced breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The admission of fraud came only after a team of American
scientists visited the researcher's laboratory last week to examine
his records, and found they did not match what he had reported.
</P>
<P>
   The researcher, Dr. Werner Bezwoda, of the University of
Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, presented his findings last May at a
major cancer conference held in Atlanta by the American Society of
Clinical Oncology. Of five studies discussed at that meeting, his
stood out as the only one to indicate that the arduous treatment
helped women.
</P>
<P>
   Bezwoda's results were widely reported and taken as a ray of
hope by many patients and advocates of high-dose treatment. Some
researchers were eager to try out his methods in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Bezwoda's findings differed so markedly from those of other
researchers that other scientists were immediately skeptical. Even
before the meeting in May was over, some were calling for an
independent group to travel to Johannesburg to examine his data
before scientists here tried to replicate his experiments.
</P>
<P>
   A group of American cancer experts did so last week. Bezwoda let
them see only part of his data, and they quickly found problems.
The scientists reported their findings to the university, which
began its own investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. P. Cleaton-Jones, chairman of the University of
Witwatersrand Committee for Research on Human Subjects, said in a
telephone interview that Bezwoda's study had compared two groups of
patients, an experimental group given the high-dose treatment and a
control group that was supposed to have been given a more
conventional treatment. Bezwoda reported that the high-dose group
had fared much better than the controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what he labeled as the control group was not accurate,''
Cleaton-Jones said. The control patients were given a completely
different treatment from what was stated in Bezwoda's reports.
Cleaton-Jones said that as far as he knew, no patients were harmed.
But, he said ``the comparison he made was not valid.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the study is worthless, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Durant, executive vice president of the oncology
society, said, ``It means you should just throw it out.''
</P>
<P>
   On February 3, the University of Witwaterwrand posted a press
release on its website, announcing the investigation of Bezwoda.
The release quoted a letter than Bezwoda had sent written to
colleagues on January 30, admitting that he had ``committed a
serious breach of scientific honesty and integrity'' and had
misrepresented his results. Bezwoda has resigned from his
university positions.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the university, Martha Molete, said bluntly
that Bezwoda had lied.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how Bezwoda was allowed to present bogus work at the
oncology society's most important conference, Durant said that the
group has rigorous scientific standards but essentially uses an
honor system, in which researchers submit summaries of their work
before the conference and assure the society that the research has
been reviewed and approved by human research monitors at their own
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we believe that's what everybody does, except this guy,''
Durant said. ``He misled us, he misled the public, he misled the
people who are being treated. I am very, very distressed, and very
angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Durant was not part of the investigating group, but he said
members told him that they had discovered that Bezwoda had
circumvented the board at his university that was supposed to
monitor human studies. ``He was conducting this trial sort of on
his own,'' Durant said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Breast Cancer Coalition, a patient's advocacy
group, issued a statement saying that the revelations from South
Africa confirm that there is not data to support the use of high
dose treatment and bone marrow transplantation in breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment has become one of the most contentious subjects in
breast cancer research, with some advocates saying it is the only
hope for women with advanced disease and others saying women should
not be subjected to its harsh side effects because it has not been
proved to lengthen their survival.
</P>
<P>
   But Durant said the final verdict was not yet in, because the
studies that have thus far shown no benefit are still going on, and
over time may show that the procedure helps some patients. Many
doctors, though, say that if no benefit has shown up by now, any
that does is likely to be extremely small.

U.S. JUDGE PUTS MCCAIN ON N.Y. BALLOT AND VOIDS GOP PETITION
RULES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the state's Republican leadership in retreat, a
federal judge made Sen. John McCain's victory over New York primary
system official Friday, placing him on the ballot and even adding
another candidate, Alan Keyes. The judge's order means that
Republicans in New York will for the first time in memory choose
from the same presidential contenders running in other states.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Edward R. Korman of U.S. District Court in Brooklyn,
also ruled that two requirements for circulating nominating
petitions were unconstitutional, seeking to hinder the state party
from disqualifying candidates other than the front-runners like
McCain in future primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's moves came in a court settlement reached a day after
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and his chief New York supporter, Gov.
George Pataki, dropped their attempt to use the state's tortuous
election rules to bar McCain from the March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
   The two governors hoped to limit the political damage from the
ballot fight, which McCain, who scored a startling win in the New
Hampshire primary, had turned into a potent symbol of his tilting
against the political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   In the court settlement, the Republican State Committee
acknowledged that the primary rules ``impose an undue burden on
access to the ballot.'' Until Friday, voters in some parts of the
state would have been able to select only between Bush and Steve
Forbes, the publisher, but the ballot across the state is now to
include the four contenders still in the race.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had tried to qualify across New York, but petition
challenges by the party had left him on the ballot in only 19 of
the state's 31 congressional districts. Pataki promised on Thursday
that McCain would be in the primary across the state, but McCain
and his lawyers said they wanted more than just a ballot spot,
demanding that some of the rules be repealed.
</P>
<P>
   In talks Friday to settle a lawsuit brought by McCain against
the primary system, party lawyers then pledged not to appeal the
judge's decision to overturn the two petition requirements.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``After a long struggle, I am now confident that I can win the
state of New York,'' McCain said in a statement. ``I am glad there
will not be a repetition of the kind of machine-style political
control of the process of selecting the nominee of our party.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the 2004 primary will be starkly different is unclear,
because the governor and the Legislature adopt the rules every four
years. But the publicity surrounding the ballot fight and the
judge's ruling and repeated criticism suggest that the Republicans
might be ready to overhaul a system that has long given the party
favorite many advantages.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic system in New York has less onerous requirements,
though it is still tougher than that of many other states. Both
major contenders this year, Vice President Al Gore and former Sen.
Bill Bradley, qualified statewide.
</P>
<P>
   In most of the country, widely recognized candidates like McCain
have to spent little or no resources qualifying for primaries. In
New York, McCain spent nearly $200,000 to get on the ballot in 19
districts; Forbes spent nearly $700,000, his lawyers said this
week, to qualify statewide.
</P>
<P>
   The New York system is laden with requirements, but the two that
Korman overturned became touchstones in the debate over whether the
rules were unfair. Candidates qualify for the primary district by
district, and one of the requirements mandated that people who
circulate petitions in a district either be Republicans residing in
the district or notaries public.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates as a result were prohibited from sending groups of
volunteers across the state to collect signatures, and had to
establish organizations in all 31 districts. That was not a problem
for a party favorite like Bush, who was assisted in the petition
gathering by hundreds of party regulars on the local level. But it
proved a handicap for McCain, whose base was in Staten Island, home
of Guy Molinari, the borough president and his campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
   At hearings in the lawsuit, Korman called this rule ``bizarre.''
In his decision released Friday, he wrote that its purpose was ``to
disadvantage a candidate for president who does not enjoy the
support of the Republican State Committee.'' He noted that it
drastically reduced the pool of Republicans who could circulate
petitions from the 3.1 million in the state to the fraction living
in a congressional district.
</P>
<P>
   Korman also threw out another rule that he seemed to find just
as maddening. It required people who sign petitions to list their
town, rather than their village. Citing this technicality, local
Republicans on Long Island were able to disqualify thousands of
signatures on Forbes and McCain petitions. Long Island has a few
large towns made up of many villages, and most people use their
villages as their addresses.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush had the state party's help, he was actually thrown
off the ballot in a district in the South Bronx because petition
gatherers forged signatures. In his decision, Korman put Bush back
on the ballot in the district, apparently to insure that all four
candidates had the same chance.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Pataki appeared relieved Friday that the ballot battle
was over, and that they had taken away an issue from McCain. ``It
gave the McCain campaign the ability to talk about something that
is not of great significance to the average voter,'' said Zenia
Mucha, a spokeswoman for Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about future primaries, Mucha said the party would study
the judge's decision and ``see how we can address this to make it a
much fairer and better system.''
</P>
<P>
   John R. Cuti, a lawyer for McCain, said the party would have no
choice. He said the legal and public relations fallout from the
fight would reverberate into 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator McCain was not going to accept a deal that merely put
him on the ballot,'' said Cuti, a partner at the firm of Emery,
Cuti, Brinckerhoff &AMP; Abady. ``He wanted real reform and we got
it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Treasury bond market went haywire last week. What
exactly does the chaos in this huge and hugely significant market
mean to investors?
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil hit traders hardest at the nation's banks, brokerage
firms and hedge funds. Many of these players had bet _ accurately _
that the Federal Reserve Board would raise interest rates.
Normally, such a move would push up yields on both short-term and
long-term securities.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time. Even as the Fed voted to raise short-term rates
by one-quarter point, yields on long-term Treasuries declined, from
6.48 percent on Monday to 6.26 percent on Friday. Two-year Treasury
notes ended the week at 6.61 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't often that short-term rates are a good deal higher than
longer-term rates. And when it happens, it traditionally portends
an economic slowdown. That is in large part because financial
institutions _ which borrow at short-term rates and lend long _
have no incentive to make loans in such an environment. If credit
is tight, companies cannot finance their growth and economic output
declines.
</P>
<P>
   Almost nobody thinks that last week's bond market action is
pointing to a slowdown. Indeed, all the data point to a blazing
economy, which is why the Fed feels compelled to raise rates.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, traders say, the bond market is embroiled in a technical
move unrelated to economic fundamentals. Lower yields on long-term
bonds are a direct result, they say, of the Treasury's plan to both
reduce the amount of debt it will issue and to buy back many
existing bonds.
</P>
<P>
   With the Treasury focusing its aim on securities with 10- to
30-year durations, investors made a mad scramble to buy long-term
bonds ahead of a shortage.
</P>
<P>
   This widely held view worries Andrew S. Teufel, research
director at Fisher Investments Inc. in Woodside, Calif. While he
agrees that the Treasury refinancing plan is having a huge impact
on the bond market, he is troubled by the idea that everyone is
writing off the interest rate inversion as merely technical. He
wonders if the market is indeed trying to send investors a warning
_ one that is being ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sentiment gauge, and our early sense of it is that
people are dismissing it,'' he said. ``If everyone is paying
attention, it's innocuous. If no one is paying attention to it,
it's dangerous. If people are paying attention to it but writing it
off as not dangerous, then there is some danger, too.''
</P>
<P>
   It is too soon to tell whether the bond market is signaling a
slowdown. But the rise in short-term rates is hurting shares in
financial institutions, whose borrowing costs are increasing.
</P>
<P>
   Investors don't have to own bank stocks to feel their pain.
Shares of financial companies make up 13 percent of the value of
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the rally in long bonds winds up being solely related to
the reduced supply of Treasuries, investors should not expect
things to go back to normal anytime soon. Interest rate strategists
say that when the bond market undergoes a structural change, as it
is now, it takes months for investors to adjust fully to the
change. The adjustment may not be pretty.

BUSH ADS ATTACK MCCAIN BY NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN AND ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Seeking to invigorate his campaign in South
Carolina, Texas Governor George W. Bush Friday launched an
advertising blitz that attacks Arizona Senator John McCain by name
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday Bush is expected to meet with his senior campaign aides
in Austin, Texas, to discuss how to proceed in light of McCain's
rising popularity in South Carolina and nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials denied that the meeting was ``a major
summit,'' or that they were ``retooling'' Bush's message since his
lopsided defeat in New Hampshire Tuesday. But talk of McCain's
advance cannot be avoided, aides acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important conversation that follows what happened in
New Hampshire,'' said Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman. ``We have a
fight on our hands. All conversations about what we do and where we
go will be conducted with the full realization of the changing
political dynamic.''
</P>
<P>
   The new television ad in South Carolina comes as Bush took
repeated aim at McCain Friday during a swing in this early primary
state, accusing McCain of ``Washington double-talk'' for attacking
special interests while currying support and raising money from
lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   One new tack in the Bush campaign, however, was greeted coldly
Friday, when five US senators demanded that the Texas governor
apologize for comments Thursday by a veteran who endorsed Bush and
attacked McCain as someone who had ``always opposed all the
legislation'' intended to help veterans.
</P>
<P>
   A letter from the senators criticized Bush for allowing J.
Thomas Burch, chairman of the National Vietnam and Gulf War
Coalition, to ``impugn John McCain's character and so maliciously
distort his record'' the day before. The senators also urged Bush
to reject Burch's endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was initiated by Massachusets Democrat John F. Kerry,
and signed by McCain national co-chair, Nebraska Republican Chuck
Hagel, as well as Democrats Chuck Robb of Virginia, Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska, and Max Cleland of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Fleischer dismissed it as a ``distraction from
the main issue,'' and ``old news.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter also underscored the controversy surrounding Burch,
who flew to South Carolina this week to appear at the Bush event.
Burch, 57, who spent a year and a half in Vietnam, has waged an
array of largely ineffectual battles on veterans' issues and has
consistently opposed McCain, according to a Senate aide.
</P>
<P>
   Senate aides said the one-page letter was sent late Friday to
Bush, who was traveling from Michigan to his home in Austin. Asked
about Burch's comments at a press conference the day before, Bush
made it clear he thought highly of McCain's war record, but didn't
comment on the criticisms of McCain's votes in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's new television ad is an implicit admission that McCain
has successfully framed the discussion about the budget surplus.
McCain talks about cutting taxes, protecting Social Security, and
paying down the national debt. Bush, on the other hand, has talked
almost exclusively about cutting taxes. On the stump and in his own
television commercial, McCain repeatedly criticizes Bush for
spending ``every dime'' of the federal surplus on tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain's ad about Governor Bush's tax plan isn't true and
McCain knows it,'' the Bush commercial says. ``McCain's economic
adviser says he'd support Bush's plan _ $2 trillion to protect
Social Security, pay down debt, and a real tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said the advertisement is proof of the governor's
competitive spirit, and said that after a weekend of rest, Bush
would come out charging against McCain on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows Governor Bush is going to fight back,'' said
Fleischer. ``He's got the fire in the belly and he won't allow
misrepresentations to take root.''
</P>
<P>
   But aides said Bush will stick with his message of compassionate
conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the lessons of New Hampshire is that the governor
realizes he must more vigorously promote his agenda,'' said
Fleischer. ``Whether it's the Union Leader, Steve Forbes, John
McCain or Al Gore, he needs to set the record straight.''

 &HT;    BellSouth job cuts to help company keep up with telecom industry
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth Corp.'s job cuts could accomplish several
tasks _ while playing to different constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   The company's decision to ``streamline'' _ that is, to cut its
work force by 2,100 jobs _ is meant to make BellSouth more popular
with customers and investors, while reassuring a large part of the
work force that the company will keep growing.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth executives were not available for comment Friday. But
company spokespersons stressed the need for more _ not fewer _
technicians, marketers, sales staff and employees providing
customer service.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth hopes layoffs will not be needed. Based on the
company's normal rate of attrition, enough jobs might be shed
without forced departures. Last year, for instance, 11,364
BellSouth employees left the company _ 9,341 through retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Sales have been booming in wireless and international units,
while remaining strong in its local service business. Yet
simultaneously, BellSouth has felt pressured to reshape itself and
keep cutting costs _ despite the continued surge of earnings to
all-time highs.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth insists it is not shrinking again as it did throughout
the 1990s. Instead, cuts will come in some office jobs _ human
resources, legal, financial, regulatory groups _ while expansion
continues elsewhere, said BellSouth spokesman Bill Getch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really about coordinating the sales and marketing so
we can package products, so we are going to grow those staff
functions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts come against a backdrop of radical change in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth can trace its roots back to 1881 and its founding as
Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph. After being absorbed into
the national Bell system, it was administered as a regional
monopoly by its holding company, AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   After becoming newly independent in the 1984 breakup of the Bell
system, it retained its monopoly status until the mid-1990s. In
1995, Georgia moved to permit competition in local service, a shift
echoed by other states. The following year, the Telecommunications
Act changed national ground rules, setting the stage for
competition in all markets.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth now is required to win approval from the Federal
Communications Commission to offer long-distance in its region. The
FCC pledged not to permit that entry until BellSouth can prove it
has opened its own local markets to competition. So far, the FCC
has turned back three BellSouth requests for long-distance, while
Bell Atlantic has become the first _ so far, the only _ regional
Bell to win approval, and only for New York.
</P>
<P>
   While BellSouth surely does remain dominant in its region and
has not persuaded regulators that its markets are truly
competitive, there is no question that it has competition. In metro
Atlanta alone, more than a dozen ambitious companies are competing
with BellSouth _ nearly all aimed at the business market. Targeting
consumers are MediaOne, with its upgraded cable lines, and MGC
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Entangled in those changes are technologies that permit voice to
be digitized and transmitted via the same wires _ or wireless
signals _ that carry data and video programs. That shift means that
phone companies can find themselves competing against broadcasters,
cable companies, Internet providers and entertainment companies as
well.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has reacted. The company provides wireless television
service in Atlanta and several other cities. It has launched
high-speed Internet access using technology known as digital
subscriber lines _ DSL _ in addition to an aggressive Internet
unit.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's wireless unit is generally believed to hold the
largest market share in many of the South's largest cities, while
its International business now provides about one-third of the
company's $25 billion in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Yet amid the sweet sounds of growth and swelling profits,
BellSouth hears the rumbling steps of distant giants.
</P>
<P>
   A series of mergers have turned BellSouth from the largest of
seven regional Bells to the second-smallest of four. From being
dwarfed in telecom only by AT&AMP;T, BellSouth now also stands in the
shadow of MCI WorldCom, Bell Atlantic and SBC _ all of them bulked
up by acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, BellSouth has bought 10 percent of Qwest
Communications and a similar piece of a small New York consulting
company. In its one bid for a blockbuster deal _ a last-minute bid
for Sprint _ BellSouth was muscled aside by MCI WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   While praising BellSouth as well-run and consistently
profitable, some analysts have suggested that the company is no
longer in the top tier of the telecom industry. Instead, they have
warned that size and breadth are key to survival for all but niche
players.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth stock has paralleled that analysis, trading in a
narrow range throughout 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts announced Friday are aimed at giving the company
more focus, as well as cutting costs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their own operational logic, the job cuts
announced Friday send a message to Wall Street that BellSouth is
serious about fundamentals, about profits and about surviving.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, the move drew the embrace of investors and
sparked the hope of an upward surge. And a higher stock price comes
with various bonuses. For one, BellSouth could become decidedly
more costly for any potential hostile acquisitor. Company stock
closed Friday with a total value of about $85 billion _ too much
for all but the biggest players to gobble.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, BellSouth also would have a more potent currency to
do its own buying.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the cuts just continue a process of
centralization.
</P>
<P>
   The company was born as a holding company which oversaw
Southcentral Bell and Southern Bell, companies that covered the
nine states of the Southeast. In turn, those two operations had
units in each of their states.
</P>
<P>
   The two sub-Bells were consolidated several years ago, but
BellSouth still has units in the states and parallel operations for
many services, from local phone to Internet and entertainment. But
the company doesn't want customers to be forced to wander from unit
to unit in putting together a package of telecommunications
services.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts tend to see the cuts as necessary to the company's
continued health.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth at its height in the late 1980s had about 103,000
employees. By 1996, the company had been pared down nearly to
81,000. Yet in the past few years, the work force had been swelling
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``BellSouth has gone from being the least efficient of the
regional Bells in 1984 to being the most efficient of the Bells
today,'' said Rex G. Mitchell, analyst with Banc America
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is cuts like this that allow them to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   And all through its life, BellSouth has reported rising revenues
and earnings. Reflecting that growth _ and the confidence of
investors _ BellSouth's stock value appreciated at a double-digit
pace, year after year.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1999, stock performance was wan even as many Internet and
wireless companies saw shares rocketing skyward. Then, in October,
BellSouth made an eleventh-hour _ and ultimately failed _ effort to
outbid MCI WorldCom for Sprint. When BellSouth threw $100 billion
on the table, it signaled to many on Wall Street that the company
feared it could not survive without both size and a national
presence.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth stock, once trading at a relative premium to other
phone stocks, fell into the middle of the pack and stayed there.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, BellSouth's top brass meet with analysts in New York
City. However, that conference had no bearing on the timing of
today's announcement, Getch said.
</P>
<P>
   Previous meetings have produced at least a short-term surge in
the stock price, and Friday's boost of the stock might be partly
based on that expectation, Mitchell said. ``When they tell their
story, analysts like it. I think the further they get from that
Sprint bid, the better off they will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell shrugged off the common view that BellSouth will be
crushed by the emerging ``mega-carriers'' like Bell Atlantic, SBC,
MCI WorldCom and AT&AMP;T. Instead, the company's three-legged strategy
_ phone service in the Southeast, wireless and International
investments _ can work even if BellSouth is not a national player,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The most critical obstacle is BellSouth's continued inability to
win approval to provide long-distance in its region, Mitchell said.
``The most important thing for telecommunications of the future is
to offer a complete package of service to whoever your customers
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Coca-Cola or Lockheed Martin _ which have both announced
dramatic job cuts in recent weeks _ BellSouth doesn't seem to be a
company in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke shocked Atlanta _ that was a seismic shift, and this is
just a tweaking in comparison,'' said telecommunications analyst
Jeffrey Kagan. ``It's just realigning their strengths.''
</P>
<P>
   Reactions on Wall Street seem to bear out that notion.
Coca-Cola's stock dropped. BellSouth shares rose. Coca-Cola's cuts
were so dramatic, so wrenching and unexpected, that analysts and
investors were shaken into wondering whether the company had lost
its way, said David Burks, analyst with Hilliard, Lyons. ``This is
a more measured response.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether layoffs will be needed at all depends on
whether those who want to go are working in the areas that
BellSouth wants cut. If they don't, BellSouth will send them
packing. But whether voluntary or not, those who go will get the
same severance package, said spokesman Jeff Battcher.
</P>
<P>
   The company will take a charge of between $60 million and $80
million during the current quarter to pay for the cuts.

   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ Major Cornel Young Sr. buried his head in his
hands Friday, rubbed the red-rimmed eyes that reflect a week of
sleepless nights, and said slowly that he is searching for the
power to face each day.
</P>
<P>
   Young, the highest-ranking black officer on the Providence
police force, remains shattered by the death of his son and
namesake, Sergeant Cornel Young Jr., who died in a burst of gunfire
Jan. 28 from fellow officers who apparently mistook him for a
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to find the strength,'' said Young, seated at his
dining-room table as family and friends comforted each other a few
feet away. ``We haven't had a moment's rest since this incident
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   And when all the investigations are done, when all the official
conclusions have been reached, Young said, he might not return to
the force he has been proud to serve for a quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   Young spoke shortly after returning from a meeting with Colonel
Urbano Prignano Jr., the city's police chief. The major was briefed
on the investigation and shown witness statements about the
``chaos'' in which his son was mortally wounded outside an
all-night restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Several black clergy and many minority activists have denounced
the shooting as a fatal result of racial profiling, the practice of
assigning greater criminal suspicion because of race. But Young
chose his words carefully when asked if he believes race played a
role in his son's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department is doing everything it can to stop racial
profiling. But has it stopped yet _ no,'' Young said. ``I'm sure
there are racial problems within the department, but there are not
any more or any less'' than in many other police departments across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he ``will not speculate'' on what occurred outside
the restaurant. He does not know the officers involved, Young said,
and rejected their third-party request to attend his son's funeral
``as not appropriate at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   The major said he wished to avoid any potential disturbance at
the church. Concerning the officers, who have been placed on paid
leave, Young said that ``I'm sure they have to make hard decisions
themselves'' about whether they will return to the force if
cleared.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he has confidence in the department's probe
of the shooting, Young paused slightly before answering that he has
``confidence in the investigative process,'' placing emphasis on
the final word.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a police officer, so I have to have faith in my police
department,'' Young said. ``The chief has given me the witness
statements. You can't ask for much more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, however, said he would welcome a separate federal probe
by the FBI or Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how you do a puzzle?'' Young asked. ``You work the
frame of the puzzle first, and then when you work inside to the
center, you can see the whole picture. I think we're still building
the frame of the puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said he does not want assistance from outside groups that
do not have professional expertise in evidence gathering or
criminal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want'' help from organizations ``that are just
stirring the pot,'' Young said. ``I don't want this to cause
conflict and separate the city of Providence. I don't want Cornel's
name trashed by rumor and innuendo'' about the motivations of the
officers who shot him.
</P>
<P>
   The major said he does not agree with demands, advanced by the
Ministers' Alliance of Rhode Island and the Urban League, that the
officers be fired at this time. Although Young said he is grateful
for the support he has received from those organizations, he
stressed that the investigation must run its course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want this to be a racial issue, if that's not what it
is,'' Young said. ``If so, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   The important issue now is to prevent police officers out of
uniform _ whether black or white _ from being shot, Young said.
``We have to investigate how this happened, why it happened, and
make sure it doesn't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said he disagreed with the decision by police to disclose
witness information to news organizations. Perhaps casting doubt on
police statements that his son did not identify himself as an
officer, Young said that the actual statements he read Friday gave
``conflicting'' accounts of what happened when Officers Carlos A.
Saraiva and Michael Solitro III responded to a wild fight outside
Fidas Restaurant during which Aldrin Diaz allegedly was waving a
.22-caliber pistol.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was total chaos at that scene,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   The major's son had been waiting for a takeout sandwich at 1:30
a.m. when a brawl erupted inside the restaurant and spilled into
the parking lot. When Young saw his fellow officers confronting
Diaz, witnesses said, he pulled his service pistol and rushed
outside, where authorities say he trained his gun on Diaz and
closed to within five feet of the suspect before being struck by
three bullets fired by police.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say Saraiva and Solitro shouted at Young several
times to drop his weapon. Police have not identified the race of
the officers. Sources have said Solitro is white, and Saraiva has
been described as Latino by Mayor Vincent A. Cianci Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 468 police in the department,'' Young said. ``There
are going to be problems, of course. There are going to be issues
between blacks and whites, even between Italians and Irish.''
</P>
<P>
   These problems, he said, arise out of mistrust between groups
that do not understand ``each other's culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said that the department ``has lost a fine police officer.
I know he was already an asset to the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the shooting, Young said, Prignano had approved
his son's transfer to the community policing division that his
father supervises. ``He was very proud to follow in his father's
footsteps,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   As the Young family grieves, activists continue to plan protests
about the shooting. Demonstrators are expected to protest next
Friday outside Providence District Court during the arraignment of
Diaz on felony murder and gun charges.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have held Diaz responsible for the death of Young,
even though he dropped his weapon before the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those in power want to frame Aldrin Diaz for murder, not the
racist cops,'' said John Osmand, an organizer for The Campaign
Against Wrongful Convictions, a grassroots organization based in
Providence. ``This is wrong, and we intend to fight the charges.''

FELLOW VIETNAM VETERANS IN SENATE LEAP TO MCCAIN'S DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE, S.C. _ Gov. George W. Bush was slammed Friday by the
five senators who, besides his chief rival, Sen. John McCain,
fought in Vietnam for using a veterans activist to criticize
McCain's record on veterans issues.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday Bush shared a stage in Sumter with J. Thomas Burch
Jr., chairman of the National Vietnam and Gulf War Veterans
Committee, who said McCain, hailed as a hero for surviving five
years in a North Vietnamese prison camp, had opposed measures
dealing with Agent Orange and the Gulf War syndrome as well as
legislation to help families of soldiers missing in action in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter to Bush, the senators said, ``We are writing to
express our dismay at the misinformed accusations leveled by your
surrogate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These allegations are absolutely false,'' said the letter,
which was signed by Sens. Max Cleland of Georgia, Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska, John Kerry of Massachusetts and Charles Robb of Virginia,
all Democrats, and Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, a Republican and one of
McCain's few supporters in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed,'' it went on, ``Mr. Burch was a leading critic of
President Reagan's and your father's policies on POW/MIA issues,
and he vehemently opposed a historic effort led by the Senate
Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs carried out on a bipartisan
basis which resulted in the declassification of millions of
documents and the identification and return to the United States of
the remains of hundreds of American servicemen who were missing in
action.''
</P>
<P>
   The senators wrote that McCain was a leader on veterans issues
and added, ``We hope you will publicly disassociate yourself from
these efforts, and apologize to Senator McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the senators, McCain said, ``Their friendship is
all the honor I need in my life, and more than compensates for the
temporary irritation of baseless attacks by apparently desperate
political campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward T. Timperlake, who was assistant secretary of veterans
affairs under Bush's father, President George Bush, also said the
criticism of McCain was undeserved.
</P>
<P>
   Timperlake, who is supporting Bush, said that McCain has a good
record on veterans affairs and that ``attacking John McCain on
veterans' affairs is just wrong. It's over the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in South Carolina Friday, McCain drew crowds so huge
that organizers have been searching out bigger venues.
</P>
<P>
   At a medieval theme restaurant in Myrtle Beach Friday morning,
well over a thousand people packed every inch of floor, stair and
hallway space, even spilling out the front door.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, a crowd squeezed into a National Guard armory
here, where a sign on the front door read: ``Occupancy by more than
720 persons is dangerous and unlawful.'' The audience was pushing
the limit but everybody's attention was on the nearby table of
McCain stickers, posters, pamphlets and contribution forms, all of
which were moving briskly.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the aura of excitement, McCain is warning his backers
against overconfidence, noting that polls, and a campaign's
fortunes, can sway dramatically from one moment to the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been involved in too many campaigns to have any degree of
confidence here,'' McCain said aboard his campaign bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased we're doing well at this particular time. We've
seen a huge swing _ 20 points or more in South Carolina. I think
the message there is that it can swing back just as easily.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he is seeking to assemble the same type of coalition
that had propelled Ronald Reagan to the presidency, a broad-based,
centrist approach he said President Clinton had also successfully
employed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can win with hard-core conservatives but I would be
honored to have independents as well as Reagan Democrats,'' he
said, indicating he would accept the backing of the Reform Party as
well but would not change his message to win it.
</P>
<P>
   He said he welcomes ``libertarians, vegetarians, all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   After Bush suggested Friday that McCain was using his
chairmanship of the Senate commerce committee for political
advantage, McCain responded that his main rival was showing ``a
little sign of desperation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why doesn't George Bush explain his positions on the issues?''
McCain said, clearly relishing the notion, for now, of being the
candidate to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got the megaphone now,'' he said. ``The challenge for me
is to keep the momentum going.''

BRANDS UNDER SEIGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, February 6, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few commercial developments of the past twenty years have been
more striking than the lionization of the Brand. At some point, the
old injunction to ``always differentiate your product'' was
buttressed by a new discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Bandwagon effects, demand externalities, winner-take-all: call
it what you like, the realization dawned that being tops in a given
market is disproportionately profitable compared to being number
two or three and that there was hardly any point at all to being
number four.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying economic logic is simple. The more people who use
your product, the more other people will be convinced it is the
best and want to use it too. Once your fixed cost is covered, each
additional unit you sell will be mostly gravy.
</P>
<P>
   Whereupon was unleashed a tsunami of marketing and advertising
aimed at convincing us that we were dealing with the leader: that
Taurus was more popular than Camry, that J. Crew was cooler than
the Gap, that Windows software was better, especially if it ran on
Pentium chips, and that we ourselves would be better if we wore
Polo or Tommy or Guess labels on our clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Such ``branding'' became a spectator sport last week, as Super
Bowl commercials touting new and unfamiliar Internet products
competed for attention with the football game.
</P>
<P>
   Now something of a backlash is building against the idea that a
relative handful of standards should prevail around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A is the dramatic decline in share prices over the last
year or so of great consumer product companies like Coca-Cola and
McDonald's. Sales are flat and prospects disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   So last month Coca-Cola announced that it would cut 20 percent
of its global workforce and dramatically scale back its targets for
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Facing similar problems, Procter &AMP; Gamble made overtures to
Gillette, Warner Lambert and American Home Products, in hopes of
buying additional revenues through merger. No soap.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Wall Street is nothing if not manic-depressive about the
concept of Brands. One year the big brands are said to be about to
take over the world and so are deserving of a multiple of 50 _
India! China! Globalization! The next, the world is said to have
lost interest in old-fashioned products _ after all, the downside
to having everyone buy your brand is that you lose snob appeal _
and so the companies command no better than a price 15 times
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   So Exhibit B is the evidence that a backlash against ``the
branded life'' may be setting in in the subtle political markets
where tastes ultimately are determined. I'm not thinking just about
the recent McDonald's-bashing demonstrations at the World Trade
Organization talks in Seattle and the World Econonomic Forum gala
in Davos. I have in mind Naomi Klein's new book, ``No Logo: Taking
Aim At the Brand Bullies.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein is a young Canadian journalist who has ranged widely among
the groups that appeared for the first time in the streets of
Seattle _ or rather for the first time in the front-page stories
about Seattle. She has written an attractive sprawl of a book
describing a vast confederacy of activist groups with a common
interest in reining-in the power of lawyering, marketing,
advertising and all the rest to manipulate our desires .
</P>
<P>
   ``When this resistance began taking shape in the mid-nineties,''
she writes, ``it seemed to be a collection of protectionists
getting together out of necessity to fight everything and anything
global. But as connections have formed across national lines, a
different agenda has taken hold, one that embraces globalization
but seeks to wrest it from the grasp of the multinationals.''
</P>
<P>
   Who are these groups? They include ethical shareholders,
culture-jammers (billboard and graffiti artists), street reclaimers
(pranksters who specialize in street theater), union organizers,
school-logo fighters (who resist the attempts of companies such as
Pepsi and Microsoft to lock up schools, put their name on uniforms
and such) and Internet corporate watchdogs.
</P>
<P>
   When she goes around the table, it sounds like one of those
scenes in James Bonds movie when the barons gather: The US-based
National Labor Committee and Campaign for Labor Rights; the Dutch
Clean Clothes Campaign; the Australian Fairwear Campaign; Hong
Kong's Asian Monitoring and Resource Center; the British Labour
Behind the Label Coalition and Christian Aid; the French Acir Ici
and Artisans du Monde; the German Werkstatt Okonomie; the Belgian
Les Magasins du Monde; and the Canadian Maquila Solidarity Network.
Conspicuously missing from the list: the AFL-CIO and other big
unions, whose agenda usually has more to do with feathering
membership's beds at the expense of the poor of other nations.
</P>
<P>
   The political sensibility that Klein describes so well is
probably powerless to halt a globalization whose forces are still
accelerating. But the movement is clearly able to influence
corporate behavior, this way and that, by concentrating its fire.
Just ask Nike. Or Royal Dutch Shell. And in its basic critique of
the psychopathology of logo-mania, it surely speaks for a wider
audience.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying those 6,000 Coca-Cola workers lost their jobs
because the company bought the right to bolt those 20-foot plastic
Coke bottles on the light stantions at Fenway Park. But I think it
had something to do with it.

BELIEVING IN THE FUTURE OF AMAZON  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Questions may be italicized) 
(af) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's probably a stretch for most people to imagine that the
former Mets relief pitcher Tug McGraw and Jeff Bezos have much in
common. But they do.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, McGraw's ``Ya gotta believe'' mantra helped lift the
Mets out of mediocrity to a National League pennant.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven years later, Bezos is making the same pitch. Since
opening its e-doors for business, Amazon.com, the company he runs,
has amassed the better part of $1 billion in losses. Profits?
Patience, Bezos advises.
</P>
<P>
   The 1973 Mets ended up losing the World Series in seven games to
the Oakland A's. But Wall Street still wants to believe in Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the company said it had a net loss of $185 million in
the fourth quarter of 1999, compared with the the $46.4 million it
lost in the last three months of 1998. But the stock has jumped
$8.6875 a share since the numbers were announced.
</P>
<P>
   David D. Alger, chief executive of Fred Alger Management, the
money management firm, likes Amazon, even though he unloaded a lot
of the stock in December and January. Last week, he took some time
to talk about the company and its prospects. Following are excerpts
from the conversation. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. As of last August, you owned nearly two million Amazon
shares. But you cut that position substantially in December and
January. Why? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There are two psychological poles on Amazon, which has always
been a state-of-mind stock.
</P>
<P>
   One holds that it is eventually going to make money and it is
irrelevant how much they lose now if they keep their foot to the
floor and grow revenues and customers.
</P>
<P>
   The other pole is that this is a complete fraud, a business
model that leads to only one place, bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   In December, when Amazon made the point that they were swamped
with orders and would spend whatever it took to take care of that,
we thought, gee, that doesn't sound very good for their
profitability and were concerned that the negative gestalt would
push the stock down.
</P>
<P>
   For a while that view was correct. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Has something changed to alter your perception?  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. A couple of new factors emerged from their fourth-quarter
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   First, they are doing lots of deals with third parties, which
people really like. And they made the case that sequentially their
results are going to get better as far as gross margins are
concerned. And the number of new customers they added was
startling. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So does that mean you are looking to start buying the stock
again? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We were very impressed by some of the stuff they said, and
would get back in the stock if it was trading back in the $70s or
so. That will probably happen, because even though they are going
to be announcing a lot more deals this quarter, at some point
people are going to start worrying about the March quarter results.
This is a very volatile stock. (Amazon closed Friday at $78.5625) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. If you believe in the business plan, why not just buy and
hold the stock?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In general, I am a believer in their business plan. If I were
running the business, this is the way I would do it. But there is a
big difference in believing in Amazon's business model and
believing it is a good time to own their stock.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, it doesn't really hurt them to run the business as
aggressively as possible, because Wall Street is tolerating it and
they are able to fund themselves. You don't want to be conservative
and have someone else get into all these product categories first.
</P>
<P>
   An intelligent investor buys and holds this stock. I would do
that myself, but I am paid to create short-term performance for
people. You need an iron stomach to buy and hold a stock like this.
I have an iron stomach. I am not sure my shareholders do. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Last week, Amazon said the Securities and Exchange Commission
was looking at the way it accounted for the costs of shipping goods
to customers. It said that if the SEC mandated a change, gross
margins would shrink. Is that something to worry about?  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It could be, possibly, but one wonders whether or not these
things are relevant from time to time in the stock market.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are you worried that a concerted effort by the Federal
Reserve to slow the economy _ and retail spending _ will have an
adverse effect on Amazon's growth rate?  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think a slowing economy will affect Amazon, whether
it is done by the Fed or by cyclical factors. Year over year, their
revenues were up nearly 300 percent. The reason for that is people
are shifting their spending from stores to online.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So the skeptics are wrong, in your view. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The naysayers who assert Amazon is never going to be
successful are wrong. I think Amazon will make it really big.

BACK HOME IN SENEGAL, A TOUGH PATH FOR AN ENTREPRENEUR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID HECHT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAKAR, Senegal _ Massata Thioune left Senegal for New York in
1986 with just $250 in his pocket. He had no Western education and
spoke no English. But he knew how to sew clothes; he had been
apprenticed to his father, a tailor, from the age of 6.
</P>
<P>
   He was also imbued with the credo of the Sufi Islamic
brotherhood to which his family belongs: ``Pray as if you will die
tomorrow, and work as if you will live forever.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1988, Thioune (pronounced choon) had a factory on Seventh
Avenue, making office attire with a West African style and
sensibility. Two years later, Massata Fashions was taking orders
from national retail chains like T.J. Maxx and Marshall's and
directly from consumers through a mail order catalog. The company
was soon averaging $2 million a year in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1996, Thioune took a fateful step: he moved his factory
home to Senegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming here seemed like such a good idea at the time,'' said
Thioune, 40, in his Dakar factory, amid dozens of sewing machines
that are now idle. Senior Senegalese government officials had
approached him with offers of tax breaks and easy financing to buy
the building he would need.
</P>
<P>
   And he knew that the country, a former French colony where
fashion consciousness runs high, had plenty of skilled tailors who
would not demand American wages. ``I figured, why pay U.S. workers
$250 a week, when you can pay Senegalese workers $150 a month for
better work?''
</P>
<P>
   But problems appeared quickly. The first was getting timely
deliveries from local textile companies. ``There was always an
excuse,'' Thioune said. ``One day a machine was broken, and the
only person who knew how to fix it had not come in. The next day it
was someone's birthday, and nobody had come to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he had the fabric he needed, his own plant's output was
hampered by frequent blackouts, which not only cost him work time
but also damaged his sewing machines when the power came and went
without warning. By the time spare parts could be obtained, he
said, he had missed the deadline for a recurring $260,000 order, a
huge chunk of his annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   Similar problems over the next two years cut his revenue by more
than half and left him with $2.5 million of canceled goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to stop taking orders,'' he said. ``For now, I'm just
trying to sell off what I've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Since President Clinton visited the continent in 1998,
administration officials have been describing sub-Saharan Africa as
one of the world's big untapped business opportunities. But the
region produces few internationally competitive goods other than
raw materials, and its share of world trade is tiny and falling.
</P>
<P>
   Several American initiatives are meant to help entrepreneurs
like Thioune get started in the region. The Overseas Private
Investment Cooperation, a government-sponsored agency, has set up
new loan funds for Africa, including $350 million to improve
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   A bill before Congress would relax quotas and tariffs on
clothing made in Africa; different versions were passed by the
House and Senate last year and have yet to be reconciled.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses face many obstacles in Africa, from corruption to
inflation to poor infrastructure, but there is little agreement
about how difficult they are to overcome or which is the most
harmful. To Thioune, the local mind-set is the biggest problem.
``Even I forgot how things worked here,'' he said. ``There is still
a slave-and-master attitude here that undermines efforts to work
together.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most African economies have two aspects: a moribund official one
and a more energetic informal one, full of unregistered businesses
and ad hoc markets. Informal economic activity tends to organize
around ethnic or cultural affiliations rather than corporate
entities.
</P>
<P>
   In Senegal, less than 30 percent of the urban population is
formally employed, but what is called the ``real economy'' provides
livelihoods for the rest. It operates mainly through the country's
networks of Sufi Islamic brotherhoods, to which nearly all
Senegalese belong.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under French rule, the Sufi brotherhoods formed the basis for
fishing and agricultural collectives; when drought in the 1970s
accelerated migration to the cities, the brotherhoods diversified
into cottage industries and trade. Through daras, or prayer groups,
brotherhood members pool resources and gain access to small-scale
credit.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of members of the most visible brotherhood, the
Moruide, sell watches and sunglasses on the streets of New York and
other major cities.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the brotherhoods have formalized their business
activities, according to Allione Ndoe, a Senegalese business
consultant. But he said the enterprises tend to be ``hierarchical
and labor intensive, which is only good for certain kinds of
activities, like farming and petty trade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Creating industry requires strategic planning,'' he said,
``and at this stage they're mostly just concerned with the short
term.''
</P>
<P>
   Thioune belongs to the Mouride brotherhood, but he said he runs
Massata Fashions on American lines. ``Many of my workers are from
other brotherhoods,'' he said. ``All I care about is that they're
honest and hard working.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Mourides are critical of Thioune and his approach. ``If a
Mouride has difficulties,'' one leader of the brotherhood said,
``he should meet with other Mourides to discuss the problems and
they will then help.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thioune sees the brotherhood's role differently. ``Mouridism
provides the motivation and discipline for prayer and work,'' he
said. ``That's it.'' He said some ``opportunistic'' members try to
get money from him by claiming to be marabouts, or spiritual
guides. ``They're not real marabouts,'' he said, ``and I never give
them anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Thioune, many West African businesspeople intertwine the
spiritual and the secular. Supernatural powers have been attributed
to some of the most powerful, like Babani Sissoko, a Malian who
built a billion-dollar empire of international hotels, diamond
mines and a regional airline, only to see it collapse under heavy
debts after he ran into legal trouble in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The businesses of most of Africa's informal entrepreneurs are
more stable than Sissoko's, but Western investors know little about
working with them. And critics of the recent United States
initiatives for Africa say that even American-style entrepreneurs
like Thioune are being left out.
</P>
<P>
   The investment agency recently set up a $105 million direct
equity fund to invest in African private enterprises in amounts of
$4.5 million to $7.5 million, according to Ndoe, who advises the
fund. ``But it is projecting American scale on Africa,'' he said.
Except in South Africa, where the fund does not invest, ``few
African companies are big enough to qualify.''
</P>
<P>
   Thioune says financing is not his problem. ``I know plenty of
ways to generate capital here,'' he said. And he has looked far
afield for opportunities; lately he has begun importing New
York-style pickles, cranberry juice and other American foods for
sale to expatriates and Senegal's small middle class, which
considers the goods exotic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a stopgap measure until Massata Fashions gets going
again,'' he said. ``I know I can mass-produce clothing here cheaper
and better than anywhere in the world. I just have to figure out
how.''

DEFENSE LAWYERS IN CAPITAL CASES OFTEN LACK RESOURCES AND
COMPETENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ As Illinois examines what went wrong with a justice
system that sent 13 innocent men to death row, one common thread
has already emerged: poorly financed, often incompetent defense
lawyers who failed to uncover and present key evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a defense lawyer failed to prepare any strategy for
his client at the death penalty hearing the day after the
conviction, saying he had been hoping that the jury would opt for
manslaughter charges.
</P>
<P>
   Another defense lawyer rambled so incoherently during a death
penalty trial that a state Supreme Court justice wrote that the
proceeding ``would border on the comical if only it were
make-believe.''
</P>
<P>
   A third lawyer simply failed to attend some critical hearings,
arrived late at others and neglected to call witnesses who had
volunteered to testify about a defendant's character.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal defense for death row inmates has simply been
inadequate,'' said Elisabeth Semel, who heads an American Bar
Association project that focuses on legal representation for people
facing the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that opponents of the death penalty
criticize the legal system for failing to provide adequate
defenses. But in Illinois, the same criticism is now being offered
by some supporters of executions, many of whom now back Gov. George
Ryan's decision this week to place a moratorium on implementation
of the death penalty until a panel can study it.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, a moderate Republican who supports the death
penalty, announced the moratorium after new evidence cleared 13 men
who had been convicted and sent to death row since 1977. All 13
were released from prison.
</P>
<P>
   In supporting the governor's decision, Mayor Richard M. Daley of
Chicago, who prosecuted some of the death penalty cases as Cook
County state's attorney in the 1980s, said the defense lawyers in
some of those cases were sometimes incompetent and lacked the money
to conduct their own thorough investigations and compete against
the police and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the cases involved questions of poor defense work.
Some also resulted in accusations of overly aggressive police
officials and prosecutorial misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   But just as striking is the fact that in three cases, college
students working on class projects at Northwestern University were
able to find evidence that had escaped the attention of defense
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   While a proper defense in a death penalty case takes months of
research and costs $250,000 or more, Semel said, defendants in
these cases are often represented by lawyers who are paid a few
thousand dollars, or less, and spend only two days on a case.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get what you pay for,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the actual trial, judges conduct separate
hearings in each case to determine whether a defendant should be
executed, which adds to the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to afford good legal help, the families of defendants
often settle, in desperation, for any lawyer who will take a case,
regardless of reputation. The results are not surprising. A Chicago
Tribune examination of death penalty cases found that 33 defendants
sentenced to die were represented by a lawyer who had been
disbarred or suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of these inmates, in some cases, depends on volunteers
unearthing evidence, or just plain luck.
</P>
<P>
   While a spotlight has been cast on the Illinois system, some
legal experts contend that many of the same problems of woeful
representation exist in many states.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts have emerged from around the nation of defense lawyers
who slept through trials, or came to court drunk. Courts have
assigned death penalty cases to lawyers who have never tried a
criminal case, like tax lawyers. And for many of the decent,
hardworking lawyers who take death penalty cases, the money paid by
poor families is generally so paltry that paying for a thorough
investigation is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get these families who go shopping for a lawyer with, say,
$10,000, which seems like all the money in the world to them,''
said Lawrence Marshall, a law professor who heads the Center on
Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University. ``A good lawyer
will tell them it can't possibly be done for that money. So they
keep looking, until they find someone who will take the case. It's
usually a down-on-the-luck lawyer who figures the case is probably
going to plead anyway, so it's a quick $10,000.''
</P>
<P>
   He said many of these lawyers have never tried a death penalty
case, which tend to be complicated. And they do not have the money
to do some of the basic legwork needed.
</P>
<P>
   Seymour Simon, a former Illinois supreme court justice and
longtime foe of the death penalty, said he believed the poor legal
representation for defendants made the death penalty unjust.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois court in 1982 once denied an appeal to the death
penalty on the grounds of incompetent legal representation _ only
to turn to a case weeks later on the disbarment of the very same
lawyer, Archie Weston, who had represented the condemned man,
Dennis Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was accused of looting an estate,'' said Simon. ``We asked
him why he had missed a disciplinary hearing. He said at the time
he was so stressed out he couldn't think straight.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the period he was talking about matched the
time he was representing the death row defendant. A new trial was
ordered, which resulted in another conviction. This is one of the
13 cases cited by Ryan in his decision.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, DNA evidence proved Williams was innocent of two
murder charges. He was freed in 1996 after spending 18 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The wrongful conviction cost Cook County, which administered the
trials, nearly $13 million in damages to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have recently cited the accounts of such mistakes and
poor legal representation in calling for changes to federal
execution law. Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., said it seemed
obvious that mistakes caught in Illinois were occurring in other
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Illinois was just honest enough to admit it,'' Feingold said.
</P>
<P>
   But while concerns have grown over poor legal representation and
mistaken convictions, laws in recent years have nonetheless cut
legal aid for defendants who cannot afford their own lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress eliminated spending for the 20 Death Penalty
Resource Centers, which existed to help mount the appeals of death
row inmates, who are almost always poor.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, there has been little effort to improve legal help
for poor defendants, even though 20 wrongful convictions resulted
in inmates being sent to death row _ the most in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in Florida recently enacted a so-called fast-track
system that shortens times for appeals for inmates sentenced to
die.
</P>
<P>
   Poor people charged with serious crimes have been entitled to
legal assistance since the U.S. Supreme Court's Gideon vs.
Wainwright decision in 1963. But that aid varies sharply among the
states. Alabama pays $30 an hour to lawyers for out-of-court work
while representing poor defendants. New York, which is regarded as
having one of the best systems for the poor, pays $125 an hour,
still far less than a good lawyer in private practice would charge.
New York also has a Capital Defender Unit, which specializes in
cases that are eligible for the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Even prosecutors acknowledge that defense lawyers typically
start at a disadvantage when they go up against experienced
prosecutors. Richard Devine, the state's attorney in Cook County,
noted that his office has 300 lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time someone is trying a capital case, they have had a
lot of experience,'' Devine said.
</P>
<P>
   Semel used a boxing analogy to describe the disparity in
resources and experience between prosecutors and defense lawyers in
most death penalty cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a match between Mike Tyson and Martin Short,'' she
said, ``and the referee _ the judge _ is on Tyson's payroll.''

<P>
   Jeffrey Archer, a flamboyant member of the House of Lords and
best-selling novelist, was expelled from the Conservative Party for
five years for having concealed damaging details of a 1986 scandal
involving a prostitute that forced him to give up his candidacy in
November for the first elected mayor of London. The party's ethics
and integrity committee said his behavior was ``reprehensible.'' He
called the punishment ``grossly unfair.''

<P>
   A group of survivors of the 1995 massacre of up to 8,000 Bosnian
Muslims in Srebrenica tried to file a complaint at the
international war crimes tribunal in The Hague, charging U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and other officials with partial
responsibility for failing to protect the town. Fred Eckhard,

BALLOT CONSPIRACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arrogance is an obnoxious trait in human relations generally. In
elections it is poison.
</P>
<P>
   So the belated decision by Texas Governor George Bush, New York
Governor George Pataki, and New York's Republican establishment to
end their guerrilla warfare against Senator John McCain is welcome.
The New Yorkers were trying to muscle McCain off their ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The arrogance involved in the operation was colossal, and the
perpetrators should have known better. Manipulating intricate
procedures dictated by the state party, Pataki's henchmen were
ready to eliminate McCain from the March 7 primary ballot in more
than half the state's congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   This was an outrage from the start. Advising voters whom to
choose is politics. Telling voters they have no choice is the act
of a dictator. It is certainly no way to win the hearts of voters
either in a primary election or in November.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did himself no favor by equivocating on this issue until
forced to relent by McCain's big victory in New Hampshire. The
speed with which he and Pataki were able to call off their dogs
proved that they are, indeed, the inside players, just at the time
Bush is trying to portray McCain as too much of an insider.
</P>
<P>
   Such mixed messages are proliferating from the Bush camp this
week. He is trying to paint McCain as a liberal, when the
congressional rating organizations all say the reverse. Bush
allowed a supporter in South Carolina to attack McCain's commitment
to veterans _ an attack that is a sure loser. And Bush claimed on
Thursday to be ``the person with a reform agenda'' _ territory
already occupied by McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Bush's father won the presidency through a masterful
job of defining Michael Dukakis as a liberal too far out of the
mainstream to be trusted with the White House. Now Governor Bush is
having great difficulty defining McCain _ or himself.
</P>
<P>
   By clearing the way for an even-footed debate in New York, Bush
has given an opportunity to the voters there, and to his own
sputtering campaign.

NEWS ANALYSIS: AUSTRIA STUCK IN A POSITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (With AUSTRIA-POLITICS, AUSTRIA-U.S.) 
(rk) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ The two weeks of diplomatic whipping that
Austria has absorbed over the inclusion of Joerg Haider's
anti-immigrant Freedom Party in its new government has been quite
extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, that coalition government took office at a tense
ceremony, as protesters clashed with riot policemen outside, and
the diplomatic breach widened. Washington quickly recalled its
ambassador ``for consultations,'' and European governments began
downgrading their relations with Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Italy had a neo-Fascist party in its government in 1994, and
Europe did not threaten to blackball its diplomats, nor did the
Belgian foreign minister say it would be immoral to ski in the
Italian Alps.
</P>
<P>
   And many European countries _ to say nothing of the eastern
European ones lining up to join _ have had Communists in government
who have made excuses for Stalin or other dictators. Plenty have
cozy diplomatic relations with dictators from Cuba to Libya to
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, a rupture with Austria has happened before.When
the nation elected Kurt Waldheim president in 1986 after it was
revealed that he had served with Hitler's army in the Balkans in
World War II, the country was put under virtual diplomatic boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Waldheim, a previous two-term secretary-general of the United
Nations, was barred from entering the United States in May 1987, a
ban that remains in effect. He made few state visits during his
six-year term as president, and Austria, which was then negotiating
to join the European Union, received almost no official American or
West European visitors of note except for Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   The warning on Monday that 14 members of the European Union
could isolate the 15th arrived with virtually no public debate. The
foreign ministers met in secret _ exactly how many is not clear,
since at least one, from Denmark, told a newspaper that he was
informed so late that there was not even time to disagree.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction from Haider, attacking Belgium as corrupt and
France's president as confused and incompetent, was hardly
diplomatic. But the counterattacks from seasoned European diplomats
_ who repeated their accusations that Haider was a racist, a
xenophobe and a Nazi sympathizer _ were also blunt.
</P>
<P>
   Going beyond his remark about the immorality of skiing in the
Austrian Alps if Haider was in power, the Belgian foreign minister
even said Europe could do without Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, European diplomats would not even take the word
of Wolfgang Schuessel, Haider's coalition partner, that Haider is
not as bad as they think. Schuessel, who has been Austria's foreign
minister for four years, presumably knows them all, but the usual
collegial courtesies were not extended.
</P>
<P>
   And before President Thomas Klestil would sanction the coalition
between Schuessel's People's Party and Haider's Freedom Party, he
made them sign an extraordinary declaration that he seemed to have
drawn up overnight.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long, somewhat rambling pledge called ``Responsibility
for Austria _ A Future in the Heart of Europe,'' promising
adherence to the spiritual and moral values of Europe, recognizing
charters on peace and monetary union, accepting responsibility for
Nazism, and even suggesting that compensation might be paid to
forced laborers.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Schuessel and Haider signed away their right to pass
any national legislation that disagrees with the thinking of the
European Union _ except that, since the document does not mention
any court that could enforce it, they do not have to keep their
word. It was done for show.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions on how Austria ended up in such a weak position vary
depending on whom one asks.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the answer is simple: Hitler was an Austrian, and
everyone in Europe has at least a grandparent who remembers the
Nazis. ``After all,'' said Sylvie Rais, a Frenchwoman who said she
has been arguing all week with her Iranian-born husband about
Europe's moral position, ``Austria is le ventre de la bete,''
literally, the womb of the beast.
</P>
<P>
   The French newspapers have been unabashed about casting the Nazi
shadow over the current Austrian political deal. The cover of
Friday's Liberation, the liberal French daily, was a sepia-tinted
photo of Schuessel and Haider under the headline ``The Brown
Waltz'' _ a blending of Vienna's classic dance and brown-shirted
storm troopers.
</P>
<P>
   That only confirms the fears of Elfi Dobusch, 56, who brought
Haider some chocolate for his 50th birthday last week, and said
other Europeans were upset about his rise ``because our historical
past isn't pure _ but people should forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask politicians, and one hears that it was pure power politics.
Many believe, as has been reported in Europe, that Klestil, a
senior Austrian diplomat during the Waldheim crisis, and former
Chancellor Viktor Klima, a Social Democrat whose party came in
first in the elections in October but was squeezed out of power by
the new coalition, called friends around Europe and asked them to
chime in with condemnations of Haider. As luck would have it, many
of those leaders are center-leftists who were at a Holocaust
conference in Stockholm, so the stage could hardly have been more
perfectly set.
</P>
<P>
   Also, many European countries have right-wing movements, and
this would signal them that they too could be crushed. In France,
whose conservative president, Jacques Chirac, was in the forefront
of the overwhelmingly leftist attacks on Haider, Jean-Marie Le
Pen's openly racist National Front won 15 percent of the vote in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Others quietly say the Portuguese, who now hold the rotating
presidency of the European Union, wanted their tenure to be
remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Among analysts of European affairs, the answers get more
complex, and divide on whether the speaker feels Haider should have
been kept out of government at all costs or should be accepted out
of respect for democracy, and then watched carefully.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There are now fundamental accepted values, and a line is
crossed when someone who's expressed sympathy for the Third Reich
is allowed in,'' said John Palmer of the European Policy Center, a
Brussels-based research institute. In 1996, the European Union
passed the Amsterdam treaty on democracy and human rights with
provisions for expelling members.
</P>
<P>
   It was drafted in anticipation of new Eastern European members;
if Romania, for instance, relapsed into dictatorship, it could be
kicked out. It was never intended as a bludgeon for democracies
like Austria, but now European leaders are asserting the right to
judge just what is a democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Another camp argues that Austria got what it got because the
rest of the European Union just does not like it very much.
</P>
<P>
   Austria has never been a team player. It joined the European
Union only in 1995, after the isolation of the Waldheim era and the
European unity fostered by the fall of the Berlin Wall enabled it
to pull away from the neutrality it had to promise to get Soviet
troops to withdraw in 1955, thus ending 10 years of Allied
occupation. Like fellow union member Sweden, Austria still clings
to that neutrality when it comes to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been half-hearted on defense policy,'' said
Charles Grant of the Center for European Reform, another research
institute. Unlike Sweden, Austria is in a sensitive strategic area.
It has joined NATO's Partnership for Peace, but has not applied for
alliance membership; last spring, it refused to let NATO planes fly
over to bomb nearby Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   And Austria has few supporters with European heft, Grant argued.
``France has always been hostile, and a little bit contemptuous of
Austria,'' he said. Germany, still sensitive about annexing Austria
under the Nazis in 1938, was not a big brother, but had ``the same
difficult relationship that Britain does with Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the opportunity to condemn Nazism is not one that
vote-seeking European politicians like to miss. And it is
considerably easier to threaten a country like Austria, with 8
million people and an admittedly ambivalent relationship to its
Nazi past, than a country of 77 million people who spend German
marks and who have atoned much longer and more openly for Nazi
crimes.

MEDDLING ON TAIWAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because America's Taiwan policy is balanced on a deliberate
ambiguity _ a vagueness meant to discourage Beijing from attacking
Taiwan and Taiwan from provoking Beijing _ the Taiwan Security
Enhancement Act, passed overwhelmingly Tuesday in the House, comes
as a gratuitous gesture of congressional irresponsibility.
</P>
<P>
   If the bill were to be passed by the Senate and if there were
enough votes to overcome President Clinton's promised veto, the
result would be an increase in the number of Taiwan's military
officers trained in the United States, the institution of direct
communications between the military establishments in Washington
and Taipei, and an annual review of threats to Taiwan's security.
</P>
<P>
   These symbolic gestures could antagonize Beijing enough to
provoke the regime there into some rash action. The bill could also
induce in Taiwan's leaders a perilous belief that they have free
rein to cross certain red lines that the governments on either side
of the Taiwan Straits have long observed. The bill, which
Republican House leaders Tom DeLay and Richard Armey chose as the
first major legislation of the new year, contains nothing, however,
to deter China from attacking Taiwan nor to discourage Taiwan from
provoking Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The bill deserves to be defeated in the Senate. Failing that, it
ought to be vetoed by Clinton. Its only substantive aim can be to
affect presidential elections in this country and in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill exemplifies a structural change in the roles of
president and Congress in foreign policy. There is certainly a
significant constitutional role reserved for Congress in the making
of foreign policy, but in recent years legislators have recklessly
withheld America's dues to the UN, refused confirmation of
qualified ambassadors, and sought to legislate questionable curbs
on the exercise of American power abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The most frequent target of sorcerer's apprentices in Congress
is China policy, and this latest foray into one of the world's most
dangerous hot spots is a strong argument for reviving executive
branch prerogatives in foreign policy.

CANDIDATES LOOK AHEAD TO CRUCIAL CALIFORNIA PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the quirky preliminaries over, the
presidential race has moved squarely into even odder and untested
terrain: a new kind of ``national primary'' on March 7 in which
more than a dozen states seem all but certain to determine the
major parties' nominees. And no place may turn out to be more
important that day than California, long the state the nation loves
to mock as a collection of kooks and conservatives who produced
both Ronald Reagan and Jerry Brown.
</P>
<P>
   For years, California has been the overgrown stepchild of the
nominating process, the most populous state whose primary fell too
late to matter, usually in June. But now, a moved-up primary and a
new voting system that is, well, a little bit kooky, is poised to
make California the first state where all the candidates appear on
the same ballot, regardless of party, in a preview of where its
crucial 54 electoral votes may go in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the things that make California unique,'' said
Leslie Goodman, a Republican consultant in Sacramento who supports
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. ``The highest vote-getter will
certainly be perceived as the strongest candidate for a general
election contest.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, polls have shown Vice President Al Gore holding a better
than 2-1 edge over former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey among
likely Democratic voters, and Bush with about a 40-point lead among
Republicans over his nearest challenger, Sen. John McCain of
Arizona. Gore and Bush have each polled about one-quarter of the
overall vote. But pollsters warn that things could change quickly,
given the national headlines generated by McCain's strong victory
in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his losses in Iowa and New Hampshire, Bradley still has
enough money to match Gore's spending in this state's brutally
expensive media markets, where it can cost a candidate $1.5 million
to run a television advertisement that is seen by the average voter
10 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Californians have been kind of slumbering along this election
year,'' said Mark DiCamillo, director of the statewide Field Poll
in San Francisco. ``But now it's going to become the front burner.
It's going to matter.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for all its cliched image as a land of fruits, nuts and
flakes, California is an increasingly reliable proxy for the nation
as a whole, with high-tech industry and giant farming operations,
international trade and small start-up businesses, a shrinking
white majority and an ideological spectrum that runs from
gun-owning ranchers to yuppie entrepreneurs and aging liberals who
came for the '60s revolution and never went home. More than ever,
this is where trends begin.
</P>
<P>
   That is why all the candidates will be apportioning the most
precious resource they have in the next five weeks _ their time _
flying back and forth across the country to compete in what Bill
Carrick, a leading Democratic consultant here, calls ``the red-eye
primary,'' which occurs the same day as those in New York,
Maryland, Missouri, Ohio and most of New England.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley were both in California on Thursday, and McCain
is coming for a quick visit on Saturday. Bush made two major policy
speeches here last fall and has already produced Spanish-language
television advertisements that will be used to woo the state's
growing Hispanic electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two candidates may go into California, but only one of them's
coming out,'' said Dan Schnur, a strategist for McCain and a
veteran of past California campaigns, including former Gov. Pete
Wilson's 1994 re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Schnur was referring to the Republican contest, but his analysis
could apply to the Democrats, too, especially if Gore wins the
state that he has long called his fire wall.
</P>
<P>
   Any predictions here are complicated by the state's new
``blanket'' primary system, intended to make elections more
accessible. In this system, the names of all candidates will appear
on the same ballot, regardless of party.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But because the two major parties' rules require that delegates
be selected only by party members, the ballots will also be coded
to conduct a second tally, in which only Republican votes will
count toward selecting Republican delegates and only Democratic
votes will be used to pick Democratic delegates.
</P>
<P>
   That means that one candidate, say McCain, who has shown appeal
to independent voters, could win the overall popular vote but lose
all the Republican delegates to Bush if the Texas governor finished
first among Republicans, who apportion their delegates
winner-take-all. Bradley could win more total votes than Gore, who
could still win the most Democratic delegates, who are divided
proportionally. No political professionals here think that outcome
is likely, but it is theoretically possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a real McCain-Bush fight, and a Gore-Bradley fight,
who knows what'll happen,'' said Bob Mulholland, an adviser to the
state Democratic Party. ``But obviously the most important thing is
to win the most delegates.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 15 percent of the delegates needed for each party's
nomination are at stake here, and both the Bush and Gore forces are
confident.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has no organization here, and must get through Republican
contests not only in South Carolina, but also in Michigan and
Washington before he can even get here. Goodman, the Bush
supporter, said: ``This is the time that a national campaign that
has laid the groundwork and has the resources will make a
difference. You can't just power your way through March 7 on
Internet fund raising and `a message that's caught fire.'''
</P>
<P>
   Schnur acknowledged that McCain's best asset at the moment was
buzz, in a state that has long supported causes like overhauling
campaign finance. He noted dryly that state Sen. James L. Brulte, a
Bush supporter, ``is one of the smartest politicians in the state,
but I'll take the covers of Time and Newsweek any day.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has less buzz but more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that ever concerned me was if Bradley had a
very big win in New Hampshire and got a huge press surge out of
that,'' said John Emerson, a former Clinton White House aide who
managed Gary Hart's winning 1984 campaign here against former Vice
President Walter F. Mondale, and who now supports Gore. ``That
hasn't happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore holds several pronounced advantages in a state where
President Clinton has long been more popular than he is nationally:
strong support among organized labor and minorities, and from
women, who make up nearly 60 percent of the Democratic electorate
statewide. Bradley has done best with highly educated voters and
men.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have plenty of voters who are in the southern New Hampshire
technology-oriented, higher-income, educated mold,'' said Carrick,
the consultant, who is not working for either Democrat. ``It's just
that we've got plenty of every other kind of Democrat you can think
of, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's state campaign manager, Gale Kaufman, a respected
organizer with close ties to union groups, said she did not
discount Gore's overwhelming support from unions and most of the
state's Democratic elected officials, including Gov. Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not underestimating the potential of those people for
resources and money,'' Kaufman said. ``But what does that mean in
terms of votes, in a state like California that's so big and
issue-oriented? I think we're in very good shape in the open
primary on issues, whether that's on the registration and licensing
of guns or universal health care. The fact that there's such a
diverse population is as helpful to us as to anybody else.''

 &HT;    Will crusade against tobacco burn McCain?
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr and Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ John McCain tells campaign crowds that he has never
voted for a tax increase in 17 years in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   It is a straightforward comment that leaves no room for
exceptions. It helps McCain demonstrate his conservative
credentials in the race for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a slight problem with McCain's assertion. It isn't
true, by most accounts.
</P>
<P>
   McCain led the fight in the Senate two years ago to pass a $516
billion tobacco bill that would have hiked cigarette taxes by $1.10
a pack over five years.
</P>
<P>
   McCain not only voted for the bill in the Commerce Committee,
which he chairs. He wrote it.
</P>
<P>
   McCain calls the $1.10 a fee, not a tax. But the bipartisan
Joint Committee on Taxation labels it a ``tax,'' as do most
analysts following the issue.
</P>
<P>
   A strange thing about McCain's campaign for president is that he
rarely mentions tobacco, even when talks about taking on special
interests and, when necessary, members of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   Taking on the tobacco companies would seem to be a winning issue
for a candidate who not only relishes a good fight, but wants to
attract the broad center of the American electorate.
</P>
<P>
   But the primary calendar has a number of tobacco-growing states
in the early going, beginning with South Carolina on Feb. 19. The
Arizona Republican may be forced to confront his role as architect
of the tobacco legislation of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina and Kentucky produce 60 percent of the nation's
tobacco. Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia account
for most of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that McCain will find himself under attack from
Gov. George W. Bush on the issue. Few politicians would risk
aligning themselves with Big Tobacco, and Bush supported a tax
overhaul in Texas in 1997 that contained a 20-cent-a-pack tax
increase.
</P>
<P>
   The issue may have more potential as a way to dent McCain's
reputation as a straight talker and to paint him as promoter of a
big-government program that Republicans generally oppose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Undoubtedly, this will be one issue that will sway people one
way or another. The fact that he was willing to raise taxes by $100
billion is an issue,'' said Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.), Bush's
point person in Congress. Coverdell was referring to a study that
estimated that the tax hike would bring in $100 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the National Smokers Alliance is running an ad on South
Carolina television that contrasts the proposed cigarette tax with
McCain's comments about taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying one thing and doing another. That's the real John
McCain,'' the ad says. The National Smokers Alliance is a
tax-exempt group with 3 million members, said Thomas Humber, the
alliance's president. As late as last year, the group received most
of its financial backing from tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   McCain gave a scathing response to the ad. ``I'm honored to be
attacked by the people who addicted our children and lied to
Congress,'' he told reporters in Beaufort, S.C., on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But even some of McCain's supporters in South Carolina objected
to his legislation. ``I was not very impressed with what he did on
tobacco,'' Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said.
</P>
<P>
   While Graham does not represent a tobacco-growing district, he
said he objected strongly to the proposed the tax hike.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's legislation would have forced the tobacco industry to
pay $516 billion over 25 years on health, public education and
anti-smoking programs. It would have given the federal government
control over marketing tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more controversial were provisions that would have
broadened the authority of the Food and Drug Administration to
regulate nicotine and capped liability claims against the tobacco
industry at $6.5 billion each year and imposed multimillion-dollar
penalties for failing to reduce the number of youths who smoke.
</P>
<P>
   McCain maintains that his bill would not have raised taxes. ``It
actually would have reduced your taxes because it would have cut
down on tobacco-related illnesses that cost taxpayers $60 billion a
year'' in Medicare and Medicaid costs, he said in an interview.
Those government health programs account for no more than 40
percent of the $50 billion to $73 billion annual cost of treating
tobacco-related illnesses, according to government and academic
studies.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also would have created education programs aimed
at the ``3,000 young Americans who start smoking every day,''
McCain said. ``One thousand of them die early from a
tobacco-related illness.''
</P>
<P>
   There are myriad of reasons behind the bill's demise.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's price tag was nearly $150 billion more than the
$368.5-billion deal reached between the tobacco industry and 40
state attorneys general on June 20, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry balked at the $516 billion figure, trotting
out economists who said the legislation would actually cost upwards
of $800 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded to us that McCain was asking the tobacco companies
to voluntarily file for bankruptcy,'' said J. Phil Carlton, a
tobacco lobbyist. ``It was clear that it was the highest tax and
the most regressive tax on poor people ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies also complained that the legislation
lacked enough liability protection from lawsuits, the driving force
that led them to enter negotiations with the attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   The morning after McCain won approval for his bill from the
Commerce Committee, tobacco executives at the nation's largest
firms held a conference call with their Washington lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   There was great concern that the trust established during the
negotiations with the attorneys general had evaporated, that
Capitol Hill wanted to use the industry as a whipping boy during a
congressional election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood was somber,'' said Scott Williams. ``We saw something
really good for the country going down in the flames of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry responded quickly with an aggressive lobbying and
$40 million advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than silence McCain, the industry's actions invigorated
him.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his staff worked closely with the president's top
domestic policy advisers, senators and health care advocates to
give the bill a chance on the floor. One change was to provide
$28.5 billion in economic assistance to farmers.
</P>
<P>
   One group noticably absent was the tobacco companies. McCain
kept them locked out of the room.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also failed to win Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing like the McCain bill is going to pass,'' Lott told
reporters at the time. ``This bill that started out
well-intentioned has grown like Topsy.''
</P>
<P>
   There was considerable irony in Lott's opposition because Senate
GOP leaders handed McCain the tobacco issue in early 1998, despite
McCain's famously difficult relationship with some colleagues. His
mandate was to protect Republicans against Democratic attacks on
tobacco in the 1998 election. Despite Lott's pronouncement, McCain
continued to try to win on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican leadership wasn't serious, but John McCain
was,'' said Bruce Reed, the president's chief domestic policy
adviser. ``McCain saw a genuine opportunity to get something
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed recalled how McCain came under fire from the Senate
leadership, how groups like the National Smokers Alliance ran ads
in Arizona attacking his bill. McCain ``never wavered,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's bill died on June 17, three votes shy after four weeks
of floor debate. By that time, the bill was so loaded with
amendments that its initial supporters barely recognized it. ``They
(the Republican leaders) knew it was going to implode under its own
weight,'' said Michael Moore, the Democratic attorney general in
Mississippi who negotiated the initial settlement with the industry
.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the tobacco industry and conservatives had
convinced wavering lawmakers that the McCain bill was more a
Washington ``money grab'' than a way to stop the next generation
from smoking. During the months leading up to the floor fight,
Moore would meet regularly with McCain, Reed and members from the
health community. McCain had a policy of letting Moore and others
walk into his office at any time to talk about tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a champion who would be loyal even when the times
got tough,'' Moore said. ``He was that champion.''
</P>
<P>
   But another reason for the bill's failure was a split in the
public health community. Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop was
among those who said the legislation protected an industry that
manufactured a product that kills 400,000 people each year.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his allies say they are not worried about tobacco's
role in the primaries in South Carolina and other Southern states.
``It may hurt him where tobacco is grown, but that's not where a
lot of the population is. There's a lot of anti-smoking sentiment
as well,'' said Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.).
</P>
<P>
   But Republican Rep. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), a Bush supporter
whose district is home to R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and many
tobacco farms, said his constituents have not forgotten about
McCain's role.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Southeast never forgets anyone who affects their
livelihood,'' Burr said. ``This was an attack on agriculture and
the farmer.''

THE FITNESS MYTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The country is indebted to two professors, including one from
the University of Massachusetts, for resolving a nagging paradox:
As each year goes by, more and more Americans are overweight or
obese, even though we seem to be running, swimming, or skiing more
than ever.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that ``seem'' is the operative word. In fact, as
professors Rodney B. Warnick from UMass and John R. Kelly from the
University of Illinois point out in a new book, jogging is down
significantly from the 1980s, swimming is off, and ``the dropout
rate for most exercise programs is more than 50 percent.'' Fitness
craze? ``There never was one,'' say the authors of ``Recreation
Trends and Markets: The 21st Century.'' ``The idea of Americans
running around trying to keep fit appears to be a myth'' _ at least
as far as the majority of Americans is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Data exist on who does all of these things and how often because
it is important information to the marketing departments of
companies in the sports-gear and recreation businesses. The signs
for them are mixed _ unless they cater to newer activities still
growing in popularity, like in-line skating and snowboarding.
</P>
<P>
   These sports and several others attract a committed core group _
as well as considerable media attention _ but it is a rare physical
activity that is pursued by more than 10 percent of all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, we are not all hopeless couch potatoes. Warnick and Kelly
point to cruises, gambling, theme-park visiting, and golf as
recreational activities that Americans increasingly prefer, and
fully 35 percent of us do fitness walking of one sort or another.
Outdoor gardening is also winning adherents. But, Warnick says,
``The majority of people are not physically active.''
</P>
<P>
   That bottom-line judgment of his would be less worrisome if it
were not for the popularity of another leisure activity that the
professors' data show to be on the upswing: dining out at
restaurants. All in all, the picture is one of Americans who do
indeed like to gamble _ on our health.

SO YOU'RE A MILLIONAIRE. NOW WHAT? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., N.J.)   (With MILLIONAIRE-PROFILES)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6)  
(af) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Would you like to be a millionaire? That's a question that four
major television networks are posing, one way or another, these
days and that everyone can no doubt quickly _ and predictably _
answer. Unfortunately, though, you can't necessarily become one
just by winning $1 million or even more on a quiz show.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you're not careful, what's left after a gang of tax
collectors get through with you can disappear faster than winnings
in the terminator round of the Fox network's offering, ``Greed.''
</P>
<P>
   If money could talk, it would probably tell people with big
windfalls _ whether from inheritances, lawsuit settlements,
bonuses, exercised options of an Internet start-up, dumb-luck hits
from lotteries or appearances on quiz shows _ to be wary. You may
well have to develop a new persona _ or at least a new aptitude for
dealing with the swarm of relatives, former classmates and
strangers who want to ``help.''
</P>
<P>
   A state lottery, at least, gives winners time to learn how to
manage their money, if they spread the payoff over several years.
In New York, for winnings of more than $5,000, state and federal
taxes are withheld from lottery jackpots, for both residents and
nonresidents.
</P>
<P>
   But all of the new, hugely popular quiz shows pay off in a big
lump sum. You could win as much as $2 million on ``Greed'' and $1
million on ABC's ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire'' or CBS's
``Winning Lines.'' NBC's ``Twenty One'' lets you pile up the money
as long as your stock of correct answers holds out; last week,
Rahim Oberholtzer, a Harvard Law School student competing on
``Twenty One,'' won the biggest prize yet _ $1,120,000.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, relatively few members of America's fast-growing
millionaire club _ there are now about eight million households
with a net worth that large _ can credit their wealth to sudden,
unexpected strikes like those produced by quiz shows. Many have
turned businesses or other assets to cash; rarely is there anything
unexpected about this wealth, and it is not often created by the
financially naive.
</P>
<P>
   But there is now the possibility, however slim, that Regis
Philbin will be handing you an oversized check for $1 million, or
that the Prize Patrol will be knocking on your door. And there is
the slightly higher chance that your shares in a goofy Internet
start-up will start performing like the next Cisco Systems, Lucent
or Qualcomm.
</P>
<P>
   So what do you do if you find yourself in this exhilarating but
precarious position?
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing they should do is do nothing,'' said Elizabeth
Sullivan, a financial planner at IFG Network Securities of Fairfax,
Va., and one of various experts consulted by Money &AMP; Business.
Don't make snap decisions about a house, a car or a world cruise.
Don't even think about a movie or book deal. And most certainly,
don't immediately quit your job.
</P>
<P>
   After all, you don't really have a million dollars. Game-show
winners typically get checks within a week or two after the program
is broadcast, with virtually nothing deducted _ no withholding for
federal or state income taxes, for Social Security or for any other
levies to which workers' paychecks are subject.
</P>
<P>
   The programs, however, will report your winnings to the
government, and when the tax collectors' cuts are eventually toted
up, a $1 million winner might find his prize lopped nearly in half,
depending on the state in which he lives.
</P>
<P>
   (New York, where ``Millionaire'' is taped, will not claim taxes
on quiz-show winnings from nonresidents, because the prize money
does not come from a ``business, trade, profession or occupation,''
according to Marc Carey, a spokesman for the State Department of
Taxation and Finance.)
</P>
<P>
   Even as a demi-millionaire, your first step should be rehearsing
a response to pitches from brokers, promoters of every description
and scam artists hoping to get to you through cousins twice
removed, so that you don't say or do something stupid in a weak
moment.
</P>
<P>
   If you're smart, you will first park your winnings in a money
market mutual fund or a money market account at a bank, the latter
paying a bit less interest but insured by the government for up to
$100,000. (If you're the belt-and-suspenders type, you could open
multiple accounts to get all your money covered.)
</P>
<P>
   And you almost certainly should seek professional advice _
something that the quiz shows leave to your own devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to help them win the money,'' said Bob Boden,
executive producer of ``Greed.'' ``Once they've done it, we're out
of the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts suggest that you assemble a professional team _ an
accountant, a lawyer and a financial planner _ keeping in mind that
some of the latter collect commissions rather than charge by the
hour. The best way to find any of these professionals is through
referrals from a trusted friend, relative or associate.
</P>
<P>
   In building a financial plan, you should broadly examine your
specific status _ age, resources, family situation, goals,
tolerance for risk and how the windfall should be integrated with
your other assets.
</P>
<P>
   The cost varies, but David G. Dietze, president of Point View
Financial Services, a fee-only money manager based in Summit, N.J.,
said a typical fee is one-quarter of 1 percent, or $2,500 for a $1
million winner with no more than the usual other middle-class
assets.
</P>
<P>
   The plan should help guide you through an array of issues you've
never really had to consider before. One is insurance _ don't
forget, you are now a deep-pocket target. You also need to make
sure that all those taxes get paid, and to decide whether to pay
off your mortgage and other debts.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are choices to be made about gifts, investments and
estate planning, not to mention that long-suppressed desire to quit
work or open a bed and breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   If you assume that rich people, including the new you, can
always find a tax dodge, the news is grim. Many deductions were
knocked out by the 1986 tax-law overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   You want to use income averaging to spread the liability over
several years? It's gone, except for distributions from retirement
plans for older or disabled workers. Shelters like cattle ranching
and oil drilling? These once-popular devices to get big first-year
deductions are largely gone, too. A credit remains for investing in
low-income housing, but it is probably too restrictive for
practical appeal.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not many ways to hide from the IRS on this one,'' said
Thomas P. Ochsenschlager, a tax specialist in the Vienna, Va.,
office of the Grant Thornton accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   What is left in the way of shelters is relatively little stuff,
and its relevance depends on your situation: marrying, to benefit
from an extra exemption and possibly lower joint rates (but watch
out that the marriage penalty doesn't bump you into a higher
bracket, which could more than offset any benefit); making sure to
make maximum contributions to tax-advantaged retirement or college
savings accounts; bunching up several years of charitable
donations; and, if itemized deductions are phased out at your new
income level, electing not to claim your children as exemptions so
that they can claim themselves in their presumably lower tax
bracket. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before deciding on a strategy for investing your newfound
wealth, it is best to clear away some other issues, the planners
say.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance, for example. Dietz suggests obtaining an umbrella
policy to cover a variety of possible claims, for at least the
amount of your assets. But your new wealth also means that you can
afford to raise auto and homeowner's deductibles to the maximum _
and at least consider cutting the amount of whole life insurance
you carry.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you should pay off credit card and most other debt,
planners advise, but you might want to keep your mortgage or, say,
a low-interest student loan, rather than deplete your windfall by
eliminating every last cent of debt. It's important to keep some
money readily available, they note; after all, it can be difficult
to pull money out of a home or other real estate if you need it
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   You should also make sure to update your will to include your
new assets. And you may want to settle up with a go-to person who
helped you with a quiz-show answer, perhaps on prearranged terms.
</P>
<P>
   Since your windfall could easily put you in jeopardy of federal
estate taxes of 37 percent to 55 percent _ this year and next,
estate assets above $1.35 million for a married couple are taxable
_ you may decide that you need to create a so-called bypass trust.
</P>
<P>
   It lets the maximum go to children or grandchildren tax-free
when the surviving spouse dies. Without a trust, which essentially
makes use of the deceased's exemption that would otherwise be lost,
only $675,000 would escape taxes.
</P>
<P>
   You may also want to buy some life insurance for estate-planning
purposes. It provides liquidity so that business or other assets do
not have to be sold to pay estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is probably time to consider moving what is left of your
new money out of that money-market account and into something more
ambitious. But don't be fooled: What your new wealth can do for
your standard of living may be less than you thought _ especially
if you are among the many who believe that the stock market returns
of the last five years, roughly twice the 10 percent historical
average, will continue. Many advisers think they won't.
</P>
<P>
   If you invest in stocks for the long term, rather than for quick
capital gains from trading stocks in a bull market, the income each
year could be quite modest, with dividends on the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index now averaging 1.25 percent. An investment of, say,
$250,000 in stocks paying a 3 percent dividend will generate $7,500
a year, before taxes _ enough for a nice family trip to Europe. You
could safely get $15,000 to $20,000 from bonds, which could buy a
semester at an Ivy League college.
</P>
<P>
   The experts suggest allocating some money to stocks, bonds and
perhaps to real estate, keeping in mind that your financial cushion
allows you to take more risk and to look at a broader range of
investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you need to look short-term, medium-term and long-term,''
Sullivan said, to meet predictable cash needs, like your children's
college education, retirement or a daughter's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Because you now have enough money to diversify properly, you may
want to stretch beyond mutual funds to create your own portfolio.
For stocks, studies have shown that if you spread money across
several industries, you need shares in only 8 to 15 companies to
avoid too much concentration.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual funds require less watching, but their management fees
can be hefty. And fund investors forfeit control over whether or
when to sell a particular holding, which has tax and investment
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, you will need to decide whether to put your money to
work in one shot or to feed it in over time. The second approach is
probably more comfortable, but less profitable historically.
</P>
<P>
   Or you might be attracted to annuities, with the money invested
in almost any combination of stocks and bonds. These products have
tax advantages, but they tie up your money and can be expensive to
buy (though there are no-load varieties). And be sure you know what
would happen if you died shortly after making the commitment.
</P>
<P>
   If the contract does not provide that you receive a minimum
number of payouts, you could lose the bulk of your investment.
</P>
<P>
   As for the temptation to tell off the boss and quit, don't do it
without careful thought. If you need a break, try to get a leave of
absence. It is easy to underestimate the need for a familiar daily
routine, not to mention the amount of money to maintain a game-show
enhanced lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would urge people to keep working,'' at least for awhile,
Dietze said. If you've gotten your finances in order, he added,
``you can always cut back.''

WINNERS DON'T YET HAVE THE FINAL ANSWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (With MILLIONAIRE-DREAMERS)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6)  
(af) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even before the heady effects of sudden wealth _ like the $1.12
million won by a Harvard law student on NBC's ``Twenty One'' last
week _ begin to dissipate, the mundane details of how to handle
such sums always intrude.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations with several of the biggest winners in the
quiz-show frenzy of recent months suggest that while they have
generally taken sensible, long-term views, some have also made
costly errors.
</P>
<P>
   Consider John Carpenter of Hamden, Conn., 32, a revenue officer
for the Internal Revenue Service who was the first contestant on
``Who Wants to be a Millionaire'' to take home a round $1 million.
Nothing was withheld from his winner's check. ``It was all zeros,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   His mistake was taking an accountant's ill-founded advice to
promptly send a $72,000 income-tax payment to New York State, in
which the program is taped, before the end of 1999 so that he and
his wife, Debbie, could deduct it from their federal tax for the
year. It turned out, however, that New York does not claim tax on
the quiz-show winnings of nonresidents.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, whose collection job does not require knowing ``real
intricate details'' of the tax code, took his misstep in stride.
``We'll just file a zero return and get the refund,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Shutterly, a Richmond, Va., banker who won $500,000 on
``Millionaire,'' made the same mistake, sending an unnecessary tax
payment to New York to maximize federal deductions.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the winners seem to be coping with the hazards of
sudden large sums, refusing to be enticed into profligate spending,
and _ thoughtfully, if in some cases without much professional help
_ considering their options.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel F. Blonsky, 34, a Miami lawyer and the other winner of
``Millionaire's'' top prize, is frowning, for example, on a
suggestion that he shelter income by buying a controlling interest
in a company with a large tax-carryforward. And he is dubious about
the idea of buying annuities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're expensive, and I don't like tying up my money,''
Blonsky explained.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his investment will be in stocks, he said. Blonsky is
hoping to find professionals who will outperform the market _ he
thinks it's possible to predict who they will be by studying their
track records and then interviewing them. He also plans to pick
stocks on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Like other winners, he also has plans to indulge himself a bit.
Blonsky, whose winnings represent ``several times'' his typical
annual income, said he would ``probably live a little larger'' _
not hesitating, for example, to pay scalpers' prices if his Duke
University Blue Devils basketball team made it to the Final Four in
Indianapolis this year.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter acknowledged buying ``one big toy, a BMW,'' and said
he and his wife would probably now be able to move to a house on a
larger lot.
</P>
<P>
   For Douglas Van Gundy, a $250,000 winner on ``Millionaire,'' and
his wife, Melissa, the extra $4,000 to $5,000 they figure to draw
from their new nest egg each year means expanded travel horizons
and more frequent trips. The couple, who live in Marlinton, W.Va.,
hope to retire at 55, about 20 years from now; he is a fiddle
player, poet and writer and she is a tree scientist for the Forest
Service.
</P>
<P>
   With that goal in mind, they both recently opened Roth
individual retirement accounts, and Van Gundy made the maximum
contribution to her government matching plan for savings.
</P>
<P>
   It was Shutterly, noting he was now paying more in taxes than he
had ever earned, who perhaps best summed up the winners' approach
to sudden wealth. Citing surveys showing that most Americans
believe 15 percent more income would make them happy, he said:
``I've got 15 percent for the rest of my life _ and perhaps years
beyond.''

<P>
   On primary night in New Hampshire, a shaken George W. Bush tried
to explain away his defeat by saying his rival John McCain had
spent far more time in the state than he had. Well, precisely:
Voters want candidates to circulate among them _ engaging the
issues, showing their mettle, thinking on their feet. If he is to
regain momentum in his campaign, Bush needs to emerge from the rose
garden and plunge into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain ran a high-minded campaign in New Hampshire,
especially compared to the snippy Democrats, and we hope that tone
continues. But a more open, accessible campaign need not be a
mud-slinging free-for-all.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not been reluctant to speak out because he is shy; his
scripted remarks are part of a considered strategy. The week before
the primary, a Bush aide told reporters traveling on the campaign
bus that he would no longer be holding open-ended press
conferences. ``It's not in our best interests,'' Mindy Tucker said.
``We have a message of the day, and we want to stick to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Discipline is an admirable quality in a candidate. But to date,
Bush has answered most of the questions posed to him with excerpts
from his stump speeches. Plenty remains unexamined.
</P>
<P>
   His fleeting references to health care make no mention of what
to do about the 42 million Americans who have no coverage, other
than advocating private medical savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   On abortion, Bush has refused to reconcile his support for the
Republican Party platform, which allows no exceptions for rape,
incest, or the mother's life, with his own position, which does.
</P>
<P>
   He has brushed off direct questions on Vladimir Putin,
contradicted his own statements on Saddam Hussein, and he won't
clarify what he meant when he called General Pervez Musharraf,
installed in a military coup in Pakistan, a reformer.
</P>
<P>
   American campaigns are crucibles; fiery tests intended to
strengthen the candidates. As the campaign continues, every
candidate, Bush included, must submit to the heat.

ENFORDING `DON'T HARASS'

<P>
   ``Don't ask, don't tell'' _ the policy to protect gays in the
military _ is six years old, but it is only now being backed by an
effort to do widespread, uniform training.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, announced by the US Department of Defense this week,
is impressive: The military will train all personnel within a year.
Because it comes so late, however, this training must be excellent
_ promoting change and making up for lost time.
</P>
<P>
   Even with ``Don't ask, don't tell'' in place, there have been
thousands of cases of gay service members being wrongly
investigated and harassed physically and verbally, including death
threats. Women who have reported sexual harassment have been
labeled lesbians and faced dismissal actions. Ideally, training
would make military personnel feel safer reporting all kinds of
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   A more heinous sign of the policy's failure came last summer at
Fort Campbell in Kentucky, where Private First Class Barry Winchell
was beaten to death with a bat by Calvin Glover, a soldier who
spent weeks harassing Winchell because he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Secretary of Defense William Cohen added ``don't
harass'' to the policy. Following up on this, the training will
emphasize that when a service member reports harassment, the goal
should be to investigate the harassment, not the sexual orientation
of the soldier. Officers and recruits alike will receive the
training, with periodic refresher sessions. For the training to be
effective, military leaders must be committed to it, explains
Michelle Benecke, co-director of the Servicemembers Legal Defense
Network. That means everything from confronting those who snicker
during training sessions to stressing basics. While ``don't ask,''
sounds like a simple directive, in 1998 the defense network
documented hundreds of cases in which service members were directly
asked if they were gay.
</P>
<P>
   Monitoring the training process and its outcomes will be
essential. Otherwise the effort will amount to little more than
good intentions.
</P>
<P>
   The military should not be hindered by wasted, discriminatory
fights among its own members. It has more important battles to
fight.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Aiming to put the worst week of his presidential
campaign behind him, Gov. George W. Bush returned to Austin on
Friday night with a fighting spirit _ and a blistering new attack
ad against his chief rival to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will meet with key advisers in Austin over the weekend to
discuss their aggressive new strategy _ crafted in the wake of his
surprising loss to Arizona Sen. John McCain in New Hampshire and
his dramatic drop in the polls in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the fire in his belly necessary to fight for and win
this nomination,'' said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer. ``I think
what you'll see is after this weekend, you're going to see the
governor come out charging.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the new tack can be seen in the ad Bush is running in
South Carolina in advance of that state's pivotal primary two weeks
from today. It accuses McCain of distorting the governor's tax cut
plan, and says the senator's own proposal seems to be the
inspiration of Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   McCain dismissed the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates are locked in a surprisingly tight race in
South Carolina, which was supposed to be Bush's protective
``firewall'' en route to the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   After McCain's 18-point victory in New Hampshire, fresh polls
suggest that Bush's once formidable lead in the southern state had
vanished _ and with it his aura of invincibility.
</P>
<P>
   The ad released late Friday came as Bush prepared to return home
after a long, painful stretch on the campaign trail. Fleischer said
the governor needed ``to recharge.''
</P>
<P>
   He downplayed the significance of today's meeting with campaign
officials, saying Bush routinely meets and discusses strategy on
weekends in Austin with his top aides.
</P>
<P>
   But several of the Republican's allies and advisers in Texas
said the campaign is long overdue for a wakeup call.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, ``You literally can't take a walk through the Capitol
or around it without seeing these little groups of Republicans
huddling about what's gone wrong out there,'' said one veteran GOP
strategist, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, he'll come back here, huddle and do some retooling
like they did after the debate fiasco, and they'll get it fixed,''
the strategist said. ``They really need to because South Carolina
could be make or break.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bush insider said the campaign is not panicking, but is having
to work overtime to restore the confidence of Bush's supporters
around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They immediately had to get on the phones and sort of calm
people that might have been wondering what the hell was happening
here,'' the insider said. ``There's nothing like a good snap of the
towel to get your attention, and this one was not only the snap of
a towel. The tip was wet and it was rolled up in a cattail and it
was snapped hard.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Tommy Merritt, R-Longview, one of many Texas
lawmakers who campaigned for Bush in snowy New Hampshire, said that
snap will help focus the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a panic now, but I did see an overconfident
organization up there,'' he said. Senior campaign staff members
``knew George Bush and his great leadership, but that did not
resonate in New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. David Sibley, R-Waco, also spent time in New
Hampshire. He said the campaign had long expected a one-on-one
fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got their work cut out for them in South Carolina,''
Sibley said. ``If McCain is now the front-runner, I hope the media
folk turn on him like they did on George.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bush is already acting like he's the underdog. At
appearances in Michigan, the governor sharpened his attacks on
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Taking aim at McCain's image as a campaign finance reformer,
Bush said it is ``important for the people to know that my friend
is raising money from people who have business in front of his
committee'' in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign said the attacks reek of desperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush, seeing his inevitability quickly fade, is
resorting to typical desperate tactics,'' said McCain spokesman
Howard Opinsky.
</P>
<P>
   McCain himself threw his own sarcasm-laced jab at Bush during a
rally in South Carolina on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush campaign 'hit a bump in the road,' '' McCain joked,
referring to Bush's description of the New Hampshire loss. ``I
think it tore out the transmission,'' The Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The latest dispute between Bush and McCain involves the economic
plans each has unveiled. Fleischer said the new Bush ad is designed
to counter McCain's TV ad claim that the governor would spend
``every last dime'' of his plan on rich-tilted tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are two different surpluses in Washington: one within
the Social Security trust fund, the other in the general treasury.
Neither McCain nor Bush propose using the trust fund surplus, but
the governor dedicates most of the other funds to tax cuts while
McCain dedicates them to bolstering Social Security and reducing
the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Bush decided against running a response to McCain's ad when it
ran in New Hampshire. Not any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was `above the fray' in New Hampshire and look what
happened,'' Fleischer said.

BUSH HEADS HOME FOR REST, STRATEGY MEETINGS

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Aiming to put the worst week of his presidential
campaign behind him, Gov. George W. Bush returned to Austin on
Friday night with a fighting spirit _ and a blistering new attack
ad against his chief rival to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will meet with key advisers in Austin over the weekend to
discuss their aggressive new strategy _ crafted in the wake of his
surprising loss to Arizona Sen. John McCain in New Hampshire and
his dramatic drop in the polls in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the fire in his belly necessary to fight for and win
this nomination,'' said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer. ``I think
what you'll see is after this weekend, you're going to see the
governor come out charging.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the new tack can be seen in the ad Bush is running in
South Carolina in advance of that state's pivotal primary two weeks
from today. It accuses McCain of distorting the governor's tax cut
plan, and says the senator's own proposal seems to be the
inspiration of Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   McCain dismissed the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates are locked in a surprisingly tight race in
South Carolina, which was supposed to be Bush's protective
``firewall'' en route to the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   After McCain's 18-point victory in New Hampshire, fresh polls
suggest that Bush's once formidable lead in the southern state had
vanished _ and with it his aura of invincibility.
</P>
<P>
   The ad released late Friday came as Bush prepared to return home
after a long, painful stretch on the campaign trail. Fleischer said
the governor needed ``to recharge.''
</P>
<P>
   He downplayed the significance of today's meeting with campaign
officials, saying Bush routinely meets and discusses strategy on
weekends in Austin with his top aides.
</P>
<P>
   But several of the Republican's allies and advisers in Texas
said the campaign is long overdue for a wakeup call.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, ``You literally can't take a walk through the Capitol
or around it without seeing these little groups of Republicans
huddling about what's gone wrong out there,'' said one veteran GOP
strategist, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, he'll come back here, huddle and do some retooling
like they did after the debate fiasco, and they'll get it fixed,''
the strategist said. ``They really need to because South Carolina
could be make or break.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bush insider said the campaign is not panicking, but is having
to work overtime to restore the confidence of Bush's supporters
around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They immediately had to get on the phones and sort of calm
people that might have been wondering what the hell was happening
here,'' the insider said. ``There's nothing like a good snap of the
towel to get your attention, and this one was not only the snap of
a towel. The tip was wet and it was rolled up in a cattail and it
was snapped hard.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Tommy Merritt, R-Longview, one of many Texas
lawmakers who campaigned for Bush in snowy New Hampshire, said that
snap will help focus the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a panic now, but I did see an overconfident
organization up there,'' he said. Senior campaign staff members
``knew George Bush and his great leadership, but that did not
resonate in New Hampshire.''
</P>

Howard Opinsky.

SUDDENLY, BUSH'S LEVEL OF DETERMINATION IS BEING QUESTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the past, when Gov. George W. Bush pondered
his astonishingly charmed political career, he sometimes described
the feeling of being propelled and kept afloat by forces that were
larger than he was. He once compared himself to a cork in a stream.
</P>
<P>
   It was an acknowledgment that he had managed to become the
governor of Texas without too much fuss or any previous experience
in office. It also remarked on the dizzying spectacle of watching
Republican king makers and money men beat a path to his door after
his landslide re-election in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in other words, has had it pretty easy. So his crushing
defeat by Sen. John McCain in the New Hampshire primary, after what
many Republicans call a half-hearted campaign there on Bush's part,
has led many political observers and Republican officials to wonder
how much they really know about the level of determination, energy
and humility that Bush can bring to this quest.
</P>
<P>
   Can he find the passion, inspiration and invention that a
pivotal juncture like this one requires? Can he regroup, retool,
hone a message that apparently did not resonate and find a tone
that is more commanding, and less merrily lackadaisical, than the
one he has used so far?
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are very real questions rooted in the nature of how all
of this came about,'' said Bruce Buchanan, a political science
professor at the University of Texas here. ``The governor did not
go out and build this possibility for himself in any kind of
dogged, persistent way of Bill Clinton or Richard Nixon, two
prototypes of people who decided they wanted to be president at the
age of 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's never been the case for this guy. An opportunity
presented itself, and he took it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the New Hampshire primary cast doubts on whether Bush _ or,
for that matter, his advisers _ were fully prepared to capitalize
on that chance. In the days leading up to the contest, Bush clung
to a confidence about the outcome that proved entirely unwarranted,
and he followed a schedule that was sometimes curiously
undemanding.
</P>
<P>
   He took midday breaks. He played in the snow for television
cameras. And he gave the impression of begin tired and homesick.
</P>
<P>
   ``They mailed in the campaign,'' said a Republican strategist in
Washington, D.C. ``They did an endorsement a day, and they went
sledding.''
</P>
<P>
   Even one of Bush's advisers acknowledged: ``I think he worked
hard in New Hampshire, but I think they were all surprised by how
hard he had to work. Until you do this, you don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than ever, Bush has to fight. And the signals of
whether he is up to the task _ indeed, whether he truly appreciates
the need for it _ are contradictory and inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   His public manner since he left New Hampshire has been
relentlessly upbeat. And even as polls showed that support in South
Carolina was flagging, he arrived there with an arsenal of
optimistic quips about shaking the snow off his suit, moving past a
bump in the road and onto a smooth highway and forsaking an alien
land for a patch of terra firma that was clearly ``Bush country.''
</P>
<P>
   He chalked up New Hampshire as an aberration, and so, too, did
some of his senior aides, almost all of whom have been with Bush
for the last five years in Texas and know him as a charismatic,
easygoing man who always rides high.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've never seen him lose,'' said one adviser, speaking of
this inner circle. ``Their first level of defense was, `It's just a
New Hampshire problem. Let's get out of here to the real world.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said in a private interview in Detroit Friday that
anyone who mistook his jocularity and stubborn optimism for an
inability to hunker down and fight was misreading him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake about it,'' Bush said emphatically. ``Not only
do I want to win, I'm going to win. I want to win bad enough to
win, and I'm going to win. You can mark it down in your book: On
this day, I told you, looked you in the eye, and said I'm going to
win the nomination, and I believe I'm going to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should not be lulled into a false sense about me, about my
competitive nature and my desire to lead this country.''
</P>
<P>
   There are external signs, too, that Bush is heeding the lessons
of New Hampshire. In the past two days, for instance, Bush has
significantly ratcheted up his criticisms of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   He began to question McCain's calls for more integrity in
government, noting reports in newspapers that the Arizona senator
sometimes received favors or campaign contributions from people who
appeared before the Senate Commerce Committee, which McCain chairs.
</P>
<P>
   He challenged McCain's claims that Bush's proposal for tax cuts
did not leave enough surplus money for Social Security, a charge
that he answered less aggressively in New Hampshire. In fact, the
Bush campaign began running a television commercial in South
Carolina Friday night that likened McCain to President Clinton and
other Democrats and labeled Bush the true conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``On taxes,'' the ad states, ``McCain echoes Washington
Democrats, when we need a conservative leader to challenge them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said more was
in store. ``I think you're going to see the fire in the governor's
belly when he comes out on Monday,'' Fleischer said. ``We are not
going to let Senator McCain again engage in the type of
misrepresentation of the governor's position he successfully
engaged in New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also began rounding out the economic thrust of his oratory
in New Hampshire with some of the broader themes he articulated all
through the first phase of his campaign last year _ like the
importance of personal responsibility, trying to diminish the
number of children born out of wedlock and encouraging youths to
stay off drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But he still seems to be hanging much of his campaign on the
promotion of a massive tax cut that polls suggest is not high on
many voters' list of priorities.
</P>
<P>
   And even in the wake of New Hampshire, he continued the parade
of endorsements. On Wednesday, in Greenville, S.C., Bush trotted
out former Vice President Dan Quayle. The gesture left some
political analysts scratching their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's friends and advisers say that none of this should be read
as complacency. But it remains to be seen if Bush can harness and
sustain the energy for what is shaping up to be a longer primary
fight than anyone originally envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   When Clay Johnson, Bush's gubernatorial chief of staff and his
lifelong friend, praised Bush's discipline in an interview, his
discription of how Bush structured his days was open to a less
flattering interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had two hard half days,'' Johnson said of Bush's
gubernatorial schedule. He said Bush began at 8:30 a.m., ended
around 5:30 p.m. and included 90 minutes to two hours of ``personal
time'' smack in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It requires a lot of discipline not to get sucked into a lunch
or a meeting or something,'' he said. ``But it's an inviolate part
of his routine, and so, be it a light lunch or exercise or whatever
it is, he insists on getting that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to do, as you can imagine. All my friends say
it's impossible to exercise. I say, how can the governor carve the
time out if you can't?''

COMMENTARY:   THE MCCAIN APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Every once in a long while the placid waters of the
Republican Party are roiled by an unruly character. At the turn of
the last century there was Teddy Roosevelt, in 1940 Wendell
Willkie. And now, John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The other candidates complain that the press likes Senator
McCain. True. Apart from his personal attributes, we naturally
prefer a dramatic story to a boring march toward the coronation of
George W. Bush. But it isn't just us. Americans really do not like
to be told, by pollsters and pundits and party insiders, that a
nomination is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   That was one reason for the smashing McCain victory in New
Hampshire. But there are other explanations for his appeal. To
begin with, there is the remarkable fact that the terrible years he
spent as a prisoner in North Vietnam did not leave him bitter. He
has a good time on the campaign trail. He makes politics fun.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many politicians, he has had a real life apart from
politics. He knows who he is and is comfortable in that skin.
</P>
<P>
   Teddy Roosevelt is his hero. Like T.R. and Willkie, he is a man
of gusto who does not mind discomfiting party regulars. But there
is a significant difference.
</P>
<P>
   T.R. and Willkie were liberal Republicans. Roosevelt bolted the
party in 1912 to run as the Bull Moose candidate. Willkie, a Wall
Street lawyer with no previous political experience, came out of
nowhere to win the nomination over the regulars on the sixth ballot
of a convention dominated by shouts from the galleries, ``We want
Willkie!''
</P>
<P>
   McCain is not really tied to either wing of the Republican
Party, the hard-back right or the dwindling moderates of the
Willkie stripe. His voting record is conservative. But he has an
open-mindedness that makes one think he would look at issues as
president without frozen ideological positions.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was helped greatly by Gov. Bush's unexpectedly dismal
campaign. He started with wide acceptance of him as a likable,
reasonable man _ and steadily frittered away that reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his campaign centerpiece huge tax cuts, totaling $1.3
trillion. As my New York Times colleague Paul Krugman has shown,
that would force savage reductions in government services. Even in
tax-averse New Hampshire, voters were unimpressed by the reckless
Bush proposal.
</P>
<P>
   He pretended he had nothing to do with the sordid maneuvers by
Gov. George Pataki and other Republican officials to keep McCain's
name off the New York primary ballot. Then, fearing more sympathy
for McCain after New Hampshire, he told them to stop their games.
</P>
<P>
   He doggedly opposed any limits on campaign finance, condemning
McCain's legislation to that end as ``unilateral disarmament.''
With the unprecedented sums he has raised himself, he appears as
the candidate of money.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most striking departure from expectations was Bush's
increasing identification with the Christian right. He took an
all-out stand against abortion. He refused to meet with the Log
Cabin Republicans, a gay group. He wore his own religious faith on
his sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   His first post-New Hampshire speech in South Carolina, where the
next big primary test comes, was at Bob Jones University, a
fundamentalist Christian institution with a racist past. He was
introduced as a man who ``deeply loves the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   The lunge to the right will not help Bush if he does win the
nomination. But first he has to stop McCain, and that will not be
so easy _ as McCain's quick gains in the South Carolina polls show.
</P>
<P>
   How does one attack John McCain? Steve Forbes showed the
difficulty when he issued this absurd statement: ``Senator McCain
is a genuine war hero. But he refuses to declare war on the
Internal Revenue Service.'' Bush's first ploy, to have someone
criticize McCain's support for diplomatic relations with Vietnam,
was equally pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   An effective presidency requires the ability to move others, and
McCain has still to demonstrate that quality _ to show that he is
more than a loner. But he has already achieved something. In a time
of ease, he talks about sacrifice and commitment. He reminds voters
that there is more to life than self-fulfillment.

 &HT;    Texas Board of Education trio takes aim at Bush
 &HT;    By A. Phillips Brooks
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In what some consider a suicide mission, two
current and one former member of the Texas State Board of Education
have weighed in on the GOP presidential campaign to criticize Gov.
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In a move orchestrated by challenger Steve Forbes, who sent a
private jet to whisk them to Iowa and New Hampshire, former board
member Donna Ballard questioned Bush's conservative credentials as
board member Bob Offutt (R-San Antonio) challenged the governor's
education record.
</P>
<P>
   This week, board member Don McLeroy (R-Bryan) joined his
socially conservative colleagues by warning in a letter that Bush
as president could mean more federal intervention in public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The actions by this trio, who have helped make the State Board
of Education one of the state's most contentious bodies, has some
questioning their political sanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are stepping on Superman's cape,'' said Jack Christie,
the board's former chairman, commenting on Bush's popularity among
most Texas Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But others view the move as symptomatic of the long-standing
problem Bush has had in courting the party's far right.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes campaign spokesman Bill Dal Col said Bush should expect
to see more Texans on the campaign trail taking aim at the
governor's conservative record.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to go find people in Texas, his home state, who
are either nonpartisan or conservative, saying `Wait a minute, the
story is not what (Bush) says it is,''' Dal Col said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Forbes campaign is showcasing Texan Mary C.
Williams in a political television ad, in which the Houstonian
asserts that Bush broke a no-new-taxes pledge signed during the
1994 gubernatorial campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott McClellan, a Bush spokesman, said such efforts won't
win votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think voters are tired of people trying to tear others down
and they're looking for someone who can bring people together. He
(Bush) has a proven record of bringing people together.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't appear to dissuade Ballard, the social conservative
who did what few Texas politicians in either party dared to do:
criticize Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Ballard _ who could not be reached Friday for comment _
admonished the governor to show leadership by withdrawing his
support from curriculum standards she called ``fuzzy fluff.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago in New Hampshire, Ballard repeated her criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me be clear,'' Ballard said. ``George Bush is no
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Offutt, who is running for re-election to the board this year,
joined in: ``The true record of Governor Bush on education in Texas
is one of broken promises,'' he said in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporters counter by pointing out that the rising scores
on state and national achievement tests are proof that Texas
students are doing better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Ballard and Offutt present a real threat to Bush depends
on who you ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``She comes across as sincere,'' Dal Col said of Ballard.
``Everyone believes they are absolutely sincere and that is what
makes it so powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the idea to recruit Ballard and Offutt was hatched by
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We approached them. We went out looking for people and found
each other through mutual contacts and they were willing to do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col said it's possible the two will also surface in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Bush officials and supporters said Forbes is spending a lot of
money for little in return, noting his unimpressive third-place
finish in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very clear none of this helped Steve Forbes,'' said Chase
Untermeyer, chairman of the Texas Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Christie called Ballard and Offutt shortsighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're hearing are the words of a defeated, disgruntled
ex-State Board of Education member,'' he said of Ballard, a
longtime nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   The feud between Ballard, Offutt and Bush dates back to 1995,
when Bush first took office. Bush passed over Offutt, the favorite
of social conservative board members, and appointed Christie, a
more moderate Republican, to head the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``From day one, they were out to damage him if he became a
significant force in national politics,'' said Richard Murray, a
political science professor for the University of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   While Ballard and Offutt may not do any deep and lasting damage,
their appearances put Bush in a squeeze play, Murray said.
</P>

   ``He is having to fend off challenges from both sides now,''
Murray said. ``If Bush ignores (Alan) Keyes and Forbes, trotting
out Ballard and Offutt, Forbes' share of votes might grow.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, board member McLeroy joined the Ballard-Offutt
chorus.
</P>
<P>
   ``All conservatives should be aware of the potential of Governor
Bush's proposal to extend more federal control to our schools,''
McLeroy stated in a widely distributed e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   When reached Friday, McLeroy clarified that he was talking about
Texas' widely acclaimed accountability system, which is credited
with raising student test scores but criticized for forcing
teachers to teach to the test.
</P>
<P>
   McLeroy softened his tone on Bush, however: ``I don't want to
bash the governor _ I mean gosh, the poor guy has got enough
trouble.''

CLINTON TO ASK FOR INCREASE IN ASSISTANCE TO INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the budget he will send to Congress on Monday,
President Clinton will propose increased spending to help
manufacturers who have been hit by competition from abroad and a
shortage of skilled workers at home, administration officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals have the backing both of organized labor and
manufacturing groups. They were developed, in part, at the urging
of Vice President Al Gore, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore is backed by most unions, he is at odds with
organized labor over his support for free trade and bringing China
into the World Trade Organization. Even so, the proposals could
help him show that he is sensitive to the upheaval that global
competition is creating among manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   In his budget, for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, Clinton
will propose an increase of $386 million in spending on a variety
of programs that could help manufacturers, administration officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the proposals is an increase of $215 million, or 26
percent, for the Export-Import Bank of the United States to help
promote exports.
</P>
<P>
   The others include $30 million in new matching grants to states
for training programs designed to help manufacturing workers keep
up with changing technology. Financing for a separate program to
give more science and math training to technicians would be
increased to $14 million from $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also propose a substantial expansion of programs
that monitor and enforce trade agreements, in particular those that
watch for rapid surges in imports from competitors selling their
goods below cost or taking advantage of big swings in exchange
rates. Industries like steel were hit hard by import surges after
the global financial crisis in 1997 and 1998, prompting calls from
manufacturers and from Congress for protectionist measures.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also call for expansions of existing programs to
help areas that lose factory jobs to foreign competition and for
more money for programs to help smaller manufacturers learn to use
the Internet to do business.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Smith, the director of public policy for the AFL-CIO, said
the proposals were ``all steps in the right direction'' but were
modest relative to the size of the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of
Manufacturers, said the White House had clearly recognized two
important issues, ``the move to e-commerce and the skills shortage
in America's work force.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Oman has agreed to accept the Russian tanker seized
by two U.S. warships that were enforcing U.N. sanctions against
Iraq, a Pentagon official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Oman is letting the Maritime Inspection Force escort the
Russian-flagged tanker, which is suspected of smuggling oil out of
Iraq, to one of its ports, where officials will await the results
of a laboratory analysis of an oil sample to determine its origin,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   If the results confirm that the oil is Iraqi, the official said,
Oman is most likely to dispose of it and release the ship, which
was intercepted on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian diplomats boarded the tanker Friday to ensure the crew's
well-being.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon also announced that the size of the inspection
force was doubled Friday, from two to four ships, adding that the
action was part of a customary rotation. The number of ships that
try to smuggle oil out of Iraq has reportedly risen dramatically
with the increase in oil prices. In the last year, 700 were boarded
and investigated, and 19 were seized.

2 LOUD NOISES PRECEDED ALASKA AIRLINES CRASH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT HUENEME, Calif. _ The crew of Alaska Airlines Flight 261
heard two loud sounds from the tail of the plane before it crashed
offshore here on Monday, the National Transportation Safety Board
reported Friday. The sounds probably mean that the crash was caused
by more than a simple jam of the horizontal control system.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve minutes before the crash of the plane, an MD-83 on a
flight from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco, with 88
people aboard, and long after the crew realized that there was a
problem with the horizontal control system, the plane ``experienced
an apparent loss of vertical control,'' said John Hammerschmidt,
the safety board member assigned to this crash.
</P>
<P>
   The cockpit crew recovered control in about a minute and a half,
he said, and as the plane flew on, ``a flight attendant advised the
crew that she had heard a loud noise in the rear of the aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The crew acknowledged that they had heard it too,'' he said.
From the sketchy description, it was not clear if the flight
attendant was on a telephone in the passenger compartment, or in
the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Hammerschmidt said, ``slightly more than one minute before
the end of the recording, a loud noise can be heard on the
recording, and the airplane appears to go out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators did not say how the sequence of the conversations
and the sounds, which could have been metal parts breaking,
corresponded with the transmissions to air traffic controllers or
the changes in altitude. But they have said that the crew was
discussing a problem with horizontal control when the tape began,
about 30 minutes before the crash. They have also said the pilot
and co-pilot appeared to have run through the troubleshooting
procedure in their flight manual and then to have consulted with
mechanics on the ground in Seattle and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The crew had told the mechanics that they had a ``runaway
stabilizer,'' and told air traffic controllers that they had a
``stabilizer jam,'' according to interviews that the safety board
has conducted with people on the ground. Both comments refer to the
part that makes up about two thirds of the horizontal tail, and is
used to set the plane's nose-up or nose-down attitude, for
climbing, cruising or descending.
</P>
<P>
   But a jam, in which the stabilizer will not move, or a runaway
stabilizer, in which it moves to its full limit of travel in one
direction, have occurred before.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of control and the recovery, along with the loud sounds
from the tail, hint that something more was occurring, according to
aviation experts. The sounds could indicate structural damage,
experts said, although investigators and other experts were
reluctant to speculate.
</P>
<P>
   More information will come from the flight data recorder, but
technicians in Washington did not begin working on that until
Friday. It contains about 25 hours of data, including two hours and
45 minutes of data from taxiing in Puerto Vallarta until impact in
the Pacific, when the plane was trying to make an emergency
approach to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Navy retrieved both the flight data recorder and the
cockpit voice recorder soon after the crash but will not begin
raising wreckage until robot submarines have finished viewing the
whole debris field, described as being about the size of a football
field, Hammerschmidt said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Several parts of the tail, including a piece of the vertical
tail with the Alaska Airlines logo, an Eskimo, are clearly visible,
he said.

PANEL RECOMMENDS REPARATIONS FOR SURVIVORS OF 1921 TULSA RACE

<P>
   TULSA, Okla. _ Nearly 80 years after this city erupted in what
many historians regard as the nation's bloodiest race riot, a state
commission Friday recommended reparations be made to the aged black
survivors who watched as people were shot, burned alive or tied to
cars and dragged to death.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary findings of the Tulsa Race Riot Commission are
expected to provoke a contentious debate in the Oklahoma
Legislature, which convenes Monday. The Legislature created the
commission more than two years ago to investigate a massacre long
obscured in history.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue of reparations is controversial. Many lawmakers
oppose any payments, and recent polls suggest that a majority of
residents share that opinion.
</P>
<P>
   A final decision on reparations may be many months away, at
best, and the commission did not estimate their cost. The
Legislature must first decide whether to extend the life of the
commission, whose term expires Monday even though it has not
completed a final report. But the commission's 7-4 vote in favor of
reparations was a firm statement that advocates hope will lend
moral weight to helping the riot's survivors.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legislature may not do what we think is the right thing,''
said Dr. Vivian N. Clark, a commission member. ``But the world is
looking at them, so whatever they do will reflect on the state of
Oklahoma.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The riot occurred in 1921, and while 40 deaths have been
documented, the commission's historian, Scott Ellsworth, has said
that interviews and records indicate that the actual death toll
could be as high as 300. In justifying reparations, the commission
noted that the attack far surpassed the 1923 massacre in Rosewood,
Fla., in which whites destroyed the small town and killed at least
six black residents. In 1994, the Florida Legislature provided up
to $2 million to compensate survivors. The commission also noted
that Congress authorized $1 billion to revitalize south central Los
Angeles after the 1992 riots.
</P>
<P>
   The workings of the Race Riot Commission have sparked a
remarkable and often uncomfortable period of introspection in
Oklahoma. For decades, the riots were never publicly discussed in
Tulsa, nor mentioned in classrooms or textbooks. Many younger
residents had no idea that thousands of whites burned the city's
once prosperous black community to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission has collected thousands of documents, many
found in attics or dusty file rooms. More than 1,000 elderly people
have called with information, and investigators have found 80
survivors, many of them elderly and infirm.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The commission's plans to excavate a section of a city cemetery
in search of a mass grave of riot victims was postponed by Tulsa
city officials last week because of bad weather and information
that suggested they might be looking in the wrong place.
</P>
<P>
   Two commission members, state Sen. Robert V. Milacek and state
Rep. Abe Deutschendorf, voted against the reparations resolution
because they did not think the wording should suggest that the
state, unlike the city of Tulsa, bears any culpability for the
massacre. Milacek said many lawmakers are likely to oppose
reparations for fear that allowing them could establish a precedent
for other communities to seek redress for past injustices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where does it end?'' said Milacek, a Republican, who said he
had agonized over the issue and considered the riot a blight on the
state's history.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Frank Keating, a Republican, has endorsed direct
reparations to survivors but expressed skepticism about broader
payments. In Friday's meeting, the commission recommended, among
other things, direct payments to survivors and descendants of those
killed, scholarships for students in the Greenwood district where
the riot occurred, the creation of an economic empowerment zone and
a monument memorializing the event.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, a subcommittee of the Race Riot Commission
recommended that $33 million be paid in reparations, an amount that
stunned the public. But Friday, the commission intentionally did
not recommend a dollar amount, deferring that responsibility to
lawmakers. However, the preliminary report that will be presented
next week does mention a figure of $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Don Ross, a Democrat who represents the Greenwood
neighborhood where the riot occurred, said he did not want the
Legislature to consider voting on reparations until a final report
was drafted.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ross plans to introduce a bill next week to reauthorize the
commission, and he said a final report will better establish the
historical record and more firmly determine culpability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't help but believe that if a compelling document is
delivered that the attitude of the Legislature will change,'' Ross
said. He added, ``There is no statute of limitations on a moral
obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Alfred L. Brophy, an Oklahoma City University law professor who
researched the reparations issue for the commission, said there was
a compelling legal and moral justification for reparations, even
though the historical record was incomplete. He said preliminary
research indicated that city officials at the time not only failed
to protect the lives of black residents but also contributed to the
riot by deputizing many members of the white mob that attacked
Greenwood. He also noted that promises to rebuild Greenwood were
never fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   The commission was created in 1997 by a law written by Ross, for
whom the attack has been a defining crusade. The commission is led
by Bob L. Blackburn, the chairman of the state historical society
and includes state lawmakers, historians, at least one survivor of
the riots and others with ties to the area. One survivor who has
served as an adviser to the commission is the historian John Hope
Franklin, who was a child at the time of the riot.

 &HT;    A Florida town roots for its star
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ray Lewis walked the mean streets of Lakeland, Fla.,
and got away. He was a lucky one. An NFL star and a millionaire
several times over. His jersey a hot item at his hometown's
sporting goods stores.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and neighbors can't understand what went wrong. They
refuse to believe that the Ray Lewis they knew could be housed in
an Atlanta jail cell, facing double murder charges. The same
disbelief permeates acquaintances and teammates in Baltimore, his
adopted home. His blue-collar work ethic and on-field
aggressiveness have made him a fan favorite and the Baltimore
Ravens' emotional leader on defense.
</P>
<P>
   This is their athletic hero, cloaked in Ravens purple. Back at
Kathleen High School in Lakeland, a life-size poster of the former
Class 4A state wrestling champion still hangs in the gym, part of a
shrinelike wall devoted to the school's top athletes. Football is
followed with a deep passion in Polk County, Fla., and Kathleen
High produces its share of talent. Two of Lewis' classmates also
earn their living in the NFL _ Torian Gray of the Minnesota Vikings
and Desmond Clark of the Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   `THEY DON'T THINK HE DID IT'
</P>
<P>
   ``He was our Joe Montana, our Babe Ruth,'' said Clinton Wright,
former principal at Kathleen High. ``We all looked up to him; he
deserved it. Where things went wrong, I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   just disturbing, difficult and hard to understand,''
Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright had an enjoyable dinner with Lewis last summer. It was an
evening for reminiscing.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers the star athlete as a good kid, having seen him
walk away from testy situations rather than get into a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible that he had joined a bad crowd? ``As you
associate, you become,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Joe Jr., his high school coach, flew up to one of Lewis'
Baltimore Ravens games in September. He was the same Ray Lewis.
Now, the old coach talks of flying to Atlanta as soon as he can, to
get the truth from Ray Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I'm carrying a burden with one of my own children,''
Joe said. ``I'm just hoping and praying that they bring this to a
conclusion. He's the greatest athlete I've ever coached.''
</P>
<P>
   At FanFair, a store in the Lakeland Mall that sells sports
apparel, Lewis' jersey is hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   His grandmother recently went in and bought eight.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis himself purchased 25 baseball caps.
</P>
<P>
   When news of his arrest broke Monday, customers were lined up
beneath a television that hangs from the store ceiling, mesmerized
as they watched details unfold on ESPN's ``SportsCenter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's reaction was the same,'' said assistant manager
Emmanuel McGill. ``They don't think he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   `HE JUST ATTACKS EVERYTHING'
</P>
<P>
   He has come too far to screw up. During his senior year in high
school, Lewis four times failed to get a qualifying SAT score and
turned off many college recruiters. During the summer, Lewis got
the score he needed and signed with the University of Miami, one of
the few schools that remained interested.
</P>
<P>
   When Lewis arrived on the Miami campus as a freshman weighing
barely 200 pounds, coaches told him he was too light to play middle
linebacker. But when starter Robert Bass was injured during his
first season with the Hurricanes, Lewis replaced him and had 17
tackles against Colorado in his first game. After his debut, Lewis
told reporters in his familiar scratchy, high-pitched voice: ``I
might be the greatest player ever to walk out of Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   And he did, leaving as one of the Hurricanes' most decorated
players for the National Football League after his junior year. He
was a consensus All-American in 1996 and led Miami in tackles 22
games in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray is a very aggressive person,'' said Auburn University
coach Tommy Tuberville, a former defensive coordinator at Miami.
``He just attacks everything. I guess this is not great (to say),
especially with the trouble he's in, but he didn't shy away. He
really was aggressive on the football field. No matter if the guy
he was trying to take on was 300 pounds or 180 pounds, he played
the same way _ full speed.''
</P>
<P>
   While at Miami, Lewis was known for his intensity on the field.
After his second season with the Hurricanes, he said he was
embarrassed at never having knocked anyone unconscious during a
game.
</P>
<P>
   He repeatedly said, ``I play like a dog. The ball is food. You
take food from a dog and he's going to chase you from sideline to
sideline to get it back. I know I will.''
</P>
<P>
   ENTOURAGE RAISES EYEBROWS
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens drafted Lewis as their 26th pick in the 1996 NFL
draft, only a few months after owner Art Modell moved his team from
Cleveland to Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   As a rookie, Lewis led the Ravens with 142 tackles. He had 210
in his second season, the highest total in the NFL, and was named
to his first Pro Bowl at age 22. Lewis was a Pro Bowl alternate
again in 1998 and was named a starter this season, before he was
arrested Monday and replaced by San Diego's Junior Seau.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a great practice player,'' Baltimore defensive
coordinator Marvin Lewis said. ``You know when he is not feeling
well because his whole demeanor changes in practice. You can tell
when he has a cold or is bothered by a muscle strain. Ray is a
leader. People attract to him. They did at the University of Miami,
they did from Day 1 here, even with the veteran players. Some
players don't want that responsibility. Ray does.''
</P>
<P>
   But privately, several members of the Ravens' front office were
worried that he had acquired an entourage that included bodyguards.
According to the Baltimore Sun, team officials planned to meet with
Lewis after he returned next week from the Pro Bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   CHARGES IN BALTIMORE
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was honored last Saturday night as the league's top
linebacker at a banquet sponsored by the NFL Alumni Association at
the Hyatt in downtown Atlanta. Lewis gave a brief speech after
accepting the award from Hall of Fame linebacker Willie Lanier.
``He thanked God and his teammates,'' said Frank Leistner,
controller of the alumni association.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying Lewis to the banquet was an African-American male
of about the same age, but Leistner said officials did not know his
identity. The association also provided Lewis a room for four
nights at the Renaissance Atlanta Hotel. Lewis and a cousin also
reportedly had a room at the nearby Georgian Terrace.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Highsmith, assistant valet manager at the Renaissance,
recalled a huge Lincoln Navigator limo fitting the description of
the one used by Lewis parked near the hotel last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has long been a lover of the night life and is no stranger
to the law, although he did not have a criminal record. An assault
charge was lodged Nov. 30 by a woman who accused him of striking
her in a Baltimore club.
</P>
<P>
   He still faces assault charges, but the prosecutor sought
postponement of the trial, set for Wednesday, after Lewis'
attorneys turned over witness statements indicating that he wasn't
party to the incident involving a 24-year-old woman. Catrice Parker
filed assault charges against Lewis and his longtime friend Eric
Carter, alleging that Lewis struck her in the face in the Windsor
Inn Lounge.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy State's Attorney Howard Merker said he is waiting for
Parker's attorney to provide witness statements before deciding
whether to prosecute. Merker said he is troubled by the description
Parker initially gave of her attacker: 5 feet 5 and 160 pounds.
Lewis is 6 feet and 240.
</P>
<P>
   Merker said he hasn't been contacted by Atlanta police about the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Pettit, Parker's attorney, said he is prepared to submit
at least four witness statements supporting the allegation that
Lewis struck Parker. As for the mistaken description of Lewis,
Parker said his client mixed up the descriptions of Lewis and his
friend Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``People indicate Ray Lewis was involved in the altercation with
the women ... and the exchange of blows,'' Pettit said.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said Lewis' friend started by shoving her, but she also
insisted that Lewis is the one who struck her in the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm watching TV and all his fans are upset, but everybody
needs to see him for what he is,'' said Parker, employed by a
Baltimore car dealer. ``I know he's violent, 'cause of what he did
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lews and four or five friends left the club in a black
limousine, Parker said. Merker confirmed the use of the limo but
said he doubted that it was the same one Lewis used in Atlanta.
`NOTHING LIKE ... A DADDY'
</P>
<P>
   At Miami, Lewis twice was investigated by Coral Gables police
after allegations of battery. Each incident involved a woman
pregnant with his child, and neither resulted in charges. One of
the women, Tatyana McCall, is the mother of two of his sons _ Ray
III, 4, and Rayshad, 2 _ and lives in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' own father was rarely home and eventually left Lewis'
mother, Sunseria Keith, who gave birth just after her 15th
birthday. The oldest of five children, Ray assumed the father
figure role in the family. He moved the family to Baltimore after
signing his first contract.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after entering Kathleen High, Lewis was given a copy of
the school record book and noticed that his father held several
wrestling records. ``So I put that book in my locker (and) I broke
every single record he ever owned, just so I could erase his name
from every place and replace it with my name,'' Lewis said before
the 1996 NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Grandparents Elease and Gillis McKinney helped raise Lewis in
Lakeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray was a happy child, but he was always running with older
boys, like he was looking for a role model,'' Elease McKinney said
in 1996. ``But there's nothing like having a daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   `RAY'S A GOOD GUY'
</P>
<P>
   Before stepping into a Lincoln Navigator limo last week for a
ride to Atlanta, Ray Lewis was living large on a contract worth $26
million. In May, he spent $753,000 on a home 15 minutes from the
Ravens' training facility in Owings Mills, Md. The upscale
neighborhood has been home to other sports figures such as
Baltimore Orioles pitcher Mike Mussina and catcher Charles Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Three men who described themselves as relatives answered a side
door on a recent afternoon, but they shed no light on what might
have happened last weekend in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't say anything about the incident,'' one said, refusing
to give his name. ``We've already been advised by attorneys not to
speak to anyone. ... Just make sure you say Ray's a good guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, Dave Kaiser described Lewis as a model
neighbor. The insurance consultant was stunned to learn that his
neighbor had been implicated in a gruesome double murder. Maybe the
money came too fast, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 24 and he's got $26 million,'' Kaiser said. ``Boy, that
is tough on somebody that age.''
</P>
<P>
   The home Lewis grew up in stands out in an otherwise blighted
neighborhood, but it is worlds from Owings Mills and the nearby
horse farms with such names as Belmont Farms.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the houses in the old Lakeland neighborhood are
small, one-story places, his grandmother's place is two stories,
bright with yellow siding. Few homes have much grass. Hers has a
spacious yard that almost glows green.
</P>
<P>
   Ameera Brewer is a neighbor. Brewer also is a sister of Kwame
King, a former Florida A&AMP;M University student wanted for
questioning in the Atlanta killings.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer said she knows Lewis and that the neighborhood reaction
is one of loyalty. ``He didn't do it,'' she said. ``He's innocent.
We're on his side.''

 TULSA, Okla.: the riot.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ross learned about the riot when a teacher mentioned it to him
as a young boy. He was infuriated and incredulous at the story. In
segregated Tulsa, the Greenwood community once had been a thriving
black business and residential district. It was nicknamed the
``Negro Wall Street'' and was home to 15,000 people and 191
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of May 30, 1921, a black shoe-shiner named Dick
Rowland and a white elevator operator named Sarah Page had an
encounter inside an elevator at the Drexel Building on Main Street.
Exactly what happened is not known, though the commission suggested
that Rowland may have accidentally brushed against Page. But a
scream was heard, and Rowland was eventually arrested on a rape
charge. He was released when Page refused to press charges.
</P>
<P>
   But the fuse for the riot had been lit. A white-owned newspaper,
The Tulsa Tribune, published an article with the headline, ``To
Lynch Negro Tonight.'' On May 31, an armed white mob arrived at the
courthouse to carry out the lynching. They were met by blacks who
had arrived to protect Rowland, and an ensuing gunfight claimed
several lives.
</P>
<P>
   The fight moved across the railroad tracks into Greenwood after
Tulsa police deputized a large number of whites, many of whom were
members of the Ku Klux Klan. The commission's final report is
expected to detail what happened, but this much is known: whites
set fire to buildings and homes, ultimately looting and burning
more than 1,200 structures. Klansmen reportedly raged through the
streets shooting people. Survivors told stories of corpses stacked
onto wagons and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   In the years that followed, the promised rebuilding of Greenwood
never happened. Instead, insurance companies refused to pay fire
policies, citing special riot exemptions. Whites ultimately took
over much of the land. Today, Greenwood is the site of the Oklahoma
State University-Tulsa campus, where the commission held its
meeting.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the audience, made up mostly of reporters, a few survivors
had come for the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Annie Beaird, 86, recalled the sounds of bullets and the sight
of black men rushing to defend their neighborhood. Beaird, who
breathed through an oxygen tube and was in a wheelchair, said
reparations are appropriate since her family's four-room house was
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they should give us something,'' she said. ``We lost
everything we had.''

 &HT;    A Florida town roots for its star
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ray Lewis walked the mean streets of Lakeland, Fla.,
and got away. He was a lucky one. An NFL star and a millionaire
several times over. His jersey a hot item at his hometown's
sporting goods stores.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and neighbors can't understand what went wrong. They
refuse to believe that the Ray Lewis they knew could be housed in
an Atlanta jail cell, facing double murder charges. The same
disbelief permeates acquaintances and teammates in Baltimore, his
adopted home. His blue-collar work ethic and on-field
aggressiveness have made him a fan favorite and the Baltimore
Ravens' emotional leader on defense.
</P>
<P>
   This is their athletic hero, cloaked in Ravens purple. Back at
Kathleen High School in Lakeland, a life-size poster of the former
Class 4A state wrestling champion still hangs in the gym, part of a
shrinelike wall devoted to the school's top athletes. Football is
followed with a deep passion in Polk County, Fla., and Kathleen
High produces its share of talent. Two of Lewis' classmates also
earn their living in the NFL _ Torian Gray of the Minnesota Vikings
and Desmond Clark of the Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   `THEY DON'T THINK HE DID IT'
</P>
<P>
   ``He was our Joe Montana, our Babe Ruth,'' said Clinton Wright,
former principal at Kathleen High. ``We all looked up to him; he
deserved it. Where things went wrong, I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just disturbing, difficult and hard to understand,''
Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright had an enjoyable dinner with Lewis last summer. It was an
evening for reminiscing.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers the star athlete as a good kid, having seen him
walk away from testy situations rather than get into a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible that he had joined a bad crowd? ``As you
associate, you become,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Joe Jr., his high school coach, flew up to one of Lewis'
Baltimore Ravens games in September. He was the same Ray Lewis.
Now, the old coach talks of flying to Atlanta as soon as he can, to
get the truth from Ray Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I'm carrying a burden with one of my own children,''
Joe said. ``I'm just hoping and praying that they bring this to a
conclusion. He's the greatest athlete I've ever coached.''
</P>
<P>
   At FanFair, a store in the Lakeland Mall that sells sports
apparel, Lewis' jersey is hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   His grandmother recently went in and bought eight.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis himself purchased 25 baseball caps.
</P>
<P>
   When news of his arrest broke Monday, customers were lined up
beneath a television that hangs from the store ceiling, mesmerized
as they watched details unfold on ESPN's ``SportsCenter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's reaction was the same,'' said assistant manager
Emmanuel McGill. ``They don't think he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   `HE JUST ATTACKS EVERYTHING'
</P>
<P>
   He has come too far to screw up. During his senior year in high
school, Lewis four times failed to get a qualifying SAT score and
turned off many college recruiters. During the summer, Lewis got
the score he needed and signed with the University of Miami, one of
the few schools that remained interested.
</P>
<P>
   When Lewis arrived on the Miami campus as a freshman weighing
barely 200 pounds, coaches told him he was too light to play middle
linebacker. But when starter Robert Bass was injured during his
first season with the Hurricanes, Lewis replaced him and had 17
tackles against Colorado in his first game. After his debut, Lewis
told reporters in his familiar scratchy, high-pitched voice: ``I
might be the greatest player ever to walk out of Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   And he did, leaving as one of the Hurricanes' most decorated
players for the National Football League after his junior year. He
was a consensus All-American in 1996 and led Miami in tackles 22
games in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray is a very aggressive person,'' said Auburn University
coach Tommy Tuberville, a former defensive coordinator at Miami.
``He just attacks everything. I guess this is not great (to say),
especially with the trouble he's in, but he didn't shy away. He
really was aggressive on the football field. No matter if the guy
he was trying to take on was 300 pounds or 180 pounds, he played
the same way _ full speed.''
</P>
<P>
   While at Miami, Lewis was known for his intensity on the field.
After his second season with the Hurricanes, he said he was
embarrassed at never having knocked anyone unconscious during a
game.
</P>
<P>
   He repeatedly said, ``I play like a dog. The ball is food. You
take food from a dog and he's going to chase you from sideline to
sideline to get it back. I know I will.''

   MITROVICA, Kosovo _ In the worst violence Kosovo has seen since
the end of the war, seven Albanians were killed and at least nine
wounded on Thursday night when about 500 people rampaged through
the streets, bursting into apartments, firing guns and throwing
grenades.
</P>
<P>
   The fierce fighting had subsided by daybreak, but the tension
remained in this divided city as angry crowds of Serbs and
Albanians gathered on either side of a bridge that spans the Ibar
River, which runs through the heart of this industrial city 30
miles northwest of Kosovo's provincial capital, Pristina. The river
separates the two communities; about 9,000 Serbs control the north
bank, and 90,000 ethnic Albanians live on the south side.
</P>
<P>
   French peacekeeping troops were forced to fire tear gas to
disperse about 500 rioters at the bridge. The violence erupted just
a day after two Serbs were killed and several others wounded in a
bus ambush. U.N. police officers said they had no doubt that
Thursday's attacks were in retaliation for the attack on the bus.
They said Serbs were trying to force Albanians living among them
out of the Serbian section of the town.
</P>
<P>
   The bus attack led Serbs to complain that the French soldiers in
KFOR, the NATO-led peacekeeping force, were not doing enough to
protect people. And that criticism only increased Friday as Serbs
and Albanians accused each other of causing the violence, with each
calling the peacekeeping forces ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday night's violence, a 13-year-old and her mother were
among the wounded at a Moroccan military hospital on the Albanian
side of the city. And a 16-year-old youth died of his wounds in the
hospital overnight, said a colonel in charge of the troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were walking the streets with weapons,'' said Jim
Brackett, an American police officer on duty outside an apartment
building that was attacked. ``There were explosions. Then the crowd
went berserk. They torched U.N. cars, they smashed one of ours.
There were six burning cars on the street, a house burning down
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officers worked until 5 a.m. evacuating the most
vulnerable Albanians and some international aid workers from the
north side of the city, Brackett said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the earliest attacks during the night occurred at a
Serbian cafe when an explosion hit the business, wounding 14 people
_ all Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Ten of the wounded lay in the intensive care ward of the
Serb-run hospital on the north side of the city, along with an
Albanian woman who had been shot.
</P>
<P>
   A cluster of worried relatives peered through the glass doors
into the ward at patients lying beneath rough blankets. One female
doctor was among the injured, having lost a leg in the blast,
doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   In the streets, an acrid smell and the shells of burned cars
were reminders of the rampage down the central avenue. At the end
of a side street stood the charred ruins of a house, also burned
during the night. Red curtains flapped at the blasted windows of
the cafe, a small brick building nearby. Inside, broken furniture
had been tossed around and the bar was splattered with blood.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers were investigating the scene of one murder in a
building on the same street where a woman had been shot dead in her
apartment. ``A Jordanian police officer was with her at the time,''
a U.N. policeman said. ``He was just getting up to go when a mob
burst open the door and shot her dead.'' The Jordanian officer was
unharmed but was evacuated with difficulty as armed Serbs took to
the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The night-long violence began when two Albanians were shot dead
at about 9 p.m., but police officers said they thought that the
overall violence was a reaction to a grenade attack on the bus
filled with ethnic Serbs. A senior U.N. police officer, who
requested anonymity, said: ``They threw hand grenades, there was
automatic gunfire, explosions. It was chaos, and complete
confusion.'' He said he did not know who was responsible for the
explosion in the Serb cafe, but he said no Albanian would have
dared venture out in the Serb district Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think Albanians were over here last night,'' he said.
``Most were hiding, they were terrified.'' He described the
situation for Albanians still in the Serb district as
``dangerous.'' Some were still refusing to leave; they were
barricaded into their apartments and would not even open the door
to the police.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As police officers conducted murder investigations in at least
five locations in the northern part of the city, they admitted that
they had not made any arrests during the night or Friday. ``We had
our hands full trying to get people out to safety and treating and
evacuating the wounded,'' Brackett, the American officer, said.
</P>
<P>
   French troops closed two bridges linking the divided city and
tried to help fleeing Albanians cross to safety. But the French
troops said they had had little success in dealing with the
violence. ``All I can say is thank God for the Dutch troops,'' said
a senior police officer who would not give his name. ``They came in
and they were great.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbs on the other side of the Ibar River were also scornful of
the French troops Friday. Two young electricians standing outside
the bombed cafe, Le Bel Ami, said that they were sure Albanians had
come from the south, crossing the nearby bridge. ``And where were
KFOR? Nowhere,'' said Ivan Savic, 18. ``KFOR do nothing, they only
help Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbs generally explained the violence as a night of Serbs being
under siege from attacking Albanians. Some warned that the
situation will only deteriorate. ``The Albanians will launch an
offensive against us and then we will bring in our own police, you
watch,'' said the other electrician, Dragan Radojkovic, 21.

RIGHTS AGENCY SAID TO BE STUDYING COMPLAINT AGAINST NEW YORK LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Md.)  (Eds: This story has been added to the Times' business dress
page.) 
(mk) 
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal civil rights agency is conducting an
investigation into how New York Life Insurance Co., the nation's
fifth-largest life insurer, treats its minority employees,
according to lawyers representing some of those employees.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
stems from several racial discrimination complaints the commission
has received from black and Asian managers in New York Life sales
offices in and around New York and Washington, said Steven J.
Hyman, a partner with the Manhattan law firm McLaughlin &AMP; Stern.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman said that he and his partner, Janet Neschis, have worked
closely with investigators from the commission's office in
Baltimore who have interviewed executives of New York Life about
the company's employment practices.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman said he believed that the seven cases he was handling
demonstrated a ``pattern of discrimination'' by the company of
favoring white managers over minorities when awarding top
management posts in sales offices.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the commission's investigation, William Werfelman, a
New York Life spokesman, said, ``We understand that EEOC activities
are confidential and we don't feel it's appropriate to comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Werfelman declined to comment on any of the individual charges.
Instead, he read a statement that said, ``New York Life has a long
record of commitment to equal opportunity. All job-related
decisions are based on qualification and merit. We believe a full
review of the facts will demonstrate that the company has conducted
itself according to its policies and procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Veldhuizen, deputy director of the commission in
Baltimore, said that she could neither confirm nor deny that the
commission was investigating New York Life. But, in December, the
director of the commission's New York office, Spencer Lewis,
signaled that an investigation of the company was being conducted
out of Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis notified Boswell Bent, who worked in a New York Life
office in Brooklyn, that the commission had changed its mind about
an earlier decision to dismiss his charge that he had been denied
promotions because he is black. Two years after telling Bent that
he was free to sue New York Life under federal civil-rights
statutes, the commission revoked his right to sue and referred his
complaint to its Baltimore office.
</P>
<P>
   New York Life, with about $90 billion in assets, is a mutual
insurance company owned by its policy-holders. It has about 7,400
employees and about 6,500 sales agents who are not employees.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been trying to keep some of the discrimination
claims out of federal court. But the company suffered a setback
Thursday when the U.S. Court of Appeals in Manhattan upheld a
federal judge's ruling that Marion Burns, a black employee in New
Jersey, could take his discrimination suit to court instead of to a
securities industry arbitration forum, as the company had wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Both Burns and Bent can now pursue their claims in federal
court, Hyman said, unless New York Life asks the court to
reconsider this week's ruling. Werfelman said the company had not
decided whether to seek reconsideration.
</P>
<P>
   Burns, who lives in Princeton Junction, N.J., contends that he
lost his position managing a New York Life office when the company
merged that office with another office in the state. The top job in
the combined office went to the white manager of the other office,
Burns contends.
</P>
<P>
   Neschis said that almost all of her clients' complaints had
arisen from mergers of offices managed by minorities into offices
managed by whites. The two charges filed with the Baltimore office
that triggered the EEOC investigation centered around demotions of
Asians when the offices they managed were merged with others.
</P>
<P>
   Su Liang Tran, a Chinese woman, and Farsad Baqir, a Pakistani
man, filed charges with the commission about four years ago,
contending that they were unfairly demoted from positions as
managing partners of New York Life offices in the Washington area,
Neschis said. The commission has not said whether it would pursue
their complaints or give them leave to sue the company on their
own.

PFIZER SAID TO BE NEAR $87 BILLION DEAL FOR WARNER-LAMBERT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN and LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After three months of bitter fighting, Pfizer Inc. is putting
the finishing touches on its deal to acquire Warner-Lambert Co. for
$87 billion, a union that will create America's largest drugmaker,
people close to the company said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products Corp., which had agreed to merge with
Warner-Lambert, told negotiators Friday that it would agree to go
away in exchange for a $1.8 billion fee _ an amount less than many
believed the company would be paid, but still one of the largest
breakup fees ever, the people said.
</P>
<P>
   Barring any problems over the weekend, Pfizer, the maker of
Viagra, and Warner-Lambert, the manufacturer of Lipitor, a top
cholesterol-fighting drug, are expected to announce their deal on
Monday. As with any negotiations, no deal is guaranteed. The boards
of all three companies are expected to vote on the deal by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer will exchange 2.75 shares of Pfizer stock for every
Warner-Lambert share.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Warner-Lambert were up $1.0625, to $94.5625 Friday on
the New York Stock Exchange; Pfizer shares gained 12.5 cents, to
$35.75, and Americn Home stock was down $2.1875, to $45.50.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement that American Home had signed with
Warner-Lambert in November, American Home was to be paid $1.8
billion if another company swooped in to buy warner-Lambert. But
American Home was trying to get more than that amount.
</P>
<P>
   American Home also held certain stock options that prevented
Pfizer or any other suitor of Warner-Lambert from using a favorable
accounting method known as pooling. This week all three companies
have been grappling with how to pay American Home more than the
$1.8 billion breakup fee, without jeopardizing Pfizer's ability to
use the favorable accounting.
</P>
<P>
   Several different solutions were discussed, people close to the
talks said, including Pfizer's selling American Home the rights to
a pharmaceutical product that Pfizer or Warner-Lambert was
developing or to an existing over-the-counter product. But Pfizer
executives worried that the Securities and Exchange Commission
could view that as a payment to American Home for canceling its
option to buy 14.9 percent of Warner-Lambert's stock, the people
close to the talks said. The SEC could then force Pfizer and
Warner-Lambert to use another method of accounting that would
significantly reduce the combined company's profit for many years.
Pfizer did not want to take the risk, these people said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, John R. Stafford, American Home's chairman, said he
would agree to drop the stock option so that Pfizer and
Warner-Lambert could use pooling accounting, the people said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision leaves American Home Products at the altar for the
third time in two years. But this time, the spurned bride is $1.8
billion richer. And, many analysts say that American Home will
quickly find a new partner because of the many promising drugs it
is developing or has just put on the market.
</P>
<P>
   American Home, however, must first find a way to solve the
thousands of lawsuits now pending against it by people who contend
that they were hurt by taking the drug combination known as
fen-phen.
</P>
<P>
   The union of Pfizer and Warner-Lambert will create a
pharmaceutical giant that is the top seller of drugs in the United
States and the second largest pharmaceutical seller in the world,
based on last year's statistics. Only Glaxo SmithKline, the company
created by Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham, which announced
intentions to merge last month, would be larger.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether the mergers could cause drug prices,
which consumers already complain are too high, to rise even more.
The companies plan to use their greater size to negotiate better
deals with HMOs and other large drug buyers.
</P>
<P>
   But some stock analysts said Friday that they did not believe
consumers would be affected. ``There is still a great deal of
competition in the drug industry,'' said Steven B. Gerber, a
pharmaceutical analyst at CIBC World Markets.
</P>
<P>
   Gerber said that instead it was the smaller drug competitors
that might be harmed by trying to compete with the huge sales
forces and research budgets of a combined Pfizer and
Warner-Lambert. ``It is getting tougher and tougher for these small
companies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   William C. Steere Jr., Pfizer's chairman, is expected to be
named chairman and chief executive of the new company, which has
yet to announce its name. And Henry A. McKinnell, executive vice
president at Pfizer, is expected to be president of the company.
Lodewijk J.R. de Vink, the chairman of Warner-Lambert, was offered
a transitional role, but as of Friday it was not clear if he would
accept.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 4, Warner-Lambert agreed to buy American Home for $70
billion in stock. But hours later, Pfizer made a hostile $82.4
billion offer for Warner. Warner spent three months fighting that
bid, and the companies filed many lawsuits against each other. It
is expected that those suits will now be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Warner-Lambert and Pfizer was testy
from the start. In interviews last November, de Vink said that
negotiations between American Home and Warner-Lambert began last
July. But as the two companies were putting the finishing touches
on their merger agreement in October, de Vink got a letter from
Steere suggesting the two talk. He agreed.
</P>
<P>
   De Vink met with Steere on Oct. 27 at Steere's offices at Pfizer
headquarters in New York, and the two discussed a possible
combination. The talks were vague, de Vink said then, and he later
called Steere and told him he was not interested because of ``the
size differential and the fit is not in the best interest of the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   When Pfizer made its hostile bid, it also sued American Home and
Warner to dissolve certain anti-takeover provisions, including the
breakup fee, which Steere then called ``egregious.'' Warner-Lambert
countersued saying the hostile offer violated the marketing
agreement it had with Pfizer regarding Lipitor. The two companies
were set to go to court in nine days.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Warner-Lambert agreed to negotiate with Pfizer, in
part, because of shareholder pressure. But at the same time it
sought a white knight, including the consumer giant Procter &AMP;
Gamble, which last week backed out of talks with Warner and
American Home. Left with few options, Warner decided to negotiate
an agreement with Pfizer.

LEARNING TO THINK SMALLER AT COKE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6)

c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Coca-Cola, Roberto C. Goizueta remains a legend, the chief
executive whose vision and drive transformed the giant company into
a global power. For his successor, M. Douglas Ivester, mastery of
the inner workings of the Coke system could not make up for an
uninterrupted streak of falling profits and personal faux pas.
</P>
<P>
   Now the corner office at Coke is to be occupied by Douglas N.
Daft, a cheerful, unassuming Australian who spent 30 years rising
through the ranks. Practically a stranger in Atlanta, because of
his overseas postings and constant travel, in just a few weeks he
has turned the world of Coca-Cola upside down.
</P>
<P>
   He announced a plan to push worldwide decision-making at the
company down to the local level _ a plan requiring the layoff of
6,000 workers, including nearly half of those at Coke headquarters
in Atlanta. He said the company would embrace local brands and
flavors more than it had in the past. He conceded that Coke could
not meet its long-term targets for earnings growth and acknowledged
that profits had been eroded by bad investments and bad management.
</P>
<P>
   The stock _ for most of the last decade as iconic as Coke's
brand _ has been in a tailspin since, closing on Friday at $56.25,
down $6.8125 since the layoffs were announced on Jan. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Daft, 56, is executing his own plan or one he merely
helped to create is not clear. Coke's board is known to have grown
more frustrated and demanding over the last year; for his part,
Daft radiates a kind of shock that it is his turn to run the
world's best-known soft-drink company.
</P>
<P>
   But the changes he is putting in place surely reflect his view
of the way a global company ought to operate _ a view developed
through a series of assignments in Asia, where he learned the hard
way what sold Coca-Cola, and what didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it was so natural and logical,'' Daft said in an
interview in New York last week, reflecting on the way his
restructured Coca-Cola will let local managers make decisions about
products, advertising and other functions that previously were
controlled from Atlanta. ``It's something I've always lived by.''
</P>
<P>
   Daft _ now Coke's president, and scheduled to succeed Ivester as
chairman and chief executive on April 19 _ takes over as the
company is discovering the flawed underpinnings of the global
expansion model that enshrined the late Goizueta in the business
pantheon.
</P>
<P>
   Goizueta, Coke's chief executive for 16 years until his death in
1997, long maintained that the company could instill a craving for
products like Coca-Cola and Sprite all over the world, from the
foothill shantytowns of Venezuela to the boulevards of Paris and
Berlin. Goizueta's early successes in emerging markets, in
particular, fueled strong growth at Coke and made it one of Wall
Street's best-loved stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, Coke has had to come to terms with a conflicting
reality. In many parts of the world, consumers have become pickier,
more penny-wise, or a little more nationalistic, and they are
spending more of their money on local drinks whose flavors or brand
names are not part of the Coca-Cola lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The company took an $813 million charge for the costs of
carrying poorly performing assets in Russia and the Baltics last
year, and more charges are expected for similar investments in
India.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had the world's greatest brand, and they believed that by
the mere fact that Coke was Coke, they could sell it,'' said
Michael Bellas, chief executive of Beverage Marketing, a consulting
company. ``It worked in the good times.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the company's worldwide bottler system _ Goizueta's
brainchild, Ivester's handiwork and the envy of competitors like
PepsiCo _ faltered as regional economies fell apart, and many
bottlers fumed that Coke was greedily profiting at their expense by
raising concentrate prices. Along with its dismal earnings news
last month, the company disclosed that bottlers in some key markets
had too much soft-drink concentrate on hand, suggesting to some
analysts that Coke had stuffed the pipeline to meet its own volume
targets.
</P>
<P>
   The bleak performance left Coca-Cola looking more vulnerable as
its once impeccable public image was stained by crises _ from the
biggest product recall in company history to a racial
discrimination lawsuit filed by a group of its black employees. The
company has run afoul of regulators in Europe, Mexico and Australia
over its plan to acquire the Cadbury Schweppes brands and over
marketing practices like giving incentives to retailers to sell
Coke instead of competing products. Then there was the vending
machine that Ivester admired for its ability to raise prices
automatically in hot weather.
</P>
<P>
   From an investor's point of view, Coke was broken. But now there
is a New Coke _ no, not (italics)that(end italics) New Coke, but
the restructuring plan devised over the last six months by Daft and
others. The huge layoffs are meant to clear the way for Coke to
become a quicker company, a marketer better attuned to customers
and other constituents.
</P>
<P>
   The central bureaucracy that reacted so clumsily when children
in Belgium said they felt sick after drinking Coke products last
spring has been pruned to its bare essentials; the company says it
expects to be more responsive to political and social concerns.
</P>
<P>
   And Coke will sell more kinds of soft drinks, catering to local
tastes for a change. ``They were ignoring the local flavors for
years,'' said Bill Pecoriello, a beverage analyst for Sanford C.
Bernstein. ``The opportunities were always there. Now they've put a
structure in place to go after them.''
</P>
<P>
   While trying not to criticize his predecessor, Daft conveys his
belief that Coca-Cola dropped the ball more than a few times. Asked
what happened in Belgium, where Coke was perceived as arrogant and
uncaring because of its slow response, he said: ``Maybe there was
no one there who understood the environment. Or, if we had people
who understood the environment, we didn't listen to them.''

 &HT;    Limo driver's testimony led to arrest
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa and Janet Frankston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Testimony from the driver of the now-famous stretch
limousine that spirited Ray Lewis from a bloody Atlanta crime scene
led police to charge the NFL star with two counts of murder.
</P>
<P>
   An arrest warrant and affidavit signed against the middle
linebacker was solely based on testimony given to Atlanta police by
limousine driver Duane Fassett, investigators with Atlanta's
Criminal Investigations Division said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, one of the men wanted for questioning about the
stabbings of Jacinth Baker and Richard Lollar _ A.J. Johnson _
denied he had ever ridden in the limousine Lewis was known to rent
regularly. Police said the 40-foot-long vehicle was seen speeding
from the corner of the crime scene the morning after Sunday's Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Ray said I was in the car, he's a damn liar. I know he
didn't say that,'' Johnson said Friday outside his apartment in
Laurel, Md. ``I've never, ever been in the Navigator limo. I've
never been in any Navigator limo. I never rode in that car.
Never.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he has no idea why police are linking him to the
murders. ``They haven't left a message on my phone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kwame King, a high school football teammate of Lewis' who is
also wanted for questioning, was said by family members in
Lakeland, Fla., to be in Atlanta cooperating with police.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police spokesman John Quigley would not confirm if
police were talking to King on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta homicide investigators arrived in Baltimore on Friday
morning, but Johnson said police have not contacted him. Johnson
said he had a Super Bowl party Sunday night with his fiancee,
Theresa Chin-Loy, and three other people. He added: ``I ain't done
nothing. I've never been to (Atlanta) to party. I don't know what
the limo looked like.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who played football at the University of Maryland, said
he met Lewis through a friend who plays on the Ravens, but said he
does not know him well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never rode with him,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm curious how my name got out.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he only knows Lewis well enough to exchange
greetings.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I was his friend, I would tell you I was his friend,''
Johnson said. ``Who wouldn't want to be Ray Lewis' friend?''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he is planning to coach high school football
someday and is worried that his name is being sullied. He said he
is looking forward to talking to police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell them I'm here. Whenever they get ready to come for me,
I'm here. I can't tell them nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, meanwhile, said the limo driver, employed by All
Stretched Out Limo in Baltimore, was the first and only solid
witness thus far to give police any statements.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett's friends and attorney have told reporters Fassett
insists Lewis is had no role in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Fassett probably does not understand Georgia
law and is not aware a person can be charged with a crime even if
they did not directly commit it, but were present and aware of it.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta detectives would not elaborate, but said the murder
charges could have stemmed from the fact that Lewis ``was there, he
knew what happened and he never called police,'' investigators
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Lewis) was the last witness to come forward,'' an Atlanta
Criminal Investigations Division detective told a reporter Friday.
``The longer you wait to call police, the worse it is.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday afternoon, one of Lewis' attorneys _
Jana Harris _ said witnesses had told the defense team Lewis was
seen ``sheparding people into the limousine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The witness said Lewis had some knowledge of what happened and
was saying `C'mon let's go,''' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris criticized Atlanta homicide investigators for arresting
Lewis and charging him with murder based on the testimony of one
witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only charging document we have from police at this
time,'' Harris said waving the two-page document before reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who works with attorney Ed Garland, said her office has
several private investigators working on the case. The Baltimore
Ravens also have hired a private investigator, who is a former
Atlanta police officer.
</P>

NO LONGER GRAY AREA: BUSH OPPOSES STATUE

<P>
   DETROIT _ Gov. George W. Bush said Friday he opposes a
Confederate statue proposed for Grimes County in East Texas, ending
almost two weeks of silence on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they ought to have the Confederate, the statue,
on the courthouse grounds,`` Bush said during a presidential
campaign stop in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a month, Bush has been under scrutiny on the
presidential campaign trail for dodging questions about the
Confederate symbolism, starting with the Confederate battle flag,
which flies atop the South Carolina capitol.
</P>
<P>
   While blacks decry the flag as a symbol of racism, Bush has said
the decision is a states' rights issue for South Carolina
residents.
</P>
<P>
   But for almost two weeks, Bush has sidestepped similar questions
in his home state.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Grimes County residents has raised more than $30,000
for a 6-foot bronze statue of a Confederate infantryman, whose
rifle would be replaced with a Confederate flag four times a year.
</P>
<P>
   The statue, supported by a majority of the county Commissioners
Court, would be placed facing south on the west side of the tiny
courthouse grounds in Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed statue has attracted opposition from black
ministers in Grimes County and from a group of Texas legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has oversight of the final decision because he appoints
members of the Texas Historical Commission, which must approve the
statue.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, amid persistent questioning about the statue, Bush
finally let his feelings be known while touring the Marvin L.
Winans Academy of Performing Arts in Detroit with black ministers.
</P>
<P>
   The publicly funded charter school abuts the Perfecting Church,
where Marvin L. Winans is pastor.
</P>
<P>
   When first asked his position on the statue, Bush responded,
``That will be resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked a second time, he said: ``The county has yet to apply.
We'll see how they apply.''
</P>
<P>
   As the ministers watched Bush being interviewed, the candidate
responded, ``I don't think they ought to have the Confederate, the
statue, on the courthouse grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not indicate why he opposed the statue.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Texas, praised Bush for opposing the
statue. Earlier this week, Ellis and seven other legislators signed
a letter asking the historical commission to oppose the statue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor recognizes that symbols of hate have no place in
21st-century America,'' Ellis said Friday. ``I hope he will join
our effort to remove other symbols of hate on display across our
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dal Dreher, commandant of the Grimes County Greys, a chapter of
the national organization Sons of Confederate Veterans, declined to
comment about Bush's statement.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said his organization will proceed with its efforts
to win approval from the historical commission.
</P>
<P>
   Dreher said he was upset that the issue had turned into a
national political topic, criticizing the Houston Chronicle for
dragging Bush into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not fair because it put an unfair burden on us in
Grimes County,'' Dreher said.
</P>
<P>
   The historical commission has not received a direct request for
the statue, which must come from the Grimes County Commissioners
Court.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission has already given an indication it opposes
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   In a Nov. 16 letter to Grimes County Judge Ira E. ``Bud''
Haynie, a commission staffer criticized the proposal because the
statue would clutter the small courthouse's grounds. The 1894
building is somewhat of an island, with just 15 feet of land
between it and a surrounding road.
</P>
<P>
   The staffer suggested the statue be placed in a nearby park,
which offers more space.
</P>
<P>
   The state has control of all changes to the Grimes County
Courthouse and its grounds because it paid for a major renovation
of the three-story building.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Haynie said the county would make the
application with the historical commission. He did not return calls
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Grimes County Commissioner Zac Falkenbury said he was unsure
how the issue will be resolved or whether commissioners will make
an application for the statue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing has gotten into such turmoil and become such a
problem,'' he said. ``I wish it could go away. This being a
political year, the Democrats and Republicans are using it against
each other.''

 &HT;    Limo driver's testimony led to arrest
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa and Janet Frankston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Testimony from the driver of the now-famous stretch
limousine that spirited Ray Lewis from a bloody Atlanta crime scene
led police to charge the NFL star with two counts of murder.
</P>
<P>
   An arrest warrant and affidavit signed against the middle
linebacker was solely based on testimony given to Atlanta police by
limousine driver Duane Fassett, investigators with Atlanta's
Criminal Investigations Division said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, one of the men wanted for questioning about the
stabbings of Jacinth Baker and Richard Lollar _ A.J. Johnson _
denied he had ever ridden in the limousine Lewis was known to rent
regularly. Police said the 40-foot-long vehicle was seen speeding
from the corner of the crime scene the morning after Sunday's Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Ray said I was in the car, he's a damn liar. I know he
didn't say that,'' Johnson said Friday outside his apartment in
Laurel, Md. ``I've never, ever been in the Navigator limo. I've
never been in any Navigator limo. I never rode in that car.
Never.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he has no idea why police are linking him to the
murders. ``They haven't left a message on my phone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kwame King, a high school football teammate of Lewis' who is
also wanted for questioning, was said by family members in
Lakeland, Fla., to be in Atlanta cooperating with police.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police spokesman John Quigley would not confirm if
police were talking to King on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta homicide investigators arrived in Baltimore on Friday
morning, but Johnson said police have not contacted him. Johnson
said he had a Super Bowl party Sunday night with his fiancee,
Theresa Chin-Loy, and three other people. He added: ``I ain't done
nothing. I've never been to (Atlanta) to party. I don't know what
the limo looked like.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who played football at the University of Maryland, said
he met Lewis through a friend who plays on the Ravens, but said he
does not know him well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never rode with him,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm curious how my name got out.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he only knows Lewis well enough to exchange
greetings.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I was his friend, I would tell you I was his friend,''
Johnson said. ``Who wouldn't want to be Ray Lewis' friend?''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he is planning to coach high school football
someday and is worried that his name is being sullied. He said he
is looking forward to talking to police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell them I'm here. Whenever they get ready to come for me,
I'm here. I can't tell them nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, meanwhile, said the limo driver, employed by All
Stretched Out Limo in Baltimore, was the first and only solid
witness thus far to give police any statements.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett's friends and attorney have told reporters Fassett
insists Lewis is had no role in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Fassett probably does not understand Georgia
law and is not aware a person can be charged with a crime even if
they did not directly commit it, but were present and aware of it.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta detectives would not elaborate, but said the murder
charges could have stemmed from the fact that Lewis ``was there, he
knew what happened and he never called police,'' investigators
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Lewis) was the last witness to come forward,'' an Atlanta
Criminal Investigations Division detective told a reporter Friday.
``The longer you wait to call police, the worse it is.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday afternoon, one of Lewis' attorneys _
Jana Harris _ said witnesses had told the defense team Lewis was
seen ``sheparding people into the limousine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The witness said Lewis had some knowledge of what happened and
was saying `C'mon let's go,''' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris criticized Atlanta homicide investigators for arresting
Lewis and charging him with murder based on the testimony of one
witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only charging document we have from police at this
time,'' Harris said waving the two-page document before reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who works with attorney Ed Garland, said her office has
several private investigators working on the case. The Baltimore
Ravens also have hired a private investigator, who is a former
Atlanta police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Johnson said he learned about the double murder on
the news. He said it was snowing and several friends could not
attend the Super Bowl party at his apartment. He also said he was
home Saturday night watching a Mike Tyson fight and ``The
Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand this. I had class (at 6 p.m.) on Monday. I
wasn't going down to Atlanta and partying if I had class on
Monday.''

 UNDATED: the them.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Late last year, the demonstrations during the World Trade
Organization meeting in Seattle drove home the point that global
companies like Coke are viewed with growing hostility by some
groups. The critics are especially irritated by what they regard as
the multinationals' belief that the world should play by their
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumer democracy is becoming more and more of an issue,''
said Carl Ware, Coke's executive vice president for communications
and corporate affairs. ``We have to address it on a local basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it the next wave of globalization, or the natural byproduct
of the consumer culture that Coke helped build up around the world.
``They finally see the light,'' said Jerry Wind, a marketing
specialist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania,
adding that other companies, including Procter &AMP; Gamble, have been
quicker to respond to local markets. ``The world is heterogeneous.
You have local preferences and tastes. It makes a lot of sense for
them to acknowledge the regional or local differences and try to
manage their franchise as a portfolio of products that try to cater
to different segments.''
</P>
<P>
   The light first came on for Daft when he was assigned to
Indonesia in the early 1970s. His job was to sell Coca-Cola, lots
of it. ``I launched Coke and I pushed Coke for three years,'' he
recalled. ``Then I launched Fanta,'' an orange soda, ``and the
business just tripled and quadrupled.'' The lesson? ``Brand Coke is
the core of our company, then you add on to that the volume that
you generate by competing in a wider market.''
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent stints in Hong Kong and Japan, and a lot of time
spent building Coke's business in China, taught him the value of
relationships, of quick decision-making, and of that thing called
face time that he says is still key in business. When he was made
group president for Asia but posted to Atlanta in 1991, ``that just
meant I had to travel all the time,'' Daft said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be in a place in order to understand it,'' he
explained. ``You've got to give attention to people. You've got to
be able to see the people within the organization and outside the
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing so revolutionary there, but it was not the Coke way.
``We had backups in Atlanta in case people failed,'' he said,
``monitoring them, constantly checking on information and receiving
information.'' That was not so helpful to new product development _
or to morale. A local manager who wanted to shift advertising
dollars from one Coke brand to another, for example, had to wait
for clearance from Atlanta before doing so.
</P>
<P>
   And the global ``mind-set,'' to borrow a term from Ivester's
lexicon that Daft rarely utters, had its drawbacks. Bottled water
was a recent example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking for a worldwide strategy for water slowed us down,''
Daft says now. Most Americans consider bottled water an occasional
luxury; Europeans cannot live without it. ``You can't apply a
global standard of measurement to consumers,'' Daft says, ``because
it reduces everything to the lowest common denominator.''
</P>
<P>
   Coke settled on a plan that required bottlers to buy packages of
mineral additives for its Dasani brand water, which is being
marketed across the United States; another Coke water, Bonaqua,
continues to be sold abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Daft has also pledged to help improve returns for Coke bottlers.
``I think it's very positive,'' said Morris Strickland, area
manager for Coca-Cola Enterprises in Jackson, Miss. ``The focus is
right. I was at a meeting in Atlanta and I felt more unified with
the Coca-Cola Co. than I have in a long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   If Daft's ideas are different, so is his personality. Goizueta
was charming until crossed. Ivester was great with numbers but not
necessarily with people. Daft is universally described as
even-tempered and comfortable with stressful situations. A healer,
perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fellow is the right man at the right time at the right
place,'' said Donald R. Keough, the former president of Coke who is
now chairman of Allen &AMP; Co., the New York investment bank whose
president and chief executive, Herbert A. Allen, is a member of
Coke's board. Daft, he said, ``can be surgical'' in his
decision-making, but is also easygoing, a combination Keough said
he valued in a leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to have a lot of fun with it, when all is said and
done,'' Keough said. ``To be a dour, uptight person selling
Coca-Cola is a contradiction in terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Daft's conciliatory side was in evidence in one of his first
acts upon becoming president on Dec. 6: retaining Ware, the
company's highest-ranking black executive, who to the consternation
of civil rights leaders in Atlanta had announced his resignation
after a management shuffle left him outside the chief executive's
circle.
</P>
<P>
   Ware changed his mind, he said, after talking with Daft about
his plans for the company. ``We had an agreement that much of what
we had done in Africa and in Asia could be replicated in other
parts of the world,'' Ware said. ``He's open to ideas from a whole
lot of sources. He has encouraged dialogue, encouraged debate,
encouraged everyone to have an opinion, no matter what the issue
is.'' Daft also moved swiftly to name a second in command, Jack L.
Stahl, a concept Ivester had resisted.
</P>
<P>
   Other colleagues who have worked closely with Daft say he is
quick to decide what needs to be done, but steps back to allow
subordinates to make up their minds about how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very careful about delineating his point of view, but at
the end of the day it's: You live here, you're accountable, you
make the decision,'' said Stephen C. Jones, who was the No. 2
executive in Japan and was recently appointed by Daft as chief
marketing officer for Coke.
</P>
<P>
   On trips they took around Japan, Daft embraced the local culture
more deeply than Jones did, particularly in restaurants. ``I
avoided the sea urchin,'' Jones said, ``but he orders it.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan has turned out to be Coke's most lucrative market,
accounting for 20 percent of the company's profits _ about $1
billion last year, on just 5 percent of its overall volume. It is
also the place where, under Daft's direction, Coca-Cola has gone
farthest in encouraging local brands that suit local tastes. In
Japan, Coke's most popular product is a canned coffee, closely
followed by canned teas.

 UNDATED: canned teas.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Keeping that market profitable will be a chore. Coke has the
largest share of the Japanese cola market, but sales have been hurt
lately because Japanese consumers consider other drinks healthier.
And the Japanese market is also going through a major shift;
increasingly, sales are centered on retail and discount stores
rather than on vending machines, where the profit margins are much
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Keough, for one, thinks Daft can handle the issues he will face.
``Wherever there was a place where there was a problem, there he
went, and guess what, there was no problem,'' he said of Daft's
record in Asia. ``And you didn't get any six-page report about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The child of a shoe-store owner in Cessnock, New South Wales,
Daft joined Coke's planning department in Sydney in 1970, after
brief stints as a high school teacher and a computer analyst for an
oil company. He was soon sent to Indonesia for a year, which turned
into five. In 1975, he left Coke to start a chain of liquor stores
in Australia with a friend.
</P>
<P>
   A year later he was back at Coke, assigned to Hong Kong as a
marketing manager. He moved to Singapore in 1981, and returned to
Hong Kong in 1984 to oversee Coke's business in China for four
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In China, I really learned the value of relationships and
understanding political agendas, and there was a real need to
understand that you sold and marketed to consumers on a local
basis,'' Daft said. ``In a country that large, with that many
people, you would really miss a lot if you tried to generalize.''
</P>
<P>
   China was one of Coke's fastest-growing markets in the 1990s.
But last spring, after American warplanes bombed the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade _ an act the United States calls an accident _
sales fell off as anti-American sentiment focused on Coke,
McDonald's and other American companies in China. Daft quietly
arranged to spend an evening at the theater in New York with
China's deputy ambassador to the United States, hoping to smooth
some of the anger.
</P>
<P>
   Daft is said to closely follow changing tastes, not only in soft
drinks but also in pop culture, something that he may owe to his
26-year-old daughter, Alexandra, who lives in Portland, Ore., and
22-year-old son, Nicholas, a senior at Williams College.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, he held an annual conference for his Asian
managers in Park City, Utah. The days were spent in business
discussions, the nights spent viewing films like ``Big Night'' and
``When We Were Kings'' ahead of the rest of the country, since Daft
timed the conference to coincide with the Sundance Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Let's meet for eight hours a day, and then go out at
night to see how independent people are telling stories these
days,''' Jones recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Daft's biggest challenge may be persuading Wall Street the
company has righted itself and is positioned to grow. One concern
is that there may be more bad news to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're looking at not only this year as a year of
recovery, but also part of next year,'' said Marc Cohen, a beverage
stocks analyst at Goldman Sachs. ``It could take 12 to 24 months
before they hit their stride.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the problems yet to be fully aired is India, where costly
writedowns are expected to be detailed before long. And the plans
to sell more soft-drink brands tailored to local tastes will not be
so easy to put into place, Cohen said; new brands take time to
develop, and few are likely to be as profitable as Coke itself.
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances give Daft at least a chance to come out a
corporate hero. If Ivester succeeded a legend, taking control of
the company when Coke was riding high, Daft has been handed a
Coca-Cola at half-staff, with Goizueta's shadow fading. The market,
and his board, will demand results, but the expectations may be
easier to manage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there is a remarkable recovery in economic growth
beyond what people foresee at the moment, this will be a case where
they gradually build momentum,'' Cohen said. ``As they iron out the
significant challenges the company has come to face in the last few
years, we should expect them to produce better performances. What
remains to be spelled out is, how much better?''

   SUNDANCE-FILMS (Park City, Utah) _ This year's Sundance film
festival, which ended its 10-day run here a week ago, was widely
viewed as among the most successful of recent years with fresh and
surprising entries in all of the festival's categories. By Rick
Lyman. (Moved). &QL;

<P>
   FRENCH-WOMEN-FILMS (Undated) _ The French, a stubborn people,
may be the last nation on earth for who the ``magic'' of women is a
simple, unshakable article of faith. The French Institute/Alliance
Francaise in New York is currently conducting a kind of revival
meeting devoted to reasserting this durable tenet of the national
religion (i.e., the cinema) in the form of a 10-film tribute to
Carol Bouquet, Sandrine Bonnaire and Juliette Binoche. Strictly
speaking, these women have little in common. But if you compare
them with American actresses of similar accomplishment (say, Julia
Roberts, Meg Ryan and Michelle Pfeiffer) you can't help noticing
that the Frenchwomen are, collectively, a much graver and more
mysterious bunch. By Terrence Rafferty. (Moved). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DOROTHY-ARZNER-FILMS (Undated) _ Three days into the last
century, the wife of a San Francisco cafe owner gave birth to a
child who would grow up to be the lone female filmmaker of
Hollywood's golden era. Dorothy Arzner will not receive a fraction
of the tributes accorded that other recent centenarian, Alfred
Hitchcock. But Arzner warrants a place in film history, and not
simply because she broke into the super-macho profession that movie
directing was in the '30s and '40s. Looked at today, Arzner's films
are startling in their pre-feminist probings of women's place in
American society. By Graham Fuller. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL;

<P>
   CHINA-ZHANG-FILMS (New York) _ The first six films by the
Chinese director Zhang Yimou had a strong structuring device in the
stunning form of Gong Li, China's best-known actress. From their
debut feature, ``Red Sorghum'' (1988), through the international
hits ``Ju Dou'' (1990) and ``Raise the Red Lantern'' (1991), to
``The Story of Qiu Jiu'' (1992) and ``To Live'' (1994), Zhang was
involved personally and professionally with Ms. Gong. But during
the production of ``Shanghai Triad'' (1995), she terminated the
relationship, and, within a year, married a wealthy Singaporean
businessman. Filmmaker and performer have not collaborated since.
His first two post-Gong Li efforts, the urban comedy ``Keep Cool''
(1996) and the rural drama ``Not One Less'' (1999), are departures
for Zhang. That ``Not One Less,'' which opens here on Feb. 18, took
the Golden Lion for best film at the 1999 Venice Film Festival

   KATHLEEN-MARSHALL-DANCE (New York) _ In her three and a half
years as the artistic director of the Encores musical concert
series, the choreographer Kathleen Marshall has become something of
an expert in the fine art of instant entertainment. Productions at
Encores, after all, rarely rehearse for more than 10 days before
showing off the results for 3,000 spectators a night at City
Center. So imagine her surprise last fall when she found herself
working on the revival of ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' a project two years in
the making whose rehearsal schedule stretched out over six weeks, a
period unthinkable for any Encores veteran. By Jesse McKinley.

   BLACK-DANCE (New York) _ The arts organization 651 ARTS, which
was founded in part by the Brooklyn Academy of Music and identifies
itself as an African-American performing arts presenter, will
feature a dance program called ``Black Dance: Tradition and
Transformation'' that runs Feb. 16 through 19 at the BA M's Harvey
Theater, the headquarters of 651. The new yearly series will
examine the past, present and future of black choreography with
performances, master classes, lectures and discussions. By Jennifer

   BRAZILIAN-DANCE-TROUPE (New York) _ Since the Brazilian
choreographer Deborah Colker established her dance troupe in Rio de
Janeiro in 1994, it has attracted enormous audiences. Her sleek,
14-member Companhia de Danca Deborah Colker makes its North
American debut at the Joyce Theater Feb. 15 through 20 with the
full-evening work ``Rota'' (``Route''), a hit in South America and
Europe that has been seen by more than 200,000 people since 1997.

<P>
   JAPANESE-DANCE-TROUPE (New York) _ You've probably heard that
you can't put your elbow in your ear. Well, don't tell it to H Art
Chaos, an all-female dance group from Japan. A seeming hybrid of
Pilobolus and Gumby, these 11 hyperlimber women have complete
disregard for the laws of physical possibility: they hang from
their heels, pirouette at whiplash speed, writhe convulsively on
the floor, launch themselves violently into the air and
occasionally fly around the stage carrying chairs and sometimes one
another. This apotheosis of energy can be experienced Tuesday
through Sunday at the Joyce Theater in ``Secret Club _ Floating
Angels 2000,'' a highly theatrical 80-minute work, much praised in
Japan, that has been evolving since 1993. By Annette Grant.

   DUBLIN-CAROL-THEATER (London) _ ``Dublin Carol,'' is an
impressive new play by Conor McPherson, 28, the Irish author of
``The Weir.'' Partly because of its own undoubted quality, partly
because the earlier work has enjoyed such success in London and New
York, this is the piece that was to have reopened the Royal Court
Theater, which has been closed for nearly four years for a
$40-million-plus refit. But the most reliable member of any team of
British contractors is the gremlin. Building problems have caused
delays, and delays have temporarily banished Ian Rickson's
sensitive production of ``Dublin Carol'' to the Old Vic. By

   JANE-EYRE-THEATER (London) _ What is left to discover about
``Jane Eyre'' after at least four film versions and various
important critical writings, not to mention Charlotte Bronte's 1847
novel itself? If you are in the theater, perhaps it is the
opportunity to physicalize the book while animating its
time-honored passions anew. That seems to be the case with Polly
Teale, the adapter and director of Shared Experience's stage
production of the novel that arrives on Tuesday at the Brooklyn
Academy of Music in New York. By Matt Wolf. (Moved). &QL;

   ONE-MINUTE-MUSIC (New York) _ How little does it take? How much

the Miller Theater not long ago. I went to Livingston's recital
hoping for revelation. Could the tiny gesture yield the big
statement? Not here, I am afraid. Most of these pieces, despite the
performer's protestations, took their mission as a joke. Some were
amusing, and the few with furrowed brow never quite justified their
serious intent. Maybe the composers were not good enough, or maybe
a minute is not enough. By Bernard Holland. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL;

   MUSIC-COMPANIES-MERGERS (Undated) _ It's not even Valentine's

Music, owned by Seagram along with Universal's movie and television
companies, swallowed Polygram in 1998, and late last year Time
Warner announced plans to merge with America Online. Then, in
January Time Warner announced it intended to take control of EMI
Music. Meanwhile, reports continue to circulate that BMG is
negotiating to buy Sony Music. That eventuality would swiftly halve
the number of major recording companies, from six in 1998 to three
by 2001. By Jon Pareles. (Moved).  &QL;

   KIDS-IN-THE-HALL (Toronto) _ Five years after their
sketch-comedy show, ``The Kids in the Hall,'' went off the air,
Mark McKinney, Dave Foley, Scott Thompson, Bruce McCulloch and
Kevin McDonald have reunited for an 18-city tour of the United
States and their native Canada. During those years a strange thing
has happened: these cult comedians seem to have become quasi-rock
stars, with enough fans to fill a 2,600-seat Toronto theater for
three nights, a 4,000-seater in Chicago and seven sold-out shows at

organization formed by demobilized officers in the years following
World War I and involved in everything from intelligence gathering
to archaeology to parapsychology, constitute a compelling if little
known slice of history. Among the expeditions the corps
scrupulously recorded in panoramic photographs and firsthand

   JETLAG-PLAY-ARCH (New York) _ Others may care about parallel
universes, black holes or the possibility of punching through our
local space-time configuration into past or future states. What
matters to me is the challenge of punching into the present. This
trick is harder to pull off than one might think. But Elizabeth
Diller and Ricardo Scofidio, the New York architects, have been
performing it, with increasing success, for nearly 20 years. Two
recent projects, both realized in ephemeral forms, have expanded
the New York audience for the work of these gifted space-timers.

There was little of the sexual drama of the far more successful
``N.Y.P.D. Blue.'' And the show's time slot, Friday night at 10,

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bonnie Cashin, one of the first designers to create
and popularize that uniquely American approach to dress called
sportswear, died Thursday after open heart surgery at New York
University Medical Center. She was 84 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Cashin was one of a handful of women in the 1940s and 1950s who
made an important contribution to American fashion, at a time when
Parisian couturiers dominated the runways and supplied most of the
original fashions for manufacturers to copy. The breakthroughs
achieved by Cashin and designers like Claire McCardell, Vera
Maxwell, Anne Klein and Anne Fogarty still influence the way women
dress, and paved the way for the success of American designers like
Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan and Calvin Klein.
</P>
<P>
   Renowned for her loose-fitting sportswear, Cashin described her
unstudied, casual designs as ``articulating with the body.'' She
was an early proponent of layering _ using several layers of light,
fluid clothes, rather than one heavy garment. She pioneered the use
of grommets in place of buttons and was the first important
designer to make ponchos for women, introducing lightweight capes
and ponchos that, she explained, ``didn't look like a horse should
wear them.''
</P>
<P>
   As far back as 1943, she showed boots with tweed suits and
included them in almost every subsequent collection. Her
``pocketbook'' pocket, with a snap closing, was another feature
that long distinguished Cashin designs. She was ahead of her time
when she introduced canvas raincoats in 1952, industrial zippers in
1955, jumpsuits in 1956 and suede Indian dresses with fringes in
1957.
</P>
<P>
   She opened her own business, Bonnie Cashin Designs, in 1952 and
for the two ensuing decades also designed leather, jersey, canvas
and tweed clothes for Philip Sills. In addition, she created
handbags for Coach Leatherware, gloves for Crescendoe-Superb and
rainwear for Modelia. In the early 1970s, she branched out into
knitwear with styles knitted to shape, rather than cut and sewn,
and with welt hems instead of traditional hems or ribbed cuffs. A
popular innovation was a roomy turtleneck that did not require a
zipper to get over the head.
</P>
<P>
   Although her themes were often adopted by other designers,
Cashin clothes had a look of their own. Her tweed ponchos were
bound in leather, and her coats had a special, supple swing. For
several years, there were Cashin departments in chic Paris and
London stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women buy Cashin clothes because they are cozy and
comfortable, not because they bowl people over,'' the fashion
writer Bernadine Morris wrote in The New York Times in 1968.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Her gloves had many of the same features as her clothes.
Grommets were arranged in the back of one style so that the glove
could almost have served as a set of brass knuckles. Brass toggles
not only were ornamental but also held a pair of gloves together or
attached them to a belt. Some had drawstrings at the top that could
be tightened to keep out the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Her classic designs for Coach in the early 1960s were the
shoulder bag and what was called the Basic, a smaller clutch style
with a removable shoulder strap. The first bag she designed, a
leather carryall modeled after paper shopping bags, was later
discontinued but has since become ubiquitous in the collections of
numerous handbag companies.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Cashin was intolerant of anything ugly, in appearance or design.
When she traveled, she draped lengths of Thai silk in her hotel
rooms and ordered quantities of flowers. She was also generous on
the road, dispensing items in her wardrobe to anyone who admired
them. She usually returned with a different wardrobe from the one
she had packed, not only because she had given away her clothing
but also because she was interested in acquiring fashion ideas from
other countries.

<P>
   ``Travel is my education,'' she said in a 1961 interview with
Charlotte Curtis in The Times. ``Even if I don't use an idea right
away, it's there.'' The idea of layering came from time she spent
in Asia. ``The Japanese refer to cold weather as a nine-layer
day,'' she explained in 1950. ``Hot is a one-layer day.''
</P>
<P>
   One of her best-known innovations was the ``dog leash'' skirt,
which came about because she was constantly holding her skirt going
up steps in her country home in Briarcliff, N.Y. The long wool
skirt could be instantly shortened by latching a small brass ring
sewn near the bottom to a small brass clasp at the waistline.

<P>
   Cashin was born on Sept. 28, 1915, in Oakland, Calif., the
daughter of Carl Cashin, a photographer and inventor, and Eunice
Cashin. The family lived in several towns in northern California
during Cashin's early years, and in each her mother would open a
custom dress shop. As a child she was given fabric scraps as
playthings and soon began sewing and designing.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before her graduation from high school, she showed some
of her sketches to the director of a Los Angeles ballet company and
was hired to make costumes for the next performance. After
graduation, she joined the company as its designer and in 1934
accompanied the manager to New York when he took over the Roxy
Theater. Not yet 20, she created three costume changes a week for
each of the variety theater's 24 dancers.
</P>
<P>
   She often called her Roxy experience her ``formal schooling in
design'' and credited it with her later ability to create clothes
that looked good on figures in motion. The theater also propelled
her into designing street clothes, initially a collection of
sportswear for Adler &AMP; Adler, a manufacturing concern.
</P>
<P>
   After the United States entered World War II, she was appointed
to a committee to design uniforms for women in the armed forces.
But the war also imposed restrictions on the civilian use of
fabrics and trim. She returned to costume design, which had more
leeway with fabrics, and moved to Hollywood. There, she joined 20th
Century Fox and created the clothes for some 60 films, including
``A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,'' ``Laura'' and ``Anna and the King of
Siam.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Cashin enjoyed the work in Hollywood, explaining: ``I wasn't
designing for fashion, but for characteristics, which is the way I
like to design clothes for daily wear. I like to design clothes for
a woman who plays a particular role in life, not simply to design
clothes that follow a certain trend, or that express some new
silhouette.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   She remained in Hollywood until 1949, when she returned to New
York. Her casual, layered clothes struck a responsive chord in
American women. Within three years, she had won the first of her
Coty Awards and organized Bonnie Cashin Designs.
</P>
<P>
   Cashin was also chosen the first designer for Patterns of The
Times, American Designer Series, a monthly feature in The New York
Times during the 1950s that made designer patterns available for
home sewing.
</P>
<P>
   She was inducted into the Coty American Fashion Critics Hall of
Fame in 1972 after receiving her second Coty Award in 1968. Her
designs are in more than a dozen museums and some 30 university
collections.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   She was among the designers highlighted in the 1998 Metropolitan
Museum of Art Costume Institute exhibition ``American Ingenuity:
Sportswear 1930s-1970s.'' A retrospective of her work is scheduled
to open in September at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, she established the Innovative Design Fund awards, a
nonprofit organization based in New York that gave up to $10,000 to
designers with original ideas in home furnishings, textiles and
fashion so they could transform their sketches into marketable
products.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   During her early design years, she was married briefly to Robert
Sterner, an art director. They were later divorced. She is survived
by her longtime companion, Curtis Kellar.

2 MAKERS OF GOLF BALLS IN MARKET-SHARE WAR

<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ The golf ball wars are on.
</P>
<P>
   Barely had Callaway Golf Co. introduced its new premium balls
here Friday before a prime competitor, Taylor Made-adidas Golf,
slammed back.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies, while popular makers of premium golf clubs, are
new to selling balls, a more lucrative business that is dominated
by Titleist, made by Fortune Brands.
</P>
<P>
   Callaway's two new balls represent a costly $170 million
investment that takes the company well beyond its basic club-making
business.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling to maintain a tiny 3 percent share of the $1.5
billion worldwide golf ball market, Taylor Made officials put their
own ball to the test in a comparison with Callaway's on a live
satellite feed to a press conference at the opening here of the
annual PGA Merchandise Show.
</P>
<P>
   In a robotic test run by an independent firm paid for by Taylor
Made, both Taylor Made's top line ball and Callaway's new balls
were smacked 80 times. The Taylor ball outdistanced Callaway, on
average, by about four yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we making a competitive ball?'' asked Dick Rugge, vice
president for production at Taylor Made. ``It's not competitive. It
goes beyond. It is superior.''
</P>
<P>
   The war over Callaway's new balls upset other ball-makers that
are guarding their turf in a once-torrid industry that has slowed
markedly in the last couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real dogfight out there,'' said James R. Craigie, chief
executive of Spalding Sports Worldwide, which makes the Top Flite
brand and trails just behind Titleist. He complained that Callaway
was giving little information about the makeup of its new product.
</P>
<P>
   Ely Callaway, the 80-year-old founder and chief executive of the
company he named after himself, shrugged off the criticism from
rivals over his new balls, which come in soft or firm and will sell
for $44 for a box of 10, a price that compares to others in the
premium category.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we know there is a lot of complex science that goes into
making a golf ball,'' Callaway said, ``we don't think there should
be a lot of complexity to buying one.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Callaway introduced a line of oversize drivers
called Big Berthas that sold in huge quantities despite a price as
high as $500 each _ well above nearly all other golf clubs. Now
Callaway hopes to duplicate that success in making balls.
</P>
<P>
   Though close-knit and concentrated around the small town of
Carlsbad, Calif., the golf equipment industry is not without its
testy differences. Two years ago, Spalding introduced a line of
balls for the Big Bertha and was immediately sued over copyright
infringement by Callaway. They eventually settled their differences
out of court. Meanwhile, Callaway also sued Taylor Made after one
of its top executives left to run the rival company, a case that
was recently settled as well.
</P>
<P>
   Titleist, which leads the ball industry with a 32 percent market
share, was reluctant to talk about Callaway. ``We withhold judgment
for now,'' said Ed Abrain, executive vice president of Titeist,
which also makes Pinnacle balls and last year sold 20 million boxes
of a dozen balls each.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeff J. Christensen, business director of Wilson Sporting
Goods, was not so reluctant. ``Any time you have a new entry, it
means a battle for market share,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles J. Yash, president of Callaway, said it took three years
to develop the new balls and build a manufacturing plant near the
company's headquarters in Carlsbad. The company will spend more
than $8 million in advertising on its new Callaway Rule 35 balls
(so named after the 34 detailed rules that set firm limits on the
size, specifications and performance of golf balls) and several
million dollars more on promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Yash, who joined Callaway after holding executive positions at
Spalding and Taylor Made, discounted all the detailed production
information and comparison figures on the packaging of competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set out to cut through noise on the performance claims by
most of the competitors' products,'' Yash said, ``and all of the
techno-babble about various polymers and compressions and dimple
patterns and claims regarding the longest distance balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Yash did not disclose the number of new balls that will be
manufactured this year, but analysts estimate that Callaway could
sell up to $50 million worth, giving it about 3.5 percent of the
market and roughly matching Taylor Made's current share.
</P>
<P>
   Both Callaway and Yash sought to allay concerns on Wall Street
that Callaway was still struggling to recover from its slump. It
achieved sales of $714.5 million last year, up $17 million from
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Yash said a pretax loss of $38.4 million was caused by the $170
million investment in the new golf ball business. He said the
company expected pretax losses to diminish but continue this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Far from easing off as the U.S. economic expansion was becoming
the longest in history, the nation's employers added more jobs in
January than in any other single month in more than two years _
drawing in people who had given up looking for work and easing the
struggle of millions of workers to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   The January increase of 387,000 new jobs was the biggest jump
since September 1997, when employees of United Parcel Service,
returning from a strike, swelled the count to 408,000, the Labor
Department reported Friday. The unemployment rate ticked down
another notch, to 4 percent, the lowest level in exactly 30 years.
It had been 4.1 percent since October.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street saw the January employment numbers as fresh evidence
of a rising inflation rate, if not right away, then by early spring
_ the concern being that a shortage of workers forces employers to
pay higher wages and then to raise prices to cover the added labor
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These latest numbers do not give any evidence of the slowdown
in the economy that many of us had been expecting in the new
year,'' said Edward McKelvey, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs.
``The next set of inflation numbers may be low, but the forces we
are seeing threaten to push inflation higher soon.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the employment report, bond traders pushed up
interest rates mildly out of concern that strong employment will
eventually result in higher inflation unless the economy slows. In
pushing up rates, they reversed course after having driven down
rates all week. They had been in a turmoil over the Clinton
administration's plan to shrink the national debt faster than
expected. As the debt shrinks, so does the number of Treasury bonds
issued by the government to finance the debt. That prospect had
people rushing to buy bonds while the supply lasted. The demand
drove up bond prices and drove down the interest rates that the
Treasury must pay to get people to buy its bonds.
</P>
<P>
   But while Wall Street saw inflation in the employment report,
the Clinton administration saw stability, and also the danger that
rising rates _ pushed up too quickly by bond traders and the
Federal Reserve _ could water down the economic boom in an election
year. The Fed raised short-term interest rates Wednesday by
one-quarter of a percentage point and warned of ``heightened
inflation pressures in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, however, insisted in an interview
Friday that the labor market, despite the low unemployment rate,
was not inflationary. ``We cannot continue to have these quick
reactions to the employment numbers; we have to take the long
view,'' she said. ``This is a strong economy that is in balance
with a significant pool of people available to take on more work.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman argued that a fluke drove up job growth in January. Of
the 387,000 jobs created in January, nearly half _ 169,000 _ were
the result of an unusual spell of warm weather in mid-January, just
when her department was taking its monthly job survey, she said. As
a result, construction jobs rose by 116,000 rather than a more
normal 18,000 for January, and there were similar spikes in
industries related to construction _ landscape gardening, for
example, and the manufacture of plywood and concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Take away the 169,000 and job growth in January was only
218,000, Herman insisted. That is still too much, Wall Street
economists said. The economy can average a maximum of only 150,000
new jobs a month and still avoid an unacceptable rise in the
inflation rate, said Chris Varvares, a partner at Macroeconomic
Advisers Inc., a St. Louis, Mo., forecasting service.
</P>
<P>
   Job growth averaged 234,000 a month last year, an unusually high
level of job creation for an expansion that became 107 months old
this week, the longest in history and one month older than the
1960s expansion.
</P>
<P>
   If all these new jobs are inflationary, the evidence is missing
from the Labor Department's wage data. The average hourly pay of
the nation's non-supervisory production workers _ about 90 million
people in a work force of 130.3 million last month _ rose by 6
cents in January, to $13.50 an hour. That represents an annual rise
of just 3.5 percent, down from an annualized increase of 3.7
percent last fall. Most other labor cost indexes are also rising
mildly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Whatever the inflationary impact of a booming job market, the
monthly job reports, including the one in January, suggest that
millions of Americans are finding it easier to make ends meet. The
percentage of the work force holding two or more jobs, for example,
fell to 5.7 percent last month from 6 percent in January of last
year _ suggesting that more and more people now earn enough at one
job to get by or get enough extra hours from their employer to
avoid taking a second job, or both.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, the number of people stuck in part-time jobs because
they cannot get full-time work is shrinking. And so is a pool of
people who say they would like to work but are not looking, because
they are discouraged or think they cannot find work or cannot
arrange child care, transportation and the like. Since they are not
actively looking for work, they are not included in the labor
force, even as unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   But these are the people who are being drawn increasingly into
jobs. Their numbers have dwindled steadily from 6.7 million in
January 1994, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics first started to
track them, to 4.7 million in January 1999 and to 4.3 million last
month, the Bureau reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That means a pool of more than 10 million people still to draw
from, including the 6 million who are listed as actively looking
for work and therefore officially unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``An economy where jobs are looking for people as well as people
looking for jobs is one of the best social programs we have,'' said
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers at a news conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The weather was not the only factor in driving up job creation
last month. The Census Bureau added 11,000 people in January as it
geared up for the 2000 census. After months of cutting back,
manufacturers have begun to add people, including 13,000 in
January. With oil prices rising, the petroleum industry is also
adding people, particularly to drill for oil. Retailers added
43,000 people, which is unusual so soon after Christmas, although
consumer spending continues to be robust. There were also increases
in the computer industry and child care, which like retailing and
manufacturing reflected the robust economy.

   NEW YORK _ A year to the day after Amadou Diallo died in a
police fusillade outside his Bronx apartment, his death was marked
Friday in the city's largest cathedral and at a weathered police
station, at City Hall and in front of the vestibule where he died.
</P>
<P>
   Those who stopped to remember or pay homage to Diallo, the
22-year-old West African street vendor whose death led to mass
protests against police brutality, did so in vastly different ways
that mirrored the discord over the circumstances of his death.
</P>
<P>
   Some said the time had come to make peace and heal the wounds of
the last year. Others angrily called for swift and severe
punishment for the four officers who fired the shots, whose murder
trial began in Albany this week. Some defended the police, saying
the death, while tragic, was an understandable mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had his say in his weekly radio show,
asserting that the Police Department had been treated unfairly by
people who had exploited the shooting. ``You know something, I have
a revelation,'' the mayor said. ``This is prejudice. It is the same
kind of thing we are fighting against in terms of race prejudice,
religious prejudice, ethnic prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last year the death of the unarmed Diallo, who was hit by
19 of 41 shots fired by the officers, has further strained the
relationship between the Police Department, which attributes
sharply lowered crime to its aggressive crime-fighting strategies,
and those who say that its success has come at the expense of
minority residents.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring the death prompted a string of protests in which
1,200 people _ including David Dinkins, the former mayor; the Rev.
Jesse Jackson; Rep. Charles Rangel, a Harlem Democrat; and several
other politicians _ were arrested in acts of civil disobedience at
1 Police Plaza. The mayor initially ridiculed the demonstrators,
saying the protests were ``getting silly, actually.'' He later
struck a more conciliatory tone and met with some black leaders.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Outside the Wheeler Avenue row house in the Soundview area of
the Bronx where Diallo died, more than 250 people gathered Friday
night at a vigil to remember him and show that they were closely
following the proceedings in Albany, where the trial has been moved
because of concerns about pretrial publicity. They were greeted by
Diallo's mother, Kadiatou Diallo, and his father, Saikou Amad
Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amadou was loved,'' Ms. Diallo said, standing before a podium
at the brick row house. ``He had hopes and dreams in America. He
was a hard-working man, and he knew he could make it. What happened
to him shouldn't happen to anyone anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, who accompanied Diallo's parents Friday
night, said it was necessary for people to return to the scene of
the shooting to remember. ``Why a candlelight vigil?,'' Sharpton
asked. ``Because the only way to curse the darkness is to hold the
light in Amadou's name. We will not sit by and let what happened to
Amadou go. We will not let it rest until we get justice for him.''
</P>
<P>
   A far different scene unfolded Friday afternoon at the Cathedral
of St. John the Divine, where religious leaders from a range of
denominations _ Muslims, Roman Catholics, Jews, Buddhists and
Hindus _ offered prayers, sermons and readings from Scripture in
what they called an effort to heal the pain felt in so many corners
of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Very Rev. James P. Morton, president of the Interfaith
Center of New York and an event organizer, called Diallo's death a
terrible injustice but said that the four officers and their
families must also be remembered for their suffering of the past
year. He called for reconciliation and understanding, saying that
the police who patrol neighborhoods like Soundview and those who
live there have more in common than many people realize.
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary was also on the minds of officers at the 43rd
Precinct station house in the Bronx, which covers Soundview. ``We
need support out here, too,'' said one officer, Tim Cronin. ``This
is a tragedy, not a crime. The community knows we are here for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Cronin and other officers met inside the station house
with Patrick Lynch, the president of the Police Benevolent
Association. Speaking with reporters later, Lynch described the
meeting as a pep rally and predicted that the four officers on
trial would be vindicated by the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're finally going to get the chance to let the
jurors understand what the cops went through,'' he said. ``This was
a tragedy. We have nothing against the Diallo family. These are
four cops who are being unfairly tried. This is something that
should not be considered murder, that should not be considered a
crime.''

 &HT;    Bush launches more aggressive attack on McCain
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Taking a page from Democrat Al Gore's playbook,
Gov. George W. Bush on Friday worked to boost his faltering
campaign by lashing out at Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Still reeling from his double-digit defeat in New Hampshire on
Tuesday, a sharp-tongued Bush attacked McCain face-to-face in
Michigan and on the air in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``important for the people to know that my friend is
raising money from people who have business in front of his
committee'' in the Senate, Bush told a gathering in Troy, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the sharpest Bush commercial of his campaign
went up in South Carolina accusing McCain of distorting Bush's $483
billion tax cut plan and of ``echoing Washington Democrats'' on the
tax issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides, seeking to reassure nervous supporters, promised
that South Carolina's increasingly critical Feb. 19 primary would
turn into an all-out brawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush intends to fight back,'' spokesman Ari Fleischer
said. ``He's got the fire in the belly necessary to fight for and
win this nomination. ... We have a fight on our hands. There's no
doubt about it and the governor recognizes it.''
</P>
<P>
   It may also signal the level of apprehension being voiced by key
financial backers. One Bush moneyman, called a Pioneer for
personally raising at least $100,000 for Bush, summed up the
anxiety he said others also are feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's coming in, isn't it?'' he said of McCain's fund-raising
bonanza. ``My God, I hope my candidate doesn't lose. Is it too late
to sign up for McCain? Maybe I can quickly raise him $100,000. I
want to go to Washington. I want to be in somebody's
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Buchanan, a political scientist at the University of
Texas, said Bush must convince his backers that he has the resolve
to fight. With $68.7 million in contributions and the backing of
Republican lawmakers and governors, Bush remains, far and away, the
GOP's favorite son _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a fragile psychological moment here where people on
the Hill and big money backers around the country are wondering
whether this guy's got what it takes,'' Buchanan said. ``What Bush
has to do is very aggressively get in the face of all those
wavering people. This is not just a campaign moment I'm talking
about, but a behind-the- scenes act.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush plans to huddle with his staff this weekend, in what
Fleischer called a regular meeting but also ``an important
conversation that follows what happened in New Hampshire.'' He said
Bush will ``recharge and come out charging Monday,'' when he heads
to Delaware for that state's primary Feb. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Bush travels to South Carolina on Tuesday, where he is expected
to campaign Wednesday and Thursday. An aide said Bush likely will
add Friday and Monday to his South Carolina schedule, but would not
say if Bush will campaign there the weekend before heading into the
final stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an energized McCain continued to haul in the rewards
of his stunning victory, touting the $1 million he reported raising
over the Internet in 48 hours. A poll released Friday showed McCain
and Bush in a statistical dead heat. That's the third poll in as
many days showing Bush's 20-point lead in South Carolina disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporters downplayed the still-unfolding damage from his
New Hampshire defeat. Bush Pioneer Brad Freeman said he has been
talking with others who have raised at least $100,000 for the
campaign and aren't overly worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've called a number of people and people just say, `Hey, what
can I do? Let's buckle down. We want this to happen.' I don't have
a concern about getting the nomination. I wish we'd have won,
obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters in South Carolina are urging Bush to go after McCain,
and it was clear Friday that the gentlemanly veneer the two have
maintained is fading fast. Bush took aim at McCain's stance as a
campaign finance reformer, seeking to portray him as a Washington
insider beholden to special interests.
</P>
<P>
   That's the sort of thing South Carolina State Rep. H.B. ``Chip''
Limehouse, a Bush backer, wants to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't feel threatened,'' he said of the state's campaign
officials. ``They just feel it's time to strap down our helmets and
get ready to pay some contact football.''

   CHICAGO _ As Illinois examines what went wrong with a justice
system that sent 13 innocent men to death row, one common thread
has already emerged: poorly financed, often incompetent defense
lawyers who failed to uncover and present key evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a defense lawyer failed to prepare any strategy for
his client at the death penalty hearing the day after the
conviction, saying he had been hoping that the jury would opt for
manslaughter charges.
</P>
<P>
   Another defense lawyer rambled so incoherently during a death
penalty trial that a state Supreme Court justice wrote that the
proceeding ``would border on the comical if only it were
make-believe.''
</P>
<P>
   A third lawyer simply failed to attend some critical hearings,
arrived late at others and neglected to call witnesses who had
volunteered to testify about a defendant's character.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal defense for death row inmates has simply been
inadequate,'' said Elisabeth Semel, who heads an American Bar
Association project that focuses on legal representation for people
facing the death penalty. Other legal experts add that the
situation in Illinois is mirrored in many other states.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that opponents of the death penalty
criticize the legal system for failing to provide adequate
defenses. But in Illinois, the same criticism is now being offered
by some supporters of executions, many of whom now back Gov. George
Ryan's decision this week to place a moratorium on implementation
of the death penalty until a panel can study it.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, a moderate Republican who supports the death
penalty, announced the moratorium after new evidence cleared 13 men
who had been convicted and sent to death row since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   In supporting the governor's decision, Mayor Richard M. Daley of
Chicago, who prosecuted some of the death penalty cases as Cook
County state's attorney in the 1980s, said the defense lawyers in
some of those cases were sometimes incompetent and lacked the money
to conduct their own thorough investigations and compete against
the police and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the cases involved questions of poor defense work.
Some also resulted in accusations of overly aggressive police
officials and prosecutorial misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   But just as striking is the fact that in three cases, college
students working on class projects at Northwestern University were
able to find evidence that had escaped the attention of defense
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   While a proper defense in a death penalty case takes months of
research and costs $250,000 or more, Semel said, defendants in
these cases are often represented by lawyers who are paid a few
thousand dollars, or less, and spend only two days on a case.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get what you pay for,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the actual trial, judges conduct separate
hearings in each case to determine whether a defendant should be
executed, which adds to the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to afford good legal help, the families of defendants
often settle, in desperation, for any lawyer who will take a case,
regardless of reputation. The results are not surprising. A Chicago
Tribune examination of death penalty cases found that 33 defendants
sentenced to die were represented by a lawyer who had been
disbarred or suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of these inmates, in some cases, depends on volunteers
unearthing evidence, or just plain luck.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer who failed to prepare a strategy for the death
penalty hearing for his client had never handled a death penalty
case. The lawyer, Richard G. Younge, 75, said he was unaware that
the hearing would come only a day after the conviction. A state
judge voided the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Washington, the lawyer who missed some hearings and arrived
late to others, had taken the case of Bernon Howrey, of Kankakee,
for a flat $8,000 fee.
</P>
<P>
   While a spotlight has been cast on the Illinois system, some
legal experts contend that many of the same problems of woeful
representation exist in many states.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts have emerged from around the nation of defense lawyers
who slept through trials, or came to court drunk. Courts have
assigned death penalty cases to lawyers who have never tried a
criminal case, like tax lawyers. And for many of the decent,
hardworking lawyers who take death penalty cases, the money paid by
poor families is generally so paltry that paying for a thorough
investigation is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get these families who go shopping for a lawyer with, say,
$10,000, which seems like all the money in the world to them,''
said Lawrence Marshall, a law professor who heads the Center on
Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University. ``A good lawyer
will tell them it can't possibly be done for that money. So they
keep looking, until they find someone who will take the case. It's
usually a down-on-the-luck lawyer who figures the case is probably
going to plead anyway, so it's a quick $10,000.''
</P>
<P>
   He said many of these lawyers have never tried a death penalty
case, which tend to be complicated. And they do not have the money
to do some of the basic legwork needed.
</P>
<P>
   Seymour Simon, a former Illinois supreme court justice and
longtime foe of the death penalty, said he believed the poor legal
representation for defendants made the death penalty unjust.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois court in 1982 once denied an appeal to the death
penalty on the grounds of incompetent legal representation _ only
to turn to a case weeks later on the disbarment of the very same
lawyer, Archie Weston, who had represented the condemned man,
Dennis Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was accused of looting an estate,'' said Simon. ``We asked
him why he had missed a disciplinary hearing. He said at the time
he was so stressed out he couldn't think straight.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the period he was talking about matched the
time he was representing the death row defendant. A new trial was
ordered, which resulted in another conviction. This is one of the
13 cases cited by Ryan in his decision.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, DNA evidence proved Williams was innocent of two
murder charges. He was freed in 1996 after spending 18 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The wrongful conviction cost Cook County, which administered the
trials, nearly $13 million in damages to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have recently cited the accounts of such mistakes and
poor legal representation in calling for changes to federal
execution law. Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., said it seemed
obvious that mistakes caught in Illinois were occurring in other
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Illinois was just honest enough to admit it,'' Feingold said.
</P>
<P>
   But while concerns have grown over poor legal representation and
mistaken convictions, laws in recent years have nonetheless cut
legal aid for defendants who cannot afford their own lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress eliminated spending for the 20 Death Penalty
Resource Centers, which existed to help mount the appeals of death
row inmates, who are almost always poor.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, there has been little effort to improve legal help
for poor defendants, even though 20 wrongful convictions resulted
in inmates being sent to death row _ the most in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in Florida recently enacted a so-called fast-track
system that shortens times for appeals for inmates sentenced to
die.
</P>
<P>
   Poor people charged with serious crimes have been entitled to
legal assistance since the U.S. Supreme Court's Gideon vs.
Wainwright decision in 1963. But that aid varies sharply among the
states. Alabama pays $30 an hour to lawyers for out-of-court work
while representing poor defendants. New York, which is regarded as
having one of the best systems for the poor, pays $125 an hour,
still far less than a good lawyer in private practice would charge.
New York also has a Capital Defender Unit, which specializes in
cases that are eligible for the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Even prosecutors acknowledge that defense lawyers typically
start at a disadvantage when they go up against experienced
prosecutors. Richard Devine, the state's attorney in Cook County,
noted that his office has 300 lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time someone is trying a capital case, they have had a
lot of experience,'' Devine said.
</P>
<P>
   Semel used a boxing analogy to describe the disparity in
resources and experience between prosecutors and defense lawyers in
most death penalty cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a match between Mike Tyson and Martin Short,'' she
said, ``and the referee _ the judge _ is on Tyson's payroll.''

GENERAL CHALLENGE IS PICK IN STRUB STAKES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ All it takes is one look at the list of past
winners to realize that the Strub Stakes is something special.
</P>
<P>
   When placed alongside the Santa Anita Derby and the Big 'Cap,
the $500,000 Grade II route for four-year-olds at 1 1/8 mile is
clearly one of Santa Anita's signature events.
</P>
<P>
   In television and newspaper advertisements, Santa Anita has been
pitching the race on its past and who can blame them?
</P>
<P>
   After all, the list of Strub winners includes Silver Charm, Best
Pal, Alysheba, Spectacular Bid, Affirmed and Determine -- to name a
few.
</P>
<P>
   If the past is any guide, then today's match between five horses
promises to be plenty exciting.
</P>
<P>
   As for the morning line, General Challenge, the Bob
Baffert-trained son of General Meeting, has been installed as the
favorite at 7-5. But, Baffert hasn't done well in stakes races this
meet and General Challenge -- with Corey Nakatani in the saddle --
is going to need a real smooth trip to be the best.
</P>
<P>
   Other entries, from the rail out, include Cape Canaveral, with
Pat Day up, odds 9-2; Saint's Honor, Kent Desormeaux, 2-1; Cliquot,
Eddie Delahoussaye, 8-1; Luftikis, Chris McCarron 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   With a definite ability to shine, longshot Luftikus will have to
be considered a threat. Known as the ``house horse,'' because he is
owned by Santa Anita's boss Frank Stronach, Luftikus put away
lesser opponents in a Jan. 8, allowance race, with Desormeaux
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Although this will be Luftikus' first stakes race, trainer
Vladimir Cerin isn't worried at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing great, just fantastic,'' Cerin said. ``We don't
really know how good he is yet, and I hope we still don't after
(the race.)''
</P>
<P>
   Another threat though will be Cape Canaveral, a winner in three
of four life time starts. His last win came Jan. 15, in an
allowance race.
</P>
<P>
   For Randy Bradshaw, an assistant trainer in D. Wayne Lukas' barn
the three-length win was perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The colt won impressively last time,'' Bradshaw said. ``He
finished up like the mile-and-an-eighth is within reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Post time for the Strub, Saturday's ninth race, will be
approximately 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   (BOX) The Strub is one of 10 total races on Saturday's card.
Also running are the 7-furlong, $150,000 Grade II San Vicente
Stakes for three-year-olds and the mile-long $150,000 Pro or Con
Handicap on the turf course for fillies and mares four-years-old
and up. The San Vicente will feature a field of six including
favorite Malabar Gold at 8-5. A total of 13 will run in the Pro or
Con including favorite Ta Ta Be True at 4-1, with patrick
Valenzuela scheduled to ride.
</P>
<P>
   (BOX) Television coverage of today's action will be heavy. The
Santa Vicente will be shown live on ESPN betwen 2 and 3 p.m. as
part of National Car Rental's Racing to the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Strub, it will be broadcast as part of Santa Anita
live on Fox Sports Net West 2 at 4 p.m.

<HEADLINE>
BEFORE ELIAN GONZALEZ, THERE WAS A CASE PITTING A POPE AGAINST
JEWISH PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   All analogies are imperfect, and this one may be more imperfect
than most. But the political and emotional tumult over Elian
Gonzalez may illuminate an international incident over a child's
destiny, religious rather than national, that stirred emotions on
both sides of the Atlantic 140 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of June 23, 1858, a squad of policemen arrived at
the apartment of Momolo and Marianna Mortara, an Italian Jewish
couple in Bologna, then part of the Papal States that formed a
swath across the Italian Peninsula, running north and east from
Rome to the Po River on the border of Austrian-ruled Veneto.
</P>
<P>
   Politely but without regard for the cries of a hysterical
mother, the police removed the Mortaras' 6-year-old son, Edgardo,
from the household and put him in the hands of Roman Catholic
officials, who whisked him away to Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Five years earlier, a teen-age Catholic servant girl had
surreptitiously baptized Edgardo, or so she now fearfully said.
Church law strictly forbade the baptism of Jewish children without
their parents' consent except when the child was in imminent danger
of death, which is exactly what the illiterate maid, who was no
longer in the Mortaras' employ, claimed had driven her to baptize
the ailing infant.
</P>
<P>
   But once such a child was properly baptized, whether prudently
or not, the same church law decreed that he or she must not be
raised by the Jewish parents but by Catholics _ and in the Papal
States of 1858, church law was also civil law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara,'' to use the title of David
I. Kertzer's carefully documented and heart-wrenching account,
published in 1997 by Knopf, became an international cause celebre.
In one month alone, The New York Times devoted 20 articles to the
Mortaras' unavailing struggle to regain their son.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians protested the church's action. The Rothschilds tried
backdoor diplomacy. According to Kertzer, the Paul Dupee Jr.
university professor of social science at Brown University, the
backlash against the Vatican for the seizure was a crucial element
in the collapse of support for the longstanding papal rule of parts
of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the prolonged diplomacy, legal maneuvering and
frustrating negotiations over whether _ and under what conditions _
the parents could meet with their child, sent to live in a
church-run residence in Rome, Edgardo's fate may have been decided
within days of his removal from Bologna. Care and attention was
lavished on him, soon enough by Pope Pius IX himself. Boy and pope
came to regard each other as father and son.
</P>
<P>
   The Mortaras and their supporters insisted Edgardo was true to
his Jewish faith and was being held against his will. Defenders of
the church testified that the boy had barely left his parents' home
when he began displaying a virtually miraculous attachment to
Catholicism. Vatican officials quoted him declaring: ``I am
baptized. My father is the pope.''
</P>
<P>
   At 13 the boy entered a seminary. In 1870, when the last
remnants of papal rule were shattered by the new united Italian
state, the 19-year-old Edgardo fled Rome rather than return to his
family. After living in monasteries under an assumed name, he was
ordained Father Pio (for Pius) Edgardo and entered into a long,
distinguished life of study and preaching. He died in Belgium in
1940, a month before the Nazi invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Kertzer fits this drama into a much broader picture _ of
historic mistreatment of Jews, of the battle between constitutional
liberalism and dynastic conservatism in 19th-century Europe, even
of Know-Nothing anti-Catholicism in the United States and the fight
over Southern slavery, which abolitionists pointed out treated this
kind of forcible separation of children from parents as perfectly
legal.
</P>
<P>
   Today one hopes that the Edgardo Mortara story gives pause to
those Vatican stalwarts promoting the sainthood of the reactionary
Pope Pius IX. A surprising number of Pius IX's contemporaries found
him a charismatic, attractive personality, who had ameliorated some
of the humiliating centuries-old restrictions on Jews in Rome while
retaining others.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no evading the fact that his conduct in the Mortara
case was of a piece with an outlook that led him to denounce
vehemently most of what his current successor, Pope John Paul II,
has been preaching about religious freedom and human rights for two
decades. Conservative Catholics would take on a heavy burden in
making Pius IX their poster pope.
</P>
<P>
   What is puzzling about the Mortara story, even in Kertzer's
detailed account, is why so many otherwise reasonable people
remained adamant about tearing a child from his parents _ despite
the heavy price to the church in moral credibility and political
influence. Sheer legalistic adherence to church law does not
explain it, nor even anti-Semitism, although that was always an
important factor in the background, nor even the highly politicized
atmosphere that quickly engulfed the family and church officials.
</P>
<P>
   It is at this point that the battle over Elian Gonzalez, the
Cuban boy whose mother died with 10 others when their boat
capsized, can shed some light on the battle over Edgardo Mortara _
and maybe vice versa. Those determined that young Elian should stay
in the United States rather than be returned to his father in Cuba
cannot bear the thought that he might forever lose the benefits of
this nation's freedom, opportunity and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   But even the worldly rights and advantages that come with
growing up in Miami pale beside the divine graces and eternal
rewards that, for Pope Pius IX and like-minded 19th-century
Catholics, were at stake for young Edgardo.
</P>
<P>
   To the contemporary question, ``What's in the best interests of
the boy?'' a believer like Pius IX would have summoned up not just
Disneyland, but paradise itself, not just citizenship in the United
States, but citizenship in the City of God.
</P>
<P>
   For Catholicism, of course, things have changed drastically. Not
only did the Papal States disappear, but Pope Pius IX's
understanding of church teaching did not survive the Second Vatican
Council with its affirmations of religious liberty and the
permanent religious value of Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   And when Catholic New York, the weekly paper of the New York
archdiocese, looked at whether ``an American upbringing is more
important than a parent's right,'' the paper, which entertains no
affection for Fidel Castro's Cuba, did not hesitate. Barring
serious dereliction, it editorialized, a parent's right ``is
paramount,'' even, quoting the Catechism of the Catholic Church,
``primordial and inalienable.''

SPORTS COLUMN: AN OLD PRO ON HANDLING AN AGING PRO 
</HEADLINE>

 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Frank Layden met a handful of reporters Thursday
evening to talk about his new position in basketball. This was
during intermission of the Knicks-Trail Blazers game. Layden was
being introduced as the Knicks' new basketball consultant, a
position created over dinner _ where else? _ by his son, Scott, the
general manager of the Knicks, and Dave Checketts, the president of
Madison Square Garden. Frank Layden says his role is to provide
insight and advice in a wide range of matters.
</P>
<P>
   I wondered what advice he might offer the Knicks about Patrick
Ewing, the 37-year-old center who is having major issues adjusting
to life outside the limelight as the Knicks feature younger legs.
Frank Layden, one day on the job, was candid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like anybody else, I read the papers,'' Layden said. ``I know
this about Patrick Ewing: He's made a great contribution to this
game. He was a great college player. He was a great professional
player. He came out and gave everything he had every night. Now, as
you get toward the end of the career, I think that what you should
do is honor that and by all means do whatever you can to have a
player of that stature remain with your team _ to be productive and
try to reason with them that whatever you are doing is not only for
the good of the team but is also for their good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get the most out of him and have him play well, and make sure
that he knows that's good for him as well as for the team,'' Layden
said. ``You owe that to him, and then he will give back to the
team.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks face a complex situation in dealing with Ewing. Jeff
Van Gundy, the Knicks' head coach, no longer needs Ewing to keep
him from drowning. Now he wants his friend and center to accept a
new role without grumbling or destroying the team's chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Layden pointed out what he felt was the most obvious problem.
``In my mind, this team cannot win a championship without Patrick
Ewing,'' he said. ``If Patrick Ewing goes down, they cannot win a
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ewing wanted to be wicked, really wicked, he would tell his
bulldog lawyer, David Falk, to escalate talks with the Wizards
about sending Ewing back to Washington, back to the city that
remembers him from his college days at Georgetown, where he won a
national title. Michael Jordan would love to have Ewing on his new
team. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the Patrick Ewing we knew two years ago, five years
ago, 10 years ago,'' Layden said. ``There's always this thin line
with older players. When time gets near, it's hard for them. What
we have to do, as the people who have the experience already, we
have to say, `We understand,' and try to make the transition as
painless as possible, and still win.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing scored 20 points and grabbed nine rebounds against the
Trail Blazers on Thursday. After the game he said that he felt that
he was getting back to pre-injury form. In typical knee-jerk
fashion, many critics who had Ewing on his way out of town changed
their tunes.
</P>
<P>
   But the controversy surrounding Ewing goes beyond a good game
here or a bad game there. This is about stature and presence.
Things have been rolling along so merrily in Knickland that we
forget that this team is an active volcano; an eruption could come
with the next extended losing streak, or benching, or injury, or an
early-round elimination.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards' Juwan Howard, the player mentioned in trade talks
involving Ewing, is a nice player, an intelligent player. He lacks
the weight and stature to hold down a locker room like the Knicks'.
And Howard is one of the more level-headed young players around.
Search the league for any other young player the Knicks could bring
in to help take Ewing's place. Odds are he hasn't yet discovered
the balance between making an enormous sum of money and putting out
an enormous effort. That was never Ewing's problem. Ego, yes.
Effort, no.
</P>
<P>
   Pull Ewing's roots out of the Knicks and there may not be enough
gauze and thread to stop the bleeding and close the wound. New York
and Ewing cannot do without each other. For Ewing, the idea of the
Knicks winning a championship without him is unconscionable. For
the Knicks, the possibility of winning a championship this season
without Ewing is a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just tell a player like that, `Go,''' Layden said.
``He's got to play a role if you're going to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a bit more complex than saying, ``We're going in a
different direction,'' and taking off. This is the championship
riddle Layden will have to help the Knicks solve: How do you make
Ewing a star and a backup in the same play?

 New Procedure May Delay Need to Split Area Codes  &HT;     By Todd Wallack 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
State regulators have picked San Francisco and Marin County as two
of the first places in the state to implement new measures to
conserve telephone numbers, a decision that could potentially
postpone the need to split the 415 area code.
<P>
   But ``number pooling'' could come too late to avoid a new area
code in Contra Costa and southern Alameda counties later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The California Public Utilities Commission is moving forward
with a plan to split the 925 area code down the middle, with
northern cities like Concord and Walnut Creek keeping their current
phone numbers, and southern towns like San Ramon, Danville, Dublin
and Livermore receiving a new area code later &LR;  this year &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   NeuStar, the Washington company that manages area codes
nationwide, currently estimates the 925 area code will be exhausted
by June, said spokeswoman Rebecca Barnhart. PUC spokeswoman Kyle
Devine disputed the estimates, saying it doesn't take into account
all the state's conservation measures. Devine said the PUC hasn't
decided yet when to split 925.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC has also considered an alternate plan to ``overlay'' a
new area code over the current one, which would allow current
residents to keep their telephone numbers, assign a new area code
to new numbers, and  &LR; but force residents to dial an area code to
call their neighbors. A majority of PUC commissioners, however,
staunchly  &LR; oppose overlay plans, which consumers tend to find
cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, regulators hope to stave off the need for new area
codes throughout California by using a new technique called
``number pooling.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, phone numbers are issued to telephone companies in
blocks of 10,000, even when they only need a few hundred or a
thousand numbers. But with number pooling, California can start
handing them out in blocks of 1,000 and ask phone companies to
return unused numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators won permission from the Federal Communications
Commission to implement the plan after nearly 200 new telephone
companies set up shop in California, offering everything from
wireless to local-toll service, and gobbling up countless prefixes
and phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how long number pooling will postpone the
need for a new area code in San Francisco, but experts say it's
been successful so far in Chicago and New York City. In Chicago,
regulators implemented number pooling for the 847 area code in
mid-1998, just before the region was due for another area code. The
area code still hasn't been exhausted to date. Similarly, New York
has been able to avoid splitting the 212 and 718 area codes through
number pooling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Number pooling is always going to extend the life of an area
code,'` Barnhart said, ``but (by how much) is going to vary.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, MCI WorldCom doubts it will make much difference for
older area codes, like 415, where most numbers and prefixes have
been assigned for some time. Though MCI spokesman Andy Shepard said
his company supports pooling, he added: ``We are not confident it
will extend the life of (415).''
</P>
<P>
   Without pooling, NeuStar estimates the 415 area code will be
exhausted by year-end. It's not clear how long pooling would stave
off the need for a split in 415.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that California cannot begin implementing
number pooling everywhere right away, said Natalie Billingsley, a
telecommunications specialist with the PUC's Office of Ratepayer
Advocates.
</P>
<P>
   State regulators plan to implement the measures first in 310 in
Los Angeles next month, then in 415 in San Francisco in late July
and later in 714 in Anaheim. Regulators haven't decided when to
start pooling numbers in 925.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, new area codes are becoming routine for towns like
Dublin, which switched from 415 to 510 to 925 over the past few
years. The latest switch went into effect in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly believe people are getting used to it,'' said Dublin
Mayor Guy Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a new area code would force businesses to order new
business cards and stationary. Minuteman Press in San Ramon saw
annual sales jump between 10 percent and 20 percent when 925 went
into effect. ``I'd like to have them do a new area code every
year,'' said Minuteman owner Drew Kocir.

 Avanex Soars in First Trading Day
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Todd Wallack &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Avanex, a Fremont company that makes parts for fiber-optic
networks, soared more than six-fold in its first day of trading
yesterday, enjoying the biggest first day gain for an IPO this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Avanex shares raced as high as $190 before closing at $172, up
$136. The company, which sold the shares for $36, now has a market
value of close to $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Optical networking is exploding,'' said Todd Brooks, a venture
capitalist with the Mayfield Fund in Palo Alto, who sits on the
company's board of directors. ``This is a real business with a very
high growth trajectory.''
</P>
<P>
   The sizzling initial public offering is just the latest sign of
Wall Street's interest in the relatively arcane world of fiber
optics, where firms use light instead of electrons to zap data
around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Though fiber optics has been evolving for years, the field has
boomed lately as telecommunications companies race to keep up with
the surging growth of the Internet, cell phones and other
communications tools.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore Networks Inc., another fiber-optics firm, has rised
nearly eight-fold since it first sold stock to the public last
fall. And just last month, JDS Uniphase Corp., which also makes
optical parts, paid $15 billion for cross-town rival E-Tek
Dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Avanex makes ``photonic processors,'' which are used to increase
the number of wavelengths of light that can travel over the same
wire. It sells the parts to telecommunications-equipment giants
like Nortel Networks, Lucent Technologies and Cisco Systems, which
in turn sell fiber-optics equipment to major Internet service
providers and telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the value of Avanex, though, is based on future growth.
The firm, with 251 workers, only shipped its first product in
April. The company recorded just $10.9 million in sales during the
second half of 1999, and lost nearly $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital firms Mayfield Fund, Sequoia Capital Fund,
Crosspoint Venture Partners and JAFCO America Ventures combined own
about 54 percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Avanex chief executive Walter Alessandrini owns about 9 percent
of the company, worth nearly $100 million at yesterday's closing
price. Vint Cerf, sometimes called the father of the Internet for
co-developing the basic language used to exchange information on
the Internet, is also on the company's board.

 U.S. Launches Probe of eBay  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The U.S. Justice Department is investigating whether online
auctioneer eBay engaged in unfair business practices by seeking to
cut off access to its listings by rival services.
<P>
   The government's probe has potentially far-reaching implications
for all Internet companies. At the heart of the inquiry is the
question of whether material published online belongs to the
original site or is in fact in the public domain.
</P>
<P>
   EBay executives were keeping tight-lipped about the matter
yesterday. But a company attorney, John Monahan, said in a
statement that eBay officials ``have had some discussions with
staff at the Justice Department regarding eBay and the online
trading business generally.''
</P>
<P>
   He said eBay ``welcomed that opportunity to talk about our
business'' and to express ``serious concerns'' about the actions of
search services that compile listings from different auction sites.
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose auctioneer has waged a noisy battle with so-called
aggregators over use of its millions of listings. EBay is suing one
such firm, Bidder's Edge of Massachusetts, and has attempted to
block access by another, AuctionWatch.com of San Bruno.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials at Bidder's Edge and AuctionWatch said
yesterday that they are cooperating with the Justice Department's
probe, which is still only at a preliminary stage.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear whether the government will launch a formal
investigation into the matter. Justice Department officials could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   James Carney, chief executive of Bidder's Edge, likened the
probe to the government's antitrust investigation of software giant
Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that they've got Microsoft out of the way, perhaps they
were looking for another case to pursue,'' he said. ``In the online
auction space, eBay is even greater than Microsoft in terms of the
marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, analysts said it appears that antitrust authorities are
being cautious this time around because any ruling on eBay's
practices could have broad ramifications for online businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, a ruling that eBay's listings are up for grabs to any
aggregator could suggest that no Web site has proprietary rights to
its content.
</P>
<P>
   It could also affect the fast-growing number of Internet
services that offer multiple-site price comparisons for electronic
purchases of everything from computers to books. In most cases,
buyers are steered to the site with the most attractive deal to
make a final transaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all new territory,'' said Dave Ricci, an analyst at
brokerage William Blair &AMP; Co. in Chicago. ``There are a number of
ways that this thing can go, and the government looks like it's
just testing things out and seeing what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Bidder's Edge and AuctionWatch both insist that the very future
of the Internet is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue is really about the openness of the World Wide
Web,'' said Andre Neumann-Loreck, president of Bidder's Edge. ``If
eBay erects barriers around its content, it will be bad for
consumers and it will be bad for e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   ``EBay's actions threaten the openness of the Internet,'' agreed
Nick Godfrey, director of marketing at AuctionWatch.''
</P>
<P>
   Both companies said they were approached last month by Justice
Department officials.
</P>
<P>
   While AuctionWatch declined to go into detail about its talks
with the government, Carney at Bidder's Edge said he met for about
two hours with a half-dozen Justice Department officials in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were asking all about business practices among auction
companies,'' he said. ``These people were very well organized. They
had clearly done their homework.''
</P>
<P>
   EBay filed suit against Bidder's Edge in December to stop it
from getting access to eBay's listings. Bidder's Edge is expected
to file its response on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, AuctionWatch said it too was expecting to be sued
after announcing that its engineers had managed to get around
technical barriers put up by eBay in November. It is again
including eBay's listings alongside those of rival auction sites
like Yahoo and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   So far, eBay's lawyers have yet to take action, although a
company spokesman, Kevin Pursglove, said at the time that ``all
options'' were being considered.
</P>
<P>
   EBay maintains that even though its listings are submitted by
users, aggregators are taking additional information, such as
number of bids received and length of bidding, that should be
considered eBay's property.
</P>
<P>
   AuctionWatch's Neumann-Loreck said eBay may claim this now, but
he noted that eBay had stressed it had no control over its content
when bidding for human organs and babies attracted attention a few
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``EBay tries to have it both ways,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   EBay's stock rose $3.06 yesterday to close at $168.06.

 Giving PCs to Workers Raises Questions  &HT;     By Kelly Zito 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Delta Air Lines and Ford Motor Corp. said they will make cheap PCs
and Internet access available to workers to improve their technical
skills and enhance communication. But what looks like a neat
employee perk brings up a snarl of workplace issues including
overtime pay, ergonomics and safety.
<P>
   For instance, what if an employee sustains a repetitive stress
injury while working on a company-provided computer? Or what if an
employee dials in to the company portal from home to check a few
e-mails and ends up working for three hours?
</P>
<P>
   While the deals will cost both the carmaker and the airline a
significant chunk of change _ one estimate pegged the cost to Ford
at $300 million over three years _ it could also work in the
companies' favor if employees shift some of their workload to the
home front _ either through telecommuting or adding evening and
weekend hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think that working from home is convenient for
the worker, whether it's a mom who has children to look after, or
traffic is a nightmare,'' said Katie Quan, former head of the San
Francisco Garment Workers Union and now a labor policy specialist
at the University of California at Berkeley. ``But few people
remember it's to the benefit of the employer. The employer doesn't
have to have space for the person and all the overhead that goes
along with a workstation.''
</P>
<P>
   Both companies strongly deny the initiatives are ways to arm a
new legion of telecommuters or to squeeze a few extra hours out of
workers. They say the hardware is intended to help connect
employees and expand their use of computers and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computers and the Internet are tools for the future,'' said
Ford spokesman Ron Iori. ``Our employees need to know those tools
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Iori said workers will be able to receive intra-company notices
about such things as the company's recent acquisition of Volvo, or
in the case of inclement weather, the delayed start of a shift. But
he said workers won't have home access to the company's innermost
networks, where designs, reports and presentations reside, in part
for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   At Delta, employees will have access to human resource policies,
phone directories, Delta's credit union and the company's ``News
Line'' newsletter, which updates workers on current company events,
among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the limited access to intra-company networks, some worry
about the implication for nonexempt employees, who work for an
hourly wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a good thing, but some issues could come up if
the employer said, `Why don't you take this home and finish it
there?''' said Dean Fryer, spokesman for the department of
industrial relations at the California Occupational Heath and
Safety Administration.
</P>
<P>
   If that does occur, he said, both employee and employer need to
make it clear that person is compensated accordingly, whether it's
considered overtime or not. Exempt, or salaried employees, aren't
subjected to the same regulations, and don't usually receive
overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
   United Auto Workers, the union which represents about 101,000
Ford manufacturing and assembly plant employees, doubts its mainly
nonexempt members will lose out on pay or other benefits, such as
vacation, which is often accrued on a cumulative basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do use (the computers) as a way for people to do more
work at home, 14 or 16 hours a day, that's a bad thing,'' said Paul
Krell, spokesman for the UAW in Detroit. ``Certainly for
UAW-represented employees that's not going to happen ... because we
have a strong contract. As for the other workers at Ford, we don't
think people will let themselves be taken advantage of that way.''
</P>
<P>
   On the corporate side of the fence, legal experts believe the
measure might expose the companies to additional liability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that you have a company computer at home would make
it easier for a workers compensation judge to say the (repetitive
stress) injury is 'industrial,''' said John True of Rudy Exelrod
Zieff &AMP; True, a San Francisco firm specializing in plaintiff
employment law. ``In that sense it sort of extends the workplace
into the home.''
</P>
<P>
   However, unless time on the computer can proven to be
work-related, the ruling is less likely to be in favor of the
worker, True said.
</P>
<P>
   On the legal question, both Delta and Ford have similar, if
vague, answers. But both companies say it's totally &LR; up to employees
whether they accept the computer and Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the (legal) issue will have to be addressed at some
point in time,'' said Delta spokeswoman Peggy Estes. ``There are a
lot of issues we haven't ironed out completely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But these (computers) are not for telecommuting. If they want
to take the computer they can. If they don't want it they don't
have to take it.''

 S.F. Startup Organizing PC Program  &HT;     By Carrie Kirby 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
PeoplePC _ the San Francisco company running the cheap-PC programs
announced by President Clinton, Ford Motor Company and Delta
Airlines this week _ didn't even exist six months ago.
<P>
   ``It's buzzing,'' said public relations manager Jennifer Gould,
summing up the mood of her 50-odd co-workers in the company's Pine
Street headquarters. Since the Ford and Delta announcements
Thursday and Friday, ``We've been getting all sorts of phone calls
from people who are interested in doing deals and partnerships.''
</P>
<P>
   PeoplePC sells name-brand computers and monitors with 56K
Internet access for $25-a-month payments over three years. At the
end of three years, customers can re-up and get a new computer, or
just keep the one they already have.
</P>
<P>
   Employees of Ford and Delta will get the same package (plus a
printer under the Ford plan) for as little as $5 a month, &UR;  &LR; thanks
to subsidies from their employers.
</P>
<P>
   PeoplePC doesn't make computers or provide Internet service
itself; it gets the hardware from Toshiba and has plans to use
Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and other brands soon. The Internet
connection comes from MCI or AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Just before founding PeoplePC in June 1999, chief executive Nick
Grouf was a venture partner at Softbank Technology Ventures, a San
Jose Internet investment firm that became PeoplePC's main backer.
</P>
<P>
   Grouf, now 31, was already an Internet veteran, having sold his
first startup, Firefly Network, to Microsoft in April 1998 for an
undisclosed sum. Firefly made privacy and personalization software
that has since been incorporated into the MSN Network as the basis
for the Passport electronic wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Although he already knew that Internet time was fast, Grouf said
that he was shocked when _ just weeks after he launched PeoplePC's
product in October _ he received an e-mail from a Ford executive
proposing a deal. The executive, whom Grouf did not name, had seen
PeoplePC's television commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Grouf credits PeoplePC's ability to scale quickly to its
``virtual business'' model, which involves contracting everything
out, including the 24-hour customer phone support and the local
repair service promised in its package. Still, it's had to invest
heavily in advertising, to the tune of $25 million so far. Using
PCs from well-known manufacturers helped PeoplePC nab quick
national recognition and avoid the pitfalls that grounded other
start-ups trying to distribute free or very cheap computers, said
Joe Laszlo, an analyst at Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very difficult if PeoplePC were acting as the PC
manufacturer, which is what several start-ups (such as
Seattle-based MicroWorkz) tried to do,'' Laszlo said.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts warn that most of the young company's challenges
still lie ahead of it. For one thing, it plans to only break even
with the monthly payments it collects from members. The profit,
PeoplePC hopes, will come from sales commissions on e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We offer our members discounts at More.com, Etoys (and more
than 70 other e-tailers),'' Grouf said. ``If a member decides to
take advantage of one of those deals, PeoplePC is compensated for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen this business model work yet,'' said Schelly
Olhava, a research analyst at IDC. ``If customers are only buying
$20 worth of books or CDs, is that really going to garner many
additional revenues for PeoplePC?''
</P>
<P>
   Supplying computers to the thousands of Ford and Delta employees
who may sign up will present another hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be hard for any company to follow through to get any
Ford employee a computer who wants one, if they all want one in the
same month,'' Laszlo said.
</P>
<P>
   PeoplePC's self-proclaimed mission is to ``democratize
technology,'' and lofty as that sounds, the assertion is backed up
by the company's support of the recently formed technology
initiative, ClickStart. Through ClickStart, poor families in the
Bay Area can get used, refurbished computers and Internet access
donated by PeoplePC for a payment of $5 a month. If the trial
program succeeds, as many as 9 million households could participate
in a nationwide, government-backed version.

ARIZONA BOY AT CENTER OF MEDICAL DEBATE 

</HEADLINE>

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A 4-year-old Arizona boy with brain cancer is at the
center of a national debate over medical freedom of choice because
a federal agency has refused to let him be treated by controversial
Houston doctor Stanislaw Burzynski.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the support of the Republican presidential candidates,
James and Donna Navarro have been unable to persuade the Food and
Drug Administration to let their son Thomas be treated with
antineoplastons, Burzynski's nontoxic alternative therapy, without
having first tried chemotherapy and radiation without success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medical mafia is thwarting what should be our freedom to
make intelligent decisions based on research,'' said James Navarro,
formerly a small-business owner from Arizona. ``Doctors who have
taken the Hippocratic oath have been less than honest with us and
portrayed as emotionally unstable zealots because we prefer a
doctor whose treatment itself won't ravage our son.''
</P>
<P>
   Conventional doctors want Navarro to follow the established
regimen of chemotherapy and radiation, which they say ``cures''
(meaning, still alive 5 years later) children in 50 to 70 percent
of cases with Thomas' particular kind of brain tumor, depending on
age. Besides the usual side effects of fatigue, hair loss, skin
rash and nausea, it also can cause hearing loss, spinal growth
deficit, hypothyroidism and mental retardation.
</P>
<P>
   Burzynski says his antineoplastons, a synthesized version of
human peptides found in blood and urine, can be an effective cancer
treatment without debilitating and lasting effects. But there is
only anectdotal evidence it works, because Burzynski has never done
clinically approved trials.
</P>
<P>
   Burzynski's use of antineoplastons caused a decades-long feud
with the government that culminated in 1997, when he was acquitted
of the last of 75 federal charges related to the interstate
shipment of the drug. But he is only now allowed to prescribe
antineoplastons in FDA-approved clinical trials; before trying the
treatment on brain cancer, patients must already have failed to
progress on chemotherapy and radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro's cause has been trumpeted by Republican presidential
candidate and former Ambassador Alan Keyes, who made it the subject
of a closing statement at one debate and opening statement at
another attended by the family.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes wrote a letter _ also signed by John McCain, George Bush,
Gary Bauer, Steve Forbes and Orrin Hatch _ to Health and Human
Services Secretary Donna Shalala, calling on her to allow immediate
antineoplaston treatment by Burzynski.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be the right of every responsible American citizen
to seek the medical care of their choice without government
bureaucracies standing in their way,'' wrote Keyes. ``Time is
running out for Thomas Navarro and for countless Americans like
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Though James Navarro said negotiations are under way, an FDA
spokesman said Friday he was not aware of any agency response to
the letter or a similar one to the FDA from Rep. Joe Barton, R-Ind.
The spokesman stressed that the FDA is a scientific regulatory
agency, not a political body.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no scientific or medical justification for approving
or even condoning the use of an unproven, potential therapy when a
very effective treatment exists and has become, in fact, a
universally recognized standard of care,'' Richard Pazdur, director
of the FDA's Division of Oncology Drug Products, told The Cancer
Letter. ``Ethically, giving a child an experimental product in such
circumstances flies in the face of all the guidelines and
regulations designed to protect children as research subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navarros met last week with doctors at the University of
Texas-M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston but nothing came of
it. In the meeting, arranged by Texas Commissioner of Health
William R. Archer III at the behest of Gov. George Bush, doctors
said they could treat the tumor with lower dosages and great
attention to alleviating side effects.
</P>
<P>
   But although James Navarro said he was impressed with the
honesty of those doctors _ his former doctors in Arizona only
grudgingly responded to questions about the effects of chemotherapy
and radiation, he said _ he and his wife left the meeting convinced
Burzynski remains their son's best option.
</P>
<P>
   Two studies are commonly cited about the effectiveness of
chemotherapy and radiation. One, which studied children from
infancy to 4 years of age, reported a five-year survival rate of 51
percent, significant neuropsychologic injury and a high rate of
disease recurrence. Another, which studied children from 3 to 10,
reported a survival rate of 70 percent, much less neuropsychologic
injury and a 10 percent rate of recurrence. Doctors say the child
fares better the older he or she is.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro said he believes studies are manipulated to sell a
product _ ``otherwise, people wouldn't be dying of cancer every 60
seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   At the FDA's request, Burzynski submitted a alternative therapy
protocol under which the Navarros wouldn't need to do chemotherapy
and radiation first, but it was rejected. He said it'd take 57
years to treat enough patients with the same tumor as Navarro's to
satisfy the FDA's rules for treating Navarro without prior
conventional treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But Burzynski said he believes a way will be found to allow him
to treat Navarro. ``I don't think the FDA will fight this to the
end,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Navarros have been in Houston since Nov. 10, less than two
month after conventional doctors in Arizona discovered Thomas had
medulloblastoma, performed surgery to remove it and then finally
told them about some of the typical effects of chemotherapy and
radiation. With any follow-up treatment, disease recurrence kills
90 percent of patients in 1 year and the remaining 10 percent in 2
years, the FDA says.
</P>
<P>
   The Navarros say they fear returning to Arizona because their
former doctors in Arizona have reported them to Child Protective
Services, which requested an interview with them through their
attorney. James Navarro said such cases usually lead to CPS taking
the child. A CPS spokesman in Arizona would not confirm the agency
had any such plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Navarro boy's condition was initially diagnosed as the flu,
but his persistent symptoms progressed into vision problems and
increased lethargy. An MRI scan during a second exam revealed the
tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery two days later was successful but initially left the boy
with ``no speech, no sight and no ability to walk,'' said his
father. Though those functions came back over time, ``his cognitive
skills are still lacking _ he's like a 4-year-old newborn in many
ways.'' That's the primary reason, his parents say, they don't want
to subject him to further toxic effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas is such a special kid that everyone who meets him falls
in love with him,'' said James Navarro. ``He so loves life. That's
why we don't want to see him lying in bed, writhing in pain, his
senses dulled, his sight, hearing and memory gone and his IQ
diminished.''
</P>
<P>
   Navarro said he hopes for a breakthrough soon. But if one isn't
reached in a month, he said, the family will go outside the United
States for treatment.

BUSH STICKS TO STRATEGY DESPITE DEFEAT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
and GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Still stinging from his New Hampshire defeat, Gov.
George W. Bush said irritably Friday that he will not give in to
``second guessers'' and change his overall strategy to win the GOP
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you hit a bump in the road, there's going to be a lot
of second guessers. I'm in this for the long run,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to yield. If people expect me to change on my
tax-cut plan, they better find themselves another candidate,'' Bush
said. ``That's the kind of poll-driven, focus-group politics that
this country is sick of.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's shocking New Hampshire victory by Sen. John McCain
caught not only the Bush campaign, but the national Republican
establishment off-guard as well.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who attacked McCain's congressional voting record on
veterans' issues Thursday, launched Friday what could arguably be
the most negative ad of his political career. The ad will run in
South Carolina, which holds its Republican primary Feb. 19 and for
which McCain and Bush are battling hard.
</P>
<P>
   The spot, running in South Carolina, says McCain knows his own
ad about Bush's tax plan is false, and accuses the Arizona senator
of siding with Washington Democrats in offering a smaller tax cut
than Bush's. It also suggests that McCain's tax plan does not put
any money aside for Social Security, which it does.
</P>
<P>
   The ad contains the tag line that Bush is ``ready to lead
America,'' a tacit reply to McCain and other rivals' charge that
the former president's son lacks the experience for the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   McCain left three days of campaigning in South Carolina Friday,
almost giddy from the thousands of people who attended a rally in
Florence and Myrtle Beach. ``There's something out there happening.
I've never seen this kind of electricity,'' an excited McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain victory wave set off ripples all over the country. A
New York judge ruled that McCain, Bush, Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes
must be allowed on the state's March 7 primary ballot. The ruling
came a day after Gov. George Pataki, a Bush supporter, gave up his
battle to keep McCain off the ballot in 16 of the state's 31
congressional districts. The fifth GOP candidate, Gary Bauer,
dropped out of the race on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is making a major speech to the California Republican
convention Saturday. Bush is skipping the GOP meeting in this key
primary state, sending brother Jeb, the governor of Florida,
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign has been under pressure this week to do
something, fast, to create an air of reassurance for the Republican
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush has kept to his 50-state strategy of
made-for-television campaigning and credibility-establishing
endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes denied reports that the campaign
would have a major strategy meeting in Austin, Texas, this weekend
to regroup. She said she planned to have her hair cut and Bush
planned to go to his ranch near Waco.
</P>
<P>
   But another Bush spokesman, Ari Fleischer, told reporters in
Austin that the governor will meet with his senior staff Saturday.
He called it ``an important meeting ... that follows what happened
in New Hampshire. ... We know we have a fight on our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain had been considered a long-shot in South Carolina. But
his government-reform message and challenge to the Republican
establishment, which opposes him on overhauling campaign finance
laws, has caught on with potential voters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who is attracting support from young independents and
some Democrats, could be helped even more by the open primary,
which like in Texas, allows voters to cast ballots in either
party's primary.
</P>
<P>
   The senator was greeted with loud applause when he portrayed his
own party leaders in Congress as captives of special interests.
</P>
<P>
   Bush again stuck to his formula Friday, speaking at the Marvin
L. Winans Academy for the Performing Arts in Detroit. While the
predominantly black elementary school held few voters, the scene
was made to promote Bush's ``compassionate conservative'' message
through television news coverage to voters in the Feb. 22 Michigan
primary.
</P>
<P>
   The latest public opinion poll in Michigan, taken last month,
showed Bush leading McCain by 51 percent to 17 percent. Michigan
Gov. John Engler and much of the state's GOP establishment is
backing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Even while Bush is holding firm to the idea that his campaign
themes, financing and organization will carry him to the nomination
in the long haul, Bush has gone on the attack against McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seized on a story in Friday's Wall Street Journal to
portray McCain as a Washington insider and as a hypocrite who
promotes campaign finance reform while taking money from special
interests with business before his Senate Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wall Street Journal did an interesting analysis today of
contributions, and it appears of all the candidates he's received
the most money from the Washington insiders,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are a chairman on the Commerce Committee, one is
capable of finding people to fly you on the airplanes and very
capable of using that position to raise money,'' said Bush, who has
raised a record $68 million for his own effort.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he does not believe McCain has done anything
illegal, ``but I think it's very important that the Washington
double-talk doesn't continue, which is to say, `I'm for this on the
one hand, but I'm doing this on the other.'''
</P>
<P>
   McCain responded, as he did Thursday, that Bush is showing the
effects of his Granite State defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all due respect, he is beginning to show a little sign of
desperation,'' McCain said. ``I would urge him to get back to the
issues Americans care about.''

NUCLEAR ANXIETIES IN A NEW WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the Cold War is over, some arms control analysts say
that the threat of a nuclear war is actually greater now.
</P>
<P>
   While Russia and the United States continue to reduce their
massive strategic nuclear arsenals _ from 4,700 each in 1992 to
between 2,000 and 2,500 in 1998 _ the Kremlin's Security Council
approved a disturbing shift in military doctrine Friday that
increases Russia's reliance on nuclear weapons. Rather than
threatening to use nuclear weapons only ``in case of a threat to
the existence of the Russian Federation,'' Russia now says it will
use them ``if all other means of resolving the crisis have been
exhausted,'' an apparently lower threshold.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Clinton administration says that at least 12
nations have acquired, or are trying to acquire, germ weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The likelihood of a nuclear weapon being used now is greater
than at any time other since the Cuban missile crisis,'' says
Thomas Graham Jr. a former high-ranking arms negotiator who heads
the Lawyers Alliance for World Security, a nonprofit arms control
group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   While not all scholars agree with Graham's particularly grim
assessment, these developments have been forcing arms control
theorists to rethink some of the basic precepts about how to
operate in a world filled not just with nuclear weapons, but with
other means of mass destruction. Should the United States,
traditionally a champion of agreements banning the use of such
weapons, threaten to use nuclear weapons to deter a devastating
chemical or biological attack on itself or its allies? If
deterrence fails, how should it respond? Would it punish a rogue
state by launching a nuclear attack?
</P>
<P>
   If the answers to such unsettling questions are not obvious,
they are not meant to be. For almost a decade, America has relied
on a doctrine called ``calculated ambiguity'' about its nuclear
intentions in such cases, or what Michael Krepon, president of the
Washington-based Henry L. Stimson Center, calls ``ominous
ambiguity.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Clinton administration says that the ambiguity is
deliberate, at least some of it reflects a continuing lack of
consensus within the nuclear establishment about how and when
nuclear weapons should be used, despite a series of major policy
reviews by the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Janne E. Nolan, the director of international programs at the
Century Foundation, argues in ``An Elusive Consensus,'' a slender
volume published last year by the Brookings Institution, that the
nuclear world has dramatically changed and that American nuclear
doctrine has not kept up.
</P>
<P>
   Since the advent of the nuclear age, nuclear strategy has been
based on the premise that the only way to deter an attack is to
prepare for the use of nuclear weapons in war. Following that
logic, American military planners in the 1950s quickly built a
nuclear force capable of destroying 70 Soviet cities with 133
low-yield bombs, says William M. Arkin, a nuclear weapons analyst
and co-author of ``Nuclear Battlefield'' (published in 1985).
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1950s, however, the thinking changed and the ability
to destroy all Soviet cities _ and have American cities obliterated
by Moscow _ was deemed insufficient to guarantee deterrence.
American theorists thus developed a new strategic view that
American nuclear weapons had to be sufficient in number and variety
to survive a surprise attack. These doctrines of ``counterforce''
and ``second strike'' fueled an explosion in numbers of warheads
and weapons during the remaining years of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   After the Soviet Union collapsed, the Bush administration
reversed decades of history and announced in 1992 that it was
abandoning the concept of global war with the Soviet Union as the
organizing principle behind America's military policy.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, said Nolan, Washington unilaterally de-emphasized
nuclear weapons and strengthened nuclear deterrence by, among other
things, taking strategic nuclear bombers off alert, removing launch
pins from long-range nuclear missiles, removing tactical nuclear
weapons from Europe, and negotiating the Start II treaty with
Moscow, under which the number of long-range nuclear-tipped
missiles was reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan says the Clinton administration, too, has made some
progress in limiting the spread of nuclear weapons and defusing the
threat of nuclear war, by helping some of the former Soviet
republics rid themselves of nuclear weapons and by winning support
for an extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, under
which nations without nuclear weapons vow not to acquire them in
exchange for help with civilian nuclear programs.
</P>
<P>
   But she also argues that the absence of presidential leadership
has allowed for doctrinal drift and paralysis as deep-seated
disagreements remain within the administration over how the United
States should respond to what is essentially a new threat: the use
of germ or chemical weapons against the United States or its
allies.
</P>
<P>
   A senior State Department arms control official says that treaty
obligations legally prevent the United States from using chemical
or biological weapons to respond to a germ or chemical attack. That
would seem to leave the United States with no choice but to use
conventional bombs or nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said the United States had historically forsworn the use
of nuclear weapons to deter any non-nuclear threats. But during the
Persian Gulf War, the stated policy shifted. To dissuade Saddam
Hussein from using chemical weapons, President George Bush sent the
Iraqis a letter in 1991 warning that Washington was prepared to use
``all means available'' to retaliate against Iraq if it used such
weapons. While memoirs by Bush, James Baker, secretary of state at
the time, and others subsequently stated that the United States
would not have actually used nuclear weapons against Iraq, the
letter was aimed at making him think the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We issued an ambiguous threat that we hoped would work, and it
apparently did,'' said Graham. ``But our calculated ambiguity
turned out to be a bluff. It won't be believed in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has followed a similar course. Over
the years, it has repudiated the use of nuclear weapons in a
growing number of cases, all the while facing pressure to expand
those commitments. For example, as part of an effort in 1995 to get
nations without nuclear weapons to swear off acquiring them, the
United States and four other nuclear powers pledged never to use
such weapons against a treaty signatory _ unless they were attacked
by a nonnuclear treaty member allied with a nuclear state. There
was no exception for an attack that used biological or chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the administration injected an element of ambiguity
into its policy in 1996 when it learned that Libya was building an
underground chemical installation. Citing a little-known rule of
international law known as ``belligerent reprisal,'' which holds
that a country can suspend its arms control commitments if it is
attacked by another country in violation of international law, the
administration warned that it would not limit its retaliatory
options if it was attacked by chemical or germ weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Graham says that the belligerent reprisal doctrine has given the
administration the military flexibility the Pentagon demanded in
what was a fierce internal battle. But even this ``out,'' he warns,
is limited. The doctrine requires that any response to an attack be
``proportionate'' to the attack itself and essential to prevent
another attack. Given these constraints, he concludes, a nuclear
response to a germ or chemical attack on America would almost never
be legal or justified in the world's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   How to resolve this quandary is still being quietly debated.
Last week the Washington-based Chemical and Biological Arms Control
Institute issued a report based on the recommendations of some of
the nation's leading defense analysts _ including R. James Woolsey,
a former CIA director; Robert B. Zoellick, a senior official in the
Reagan and Bush administrations and a foreign policy adviser to the
presidential aspirant George W. Bush; and Ronald F. Lehmann II, a
veteran defense official now at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory.
Although everyone agreed that the threat of biological weapons was
increasing, the 11-member group disagreed sharply about whether
nuclear weapons should have a role in retaliating against or
deterring a germ attack on the United States or its friends.
</P>
<P>
   Some panelists wanted Washington to declare explicitly that the
United States would not be the first to use a nuclear weapon
against a biological or chemical threat, arguing that there were
good conventional alternatives that would not violate promises
Washington has made to nonnuclear nations or undercut treaties to
limit the spread of nuclear weapons. Others countered that the best
way to deter attacks was to keep all military options open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously one of the toughest issues _ the only issue on
which even a rough consensus was not possible,'' said Michael
Moodie, a former arms negotiator and the institute's president.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a consensus on the wisdom of clarifying the American
position means that the current American policy _ threatening an
``absolutely overwhelming'' and a ``devastating'' response to an
unconventional attack _ is likely to continue. ``Ambiguity suits
everyone's purpose,'' said Philip Zelikow, a former White House
official and director of the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the
University of Virginia. ``So does the absence of public debate.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, one senior official said, doctrine matters mainly to
defense theorists. ``It doesn't really matter what your policy is.
In the real world, you're going do what you have to do.''

 PCs VULNERABLE TO SECURITY BREACHES, EXPERTS SAY  
 (With SECRET-PAPERS)  
(lh) 
 By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unless a home PC is placed in an isolation tank, computer
security experts say, it is vulnerable to a panoply of potential
intrusions.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, it can be an extremely hazardous place to keep
anything remotely confidential, much less the classified documents
that John M. Deutch, the former director of central intelligence,
had stored on his unsecured home computers in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more software people have on their computers, and the more
they are online, the more vulnerable they become to attack,'' said
Avi Rubin, an Internet security expert at AT&AMP;T Labs Research in
Florham Park, N.J. ``All the factors that contribute to increased
vulnerability are becoming more and more common.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, general awareness of security vulnerabilities among
home PC users was not very high in 1996, when people were beginning
to explore the World Wide Web in increasing numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now, the level of vulnerability depended largely on how
the computer was used and on what precautions were taken.
</P>
<P>
   A computer user's vulnerability to attack does not depend as
much on which Web site is visited as on what software is used to
gain access to the Internet, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch's computers had access to the Web via America Online.
And, in 1996, America Online accounts were among the most frequent
targets of attackers, who used sundry ploys to gain access to
members' passwords. This included planting malicious hidden
programs known as trojan horses on the victims' hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, experts have exposed a number of security holes
in browsing software. In general, however, e-mail programs are the
software most vulnerable to intrusion, said Richard Smith, an
Internet security consultant in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   That is because a trojan horse attack can come in the form of a
malicious program attached to a piece of e-mail or, in some
instances, can be carried within the e-mail message itself. In
either case, these programs end up on a computer's hard drive,
where they can do many kinds of mischief. For example, some have
been known to capture passwords by monitoring the victim's
keystrokes. This has been a common attack on AOL.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible that you can read files off a hard drive and
then send them back on the Web as e-mail to someone else, or post
them to a news group,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of a trojan horse is that it is a seemingly
legitimate program that hides _ and eventually executes _ a
malicious code.
</P>
<P>
   While many such attacks are mounted randomly, Smith said that
such a method of gaining access to a computer would be ideal for
espionage.
</P>
<P>
   ``These security holes would be a great way for spying,'' he
said. This could be accomplished, he said, by sending an e-mail
message containing a clandestine program that lowers the computer's
security settings, paving the way for a second, more malicious
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in the spy business,'' he said, ``what better way to
do it than to get the home e-mail addresses of important people and
use some of these security holes to bug their computer?''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he knew of no such incidents involving espionage, but
he added that a portion of a fast-spreading virus called Melissa,
which infected thousands of computers last year, worked by lowering
the security settings on target computers.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said it was only relatively recently that security holes
in Internet-based software were systematically documented.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Deutch had anti-virus software installed on his
computers has not been made public. Even if he did, Rubin said,
anti-virus software offers protection only against known viruses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big problem is a virus that's creative and new and acts in
a way unanticipated by the anti-virus writers,'' he said. ``There's
no way to defend against a virus like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have not revealed the kind of lines with which
Deutch's computers had been connected to the Internet, but it is
likely that they had used a dial-up modem.
</P>
<P>
   A dial-up connection poses less of a security risk than what is
known as a persistent connection _ like a cable modem or digital
subscriber line, or DSL _ in which a computer is always online.
</P>
<P>
   Persistent connections typically are much higher speed than
dial-up connections and have surged in popularity only recently.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Seiden, chief network security consultant to the
Kroll-O'Gara Information Security Group in Palo Alto, Calif., said
a more interesting question was the extent to which Deutch was
sending and receiving sensitive information from the home computer
via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail traveling over the Internet is vulnerable to
interception. Unless it is encrypted, its contents are there for
the taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I talked to someone at the CIA about sending
something there, they said to send it by U.S. mail,'' Seiden said.
``They didn't want me to e-mail them anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that no computer is an island these days, Rubin said,
has put security experts in something of an ``arms race'' with
potential intruders. ``They take a few steps forward, then we take
a few steps,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of a tremendous effort on the part of security
professionals to secure computers, Rubin said, ``I'd say the
attackers have the edge.''

WIRELESS COMPANIES FACE SOME THORNY TECHNICAL PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (With VODAFONE-MANNESMANN)  
(lh) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though Vodafone AirTouch of Britain's $183 billion deal to
acquire Mannesmann of Germany would be the biggest takeover in
corporate history, reactions to the deal Thursday from
telecommunications analysts and wireless telephone executives in
the United States were characterized mostly by profound ennui.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing more than the obvious,'' said one Wall Street analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty straightforward, isn't it?'' said an executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a huge impact globally,'' said another analyst.
</P>
<P>
   But the collective yawns may have only underscored how quickly
the communications industry is changing and how important the
wireless sector _ once a backwater _ has become.
Multibillion-dollar wireless deals have come so fast and furious
over the last year that Thursday's agreement seemed only to fit
into the pattern in what is perhaps the fastest-growing segment of
the global telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   It was not long ago that wireless phones were seen as the toys
of globe-trotting power brokers and gilded celebrities _ and were
priced to match. Now, about 85 million people use them in the
United States alone.
</P>
<P>
   That explosive growth has compelled communications companies on
both sides of the Atlantic to bet billions of their shareholders'
dollars on the vision of seamless global, or at least continental,
wireless service. More billions are being wagered that soon,
wireless Internet service will become as common as annoying
cell-phone users next to you at lunch.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Sprint, the big long-distance carrier, U &UR;  &LR; S
West, the Bell local phone company, and Tele-Communications Inc.,
the big cable television company, agreed to be acquired in separate
transactions for a total of about $176 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that a wireless phone company in Germany could be seen
to be worth more than all three of those companies combined speaks
for itself.
</P>
<P>
   But until wireless subscribers around the world can speak with
each other without roaming hassles and while traveling, the
industry must resolve some thorny technical and financial
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless is still a Tower of Babel. While almost all wireless
operators in Europe and the Middle East use a common digital
technology, known as GSM, for global system for mobile
communications, adoption of GSM has been far from global.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, GSM is generally used in the United States by
only a handful of smaller carriers, though some big communications
companies including BellSouth use GSM in parts of their networks.
More prominent in the United States are other, incompatible digital
technologies known as TDMA, for time-division multiple access (used
by AT&AMP;T, for instance), and CDMA, for code-division multiple access
(used by Sprint and Bell Atlantic, among others).
</P>
<P>
   The International Telecommunication Union, a U.N.
standards-setting organization, has been trying for years to
encourage wireless operators from around the globe to agree on a
common global standard so that companies can upgrade their networks
in the future. But much of that effort has stalled because of
political wrangling among communications equipment companies in
different countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial ideal was global roaming with one standard,'' said
John M. Bensche, a wireless analyst for Lehman Brothers. ``The
initial ideal of the ITU is not going to be realized.''
</P>
<P>
   At least not yet. Andrew Sukawaty, chief executive of Sprint's
wireless operation, Sprint PCS, which provided the main reason for
MCI WorldCom Inc. to agree to acquire Sprint last year, says he
expects global roaming in three or four years. But the technical
issues will not be solved through mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't really bring us one step closer to resolving the
worldwide issue because that's a standards issue,'' he said in an
interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   There are also important business issues to be resolved. When
wireless customers ``roam'' from their home network and onto the
system of another carrier, they face higher per-minute rates, and
the home carrier's profit margins generally suffer for having to
pay the owner of the host system in the roaming area for network
use.
</P>
<P>
   To offer rate plans that make widespread roaming financially
attractive, wireless carriers must either own far-flung networks
themselves or strike special partnerships with other carriers to
charge one another low roaming fees.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, an acquisition of Mannesmann by Vodafone would
facilitate roaming between Britain and Germany for customers of
those companies, but it would still leave major parts of Europe out
of the equation, even though the two companies have minority
investments in many other nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``While they have unified technology, from a business side,
offering pan-European service is not compelling for the carriers,''
Sukawaty said. ``This is just a start.''
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone's agreement to merge its U.S. operations into a joint
venture with Bell Atlantic and GTE Corp. could speed the advent of
seamless trans-Atlantic roaming. But those companies' customers in
the United States still generally use wireless phones that are
technically incompatible with European networks.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the scramble for scale will almost surely continue
in the wireless business as carriers try not only to offer their
customers broader networks but also to seek the financial
advantages that accrue to sheer size.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wireless business was always about coverage and
footprint,'' said Steven R. Yanis, an analyst for Banc of America
Securities. ``That originally meant, `Do you have your city
covered?' then `Do you have your region covered?' and then, `Do you
have your nation?' and now it's, `Do you have the globe covered?'''

 &HT;    Limo driver's testimony led to arrest
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa and Janet Frankston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Testimony from the driver of the now-famous stretch
limousine that spirited Ray Lewis from a bloody Atlanta crime scene
led police to charge the NFL star with two counts of murder.
</P>
<P>
   An arrest warrant and affidavit signed against the middle
linebacker was solely based on testimony given to Atlanta police by
limousine driver Duane Fassett, investigators with Atlanta's
Criminal Investigations Division said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, one of the men wanted for questioning about the
stabbings of Jacinth Baker and Richard Lollar _ A.J. Johnson _
denied he had ever ridden in the limousine Lewis was known to rent
regularly. Police said the 40-foot-long vehicle was seen speeding
from the corner of the crime scene the morning after Sunday's Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Ray said I was in the car, he's a damn liar. I know he
didn't say that,'' Johnson said Friday outside his apartment in
Laurel, Md. ``I've never, ever been in the Navigator limo. I've
never been in any Navigator limo. I never rode in that car.
Never.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he has no idea why police are linking him to the
murders. ``They haven't left a message on my phone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kwame King, a high school football teammate of Lewis' who is
also wanted for questioning, was said by family members in
Lakeland, Fla., to be in Atlanta cooperating with police.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police spokesman John Quigley would not confirm if
police were talking to King on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta homicide investigators arrived in Baltimore on Friday
morning, but Johnson said police have not contacted him. Johnson
said he had a Super Bowl party Sunday night with his fiancee,
Theresa Chin-Loy, and three other people. He added: ``I ain't done
nothing. I've never been to (Atlanta) to party. I don't know what
the limo looked like.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who played football at the University of Maryland, said
he met Lewis through a friend who plays on the Ravens, but said he
does not know him well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never rode with him,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm curious how my name got out.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he only knows Lewis well enough to exchange
greetings.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I was his friend, I would tell you I was his friend,''
Johnson said. ``Who wouldn't want to be Ray Lewis' friend?''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he is planning to coach high school football
someday and is worried that his name is being sullied. He said he
is looking forward to talking to police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell them I'm here. Whenever they get ready to come for me,
I'm here. I can't tell them nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, meanwhile, said the limo driver, employed by All
Stretched Out Limo in Baltimore, was the first and only solid
witness thus far to give police any statements.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett's friends and attorney have told reporters Fassett
insists Lewis is had no role in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Fassett probably does not understand Georgia
law and is not aware a person can be charged with a crime even if
they did not directly commit it, but were present and aware of it.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta detectives would not elaborate, but said the murder
charges could have stemmed from the fact that Lewis ``was there, he
knew what happened and he never called police,'' investigators
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Lewis) was the last witness to come forward,'' an Atlanta
Criminal Investigations Division detective told a reporter Friday.
``The longer you wait to call police, the worse it is.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday afternoon, one of Lewis' attorneys _
Jana Harris _ said witnesses had told the defense team Lewis was
seen ``shepherding people into the limousine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The witness said Lewis had some knowledge of what happened and
was saying `C'mon let's go,''' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris criticized Atlanta homicide investigators for arresting
Lewis and charging him with murder based on the testimony of one
witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only charging document we have from police at this
time,'' Harris said waving the two-page document before reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who works with attorney Ed Garland, said her office has
several private investigators working on the case. The Baltimore
Ravens also have hired a private investigator, who is a former
Atlanta police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Johnson said he learned about the double murder on
the news. He said it was snowing and several friends could not
attend the Super Bowl party at his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand this. I had class (at 6 p.m.) on Monday. I
wasn't going down to Atlanta and partying if I had class on
Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Baltimore County Deputy State's Attorney Howard
Merker said he was postponing a hearing and considering dropping an
assault charge against Lewis for allegedly hitting a woman in a
bar.
</P>
<P>
   Merker said Friday he had received ``fairly substantial and
pretty convincing'' statements from 15 to 20 witnesses who said
Lewis did not attack the 24-year-old woman. Merker postponed a Feb.
9 hearing on the charge to give the woman a chance to provide
statements supporting her story.

BEGAY SHOWS HIS TALENT AND HIS CHARACTER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ Later this month, Notah Begay will begin
serving seven days in jail for aggravated drunken driving, an
embarrassing incident that has forced him to take an introspective
look at himself and his life.
</P>
<P>
   Begay has accepted responsibility since his arrest, answering
numerous questions from reporters, speaking to children at schools,
admitting his mistakes, hoping to make amends instead of excuses.
</P>
<P>
   That straightforward approach shows something about Begay's
character, but what he did Friday showed his talent. Making a
hole-in-one on the sixth hole at Poppy Hills Golf Course, Begay
shot a 6-under-par 66 and was tied for the lead after Friday's
first round of the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am.
</P>
<P>
   Begay was tied with David Duval and Vijay Singh, who both shot
66 at Poppy Hills Golf Course, the least difficult of the
tournament's three courses. Tiger Woods was in a four-way tie for
fourth place after his 68 at Poppy Hills, trying to become the
first player since Ben Hogan in 1948 to win six consecutive tour
events. Also at 68 were Lee Janzen, who played at Pebble Beach,
Steve Scott, who played at Poppy Hills, and Grant Waite, who played
at Spyglass Hill.
</P>
<P>
   At least for one day, it did not rain at Pebble Beach, so
Thursday's rain-shortened first round was completed Friday.
Tournament officials still hoped to finish 72 holes by Monday,
although the weather on the Monterey Peninsula can change more
quickly than the leader board.
</P>
<P>
   For Begay, Friday's round was a therapeutic experience, a chance
to forget about the turmoil of the past two weeks. He was arrested
on Jan. 19 in New Mexico after colliding with a parked car in the
parking lot of a bar. During his subsequent hearing, Begay
volunteered that he had also been arrested in 1995 for driving
while intoxicated, although he was not required to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was wrong to be judged for my first offense when
it was in fact my second,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It has been difficult for Begay to focus on golf, but Friday he
showed the form that earned him two victories and more than $1.25
million during his rookie season on tour. The only Native American
on tour, Begay has been a role model for children and a hero in his
hometown, Albuquerque. That stature made his arrest more
regrettable, but he has slowly regrouped.
</P>
<P>
   ``With everything that has been going on in my personal life, it
has been difficult to get back to focusing on golf,'' said Begay,
27, a former teammate of Woods at Stanford. ``The hardest part was
dealing with the disappointment in myself. For about three days
after the incident, I wasn't interested in playing golf. But when I
got back to playing, all the players gave me a pat on the back and
said keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   Begay, who shot a 59 in 1998 on the Nike Tour, used a 6-iron
from 168 yards for his hole-in-one on No. 6, and he also made an
eagle at No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Those stroke-savers allowed Begay to stay ahead of Woods, who
birdied five of the eight holes he played Friday to complete his
first round with a flourish. The most bizarre part of Woods' round
occurred on his tee shot at No. 16, when the club head on his
driver snapped at the bottom of the shaft at impact. The club head
flew about 60 yards in the air, but Woods' tee shot still carried
about 270 yards down the fairway. His next shot landed 15 feet from
the pin, and he made the putt for a birdie, showing that not even a
broken driver can stop Woods these days.
</P>
<P>
   If the weather allows, an interesting tournament will develop,
with a leader board full of heavyweights. Duval is the world's No.
2-ranked player, Singh won the 1998 PGA Championship, and Janzen is
a two-time winner of the U.S. Open. For added interest there is
Scott, playing his first tournament as a professional, who is best
remembered for losing to Woods in the championship match for the
1996 U.S. Amateur title.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be a special victory for Begay, who once caddied at
the Pebble Beach tournament. The last few weeks have been difficult
for Begay. Friday was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake, and I've been trying to do the right thing
ever since,'' Begay said. ``I've gotten a lot of positive
reinforcement from the guys out here. Winning this would really be
special.'' &QL;

   DENVER _ Two weeks before he was shot to death at Columbine High
School, Daniel Mauser approached his father, Tom, as the family
gathered in the kitchen for dinner and asked if he was aware of the
gun show loophole in the Brady crime bill.
</P>
<P>
   Mauser, an official with the Colorado Department of
Transportation who did not consider himself especially political,
knew something about the issue. But the question from his son
seemed to come from out of the blue and surprised Mauser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured he had read something about it,'' Mauser said in an
interview this week. ``But we spent no time talking about it. Now I
look back and think, `Oh, my God.' It's the biggest issue in my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   More than the violence at Columbine, where two students shot and
killed Daniel and a dozen others and then themselves using weapons
bought at a weekend gun show, it was Daniel's offhanded question
that night last April that propelled Mauser into the vortex of gun
politics in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Among all the relatives of Columbine victims, he has become the
state's most ardent and visible campaigner for new laws that would
make it harder for children and criminals to get guns. On a year's
leave from his state job, he serves as director of political
affairs for a new statewide organization, Sane Alternatives to the
Firearms Epidemic, or SAFE, and is registered with the state as a
lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Now, his life is consumed by politics, generating support for
new laws any way he can, speaking to large groups, testifying
before statehouse committees, even accepting an invitation to
attend President Clinton's State of the Union address last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction was, I can't go,'' Mauser said.
</P>
<P>
   An important gun bill was scheduled for debate in the Colorado
Legislature the same day, and he felt the need to testify. But then
he decided his presence in Washington might help call attention to
his mission even if Clinton did not acknowledge him in the gallery
in the speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``My seat was in the second row, behind Hank Aaron,'' Mauser
said. ``I made the assumption that only people in the front row
would be recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   He was wrong. Halfway through the address, as he made his pitch
for national gun control legislation, Clinton recognized Daniel as
``an amazing kid, a straight-A student, a good skier'' and his
father as someone who ``has found the strength to honor his son by
transforming his grief into action.'' He asked Mauser to stand and
be recognized.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he said Daniel's name, I was surprised I didn't lose
it,'' Mauser said. ``It was so, so special to hear Daniel's name
echoed across the country. Honoring Daniel, that was real
special.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauser was invited to the White House reception that followed.
Leaving the Capitol, he unexpectedly encountered Speaker Dennis
Hastert and Rep. Dick Armey, the majority leader. Ever the
lobbyist, Mauser said: ``Nice to meet you. Would you please close
the gun show loophole?''
</P>
<P>
   He laughed at the retelling and said, ``They must have thought I
was crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Little in his life ever suggested Mauser would thrust himself
into the extroverted role of a lobbyist for an emotional cause. A
quiet, unassuming man from Finleyville, Pa., who will celebrate his
12th birthday this month _ he was a leap year baby in 1952 _ he
moved to Colorado in the mid 1970s with a master's degree in public
administration and found work with various organizations, helping
elderly and disabled people with transportation needs. That led to
a position in 1986 with the state, managing highway and rail
programs that benefit the same constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbine shootings turned his world inside out. But it is
an important distinction, he emphasized, that his motivation for
seeking new legislation flows not so much from the shootings, but
from Daniel's question.
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 days after the shootings, at a meeting of the National
Rifle Association in Denver, he joined 12,000 people at a protest,
carrying a sign that read, ``My son would want me to be here.''
Then on Mother's Day, he joined Hillary Rodham Clinton in a White
House discussion group on gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   But all that was window dressing compared with the task at hand.
The Columbine shootings pushed Colorado into a whipsaw of
confusion, a Western state where gun rights were taken for granted
still processing the worst school killings in American history.
State lawmakers have flooded their chambers with gun legislation,
21 bills so far, including one that would close the gun show
loophole by making Colorado the first state to require background
checks for anyone buying a gun from a private dealer or collector
at a gun show.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the measure, including Gov. Bill Owens, a
Republican, contend that it would help keep guns out of the wrong
hands. Their argument was underscored last week when Robyn
Anderson, who bought three of the guns at a weekend gun show that
were used by the Columbine killers, told a state House committee
that if she had had to submit to a background check, she would not
have bought them.
</P>
<P>
   Such an alternative course of events is almost too painful for
Mauser to contemplate. It is difficult enough, he said, keeping his
emotions separate from the pragmatic needs of wrangling with
lawmakers over issues that have so dramatically changed his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly you've put yourself and your job together. It's not,
by any means, natural, a very emotional layer tied to an issue,''
he said. `'It's draining. When I go home, I'm exhausted, extremely
exhausted. I have trouble sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
   But Daniel's question, he said, ever reverberating inside,
pushes him to consider the future, not what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not reactive, we're proactive,'' he said of his mission.
``I can't do anything about Daniel. But in his name, I can do
something so this doesn't happen to anyone else.''

USOC PUTS BUSINESS AHEAD OF SPORTS IN SELECTING CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Olympic Committee Friday chose Norman P. Blake Jr., a
veteran financial executive, to run an organization that admitted
it failed to oversee Salt Lake City's scandal-pocked bid for the
2002 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, 58, becomes the president and chief executive officer, a
new post with more power than the executive director's position,
which has been held by Dick Schultz, since 1995. Schultz is
retiring, and William Hybl, who has been the volunteer president,
will be the chairman through the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very clear from being an enthusiast and an observer that
there was a loss of credibility and a lack of competence in the
management of the USOC in terms of their oversight,'' Blake said by
telephone from Chicago, where his appointment was approved by the
executive committee of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, who will start work Monday, added: ``I'm a strong leader
who knows how to manage an organization, develop a culture and
drive performance. Something like Salt Lake City was clearly a
management issue. There weren't adequate controls and
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the USOC wants to curb the excesses of cities bidding
to play host to future Olympic Games. A report by a commission
headed by George Mitchell, the former U.S. senator, excoriated the
USOC for not exercising control over Salt Lake City organizers, who
campaigned to win the Games with a program of illicit gift-giving
to International Olympic Committee members.
</P>
<P>
   By signing Blake to a three-year contract, the USOC signaled
that it needed an executive with a high level of corporate
experience rather than someone with a sports background, like
Schultz. The USOC's budget has grown from $13 million during the
1976-80 quadrennium to the current $441 million.
</P>
<P>
   Two other candidates were Marla Messing, the chief executive
officer of last year's women's World Cup, and Pete Dawkins, the
former Heisman Trophy winner, retired brigadier general and
business executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing we wanted was someone with experience running
a large, complex organization, and somebody who's an agent of
change,'' said Mike McManus, a member of the search committee.
``This is a voluntary, nonprofit organization, but it's so big,
it's like a large corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   A report by McKinsey &AMP; Co., a management consulting firm, about
restructuring the USOC, suggested several changes in its
governance, including the creation of a powerful presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm attracted to making sure the USOC staff is of equal
quality to the athletes,'' Blake said.
</P>
<P>
   Blake most recently served as the chairman and chief executive
officer of the Promus Hotel Corp., until its acquisition last
November by the Hilton Hotels Corp. for $3.1 billion. Before that,
he was the chairman of the USF&AMP;G Corp., a troubled insurer that he
steered from the brink of bankruptcy to being purchased for $2.8
billion by the St. Paul Companies. He was also an executive vice
president of the General Electric Credit Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Blake said his management style was influenced by Jack Welch,
GE's chairman, who is frequently hailed as one of corporate
America's best managers. ``He has a great sense of reading a
business situation, understanding the gut issue and very quickly
developing a strategy to address an issue,'' Blake said. ``In some
ways, that rubbed off on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he developed a reputation as a turnaround expert, Blake
was reluctant to describe the USOC as requiring a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to use that word,'' he said. ``But by the board acting
as it did, they realized something had to be done, and part of the
problem was the governance. It's one thing to pass a bunch of
bylaws or change the constitution, but it doesn't work unless I do
my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake's appointment requires one more step before it becomes
official: the 111-member USOC board's approval of changes to its
constitution, which is expected to happen Saturday.

REFORM PARTY CASTS AN EYE ON A MCCAIN-BRADLEY TICKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Democratic and Republican challengers are not just
attracting attention in their own parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten a bunch of calls from people saying, `Wouldn't
John McCain and Bill Bradley be something as our ticket,''' said
Jack Gargan, the Reform Party chairman, who has no idea who might
emerge as his party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   For now, a dozen people have declared their intention to carry
the Reform banner, but only Pat Buchanan, the former Republican and
conservative commentator, has any kind of name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Perot, the billionaire Texan who founded the party and was
its nominee in 1992 and 1996, is said to be mulling over another
run. Donald Trump, the New York real estate developer, is also
considering it.
</P>
<P>
   But none of them would infuse the Reform Party with the kind of
mainstream cache and credibility that McCain of Arizona and former
Sen. Bradley of New Jersey could provide, judging by the trouble
they are creating for the Republican and Democratic presumptive
front-runners, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of either McCain's or Bradley's joining the Reform
effort, let alone as a ticket, has Gargan salivating, despite his
professed neutrality. As party chairman, he insisted, he can
neither show favoritism nor recruit presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The only way for any candidate to seek the party's nomination is
to express an interest to party officials or notify the Reform
presidential nominating committee.
</P>
<P>
   `'I can't call them, and as far as I know they haven't contacted
us,'' Gargan said. `'But I will say this. Any national figure with
such a pro-reform background as John McCain would certainly be
welcome as our party's candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   And if he wants to bring along Bradley, so much the better.

one of the first designers to create and popularize that uniquely
American approach to dress called sportswear, died Thursday after
open heart surgery at New York University Medical Center. She was
84 and lived in Manhattan. Ms. Cashin was one of a handful of women
in the 1940s and 1950s who made an important contribution to
American fashion, at a time when Parisian couturiers dominated the
runways and supplied most of the original fashions for
manufacturers to copy. (Bill Aller/The New York Times)

<P>
   HOUSTON _ A 4-year-old Arizona boy with brain cancer is at the
center of a national debate over medical freedom of choice because
a federal agency has refused to let him be treated by controversial
Houston doctor Stanislaw Burzynski.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the support of the Republican presidential candidates,
James and Donna Navarro have been unable to persuade the Food and
Drug Administration to let their son Thomas be treated with
antineoplastons, Burzynski's nontoxic alternative therapy, without
having first tried chemotherapy and radiation without success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medical mafia is thwarting what should be our freedom to
make intelligent decisions based on research,'' said James Navarro,
formerly a small-business owner from Tuscon, Ariz. ``Doctors who
have taken the Hippocratic oath have been less than honest with us
and portrayed as emotionally unstable zealots because we prefer a
doctor whose treatment itself won't ravage our son.''
</P>
<P>
   Conventional doctors want Navarro to follow the established
regimen of chemotherapy and radiation, which they say ``cures''
(meaning, still alive 5 years later) children in 50 to 70 percent
of cases with Thomas' particular kind of brain tumor, depending on
age. Besides the usual side effects of fatigue, hair loss, skin
rash and nausea, it also can cause hearing loss, spinal growth
deficit, hypothyroidism and mental retardation.
</P>
<P>
   Burzynski says his antineoplastons, a synthesized version of
human peptides found in blood and urine, can be an effective cancer
treatment without debilitating and lasting effects. But there is
only anectdotal evidence it works, because Burzynski has never done
clinically approved trials.
</P>
<P>
   Burzynski's use of antineoplastons caused a decades-long feud
with the government that culminated in 1997, when he was acquitted
of the last of 75 federal charges related to the interstate
shipment of the drug. But he is only now allowed to prescribe
antineoplastons in FDA-approved clinical trials; before trying the
treatment on brain cancer, patients must already have failed to
progress on chemotherapy and radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro's cause has been trumpeted by Republican presidential
candidate and former Ambassador Alan Keyes, who made it the subject
of a closing statement at one debate and opening statement at
another attended by the family.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes wrote a letter _ also signed by John McCain, George Bush,
Gary Bauer, Steve Forbes and Orrin Hatch _ to Health and Human
Services Secretary Donna Shalala, calling on her to allow immediate
antineoplaston treatment by Burzynski.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be the right of every responsible American citizen
to seek the medical care of their choice without government
bureaucracies standing in their way,'' wrote Keyes. ``Time is
running out for Thomas Navarro and for countless Americans like
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Though James Navarro said negotiations are under way, an FDA
spokesman said Friday he was not aware of any agency response to
the letter or a similar one to the FDA from Rep.  &UR;  &LR; Dan Burton,
R-Ind. The spokesman stressed that the FDA is a scientific
regulatory agency, not a political body.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no scientific or medical justification for approving
or even condoning the use of an unproven, potential therapy when a
very effective treatment exists and has become, in fact, a
universally recognized standard of care,'' Richard Pazdur, director
of the FDA's Division of Oncology Drug Products, told The Cancer
Letter. ``Ethically, giving a child an experimental product in such
circumstances flies in the face of all the guidelines and
regulations designed to protect children as research subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navarros met last week with doctors at the University of
Texas-M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston but nothing came of
it. In the meeting, arranged by Texas Commissioner of Health
William R. Archer III at the behest of Gov. George Bush, doctors
said they could treat the tumor with lower dosages and great
attention to alleviating side effects.
</P>
<P>
   But although James Navarro said he was impressed with the
honesty of those doctors _ his former doctors in Arizona only
grudgingly responded to questions about the effects of chemotherapy
and radiation, he said _ he and his wife left the meeting convinced
Burzynski remains their son's best option.
</P>
<P>
   Two studies are commonly cited about the effectiveness of
chemotherapy and radiation. One, which studied children from
infancy to 4 years of age, reported a five-year survival rate of 51
percent, significant neuropsychologic injury and a high rate of
disease recurrence. Another, which studied children from 3 to 10,
reported a survival rate of 70 percent, much less neuropsychologic
injury and a 10 percent rate of recurrence. Doctors say the child
fares better the older he or she is.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro said he believes studies are manipulated to sell a
product _ ``otherwise, people wouldn't be dying of cancer every 60
seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   At the FDA's request, Burzynski submitted a alternative therapy
protocol under which the Navarros wouldn't need to do chemotherapy
and radiation first, but it was rejected. He said it'd take 57
years to treat enough patients with the same tumor as Navarro's to
satisfy the FDA's rules for treating Navarro without prior
conventional treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But Burzynski said he believes a way will be found to allow him
to treat Navarro. ``I don't think the FDA will fight this to the
end,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Navarros have been in Houston since Nov. 10, less than two
month after conventional doctors in Arizona discovered Thomas had
medulloblastoma, performed surgery to remove it and then finally
told them about some of the typical effects of chemotherapy and
radiation. With any follow-up treatment, disease recurrence kills
90 percent of patients in 1 year and the remaining 10 percent in 2
years, the FDA says.
</P>
<P>
   The Navarros say they fear returning to Arizona because their
former doctors in Arizona have reported them to Child Protective
Services, which requested an interview with them through their
attorney. James Navarro said such cases usually lead to CPS taking
the child. A CPS spokesman in Arizona would not confirm the agency
had any such plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Navarro boy's condition was initially diagnosed as the flu,
but his persistent symptoms progressed into vision problems and
increased lethargy. An MRI scan during a second exam revealed the
tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery two days later was successful but initially left the boy
with ``no speech, no sight and no ability to walk,'' said his
father. Though those functions came back over time, ``his cognitive
skills are still lacking _ he's like a 4-year-old newborn in many
ways.'' That's the primary reason, his parents say, they don't want
to subject him to further toxic effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas is such a special kid that everyone who meets him falls
in love with him,'' said James Navarro. ``He so loves life. That's
why we don't want to see him lying in bed, writhing in pain, his
senses dulled, his sight, hearing and memory gone and his IQ
diminished.''
</P>
<P>
   Navarro said he hopes for a breakthrough soon. But if one isn't
reached in a month, he said, the family will go outside the United
States for treatment.

CLINTON TARGETS ARMS DEALERS, SEEKS FINE ON TOBACCO INDUSTRY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trims, optional ending) 
 
By JOHN C. HENRY 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stepping up his campaign against guns and
cigarettes, President Clinton launched a crackdown Friday on
firearms dealers whose weapons are used in crimes and proposed a
$3,000 fine against the tobacco industry for each teen smoker.
</P>
<P>
   The president released a federal study that found about 1
percent of the nation's gun dealers and pawnbrokers sell 57 percent
of the guns that wind up in the hands of criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're beginning the most aggressive effort ever undertaken to
ensure responsible behavior by gun dealers,'' said Clinton.
``Dealers whose guns most frequently wind up in criminals' hands
will now be subject to intense scrutiny'' by federal law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   On the tobacco front, White House officials outlined plans by
the president to ask Congress for a new, 25-cent-a-pack tax on
cigarettes, and a fine against tobacco companies aimed at reducing
the number of young smokers.
</P>
<P>
   The fine would amount to $3,000 for each smoker under age 18 if
the number of underage smokers is not reduced by half in the next
four years. The penalty would be assessed against tobacco companies
based on their share of the smoking market.
</P>
<P>
   The two proposals drew sharp criticism from industry
representatives, foreshadowing the election-year fight to come.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-led Congress rebuffed Clinton's push last year
for tougher restrictions on gun show sales and a 55-cent increase
in cigarette taxes. In 1998, another of the president's
anti-smoking measures was similarly rejected by lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control is high on Clinton's agenda this year as he hopes _
in addition to curbing access to guns _ to provide Vice President
Al Gore and other Democratic candidates with an issue to use in
their campaigns against Republicans, who tend to oppose gun-control
measures.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's stepped-up effort against rogue gun dealers is
mostly an issue of refocusing the resources of the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the president plans to ask Congress
to expand the agency's powers and to provide $280 million to hire
more ATF agents and federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The president also wants Congress to change federal law that
prohibits ATF from inspecting gun dealers more than once a year.
Clinton wants the agency to be allowed three surprise inspections
annually.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Clinton ordered the ATF to conduct so-called
``focused inspections'' at about 1,020 of the nation's 83,272
licensed firearms dealers who over the last year each sold at least
10 guns linked to crimes. The firearms study released by Clinton
found 132 dealers each sold 50 or more guns that were used by
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``When 12 children are dying every day in America because of gun
violence, we can't wait for congressional action,'' Clinton told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union speech last week, the president called
for Congress to pass legislation requiring photo licenses by state
governments showing that gun buyers have cleared a background check
and passed a firearms-safety course.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he pledged to renew the fight this year for trigger
locks on handguns and for tighter restrictions on the sale of
weapons at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the president's stepped-up enforcement efforts,
gun-control advocate Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said, ``This is
the best thing that can be done, short of new laws ... given the
deadlock in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   James Baker, chief lobbyist for the National Rifle Association,
said the government already has broad power to police dealers and
raid those suspected of criminal conduct. ``Firearms dealers (are)
some of the most heavily regulated businessmen in the country,''
Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the latest installment in the Clinton/Gore plan
to drive lawful and licensed gun dealers out of business,'' Baker
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, whose department oversees
the ATF, disagreed. ``This is an intensified focus and allocation
of enforcement resources in the most effective ... way,'' he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an approach that is in any way punitive with
respect to guns in general,'' Summers said. ``But it is an approach
of assuring that our resources are targeted effectively as possible
at reducing the incidence of gun crime.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his proposed 2001 budget, which goes to Congress on Monday,
the president steps up his effort to reduce the number of smokers
in the 12-year-old to 17-year-old age group by asking lawmakers to
increase the costs of cigarettes and put the heat on tobacco
companies to stop marketing to young Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, more than 400,000 Americans die from
tobacco-related diseases. Nearly 90 percent of them started smoking
as children,'' the White House said in a statement outlining the
president's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   By increasing the federal excise tax on a pack of cigarettes by
25 cents, the White House said, minors will be further deterred
from smoking. The current federal levy is 34 cents-a-pack. The
increase would pump an estimated $31.6 billion into the treasury.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 25-cent increase, Clinton wants Congress to
move up to Oct. 1 a 5-cent-a-pack tax hike due to take effect Jan.
1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   John Singleton, a spokesman for North Carolina-based R.J.
Reynolds, said the government already taxes cigarettes enough.
``The federal government makes about seven times more on a pack of
cigarettes than tobacco companies do,'' Singleton said.
</P>
<P>
   A pack of cigarettes generally costs between $3 and $4 depending
on taxes levied by state governments.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage tobacco companies to stop appealing to underage
smokers, Clinton wants to penalize cigarette-makers $3,000 each
year for every underage smoker if teen-smoking is not cut in half
by 2004. A similar plan was killed by Senate Republicans in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly our belief that the tobacco industry, through
their marketing practices, could cut teen smoking,'' said White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Pheil, a spokesman for Philip Morris, the nation's largest
cigarette maker, said the $3,000 fine amounts to a confiscation of
property that probably is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly would believe we would have a basis for
challenging this on its constitutionality,'' Pheil said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Seffrin, chief executive officer for the American Cancer
Society, lauded Clinton's proposals. ``The tobacco industry claims
to want to reduce teen tobacco use,'' Seffrin said. This plan would
light a fire under Big Tobacco and force them to back up their
words with action.''

BUSH BEGINS TAKING SHOTS AT MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. _ In a new offensive against his surging
opponent, Gov. George W. Bush Friday attacked Sen. John McCain for
accepting campaign contributions from corporations he helps
regulate as head of the Senate Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who suffered a numbing defeat at the hands of McCain in
the New Hampshire primary, also unveiled a new television spot that
included some of the harshest criticism to date of his rival.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing McCain of ``Washington double talk,'' Bush said his
actions as head of the commerce committee seemed to clash with his
image as the champion of campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a person who's a committee chairman,'' Bush said. ``He's
used his positions skillfully to forward his campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also referred to news reports that McCain intervened with
federal regulators on behalf of a company whose plane he used to
travel to campaign events. ``When you're chairman of the commerce
committee, one is capable of finding people to fly you on their
airplanes and very capable of using that position to raise money,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new Bush spot began running Friday night in South Carolina
and is the first Bush commercial that attacks McCain by name. It
criticizes a three-week-old McCain commercial in which the senator
asserted that ``the one big difference'' between him and the other
candidates was that ``I won't take every last dime of the surplus
and spend it on tax cuts that mostly benefit the wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Bush commercial, an announcer says, ``John McCain's ad
about Governor Bush's tax plan isn't true, and McCain knows it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's economic adviser says he would support Bush's plan _ $2
trillion to protect Social Security, pay down debt and a real tax
cut. ``McCain's plan?'' it continues. ``A tax cut smaller than
Clinton's. And not a penny in tax cuts for 30 million Americans.''

U.S. BLACK HAWKS UP AND FLYING IN COLOMBIA'S WAR ON DRUGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN OTIS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEIVA, Colombia _ As a crop-duster darted between mountain peaks
in search of bright red poppy fields Friday, three U.S.-supplied
Black Hawk helicopters hovered nearby, their guns trained on the
tree line.
</P>
<P>
   Lethal new weapons in Colombia's war on drugs, the copters were
sent to this South American nation in November as part of a U.S.
military aid package. The helicopters ran their first
anti-narcotics mission on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these Black Hawks, the drug traffickers will tremble,''
said Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano, chief of Colombia's national police
force.
</P>
<P>
   Three more Black Hawks are scheduled to arrive from the United
States in March. In the meantime, the U.S. Congress is debating
President Clinton's two-year, $1.6 billion aid proposal for
Colombia that includes 30 additional Black Hawks and 32 upgraded
``Super-Huey'' choppers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in both Washington and Bogota acknowledge that the
need for sophisticated aircraft reflects the growing dangers in
Colombia's controversial, five-year effort to eradicate opium
poppies and coca leaves, the raw materials for heroin and cocaine.
Attacks against spray planes and escort choppers have jumped
dramatically in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   As police pilots swoop low over the narcotics crops, they often
draw fire from traffickers as well as Marxist guerrillas, who fund
their 36-year-old war against the government, in part, with
drug-protection money.
</P>
<P>
   Equipped with 50-caliber machine guns and infrared sensors to
spot the enemy on the ground, the Black Hawks provide a menacing
escort for the unarmed crop-dusters.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Colombia's aging fleet of Vietnam War-era Huey
helicopters, the Black Hawks can fly at altitudes of up to 20,000
feet. That makes them more effective during raids on opium poppies,
which grow high in the Andes Mountains of western Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think air power will mean the difference in the war,'' said
Colombian Defense Minister Luis Fernando Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, drug traffickers have shot at police pilots
with rocket-propelled grenades on eight occasions, Ramirez said
during an interview in Neiva, the capital of Huila state, which is
infested with poppies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing more and more attacks from the ground when the
planes come in to fumigate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1990s, dozens of pilots and helicopter crew
members have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``These operations are very difficult,'' said Serrano, the
Colombian police chief. ``It's suicidal.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also unclear whether the fumigation strategy works.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, police fumigated 20,000 acres of poppies and 106,000
acres of coca. Yet farmers often replanted the crops almost
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Colombia produced 6.5 metric tons of heroin and 435
metric tons of cocaine in 1999. The South American country remains
the United States' principle source for both drugs, according to
the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Ramirez said, a new policy by the Colombian air
force to interdict drug aircraft has paid off. In the past two
years, 36 drug flights have been forced down, and six planes have
been shot out of the sky, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez likes the Colombian policy, because it focuses on
high-level drug traffickers rather than poor farmers, who often
grow drug crops just to survive
</P>
<P>
   ``It's less confrontational with local farmers and directly
hurts the wholesaler,'' Ramirez said.

LEAK WAS A SMEAR, ARPAIO AIDES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE MCCLOY  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors leaked a
report on credit-card abuse from a secret meeting in order to smear
Chief Deputy Dave Hendershott, sher iff's aides said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The leak emerged in a newspa per story Friday, two days after
Sheriff Joe Arpaio and four su pervisors met in executive ses sion
on Hendershott's salary.
</P>
<P>
   The board had reduced Hen dershott's $120,000 annual pay in
November to offset $51,000 in pension benefits be began draw ing
after momentarily retiring in September.
</P>
<P>
   Hendershott sued and a Supe rior Court judge upheld his dou ble
dip, ordering the board to negotiate a new salary.
</P>
<P>
   Improper use of county pur chasing cards apparently arose in the
negotiations as Hendershott's performance was discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was an executive session violation, that would be a
viola tion of the law and we would investigate that,'' said Jack
Mac Intyre, an attorney for Arpaio.
</P>
<P>
   Board of Supervisors Chair man Andy Kunasek said he also is
considering an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If indeed it was a leak out of the session, I intend to find
out exactly what happened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The secret salary talks could resume Feb. 16, Kunasek said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune said Hendershott, Chief Financial Officer Glen
Christenson and Larry Farn sworth, property-management di vision
commander, were accused of misusing their county-issued purchasing
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Among the purchases ques tioned by the county Materials
Management Department were a $1,300 leather office chair for
Hendershott, $12,000 worth of leased motorcycles for a sheriff's
patrol and $2,000 in computer equipment.
</P>
<P>
   County officials were advised to not comment on the audit
because Hendershott could sue again.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's spokeswoman Lisa Al len said Christenson repaid $29
for a meal at Hooters he charged on a county card.
</P>
<P>
   But all the other purchases are legitimate sheriff's equipment
from suppliers on contract with the county, Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   She also said a private party picked up the tab for the cycle
leases to settle that dispute and keep the patrol going for a
year. &QL;

COR THERAPEUTICS RISES 59 PERCENT AFTER TRIAL OF A HEART DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Shares in Cor Therapeutics Inc. soared Friday
after the company disclosed that its heart drug Integrilin had
performed so well in a clinical trial that the test had been ended
ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The study was halted after an analysis showed an almost 50
percent reduction in death or heart attack 30 days after a stent, a
device used to prop open an artery after balloon angioplasty, had
been implanted and patients began taking Integrilin.
</P>
<P>
   The drug was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in
1998 for the treatment of unstable angina, the acute chest pains
that can precede heart attacks, and for patients receiving balloon
angioplasty to open clogged arteries.
</P>
<P>
   But Integrilin, which is co-marketed by Cor and the
Schering-Plough Corp., has lagged in sales behind Reopro, a drug
produced by the Centocor unit of Johnson &AMP; Johnson that is more
expensive but is believed to be more potent. Analysts said the
early conclusion of the trial and the positive outcome for patients
should increase Integrilin sales.
</P>
<P>
   Like aspirin, Integrilin inhibits the accumulation of blood
platelets that can block the flow of oxygen to the heart, but it is
more potent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cor has recognized that in our industry, data speak more
loudly than anything else and the data translate into money,'' said
Viren Mehta, an analyst with Mehta Partners. ``Clearly Reopro has a
fantastic database. Cor has recognized that they must be patient
and begin to compile a database that will be competitive against
Reopro. This is a very good beginning in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Cor shares closed at $40.50, up $14.9375, or nearly 59 percent,
in Nasdaq trading. Cor shares have traded as low as $8.125 in the
last 52 weeks. Friday's gains followed a 20 percent drop on Jan.
26, after the company, which is based in South San Francisco,
reported fourth-quarter Integrilin sales that were below analysts'
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The test was halted, in a standard procedure, because it was
considered unethical to continue giving a placebo to half the
patients when the drug had proved effective.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500,000 angioplasty procedures are performed in the
United States each year to restore blood flow through occluded
arteries that supply oxygen to the heart. More than 60 percent of
all these procedures use stents, metal mesh structures that hold
the artery open after the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Although generally successful at restoring blood flow and
preventing the collapse of the artery, the deployment of the stent
into the artery wall can result in the clumping of blood cells
called platelets and the development of a blood clot within the
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Integrilin helps prevent heart attack and death by blocking
certain receptors on platelets that are responsible for clot
development. The effects of Integrilin are specific to platelets
and thus do not interfere with other normal cardiovascular
processes and can be reversed. &QL;

EX-ARMY MEDIC SAYS COURT-MARTIAL UNFAIR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Army medic Michael New, who was kicked out
for disobeying an order, argued Friday that his court-martial was
unfair because the jury was not allowed to consider whether
President Clinton illegally ordered U.S. soldiers to serve as U.N.
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing before the military's highest court, New's lawyer, Henry
Hamilton, said the Conroe, Texas, resident was philosophically
opposed to wearing the United Nations insignia and felt that
Clinton could not legally order U.S. troops to serve under U.N.
command.
</P>
<P>
   ``Superiors may not compel subordinates to obey illegal
orders,'' said Hamilton, arguing that Clinton's order to deploy
troops to Macedonia in 1995 had not been approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, a retired Army lawyer, said the judge overseeing New's
court martial erred when he told the jury that Clinton's order was
constitutional and not allowing the panel to make that decision.
``If it's not a legal order, there's no duty to obey it,'' Hamilton
said.
</P>
<P>
   From their questions, at least two of the five judges seemed to
agree with Hamilton's assertion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole trial was about whether the order was lawful,'' said
Judge Eugene R. Sullivan. ``Is this a legal order or not? This
question should be passed on to the jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Army Capt. Kelly Haywood argued that the legitimacy of the order
was properly decided by Army Judge Lt. Col. Gary Jewell, who
presided at New's court martial in January 1996. ``If (the order)
was unlawful, the judge would have dismissed the case,'' Haywood
said.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Andrew Effron appeared unconvinced. If the military is to
have a separate system of justice, ``why can't we trust a military
panel to determine if an order is legal?'' Effron asked, throwing
Haywood off-stride.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Robinson Everett came to the government's defense.
``Wouldn't that result in chaos if every order has to be determined
to be lawful before it is obeyed?'' Everett asked.
</P>
<P>
   Haywood said: ``The mission lives and dies by the soldier
following an order.''
</P>
<P>
   New was among several hundred Army personnel Clinton dispatched
to Macedonia, at the time one of six republics of Yugoslavia, as
part of a U.N. peacekeeping mission to guard against the spread of
ethnic unrest. He refused a commander's order to wear the U.N.
insignia and blue beret.
</P>
<P>
   At his court martial, the jury took 20 minutes to convict him of
disobeying an order. He was sentenced to a bad-conduct discharge
from the Army, a penalty that has been put on hold until he
exhausts his appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The five judges who heard New's case Friday are civilian jurists
appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. If they
refuse to order a new trial, New can appeal to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse Friday, Hamilton was more strident in his
challenge of Clinton's order deploying U.S. troops as part of the
U.N. contingent.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton lied to Congress about the lawfulness of the
deployment to Macedonia,'' the lawyer said. ``He was lying about
the deployment to avoid the rigors of congressional scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   New, who is on unpaid leave pending the outcome of his court
fight, said the key issue for him ``is whether or not it's illegal
for a soldier to wear the uniform of foreign nations, under foreign
commanders.''
</P>
<P>
   New lives in Conroe, north of Houston, and is working and going
to school part time. He is on probation for a January 1998
conviction for forging prescriptions in Montgomery County.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1999, New was arrested on charges of phoning in a fake
prescription for a drug used to aid people suffering from anxiety.
If convicted on the drug charge, he faces up to 10 years in prison.

USC LOOKING FOR MORE ENERGY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It wasn't just that USC shot poorly or dropped its
first home game that was distressing about its loss to California
on Thursday, it was the listless manner the Trojans displayed that
concerned players and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a flat game. We came out with no energy,'' USC coach
Henry Bibby said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody was out of sync,'' forward David Bluthenthal
added. ``They came out with more energy and set the tone.''
</P>
<P>
   These were the last comments the Trojans expected to make
entering the game, especially after an impressive victory over
Oregon State last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had good practices,'' point guard Brandon
Granville said. ``Everyone seemed excited. This is a game where you
thought everyone would get it going early.''
</P>
<P>
   Tough road: USC's NCAA hopes took a shot with the loss to Cal.
The Trojans will be decided underdogs against No. 2 Stanford
tonight at the Sports Arena, then have to play three straight road
games: At UCLA, Arizona and Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming USC loses to Stanford, the Trojans will have to win
their four remaining home games against the Oregon and Washington
schools and at least one road victory to reach the magical
18-victory mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed because I thought the Cal game was a
game we could win,'' Bibby said. ``You can't go on the road and get
a split and then lose the first game you play at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans remained optimistic they could rebound after the
four-point loss to Cal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think we had a bad game,'' Bluthenthal said. ``We're
still capable of winning. We have no margin for error against
Stanford.''
</P>
<P>
   Last shot recap: There was some debate about whether USC should
have gone inside to leading scorer Brian Scalabrine on its final
three possessions, while trailing Cal by no more than two points.
Instead, little-used guard Rashad Jones attempted a shot, Granville
took a 3-pointer and freshman guard Nate Hair took a 3-pointer with
less than four seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was open for a last-second shot, Scalabrine said,
``I didn't get the ball so I'm pretty sure I wasn't. I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby said he was just trying to get an open jumper on the
Trojans' final possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to get the basketball inside, and then kick it out
and have Brandon or Nate shoot the jump shot,'' he said. ``There
was enough time to get the shot we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad foul: Perhaps the biggest play of the Cal game occurred when
Bluthenthal picked up his fifth foul with 6:26 left. USC's starters
have done a good job avoiding their fifth foul since the injuries
to Clancy and Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a dumb foul,'' Bluthenthal said. ``I was trying to
play hard. I didn't want the fourth foul to keep me from playing
hard.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Battle over military votes likely will characterize S.C. primary
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ To a large extent, South Carolina's critical
Republican presidential primary is about two Navy pilots who were
shot down in combat. One of them isn't even running.
</P>
<P>
   World War II pilot and former President George Bush has retired
from political life. But South Carolinians who back his son, George
W. Bush, more often than not cite his family as a primary reason.
The elder Bush and his wife remain enormously popular here.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain was shot down during the Vietnam War
and spent more than five years in the infamous Hanoi Hilton, a
North Vietnamese prison. Many South Carolinians who back McCain say
the courage he displayed during that ordeal appeals to them.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain differ on taxes and campaign finance reform. But
at a time of peace and unprecedented prosperity, when there is no
single burning issue on the national agenda and many are yearning
for a president who won't disappoint them with personal foibles,
the Feb. 19 primary here is as likely to turn on who the candidates
are as on their policy positions.
</P>
<P>
   About a fifth of likely GOP voters say the candidates' character
is the most important issue _ virtually the same number who say
taxes are their top concern. Bush wins among those who say taxes
are most important while McCain carries voters who believe
``character counts the most,'' according to the Rasmussen Research
poll, conducted Feb. 2. The poll surveyed 665 likely GOP primary
voters and has a margin of error of 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Two other supposedly hot-button issues _ education and health
care _ were considered important by 12 percent. Among the least
important issues to voters were campaign finance reform, a McCain
priority, and whether the Confederate battle flag should fly over
the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolinians say duty, honor and family are particularly
important in the Palmetto State, which is overwhelmingly
conservative and has a deeply ingrained military culture thanks to
its large number of veterans and military bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he's the right man, just as I thought his father was
the right man,'' said Ramona Franks, 60, who volunteers in Bush's
Greenville office. ``They seem to believe in family. They believe
in honesty. I just think they are good, moral people.''
</P>
<P>
   During a McCain appearance at the Florence National Guard
Armory, Rhett Dusenbury said he is impressed with McCain's
substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who's had that time in solitary confinement, the time
to do an evaluation in his heart and mind of what liberty and
freedom mean _ that's who I'd take a bullet for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of the 2000 campaign, the South Carolina
primary has loomed large on the calendar. As McCain's insurgent
campaign gained momentum in New Hampshire, Bush strategists
designated South Carolina as a ``firewall'' that would stop his
advance.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's surprising 19-point win in New Hampshire raises the
South Carolina stakes. Late last month, a South Carolina poll
showed Bush with a 51 percent to 29 percent lead over McCain. But
polls released Thursday and Friday show McCain tied with or
surpassing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the main battleground in the nominating
process,'' said Henry McMaster, head of the South Carolina GOP.
``It'll be the biggest primary we've ever had in South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush wasn't the first front-runner to stumble in New Hampshire:
Granite State voters have a history of sticking it to the candidate
anointed by the party establishment and the pundits. Insurgent Pat
Buchanan defeated eventual GOP nominee Bob Dole there in 1996, and
Bush's father almost lost to Buchanan in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolinians, in contrast, have a reputation for picking up
wounded front-runners, dusting them off, and sending them on their
way to the nomination. But the reputation is somewhat undeserved.
There have been only four contested GOP primaries since 1980, and
in one of them, front-runner John Connally, a Texan with lots of
money, a slew of endorsements and the backing of the party
establishment, lost to underdog Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first GOP primary here in 1980, South Carolinians have
crowned the eventual nominee every time.
</P>
<P>
   Clemson University political scientist David Woodard says that's
because South Carolina voters are more typical of the national GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we vote for the establishment, it's that we are
the establishment,'' Woodard said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush appeared visibly relieved to have left snowy New Hampshire
_ and its icy verdict _ when he arrived here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels a lot warmer here, if you know what I mean,'' he told
the crowd at Bob Jones University, a Christian college in
Greenville. Cognizant of his father's popularity, Bush often refers
to South Carolina as ``Bush Country,'' and there are usually plenty
of campaign signs at his events that proclaim it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is also reaching out to social conservatives. Bob Jones
University is a popular stop for Republicans seeking the support of
that group. In introducing Bush at the college, former South
Carolina governor and born-again Christian David Beasley made sure
to tout the Texas governor's anti-abortion record, and Bush played
up the parts of his stump speech that deal with morals and values.
</P>
<P>
   Religious conservatives are a larger force here than they are in
New Hampshire, though they are not as powerful as they are in Iowa,
by most accounts.
</P>
<P>
   During his two days here, Bush also noted that McCain's
criticism of his tax plan _ namely, that it eats up too much of the
surplus and might threaten Social Security _ is similar to attacks
by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call John a liberal, but on key issues he's taken
the Democratic position,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also contrasted his executive experience with
McCain's legislative background in the U.S. Senate. In a state that
was the first to secede from the Union and where many believe the
Civil War was about states' rights, not slavery, anti-Washington
sentiment goes a long way.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, however, Bush's best hope here may be his family
ties.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Ballinger, a retired Air Force colonel who was shot down
over occupied France during World War II and spent a year in a
German prison camp, should be an easy vote for McCain. But after
hearing Bush speak at the Sumter courthouse in an event designed to
show that he won't concede veterans to McCain, Ballinger concluded
that the governor ``looks like a president and sounds like a
president.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows which one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a gut ache about that,'' Ballinger said of the
elder Bush's 1992 defeat. ``I regret deeply that Bush lost. I just
can't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's compelling life story is likely to resonate with
most of the state's roughly 370,000 veterans, which are about 13
percent of the voting-age population.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Grady, the quartermaster at VFW Post 641 in Columbia, said
that reporters who came to a recent meeting hoping to find veterans
who supported both candidates went away disappointed: Only one of
35 said he backed Bush. On Thursday, that one said he was
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for the old man,'' Grady said of Bush's father. ``The
son is probably as good as the old man was, but McCain comes over a
little more honest and a little more upright to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that Bush has raised millions more in campaign
contributions, McCain should be able to compete here because South
Carolina is small and buying air time here is relatively
inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most importantly, the South Carolina GOP primary is open
to anybody, so McCain could attract large numbers of independent
voters, as he did in New Hampshire. Voters here aren't registered
by party and the Democrats won't hold a South Carolina primary, so
McCain may even get Democratic votes as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people will vote in the primary, just to have a
voice,'' said Linda Gremillion of Florence, who attended McCain's
town meeting Friday at the Florence armory. She said she generally
votes Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Several at Friday's event said they liked McCain's promise to
``break this iron triangle in Washington of money, lobbyists and
legislation,'' but they seemed more impressed by what that promise
implied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just total authenticity,'' Dusenbury said. ``He's
totally driven by doing what's best for the people of the United
States.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Martin Munoz, his wife and two children live in a
home the couple fashioned around a broken-down school bus and a
camper trailer. Just across the way, a fighting cock is tethered
near another home, which is nothing more than a camper shell on a
pickup.
</P>
<P>
   The rag-tag trailer park where the Munoz family has made its
home for the last 14 years is a symptom of a gradual but steady
decline in living conditions in the northeast San Fernando Valley
that has Los Angeles officials pondering what could be the largest
redevelopment project in the city's history.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of the northeast Valley, redevelopment experts say,
are part of a relatively new phenomenon that other communities will
face in coming decades: suburban blight, the aging of neighborhoods
outside the traditional urban core.
</P>
<P>
   While the roots of the decline _ poverty, a lack of political
clout, the departure of the middle class _ may be the same as those
found in urban centers, they present new challenges, experts say.
Rather than being concentrated in well-defined areas, much of the
worst blight in areas like the northeast Valley is tucked away in
small pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is largely a function of land use and scale,''
said Robert Fazio, a longtime employee of the city's Community
Redevelopment Agency and a coordinator of the San Fernando Valley
project. ``We don't have the density of New York and Philadelphia,
but there still is great economic disparity of income and education
levels and employment opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   While blight exists, he said, ``some conditions are so subtle
but so pervasive that it's going to be tough to make clearly
defined visible improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, the redevelopment project would include 6,835 acres and
take at least 20 years, with the possibility of being extended
another 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Redevelopment officials, who devised the plan at the request of
the City Council, are proposing that about $490 million in property
taxes be diverted to the area over the next four decades to upgrade
land, provide new housing and stimulate business and industry that
will generate jobs. Only a broad outline has been sketched.
</P>
<P>
   Early plans include basic community improvements, like a
$100,000 tree planting initiative, the development of a
community-based art plan and improvement of employment, education
and transit services.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is subject to the approval of the City Council,
which is scheduled to consider it this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The area's decline is rooted in how it grew up, said James P.
Allen, a professor of geography at California State University at
Northridge and an expert on the ethnic population of Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   The northeast Valley is a sprawling network of older settlements
and the remnants of farming communities like Pacoima in the
northeast reaches of Los Angeles. It has long been home to new
immigrants, particularly Mexicans, who often find it difficult to
break the cycle of poverty. Many of those whose skills and incomes
improve move on to the more prosperous communities to the west.
</P>
<P>
   Those left behind traditionally had little political clout.
</P>
<P>
   The northeast Valley developed helter-skelter. Residential areas
often crouch next to industrial sites. Trailer parks have sprouted
beside gravel pits. Small motels along Route 99 now house large
families in single rooms. The shopping areas scattered about the
northeast Valley are heavy on liquor stores and lack the kinds of
services that families need.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are little things that make you see the difference,''
said Neal S. Dudovitz, executive director of San Fernando Valley
Neighborhood Legal Services, in the heart of the Pacoima business
district. ``All the banks have left; there's one bank for about
80,000 people. Until recently, there was no bank machine.''
</P>
<P>
   According to reports prepared for the Community Redevelopment
Agency, property values in the area declined by 10 percent from
1994 to 1998, compared with less than one-third of a percent in
that period in Los Angeles County. The average household size, a
figure used to measure overcrowding, was 3.4 for the area, compared
with 2.97 citywide. In some pockets, the average household size was
as high as six. Per capita income was $9,266, compared with $16,188
citywide.
</P>
<P>
   The full picture, however, is less visible. Fazio tells of 10
people living in an old Airstream trailer, paying $100 a month for
the right. In old motels, families double up in one-room lodging.
</P>
<P>
   To address housing issues, the plan calls for rehabilitating
existing property, selling blighted property and developing new
homes. It also proposes improvements, like new sidewalks, street
paving and new street lights.
</P>
<P>
   Low-interest loans are to be offered to encourage business
expansion and modernization. In commercial areas, building facades
would be renovated, along with general improvements like lighting,
security and parking.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the project say the redevelopment agency has an
unimpressive record in tackling other projects in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not opposed to revitalization,'' said Don Lippman, who
does not live in the area but criticizes the agency's work in
general. ``I'm not opposed to jobs. I'm not opposed to reinvestment
or improving people lives. I'm not opposed to redevelopment. I'm
opposed to the C.R.A because they don't do the job. All they do is
take the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Redevelopment officials counter by naming more than a half-dozen
sites where their efforts have resulted in improvements, including
Watts, where an agency project brought more housing and a shopping
center.
</P>
<P>
   Still some people in the northeast Valley are apprehensive. Dick
Symonds, who owns a business in the area and recently won a seat on
the project's community oversight committee, said he was ``trying
to learn what they are going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All I've been able to establish so far is what they can do:
take your land, make you fix up your land,'' Symonds said.
</P>
<P>
   Fazio said no changes would be made without the participation
and support of people in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Caron Caines, a legal aid lawyer who has worked on the community
advisory panel, said the legal aid office had opposed some of the
practices of the agency on the ground that it had targeted
low-income communities ``because it's easier to bulldoze them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think there's a danger of that,'' Ms. Caines said,
adding that she had grown to believe that the agency could play a
useful role in redeveloping the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just concerned that it be used as a scalpel and not a
hacksaw,'' she said. ``I've worked with them now for years; they're
good people that care about the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Munoz, who moved to California from Guadalajara and is now a
legal resident, had not heard about the proposed development.
</P>
<P>
   Still, standing outside his home, an American flag hanging by
his door near a small pedal car secured by a chain, he was
intrigued by the idea of neighborhood improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more space,'' said Munoz, who pays $343 a month rent
to stay in the trailer park bordering a recycling plant. ``A clean
yard where the kids can play and not get sick would be good.''

ANALYSIS: ON BANDWAGON, WORRY ABOUT EARLY BOARDING 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The way some Republicans tell it, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas had the best night of his campaign on Tuesday when he
lost the New Hampshire primary by 19 points to Sen John McCain of
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Mahe, a veteran political consultant, said that without
the toughening that comes from a stiff primary challenge, Bush
``would not have been prepared to take on Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Bush's allies concede, another great night like Tuesday
could be fatal. ``There is certainly not panic'' now, said one
Washington lobbyist. ``That would occur the day after South
Carolina if there was a big problem there.''
</P>
<P>
   What is really going on within the Republican establishment is
concern that the candidate most Republicans bought into very early
may have a political glass jaw. Or, as one Republican senator said
Friday of some of his colleagues, ``They are worried sick that
McCain might possibly pull that off.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no mileage in admitting to being worried yourself,
even anonymously. After all, why follow a potentially premature
endorsement with a premature panic when Bush might win from here on
out?
</P>
<P>
   Hence, the combination of criticism of Bush's staff _ a
conventional politician's response that treats choosing aides as no
more the candidate's responsibility than the weather _ and the hope
that they, and he, will soon do better.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Budget Committee
and a presidential campaign dropout, made both points. ``I think
McCain will be good for Bush, just the way Bradley was good for
Gore. McCain will cause him to focus and fight more, and his staff
will have to take another look at his schedule and how they present
his message.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes there comes assertions of utter confidence in
Bush's success, though some of these sound canned, as if they came
from talking points produced by his campaign. Consider Gov. Tom
Ridge of Pennsylvania, who said in a statement, ``Now the nation
will see what I've known for years. George W. Bush is a competitor,
a fighter who doesn't flinch at adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, in a less formal tone, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who said
Bush only lost in New Hampshire because it was an odd place: ``No
Texan has ever really done well in New Hampshire. These are people
who expect candidates to grovel. Texans have many skills. Groveling
is not one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   There is more to politicians' hopes for Bush than the desire not
to let their support for him look foolish.
</P>
<P>
   There is some intense hostility toward McCain. Some of it is
personal. Quite a few senators do not like him and feel his attacks
on the campaign finance system imply they are corrupt while he
remains pure despite raking in donations as chairman of the
Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the hostility relates to abortion. Douglas Johnson,
legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee, said
his group was worried that McCain might be nominated and for that
reason was running radio ads attacking him in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   One is titled ``If this is South Carolina, I must be pro-life,''
and asserts McCain takes a different stance on abortion in
California from his position in South Carolina. It also attacks his
campaign finance legislation, arguing it would hamper the
committee's ability to run ads like that one.
</P>
<P>
   A third reason for their hostility is his opposition to the use
of ``soft money,'' the large, unregulated contributions from
corporations, unions and rich people that have become a staple of
presidential campaigns. The lobbyist asked, ``How could we spend
soft money if he was opposed?'' And, since soft money is a major
assumption for the Bush fall campaign, he said, ``We've spent a
year as a party essentially planning a national campaign around a
Bush candidacy. All the cards would have to be reshuffled'' if
McCain won.
</P>
<P>
   There are some establishment Republicans who have no serious
problems with McCain. Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi, a Bush
backer but a McCain friend, said, ``John is a legitimate
candidate.'' He said the contest ``will strengthen the party in the
long run.''
</P>
<P>
   A trade association chief said of Bush, ``I'm starting to think
he may have a glass jaw,'' and a fight with McCain would either
prove it, or toughen him up to compete with Gore. He said McCain
would get Republican support if he won.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, who said he was ``absolutely confident'' that Bush would
be nominated, said McCain was a perfectly acceptable alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one reason for the blandness of what Republicans are
willing to say for attribution is a concern over annoying whoever
turns out to be the party's standard-bearer.
</P>
<P>
   So they are reduced to offering campaign advice for Bush. Mahe
said Bush's aides had to let him be less scripted so the public
would see him ``reacting with his own thoughts and relying less on
other people's thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   Haley Barbour, a former Republican National Committee chairman,
said: ``Bush got his clock cleaned in New Hampshire. People like to
see how a front-runner reacts when he's chopped down to size.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect Bush to be very visible and accessible and his
appearances less structured,'' Barbour said. ``That allows people
to see how comfortable he is with himself.''

NETS WILT UNDER PRESSURE ONCE AGAIN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Kendall Gill had chastised his teammates for two days,
trying desperately to spark a positive response. He said that some
of the New Jersey Nets lacked a killer instinct, that too many of
them crumbled when met with tension.
</P>
<P>
   For much of Friday night's game against the Boston Celtics, it
looked as if the Nets had taken heed of their co-captain's words.
But the real test did not come until the final minutes, until the
Nets were face to face with the bully that had beaten them in eight
of their last 10 games: late-game pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The test would have had to wait another day had the Nets been
strong enough to maintain the 17-point lead they had with less than
a minute left in the third quarter. But the Nets crashed harder
than ever in the fourth quarter, being outscored by 30-13 and
losing, 100-95, before 16,540 fans at the Fleet Center.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, which handed the Nets their sixth straight defeat, won
as in the fourth quarter Tony Battie seemed to grab every rebound
and Antoine Walker and Paul Pierce seemed to get to every loose
ball.
</P>
<P>
   With 1 minute 50 seconds left, the score was tied at 92-92, but
Adrian Griffin drove through the Nets' defense to put the Celtics
ahead by 2. Scott Burrell answered with a 3-pointer with 1:13
remaining, but it was the Nets' last lead. Kenny Anderson scored
with 47 seconds to play to put Boston up by 96-95, and then Keith
Van Horn forced a shot in the lane that missed.
</P>
<P>
   Jim McIlvaine rebounded but missed his put-back, and Pierce
grabbed the rebound. The Nets sent Anderson to the foul line, where
he made two free throws to push the lead to 98-95 with 17 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   With one last chance, the Nets called a timeout and set up for
an inbounds play. Burrell got the ball to Gill _ after the Nets
were forced to call two timeouts _ but the Nets could not get it in
Stephon Marbury's hands. So Burrell was forced to shoot a contested
3-pointer that missed. Pierce grabbed the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Two free throws later, it was official. The Nets had lost yet
another game in the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury had 20 points and 11 assists, and Van Horn, who grabbed
11 rebounds, struggled to score 10 points on 3-of-11 shooting.
Pierce led five Celtics in double figures with 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   A key to the Nets' success over the first three quarters was
their tremendous defensive play against Walker. The 6-foot-9-inch
forward has devastated the Nets for two years, averaging 27 points
in his previous five outings against New Jersey. In two previous
meetings this season, he averaged 32 points a game, including a
39-point, 11-rebound performance in the Celtics' 99-96 victory in
the Meadowlands on Jan. 15.
</P>
<P>
   That effort set Walker on a tear that had been unstoppable.
Including that game, he had averaged 26.1 points and 7.9 rebounds
in his last 10 contests before Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Walker's exploits versus the Nets forced them to double-team him
early, and it worked with unforeseen success. Walker, with two men
in his face as soon as he touched the ball, had just six points on
2-of-6 shooting through three quarters. But when winning time came,
Walker became the force the Nets feared.
</P>
<P>
   Before Walker took the game into his hands, his teammates put
Boston in position. With their full-court pressure shaking the
Nets, the Celtics went on a game-turning 11-0 run that began in the
final minute of the third quarter. Down by 82-65 with 47 seconds
left in the period, Boston soon moved within 82-76 with 9:55 to
play.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who had been on the bench for several minutes,
re-entered with eight minutes left and made his presence felt,
scoring points points to pull the Celtics within 84-80. Still being
double-teamed, Walker began beating the Nets with his penetration
and passing. He fed Dana Barros for a 3-pointer that cut the Nets'
lead to 86-84, then drove and dished to Battie for a game-tying
basket. From that point on, the Celtics' superior will and effort
were too much for the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   After a poor first quarter in which they trailed by as many as
12 points, the Nets took control in the second, outscoring the
Celtics by 32-16 to turn a seven-point deficit into a nine-point
lead at halftime. Surprisingly, it was the Nets' bench that sparked
the surge.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn, who had six points, five rebounds and a blocked shot
in the first 13 minutes, went to the bench one minute into the
second quarter with the Nets trailing by 34-27. Two minutes later,
with Boston ahead by four points, Elliot Perry substituted for
Marbury.
</P>
<P>
   With the Nets' two stars on the bench, Johnny Newman, who
finished with 15 points, took over the spotlight, ignoring the wear
and tear on his 36-year-old body and going back in time. Scoring
from inside and outside, on drives, jump shots and from the foul
line, Newman poured in 12 straight Nets points, outscoring Boston
by six by himself.
</P>
<P>
   The run brought the Nets within 42-41, and when Perry buried a
17-foot shot with 4:08 remaining in the half, they took their first
lead of the game.

   TOBACCO ALLY TARGETS McCAIN IN AD CAMPAIGN  
 (bl)  
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Smokers Alliance, a group subsidized by the tobacco
industry, has begun running a 30-second advertisement in South
Carolina that sharply attacks Sen. John McCain of Arizona for his
sponsorship of an anti-smoking bill to impose fees on tobacco that
would have raised the price of a pack of cigarettes by $1.10. South
Carolina holds its presidential primary Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER National Smokers Alliance
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: Two black-and-white photographs of McCain,
smiling in one and scowling in the other, materialize as the
voice-over labels him a ``typical Washington politician.'' The
narrator accuses McCain of having proposed ``the largest consumer
tax increase in history'' while claiming in his campaign for
president that he has ``never voted for a tax increase.'' Headlines
appear on the screen from articles by United Press International
(``McCain vows tobacco taxes, regulation'') and The San Diego
Union-Tribune (``Tobacco politics: tax and spend, not smoking,
defined McCain's bill''). They are followed by an effect in which
the two photographs merge into one, intended to suggest political
duplicity.
</P>
<P>
   SCRIPT: Narrator: ``John McCain, presidential candidate, meet
Senator John McCain, typical Washington politician. Candidate
McCain states that as senator he has never voted for a tax
increase. Yet in 1998, Senator McCain sponsored legislation backed
by President Clinton to increase tobacco taxes. Senator McCain's
bill would have imposed the largest consumer tax increase in
history: $516 billion. Saying one thing and doing another. That's
the real John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: McCain was in fact chief architect of legislation
intended to discourage smoking among young people. In June 1998 the
bill died on the Senate floor because backers could not muster the
60 votes they needed on procedural issues. In addition to the fees,
the bill would have imposed monetary penalties on cigarette makers
if the number of young smokers did not decline to designated
levels. McCain and the White House, which supported the measure,
estimated the 25-year cost of the bill at $516 billion. The senator
has, indeed, asserted that he has never voted to raise taxes, and
some supporters of the bill said the fees did not constitute a tax.
Still, a levy imposed on a commodity like cigarettes, sometimes
referred to as a ``sin tax,'' is intended less as a means of
filling government coffers than as a way of enforcing a social
mandate.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: A classic attack advertisement tailored to the
perceived economic insecurities of a tobacco state. The
advertisement also tries to portray McCain as an inside-the-Beltway
ally of Clinton, who is not popular in South Carolina Republican
politics. The National Smokers Alliance, which is based in
Alexandria, Va., and claims a membership of three million, clashed
with McCain over the 1998 bill; the group, financed in part by
Philip Morris Cos. and Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., ran
advertisements at the time attacking McCain. He proved somewhat
impervious to cries of hypocrisy on tax issues from advertisements
sponsored by interest groups in New Hampshire, and whether the
approach has more traction when tied to a home-grown industry like
tobacco remains to be seen. &QL;

IN NEW YORK, TENSION RISES BETWEEN TOP TWO IN GOP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The tension between the state government's two
top Republicans has escalated to the point that several Republican
senators said this week that Gov. George Pataki may be plotting to
oust the Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's aides vehemently deny that they or the governor are
considering such a move, and there is no hard evidence that they
have made any effort to topple Bruno. ``That is so preposterous I'm
not even going to dignify it with a comment,'' said Zenia Mucha,
the governor's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that talk of a coup has gained currency here is a
sign of how the relationship between the governor and the Senate
leader, a tight partnership for most of the five years they have
held their posts, has deteriorated, most recently in a squabble
over health care spending.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that Bruno remains firmly in control of the Senate,
with his fellow Republicans mostly expressing anger at the
governor's handling of the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the governor called several Republican senators into
his office, one at a time, for discussions of the growing
confrontation, and some of the senators took those meetings as a
sign that Pataki was looking for cracks in Bruno's support. ``When
the governor says, `How are you with Joe?' I think that's obviously
what's going on,'' said one senator who met with the governor, and
who, like nearly all those interviewed, insisted that his name not
be used for fear of incurring the wrath of the governor.
</P>
<P>
   A Pataki aide gave a radically different interpretation of those
meetings, saying that some of the senators told the governor that
if they were forced to choose, they would stand by Bruno _
evidence, the aide said, of mounting paranoia among the Senate's
Republican majority. The aide said Pataki and his staff made it
clear to the senators that no one was asking them to take sides or
move against Bruno.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Pataki and Bruno had what aides to both described
as a heated conversation, in which each cited a long list of
grievances, some dating back years.
</P>
<P>
   The issue that ignited the confrontation had to do with the
financing of a new health care plan for the poor, approved in
December by Pataki and the Legislature, but with roots stretching
back much further.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several months, Bruno has angered Pataki and his
aides by staking out a series of positions without the governor's
approval. In some cases, they were positions Pataki opposed
outright.
</P>
<P>
   Senators and Senate aides argue that they have a right to set
their own agenda, and that the Senate's proposals have been nothing
more or less than smart politics in an election year in which the
Republicans are keen to hold on to their 36-25 majority over the
Democrats in the Senate. And they worry that a feud between the
Senate and the governor's office could hurt their chances in
November.
</P>
<P>
   But in the governor's office, the Senate proposals have been
seen as stretching independence to the point of disloyalty. Aides
to Pataki have also accused Bruno and his aides _ sometimes
erroneously _ of leaking too much information about Capitol
deal-making to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bruno took the position that the health care deal
negotiated by the governor should be altered so that the state,
which is running a large surplus, would absorb the entire cost,
rather than passing on $340 million a year in expenses to New York
City and the counties. For Republican senators who were hearing
sharp complaints from local governments about the new mandates, it
seemed like nothing more than good government and smart politics.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor's office apparently viewed the senator's
statements as a direct challenge to Pataki. Last weekend, a handful
of state officials who got their jobs through ties to Bruno were
fired. The administration denied that the dismissals were
retaliatory, a denial viewed in the Legislature as laughable. Since
then, there have been rampant rumors of another round of firings,
while Bruno has threatened to stall Senate confirmation of some
gubernatorial appointees.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Aides to Pataki charge that two Bruno aides have created the
atmosphere of mistrust. And they insist that rumors of a plan to
overthrow Bruno can be traced to senators who would like to take
his place.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans, in turn, blame much of the tension on Pataki
aides, including Mucha and Brad Race, the governor's chief of
staff, whom they accuse of being high-handed in their treatment of
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Those in Bruno's camp say he has been a good ally to the
governor for five years, but that Pataki has not returned the
favor. They recall that the governor, taking Bruno's side and
calling for an end to rent controls in 1997, pulled back when the
fight got heated, forcing the Senate leader to give in. They
contend that the governor's office has misled them several times on
revenue projections to keep state spending down, and some are still
irked by Pataki's budget vetoes in 1998.

A FORCE OF ONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA, Calif. _ Sometimes John Force feels like one of those
gunslingers from the Old West.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Wyatt Earp or Doc Holliday had to withstand challenges
from every young gun that rode into town, so too has the Bell
Gardens native, who has won seven consecutive National Hot Rod
Association Funny Car championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's owned the town,'' said Whit Bazemore, who has finished
in the top five in points in each of the past three seasons. ``He's
the gunfighter standing out in the middle of the street shooting
every new guy that comes by. But one of these days, somebody is
going to get him. One of these days ...''
</P>
<P>
   And that could be this year ... at least his competitors are
making every effort to wrestle away a title Force has won nine of
the past 10 years. This season, which begins with this weekend's
Winternationals, has seen no fewer then five teams making
significant changes to their operations.
</P>
<P>
   And all with one thought in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said it before, we're not out here to go for No. 2,''
said Jerry Toliver, who defeated Force in a thrilling tire-smoking
final at last season's NHRA Finals in November. ''We're here to win
this thing. If I didn't think we could win, I wouldn't try. I don't
want to be an also-ran. It's not my goal to qualify, or make the
top 10. I want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   And Toliver has made several changes to achieve that aspiration.
He added a second car late last season, then signed veteran crew
chief Dale Armstrong _ who tuned Kenny Bernstein to four Funny Car
titles in the 1980s and the Top Fuel championship in 1996 _ in the
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dale is as good or better then any crew chief in the
business,'' Toliver said. ``When I heard he was available, it was
like hearing Albert Einstein was walking around unemployed.''
</P>
<P>
   Toliver is not the only one gearing up for a run at the champ.
</P>
<P>
   Bazemore, in his second year driving for former Funny Car pilot
Chuck Etchells, has added Matco Tools as a associate major sponsor.
Other moves include Alan Johnson adding a Funny Car team to his
championship-caliber Top Fuel program and Del Worsham fielding a
second team with three-time winner Frank Pedregon as driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have tabbed us to be the guy that knocks Force off,''
Bazemore said. ``To be honest, there are a lot of good teams that
are going to run well. (Ron Capps) ran well in testing. We ran
well. Bruce Sarver and Toliver, those are good teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of cars who are capable. It's just not
Force.''
</P>
<P>
   Which might be the key to ending Force's decade-long dominance
that has seen him win 76 national events since 1990, including 11
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't have John run away like he did last year,'' Bazemore
said. ``For us to beat John the whole class must be strong. What
hurt us last year was having a guy like Capps struggle like he did.
That was just another guy who couldn't beat John.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows that better then Force, who all but wrapped up the
title before June by winning six of the first eight events.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more cars that are better now,'' admits Force.
``It's like catching the bouquet in a wedding ceremony. If there
are three people out there, your chances are pretty good. But get
200 out there, then what are your odds?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a tough year. There are so many people who
can knock you down (the eliminations) ladder, then they get you in
the second round. That's another race you could lose, and you only
have to lose a few of those, and then you don't have a title.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Force hasn't stood still. He's expanded his empire,
adding goracing.com as an associate sponsor to his already strong
Team Castrol operation, and hired aerodynamic specialist Tim
Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is setting sail and is going after John,'' said
Pedregon, brother of Force teammate Tony Pedregon. ``John is
hearing footsteps, but John is still the king. He's a lot like
Muhammad Ali. The more guys that are targeting him, the more he
gets stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   But is he beatable?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already beaten John,'' Toliver said. ``I think this team
is capable of beating John Force every time we face him. We've
already done it, now we have a better team.''
</P>
<P>
   And so does everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't assume John is going to dominate again,'' Bazemore
said. ``But you can't say he is going to be weak either. You just
can't predict that stuff. It's going to be hard to win it. We just
have to go out and try to win races, win rounds and qualify well.
If we do that, then at the end of the year, we'll see where we
are.''

GROUP FINDS HEALTH CARE IN NEW YORK STATE PRISONS INCONSISTENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By NINA SIEGAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Medical care for New York state prison inmates varies
greatly because of inadequate external oversight and a shortage of
qualified doctors in the prisons, according to a study made public
this week by a watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the Correctional Association of New York
recommended that Gov. George Pataki and the legislature appoint a
committee _ including senior officials of the State Department of
Health _ to monitor prison health care.
</P>
<P>
   State prison officials criticized the report, calling it
inaccurate and misleading. James B. Flateau, a spokesman for the
State Department of Correction, said it was worthless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no intention of changing anything or implementing any
of the recommendations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Kenny, a spokesman for the State Health Department, said he
had not received the report, but added, ``We are confident the
state prison system is providing quality health care to inmates.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, financed by grants from three private foundations
based in New York, was conducted over 18 months by a team of about
a dozen researchers, including some prisoners' advocates,
physicians and interested citizens. The group visited 22 state
prisons, interviewing 1,300 inmates and 100 medical personnel
members.
</P>
<P>
   The authors found that despite recent advances in the treatment
of HIV, AIDS and tuberculosis behind bars, there are still many
areas of health care that deserve more consistent attention.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer R. Wynn, the principal author of the report, said one
of the most troubling discoveries was a shortage of board-certified
physicians treating inmates. Under state law, prison doctors do not
need board certification, and the C A recommended that the state
change that policy.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gangi, executive director of the CA, said, ``We got the
impression that the prison system was the employer of last resort
for that doctor, and as a result health care in those facilities is
compromised.''
</P>
<P>
   Flateau, the correction department spokesman, said board
certification was not necessary. ``Doctors who treat our inmates
are the same doctors that treat people in communities all across
upstate New York,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998-99 fiscal year, the department spent $175 million on
health care in 70 state prisons, serving 71,000 inmates, said
Flateau, adding that the state's prison health care funding has
resulted in lower AIDS death rates and increased salaries for
medical personnel.

SMALLER LOSSES? IT'S NOT TRIUMPH 
</HEADLINE>
 COL.-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The wacky world of Internet investing got wackier this week when
e-tailer extraordinaire Amazon.com reported a 1999 fourth-quarter
net loss of $323 million.
</P>
<P>
   This was about six times bigger than its 1998 fourth-quarter
loss, but was accompanied by a tripling of fourth-quarter revenue
over '98, to $676 million. Although Amazon hasn't reported a profit
since going public in 1997, company execs spun their story with
forecasts of smaller losses in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   This was all Wall Street needed to hear. The stock price soared
almost $9 in after-hours trading Wednesday, and added nearly $15
more Thursday to close at $84 and change.
</P>
<P>
   Don't stop me if you've heard this one: Two guys go into the
widget business. After a year, they're barely breaking even despite
good sales. One partner's suggested solution is lowering prices to
spur sales. No, the other objects, if we sell our widgets for less
than it costs to make them, we'll lose money. Don't worry, his
partner says, we'll make it up on volume.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a simpler time, this business joke was a real
knee-slapper. Now, in a more sophisticated time, it's apparently a
business plan taken seriously by Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Has anyone pondered the implications of the revenue-loss
numbers? Amazon in the fourth quarter lost almost 50 cents for
every dollar of revenue it took in. This is a real-life variation
of the hoary joke about seeking to overcome business losses by
selling more product at a money-losing price.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. Amazon is a joy to do business with. After
ordering books from Amazon twice, my impression is that it does
what it does better than anyone else in the same business, bar
none.
</P>
<P>
   Being good, however, isn't the same as making money, which is
the raison d'etre for being in business and for investing in a
business. Amazon may be legitimately viewed as a company with much
promise, but certainly nothing to bet the ranch on. Bidding up its
stock 20 percent on expectations of smaller losses isn't a rational
act.
</P>
<P>
   The stock traded upwards of 44 million shares Thursday, which
seems a convincing sign of significant institutional interest. If
so, the Amazon craze isn't a case of Little Guys having a
speculative flip-out at the top. What's happening implies some of
the smartest money managers in the game plunging money into a
life-imitating-art situation that once provided the basis for the
old ``make it up on volume'' joke.
</P>
<P>
   Another red flag apparently lost on Wall Street is a possible
regulatory spot of bother that could make Amazon's financials less
attractive. The Securities and Exchange Commission, says an Amazon
exec, is reviewing how e-commerce businesses account for the cost
of shipping orders. Amazon and those similarly situated have been
treating such costs as marketing expenses.
</P>
<P>
   There's a possibility, though, the SEC may force e-tailers to
account for them as operating costs. This would shrink gross
margins, which is the revenue left after subtracting the cost of
sales. Amazon says the company is ``indifferent'' to this
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? The way things are going, this sort of problem might
even enhance Amazon's perceived value on Wall Street.

COMMENTARY: (AT) WITS' END, ENVIOUS AND IN A MOOD TO TAUNT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What do you call a dot-com lout? Readers happily
responded to last week's call for an updated version of Eurotrash
that would apply to today's rich invaders. Unfortunately, the most
popular one is not printable, but there are alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 readers nominated words like technotrash,
dot-compost, e-coli, cyberscum, barbarians at the portal, World
Wide Weasels, dolt-coms, netjerks, compucreeps, Intergnats,
e-rrivistes, virtual vulgarians, RAMbos, couthless from Seattle,
nattering nabobs of netativity _ and those are just a few that
didn't make the final round.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the entries were accompanied by tirades against today's
cybersnappers, also referred to as Webrats. Oddly, almost no one
complained.
</P>
<P>
   I was prepared to placate the many polite dot-commies by
assuring them that New York welcomes their money and energy, and
that this juvenile exercise in name-calling is just a way of
defusing resentment at the rude minority.
</P>
<P>
   But even the cyberjerks themselves seemed pleased to be reviled.
A self-described ``callow 29-year-old'' wrote a letter excoriating
his elders that began ``John, dude'' and ended, ``I bet the
Neanderthal on seeing the approach of Homo sapiens thought they
were pretty damned rude. Tough.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of charm explains why so many contestants drew
inspiration from snot-nosed children. Snot-com was one of the
finalists. It was judged a good word for an upstart company, but
not for the people in it.
</P>
<P>
   Another finalist, netwit, was also judged to be a specialized
term: someone on the Internet who thinks he's funny and is not.
E-jerk seemed best to describe a way of not getting along with
others: an e-jerk reaction.
</P>
<P>
   The winner was another e-word popular both among contestants (it
was nominated by two dozen of them) and the judges. It was a hit in
the first focus-group test, which was conducted even before the
contest began last week.
</P>
<P>
   Several participants subsequently introduced this term at their
offices, and it quickly entered common usage.
</P>
<P>
   Marisa Bowe, a contestant from Silicon Alley (her entries
included Alley Trash), has posted the winning word at the online
magazine she edits, Word (www.word.com/cyberinsults).
</P>
<P>
   The winning word cannot be printed here. It isn't explicitly
vulgar, but it alludes to a crude anatomical term. (So does another
popular entry, a variant beginning with (at), that was proposed to
define a person who sends rude or unwanted e-mail.)
</P>
<P>
   But there are two printable runner-ups. One of them is cyboor, a
contraction of cyberboor and a play off cyborg. Cyborgs (short for
cybernetic organisms) are part-human and part-robot, a condition
that sometimes seems evident in cyboors, too. But cyboors generally
lack the good qualities of robots. The official definition:
</P>
<P>
   Cyboor n. A rude, stupid or arrogant person seeking to profit
from commerce on the Internet, esp. one regarded as undeserving of
wealth or esteem.
</P>
<P>
   It's a broad term that can apply to just about all louts in the
dot-com industry, including ones who haven't yet gotten rich. The
other runner-up word is more specific:
</P>
<P>
   I.P.Oaf n. A foolish or graceless person who has been suddenly
enriched by the initial public offering (IPO) of company securities
to investors; a member of the Internet nouveau riche, a parvenu
faulted for conspicuous consumption, poor taste or overbearing
manners.
</P>
<P>
   Philosophers might wonder which came first, the IPO or the oaf.
Some people were oafish long before they made any money; some were
turned into oafs by the sudden wealth. Either way, they're
I.P.Oafs.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that their oafishness only becomes obvious after a
sudden change in their social station. In that sense, the term
recalls the original meaning of oaf: a child of a goblin or elf
(oaf comes from the Old Norse word for elf) who is switched with a
human child, leaving the human parents appalled at the misshapen
changeling.
</P>
<P>
   If you are similarly appalled to see I.P.Oafs ensconced at the
top of the social and economic ladders, now you can at least
console yourself with name-calling. But if you are consumed with
envy, you will not be satisfied until the Internet bubble bursts
and you get a chance to call them by yet another entry in the
contest:
</P>
<P>
   Dot-commoner n. A former I.P.Oaf impoverished by a decline in
the stock market; an unemployed cyberboor (see cyberpoor,
networthless).

SPAIN'S TELEFONICA MOVES TO BUY OUT LATIN AMERICA AFFILIATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By AL GOODMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ Shareholders of Telefonica, Spain's largest
telephone company, approved a 28 percent capital increase Friday
worth 26.6 billion euros, or about $26.1 billion, for a buyout of
four affiliates in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of the expansion effort coincided with news that two
top executives had abruptly stepped down, the latest in a number of
management shake-ups at the company in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent executive to leave was Juan Perea, 36, the
chief executive of Telefonica's Internet unit, Terra Networks SA.
It is Europe's largest publicly traded Internet company and has
nearly tripled in value since its stock market debut last November.
</P>
<P>
   Abel Linares Palacios, chief executive of Telefonica's Yellow
Pages unit, Telefonica Publicidad e Informacion SA, will leave that
position to run Terra.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed all-stock buyout of four big phone companies that
Telefonica already controls in Brazil, Argentina and Peru was
announced last month, but the special meeting of shareholders
Friday gave the approval to issue the 922 million new shares needed
to complete the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Telefonica aims to consolidate its position as the leading
communications company in Latin America and will offer to buy out
shareholders in Telefonica de Argentina SA, Telefonica del Peru SA
and two Brazilian companies, Telesp Participacoes SA, a fixed-line
company in Sao Paulo, and Telesudeste Celular Participacoes SA, a
wireless operator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a historic operation for Telefonica that will permit the
consolidation of its leadership with confidence,'' said Juan
Villalonga, the chairman of Telefonica.
</P>
<P>
   Abrupt executive departures have become part of the legacy of
Villalonga, who has restructured Telefonica twice since he was
appointed to run the company in 1996, a year before it was
privatized. Many executives who were originally part of his
management team have left.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said that Villalonga had forced out his one-time
ally, Perea, and a Telefonica director general, Jose Antonio
Sanchez, in a dispute over company strategy.

   UNION HELP FOR DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
   The New York State AFL-CIO said Friday that it would have
thousands of union members distribute 1 million fliers supporting
Vice President Al Gore at 10,000 workplaces from Long Island to
Buffalo on Monday. Calling the move the largest one-day political
action ever undertaken by organized labor in New York, Denis
Hughes, president of the state labor federation, said the
leafleting showed that labor would be a major force in the state's
March 7 Democratic primary. The fliers praise Gore's record on
education and health care and his support of the right to organize
a union.
</P>
<P>
   KEYES ON THE ROAD
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes pressed his campaign for the Republican presidential
nomination today in South Carolina, where he spoke at the City Club

   McCAIN AND CROSSING OVER

   Sen. John McCain's campaign committee in Washington state is
trying to capitalize on the state's open-primary laws. On Thursday
in Seattle it presented several independent and Democratic voters
who said they planned to cast their ballots for McCain in the
Republican primary. Campaign officials said they were finding
support among those voters. The state's primary is Feb. 29, and its
caucuses are March 7, with Republican delegates to be selected on
both days. The state has no party registration so any registered
voter may choose any candidate on the ballot.

EDWARD ZIGLER, KC NATIVE, WINS $250,000 HEINZ AWARD  
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE LINDNER  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY. Mo. _ Edward Zigler, a Kansas City native and one
of the creators of Head Start, was named this week as the winner of
the $250,000 Heinz Award in the area of public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Given by the Heinz Family Foundation, the awards each year
recognize outstanding lifetime contributions in the areas of public
policy; arts and humanities; technology, the economy and
employment; the environment; and the human condition.
</P>
<P>
   Zigler is a professor of psychology at Yale University and
director of the Yale Bush Center in Child Development and Social
Policy. He has studied childhood development for 45 years, helping
shape government policy and programs for at-risk children.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I do....It's worth doing,'' said Zigler, 69.
``This isn't work; it's my life.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1964 he was on the White House committee that created Head
Start. He has remained involved in the program, at times
criticizing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children don't get as much attention in this country as I
would like them to get,'' he said Friday in a telephone interview
from New Haven, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   He decried that the nation was ``in the midst of this booming
economy, and we're serving only 40 percent of eligible children.''
</P>
<P>
   Head Start is a child development program that serves children
from birth to age 5, pregnant women and their families. Its goal is
to increase school-readiness in children from low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Polish immigrants, Zigler grew up in Kansas City with
his parents and three sisters. His sister, Maurine Agron of
Leawood, Kan., said they were privileged to be deprived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were never taught to feel that we needed, only that we
could help others,'' his sister said.
</P>
<P>
   Zigler attended Manual Training High School and the University
of Kansas City, now the University of Missouri-Kansas City. He
credited his teachers here for giving him the skills to be
successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in Kansas City was the basis for everything I've done in
my life,'' Zigler said.
</P>
<P>
   C.C. Fairchild was one of those teachers. A speech teacher at
Manual, Fairchild trained Zigler to be an oratorical champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believed in us,'' Zigler's sister said of Fairchild. ``And
dragged my brother to every speech and debate tournament in the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Henley, former superintendent of the Independence School
District, said Zigler's ideas had helped children all over the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't think of a more worthy recipient, for all the work
that he does,'' Henley said.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, Henley offered Independence as a test district
for Zigler's School of the 21st Century model. The two men came to
be friends over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The model involves using school buildings and staff to provide
day care to 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds and extending that care from
early morning until evening. It includes before- and after-school
supervision for children up to 12 years old and the Parents as
Teachers program.
</P>
<P>
   Zigler said some schools that used it had added a health-care
component. Independence has added Medicaid case management.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at Ed Zigler's model, he's worried about the total
development of children,'' Henley said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, Zigler said, the 21st Century model is used in about
700 schools, not counting those in Kentucky, which uses the program
statewide.
</P>
<P>
   It has been implemented in every Independence school and is
quite popular, Henley said.
</P>
<P>
   David Rock, the curtent superintendent of Independence, said:
``If we were to do away with the early childhood program, I'd be
run out of town.''
</P>
<P>
   Zigler has served as director of the Office of Child Development
_ now the Administration on Children, Youth and Families _ and as
chief of the U.S. Children's Bureau. He headed a national committee
whose work inspired the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about retirement, Zigler said an emphatic ``never.''
The author or editor of more than 30 books, Zigler regularly
appears as an expert witness before congressional committees.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's at heart a real Kansas City person,'' Henley said, ``a
real Kansas City success story.''

(Attn: Utah, Okla., Ind., Fla., Mich., Ohio, Wash., Mo., N.D. and
Tenn.) LEE HILLS, KNIGHT RIDDER OFFICIAL AND PULITZER WINNER, DIES By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lee Hills, who began a journalism career as a teen-age reporter
covering mining disasters in Utah, continued it as an editor by
bringing Pulitzer Prizes and national renown to The Miami Herald
and The Detroit Free Press, and finally spread the gospel of
quality journalism around the country as chief executive of the
Knight Ridder newspaper group, died Thursday in Miami. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   He earned a law degree by the age of 29 while moving through
newspapers in Oklahoma, Indiana, Ohio and Tennessee, and later
became well versed in the financial side of the business, but Hills
never strayed far from the newsroom.
</P>
<P>
   Even as editor of The Free Press, he could not resist the lure
of reporting _ a predilection that won him a Pulitzer Prize in 1955
for coverage of labor negotiations between the United Automobile
Workers and the automakers. He later revealed that no less a figure
than Henry Ford II had been a crucial source.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, as editor of The Miami Herald, he directed the
newspaper's coverage of mob bosses living in the area, a series
called ``Know Your Neighbor,'' which won that newspaper its first
Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, according to journalists who knew him, Hills saw
probing, objective journalism as a calling and a public service.
Hills _ an employee and friend of the late John S. Knight, who,
with his brother James, owned the Knight newspaper group _ had
sought to make the sharp, the curious, the critical and the
crusading professionals around him adopt his standards of fairness,
objectivity and excellence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew full well the kind of journalism he had come into, a
journalism of faction and interests and parochialism and
provincialism, and of a brawling independence as well,'' said
Hodding Carter, speaking of the 1920s and 1930s _ when Hills
covered everything from lynchings to the crime career of Charles
``Pretty Boy'' Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Carter continued, ``he believed so strongly in the
implications of a free press that he became one of the guys who
helped to guide us into the period in which the adoption of
standards and the notion of a semi-profession, with real connection
to principle, and with the idea that the news came first and public
interest came first.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who is president of the John S. and James L. Knight
Foundation, added: ``He came up wanting above all else to be a good
newspaperman, a good journalist. He became, in effect, the prime
minister for Jack Knight as he created a newspaper organization
that was solidly successful economically and held to the old values
in journalism throughout.''
</P>
<P>
   Hills was born in Egg Creek Township, near Granville, N.D., in
1906. The family moved to Utah after his mother's death in 1911. It
was in that state that he took his first job at a newspaper,
sweeping floors at The Price News Advocate.
</P>
<P>
   He received his college education at Brigham Young University
and the University of Missouri. While working as a reporter and
editorial writer at The Oklahoma City Times, which he joined in
1929, he earned a law degree. He later worked for that newspaper's
competitor, The Oklahoma News, a Scripps-Howard newspaper, before
introducing himself to John Knight in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   According to the obituary in The Detroit Free Press Friday,
Hills, looking for a new job, asked to meet with Knight, who, with
his brother, owned The Akron Beacon-Journal, The Detroit Free Press
and The Miami Herald. Knight agreed to take him on as a news editor
at The Herald. He soon became managing editor.
</P>
<P>
   When the government rationed newsprint at the height of the war,
Hills persuaded Knight to cut back on advertising to allow full
space for war coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the reporting he made room for was his own, as he served
briefly as a war correspondent for The Herald, and filed reports
from the Far East, the Middle East and Latin America _ an area of
the world that fascinated him. At The Herald, he supported
extensive coverage of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the head of professional groups, he found a way to get
back to his reporting roots. In 1962, touring the Soviet Union with
12 editors _ at the time he was president of the American Society
of Newspaper Editors _ he got nationwide attention, reporting an
interview with the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.
</P>
<P>
   As John Knight's chief lieutenant, Hills served for the better
part of three decades _ from 1951 to 1979 _ as executive editor or
publisher of both The Herald and The Free Press.
</P>
<P>
   Alvah Chapman, who, like Hills, served as a chief executive of
Knight Ridder, said Friday: ``Lee, of course, was both a business
operator and a journalist. He was responsible for the business
success as well as the editorial success of The Detroit Free Press.
But he was best known for editorial skills and news skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Hills and Chapman, at Knight's behest, arranged the 1974 merger
of Knight Newspapers Inc. with Ridder Publications Inc., producing
a newspaper group that boasted a greater circulation than any of
its rivals _ until the rapid growth of USA Today put the Gannett
Co. into the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hills was the first chairman and chief executive of the merged
newspaper group. He retired as editorial chairman in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Hills was also an active philanthropist in both Detroit and
Miami. Carter credits Hills with persuading the Knight brothers to
set up the Knight Foundation with gifts amounting to more than $400
million. He also served as president of the Inter-American Press
Association _ through which he met his third wife, Tina Ramos
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Hills is survived by his wife and by Ronald Hills of Saratoga,
Calif., his son with his first wife, Leona Hass, whom he divorced
in 1944. His second wife, Eileen Whitman Hills, whom he married in
1948, died in 1961. He is also survived by two sisters, Louise
Elwood, of Seattle, and BeverLee Margolis, of Mercer Island, Wash.;
a brother, Stanley Hills, of Mercer Island; two grandsons and three
great-grandsons.
</P>
<P>
   Al Neuharth, a colleague of Hills at The Herald and later, as
founder of USA Today, a competitor, said Friday: ``Among
journalists, he was a reporter who never stopped being a reporter,
even though he went on to be an executive and a publisher. But he
retained his reporter's instincts and sensibility, and that
motivated everything he did in his newspaper decisions.''

WASHINGTON POST'S WOODWARD RECEIVES AWARD AT KU  
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 ByDAWN BORMANN  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCE, Kan. _ Bob Woodward has done a lot of reporting and
book writing in the last quarter-century, but it's his work on the
Watergate scandal that still draws a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke Friday afternoon to about 575 people at the University
of Kansas. The crowd at the Woodruff Auditorium in the Kansas Union
ranged from retirees to college students.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Lloyd, 22, a senior majoring in political science, said he
attended because he wanted to see the ``the man who brought down
the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward and colleague Carl Bernstein uncovered the Watergate
scandal for The Washington Post. Their work led to the resignation
of President Richard M. Nixon and won the paper a Pulitzer Prize in
1973.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Woodward has written or co-written eight
best-selling nonfiction books, including All The President's Men
and The Final Days; Veil: The Secret Wars of the CIA; and Wired:
The Short Life and Fast Times of John Belushi. He now is an
assistant managing editor at The Post.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward spoke after receiving a national citation from the
William Allen White Foundation. The citation is presented annually
to a journalist with the ideals of White, a Kansas editor and
publisher who died in 1944. Previous winners include Walter
Cronkite, Helen Thomas, Ellen Goodman, Charles Kuralt, Robert
MacNeil and Jim Lehrer.
</P>
<P>
   KU Chancellor Robert Hemenway said later that Woodward was a
clear choice for the award.
</P>
<P>
   ``He clearly is one of the most distinguished journalists in the
world,'' Hemenway said. ``His work has had an impact far beyond the
borders of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward discussed the dynamics of present-day politics and
their connection to the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watergate was the background music to the whole Clinton
impeachment trial,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He called President Clinton a master at the art of
communication, saying that Ronald Reagan was ``an amateur compared
to Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Without predicting the next president, Woodward said the winner
would need to be trustworthy and have focus, discipline and
courage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The really great leaders,'' he said, ``are people who are
willing to walk the road alone for a while.''

NEW YORK POST AND DAILY NEWS SAY JOINT OPERATIONS ARE UNLIKELY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Post and The Daily News, whose rivalry
has generated flashes of rapier tabloid journalism and
multimillion-dollar losses, have held exploratory talks on
combining their printing and distribution operations to cut costs,
but the discussions have gone nowhere, officials of both papers
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, Ken Chandler, publisher and editor in chief of
The Post, and Mortimer B. Zuckerman, chairman and co-publisher of
The Daily News, confirmed a Wall Street Journal report Friday that
talks had been held, but both suggested that the discussions had
been dormant for months and might even be dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always listen to new ideas that are put before us,''
Chandler said. ``Some preliminary meetings were held. But we are
proceeding with our business plans with or without outside
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Zuckerman sounded even less sanguine. ``There were talks in the
most limited sense, but they never went beyond the exploratory
stage,'' he said. ``We never got into specific discussions, and
they're unlikely to be revived.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men were reluctant to discuss the substance of the talks,
except to acknowledge that a merging of printing and distribution
operations had been among the topics. There were apparently several
sessions over a year, ending about six months ago. It was unclear
why the talks were suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions took place against the backdrop of New York
City's highly competitive market for newspaper readers and
advertisers, in which The Post and The News, two of the nation's
largest tabloids, have struggled to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Both tabloids are privately held and do not disclose finances.
But The Post, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., is believed by
newspaper analysts to lose $9 million to $15 million a year, and
The Daily News recently disclosed in court documents that it lost
$17.9 million in 1998, despite a cash infusion of $19 million by
Zuckerman.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on the deep pockets of their owners, the tabloids have
each invested heavily in new color presses _ a $200 million plant
in the Bronx for The Post and a $62 million plant in Jersey City,
N.J., for The News. The News has had problems with its presses,
curtailing the number of lucrative color ads it could sell, and
lost a lawsuit against Goss Graphic Systems, which supplied the
presses.
</P>
<P>
   The News is also caught up in a potentially expensive
arbitration dispute with its drivers, and its circulation has
declined.
</P>
<P>
   In some cities where hard economics have threatened to kill
newspapers, the government has sanctioned cost-cutting agreements
in which two papers share production, distribution and even
business operations while keeping separate newsrooms and editorial
voices. The Post-Daily News talks apparently never broached such
far-reaching cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the two sides appeared to back away from the contacts
Friday, the old rivalries rose to the surface, and there seemed to
be so little common ground that Chandler and Zuckerman could not
even agree on who had initiated the contacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of Mr. Murdoch called me and said they would like to
get together and talk, so we did,'' Zuckerman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Chandler recalled it differently. ``The Daily News reached
out to us and asked if we would be interested in ways to share some
production costs.''
</P>
<P>
   And Zuckerman said: ``I think they are losing an immense amount
of money. To merge two very complicated processes on an operational
level would be difficult.''

EDITORIAL: JUDGE KORMAN'S ELECTION ORDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Feb. 5:
</P>
<P>
   By approving a legal settlement Friday opening the ballot of New
York's March 7 Republican presidential primary, U.S. District Judge
Edward Korman gave Republicans in the state something Republicans
elsewhere take for granted. That, of course, is the opportunity to
choose from a full slate of presidential candidates, including John
McCain, George Bush, Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes. Gov. George
Pataki's attempt to rig the election for Bush by keeping McCain off
the ballot in many parts of the state led to a humiliating
political reversal for the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and his co-conspirator in the plot against McCain,
William Powers, the state Republican chairman, were routed. Their
lawyers were forced to admit that the ballot laws they and Pataki
had been defending did, in fact, place an ``undue burden'' on
voting rights protected under the First Amendment. The lawyers also
had to promise not to appeal Korman's rulings. Zenia Mucha, the
communications director who also helped Pataki and Powers
mastermind this disaster, added a comic-opera touch of nonsense by
accusing McCain of pursuing the ballot-access issue because his
campaign was ``devoid of ideas.'' But there was no disguising the
fact that political defeats can be no more thorough nor more deeply
deserved than Pataki's.
</P>
<P>
   Korman's ruling takes care of this primary. But Pataki is a
recidivist ballot trickster, having deployed a similar scheme four
years ago to try to prevent Forbes and others from competing
statewide against his then favorite, Bob Dole. It is a fair bet
that in future elections New Yorkers can look forward to other
attempts at ballot manipulation unless the law is changed.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki can begin to repair his national reputation by
immediately offering legislation putting New York in line with
states like California and Connecticut, which automatically put all
recognized presidential candidates on their primary ballots. While
they are at it, Pataki and the Legislature should clean up the
ballot access rules for state and local races, too.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Pataki has shown too little interest in a new law. ``We
have plenty of time to deal with what happens four years from
now,'' says another of his spokesmen, Michael McKeon. But if time
is allowed to elapse, history suggests Korman's strong message will
be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki needs to lead if he really believes that New York
elections should be about ``issues, not about technicalities'' like
those he formerly defended. A spokesman for the state Senate's
majority leader, Joseph Bruno, says Bruno is waiting for Pataki to
act. That sounds like another Republican establishment excuse for
doing nothing to clean up New York elections. Fortunately, the
state Senate's Democratic minority leader, Martin Connor, plans to
call the question next week by offering legislation to ensure an
open ballot in 2004. There is no excuse for delay. Other major
states manage to hold presidential primaries without embarrassing
ballot fights and, for that matter, without embarrassing
anti-democratic behavior by their governors. So should New York.

THERE'S A LOT OF ONTARIO IN ALL-STAR BLAKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The cornfields of his childhood are now covered with
snow, but for Rob Blake this is harvest time.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is he headed to this weekend's NHL All-Star Game in
Toronto, Blake is also returning home to the wide-open spaces of
southern Ontario, where the images of a youngster bounding out the
back door with a stick and a pair of ice skates are as familiar and
common as the Canadian soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left here when he was 16 and he's really never been back,''
Blake's father Robert said. ``That's the hockey life. But we think
he takes a lot of this place wherever he goes.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past 10 years, Blake has brought that rare blend of hard
work, hockey talent and humility to the Los Angeles Kings. He is
more than their captain and best player. He is Gary Cooper standing
at the blue line.
</P>
<P>
   High noon will come Sunday at the Air Canada Centre, where he
will make his first start as a defenseman for the North American
team. He has been to All-Star games two other times, earned the
right to gripe about the inconvenience when he could be sitting by
the pool with his wife Brandy in Manhattan Beach.
</P>
<P>
   But Blake has never looked at it that way. And just as important
as proving himself against the best players in the world is the
rare opportunity to visit his native Simcoe, a town of 15,000 that
is 90 minutes from Toronto but light years from the big city.
</P>
<P>
   It was on 200 acres of soy and corn that Blake grew up with his
sister and two brothers, always striving to compete with the older
ones and their friends. And like a Kings dressing room after a
tough loss, the neighbor kids often would come to Blake and ask,
``What are we going to do now?''
</P>
<P>
   It was there that he assumed the family passion for the Maple
Leafs, although he never saw a game in legendary Maple Leaf Gardens
until he played there his rookie year in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey was about playing, and playing some more. Like the farm
day that begins before sunup and ends well after sundown, the sport
in Canada is never done part-time. ``When I think about being
driven to all those practices at 6 o'clock in the morning, I know
this game is as much for them as it is for me,'' Blake said of his
family. ``I saw them last weekend when we were in Toronto and my
parents' tickets were just three rows from the ice. I could see
them everytime I went by and I know I have never been so nervous
during a game in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Each small town had a rink and a team, which gave the youngsters
a place to play and the parents a social life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're used to sitting in a freezing arena, dressed up in big
boots and watching the game,'' Robert Sr. said. ``For the parents
it was a good way to catch up on things that were going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Rob honed his game playing on local teams, but his drive
to excel developed trying to show his brother Russell, who is three
years older, that he was good enough to play with the big kids.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't loud but had a boundless energy that made him a
natural leader. ``The phone was always ringing,'' Robert Sr. said.
``Whether it was hockey or basketball or whatever, everyone always
looked to Robert to see what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   His boyhood idol was Larry Robinson, the quiet but imposing
defenseman who helped the Montreal Canadiens to Stanley Cup
championships and later became Blake's teammate and coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often get asked what it is like to have a family that has a
son who is so rich and famous,'' said Robert Sr., who has an older
daughter, Leah, Russell and a younger son David. ``It would be easy
to pay all the attention to Robert, but the way we've done it is to
see all of them as their own person and try to satisfy their
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was 15, Blake began to develop an extended family
away from the farm. He was playing an hour away in Branford, Ont.,
home of Wayne Gretzky. The team was disbanded for fighting and
Blake moved up the road to a team in Stratford, where an assistant
was a friend of Terry York, hockey coach at Bowling Green
University in Ohio. Blake received a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   York, now the coach at Boston College, previously had run the
program at Clarkson University in upstate New York. His top player
there had been Dave Taylor, the former Kings forward and now
general manager. After Blake was chosen by Kings as the 70th
overall pick in the 1990 draft, York went to Taylor with a request.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I want you to look after him,' '' Taylor said. ``I
said OK, but then he gave me a stern look and said, `No, I want you
to take care of him. This kid is special.' I was his first roommate
on the road. Terry was right, he was special. You could tell from
the first day.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the draft, the Blakes climbed into the family car
for the long drive to Montreal. It is a story Robert Sr. recalled
at the reception of his son's wedding in 1998 and teammates laugh
about it to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Jr. was at the wheel and driving erratically because of
the nervousness of his pending selection. As they approached
Montreal, a driver from behind became annoyed and started laying on
the horn. ``It was clear this guy wanted a fight,'' Blake said.
``All of sudden we're in traffic jam and the car is stopped. He got
out and we got out and now it's this little guy against all of us.
We all got back in the car but then looked out and saw my mother in
the middle of the road shaking her fist at the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   As Blake's Kings career grew, his time at home dwindled. He got
back in the summer, but his father remembered how disappointed they
were when he would fly in Christmas eve and fly back to the team
Christmas night.
</P>
<P>
   They saw him when the Kings were in Toronto and drove to watch
him in Detroit and Buffalo. There were visits to California during
the season to escape the often harsh Canadian winters.
</P>
<P>
   Their boy suddenly was the man, living the single life in trendy
Manhattan Beach. He had come of age during the Kings' Stanley Cup
run in 1993, providing solid defense for the Gretzky-run offense.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he was earning $5 million a year and was awarded the Norris
Trophy as the league's top defenseman after the 1997-98 season.
With his blond good looks, Blake was plastered on the sides of
buses and the front pages of sports sections. He married a model
and bought a luxury suite at the new Staples Center to entertain
underprivileged children. Five times when the season was over he
hopped on a plane to play for the Canadian National Hockey team
during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a hard thing to do after a long season,'' said Kings
coach Andy Murray, who coached the team to a world championship in
1997. ``But when you phone up a player like Rob Blake and ask him
to play, when you hear him say yes, it's better than the games.''
</P>
<P>
   But the good life came at a price. Four years ago, he missed
nearly the entire season after tearing the ACL in his left knee in
the sixth game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every player goes through injuries and misses a few games, but
when you go out for the season, there is nothing more isolating
than that,'' Blake said. `They don't want you around the team and
you are totally on your own. My parents came down for the first two
weeks and helped me get settled. I would have been lost without
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, things were almost as bad when Robinson, who had
gotten the Kings back to the playoffs in 1998, was fired. Blake was
healthy, but instead of building on their previous playoff
experience, the team went 32-45-5. Robinson, a great locker-room
presence during his playing career, lost control of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't play for him and it was very sad,'' Blake said.
``When I first got here, we played together. I don't know if I
actually learned anything from what he said, but I learned so much
just from the way he carried himself in the dressing room and on
the ice. I look at him now (as an assistant) in New Jersey and he
is so happy. He would be a great coach on a successful team.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Kings coach is Murray, whom Blake pushed for the job.
The Kings had the best record in hockey earlier in the year but
have struggled since mid-December. This weekend is a good break
from the action for Blake, a chance to see familiar faces and catch
up on old times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember my first trip to the farm,'' said Brandy. ``It was
the first time I met his parents and I was really nervous. But his
dad let me drive the combine that cuts the fields. He doesn't even
let Rob do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're supposed to cut in a straight line, but I was running
circles all over the place. His dad never said a word. It was a
great trip and we'll probably go back there for the summers after
he retires. There is so much of him there.''

<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ The two weeks of diplomatic whipping that
Austria has absorbed over the inclusion of Joerg Haider's
anti-immigrant Freedom Party in its new government has been quite
extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, that coalition government took office at a tense
ceremony, as protesters clashed with riot policemen outside, and
the diplomatic breach widened. Washington quickly recalled its
ambassador ``for consultations,'' and European governments began
downgrading their relations with Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Italy had a neo-Fascist party in its government in 1994, and
Europe did not threaten to blackball its diplomats, nor did the
Belgian foreign minister say it would be immoral to ski in the
Italian Alps.
</P>
<P>
   And many European countries _ to say nothing of the eastern
European ones lining up to join _ have had Communists in government
who have made excuses for Stalin or other dictators. Plenty have
cozy diplomatic relations with dictators from Cuba to Libya to
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, a rupture with Austria has happened before.When
the nation elected Kurt Waldheim president in 1986 after it was
revealed that he had served with Hitler's army in the Balkans in
World War II, the country was put under virtual diplomatic boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Waldheim, a previous two-term secretary-general of the United
Nations, was barred from entering the United States in May 1987, a
ban that remains in effect. He made few state visits during his
six-year term as president, and Austria, which was then negotiating
to join the European Union, received almost no official American or
West European visitors of note except for Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   The warning on Monday that 14 members of the European Union
could isolate the 15th arrived with virtually no public debate. The
foreign ministers met in secret _ exactly how many is not clear,
since at least one, from Denmark, told a newspaper that he was
informed so late that there was not even time to disagree.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction from Haider, attacking Belgium as corrupt and
France's president as confused and incompetent, was hardly
diplomatic. But the counterattacks from seasoned European diplomats
_ who repeated their accusations that Haider was a racist, a
xenophobe and a Nazi sympathizer _ were also blunt.
</P>
<P>
   Going beyond his remark about the immorality of skiing in the
Austrian Alps if Haider was in power, the Belgian foreign minister
even said Europe could do without Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, European diplomats would not even take the word
of Wolfgang Schuessel, Haider's coalition partner, that Haider is
not as bad as they think. Schuessel, who has been Austria's foreign
minister for four years, presumably knows them all, but the usual
collegial courtesies were not extended.
</P>
<P>
   And before President Thomas Klestil would sanction the coalition
between Schuessel's People's Party and Haider's Freedom Party, he
made them sign an extraordinary declaration that he seemed to have
drawn up overnight.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long, somewhat rambling pledge called ``Responsibility
for Austria _ A Future in the Heart of Europe,'' promising
adherence to the spiritual and moral values of Europe, recognizing
charters on peace and monetary union, accepting responsibility for
Nazism, and even suggesting that compensation might be paid to
forced laborers.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Schuessel and Haider signed away their right to pass
any national legislation that disagrees with the thinking of the
European Union _ except that, since the document does not mention
any court that could enforce it, they do not have to keep their
word. It was done for show.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions on how Austria ended up in such a weak position vary
depending on whom one asks.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the answer is simple: Hitler was an Austrian, and
everyone in Europe has at least a grandparent who remembers the
Nazis. ``After all,'' said Sylvie Rais, a Frenchwoman who said she
has been arguing all week with her Iranian-born husband about
Europe's moral position, ``Austria is le ventre de la bete,''
literally, the womb of the beast.
</P>
<P>
   The French newspapers have been unabashed about casting the Nazi
shadow over the current Austrian political deal. The cover of
Friday's Liberation, the liberal French daily, was a sepia-tinted
photo of Schuessel and Haider under the headline ``The Brown
Waltz'' _ a blending of Vienna's classic dance and brown-shirted
storm troopers.
</P>
<P>
   That only confirms the fears of Elfi Dobusch, 56, who brought
Haider some chocolate for his 50th birthday last week, and said
other Europeans were upset about his rise ``because our historical
past isn't pure _ but people should forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask politicians, and one hears that it was pure power politics.
Many believe, as has been reported in Europe, that Klestil, a
senior Austrian diplomat during the Waldheim crisis, and former
Chancellor Viktor Klima, a Social Democrat whose party came in
first in the elections in October but was squeezed out of power by
the new coalition, called friends around Europe and asked them to
chime in with condemnations of Haider. As luck would have it, many
of those leaders are center-leftists who were at a Holocaust
conference in Stockholm, so the stage could hardly have been more
perfectly set.
</P>
<P>
   Also, many European countries have right-wing movements, and
this would signal them that they too could be crushed. In France,
whose conservative president, Jacques Chirac, was in the forefront
of the overwhelmingly leftist attacks on Haider, Jean-Marie Le
Pen's openly racist National Front won 15 percent of the vote in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Others quietly say the Portuguese, who now hold the rotating
presidency of the European Union, wanted their tenure to be
remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Among analysts of European affairs, the answers get more
complex, and divide on whether the speaker feels Haider should have
been kept out of government at all costs or should be accepted out
of respect for democracy, and then watched carefully.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There are now fundamental accepted values, and a line is
crossed when someone who's expressed sympathy for the Third Reich
is allowed in,'' said John Palmer of the European Policy Center, a
Brussels-based research institute. In 1996, the European Union
passed the Amsterdam treaty on democracy and human rights with
provisions for expelling members.
</P>
<P>
   It was drafted in anticipation of new Eastern European members;
if Romania, for instance, relapsed into dictatorship, it could be
kicked out. It was never intended as a bludgeon for democracies
like Austria, but now European leaders are asserting the right to
judge just what is a democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Another camp argues that Austria got what it got because the
rest of the European Union just does not like it very much.
</P>
<P>
   Austria has never been a team player. It joined the European
Union only in 1995, after the isolation of the Waldheim era and the
European unity fostered by the fall of the Berlin Wall enabled it
to pull away from the neutrality it had to promise to get Soviet
troops to withdraw in 1955, thus ending 10 years of Allied
occupation. Like fellow union member Sweden, Austria still clings
to that neutrality when it comes to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been half-hearted on defense policy,'' said
Charles Grant of the Center for European Reform, another research
institute. Unlike Sweden, Austria is in a sensitive strategic area.
It has joined NATO's so-called Partnership for Peace, but has not
applied for alliance membership; last spring, it refused to let
NATO planes fly over to bomb nearby Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   And Austria has few supporters with European heft, Grant argued.
``France has always been hostile, and a little bit contemptuous of
Austria,'' he said. Germany, still sensitive about annexing Austria
under the Nazis in 1938, was not a big brother, but had ``the same
difficult relationship that Britain does with Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the opportunity to condemn Nazism is not one that
vote-seeking European politicians like to miss. And it is
considerably easier to threaten a country like Austria, with 8
million people and an admittedly ambivalent relationship to its
Nazi past, than a country of 77 million people who spend German
marks and who have atoned much longer and more openly for Nazi
crimes.

UCLA TOURNAMENT HOPES DIMMING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The second season _ the important season, the
season that determines the postseason _ begins today for UCLA. Its
margin for error, already small, is approaching microscopic.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (12-7, 3-5) must win six of their last 11 games to
reach the 18-victory plateau that probably would secure an NCAA
Tournament bid. (In the last four years, every Pacific-10 team with
18 wins and a .500 or better conference record has made the
tournament.)
</P>
<P>
   Where does UCLA get six wins? How does it avoid six losses?
Here's the most realistic scenario:
</P>
<P>
   __Give the Bruins three victories at home: Oregon State,
Washington and Washington State. (If they can't beat those teams in
Pauley Pavilion, they probably don't deserve a bid in the first
place.)
</P>
<P>
   __Give them three defeats on the road: No.2 Stanford, No.4
Syracuse and No.9 Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   __That leaves five games against middle-tier teams, of which the
Bruins must win three: Cal (twice), USC at home, Oregon at home,
Arizona State on the road.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if the Bruins lose at home, they must win on the
road. The way they're playing, with five losses in nine games, they
can't count on winning in Berkeley or Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's Feb. 5. Yes, it's the first round of league play. But
the Bruins are in a must-win game today.
</P>
<P>
   Next up: In case Cal's victory over USC didn't get UCLA's
attention, Stanford coach Mike Montgomery issued a warning after
Thursday's victory over the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cal's a little up and down ... but they're very capable,''
Montgomery said. ``Our game with them was very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Sign of trouble: Stanford had a 16-point halftime lead, a
20-point second-half lead and won by 15 despite an uncharacteristic
23 turnovers. Imagine the final score if Stanford had handled the
ball with its usual care.
</P>
<P>
   Sign of trouble II: UCLA senior Sean Farnham on the Stanford
game: ``We're trying to look for positives, and what we take from
this is that we competed.''
</P>
<P>
   Shouldn't that be a given?
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: Center Dan Gadzuric is averaging six points and
3.8 rebounds in his last five games.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Earl Watson is shooting 35.4 percent from the field
in his last seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Subtract his career-high 22-point performance at Oregon State
and shooting guard Ray Young is averaging 3.1 points and shooting
23.5 percent in seven conference games.
</P>
<P>
   What's worse than UCLA's pathetic free-throw shooting (58.9
percent)? That's easy: its free-throw shooting in league play (54.8
percent).
</P>
<P>
   Rush update: UCLA does not expect the results of JaRon Rush's
appeal until next week. Rush has declined to comment on the
specifics of his case, but UCLA released a statement on his behalf:
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to say that I am sorry that all of this has
created problems (or) worries for people who care about me
especially my team, the coaches and the athletic staff at UCLA, and
my family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very grateful for the encouragement I have received from
my teammates, my family, and friends and fans in Los Angeles and at
home in Kansas City. My goals right now are to succeed in school
and to play basketball again for UCLA as soon as I can.''

NEWSPAPER APOLOGIZES FOR CRASH STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   With ALASKA-CRASH  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Seattle Times published a front-page clarification
and apology Friday regarding a discredited story that the MD-83
aircraft that crashed on Monday had experienced mechanical problems
on its next-to-last flight.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines Flight 261 plunged into the Pacific Ocean off
Los Angeles with the loss of all 88 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The top headlined story in some Wednesday editions of the
newspaper said Alaska Airlines pilots had reported problems with
the horizontal stabilizer of the aircraft on a flight to Mexico
just hours before it crashed. That story quoted an unnamed ``senior
mechanic'' at the airline.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday that the
pilots denied that report. The pilots said the aircraft had
``performed in a normal manner with no system malfunctions'' on the
last two flights before it crashed.
</P>
<P>
   The Times said Friday that it had been unable to reach the
mechanic, whom it described as a ``regularly reliable source.''
Alex MacLeod, the afternoon paper's managing editor, said it issued
the apology because its story Wednesday seemed ``misleading and
incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   But MacLeod said he could not say whether subsequent
developments in the investigation or a second interview with the
mechanic will continue to show that the story was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's clarification The Times said it apologized to Alaska
Airlines employees and the paper's readers.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Times and Seattle Post-Intelligencer share some
business operations, but are owned by different corporations and
operate out of different buildings. Their newsrooms _ including
reporters, editors and columnists _ and their opinion pages are
separate and independent.
