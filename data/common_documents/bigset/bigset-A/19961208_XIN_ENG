<HEADLINE> Japan, U.S. to Continue Talks in Spite of Disagreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Japan and the United States
failed to settle their prolonged dispute over the opening of the
400 billion-U.S.-dollar Japanese insurance market, after two days
of high-level talks, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
But Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka and acting
U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Charlene Barshefsky agreed to
hold another round of talks in Tokyo on December 14 in a
last-ditch effort to strike a deal by the self-imposed deadline of
December 15, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of the ministerial talks, the two countries will hold a
working-level meeting in Tokyo on Sunday and Monday between Eisuke
Sakaibara, head of the Finance Ministry's International Finance
Bureau, and Ira Shapiro, senior counsel and negotiator at the
Office of the USTR.
</P>
<P>
The insurance dispute centers on U.S. allegations that Japan
will violate a 1994 accord if it opens up the so-called "third
sector" of its insurance market before substantially deregulating
the primary life and non-life insurance sectors, which are
dominated by the Japanese domestic companies.
</P>
<P>
The third sector covers cancer, personal accident,
hospitalization and other insurance policies that fall into a grey
area between the life and non-life insurance businesses.
</P>
<P>
Although it accounts for only 5 percent of Japan's overall
insurance market, the third sector is the only one in which
foreign insurance groups have a firm foothold and has become a
major source of earnings for them.
</P>
<P>
After failing to narrow differences in several rounds of talks,
the two countries agreed in October to impose a December 15
deadline, with Japan freezing the entry of newly licensed
subsidiaries of major life and non-life insurers into the third
sector until December 31.
</P>
<P>
Japan has insisted that if no insurance accord is reached by
December 15, it will allow the subsidiaries to sell third-sector
products from January 1.
</P>
<P>
Washington has threatened to retaliate if Tokyo authorizes
their entry without first striking an agreement with the
U.S.

<HEADLINE> National Tree Day Observed in Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 7 (xinhua) -- Thousands of parents and
students in Harare today celebrated the annual national tree
planting day, whose theme this year is ''community management of
trees and forests for national prosperity''.
</P>
<P>
The national tree day falls on every first Saturday of
December every year.
</P>
<P>
At today's tree planting ceremony, President Robert Mugabe
stressed time has come for the government to place local
communities in the forefront of the national tree planting
exercise.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had initiated a legislative and policy
reform process that would facilitate the management of
environmental resources, including trees, forests and woodlands
by local communities.
</P>
<P>
He also called on more private sector organizations to
exercise their social responsibility by supporting community tree
planting efforts.
</P>
<P>
In his message on the occasion of today's national tree
planting day, Minister of Environment and Tourism Chen
Chimutengwende warned Zimbabwe is heading for an environmental
and ecological disaster if it loses any more of its remaining
forests.
</P>
<P>
The country has already lost some of its most treasured flora
and fauna and if the situation continues unchecked, the country
will soon be among ''the league of environmental and ecological
disaster zones'', he said.
</P>
<P>
He has therefore reminded all Zimbabweans to redouble their
efforts in combating deforestation and desertification to enhance
global enrironmental awareness campaigns.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Parliament Speaker Says No to Rifkind's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' House of
Representatives President Spyros Kyprianou has suggested to
postpone the first official visit by a British Foreign Secretary
in 36 years on belief that the visit is ill-intentioned.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou raised this issue with President Glafcos Clerides at
a meeting this morning, according to the state radio Cyprus
Broadcasting Corporation (CyBC).
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Office announced Friday that Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind will visit Cyprus from December 16-17 for meetings
with Cypriot leaders on the possibility of a solution to the
Cyprus problem next year.
</P>
<P>
However, Rifkind has come under heavy fire on the island over a
comment he made last week in the House of Commons that the entry
of a divided Cyprus to the EU would be difficult.
</P>
<P>
He also has been criticized for his planned meeting with
Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash, which Cypriot politicians see as
a form of recognition of the Turkish Cypriot self-claimed republic
in northern Cyprus, which is only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
According to the radio, Kyprianou, who is also the leader
of the center-right Democratic Party, believed that Rifkind would
come to Cyprus especially to meet Denktash and "not for any
other reason", an intention that he described as "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the British Secretary could meet Clerides
and Michaelides on the sidelines of the EU summit in Dublin next
week while Britain's representative for Cyprus David Hannay could
see Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on Rifkind's remark that a solution to
the Cyprus problem must be found before the start of
membership talks with the EU, Kyprianou stressed that this
position "does not only constitute pressure, but a blackmail."
</P>
<P>
He said he had no anti-British feelings "but we confront
moves by Britain that might harm a great deal the Cyprus
cause."
</P>
<P>
Rifkind's planned visit will be the first by a British Foreign
Secretary since 1960, when the island, a former British colony
became an independent Republic, apart from a visit by his
predecessor Douglas Hurd during the Commonwealth Heads of
Government Meeting in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Britain together with Greece and Turkey were the guarantors
of Cyprus' independence under the 1960 Treaty of establishment
of the Cyprus Republic.

<HEADLINE> Plane Crash Kills 16 in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen people were killed and
three others injured today when a small plane plunged into a gas
factory roof, 23 kilometers from Banjarmasin in South Kalimantan
province of Indonesia, local TV reported tonight.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which carried 17 passengers on board, crashed at
15:30 local time a few minutes after it took off from the Bandar
Syamsuddin Noor airport.
</P>
<P>
The airport said that two of the passengers, a young girl named
Rusdiana and an unidentified adult, survived the crash.
</P>
<P>
Those killed included pilot Heri Bert, co-pilot Sofyan Noor and
a factory employee on the ground, while three employees of the
factory sustained serious injuries, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The plane, owned by the private airline company Pt. Dirgantara
Air Service, was flying from the provincial capital of Banjarmasin
to Sampit in Central Kalimantan.
</P>
<P>
According to chief of the rescue team Rusliansyah, shortly
after taking off from the airport, the plane's left engine caught
fire and disintegrated, causing the plane to lose balance and ram
into the factory.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire on the left engine was still unknown, and
it was drizzling when the accident took place, eyewitnesses said.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Meets With Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
held talks this afternoon with Palestinian National Authority
(PA) leader Yasser Arafat on ways to activate the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed ways to push forward the talks on
Israeli troop redeployment in Hebron, the last West Bank town
still under Israeli control, and implement the peace accords
signed with former Labor government.
</P>
<P>
The discussions also covered the outcome of the talks between
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu during the recent meetings of the Organization
of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting were Mahmoud Abbas, member of the
PLO Executive Committee, Zohdi Kadra, Palestinian Ambassador to
Egypt and Yasser Abed Rabbo, Palestinian minister of culture and
information.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to have diplomatic ties with the
Jewish state, has recently stepped up its attacks against the
Israeli policy of expanded settlements in occupied Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
The Mubarak-Arafat meeting came amid some conflicting
local reports Friday that Arafat and Netanyahu would meet in
Cairo within two days at the invitation of Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Both Arafat and Netanyahu have reportedly shown willingness to
meet each other to reach an agreement on Hebron. Local press said
that Netanyahu asserted Friday that time is ripe to meet with
Arafat to complete the deal on Hebron, and that Arafat gave a
positive answer with no less promptness.
</P>
<P>
But Palestinian Minister of Local Government Saeb Erekat and
Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Nabil Sha'ath
ruled out the possibility of such a meeting without an agreement
eliminating pending differences in the Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The redeployment issue has long been delayed due to Israeli
demand on "hot pursuit" inside the Palestinian area to protect
some 450 Jewish settlers who are living among 120,000
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, U.S. Mideast peace coordinator Dennis
Ross said in Washington Friday that an expected meeting between
Arafat and Netanyahu may lead to a sort of progress.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: U.S. Welfare Rolls Reduced by 2.1 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Saturday that the welfare rolls have been reduced by 2.1
million people over his four years in office, with reductions in
45 of the 50 states.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called it "the biggest drop in the welfare rolls in
history," in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
In Wisconsin, there was a 41 percent reduction in people
receiving welfare, and in Indiana, a 38 percent drop, Clinton
said. Both states were granted "landmark waivers" by his
administration to launch their own welfare reform experiments
emphasizing work.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton said there is obviously much more to do, including
the recruitment of businesses to provide jobs for those remaining
on the welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
The next step, he said, is for the states to implement the new
welfare overhaul law by tailoring reform plans to their
communities.
</P>
<P>
He said the reform plans of 14 states had already been
certified and announced.
</P>
<P>
"All their plans will require and reward work, impose time
limits, increase child care payments and demand personal
responsibility," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said a hurdle remains.
</P>
<P>
"Now we have to create a million jobs for people on welfare by
giving businesses incentives to hire people off welfare and
enlisting the private sector in a national effort to bring all
Americans into the economic mainstream," he said. "We have to have
help from the private sector."
</P>
<P>
The government found reductions in the welfare rolls over the
last four years in every state but Idaho, Mew Mexico, California,
Alaska and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the Republicans' radio address, Senator Dan Coats of
Indiana urged Clinton to go beyond his general calls for
bipartisanship between the Republican-led Congress and the White
House and "get more specific."

<HEADLINE> Ten Bank Robberies in Washington Area in A Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Two Arlington banks were
robbed on Friday, bringing to 10 the number of bank robberies in
the Washington, D.C. area within this week, Washington Post said
today.
</P>
<P>
The robberies this week also put the number of bank robberies
to 461 so far this year in Maryland and Northern Virginia states
and the District of Columbia, 17 more than all of last year, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Friday's bank robberies occurred at First Virginia Bank
branches. The first was at around 9:30 a.m. in Crystal City. A man
with a handgun entered the bank, demanded cash and then fled on
foot. The second took place at around 10:30 a.m. at a branch at
Fort Myer Drive. It was robbed by two men wearing bandanas to
cover their faces and drove away, police said.
</P>
<P>
The two robberies brought the total in Arlington, adjacent to
D.C., so far this year to 16, three more than the total of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Fairfax County, another suburban D.C. area, has had
29 bank robberies this year, 70 percent more than all of last
year, and Alexadria has had 14, a 110 percent increase from 1995,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
A Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) official said that some
bank robbers are paying off gambling debts or supporting their
drug habits and others are simply for money. There are people who
are har-core unemployed and who are without jobs or a steady
income.

CAIRO, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Polish Council
of Ministers Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz arrived here this afternoon
heading a high-level delegation on an official visit to Egypt to
promote economic ties.
</P>
<P>
He will hold talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
his counterpart Kamal El-Ganzouri Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The talks will center on Poland's stance towards the Mideast
peace process, the issue on expanding the membership of the U.N.
Security Council, means of boosting economic and trade ties and
reducing the two countries' trade gap, according to the Egyptian
Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
When meeting Cimoszewicz at his arrival, Ganzouri said that the
four-day visit by the Polish prime minister will give a push to
the existing relations between Egypt and Poland.
</P>
<P>
He added that he will review with Cimoszewicz the economic
reform policies in both countries and the progress they have made
through different approaches.
</P>
<P>
The two premiers will discuss prospects for raising the trade
volume now standing at 60 million U.S. dollars, Ganzouri said,
adding that joint ventures and the general frame of cooperation
will also feature on the agenda of the talks.
</P>
<P>
The trade turnover between Poland and the Arab world accounts
for only one percent of its foreign trade, he noted.

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy: EU to Help Coordinate Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The newly-appointed European
Union's (EU) Middle East peace envoy Miguel Angel Moratinos said
today Europe will play a coordinating role in support of the
U.S. efforts in bolstering the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival here from Amman, Jordan, this afternoon,
Moratinos was quoted by Egypt's Middle East News Agency as
saying that he is here to get acquainted with the Egyptian
viewpoint regarding the European role in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Europe is to maintain its role to promote the peace march in a
way to assist the United States and to conciliate views of the
parties concerned, the EU official said, who is on a two-day
visit to the Arab country.
</P>
<P>
The process requires the orchestration of efforts by the
parties concerned, including the European Union, said the EU
envoy.
</P>
<P>
The main task of the EU is to convince Israel of implementing
the signed agreements, he said, urging an eased situation in the
region for leaders and peoples to make the right decisions, and
for the peace process to move ahead.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos said the appointment of new U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright would not affect the U.S. role in the Mideast
peace march.
</P>
<P>
The EU coordinator will hold talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa Sunday on the
latest developments of the deadlocked peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos, who is also Spain's ambassador to Israel, is
currently making his first Mideast tour since his appointment in
October. The tour, which has already taken him to Israel, the
Palestinian self-rule areas and Jordan, will take him to Syria
and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the United States, a co-sponsor of the peace process
initiated in Madrid in 1991, have been cool to an European role.
</P>
<P>
But Moratinos' appointment was welcomed by the Palestinians
who have been seeking a more active European role, since the
right-wing Israeli government led by Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu took office last June.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, U.S. Mideast coordinator Dennis Ross
reportedly expressed "cautious optimism" over achieving a
breakthrough in the region but said he did not expect "dramatic
developments" after Albright's appointment.
</P>
<P>
He said that Albright participated in drawing up the
U.S. foreign policies during President Clinton's first term in
office and understood the general guidelines of the situation in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Middle East policy would not be changed, he added.

<P>

countries and peoples is a necessity and an obligation to

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldier Killed, 6 Civilians Wounded in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 7 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli soldier was killed in
a bomb explosion in south Lebanon this afternoon and six other
civilians were wounded in a following attack in revenge by
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas of the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of
God, launched a bomb attack at an Israeli patrol, killing one
Israeli soldier and wounding another.
</P>
<P>
Following the attack, Israeli occupation forces in the
so-called "security zone" bombarded south Lebanese villages,
wounding at least six civilians.
</P>
<P>
Fighters of the Islamic Resistance, the military wing of
Hezbollah, detonated a mine at 1:45 p.m. (11:45 GMT) near the
crusade castle of Shakif deeply inside the Israeli self-styled
buffer zone in the area.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Beirut, the guerrilla group
announced that its fighters carried out the attack when an
Israeli patrol comprising two armored vehicles and a number of
infantries was marching along the road between Burj and Shakif.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese security sources quoted witnesses in the
Israeli-occupied border strip as confirming that one Israeli
soldier was killed and another was wounded in the guerrilla
operation.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses in Arnoun, Nabatiyeh, reported that one Israeli tank
was completedly destroyed, black smoke rose high into the sky
and the explosion echoed in a far distance.
</P>
<P>
They said that Israeli military ambulances were seen rushing
to the scene to transfer the wounded.
</P>
<P>
Today's casualties added to 25 the Israeli soldiers killed by
Hezbollah guerrillas on the last active battle front of the
Arab-Israeli conflict since this year.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for the guerrilla attack, Israeli artillery
opened fire at the south Lebanese villages of Nabatiyeh, Fawqa
and Kfar Tibinit an hour later, leaving six villagers in
Kfar Tibinit wounded, in addition to serious damages.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the area said that the Israeli forces
fired from the positions of Shakif and Zaffateh, and used the
internationally-banned cluster bombs.
</P>
<P>
The wounded civilians were hospitalized in the south Lebanese
market town of Nabatiyeh.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese security sources accused the Israeli forces of
violating an April cease-fire understanding mediated by the
United States between the Jewish state and Lebanon's Hezbollah,
which ended a 17-day Israeli blitz in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The understanding banned both the Israeli forces and Hezbollah
guerrillas from attacking at civilians or launching attacks from
civilian areas, while it allows Muslim guerrillas to attack
Israeli occupation forces and gives the Israelis the right of
self-defense.

<HEADLINE> First Sino-Foreign Tourism Joint Venture Set Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Three travel agencies,
respectively headquartered in Shenzhen, Japan and Hong Kong,
signed a joint-venture agreement here Saturday to set up the
Huaming International Tourism Company Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The new company will be located in this special economic zone
in Guangdong Province, and will be the country's first
Sino-foreign joint venture in the tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
The firm has a registered capital of one million US dollars,
with the Shenzhen City Tourism Group taking 60 percent of the
shares and each of the two overseas firms taking 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The city government hopes to be able to to strengthen
Shenzhen's capability to receive overseas tourists by allowing
some local tourism agencies to join hands with overseas agencies.
</P>
<P>
According to the city's blueprint for its tourism industry, by
the year 2010 Shenzhen is expected to receive 6.2 million overseas
travelers, an annual increase of eight to ten percent, and 10.6
million domestic sightseers, and earning five billion US dollars
in foreign exchange from the industry.
</P>
<P>
Currently, as a major tourist city, Shenzhen has more than

city earned 858 million US dollars in foreign exchange from
tourism, ranking third among all Chinese cities.

<HEADLINE> China Steps Up Pollution-Control Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is
taking substantial measures to bolster environmental protection in
cities in a bid to reach its goal of realizing basic control of
environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, director of the State Bureau of Environmental
Protection, made the remark today at the end of the four-day First
National Work Conference on the Control of Environmental Pollution
in this capital of East China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The official urged local environmental-protection authorities
to escalate their law-enforcement efforts by closing down some
enterprises that are severely polluting the environment, so as to
ensure a smooth implementation of the government's anti-pollution
policies.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), the Decision by
the State Council on Several Issues Concerning Environmental
Protection should be seriously carried out, he said. New sources of
pollution must be put under strict control.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the meeting discussed a number of relevant laws
that will be issued soon.
</P>
<P>
According to the participants, China has been gradually setting
up and improving a legal system to protect the environment, and
the efforts have been extended from cities to larger areas,
efficiently improving the environmental quality in general.
</P>
<P>
However, the participants said they feared that the environment
may deteriorate along with the speedy economic growth in the
coming 15 years. They held that the environment will be affected
if the government does not take stronger measures to curb
environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
Some officials noted that in the Ninth Five-Year Plan period
the main task for China regarding environmental protection
is to firmly shut down severe polluters such as small paper mills,
leather factories and plating factories.
</P>
<P>
They also called for setting a time-table for all industrial
polluters to tackle the problem in accordance with the law,
practising control of the general volume of pollution discharge,
requiring cities to reach the national standards on environmental
quality, and realizing an obvious improvement of water quality in
major rivers.
</P>
<P>
To reach the goal, the government has decided to further
improve environmental protection laws and regulations, and the
detailed provisions for the implementation of these legislative
rules, they noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, local environmental protection
authorities are asked to set up technological support teams for
pollution control to provide managerial and technological
assistance to relevant administrative departments.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Adjustment Over Economic Structure (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chen stressed that the current restructuring is aimed at
further improving the administration of investment and state
industrial policies, with strict control over the launching of new
projects. It will also deepen the reform of the planning and
investment systems.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country also plans to strengthen the
information sector regarding investment in fixed assets and to
find a substantial solution for the problem of overlapping
construction, so as to put the economic development onto a the
new track during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
China should foster the new points of economic growth in the
sectors of residential housing and electronic information
products, while actively exploring the rural market by increasing
the output of products that are in demand among rural people in
their production and daily life, in order to promote the
development of the relevant industries, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged localities to explore new points of economic growth by
taking into consideration the country's entire economic layout and
displaying local advantages.
</P>
<P>
Only by doing so can the country's entire economic viability
be enhanced as a whole, while the phenomenon of different
regions having similar economic structures can be eliminated, he
said.
</P>
<P>
As China needs a sound economic and social environment to
fulfill the tasks set for next year, the country will try to
achieve a balance in the general economic situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The country will continue its moderately tight policies on
finance and currency to maintain continuity and stability -- but
at the same time the necessary flexibility -- in macro-economic
control policy, to maintain a reasonable growth of investment and
consumption demand, to further bring down the inflation rate and
to continue to make inflation growth slower than the economic
growth, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted, China will speed up the implementation of
the "Reemployment Program" so as to help more laid-off people find
new jobs, while efforts will be made to prevent anyone taking
advantage of monopoly or special powers to gain excessive income.
</P>
<P>
Chen added that a minimum wage system will be set up in cities.
</P>
<P>
Among those attending the meeting were leading officials in
charge of planning work in provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions, leading officials of various departments of
the central government, and representatives from key state
enterprise groups.

<HEADLINE> Unions to Strive for Equal Consultation, Collective Contracting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- An essential task for the
Chinese trade unions next year is to promote equal consultations
and collective contracting.
</P>
<P>
The focus will be on the 100 enterprises appointed by the State
Council to build a modern enterprise system, and foreign-funded
and private businesses.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed at the annual meeting of the executive
committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU),
which was held here today. ACFTU executive committee members made
it clear that all experimental enterprises should establish equal
consultation and collective contracting, try to gain experience
through practice and show themselves as examples.
</P>
<P>
Besides, more than 40 percent of the foreign-funded enterprises
which are now in operation are required to sign collective
contracts with their employees. And over 60 percent of all
employees of foreign-funded enterprises should signed such
contracts. Private and township enterprises were asked to make
breakthroughs in establishing the system.
</P>
<P>
At least half of all state or collectively-owned enterprises
which have more than 200 workers each were requested to sign
collective contracts, with at least 70 percent of all workers
benefiting from the system.
</P>
<P>
The equal consultation and collective contracting system will
help protect the legal rights and interests of the workers. By the
end of September this year, 76,000 enterprises had signed
collective contracts with their employees.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Dinghua, vice-chairman of the ACFTU, noted that the
contracts should be strictly implemented and the collective
contract should be drafted and signed in accordance with legal
procedures.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, equal consultation should be conducted
ahead of the signing and the draft contract should be submitted to
a meeting of the workers' representatives for deliberation.
</P>
<P>
The collective contract, to be signed by the trade union and
the employer, is considered as the basis for a labor contract
signed by individual workers and employers. No clause of any labor
contract is allowed to run counter to the collective contract,
said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Zhang called upon trade unions at all levels to help and
guide workers to sign contracts with the enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Law inspection this year has unveiled some problems,
such as the rising unemployment rate, stagnation of the social
insurance system, excessive overtime working, delayed payment of
salaries, infringement upon the women workers' rights and
below-standard safety and sanitary conditions.
</P>
<P>
Zhang asked trade unions to attach great importance to these
problems and strictly safeguard the workers' rights and
interests.

<HEADLINE> French President to Visit Russia in January Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 8 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
has agreed in a telephone conversation with his Russian
counterpart Boris Yeltsin on a short working visit to Russia in
January next year, the Itar-Tass News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass quoted sources of the Yeltsin press office as saying
that the two presidents had a more-than-half-hour conversation
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The two discussed a number of international issues including
European security, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe a major topic during Chirac's visit to Russia
would be the stance of France and Russia on the European security
issue.
</P>
<P>
Russia has insisted that the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) takes charge of European affairs as
an authoritative organization instead of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO). It had called on the European countries to
sign a "European security treaty" as the legal basis for the OSCE.
</P>
<P>
France, a member of both the OSCE and the NATO, has supported
the Russian idea in a certain degree, and agreed to draw such a
treaty at the OSCE summit in Lisbon, Spain, last Monday.
</P>
<P>
NATO in the past two years has been on a vigorous campaign for
an eastward expansion plan to include in central and east European
countries, to which Russia strongly opposes on the ground that it
threatens Russia's security.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Chirac, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is also
scheduled to visit Russia in January next year.

<P>
DUBAI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia became the first
team to qualify for the Asian Cup quarter finals as they edged
Iraq 1-0 in their Group B match here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Goalie Mohamed Al-Daeyea became the hero of the Saudis as he
pulled off a string of spectacular saves to keep their squad on
track to win their third Asian Cup.
</P>
<P>
Saudi striker Fahad Mahalel scored the only goal in the 26th
minute. It was a perfectly executed move, set up by Khalid Timavi,
who placed the ball to Mahalel running in from the left and the
Saudi made no mistake with his fierce shot.
</P>
<P>
But it was Al-Daeyea who saved the day in an action-packed
final 20 minutes as Iraq went all out to search for the equaliser.
</P>
<P>
But despite some brilliant goalkeeping, Iraq had a golden
chance to snatch a dramatic last gasp equaliser when Laith
Hussein shot a goal higher over.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards Iraqi coach Asad Taqi admitted that Al-Daeyea had
been the difference between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"But I think we can still get through to the quarter-finals,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's final group match on Wednesday is against Thailand.

<P>
HANGZHOU, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Mao Xingyi, a 10-year-old girl
living in this capital of east China's Zhejiang Province still
remembers her successful lawsuit against a neighbor a year ago for
accusing her of stealing and abusing her in public.
</P>
<P>
"I felt that my reputation had been damaged, so I went to the
court," Mao said.
</P>
<P>
The court finally ruled that the neighbor had violated Mao's
reputation and he was ordered to present a written apology and pay
her 300 yuan in reparation.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was the first case of reputation damage involving a
minor in Zhejiang, and it was resultant from the province's
seven-year campaign for the protection of minors' rights.
</P>
<P>
Minors should live in a healthy environment under the
protection of the school, family, community and judicial system,
an official with the provincial committee for work with minors
said today.
</P>
<P>
A law-enforcement inspection tour made by members of the
Chinese National People's Congress confirmed that the province has
taken the lead in protecting the legal rights and interests of
young people.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 11 million people under the age of 18 in
this wealthy coastal province, accounting for about a quarter of
the total population. Along with rapid economic and social
changes, the deteriorating environment for the growth of minors
has caused concern among the general public.
</P>
<P>
A campaign titled "Protect the Future" was launched in 1990 and
has since spread to all parts of the province and people of all
walks of life.

<P>
PARIS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Four days after a mysterious bomb
hit Paris metro, police in the French capital revitalized the
Vigipirate anti-terrorism action Saturday by checking 5,703 people
and 1,309 vehicles within 24 hours, Paris Police Commission said.
</P>
<P>
As the police noted, some 197 people were detained for further

year after terrorists staged a wave of attacks in the French
capital and central Lyon region, but eased for several months.
</P>
<P>
It was revived by the French government after Tuesday's
terrorist attack on a Paris underground train, in which three
people were killed and 92 wounded.

<P>
Even before the national law on protection of the rights and
interests of minors was adopted in 1990 local regulations to this
end were drawn up in the province. Based on the regulations, the
province set up a committee for the protection of minors in
1992. and local governments at all levels established similar
organizations.
</P>
<P>
To safeguard young people's right to education, the province
has pooled more than 3.6 billion yuan over the past five years to
invest in schools. Over 89 percent of school-age youngsters are
now in school.

<P>
At the same time, educational, women's and youth organizations
are running schools and classes for parents and guardians to
enhance their awareness of the law, enable them to give better
care and education to the young and prevent minors being abused or
abandoned.
</P>
<P>
In Wenzhou City alone, almost all parents and guardians have
attended such classes.
</P>
<P>
To get rid of unhealthy tendencies, Zhejiang has tightened its
control over cultural markets. Recreation halls involving gambling
are prohibited from admitting minors, and some 5,000 cases of
manufacturing, selling or spreading pornographic materials have
been cracked in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, during the same period the police in Zhejiang
Province investigated into and handled nearly 1,000 crimes and

</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political

and the overall quality of workers so as to enhance the general
mood of society.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions at various levels should guide workers to make
more contributions to realizing the trans-century goals set by the

Beijing, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Scientists worldwide still find
it extremely difficult to accept the claim by US scientists that
they have found evidence that life exists on Mars, even four
months after the stunning announcement made by NASA.
</P>
<P>
"Our planet is probably the only home to life, or at least to
intelligent life, in the universe," said Prof. Nan Rendong, deputy
director of the Beijing Observatory under the Chinese Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
In an ambitious effort to confirm its claim, early last month
NASA sent a spacecraft to Mars, which is expected to reach the
"red planet" next July.
</P>
<P>
The latest Mars probe has inspired both excitement and doubt
among Chinese scientists and amateur astronomers.
</P>
<P>
"NASA has repeatedly claimed that it has discovered evidence of
extraterrestrial life since August this year," said Prof. Nan.
</P>
<P>
"The first discovery they announced was a piece of
uncontaminated fossilized rock from Mars, in which it claimed that
it had found biological compounds," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "NASA later announced that it had discovered that
Europa, a satellite of the planet Jupiter, could contain water,
and therefore some kind of life could exist there."
</P>
<P>
"But many scientists hold that NASA has exaggerated its
findings," he said.

<HEADLINE> UN Appeals for Aid to Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has
appealed for more aid to Afghanistan where diseases and constant
threat of landmines have left the people struggling with abject
poverty.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Associated Press of Pakistan, the
United Nations wants to raise over 130 million US dollars simply
to provide basic relief for the Afghan capital of Kabul and the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted relief workers based in Kabul as saying that
the landmine problem in Afghanistan is probably the worst in the
world. There are about 10 million landmines scattered throughout
Afghanistan affecting all aspects of life in the country.
</P>
<P>
After 17 years of the armed conflict, the economy of rural
areas and the cities particularly Kabul and Kandhar has been
completely destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The relief workers said that about a quarter of million
children under five died every year from acute respiratory
infection, measles and diarrhea diseases.
</P>
<P>
Besides, about 20 percent of the children died from the
diseases which could be prevented by launching a vaccination
program.
</P>
<P>
The latest UN appeal is aimed to raise 133 million dollars for
emergency work throughout Afghanistan. The report quoted
organizers as saying that it is a minimum requirement and without
it, Afghanistan and its people will simply sink deeper into misery
and poverty.

<HEADLINE> Shopping Center in Mogadishu Catches Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Four stores of the
electricity shopping center in south Mogadish's main Bakara
market were totally destroyed when the shopping centre caught
fire this morning.
</P>
<P>
According to the owners of the business center, the fire was
ignited after a young boy carrying a hurricane lamp had stumbled
over goods and the lamp had crushed into the goods which
subsequently caught fire.
</P>
<P>
The business owners said that over 40 million Somali Shillings
(equivalent to US 5000 Dollars )in cash were burned inside the
building, while the value of destroyed raw materials of the
stores exceeded US 200,000 Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people who heard the news of the fire in Bakara
market rushed to the scene from every corner of the wartorn
capital. Many of the people had hurried to protect their goods
and shops while many others who meant to benefit from the fire
started looting as it happened when Bakara Market caught fire in
October 1995.

"For example, the so-called biological fossils from Mars, which
have a worm-shaped structure, are only one hundredth the width of
a human hair," he noted. "The structure is too minute for a
detailed chemical analysis to be made so that they can be
confirmed as biological fossils."
</P>
<P>
Explaining why people have long been fascinated by the search
for life on Mars, Nan said that the surface environment of Mars is
somewhat similar to that of the Earth, and this has inspired many
fantasies, movies and legends about the red planet.
</P>
<P>
"If we want find life within the solar system, we must first
find water," he explained." Since there is no atmosphere on the
Moon or Mercury, you cannot expect find water on their surfaces.
</P>
<P>
"Venus is too hot for water to exist for long without
evaporating, while the temperatures of the planets on the far edge
of the solar system is too low to sustain any liquid," he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the distant stars outside the solar system, he said, "It
depends on whether planets exist outside the solar system, and the
gravity and energy of the stars they center around.
</P>
<P>
"But, unfortunately, owing to the distances involved, and the
speed limit and amount of fuel a spacecraft is able to carry, man
will never be able to travel beyond the solar system," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The closest star to the earth is Gamma in the constellation
Centaurus, which is 4.27 light years from our planet (a light year
is the distance the speed of light travels in a year)," he
said. "It would take the fastest jet plane at least three million
years to reach that star."

But some leading Chinese scientists do not regard the search
for life on Mars as an absurd thing.
</P>
<P>
"Although not a few Chinese and foreign scientists are still
skeptical about the NASA's claim of finding traces of life on
Mars, I believe that it is not a complete waste of time to search
for life on Mars," said Academician Ai Guoxiang, one of the top
Chinese astronomers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"It is true that the sample NASA provided was too small, and
makes it hard to confirm whether the rock contains life or not,"
Prof. Ai said. "But since the cycle of the seasons and the surface
temperature of Mars are close to those of the earth, I think that
if scientists find water on Mars and that the atmosphere on the
planet is able to transform carbon dioxide into oxygen or
nitrogen, Mars is likely to be able to sustain human life," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Macao Charity Walk Wins Wide Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Led by a dancing parade of a
giant dragon and eight lions with a chorus of gongs, drums and
horns, more than 30,000 Macao residents took to the street today
for a charity walk to help raise fund for those in need.
</P>
<P>
The annual charity walk in Macao raised a total of 5.70 million
Patacas (about 721,500 US dollars) over the past month, winning
support from almost every corner of the city.
</P>
<P>
Lau Yiu Kwong, deputy secretary general of the Macao Daily News
Readers' Charity Fund, said the charity walk wins more and more
support because it really helps those in need.
</P>
<P>
"We have raised a total of 51.70 million Patacas (about 6.54
million US dollars) since we started the charity walk in 1984," he
told Xinhua. "The money is mainly destined to help students of
poor families, to relieve disasters, and to help those living in
poverty and difficulty."
</P>
<P>
The number of people attending the charity walk has increased
to 290,000 so far. They range from Macao Governor Vasco Rocha
Vieira, Director of Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch Wang Qiren,
and many other Portuguese and Chinese officials, to vegetable
vendors and fishermen.

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy Cautiously Upbeat About Hebron Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's envoy to the
Middle East expressed reserved optimism today over making progress
on the sticky issue of Israeli troop redeployment from Hebron in
the upcoming weeks, despite the present deadlock.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that some changes will take place during the coming
days or weeks concerning the Hebron issue despite the presence of
some obstacles now," Miguel Moratinos told reporters after meeting
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak this morning.
</P>
<P>
The European role in the Hebron negotiations is to bring
Palestinian and Israeli viewpoints closer, Moratinos said.
</P>
<P>
"I am concentrating on Europe's effective role and the attempts
to bring closer the points of view of the two sides to solve the
problem of the Hebron agreement," he noted, saying that the
Israeli settlement expansion is an obstacle to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
European and Egyptian viewpoints on the current developments
were identical, said the peace envoy of the 15-member EU on his
first tour of the region since he was appointed in August to
cement the European role in the region.
</P>
<P>
"What I want to stress once again is that Europe does exist in
the Middle East and it wants to play a complementary role to that
of the United States in the peace process," he added.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank city
of Hebron was postponed following a series of suicide bombings in
Israel in February and March.
</P>
<P>
The hardline government of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is
demanding bigger security measures for 450 Jewish settlers living
among some 200,000 Palestinians in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos, in statements following his meeting with Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa Saturday night, spoke of the
possibility of reaching a solution to the issue of Hebron over the
coming few days.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos has singled out the considerable concern over current
conditions in the Middle East, saying there is still hope.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos, who is also Spain's ambassador to Israel, is
currently making a Middle East tour which has already taken him to
Israel, Syria, the Palestinian self-rule areas and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the United States, co-sponsor of the peace process
initiated in Madrid in 1991, have been cool to an European role.
</P>
<P>
But Moratinos' appointment in August was welcomed by the
Palestinians who have been seeking a more active European role,
since the right-wing Israeli government led by Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu took office last June.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Israel Radio reported this morning
that the agreement on the redeployment of Israeli forces in Hebron
has been reached but its signing was postponed.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side wants to pin down three dates for the
implementation of the next stages of the redeployment in line
with the Oslo agreements, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
But Israel is turning down the request on the ground that it
might affect the permanent settlement agreement.

<P>
So far this year the national economy has maintained rapid
growth and inflation has been effectively curbed, according
to the minister.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the gross domestic product will grow by
around 10 percent in 1996, compared to last year, and the rise of
retail prices will be at around six percent.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that the country's grain production this
year has hit a record high, fixed-assets investment has increased
rationally, and the construction of national key projects is well
under way as planned.
</P>
<P>
The national fiscal income keeps increasing, the financial
situation remains stable, the foreign trade volume keeps growing
steadily and foreign investment continues to flow into the
country, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the country has made new progress in the
fields of science and technology, education and other social
undertakings, and consequently the living standards of both urban
and rural residents have been further improved, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen described the general principles of the planning work for

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Benefits From Rising Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Africa's number one oil
producer, Nigeria, thanks to the rising oil prices, recorded an
excess revenue of 3.493 billion U.S.Dollars in the fist six
months of this year, said the Nigerian Finance Minister.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Anthony Ani said a few days earlier that the
country's foreign currency reserve is expected to hit two billion
dollars by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have been stabilized at around 20 dollars per
barrel throughout the year, four dollars above the government
budget price for the 1996 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
despite the announcement that Iraq will resume oil exports
under the oil-for-food program of the United Nations, oil prices
continued to rise, as Nigeria's major export crude, the Bonny
light, was traded for 25.22 dollars per barrel at the london
futures market.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has
decided in a meeting two weeks ago to retain its production
ceiling of 25.033 million barrels per day for the first six
months of next year, as its Secretary-General Rilwanu Lukman
predicted that oil prices would remain stable in spite of iraq's
return to the market soon.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC's decision leaves Nigeria with an output quota of
1.865 million barrels a day for the first half of 1997.

<HEADLINE> British PM to Call for Conservative Unity on Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major is expected to use a TV interview later today to warn his
Conservative colleagues that the party's splits over its European
policy could result in losing the coming general election.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Major will tell the On the Record program
of the British Broadcasting Corp. (BBC) that Britain's "wait and
see" policy over a European single currency must not be shelved,
party sources said.
</P>
<P>
Major is quoted by the Daily Mail on Sunday as telling a
private gathering recently that it would be "mad" for the British
government to rule out the country's membership of the European
Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
Major's call for the party unity comes at a time when the
Conservative Party is in absolute chaos after Conservative MP
George Gardiner withdrew his support for the government's policy
on Europe, wiping out the Conservative one-vote majority in the
House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
The embattled Major is set to warn that if the Conservatives
continue in-fightings on the European policy, achievements of 17
years of the government could be completely ruined.
</P>
<P>
But to keep on board the "Eurosceptics" in the ruling
Conservative, Major is likely to assert that if the economic
convergence criteria laid down for the single currency are fudged,
Britain would not join the European Union single currency project.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former Conservative Party chairman Lord Tebbit is
quoted by the BBC television as calling on the prime minister to
rule out Britain's EMU membership in the first wave.
</P>
<P>
Such a formula would unite the split Conservative Party in
time for the general election, due to be held in May of next year,
he said.

DOHA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The on-going Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) summit will not discuss the request of Yemen to
join the organization, GCC Secretary General Jamil al-Hojeilan
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The 17th summit opened here Saturday and will last until
Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, GCC member states have
divergent views on Yemen's application for membership of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber
Al-Sabah had virtually ruled out agreeing to Sanaa's request,
saying the system of government in each member state is similar,
while Yemen has a republican regime. "Our regimes are different"
from Yemen's, he added.
</P>
<P>
GCC Secretary General Al-Hojeilan said the workings of
the summit are proceeding well.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1981, the GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain did not attend the summit because of its
long-standing dispute with host Qatar over the Hawar Islands and
sandbanks in the area.
</P>
<P>
The GCC secretary general said he hoped that Bahrain's
absence was temporary, as it is keen on the cohesion of the
GCC.

NEW DELHI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Deve
Gowda today called for united efforts to speed up the economic
liberalization process.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the golden jubilee celebration of the Hindi daily
Nai Duniya, the prime minister expressed concern over the slow
pace of economic reforms in the country. He said that the country
had achieved very little in terms of foreign investment since the
liberalization process started in 1991 during the Congress party
rule. There was a need for total commitment and unity irrespective
of the political affiliations in building the economy, the prime
minister added.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was wrong to blame the United Front government
for the slow progress since it had come to power only a few months
ago. Even during the stable Congress rule very little was achieved
in attracting foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
The United Front government was committed to the task of
building a stronger economy, he added.

country's exports grew by 20 percent on average from January 1992
to October 1996, the foreign exchange remittances of Filipino
overseas contracted workers surged by an average of 35 percent
each year during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Liban said the robust growth in remittances by the overseas
contracted workers has made it possible for the country to sustain
a surplus in its balance of payments despite its yawning trade
deficit of 12 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Philippines posted export sales of 9.7 billion
U.S. dollars in 1992, 11.3 billion dollars in 1993, 13.48 billion
dollars in 1994 and 17.3 billion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 months this year, the country's export sales
hit 16.8 billion dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the overseas contracted workers remitted through banks
2.2 billion dollars in 1992, 2.37 billion dollars in 1993, 3
billion dollars in 1994 and 4.9 billion dollars in 1995, Liban
said.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months this year, he said, the total
remittances hit 3.48 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
A study made by the International Labor Organization said the
country's 4.2 million overseas contracted workers are earning an
estimated 18 billion dollars to 20 billion dollars each year.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Central Bank estimated that the remittances by
Filipinos overseas contracted workers could reach a record seven
billion dollars this year.

<HEADLINE> Hu Jintao Meets Bolivian Guests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) - Hu Jintao, a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee, met here today with Guillermo
Bedregal, first vice-chairman of the Bolivian Nationalist
Revolutionary Movement (MNRB).
</P>
<P>
During the meeting in the Great Hall of the People, Hu, who is
also a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee,
extended a warm welcome to Bedregal and his wife.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that Sino-Bolivian relations have been developing
smoothly since the two countries established diplomatic ties in
1985.
</P>
<P>
Praising the MNRB for its "important contributions" to the
forging of diplomatic relations, Hu said that cooperation between
the two countries in all fields made headway when the MNRB was in
power.
</P>
<P>
"The CPC is willing to strengthen and develop friendly and
cooperative ties with the MNRB," Hu said, hoping that both sides
would unite their efforts to push Sino-Bolivian relations to a
higher stage.
</P>
<P>
Bedregal said that he cherished fond memories of China and that
he was very happy to be invited by the CPC to visit China again.
</P>
<P>
He said China is in the process of reform under the leadership
of the CPC, and its rapid economic accomplishments are remarkable
and give great inspiration to the Bolivian people.
</P>
<P>
"We can learn from China's experiences to promote the growth of
our national economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting were Li Shuzheng, head of the
International Department of the CPC Central Committee, and
Bolivian Ambassador to China Mario Reyes Charez.
</P>
<P>
The Bedregals arrived here Saturday. Their visit will also take
them to Xi'an, Hangzhou and Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Rugby Union, Snooker added to 1998 Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Rugby union and snooker were
added to the 1998 Asian Games schedule on Sunday, with squash and
an Indian sport of kabaddi contesting for the final berths.
</P>
<P>
The additions bring the number of sports on the programme to
34, but the Bangkok Organising Committee expressed confidence it
could handle the workload in a city notorious for traffic jams
and air pollution, according to a press report.
</P>
<P>
The executive board of the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA)
included rugby union and snooker but rejected their sports
committee's recommendation that both squash and kabaddi be on the
roster.
</P>
<P>
OCA president Sheikh Ahmad Al Sabah of Kuwait was to meet
representatives of South Asia, where the sports are most popular,
to settle the final place. A decision is to be announced at the
OCA General Assembly meeting here Monday
</P>
<P>
Kabaddi, a form of tag played by only a handful of countries,
was originally included by the sports committe because of a
desire to involve some truly Asian sports and ensure medals were
distributed more evenly.
</P>
<P>
Squash has been lobbying for a place for several years and had
looked likely to miss out again because of a shortage of
facilities in Bangkok. A final plea by squash officials won over
the sports committee before the executive board put its
participation in doubt again.
</P>
<P>
"We have given priority to Olympic sports but wanted to include
 non-Olympic sports played in Asia in order to promote them and to
ensure a large distribution of medals among developing countries,
Wei Jizhong, chairman of the OCA sports committee said.
</P>
<P>
Wei, also secretary general of the Chinese Olympic Committee,
had pushed for the inclusion of rugby which is growing in
popularity in China.
</P>
<P>
Thailand was keen to have snooker included in the Bangkok Games
because of its following here. The country's most famous sporting
son is James Wattana who lead Thailand to a last-four spot in the
recent snooker World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Olympic sports to be held at the Games are archery, athletics,
badminton, baseball, basketball, boxing, canoeing, cycling,
equestrian, fencing, football, gymnastics, handball, hockey,
judo, rowing, shooting, softball, swimming, table tennis,
taekwondo, tennis, volleyball, weightlifting, wrestling and
yachting.
</P>
<P>
The non-Olympic sports are sepak takraw, wushu, karate do,
golf, rugby union, bowls, snooker and soft tennis.
</P>
<P>
The events to be held for each of the 34 sports will be decided
later by the OCA sports committee. Swimming will include diving
while it is still to be decided if rugby will be seven-a-side,
15-a-side or both.

<HEADLINE> EAC States Call for Easy Border Movement of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The six meeting of the
Permanent Tripartite Commission for East African Co-operation
(EAC) has stressed the need to speed up the smooth movement of
of people and goods among the three EAC states.
</P>
<P>
The Tripartite Commission meeting, ended last Friday in Arusha
in northern Tanzania, urged a reduction of formalities at border
posts in a bid to ease the movement of people, goods and other
services among the EAC member states, said a report reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
A press release, issued at the end of the one-day commission
meeting, said that while police road blocks, or checks on
designated routes - except those established for temporary
security meassures - are expected to be removed by January 1997,
the commission has given March as the deadline for the reduction
of border crossing formalities.
</P>
<P>
The Meeting directed the member states to forward to the EAC
Secretariat by the end of January 1997, their comments on a
development strategy paper that articulates the mechanisms for
the regional economic, social and political integration for the
1997-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
The paper will be presented to the tripartite commission at
its 7th session in April next year before being discussed at the
summit of the three heads of state, for implementation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting that recorded the highest attendance of 127
delegates, including 13 ministers from the region, directed the
Secretariat to study modalities for the admission of other
countries into, or their association with the EAC.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Adjustment of Economic Structure (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- China will strengthen the
adjustment over its economic structure in 1997 to promote the
transfer of economic mechanism and the mode of economic growth, a
senior economic official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Increasing the efforts to adjust the economic structure will
lay an important foundation for maintaining the macro-economic
stability and upgrading the quality of the national economy, said
Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
"It will serve as an essential guarantee for raising the
competitiveness of the Chinese economy in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
And it is crucial for solving the difficulties faced by
state-owned enterprises, as well as for the effective guidance of
micro-economic activities by means of macro-level controls, Chen
added.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a national planning conference which
ended here today.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference was held to discuss the 1997 plan for
national economic and social development. Vice-Premier Zou
Jiahua made a speech at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jinhua said in his work report that China has realized its
goals of macro-level control quite well in 1996, fulfilled the
main tasks of national economic and social development, and made an
excellent start for the accomplishment of the five-year national
economic and social development plan extending to the year 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A total of 920,000 people in
south China's Hainan Province have shaken off poverty in the past
six years, thanks to efforts local governments have made in
helping poverty-hit areas develop economy by making use of their
tropical resources.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1995 period, the province established 82
help-the-poor production bases and planted 21,000 hectares of
various cash crops.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, a total of 600 million yuan were
used in construction of water and electricity supply facilities
and roads in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has invested 80 million yuan in
building new houses with a total floor space of 5.45 million
square meters for residents of ethnic minority groups, with
390,000 of them having said good-bye to thatched houses they have
lived in for generations.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that from 1991 to 1995, four out of nine
counties designated by the state and 26 out of 136 towns
designated by the provincial government have overcome poverty.
</P>
<P>
There will be three more counties and 63 townships shaking off
poverty by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Benetton Threaten Boycott over Senna Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Flavio Briatore has warned that
his Benetton team will boycott Italian Formula One races if anyone
is convicted in the wake of Ayrton Senna's death at Imola in 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to a press report, Briatore's threat comes two weeks
after a report that a public prosecutor here is preparing a
manslaughter case against three members of Senna's Williams team
and three race officials.
</P>
<P>
The Italian team chief, speaking at the Bologna Motor Show,
said: "If someone were to be convicted in Italy for the death of
Ayrton Senna there would be big trouble.
</P>
<P>
"I, for one, would not risk bringing my team to a country where
you could be convicted for an accident. We have to accept the
element of risk that Formula One shares with a sport like boxing."
</P>
<P>
Manslaughter charges are reportedly being prepared against team
boss Frank Williams, technical director Patrick Head and a third
member of the team, believed to be chief designer Adrian Newey.
</P>
<P>
Senna died from head injuries after crashing at the San Marino
Grand Prix on May 1, and speculation has focussed on the
Brazilian's steering column which allegedly snapped just before
the crash.
</P>
<P>
The manslaughter charges will also reportedly implicate the two
senior circuit officials, Federico Bendinelli and Giorgio Poggi,
and Belgian race director Roland Bruynseraede.

<HEADLINE> Seven Nepali Ministers Withdraw From Ruling Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Seven Nepali cabinet members
today submitted their resignation to Prime Minister Sher Bahadur
Deuba, showing their support for a proposed no-confidence motion
against the coalition government led by the Nepali Congress (NC)
party.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, all from the ruling partner the National
Democratic Party (RPP), handed over their resignation to the
prime minister earlier today, sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, RPP parliamentary leader Lokendra Bahadur Chand
today submitted a memorandum signed by 102 MPs to King Birendra,
asking him to call a special session of the lower house to discuss
the no-confidence motion against the government.
</P>
<P>
Under the Constitution of Nepal, a special house session could
be called by the king if demanded by a two-third majority of the
205-seat lower house.
</P>
<P>
Rumors here said earlier Chand would be the prime minister if a
new coalition government is formed between RPP and the main
opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist,
CPN-UML).
</P>
<P>
A similar no-confidence motion tabled by the CPN-UML last March
failed at the last minute as some MPs from the RPP party chose to
stay in the coalition before the voting in the house.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> AFC Chief Slams FIFA Boss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Sultan Ahmed Shad, President
of the Asian Football Confederation criticised FIFA's President
Joao Havelange on Saturday for his comments on the co-hosting of
the 2002 World Cup by Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by the AFC during the Asian Cup finals
here in Abu Dhabi, Havelange said that it was because of
political reasons that South Korea and Japan were jointly awarded
the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Both these Asian economic giants were earlier at loggerheads
over which country was to host the opening ceremony and final but
the issue appears to be resolved now with Japan hosting the final
and South Korea the opening match.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Havelange's statement in Zurich Friday, Shah
said that "Havlange's comments are disappointing as far as the
AFC is concerned."
</P>
<P>
He said it must be reiterated that the decision to allow Japan
and South Korea to co-host the 2002 World Cup was not made because
of political reasons as alleged by Havelange.
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, the decision is extremely sound as it has
helped elevate the World Cup to new heights of interest and
excitement while enhancing further FIFA's image."
</P>
<P>
He said Asia fully supports co-hosting the 2002 World Cup by
Japan and South Korea as the idea came from the AFC.
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledged that there will be problems in organising
such an event but pointed out that FIFA and AFC have the
"capacity to overcome any problems which may arise."

<HEADLINE> Tamura Wins 7th Straight Fukuoka Judo Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Japanese judo world champion
Ryoko Tamura took her seventh straight bantamweight title at the
Fukuoka women's judo tournament on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It was her first appearance since the upset defeat suffered at
the Atlanta Olympics by unknown Kye Sun of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea in the women's 48-kilogram category.
</P>
<P>
Tamura, 21, two-time world champion, returned to her winnings
ways here Sunday, scoring an ippon in her first two bouts and
narrowly beating China's Li Aiyue by a split decision. She
defeated Atlanta bronze medallist Amarilis Savon of Cuba in the
final by a yuko.
</P>
<P>
Hosts Japan, who failed to win a title Saturday, saved some
face by winning three titles Sunday with Hideko Sugimura in the
lightweight class and Kazue Nagai in the featherweight division
joining Tamura on the winners' list.
</P>
<P>
Sugimura scored a koka by pushing Park Mi-Hee down, which hurt
the South Korean's right knee, and kept the lead to win her first
victory in the 56kg class here.
</P>
<P>
Nagai avenged her Olympic qualifying match loss to fellow
Japanese and eventual Atlanta bronze medallist Noriko Sugawara,
by beating her with a split decision in the 52kg final.
</P>
<P>
In an all-Chinese final, Olympic champion Sun Fuming, who lost
to Yuan Hua in the over 72kg final Saturday, immobilized the same
rival 2:10 into the open category decider.
</P>
<P>
Other titles Saturday were taken away by South Koreans Chung
Sung-Sook and Cho Min-Sun in the light-middleweight and
middleweight divisions, and Ulla Werbrouck of Belgium in the
light-heavyweight sections.

<HEADLINE> Japan Intends to Curb Growth in Defense, ODA Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Japan attempts to keep the rise
of expenditure on defense and official development assistance
(ODA) within some 1 percent in fiscal 1997 to curb the inflated
budget deficit, Kyodo reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Ministry of Finance will start talks next week
with the Defense Agency over this matter, Kyodo quoted the
newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Agency, which was allowed a 2.58 percent rise in
its expenditure in fiscal 1996, has demanded a 2.88 percent
increase in its spending over the fiscal 1996 level of 4.85
trillion yen (43.7 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Foreign Ministry has said that the fiscal 1997 ODA
budget has to grow by at least 2.6 percent in order to attain
Japan's pledge to spend 70-75 billion dollars on the ODA over a
period of five years through fiscal 1997.
</P>
<P>
The overall fiscal 1997 national budget will grow between 3
percent and 4 percent to 77-78 trillion yen (694-703 billion
dollars) despite an increase of some 6 trillion yen (54 billion
dollars) in tax revenue due to a planned hike of 2 percentage
points in consumption tax, Kyodo quoted the business daily Nihon
Keizai Shimbun as saying.
</P>
<P>
Half of the revenue increase will go to debt-servicing and tax
grants to local governments, said Kyodo.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Air-traffic Controllers Stage Go-slow Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Go-slow action taken by Kenyan
air-traffic controllers is seriously affecting aviation
operations in Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu and Malindi, leading to
delays in departures and arrivals of the internatioanl and
demostic flights.
</P>
<P>
The air controllers are demanding, among other things, setting
up an autonomous civil aviation body and an increase in their
wages. The monthly minimun pay of the controllers is at 7200
Kenyan Shillings at present.
</P>
<P>
The go-slow action which started yesterday is expected to
worsen as the controllers have vowed to totally paralyze
operations throughout the country unless their demands are met.
</P>
<P>
The today's Sunday Nation said that in Nairobi, departures and
arrivals of International and domestic flights were delayed for
more than three hours.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 tourists connecting local and international
flights were stranded at the Moi International Airport in
Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
in Kisumu, a Kenya airways plane was held up for 30 minutes
before landing.
</P>
<P>
The departure and arrival terminals at the Jomo Kenyatta
International Airport were jammed with travellers and other
people waiting to receive arriving passengers.
</P>
<P>
One controller was quoted as saying that their action was
supported by the aeronautical communications engineers and
information officers.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's 117 air-traffic controllers have reportedly all
supported the go-slow action.
</P>
<P>
The Jomo Kenyatta Airport in Nairobi handles between 35 and 40
flights with more than 14,000 passengers every day.

<HEADLINE> Qatari FM Optimistic About GCC Summit's Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DOHA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh
Hamad Ben Jassem Bin Jaber al Thani today expressed optimism
over the success of the 17th summit of the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC), which is now under way here.
</P>
<P>
"The outcome of the GCC summit will be good and positive," he
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1981, the GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain did not attended the three-day summit, which opened
here Saturday, because of its long-standing dispute with host
Qatar over the Hawar Islands and sandbanks in the area.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain's refusal to participate in the gathering is the
first boycott since the founding of the GCC.
</P>
<P>
Qatari foreign minister said that the absence of Bahrain would
not affect the work of the summit.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that efforts were being made to persuade
Bahrain to attend the gathering, but they failed.
</P>
<P>
Asked about attempts to persuade Bahrain to attend the closing
session of the summit, Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad said: "If
there were such attempts, there are no objections....But I believe
the issue has been settled by our brothers in Bahrain through
their statements."
</P>
<P>
Bahrain has recently arrested two Qatari nationals on charges
of spying for Qatar. Qatar has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
Today's local newspapers gave spotlight to the GCC summit
opening session.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily Peninsula carried a story on its
front page, with the banner headline "Emir opens Doha summit
with call for an end to protectionism," stressing the need for
GCC states to liberalize their economies.
</P>
<P>
Another English-language daily, Gulf Times, carried a
front-page story with the banner headline "Emir urges closer
economic ties."

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times:
</P>
<P>
-- British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke was under
intense pressure Saturday night from cabinet colleagues to back
down in the Tory civil war on Europe. Ministers were urging him to
accept a face-saving formula on the single currency that they hope
will turn the party back from self-destruction and electoral
disaster.
</P>
<P>
The Observer:
</P>
<P>
-- More than 100,000 families in Britain have been blown apart
by psychoanalysts who have falsely convinced clients they were
sexually abused in childhood. The claim, made in a book to be
published in January, will fuel the bitter dispute between those
who believe that adults suppress painful childhood memories and
others who allege therapy destroys innocent lives.
</P>
<P>
Independent On Sunday:
</P>
<P>
-- Entrance charges at the British Museum look inevitable but
will not be introduced at present, its board of trustees agreed
Saturday. The board rejected a suggested five-pound fee, which
would have raised 8 million pounds (about 13 million U.S. dollars)
a year.
</P>
<P>
The Mail On Sunday:
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister John Major came under renewed fire
over Europe Saturday night when it emerged that he had told a
private lunch 10 days ago that it would be mad to rule out joining
the single currency.

<HEADLINE> Hot Spring Discovered in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese geologists have
discovered the "Medicine King Spring" that mysteriously
disappeared during an earthquake 60 years ago in the northwestern
Gansu Corridor.
</P>
<P>
The hot spring, rich in fluorine, lithium and other minerals,
has healthful qualities, "China Geology and Mineral Resources
News" has reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the spring is also of great significance to the
dry Gansu Corridor, about 1,000-kilometer long.
</P>
<P>
The spring's source is an oval-shaped hot water belt
underground, about 500 meters long and 100-200 meters wide. It is
located 44 km outside the city of Wuwei and is adjacent to the 312
national highway.
</P>
<P>
With a temperature of 55 degrees centigrade, and a daily usable
volume of 750 cubic meters of water, the spring has a great deal
of potential to tap into, geologists said.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Hold Talks With Polish PM on Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
held talks this morning with Polish Prime Minister Wlodzimierz
Cimoszewicz on the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Polish prime minister, who arrived here Saturday
afternoon on a four-day visit to Egypt, will also meet with his
Egyptian counterpart Kamal El-Ganzouri later today.
</P>
<P>
They will discuss ways of increasing economic cooperation and
trade volume and reducing trade gap. Their talks will also cover
Poland's stance towards the Middle East peace process, according
to the Egyptian Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers will sign an agreement on ending double
taxation.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries totaled 66 million
U.S. dollars last year. Poland mainly exported steel and chemical
products to Egypt and imported Egyptian fruits.
</P>
<P>
Joint ventures and the general frame of cooperation will also
be on top of the agenda of the bilateral talks, said Ganzouri when
meeting Cimoszewicz upon his arrival.
</P>
<P>
He added that he will review with Cimoszewicz the economic
reform policies in both countries and the progress they have made
through different approaches.
</P>
<P>
The trade turnover between Poland and the Arab world accounts
for only 1 percent of its foreign trade, he noted.
</P>
<P>
It is the first visit to Egypt by a Polish prime minister in
10 years.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Cimoszewicz will also meet with Speaker
of the People's Assembly Ahmed Fathi Sorour, Chairman of the
Shura Council Moustafa Kamal Helmi and some Egyptian businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The Polish prime minister is accompanied by his ministers of health,
industry and trade, deputy ministers of foreign affairs, culture
and economic relations along with some businessmen.

<HEADLINE> New Chili Pepper Drug Made in Israel to Ease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A new drug made from
chili peppers has been developed in Israel to effectively
relieve chronic pains.
</P>
<P>
The skin ointment Zostrix and the more concentrated form
Zostrix HP are produced by Jerusalem's Rafa Laboratories in
cooperation with the U.S. pharmaceutical company Genderm.
</P>
<P>
They have just been registered by the Health Ministry as
over-the-counter medications in Israel. Before this, the drug had
been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and put on
 sale in the U.S., Canada and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Capsaicin, the active ingredient found in the red hot
peppers and other capsicum plants, is the basis of the new
drug. Scientists have long before discovered the effectiveness
of capsaicin in relieving pains caused by chronic illnesses.
</P>
<P>
In producing the Zostrix drug, the capsaicin undergoes a
1,000-fold purification process, turning itself into a white
crystalline substance. This gives the drug a powerful effect,
causing the depletion of substance P from sensory neurons that
transmit pain.
</P>
<P>
Zostrix drug is not for all types of pain, but designated
for a number of specific problems. The less-concentrated Zostrix
is highly effective for relieving pain and joint tenderness in
osteoarthritis patients and those with rheumatoid arthritis of
the knee.
</P>
<P>
The more concentrated Zostrix HP is meant for diabetes
with pain resulting from neuropathy. Clinical trials found that
patients using the drug enjoyed a notable improvement in their
ability to perform routine daily activities.
</P>
<P>
Patients with open wounds or broken skin cannot use this
drug because it causes burning sensation. One should also
avoid getting it into the eyes and mouth.

<HEADLINE> China Gives One Month's Grace to Banning Some US Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to extend the
deadline one month to temporarily suspend the imports of some
products from the United States, a spokesman for the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (Moftec) said here today.
</P>
<P>
An announcement jointly issued on November 10 by the Moftec and
the General Administration of Customs said that China would
temporarily suspend the imports of some textiles, agricultural and
animal husbandry products, fruits, alcoholic drinks and beverages
from the United States from December 10, in response to the US
unilateral cut of import quotas of Chinese textiles.
</P>
<P>
The Moftec spokesman said that delegations from China and the
US met in Beijing December 2-5 to continue negotiations on
textiles.
</P>
<P>
During the negotiations, the spokesman said, the two
delegations exchanged views on a broad range of issues on textile
transshipment and quota cut as well as on a new bilateral textile
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The current Sino-US textile agreement, signed in 1994 and the
fourth of its kind, is scheduled to expire on December 31.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the consultations are positive and
the two delegations agreed to have another round of consultations
later this month.
</P>
<P>
He said that due to the fact that the consultations are to be
continued and the US delegation has promised to re-study the quota
cut cases, China decided to give a month's grace to the
implementation of the suspension on importing some US products.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said, "China always holds that trade disputes
should be settled through consultations on an equal footing. China
expects to have that kind of consultations on the issues concerned
and reach an agreement with the US side at an early date."

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldier Killed in S. Lebanon Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 8 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli soldier was
killed and another wounded Saturday in the Israeli self-claimed
south Lebanon security zone by a roadside bomb planted by
Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing exchanges of fire, six Lebanese civilians
were wounded in Tibnit village in the eastern sector of the
zone.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred before 3:00 p.m. Saturday afternoon when
the Hezbollah detonated the bomb near an Israeli patrol squad
and killed Mohammed Hujeirat, a 28-year-old Beduin tracker,
and moderately wounded another soldier. Hezbollah fighters also
opened long-range anti-tank fire at the patrol squad in the
attack.
</P>
<P>
Israeli tanks, artillery and helicopter gunships immediately
retaliated with heavy shelling on the Tibnit village, wounding
six villagers.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah issued a statement claiming responsibility for the
attack, but it maintained that it was deep in the zone and
there was no excuse for Israel's shelling of Tibnit.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Radio stations said that Lebanon would call for a
meeting of the south Lebanon cease-fire monitoring committee to
investigate Israel's shelling of the civilians.
</P>
<P>
The committee, formed after Israel's Operation Grapes of Wrath
in April, composed of representatives from the U.S., France,
Israel, Syria and Lebanon. The committee is expected to meet
Tuesday in Nakoura inside the zone.
</P>
<P>
The committee has held several meetings since April to hear
complaints by Israel and Lebanon over breaches of the
understandings which banned attacks on civilians on either side.
</P>
<P>
Hujeirat was the 25th Israeli soldier that has been killed
by Hezbollah in south Lebanon so far this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A total of 200,000 have died of
Aids in Malawi since the first case was offically diagonized in
1985, according Sunday Times of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the Malawian National Aids Control
Program as estimating that about one million of the country's
population of 11 million are Hiv positive.
</P>
<P>
Despite the prevailing public awarness of the disease, few
people have come out in the open to talk about it, the newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Most of those infected fear the public will shun them if they
disclose their condition, it said.
</P>
<P>
Scores of Hiv testing and counselling centres have sprung up
in Malawi run either by the government, church or other
non-government institutions, it reported.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 Aids support groups have been set up with the
support from local and international donor agencies. The support
groups help aids victims both psychologically and materially,
encouraging them to adopt a more postive attidute towards life.
</P>
<P>
A consultative mission from the United Nations volunteers
visited Malawi last month to work out an effective public
campaign strategy to involve people infected with Hiv in Aids
prevention, care and support, according to the paper. enditem

Major-General Joe Garba has been put in a list of nine names proposed

</P>
<P>
The Security Council, however, will not consider Garba's candidacy

any memeber state, in accordance with the guidelines for the selection
process, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear at present whether the Nigerian government will
intend to back the candidature of Garba, who was once Nigeria's

<HEADLINE> Record 10 Million Dollars Raised for Youth in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi yesterday raised a record of 578 million Kenyan Shillings (10
million U.S. Dollars) for the National Youth Development Program
(NYDP) in a fund-raising event here, local newspapers reported
today.
</P>
<P>
President Moi gave a personal donation of about 2,67 million
Shillings and brought in 93.2 million Shillings collected from
private individuals and concerns.
</P>
<P>
The Party of Independent Candidates of Kenya, the only
opposition party joining in the event, also contributed 2.5
million Shillings to the program.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the function, Moi said that as Kenya prepares to
enter the next century, unemployment and poverty pose the most
serious challenges to the Kenyan people, especially the youth.
</P>
<P>
The NYDP is aimed at giving the youth access to credit with
which they may set up income-generating enterprises, thus
harnessing their creative energies as an asset for social and
economic development, the Kenyan leader said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a secretariat to oversee the implementation,
management and overall co-ordination of the program had been
established at the Office of the President.
</P>
<P>
President Moi disclosed that his government was planning to
establish a National Youth Development Bank to enhance the
sustainability of the program.
</P>
<P>
The amounts raised at the sub-locational, locational,
divisional and district levels will be returned to these
administrative units while additional funds raised yesterday
will be distributed equally throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the function, President Moi suspended all
fund-raising activities throughout the east African country with
effect from tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The previous record for a national fund-raising Harambee stood
at 141 million Shillings raised on March 17, 1990, for the
National School Bursary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Next year President Moi will preside over another Harambee for
women in the country.
</P>
<P>
Harambee initiated by Kenya's founding father Jomo Kenyatta in
1963 is the way to raise money to aid communities, stricken
families and even individuals.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 33 years, billions of Shillings have been raised
through harambee to build schools, dispensaries, roads, social
halls, etc.

<P>
HARARE, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Managing Director of the national
airline, Air Zimbabwe, Huttush Muringi has been dismissed, the daily
Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
His dismissal was announced yesterday by the corporation's
Chairman David Zamchiya. Muringi was sent on leave in May
indefinitely to facilitate investigations into various allegations
made against him.
</P>
<P>
The allegations centred around purchases of property,
including a house with 180,000 US Dollars and a car with 100,000
US Dollars as well as his management style, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Muringi has headed the national airline since 1993. Following a
number of allegations, some of which were made public through
parliamentary debates, the Air Zimbabwe Board launched its own
investigations, the findings of which were presented to Muringi in a
formal hearing.
</P>
<P>
Zamchiya said the board is aware that many suitably qualified
Zimbabweans and foreigners from friendly countries and airlines could
fill the position.
</P>
<P>
The board, he said, was determined to tackle the problems which
had been bedevilling the airline, causing inconvenience to the
travelling public through unreliable operations. enditem

<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition Vows to Topple Ruling Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior leader of Nepal's
main opposition party has said his party was determined to topple
the ruling coalition by joining hands with a junior ruling partner
in the government, press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Madhav Kumar Nepal, general secretary of the Communist Party of
Nepal (United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML) reportedly told a
gathering of party workers Saturday that it was time to bring down
the three-party coalition government led by the Nepali Congress
(NC) party.
</P>
<P>
He accused the government of being involved in massive
corruption and unable to maintain law and order in the country.
</P>
<P>
He also said a new coalition between CPN-UML and the National
Democratic Party (RPP), a partner in the present ruling coalition,
was necessary to rule the country.
</P>
<P>
The RPP joined the NC-led coalition in September last year
after they jointly overthrew the CPN-UML minority government
through a no-confidence motion with support from another small
party.
</P>
<P>
With its 19 seats in the 205-member lower house, the RPP holds
the key to any political equation in the country as the CPN-UML
and NC have 86 and 89 respectively, both of which are short of the
103 seats necessary to form a government with majority
parliamentary support.
</P>
<P>
It was rumored here that the main opposition CPN-UML party has
garnered the support of some 100 MPs in the lower house for a
proposed no-confidence motion against the government.
</P>
<P>
Those backing the motion include RPP parliamentary leader
Lokendra Bahadur Chand and his supporters in the party.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said Chand would be the prime minister if a new
coalition government is formed by the CPN-UML and RPP.
</P>
<P>
A similar CPN-UML-tabled no-confidence motion against the
present coalition government led by NC's Sher Bahadur Deuba
failed last March as some RPP MPs chose to support the coalition
at the last minute.

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Discrimination Against Indian Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Women working as farm labor
in rural India get just 70 percent of the wage earned by men doing
the same job, according to a latest study.
</P>
<P>
What is worse, however efficient she may be, she gets just 124
days' work in the whole year as against the 145 days for a man in
the agricultural sector. In non-agricultural sectors, where the
daily wages are higher, a woman gets 133 days of work as against
157 days for men.
</P>
<P>
The story of the rural Indian woman is one of discrimination
and disparities. Whether in access to education, nutrition, wage
rates or health care, she continues to be a second-class citizen.
Culturally India is still a patriarchal society and 50 years after
independence, gender disparities persist, the study said.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 33,000 rural households in 16 states in the
country showed that 12 percent of the girls in the 0 to 12 age
group are missing. This is either because of under-reporting or
female infanticide.
</P>
<P>
In a country where 37 percent of the rural population is
landless, wage work is an important source of livelihood. But as
against 83 percent of the male adults who find employment, just 30
to 42 percent of women find work.
</P>
<P>
Tremendous gaps exist in the literacy rates and the school
enrollment ratio between girls and boys. With a slow but sure
trend to the privatization of education in rural India, women may
lose that one opportunity to come out of their entombment, the
study said.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia on
Saturday forced a U.N.-chartered plane to land at the Shindand
airbase in Herat Province, western Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports today, the aircraft, with
Tajik opposition leader Abdullah Noori and eight Iranian officials
on board, was traveling between the Iranian city of Mashhad in
Khorassan Province bordering Afghanistan and the northwestern
Afghan town of Kunduz.
</P>
<P>
Deputy head of the U.N. mission for Afghanistan Francis Okello
confirmed that the plane belonged to the United Nations. "It is a
U.N. plane and was on international flight," he was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Taliban sources in Peshawar, capital of Pakistan's North West
Frontier Province, also confirmed the report and said the plane
was forced to land, for it had not received any prior permission
for flying over Herat.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban sources did not mention how many people
were on board. The plane, along with the passengers, would
reportedly be allowed to continue their journey to Kunduz soon.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Meteorological
Department has warned that cold weather is expected to strike the
northern and northeastern regions in the country in the coming
week.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures in both regions are likely to drop another two to
four degrees Celsius due to a strong high-pressure front which has
reached the upper part of Thailand, the department said.
</P>
<P>
Mountain dwellers can expect a real cold snap, with a five- to
six-degree drop in the temperature, the department said.
</P>
<P>
The minimum temperature in some mountain areas in the regions
currently is forecast at five to 10 degrees Celsius in the coming
days, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures below eight degrees Celsius is considered
extremely cold in Thailand. Deaths were reported in some remote
mountain areas in the tropical country in the past years when the
temperature dropped below eight degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
The department urged people to take necessary precautions to
avoid catching cold and cautioned motorists to take extra care due
to fog in the morning.

<HEADLINE> Japan Plans National Mobile Phone Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese Posts and
Telecommunications Ministry plans to team up with the private
sector to develop a nationwide mobile phone network using
stationary airships as radio relay stations, the Kyodo news agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan which the ministry hopes to put into use in
2002, about 20 airships will be floated across the Japanese
archipelago at a height of 20 kilometers, about twice as high as
routes flown by jetliners, Kyodo quoted the national news daily,
Asahi Shimbun, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The airships, containing telecommunication equipment, will be
kept stationary with the aid of propellers.
</P>
<P>
One airship can cover a ground communication area of some 100
kilometers in radius, and will enable the use of
Japanese-developed personal handy-phone system (PHS) units within
a 35-kilometer radius of the area directly below.
</P>
<P>
The method will also permit mobile phone communication in areas
without ground relay terminals such as mountainous regions, where
it is currently impossible to use conventional cellular and PHS
phones.

<HEADLINE> Two Filipino Overseas Workers Return in Coffin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Everyday, at least two Filipino
overseas contract workers return to the Philippines in coffin, the
Manila Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper, quoting statistics from the Overseas Workers Welfare
Administration (OWWA), said more than 700 Filipino overseas
workers lost their lives every year and there are more if
undocumented workers who suffer the same fate are included.
</P>
<P>
According to the OWWA statistics, some 2,000 Filipino workers
leave for overseas employment everyday, with women making up more
than half of the number.
</P>
<P>
They are hailed as "national heroes" in their motherland since
they earn millions in much-needed foreign currencies for their
country every year. It is estimated that this year their earnings
would reach 7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, numerous studies have pointed out that overseas
workers, especially women workers, are the most vulnerable to
abuse, the paper said. It added that they are made to endure long
work hours, lack of sleep, no holidays or days off, non-payment of
wages, insufficient food and verbal, physical or sexual abuses.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Philippine government once severed diplomatic
relations with Singapore over the case of Filipino housemaid Flor
Contemplacion who was charged with murdering another Filipino maid
and a four-year-old Singapore boy and was to be hanged.
</P>
<P>
With the government's efforts, Sarah Balabagan, 17, escaped
death and returned home last August after serving a one-year jail
term for killing an 80-year-old Saudi employer who raped her.
</P>
<P>
The hard experiences of Filipino overseas contract workers
aroused general concern in the Philippines, but it is worth
noticing that, as some Philippine newspapers reported, their
plight was not always the fault of their employers.

<HEADLINE> Manila Sees Huge Aid in Tokyo Donors' Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines expects to raise
2.5 billion U.S. dollars in fresh official development assistance
(ODA) when its major creditors and donors meet in Tokyo on
December 10, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed as a Consultative Group (CG) meeting, the Tokyo
gathering will tackle the Philippine request for fresh financing
for its Social Reform Agenda, a program aimed at improving the
country's infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo was quoted as saying the
Philippines would generate as much as 2.55 billion dollars in
financial assistance for various priority development projects
thanks to the country's good economic performance this year.
</P>
<P>
De Ocampo said the country has successfully contained its
inflation rate to a single-digit level despite a series of oil
price increases in recent months and would enjoy a budgetary
surplus in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He said Japan is expected to contribute the biggest share of
1.4 billion dollars. The World Bank, which has pledged 500 million
dollars a year in financial aid to the Philippines over the next
five years, will also chip in 500 million dollars and the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) is projected to pledge an additional 400
million dollars. Other bilateral agencies will make up the balance
of 200 million to 250 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Consultative Group for the Philippines was an offshoot of
the U.S.-initiated Philippine Assistance Program known then as the
Multilateral Assistance Initiative, a package of financial
assistance to facilitate the country's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Chaired by the World Bank, the group is composed of other
multilateral agencies such as the ADB and bilateral agencies like
the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The yearly meeting also serves as a forum for donor agencies to
pledge financial support for the country's priority development
projects.
</P>
<P>
According to de Ocampo, this year's CG meeting, the sixth since
it was initiated in 1989, will have four sessions.

<HEADLINE> India-Based Drug MNCs to Be Created: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- In its latest research
report, global investment bank Lehman Brothers has forecast the
creation of pharmaceutical multinational companies (MNCs) that
will be based in India for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The report also analyzed three companies that it expects to be
long-term success stories in India - Ranbaxy, Dr. Reddy's
Laboratories and Wockhardt.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the pharmaceutical industry in India
is on the threshold of a major restructuring and is poised to
exploit the opportunities in both the domestic and international
markets. Policy changes and the government's gradual easing of
controls -- accepting product patents and monitoring quality and
granting price freedom -- all signal better times for the
industry.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a few Indian pharmaceutical companies should make
the transition from being specialized bulk intermediary
manufacturers to multinational companies over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
A better regulatory environment will force inefficient players
out and it is expected that there will be a spate of mergers,
acquisitions and takeovers as capacity is realigned and the
industry consolidates. Growth in pharmaceutical sales for the next
five years will be driven by the increased sales of essential
drugs, particularly antibiotics, in their generic versions and by
the export of bulk drugs, the report said.

With the Festival still two months to go, the country's
transportation sector and public security departments have already
started to overwork to ensure safe family reunion of the country's
colossal amount of migrant workers.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the Ministry of Railways, the
transport peak will start on January 18, and last until March 8.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has decided to increase 4,000 railroad cars during
this period to transport the estimated 133 million passengers
going home for the Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
It will also try to computerize the booking offices at all
major railway stations across the country to raise efficiency.
And the railroad ticket fare will remain unchanged, the ministry
promised.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the country's road and water traffic will
have a passenger flow of more than 1.53 billion people during the
period, 24 million of them will be rural migrant workers that
travel across provincial borders.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the nearly half million passenger transport
vehicles currently running on the roads and rivers, the Ministry
of Communications plans to increase 35,000 large buses and 180
passenger boats with a total seating capacity of 100,000, to
facilitate the transport of migrant workers.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Security issued a circular yesterday
requiring increased manpower of police in localities to maintain
transportation order by cracking down on illegally reselling
tickets for profits and crimes of swindling or robbing passengers.
</P>
<P>
Safety checks will also be strengthened during this period of
time to curb the number of occurrences of explosion, fire and
other tragedies.

BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- China National United Oil Corp
(Chinaoil), one of a few Chinese companies that are allowed to
deal in the oil trade, hopes to become a major oil trading company
in the next century, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
A joint venture between China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC)

(Sinochem), Chinaoil deals with about half of China's crude oil
exports.
</P>
<P>
The company's exports for crude oil this year are estimated at

earned 860 million US dollars last year from exporting 7.07
million tons.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan Cracks Down on Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan has confiscated 1.5
tons of drugs in 150 cases of drug smuggling in a nationwide
anti-drug drive.
</P>
<P>
Drug-related crime has been rampant in Kazakhstan in recent
years, the newspaper All Over The Globe reported today.
</P>
<P>
The location of Kazakhstan in Central Asia made the country an
ideal corridor for international drug smuggling, where drugs from
Afghanistan and Tajikistan were smuggled to the former Soviet
countries and Europe, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Drug smuggling in border areas has also exacerbated illegal
drug trade inside Kazakhstan, where 700 cases of drug trafficking
had been busted in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The number of drug addicts has increased in Kazakhstan.
According to statistics from the country's judicial department,
there were 18,000 registered drug addicts in Kazakhstan. But
reports from public health services said that at least 100,000
people had sought medical treatment because of drug addiction.

Cruz de la Sierra Declaration approved today.
</P>
<P>
The declaration called on the nations to make earnest efforts
to curb pollution and prevent environmental degradation in their

</P>
<P>
Poverty alleviation is an integral part of sustainable
development and that prosperity will be achieved only through
policies that tackle properly the relations between human beings
and nature, said the declaration.
</P>
<P>
It proposed that all the countries on the continent commit
themselves to implementing institutional reforms and programs that
sustain development.

The governments of the countries in Latin America pledged to
support and promote, as a fundamental requisite for sustainable
development, a full public participation in the decision making
process.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who also attended the day-long

<HEADLINE> MILF Recruits Fighters in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF), a major rebel group in the Philippines, is launching
a recruiting drive among young Muslims in preparation for an
offensive against the government, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
An intelligence report submitted to newly-appointed Armed
Forces Chief of Staff Arnulfo Acedera said rebels in Zamboanga del
Norte Province in southern Mindanao have recruited at least 15
fighters early this week.
</P>
<P>
To show its force to the government, the MILF was also
reportedly prepared to intensify its illegal activities including
kidnapping and robbery, especially this month, as Christians
celebrate the Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
In response to the new development in Mindanao, the military
and police authorities have stepped up operations against the
rebel group.
</P>
<P>
The authorities said operations including air strikes would
continue in order to flush out the rebels from their hiding places
in Sirawai and the Siocon hinterlands, both in Zamboanga del Norte
Province.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has been in clashes with government troops since the
Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), the former biggest rebel
group in the country, signed a final peace agreement with the
government last September.
</P>
<P>
As a breakaway faction of the MNLF, the MILF, however, refused
to accept the peace accord and asked for separate peace talks with
the government.
</P>
<P>
Despite their efforts in the past months, the two sides still
had some disputes in their preparatory work for the talks. The
government announced last week that the talks may start early next
year.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Get Fighter Planes From South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Air Force will
soon get a squadron of updated F-5E "Freedom Fighters" from South
Korea, local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
These modern fighter planes will serve as training aircraft for
the air force which is preparing for the procurement of new
multirole supersonic fighters from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Wiliam Hotchkiss, air force commander, was quoted as
saying the F-5Es are ideal transition jets for "pilots who will
soon handle the more complicated multirole jets that the country
will buy as part of its modernization program."
</P>
<P>
The Northrop-made F-5s have long been the country's premier
interceptors since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Hotchkiss said that before pilots can handle the multirole
jets, they need to train in a lead-in fighter like the F-5E, which
is less complicated and slower.
</P>
<P>
He said pilots and ground crew are experienced in handling the
ordinary F-5s and will need a few hours of training to familiarize
themselves with the updated F-5Es.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has planned to procure two squadrons of
multirole jet fighters from abroad and will soon choose from the
Russian Mig 29, the American F-16 or F-18, the French Mirage and
the Israeli KFir2, the reports said.

BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- While the award-winning Chinese
movies are playing in foreign cinemas, Chinese TV programs have

reported.
</P>
<P>
As China's TV industry takes off, exports of its programs are
growing steadily, said Zhang Yongfu, general manager of the China

rights to Asian countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The other orders have come from the United States, France and
Australia for video rentals.
</P>
<P>
And TV drama series, based on classic literature and legends,

COLOMBO, December 8 (Xinhua)-- Seven Sri Lankan customs
officers and two Tamil businessmen have been arrested for
allegedly smuggling 100 containers of textiles into the country
and at least seven containers of weapons for Tamil rebels.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports today, investigations made by
the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) have found that the
officers have been paid over 100 million rupees (about 20,000 U.S.
dollars) as bribes by the businessmen during the last two years in
order to bring the goods duty-free into the country.
</P>
<P>
The textiles were reportedly worth 100 million rupees per
container.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the CID investigations also revealed that the
textiles and weapons had been declared falsely as goods imported
under the Board of Investment (BOI) duty-free concessions and
carried by BOI labels and stickers.
</P>
<P>
Five customs officers are now on remand while the other two are
in CID custody, the reports said, adding that two millionaire
businessmen are being interrogated by CID detectives.

<HEADLINE> High Cost of Alcohol Ads Spurs Debate in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A recent auction bid for the
rights to prime time advertising in China's Central TV has shocked
the public and triggered arguments on controlling the liquor
industry, the China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Qinchi Distillery, located in East China's Shandong
Province, already the highest bidder last year, won this years'
rivalry with an offer almost five times higher, at 320 million
yuan (38.6 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The bid launched another round of contention over the liquor
industry," the daily said, adding that "the average people were
shocked."
</P>
<P>
"Is advertising really worth such an enormous amount of
money? Does China really need such outrageous sums from liquor
ads?" it asked.
</P>
<P>
It quoted some as arguing: Is it time for the country to
control liquor manufacturing, one of the largest industrial grain
consumers, since China cherish every grain of rice to feed its 1.2
billion people?
</P>
<P>
"I am disgusted about spirit advertising. It's really a great
waste of money," a customer in a downtown Beijing shopping center
said.
</P>
<P>
But there are people who have different ideas in their minds.
As a tradition drink with a 1,000-year history, white alcohol has
become a part of the Chinese culture and is widely sold throughout
the country, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In order to gain a greater share of the highly lucrative
market, distilleries have used every means, including a
bombardment of TV ads. In recent years, white liquor distilleries
have become the major backers of Chinese TV stations, which keep
raising air fees.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to win the bid at whatever cost," said Ji
Changkong, manager of the Qinchi Distillery.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the public barely knew his distillery, but by
the November auction, its total sales had reached 800 million
yuan, with pre-tax profits topping 250 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Ji attributed the company's success to sweeping TV
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
"It is impractical to save grain by cutting alcohol production,
since we have the support of market demand," a China brewery
official said.
</P>
<P>
"However, the industry does need technological and structural
reform to produce a liquor with a low alcohol content to redue
grain consumption," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Becomes Tough Over Territorial Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine will never concede to
Russia in maintaining its territorial integrity and is likely to
take resolute actions over the territorial issue of Sevastopol,
Secretary of Ukraine's Security Council Vladimir Gorbulin said
today.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent response to the remarks of Mayor of Moscow Uri
Luzhkov, Gorbulin said Luzhkov's statement will not serve the
normal relations of Ukraine and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Luzhkov said earlier today that Russia could "resort to force"
to solve the problem over the status of Sevastopol, the main base
of the Black Sea Fleet.
</P>
<P>
"If the Russian government has a different opinion from
Luzhkov, the Russian Foreign Ministry should make an explanation,"
Gorbulin said.
</P>
<P>
He said Ukraine has prepared plans for various measures,
including the possibility of calling for the international
community's guarantee of its security and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
"Solutions to the (Sevastopol) disputes will have impact on our
foreign policies," said Gorbulin, who denied Ukraine would ask
NATO to help settle the row between Russia and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-Ukrainian ties have soured due to disputes over
the ownership of Sevastopol and the Black Sea Fleet. Both claimed
Sevastopol their territory.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Federation Council (the Upper House of parliament)
passed a resolution Friday, claiming Sevastopol Russia's
territory. The Ukraine Supreme Soviet reacted immediately,
adopting a similar resolution on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Gorbulin said, "we always believe incidents similar to that of
the former Yugoslavia will never happen on the land of the former
Soviet Union."
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Russian President Boris Yeltsin's viewpoint will
dominate the development of the issue, but they can't rule out the
possibility that the international community or a third country is
willing to mediate between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Firms Vow to Protect Their Interests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Union is under
fire for its recent decision to impose a temporary 22.6 percent
anti-dumping duties on Chinese-exported unbleached cotton fabric,
China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese companies and enterprises last week vowed to fight back
and protect their interests.
</P>
<P>
"The EU decision is groundless and unacceptable," said Yu Boge,
vice-president of China National Textiles Import and Export
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
He continued, "we would go on fighting through lawyers, and we
strongly recommend that our government take corresponding measures
to protect our lawful interests."
</P>
<P>
On November 20, the EU announced it would slash preliminary
anti-dumping tariffs on unbleached cotton cloth exported by China,
India, Pakistan, Egypt, Indonesia and Turkey, following an
investigation initiated on February 21 this year.
</P>
<P>
The result of such a move could be severe, according to the
paper.
</P>
<P>
"If no big changes are made in the final decision next May,
nearly all Chinese unbleached cotton cloth exports to the EU will
be forced out of that market, and thousands of Chinese textiles
workers might lose their jobs," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
China exports about 100 million US dollars worth of unbleached
cotton fabric to the EU annually. The process involves more than
100 Chinese manufactures and about 20 foreign trade companies.
</P>
<P>
Yu urged the EU to abandon its out-dated practice of labeling
China a "non-market economy" and to stop using figures from a
third country to judge the production cost of Chinese products.
</P>
<P>
A local legal expert said the case "typically reflects the EU's
intensifying trade protectionism," with several "unreasonable
points" existing in the EU's anti-dumping charges.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that in recent years, anti-dumping cases
involving Chinese exports to the EU have increased rapidly. More
than 60 such investigations have been initiated.

<HEADLINE> TV Home Shopping to Be Popular in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- TV home shopping, long regarded
as a lark horse in the retail industry, soon may be popular in
China, the China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
As a modern retail outlet first appeared in the US in 1980,
home shopping made its debut in China in November of 1995 on
Beijing Television (BTV) as part of a programme called "TV
Shopping."
</P>
<P>
And last April, "TV Marketing," a 20-minute programme began
regular broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, with products rising from two to more than 100
and hotline calls going from 200 to 1,000 every day, its profits
from sales have increased five-fold, the daily reported.
</P>
<P>
After BTV, stations in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Weihai and
some other major cities also started home shopping programmes, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Home shopping is expected to spread quickly in major chinese
cities, according to experts at last weekend's Cross-Century
Symposium on TV Marketing in China.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yilin, an associate professor at People's University,
described the service as the most promising enterprise in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Convenience, low prices, detailed presentation, rich variety
and guaranteed after-sales services are the key to the success of
home shopping in China.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Ping, a factory director, said television marketing has
generated more than one million yuan (120,000 US dollars) sales
since the the factory began co-operating with BTV in April.

<HEADLINE> World Cup Men's Downhill Cancelled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The men's season-opening World
Cup downhill race at Whistler Mountain was called off after wet
snow and foggy conditions forced cancellation of all practice runs
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Rules call for at least one training run to be completed
before a World Cup downhill race can be staged and officials had
hoped to get in a training session Saturday morning and a race
later in the day.
</P>
<P>
The first three scheduled training runs were all cancelled by
heavy snow and poor visibility. On Saturday, soft snow and fog
left the Dave Murray Downhill Course too dangerous to traverse at
high speeds, officials declared.
</P>
<P>
World Cup officials said the downhill will be made up at a
later date in Europe, possibly next weekend with a double
downhill at Val d'Isere, France.

<HEADLINE> South Korea and UAE Set for Quarter-final Spots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 7 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and hosts the
United Arab Emirates moved one step closer to the Asian Cup
quarter-finals after contrasting victories in group A matches on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
South Korea beat Indonesia 4-2 while the UAE staged a
remarkable second half comeback to beat Kuwait 3-2 after trailing
2-0 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
With one game each to play, South Korea lead the group on goal
difference from the UAE with four points. Kuwait and Indonesia
have a point apiece.
</P>
<P>
The winners and runners-up of the three groups plus the two
best third-placed teams qualify for the knockout stage.
</P>
<P>
South Korea looked worthy of the tag of one of Asias top sides
for the first 55 minutes against Indonesia. They scored three
times in the opening quarter of an hour and added a fourth after
the break to lead 4-0.
</P>
<P>
But they then relaxed, conceding two goals from rare
counter-attacks.
</P>
<P>
Kim Do Hoon and Hwang Sun Hong gave the Koreans a flying start
with goals in the fifth and seventh minutes. Hwang scored his
second eight minutes later.
</P>
<P>
The Koreans dominated for the rest of the half but scorned
five clear-cut chances.
</P>
<P>
A fourth goal, scored by Ko Jeong Woon 10 minutes into the
second half, hinted at a rout but the Indonesians refused to let
their heads drop.
</P>
<P>
Ronny Wabia scored direct from a corner kick in the 58th
minute and then seven minutes later Widodo Putra, who scored a
spectacular goal against Kuwait on Wednesday, was again on target
with a low shot.
</P>
<P>
The UAE, booed off at halftime after conceding goals to Jassem
Al Huwaidi in the ninth and 44th minutes, were a different side in
the second half.
</P>
<P>
They were level within 10 minutes of the restart thanks to
headed goals by Hassan Ahmed and Adnan Al Talyani.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's misery was complete 10 minutes from time when
midfielder Bakhit Saad ran on to a pass from substitute Zuhair
Bakhait to score the winner.

<HEADLINE> Engine Trouble Suspected as Cause of Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Left engine trouble was
strongly suspected as the cause of the fire and crash of a small
plane near Banjarmasin, capital city of South Kalimantan Province,
Indonesia, the Antara News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Commandant of Syamsuddin Noor Airport Akhmad Nasra quoted
eyewitnesses as saying the propeller of the small plane did not
turn shortly before it went down.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff from the airport at
15:23 pm local time on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated plane crashed into a gas factory, killing the two
pilots and 13 passengers as well as a worker of the plant, while
three others sustained serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
The owner of the gas factory was reported to be suing the
airline company for the damage caused by the plane crash, which is
estimated at 500 million rupiah (about 220,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The owner of the crashed plane, the Dirgantara Air Service
(DAS), did not issue a statement on the mishap and left everything
to an investigation team of the Ministry of Transportation, said
the report.

<HEADLINE> Goetschl Wins First World Cup Downhill in Alpine Skiing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Renate Goetschl
survived a near spill a few meters from the finish to collect her
first ski World Cup downhill victory at Vail, Colorado on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Goetschl, skiing 26th, was posted a winning time of one minute
47.71 seconds, with World Cup points leader Katja Seizinger of
Germany clocking 1:48.53. Islode Kostner of Italy finished third
in 1:48.91.
</P>
<P>
The race was the first of a novel Saturday double event on the
same hill, the result by a Friday snowstorm that forced a day's
delay in the downhill. The super G originally scheduled for
Saturday was to be run later in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Leading at every interval, Goetschl found her moment of truth
on the steep face leading to the finish. Flying far off the lip,
she landed off balance on one ski, the other flailing off to the
side. But she righted herself and sped safely to the finish.
</P>
<P>
It was the the fourth World Cup win of Goetschl's career. She
now has victories in three disciplines -- downhill, Super G and
slalom, along with a combined.
</P>
<P>
Seizinger, who maintained her downhill lead and padded her
advantage in the overall standings, professed to be satisfied with
her result.

<HEADLINE> Gladishiva Wins World Cup Super G in Women's Alpine Skiing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian Svetlana Gladishiva
won the women's World Cup super G at Vail, Colorado of the United
States on Saturday, stunning long-time champion Sweden's Pernilla
Wiberg.
</P>
<P>
Gladishiva skied down from the 32nd start position to win her
first World Cup victory of her 10-year career by clocking one
minute 17.76 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Wiberg, thwarted in her bid for a 12th World Cup victory and
second super G win of the season, settled for second place in
1:17.97. Carole Montillet of France, another late starter in 29th
position, took third in 1:18.11.
</P>
<P>
While the fourth place was taken by Hilde Gerg of Germany,
Isolde Kostner of Italy, who finished third in a downhill race
earlier Saturday, finished fifth in the Super G.
</P>
<P>
The afternoon race was held following the downhill event in the
same day because of a Friday snowstorm that postponed the
downhill. Renate Goetschl of Austria won the downhill race.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Gladishiva never had been better than 13th in
World Cup super G, although she came from a similar late start to
claim a silver medal in the event at the 1994 Lillehammer
Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Krajisnik Says Serbs to Try Own War Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 7 (Xinhua) -- A Bosnian Serb senior official
said Saturday the Serbs were committed to cooperation with the
international war crimes tribunal, but would not allow extradition
of Serb suspects as its constitution and law do not allow this.
</P>
<P>
Serb member of Bosnia's collective presidency Momcilo Krajisnik
said at a press conference in Serb administrative center in Pale
the war crimes suspects will be tried by special courts in
Republika Srpska if evidence is proved.
</P>
<P>
The Serb former leader Radovan Karadzic and the former Serb
army commander Ratko Mladic are among the most wanted war
criminals by the Hague-based U.N. tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia. The international court has so far listed 75 suspects
but only seven are now under custody.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik said Serbs were equally treated, for the first time,
at latest international conferences on Bosnia in Lisbon and
London.
</P>
<P>
He attended the London conference as a member of the Bosnian
presidency. The conference discussed the prominent issues in
Bosnia, such as the repatriation of refugees, the arrest and trial
of war crimes and the reconstruction of the war-devastated
economy.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik said political and economic equality of the three
peoples in Bosnia -- Serbs, Muslims and Croats -- and of the two
entities -- Republika Srpska and Muslim-Croat Federation -- "is
the key to Bosnia's survival," Tanjug news agency reported from
Pale.
</P>
<P>
Underlining that Republika Srpska has not yet adopted a
definite stance on the structure of Bosnia's ministerial council
which should be established soon, Krajisnik said the Serb entity
was ready to work within joint Bosnian authorities.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Brcko, a town in northeastern Bosnia with
unresolved status, Krajisnik said this was an important issue for
the preservation of peace in Bosnia and must be resolved in the
spirit of the Dayton peace agreement. Both Republika Srpska and
Muslim-Croat Federation claim sovereignty over this strategic town
which links the eastern and western parts of Republika Srpska.
Under Dayton agreement, the final decision on its status should be
made later this month by an arbitration committee.

<HEADLINE> Commander of U.S. Air Base on Azores Relieved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Air Force said
Saturday that a commander of a major U.S. air base in Portugal's
mid-Atlantic Azores Islands has been relieved of his duties and is
being investigated.
</P>
<P>
In reading the statement of the matter, Air Force spokeswoman
Maj. Ginger Blazicko did not say what prompted the investigation
of Col. Melvin M. Reeves, which began November 7.
</P>
<P>
She said Reeves was removed last week because Lt. Gen. Phillip
J. Ford, commander of the 8th Air Force in Barksvale, Louisiana,
"lost confidence in Reeves' ability and fitness to command."
</P>
<P>
Reeves' deputy, Col. John Calvert, took command of the Azores
base pending appointment of a replacement, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force routinely does not release information during
investigations, Blazicko said. But she noted that "this action was
not taken as a result of improper activities directed at any
Portuguese citizen."
</P>
<P>
It was learned that the Lisbon daily Diario de Noticias
newspaper reported Saturday that Reeves was under investigation on
allegations of sexual harassment, but the paper gave no details.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Americans to Leave Central African Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
issued a travel warning on Saturday to urge Americans already in
the Central African Republic to leave and others not to travel
there because of escalation of fighting in a 3-week-old army
mutiny.
</P>
<P>
The State Department warning, citing "military and civil
unrest", said "the security situation remains uncertain" in the
country.
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 15, a band of renegade soldiers took up arms to protest
low pay and the army's diminished role under President Ange-Felix
Patasse,.
</P>
<P>
The rebels demanded Patasse's resignation and said he has
undermined the army's role by relying upon foreign troops to stay
in power.
</P>
<P>
Patasse has refused to step down and is demanding that the
rebels disarm before he will consider their grievances.
</P>
<P>
The United States has authorized nonessential embassy employees
and family members of the mission's employees to leave, the State
Department said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations began evacuating staff families on Friday
from the capital Bangui.

<HEADLINE> Syrian PM: Syria Not To Yield An Inch of Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Prime Minister Mahmoud
el Zouebi today said his country will not yield even an inch of
its territory to Israel, urging a complete withdrawal of Israelis
from all occupied Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Zouebi pointed out the
region "is now experiencing hard conditions as a result of
Israel's intransigent stand."
</P>
<P>
He recalled Syria's efforts in pushing for the Middle East
peace, saying "Syria proved through positive initiatives that it
is eager to get a fair and overall peace achieved in the region."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Jewish settlement expansion, the Syrian
prime minister said, "Israel has even gone farther to extreme,
with its intransigence, its threats and its expansion of Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the Syrian Golan
Heights creating a state of tension and worry in the region."
</P>
<P>
This extremely intransigent stand of Israel is "aimed at
undermining the Middle East peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that his country has once and again announced
that achieving a fair and overall peace in the Middle East is a
strategic option of Syria, and that the peace talks should resume
at the point where they suspended.
</P>
<P>
Zouebi concluded that the United States, as a co-sponsor of the
peace talks, should bear the major responsibility for saving the
peace process deadlocked due to Israel's hardline policy, and
that this is the only way to make it possible to establish a
genuine peace in the region.
