REDSKINS DEFLATE GIANTS, 16-6 
</HEADLINE>
   By RAFAEL HERMOSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ For three weeks, the New York Giants had
done what they expected of themselves. As they defeated weak
opponent after weak opponent, their confidence grew to the point
where they considered Sunday night's game with the Washington
Redskins their biggest contest in years.
</P>
<P>
   But the Giants quickly showed that the struggling Redskins may
still lead the league in talent. The Giants' defense, so strong in
stopping inexperienced offenses in previous weeks, allowed Brad
Johnson to silence Washington's quarterback controversy. The
Giants' offense sputtered for the entire game, the first time this
season it has been unable to move the ball.
</P>
<P>
   A Giants Stadium crowd of 78,216 had hoped the team's 3-0 start
was not a fluke, but Washington's 16-6 victory prevented the Giants
from seizing control of the National Football Conference East. They
still lead the division with a 3-1 record, while the Redskins
improved to 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants played as if they were outmatched. They had beaten
Arizona, Philadelphia and Chicago, three teams that proved weaker
than initially thought. Washington carried the baggage of an
underachieving team and an overanxious owner, but it also brought a
boatload of talent into the game.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Washington team many expected when it went on a
shopping spree during the off-season. Johnson dissected the Giants'
secondary, finally using the long pass successfully, completing 14
of 20 passes for 289 yards and 2 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' special teams also faltered. When the Giants were
about to get the ball back on a punt with two minutes left in the
fourth quarter, the rookie Brandon Short was offside, giving
Washington a first down and essentially ending the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' offense, which looked so fluid through three games,
was unable to mount any attack and showed problems playing from
behind. The Giants' offense has revolved around the running game,
but Tiki Barber and Ron Dayne totaled just 88 yards.
</P>
<P>
   After the first quarter, the Giants did not enter Washington
territory until late in the third quarter. That drive ended at the
50-yard line after Kenard Long sacked Kerry Collins, who was
pressured all night, for an 11-yard loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' next drive went deep into Washington's side of the
field, but Collins' pass from the 23-yard line to Ike Hilliard in
the end zone was underthrown and intercepted by Deion Sanders, who
returned the ball 28 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Collins' 7-yard touchdown pass to Hilliard with 2 minutes 25
seconds left averted the Giants' first shutout since 1996. Dayne
was stopped short of the end zone on the attempted 2-point
conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Collins completed 21 of 44 passes for 210 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants trailed by 10-0 at halftime, and Washington did not
allow the Giants to rally in the second half. The Redskins scored
on the opening drive of the half, fueled by a 53-yard pass from
Johnson to Albert Connell on third and three. Giants free safety
Shaun Williams was covering Connell, but he fell out of bounds as
Connell leaped for the catch. Connell also fell as he landed, but
he rolled over and gained another 15 yards before he was tackled.
</P>
<P>
   On the next play, Johnson completed a 21-yard touchdown pass to
Andre Reed, who was signed to replace the injured Michael Westbrook
at wide receiver earlier this season. The half was less than two
minutes old and the Giants trailed by 16-0, as the Redskins missed
the extra point.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were giving a nationally televised audience a first
view of the team's expanded offense on Sunday night, but the unit
was unable to produce anything close to its previous output. Much
of that had to do with an offensive line that received its first
major test of the season. For three games, the rebuilt line had
held up well, but the Redskins produced the best pass rush the
Giants have seen so far.
</P>
<P>
   Collins was sacked only three times in the Giants' first three
games, but the Redskins had two sacks by halftime. Bruce Smith hit
Collins for an eight-yard loss in the first quarter. Washington's
Marco Coleman had the other sack, pinning Collins at the Giants'
8-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Without the time he had grown accustomed to, Collins completed
only 7 of 18 passes in the first half. That was well short of the
71.3 completion percentage he carried into the game.
</P>
<P>
   The touted running combination of Thunder and Lightning was not
much better. Barber managed only 44 yards on nine carries, while
Dayne totaled 11 yards on three rushes. The Giants had only 84
yards of total yards in the half, compared to Washington's 202.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants led the National Football League in time of
possession entering the game, but trailed even in that category in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive star of the first half was the much-maligned
Johnson. He kept his job this week after two consecutive Washington
losses, but Jeff George was waiting on the sidelines. Johnson put
the quarterback controversy to rest, at least temporarily, by
completing 8 of 11 passes for one touchdown in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a Pro Bowl selection who passed for more than 4,000
yards last season, lamented the offense's inability to complete the
long pass through the Redskins' first three games. Johnson had not
completed a pass longer than 26 yards entering the game, and that
was to a running back. His longest pass to a wide receiver went
only for 22 yards. But the long pass was not a problem for
Washington tonight. He completed passes of more than 26 yards three
times in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' defense walked off the field to cheers after forcing
the Redskins to punt from their 28-yard line in the first quarter.
But the defense allowed seven Redskins plays for gains in
Washington's next series.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson completed a 46-yard pass over Giants cornerback Dave
Thomas to wideout James Thrash in the second quarter to set up
Washington's first score, a 23-yard pass to Irving Fryar for a 7-0
Redskins lead. That marked the first time the Giants had trailed
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's next possession featured a 48-yard completion to
Connell. Johnson found Connell between defensive backs Jason Sehorn
and Williams, throwing the ball just before Giants linebacker
Jessie Armstead put Johnson on his back.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins settled for a field goal, and the 10-0 lead that
they carried into the half. &QL;

THIS STAR SHINES BRIGHTLY IN SYDNEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ She's an Aborigine and a history maker. She
carried the Olympic torch and on Sunday she was running the 400
meters on her country's back porch.
</P>
<P>
   While Nova Peris-Kneebone might not be as fast as teammate Cathy
Freeman, she is every inch as fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta, Peris-Kneebone competed for
Australia in field hockey and became the first Aborigine to win an
Olympic gold medal. Having reached the summit in one sport,
Peris-Kneebone looked for another mountain to climb.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't have to squint.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at my scrapbooks as a kid,'' Peris-Kneebone said,
``I was a runner before I was a hockey player.''
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old mother of one settled on the 200 meters. By 1998
she was the Commonwealth champion in the event.
</P>
<P>
   She added the 400 meters shortly thereafter. Peris-Kneebone
clocked a personal best of 51.28 in the Olympic quarterfinals in
only her 14th race at the distance to advance to the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   There she ran into rain and, coming out of the third turn,
considerable pain. She finished last in her heat in 52.49.
Peris-Kneebone needed to drop her newly minted personal best
another .09-seconds in the adverse conditions to squeak into the
eight-woman final.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, her country's brightest hope for a gold medal in track,
led all finalists in 50.01.
</P>
<P>
   Peris-Kneebone and the 27-year-old Freeman train together and
make up half of the Aussies' 1,600-meter relay team. Each will also
compete in the 200 meters on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the 200, Peris-Kneebone will face another accomplished two-
sport athlete in Marion Jones, who helped North Carolina to the
NCAA basketball title in 1994 before deciding to concentrate on
track in the fall of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman enjoys as wide a following here as Jones does in the
U.S. Peris-Kneebone speaks glowingly of her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been awesome. Absolutely awesome,' Peris-Kneebone said
Sunday as she watched Freeman's semifinal run on a television in
the mixed zone where journalists and athletes converge. ``Just a
great help.''
</P>
<P>
   The world watched Freeman, a silver medalist in the 400 meters
at the 1996 Atlanta Games, light the Olympic cauldron to open these
27th Summer Games officially. A rapt nation looked on much earlier
as Peris-Kneebone became the first person to carry the torch on
Australian soil in Uluru, which is in her native Northern
Territory.
</P>
<P>
   Peris-Kneebone came by the honor honestly. She was a defender on
the field hockey team that cobbled together a 39-game unbeaten
streak, which culminated with a 3-1 win over South Korea in the
Olympic final.
</P>
<P>
   Six members of the 1996 squad have returned to help the
Hockeyroos defend their Olympic title. Peris-Kneebone is with the
women in spirit. She regrets she hasn't had a chance to catch any
of the team's preliminary games. She misses the camaraderie that
comes with being a part of something larger than herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a team sport, you have your teammates around you,'' Peris-
Kneebone said. ``If you miss a tackle, you have a very guilty
feeling because you let your teammates down. For me to go out in
the semifinal of the 400, I have only myself to answer to.''
</P>
<P>
   Peris-Kneebone couldn't be too cross at herself for not
advancing to the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me to be in the semifinal in the 15th 400 I've run in my
life, that's a pretty good effort,'' she said. ``I'm still learning
in the event.''
</P>
<P>
   She plans to graduate to some other challenge before the next
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about 2004,'' she said. ``Maybe one more year
I'll run.''
</P>
<P>
   Peris-Kneebone is an accomplished artist. She designed one of
the Olympic-edition Swatch watches that are for sale here.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine her star diminishing with time. A nova she
is not.

   &UR; INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ZAMBIA-POLITICS (Luanshya, Zambia) _ This struggling town in the
country's Copperbelt has suffered more than most at the hands of
copper's cascading fortunes and government's lamentable efforts to
manage the nation's most precious natural resource. So it is hardly
happenstance that the politicking that will likely frame the
campaign for presidential elections next year is centering on this
eroded expanse of industrial promise. By Henri E. Cauvin.

   &UR; NATIONAL _ GENERAL (Moved in ``a'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PRISON-HEALTHSERVICE (New York) _ It was founded 22 years ago by
a registered nurse who was disturbed by slipshod medical care he
witnessed at a suburban Philadelphia county jail. Today, Prison
Health Services is the central piece of a $400-million-a-year
corporation, one that delivers everything from dental check ups to
cardiac care to 175,000 inmates in 28 states across the country.
But as PHS moves to take on the greatest challenge in its history _
a nearly $100-million-a-year contract to care for 13,000 prisoners
at New York City jails _ some government officials say it has
occasionally failed to deliver quality care. By Eric Lipton.
</P>
<P>
   CHILDREN-MEDIA (Undated) _ In Washington, the debate has focused
on violent films, recordings and electronic games and how they are
marketed. But some childhood development experts contend that the
issue is not just what children see, but how and where they see it.
Private household choices _ where to put the family computer or
video game console, how many television sets a household owns _ can
greatly affect the impact these entertainments have. As more of the
machines find their way into children's rooms, ``the whole pattern
of use of mass media works to isolate children from adults,'' said
William Damon, director of the Stanford University Center on
Adolescence. By John Leland.

Little Rock saying about the damage the investigation did to their
town and how do they see Bill Clinton in his last months as
president. By Rick Bragg.
</P>
<P>
   DECATUR-FIRESTONE (Decatur, Ill.) _ For residents here, no news
would definitely be good news. Six years ago, they had their first
encounter with the national news media when workers at the city's
three biggest employers went on strike. A year later, the Archer
Daniels Midland Co. got caught up in a global price-fixing scandal.
Now the national spotlight has turned to the city's
Bridgestone/Firestone plant, which produced the bulk of the faulty
tires blamed for more than 100 deaths and about 400 injuries.
People here call their city of 89,000 residents the Pride of the
Prairie. Still, all the bad news can be a bit demoralizing. By

</P>
<P>
   WIS-SWING-VOTERS (Green Bay, Wis.) _ After almost 14 years in
office, Tommy Thompson bestrides Wisconsin politics like a
colossus. But he has never managed to carry his state for his
party's presidential nominee. This time, however, the governor
recently proclaimed, ``I'm not worried.'' If not, he's the only
politician in Wisconsin who isn't. The race between Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore is breathlessly close, in

his or her vote. By Tina Kelley with Neela Banerjee.

<P>
   INVESTOR-PROTECTION (Undated) _ At a time when millions of
Americans have taken their money out of federally insured banks and
put it into brokerage firms, the Securities Investor Protection
Corp., charged with protecting the investing public, has never been
more important. But a close look at the organization shows that the
safety net that investors believe SIPC offers is in fact full of
holes. Indeed, it is a far cry from the agency on which it was
loosely modeled, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. By Gretchen

customers, a person close to AT&AMP;T said over the weekend. By Seth
Schiesel.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-WEB-RIGHTS (Undated) _ The XVII Olympic games may eventually
be remembered for many things, but it will surely be a benchmark in
the struggle between those who hold intellectual property rights in
sporting events and those seeking to cover it for the
ever-expanding universe of news outlets on the Internet. Worried
that the power of the Internet will undercut the television
audience and undermine the economic foundation of the modern
Olympic movement, the International Olympic Committee is going to
extraordinary lengths to control how and where the images and
accounts of the Sydney extravaganza reach the public. By Felicity
Barringer.
</P>
<P>
   DREAMWORKS-MEDIA (Undated) _ When Dreamworks was founded six
years ago by Steven Speilberg, Jefferey Katzenberg and David
Geffen, the entertainment industry braced for a new-style media
company. But so far, the Dreamworks moguls have demonstrated that
they are very good only at Hollywood's oldest profession: making
movies. In music and television programming, they've made barely a
mark. And they seem to have no aptitude at all for New Media. By
Geraldine Fabrikant and Rick Lyman.

</P>
<P>
   OLY-WIRELESS (Sydney, Australia) _ Call it the first wireless
Olympics. The preponderance of cell phones in use at the Sydney
Games make the area the densest locus of wireless traffic anywhere

muscled up for this world-class challenge. By Mark Landler.

   NEW-ECON-COLUMN (Undated) _ The New Economy column: Dozens of
e-commerce portals are starting in Brazil and elsewhere in Latin
America, betting on the democratizing power of the Internet to
break down the traditional information and trade barriers that
confine most small companies in the region to doing business within
30 miles of home. But revolution doesn't happen in a day _ not when
there are so many technical bugs to be worked out. By Jennifer L.
Rich.
</P>
<P>
   ECOMMERCE-COLUMN (Undated) _ The E-Commerce column: Among the
more popular recipes for e-commerce success is a mix of content,
commerce and community features. But sites have been blindsided by
the high cost of content _ whether they're producing it in-house,
buying pieces of content from a handful of partner sites, or both.
More recently, sites are turning to a new breed of Internet
businesses, online content syndicators, to manage the buying and
selling of everything from video and audio clips to feature
stories. By Bob Tedeschi.
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN-AD-COLUMN (Undated) _ The Advertising column: The
firestorm last week over a Nike commercial during the Summer
Olympics, in which a female runner escapes a masked madman wielding
a chainsaw, has reignited a debate about images of women in
advertising. The spot, intended as a spoof of so-called slasher
movies, was widely castigated as making light of violence toward
women and was soon pulled off the air by NBC. By Stuart Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   MOTOROLA-PALM (Undated) _ Motorola Inc. and Palm Inc. plan to
announce on Monday that they will collaborate on a new portable
phone that would put the features of a Palm handheld computer into
a device closer to the size and shape of a cell phone. By Lawrence
M. Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   AIG-GREENBERG (Undated) _ Evan Greenberg, who until his
resignation last week had been in line to take charge of American
International Group, the powerful insurance company led by his
father, Maurice R. Greenberg, is not rushing to find a new job. But
when he decides to make a move, several executive headhunters said
recently, he is likely to have an abundance of choices. By Joseph
Treaster.
</P>

   WIRELESS-LOCATOR (Undated) _ Lucent and MapInfo will announce a
deal to produce wireless-locator technology for helping people use
wireless devices to find stores and restaurants, for example. By

   MURDOCH-MALONE-MEDIA (Undated) _ John C. Malone and Rupert
Murdoch are considering a deal that would increase the size of
their investments in each other's companies, according to people
close to the discussions. By Geraldine Fabrikant.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CULTURE (Moved in ``e'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-SHOCKERS (London) _ It is far from proven that
newspapers sell art, but art certainly seems to sell newspapers in
Britain these days. At least that must be one explanation for the
enormous space given to London's contemporary art scene by the
British press. Newspapers no longer cover major art shows as
cultural events, but as news stories, while the media's devotion to
the celebrity cult routinely turns YBAs _ as young British artists
are now known here _ into showbiz stars. A look at why the Royal
Academy's new `sensation' show by YBAs is the talk of London. By
Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   MAXWELL-INTERVIEW (New York) _ An interview with Richard
Maxwell, the writer-director of ``Boxing 2000.'' His dialogue
resembles nothing you've heard before in the theater, except
perhaps a Pinter play. It sounds like a conversation overheard on a
street corner, bus, or public basketball court. And that, says
Richard Maxwell, who wrote and directed ``Boxing 2000'', which
opened last week on the Lower East Side, is exactly the point. He
wants his characters to sound like real people, not like actors
trying to sound like real people. By Robin Pogrebin.

when you bring up the name. ``I know you were going to ask me about
Charles Barkley,'' the 32-year-old forward of the Angolan national
team said. ``I just knew.'' Coimbra is playing in his third
straight Olympics, eight years after Barkley maliciously elbowed
him in the chest at the Barcelona Games in 1992. If the cheap shot
brought him international sympathy and portrayed Barkley as the
ugliest of Americans _ a quick Polaroid of the world's richest
nation beating up on an impoverished, war-torn African country _ it
also gave Coimbra a name. Noticing the temperament of the 2000 U.S.
team, Coimbra said he does not believe sportsmanship is improving
in America. 800 words. By Mike Wise.

 &HT;    EDUCATION TAX PLAN SUPPORTED(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By ROBBIE SHERWOOD(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - Arizona voters overwhelmingly support Gov. Jane
Hull's plan to raise taxes to increase education spending,
according to an Arizona Republic poll.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Hull has said the public would strongly support one
of the largest tax increases in state history if it would raise
teacher pay and better prepare students for high-tech jobs, and for
now she appears to be right.
</P>
<P>
   If the election were held today, 67 percent said they favor
raising the state sales tax to 5.6 percent from 5 percent to help
pull the state out of the national basement in per-pupil spending.
The tax would set aside $450 million a year to increase teacher
salaries, shrink class sizes, fix schools and spark high-technology
research.
</P>
<P>
   Voters will decide the issue at the polls Nov. 7. One yes vote
will come from Manuel Jaramillo of Tempe, one of the 602 registered
voters from around the state who took part in the poll last week.
The poll has an error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Jaramillo said his faith in public education is at an end, and
he blames low teacher salaries. He said the best teachers are
fleeing the job market for higher-paying jobs and he is seeing the
results in the ill-prepared graduates he must train as a supervisor
at Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an investment in our country and our kids,'' said
Jaramillo, 37. ``We have a lot of people from foreign countries
where I work, and I hear people say, `They are taking our jobs.'
They aren't taking our jobs, we're giving them away.''
</P>
<P>
   Support for the tax hike was strongest among younger voters and
Democrats, at around 75 percent. But even voters 55 and older, not
known to back school measures or tax hikes, showed strong support
for the plan, at 61 percent. And 63 percent of Republicans said
they would vote yes.
</P>
<P>
   Republican poll respondent Sandra Sturgill of Dewey, however,
won't be among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our schools are getting enough money at this point,'' said
Sturgill, 57, who does not work because of a blindness disability.
``I don't think making the tax higher is the solution to the
problem we have in schools today. Pouring on more money will just
layer it on top of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Carlson of Phoenix told pollsters he will be voting no as
well. Carlson, a non-practicing attorney who operates a home-based
mail-order business, said he was one of the pioneering members of
the Libertarian Party in the early 1970s and holds to its beliefs
about public education.
</P>
<P>
   And those beliefs are that there shouldn't be such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The private market ought to be handling all education funding,
completely private schools,'' Carlson said. ``I believe it's up to
parents to provide for their own children's education. The
marketplace can do a much better job of providing schooling than
the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigners for Prop. 301 called the poll results ``fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows exactly what Governor Hull has been saying all
along, that the public is fed up with Arizona being in last place
for education spending,'' said Jaime Molera, Hull's education
adviser. ``Here is a proposal that will make significant increases
and have a positive impact.''
</P>
<P>
   If passed, each of Arizona's 30,000 teachers would get about a
$2,000 raise. That would raise the state's 34th-ranked average
teacher salary of $35,000 a few steps closer to the national
average of $40,000. Teachers would also be eligible for
performance-based raises of up to $6,000 or $7,000 each year.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Arizona residents, Charmaine Forbes moved to the state
from somewhere else. Forbes said the schools in New Jersey did a
better job working with her daughter, who has ``special needs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything to do with education, I am in favor,'' said Forbes,
an event planner who moved to Scottsdale 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Poll respondent Mary Clark of Cottonwood, who has two children
who are teachers, will only support the tax if she's sure it will
be used correctly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for it if it will go to the teachers and shrink the
classroom, but not for administration or building more buildings,''
said Clark, 71. ``We're never going to keep good teachers if we
don't start paying them.''

CREAR RUNS TO 110 HURDLES FINAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Sunday was a good day to be Ian Thorpe at
the Olympic Stadium track. A mist turned into a steady drizzle
right as hurdler Mark Crear was readying himself for his
quarterfinal in the 110-meter hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Crear had won his first heat earlier in the day under dry skies.
When the weather turned ominous, the Valencia resident's
disposition quickly followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh man,'' he remembered thinking, ``This is not the Winter
Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the soggy conditions ensured there would be no
skating through to the semifinals. A wet track is a great
equalizer. It also is the last place Crear wanted to look for his
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   A pulled abdominal muscle had limited the two-time Olympian's
pre-Games races to a precious few. So his objective in the early
heats here was to get battle-tough. But the bad weather forced him
to tread lightly so as not to aggravate his injury.
</P>
<P>
   A false start did nothing to steady Crear's nerves. He was on
the short list of favorites for the 1999 world-championship title
in Seville until he was disqualified in the semifinals after two
false starts.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Crear had nothing to fear. He got out of the
blocks safely and ran a composed third in his heat behind Cuban
Anier Garcia and German Falk Balzer. Crear's time was the 10th-best
among those advancing to today's semifinal (the final also will be
held today).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was swimming out there,'' Crear said. ``I didn't want to
push it too hard. I just wanted to make it to the next round.''
</P>
<P>
   Crear, 31, who earned a sociology degree with a business
emphasis from USC, is trying to get his own apparel company off the
ground. The name of his company is Godspeed and it's a safe bet
he'll be looking to the heavens today for inspiration _ and praying
for no precipitation.
</P>
<P>
   If there's no stopping the rain, there could be no stopping
Colin Jackson. The Englishman, who set the world record of 12.91 in
1993, posted the fastest time in the quarterfinals (13.27).
</P>
<P>
   ``It rains a lot in Great Britain,'' Crear said, cracking a
smile, ``so Colin might have an advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   His competitors know better than to count Crear out. He broke
his arm two weeks before the 1996 Olympics, then took home the
silver medal behind American Allen Johnson. Crear's best time this
season is 13.11. Among the Olympic pool of competitors, only Garcia
(13.07) and Johnson (12.97) have gone faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got 20 more hurdles to go,'' Crear said, and then he was
off to prepare for the reign he hopes is forthcoming.

RED SOX SHUT DOWN IN FENWAY FINALE 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-ORIOLES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Maybe it was a fitting farewell to a home field that
had become a House of Blues.
</P>
<P>
   Handed one of the best opportunities imaginable to win a game
and avoid posting their poorest full-season record at Fenway Park
since President Reagan was staring down the former Soviet Union,
the Red Sox Sunday frittered it away quicker than Abner Doubleday
could spin in his grave.
</P>
<P>
   No outs. Bases loaded. Bottom of the ninth. And up to the plate
strode Mr. Clutch, Brian Daubach, with the Sox trailing, 1-0, in
their season finale in the Fens.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox already had made baseball look harder than heart surgery
by squandering a bases-loaded opportunity with one out in the
seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   And poor Tomo Ohka, who has received a total of six runs from
the Sox in his six losses this year, had just pitched one of the
best games of his brief career.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Tomo.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach hit a towering fly to left field. The wind held it up
for Delino DeShields to camp under in shallow left. And Boston's
Bernard Gilkey, perhaps fresh from watching an Olympic sprint,
shocked a sellout crowd of 32,183 by tagging from third.
</P>
<P>
   The throw from DeShields beat Gilkey to the plate with almost
enough time for catcher Brook Fordyce to down a cup of chowder
before applying the tag for the double play.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, Trot Nixon flied to center. Whereupon the Sox
ended their home season at 42-39, their worst record in a full
season at Fenway since they went 41-40 in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a perfect example to sum up our whole year,'' said
catcher Scott Hatteberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just couldn't put it all together. We had some good
pitching, but we couldn't come through when we needed to.''
</P>
<P>
   The final act unfolded under a gray sky as a cool wind rushed
into the Hub, a harbinger of the October chill in which the Sox had
hoped to play. But not this year, as they stand at the brink of
elimination in both the American League East and the wild-card
race.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox were simply not good enough, at home or away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never really turned it on,'' Pedro Martinez said. ``We were
kind of a mediocre team all season.''
</P>
<P>
   They looked it Sunday, as Orioles ace Mike Mussina mowed them
down, striking out 15 in seven innings. He walked none, scattered
five hits, and didn't allow a runner to reach second until the
seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   With no score, Nomar Garciaparra led off the inning by hustling
out an infield hit. A batter later, Lou Merloni blooped a single
over the head of shortstop Melvin Mora, bringing up Hatteberg.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina got Hatteberg to hit a made-to-order double-play ball to
Mora. But Mora booted it, loading the bases with one out.
</P>
<P>
   No problem for Mussina. He promptly fanned Midre Cummings and
Rico Brogna to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our chances, to say the least,'' manager Jimy Williams
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just couldn't score.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles could in the eighth. Ohka had pitched masterfully
for 7 1/3 innings, the longest start since he broke into the majors
last year. He had retired 15 of the first 16 he had faced. He had
allowed only three hits and no walks, and had put himself in
position to end a five-game winless streak.
</P>
<P>
   But Ohka walked pinch hitter Brady Anderson with one out in the
eighth. Jesus Garcia, running for Anderson, then scampered to third
on a single by Luis Matos.
</P>
<P>
   And Ohka was relieved by Rich Garces, who yielded a sacrifice
fly to Eugene Kingsale. That scored Garcia with the game's only
run.
</P>
<P>
   Ohka was not satisfied with his effort (``not perfect'') and not
bitter about his lack of run support.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how much we score,'' he said through an interpreter,
``I still pitch the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Sox had the game all but gift-wrapped for them in the
bottom of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The inning started with a cameo appearance by Carl Everett, who
had spent days in the center of a storm that seemed to grow more
fierce as the team's playoff hopes dwindled. As he walked to the
plate, Everett was booed more than he was cheered in his last
appearance of the year at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   And it was brief. He drew a leadoff walk and was replaced by a
pinch runner, Gilkey. Hatteberg then lined a single to right,
moving Gilkey to second. And when the Baltimore pitcher, Ryan
Kohlmeier, slipped trying to field a bunt by Donnie Sadler, the
bases were loaded for Daubach.
</P>
<P>
   Asked afterward about Gilkey's suicidal dash to the plate,
Williams said he would ``take responsibility'' for the miscue.
</P>
<P>
   Third base coach Wendell Kim, who has frequently endured the
crowd's wrath this season, was quick to shoulder the blame as well.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Gilkey went on his own, Kim said at first, ``He went.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Kim amended it. ``I sent him,'' he said. ``It's my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast. Gilkey had the last word.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a judgment call,'' Gilkey said. ``I decided to go ahead
and try to get in there.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he figured the wind would make the play difficult for
DeShields to plant himself for a strong throw to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was mistaken,'' Gilkey said. ``He made a good throw and
got me by a pretty good margin.''
</P>
<P>
   So it went in a dismal end to a disappointing season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad,'' Hatteberg said. ``Everybody's frustrated. We
have a lot of guys who played really hard and put their heart and
soul out there all year and we came up short.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he spoke the words that have long been Boston's September
song.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always next year,'' he said.

PATRIOTS NOT SO HOT IN MIAMI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ On a sizzling September day at Pro Player Stadium that
was so hot many Dolphins fans didn't show, the Patriots may have
watched their season melt into oblivion. With its 10-3 loss to
Miami Sunday, New England's chance of rebounding from an 0-4 start,
its worst beginning since the 5-11 1993 season, appears minuscule.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth straight game, Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe
had a chance to tie or win it on the last series, but couldn't pull
it off. He's asking for a few good Patriots to join him in battling
back and not giving up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be there with him,'' said wide receiver Terry Glenn, who
caught five passes for 65 yards, including a 28-yarder from Bledsoe
on a fourth and 1 that put the Patriots in position to get the
tying score late in the game. ``We're going to come in here and
keep practicing and keep getting it right,'' Glenn said. ``It's one
or two plays we don't make every game. That's not a disaster. If we
can get it cranking on all cylinders, we can start winning games.
The big thing now is to win the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   There were two crucial mistakes, both in the second quarter:
Kevin Faulk's fumble at the Dolphin 3, and blown coverage on a
touchdown pass from Jay Fiedler to Bert Emanuel for 53 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with 1:08 left in the game and the ball at the Miami 5, on
fourth and 2, offensive coordinator Charlie Weis called a fade to
Eric Bjornson in the hope the 6-foot-3-inch tight end would be able
to jump and take the ball from a safety or a cornerback. In this
case, he drew cornerback Patrick Surtain. It was the perfect
situation, but with less-than-perfect results.
</P>
<P>
   Bjornson was trying desperately to get Surtain's hands off him.
The Patriots felt it was interference, or at least defensive
holding. As soon as Bledsoe released the ball, he yelled, ``Pass
interference.'' There was no flag. Bledsoe darted toward the
official. The flag stayed in the official's pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surtain got his hands on me one-on-one, and he disrupted me
enough to win,'' said Bjornson. ``If it was pass interference it
wasn't good enough to be called. I should have gotten better
release from the line. He got his hands on me quicker than I could
get his hands off me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe had Glenn open on the other side, but even Glenn said,
``The right play was called. Charlie figured I'd get double-covered
in the slot, which I had been all game.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Fiedler had found Oronde Gadsden on a 44-yard hookup
after Fiedler had stepped up and away from pressure and led
Gadsden, who made a breakaway move on Otis Smith, for the
completion. Credit Tebucky Jones with a touchdown-saving tackle.
</P>
<P>
   But on the next play Fiedler was pressured by defensive end
Bobby Hamilton, who had him by the left arm. He tried to flip the
ball forward, but it landed in defensive tackle Henry Thomas's
arms. The 35-year-old, despite the heat and humidity, ran it 16
yards to the 35.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots then mounted a very effective 12-play drive to the
22, but it resulted in a field goal, not a touchdown. Bledsoe
completed a 17-yard pass to Chris Calloway to get into Dolphins
territory at the 47. He also made a big 11-yard throw to Glenn, who
made an acrobatic catch on a ball thrown behind him, then avoided
two tacklers to get the first down at the 23. But a 1-yard run by
Tony Carter and two incompletions brought on Adam Vinatieri, who
got a clean hold by Lee Johnson on the dirt infield and knuckled
the ball over the crossbar with 14:43 remaining in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a defensive lapse: Kato Serwanga was beaten on the
bomb on third and 4 from Fiedler to Emanuel with 11:30 remaining in
the second. Serwanga was a half-step behind, and as the ball
arrived, Emanuel got a bit of separation, then stumbled in for the
score. Serwanga was supposed to get help from Tony George, but the
second-year safety said the corners and safeties were in different
coverages on the play. George had also barely gotten onto the field
after Lawyer Milloy, on the previous play, had been inadvertently
hit by Patriots defensive lineman Brandon Mitchell on the helmet
and was dazed.
</P>
<P>
   As often as the Patriots practice in the red zone, they continue
to stumble there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We practice red zone stuff so much. It looks good in practice,
but in the game . . .'' said Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   With New England trailing, 7-3, Ty Law intercepted a Fiedler
pass at the Dolphins' 45 after receiver Ed Perry fell on the seam
between the infield and outfield. Law returned the ball 32 yards to
the Dolphins' 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots tried to run the ball. They handed off to Faulk
four times, then made a first down with an 8-yard pass from Bledsoe
to Troy Brown, before the unthinkable happened. On an inside
handoff to Faulk, linebacker Brian Walker drilled Faulk, forcing
the ball loose. The Dolphins' Zach Thomas recovered it at the 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad mistake,'' said Faulk. ``The most basic thing is
to hold on to the ball, no matter how hard you get hit. I didn't do
that. That really cost us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots went into the two-minute offense late in the half,
but questionable play-calling stalled their drive at the Dolphins'
38. On fourth and 2, the Patriots tried to fool the Dolphins with a
running play. It fooled no one as Faulk was hammered for a 3-yard
loss. This gave the Dolphins the ball and enough time to set up
Olindo Mare's 43-yard field goal with seven seconds remaining,
giving them a 10-3 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of football left. But it could be a lot of
frustrating football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect us to keep fighting,'' said Milloy. ``I'm not
concentrating on the big picture right now. I'm focusing on winning
next week.''

PATRIOTS ARE GETTING GOOD _ AT LOSING 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Just not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing more to say about the first four Patriots games
in a season heading nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins beat the Patriots Sunday, 10-3, at Pro Player
Stadium. Saturday night, Miami coach Dave Wannstedt had told his
team New England would be desperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be like a playoff game for them,'' said Wannstedt.
``They have three losses. They haven't won a game. They have a
tough schedule ahead. If they don't win this one, they know their
chances are over.''
</P>
<P>
   And they are.
</P>
<P>
   As in their first three losses, Sunday's game was winnable for
New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every game this year, the Patriots have been one play away
from winning,'' Wannstedt said Saturday night. ``They had a chance
in all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   They're just not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   Miami has played 16 quarters this year and has given up just one
touchdown, that to a powerful Vikings team in Minnesota. Miami kept
the upstart Ravens out of the end zone last Sunday night, and they
did it to the Patriots Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins prevailed in spite of a sloppy performance. They
had three turnovers after having just three in their first three
games. They had a bunch of penalties, including three that cost
them 110 yards of big offensive plays.
</P>
<P>
   However, they did what they had to do to win.
</P>
<P>
   With Jay Fiedler at quarterback, the Dolphins do not have a
big-play passing game, and they know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take time,'' said Wannstedt before the game,
``but we have to start to get after it soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins won the game on a 53-yard touchdown pass from
Fiedler to Bert Emanuel in the second quarter that came when
Fiedler's scrambling froze the Patriots' secondary for a second,
allowing Emanuel to get behind Kato Serwango at the 10. Emanuel
fell before rolling into the end zone for the score.
</P>
<P>
   Miami treated Bledsoe differently than New England's first three
opponents did. The Dolphins didn't blitz him much, preferring to
play a deep zone, keeping New England from the long bomb. It was
successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had poor field position all day,'' said Wannstedt. ``What
we did well was keep our focus. Our players. Our coaches. We did
what we had to do. New England came up with a good defensive
scheme. They have some talented players on defense. They played a
lot of eight-man fronts and took our running game away from us.
</P>
<P>
   ``A key for us was keeping our players fresh and matching up
with the Patriots on substitutions. The heat was a big factor in
this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, Miami has not lost a game at home in September.
Looking at the weather report Saturday, which predicted the
temperature for the game would be in the 90s, Wannstedt told his
team the night before the game: ``If we have the lead, or if we are
even going into the fourth quarter, we will win. They will be worn
down. Don't let them start fast and get the jump on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Wannstedt and his assistants wanted to know whether Willie
McGinest was going to play for the Patriots. His leg condition had
been downplayed by the Patriots during the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent more time practicing for this game than any other we
had played so far this year,'' said Wannstedt. ``McGinest presents
a unique problem. Because he can play either defensive end or
linebacker, we had to spend a lot of time preparing for that.
Fiedler had to look to see where he was to make the call to the
backs and receivers. Tim Ruddy had to see where he was to call the
blocking assignments for the linemen.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some of the Miami coaches were on the field early
Sunday to see the Patriot assistants work out McGinest to determine
whether his leg was good enough to play. It was not, so the
Dolphins didn't have to worry about McGinest and could play a much
simpler game on offense.
</P>
<P>
   With the temperature on the field heading toward 100 degrees,
the Patriots took precautions against dehydration. Before the game,
any player who had any kind of history of dehydration was hooked up
to an IV, trying an ounce of prevention instead of a pound of cure
at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were prepared for a low-scoring game. The offensive
game plan called for the establishment of a running game, quick
passes to cut down on the possibility of Bledsoe getting sacked,
and ball control to keep the defense off the field in the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Miami turned it over twice, the defense kept New
England out of the end zone. The Dolphins didn't blitz Bledsoe very
much, seemingly confident their fine cornerbacks, Sam Madison and
Patrick Surtain, could contain New England wideouts Troy Brown and
Terry Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us really admire Bledsoe and the way he played and the
way he's been playing,'' said Dolphins lineman Trace Armstrong.
``The guy is really tough. He took some really hard hits out there
and never flinched. He got up slow, but he didn't let it bother
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense is as good as any defense I've ever played on, but
I hope I can say that at the end of the year as well.''
</P>
<P>
   And what did Armstrong think of New England's future?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriots aren't ready to win yet,'' Armstrong said. ``They
have a lot of new players and a whole new coaching staff. With all
those changes, they're not doing the little things that you have to
do to win.''

 &HT;    PAPPAS SCHOOL DEBATE FUELED BY TEST SCORES(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a)

<P>
   (PHOENIX) - Delbert Quavehema is the only kid on the 6:21 a.m.
city bus that takes him from a downtown Phoenix shelter to the
school he attended before he was homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-year-old gets up at 5 every morning and is at school long
before anyone else. But Delbert wants his life as normal as it can
be, what with being evicted this summer and his mother walking out
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Of 75 school-age kids at his shelter, only seven - including
Delbert and his two younger brothers - go to regular public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The rest go to the Thomas J. Pappas School for the homeless,
where they get food, clothing, health care and other help.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Quavehema, the boys' father, opted not to send them to
Pappas for fear they would be stigmatized and their education
suffer. A Hopi Indian, he remembers his own segregated schools.
</P>
<P>
   A new report supports his decision. Homeless kids attending
regular public schools generally do better on a national
standardized test than their counterparts at Pappas, the study
shows, fueling the debate over the state's only school for the
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty
charged that Pappas unfairly segregates kids and should be closed.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional hearing this month brought people from across
the country to Pappas. A bill in Congress would pull federal
funding from schools that segregate homeless kids.
</P>
<P>
   And Maricopa County Superintendent of Schools Sandra Dowling has
been called to Capitol Hill next spring to defend her school.
</P>
<P>
   None of that means anything to Delbert, who just wants to stay
at Loma Linda School in central Phoenix so he can be on the Student
Council and with his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the polite young man with wire-rim glasses and deep
dimples was the second highest ranked student in the fifth grade.
</P>
<P>
   No one teases him about where he lives, though most of the kids
and staff members know.
</P>
<P>
   Delbert eats breakfast and lunch at school, and the staff has
given the boy and his brothers clothes, basketballs and othr
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people here who care about us,'' he said.
``They talk to me and tell me it's going to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   And Delbert believes them. They are, he said, like family.
</P>
<P>
   State Department of Education officials estimate there are as
many as 24,000 kids like Delbert in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   They blend in with other students, wearing discreetly donated
uniforms and shoes. The bus picks them up from motels and shelters
first and drops them off last, so others don't see where they live.
</P>
<P>
   They play sports, march in the band and sign up for Scouting. No
one has to know they are homeless, said Luisa Stark, chairwoman of
the Phoenix Consortium to End Homelessness and founding president
of the National Coalition for the Homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that the children stay in their own school.
There, they can still be Billy Smith or Sally Jones, not just a
homeless child,'' she said. ``They need that stability when
everything else they know is falling apart.''
</P>
<P>
   But Superintendent Dowling said many of the 800 kids at Pappas
have been dragged from one school to another. Some haven't been in
school for months, even years.
</P>
<P>
   And they tell Dowling, she said, that if they couldn't come to
Pappas, they simply wouldn't go to school.
</P>
<P>
   The National Law Center report charges that segregating homeless
kids deprives them because regular public schools offer advanced
classes, music and sports.
</P>
<P>
   No one advocates sending homeless kids to public schools and
letting them tough it out on their own, said Barbara Duffield,
education director of the National Coalition for the Homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Given the proper resources, she said, public schools can provide
the services offered at Pappas.
</P>
<P>
   The Stuart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987 provides
$30 million nationwide for housing, health care and education.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona receives $440,000 annually, but that's only enough for
about 10 of Arizona's more than 400 districts, including charters.
Pappas gets $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pittance,'' Stark said.
</P>
<P>
   Stark suggests turning Pappas into a resource center where all
poor children could go for help but still attend regular public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The state report reviewed scores of homeless children on the
Stanford 9, a standardized test taken annually by kids nationwide.
But the data is only for the districts that receive McKinney
funding, including: Alhambra in Phoenix; Tucson's Amphitheater;
Colorado River Union; Flagstaff Unified; the New School for the
Arts, a Phoenix charter school; Tucson Unified; Yuma Elementary;
Coolidge Unified; and Maricopa County Regional, which runs Pappas.
</P>
<P>
   The report shows that homeless children in these programs did
better on the reading portion of the test this spring than those at
Pappas, though not at every grade level and every school. Districts
were asked to report only reading scores.
</P>
<P>
   Every district except one, for example, did better than Pappas
fifth-graders on reading, scoring at or above grade level.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the 53 homeless fifth-graders in Flagstaff Unified
scored at or above grade level in reading. In Tucson Unified, 22.4
percent of the 187 homeless fifth-graders did as well.
</P>
<P>
   But only 7 percent of Pappas' 75 fifth-graders scored at or
above grade level in reading.
</P>
<P>
   Dowling said it's not fair to compare Pappas kids to the
national average or even to kids in integrated programs who may not
have the same problems with chronic homelessness, substance abuse
and domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   It's more important to Dowling that kids improve from year to
year. She has asked for an independent study of her students'
performance by a local education think tank. It should be done in
January, so she can take it with her to Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to apologize for what we're doing,'' Dowling
said. ``Without us, those kids would have no one.''
</P>
<P>
   Delbert's father used to be a painter but hurt his back and
couldn't work. The boys' mother left them in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   They moved into the shelter when they were evicted from their
apartment. Now, Quavehema plans to go to college and be a
counselor.
</P>
<P>
   He is a gentle man, raising well-mannered boys and constantly
telling them that they are special and loved.
</P>
<P>
   Johnathan, 8, and Elvun, 10, go to Balsz Elementary School near
the United Methodist Outreach Ministries shelter because they are
too little to take the city bus to Loma Linda.
</P>
<P>
   Quavehema said his family will be back on its feet soon enough.
And nothing is more important than keeping the boys in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I feel is best for my children,'' Quavehema said.
``I think they have a better chance of competing in the White man's
world if they have a good education.''
</P>
<P>
   Delbert wants to go to college, maybe be a scientist.
</P>
<P>
   And one day, Delbert hopes, his family can live in a house. It
doesn't have to be fancy, he said - no swimming pool or even his
own room - as long as it's near his school.

 &HT;    ANOTHER YEAR OF BIG LOSSES LIKELY AS COYOTES SALE STALLS(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By CHIP SCUTARI AND HERNAN ROZENBERG(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - The marathon sale of the Phoenix Coyotes could keep
the hockey team at America West Arena for three more seasons,
adding a third year of multimillion-dollar losses for the
debt-laden franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The months have ticked by as developer Steve Ellman works to
nail down his $87 million purchase of the team, setting date after
date for the completion. The latest date: Oct. 15, but it's been a
moving target since June. However, it looks like Richard Burke will
still be the owner when the Coyotes open the season at home against
the St. Louis Blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're firing on all cylinders,'' Ellman spokesman Jeff Hecht
said. ``We're working as hard to get this done as quickly as
possible. We want to get in there, and let Wayne Gretzky put his
stamp on this franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes have played in America West since 1996, saddled with
4,300 obstructed-view seats and limited revenues from luxury suites
and on-ice advertising. Burke claims annual losses between $12
million and $15million.
</P>
<P>
   Ellman wanted to start building a 17,500-seat arena at
Scottsdale's former Los Arcos mall in January, paving the way for
an October 2002 opening. The fastest time a major arena has been
built was 19 months, for the $375 million Staples Center in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The drawn out Coyotes saga has even one of its strongest
supporters on the Scottsdale City Council uttering sighs of
frustration. Councilman Robert Pettycrew says he remains optimistic
Ellman will buy the team and the arena will get built, but not
without help from the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than likely, we're not going to be anywhere done in
December and we'll have to talk about an extension,'' Pettycrew
said, referring to the Dec. 31 expiration date for the stadium
district. ``We had a lot of momentum but the sale of the team has
constantly complicated this project.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellman's arena plan has been pushed back several times because
of the pending sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look they will get in the ground by January,'' said
Gary Roe, Scottsdale's redevelopment director. ``There are some
significant challenges ahead. This is a large case with enormous
public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Roe said the 72-acre project has to pass through an extensive
public hearing process before a vote by the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   Ellman's hurdles include:
</P>
<P>
   He's still trying to convince investors to join his ownership
team. His goal is to raise $100 million. Last Wednesday, Ellman was
in Chicago trying to convince big-money business types to invest
between $3 million and $5 million apiece in the team.
</P>
<P>
   Ellman put out a new investor packet - called an offering
memorandum - after hockey Hall of Famer Wayne Gretzky joined as
part-owner in May. But the new book didn't hit the streets until
August, months after the hoopla over Gretzky's arrival had dimmed.
</P>
<P>
   Ellman also has a public showdown with the Scottsdale City
Council, which is demanding to see his balance sheet. So far,
Ellman has refused to do so, which could further delay the project.
</P>
<P>
   Pettycrew is willing to give Ellman a three- to six-month
extension after December, but he wants the developer to show proof
he has enough money to build a megaplex.
</P>
<P>
   The team's lease at America West Arena expires on Jan. 15, when
an automatic five-year renewal kicks in. Jerry Colangelo, the
America West Arena landlord, has said he'd be willing to extend the
lease for Ellman.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Wellington, chairman of the Los Arcos Stadium District Board
- the group that will oversee the financial plan between Ellman and
the city - said he hopes the council gives the project a reasonable
chance to revitalize an older part of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what happens if the council decides against extending the
district's life beyond Dec. 31, he said: ``Then it's all over. But
I hope they would because the community needs this project. Either
way, I'm going to hang tough and ride it out.''

WITHOUT BETTER EXECUTION, PATRIOTS ARE DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Things are getting better for the Patriots despite
evidence to the contrary. For the first time in three weeks, Drew
Bledsoe at least got to throw the ball on fourth down with the game
on the line instead of having to pick grass out of his face mask
before he got the chance.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the rest of what you are about to read is a familiar
refrain. Close game. Opportunities not capitalized upon. Mistakes
at the worst of times. Victory eluded.
</P>
<P>
   For four weeks now, the Patriots have battled four of the
league's toughest opponents. Each time, the game has come down to
the final moments. Each time, New England has had the ball with a
chance to win or tie.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, it has failed. Despite what the Patriots keep trying
to say, that means they are not good enough to beat those teams
yet. After a while, such results are not an accident. After a
while, they're a trend.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday New England's defense forced three turnovers. Those
turnovers led to 3 lousy points.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, New England's offense penetrated the Dolphins' red zone
twice. Those appearances led to no lousy points.
</P>
<P>
   Result? Dolphins win, 10-3. Patriots' playoff hopes die with
three months to go.
</P>
<P>
   How can anyone say this so early in the season, you ask? How can
the Patriots be out of it at 0-4 when they have lost by an average
margin of barely 5 points a game, you ask?
</P>
<P>
   Easy. Because teams that lose like that, week after week, do it
because they can't help themselves. They can't help themselves
because they aren't good enough to avoid making mistakes when the
pressure is on.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was another example of what is wrong with these Patriots.
When it counts the most, they do the least. When they need a play,
they don't make it _ and not always because of some terrible
mismatch or horrible physical error.
</P>
<P>
   Take the game's two biggest plays Sunday: the touchdown the
Dolphins scored in the second quarter, and the one the Patriots
didn't score at the end of the game, which would have tied things
with 64 seconds to play. Why did those plays go the way they did?
</P>
<P>
   Because that's the kind of team you have at the moment. The kind
that makes those mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   On the first play, safety Lawyer Milloy was forced to run off
the field at the last moment with double vision. Tony George came
in late to replace him and was not in position to help cornerback
Kato Serwanga deep, as he should have in the coverage they were in.
Normally Milloy would have been there, but he was trying to clear
his head after defensive end Brandon Mitchell had inadvertently hit
him so hard on the helmet during the previous tackle for a 3-yard
loss on second and 1 that Milloy's helmet had slid down, slammed
into his nose, and made him woozy.
</P>
<P>
   This is not fiction. These are the facts of life in New England
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a tackle, and Brandon hit me on the top of my helmet,''
Milloy said. ``I got double vision and had to come out. They scored
on the next play. I had plenty of time to refocus after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed Milloy did, because while he was seeing double and George
was seeing no one, Serwanga was seeing Bert Emanuel run away from
him with no safety help for a 53-yard touchdown that ultimately
became the margin of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Why did that happen? Because the safeties, George and Tebucky
Jones, were playing one coverage while the corners were playing
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really being attentive on the sidelines, we got two
different calls,'' George said. ``Kato and the other guys were
playing one coverage and the safeties were playing another
coverage. Tebucky and I made the call, but we missed it. We didn't
communicate out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Stray hit to the helmet. Double vision. Double calls. Double
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a blown coverage,'' coach Bill Belichick said tersely.
``We blew it, and they capitalized on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes they did, just like Tampa Bay, the Jets, and the Vikings
capitalized on such small errors or moments of weakness. A safety
isn't deep when he should be, a receiver gets locked up at the line
of scrimmage when he most needs to get off clean. Small things go
wrong, and you're 0-4.
</P>
<P>
   Barely five minutes after that touchdown, cornerback Ty Law
intercepted a Jay Fiedler pass and returned it to the Miami 21.
Opportunity was knocking. Five plays later, the ball was on the 6
and Kevin Faulk had it in his hands. And then he didn't. End of
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   One second Faulk had it, and the next safety Brian Walker
exploded a shoulder into his face. The ball was on the ground, and
opportunity wasn't knocking anymore. The Patriots' offensive engine
was knocking.
</P>
<P>
   Let us now move on to the game's final moment. Some will pin the
entire loss on it and Bledsoe the way they always do in these
parts, saying the quarterback has to throw a touchdown pass on
fourth down with a minute to play and a chance to tie the game,
especially when for once he is allowed to stay upright from the
start of the play to the finish.
</P>
<P>
   They will say this, but that was not the problem on that play.
The throw was not the problem. The problem was the plays that
preceded it and the fact that tight end Eric Bjornson guessed wrong
about what was going to happen to him when the ball was snapped and
his number called.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Cornerback Patrick Surtain) put his hands on me quicker than
I expected,'' Bjornson said of his late release off the line on a
fade right to the corner of the end zone. ``I wasn't physical
enough at the line of scrimmage. We ran it before and it didn't get
thrown to me, but they played off me a little more so I thought
they'd do it again. I guessed wrong. I was excited about the ball
when it came in. I thought it would have a better result. I don't
know if it was illegal (contact) or not. The guy made a good
play.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, what appeared to be a nearly perfectly thrown ball
fell harmlessly to the ground because Bjornson didn't get enough
separation from the tiny Surtain, who is 5 inches shorter and 48
pounds lighter than the Patriot who wasn't physical enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that situation you want to get your hands on a guy that
big, so I don't know what he was thinking,'' Surtain said. ``That's
a big tight end. I jammed him at the line, and the ball ended up
overthrown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them no tight end is going to catch a pass on me in
that situation. They cursed me out, but that's all right. We got
the W.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Dolphins did.
</P>
<P>
   They got the W because they made the little plays that count.
The Patriots have four Ls because they don't.

<P>
   BOSTON _ If Mike Mussina could sue for non-support, he wouldn't
have much trouble winning his case.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles' veteran righthander has received an average of 3.53
runs per start in his 33 appearances this season, and he has been
backed by three runs or fewer 21 times.
</P>
<P>
   Things weren't any better _ actually, they were worse _ Sunday

Baltimore's one run stand up as the Orioles blanked the Red Sox.

win the game,'' said Mussina, who struck out 15 in his seven
innings of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could pitch that way every single game that's the way I
would pitch every single game, and I'm just lucky I'm able to do it
every once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Mussina's toughest challenge came in his final inning, when
shortstop Melvin Mora booted a potential double-play ball to load
the bases, but Mussina whiffed pinch hitter Midre Cummings and Rico
Brogna to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have taken the double play, rather than the
strikeouts, any time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is the ultimate tough-luck pitcher, Mussina (10-15)
has racked up some impressive individual statistics. He leads the
American League with 231 innings pitched, and he has 203
strikeouts, marking the third time he has topped 200 Ks in a
season.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina has won 19 games twice, with a 19-9 record in 1995 and a
19-11 mark in 1996. He is suffering through his first losing record
since 1991, when he was 4-5.
</P>
<P>
   And Mussina is in position to reap the benefits of his solid
nine-year career. The 31-year-old has spent his entire career in
Baltimore, but he will become a free agent at the end of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need to audition after 10 years. Everybody knows what
I have to offer,'' he said. ``There are teams that are hoping I'm
going to be available in six weeks. I go out and do my job.''

EXCELLENT TROPHY PRESENTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Virginia Tech didn't play last week, which meant
sophomore sensation quarterback Michael Vick didn't get another
chance to solidify his position as early front-runner for the
Heisman Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   The other Heisman hopefuls probably wouldn't declare last week a
chance to impress voters while Vick took a week off. It sure seemed
that way, though.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, Purdue quarterback Drew Brees, ESPN's
preseason pick to win the Heisman. He set Big Ten career records
for completions and attempts Saturday to lead No. 21 Purdue to a
38-24 triumph over Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Brees completed 33 of 49 attempts for 409 yards and 2
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   In his collegiate career, he has 820 completions in 1,325
attempts for 9,487 yards and 73 touchdowns in 36 games.
</P>
<P>
   He topped Big Ten marks of 797 completions set by Jack Trudeau
of Illinois and 1,309 attempts by former Purdue quarterback Mark
Herrmann.
</P>
<P>
   ``We throw the ball so much, those things are going to come,''
said Brees. ``I guess I get more satisfaction from the completions
record because if I'm completing passes I'm doing my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska's Eric Crouch didn't complete as many passes as Brees
in the top-ranked Cornhuskers' 42-13 triumph over Iowa, but he was
as effective and impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Crouch threw just 13 passes, but he completed 10 for 159 yards
and tied a school record with five touchdown tosses in a game.
Consider that he entered having completed 11 of 25 passes for one
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   His previous best for touchdowns in a game was three against
Kansas State in 1998. His exploits would make one believe Nebraska
had abandoned its usual ground game, but the Cornhuskers managed
331 rushing yards against winless Iowa as well.
</P>
<P>
   The trophy is arguably Vick's to lose, with Brees giving the
best chase, although Crouch has bolstered his stock since leading
Nebraska to a thrilling win over Notre Dame in the second week of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Texas Christian running back LaDainian Tomlinson, the
nation's leading rusher, gained 140 yards and scored two touchdowns
as 18th-ranked TCU beat Arkansas State, 52-3.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson, perhaps not as well known as the other Heisman
hopefuls because of the school he attends, had 125 yards at
halftime and didn't play much in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Horned Frogs have won eight consecutive games, their longest
winning streak since 1938 _ the last time TCU won a national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Other Heisman hopefuls didn't fare as well, and some may have
hurt their already slim hopes.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Florida State remains in title contention, Chris
Weinke will remain in consideration. But in the Seminoles' 31-0
triumph over Louisville, he threw three interceptions _ his first
picks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Weinke was effective, completing 18 of 29 passes for
221 yards and a touchdown, while running for a touchdown, too.
</P>
<P>
   Excellence did not appear to be needed from the signal caller,
as the Florida State defense limited Louisville to just 3 yards
rushing on 21 carries.
</P>
<P>
   And Weinke wasn't the only one who had an off game; the teams
combined for 26 penalties for 243 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Miami receiver Santana Moss had six catches for 65 yards but
fumbled a punt that led to West Virginia's opening touchdown. He
also fumbled the ball away after a catch with Miami driving at the
West Virginia 32.
</P>
<P>
   But, like Florida State, Miami wasn't hampered by the miscues.
The 12th-ranked Hurricanes got three scores from their defense in
beating the Mountaineers, 47-10.
</P>
<P>
   Vick, who has followed his exceptional campaign last year with
three impressive outings this season, will showcase his talents
locally this weekend as Virginia Tech plays at Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It has taken 19 games, nearly two seasons, and countless
frustrations, but the State University of New York at Buffalo
finally has justified its Division 1-A status.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo, which upgraded from 1-AA last season, beat Bowling
Green, 20-17, to not only snap an 18-game losing streak but claim
its first win over a Division 1 opponent since beating Holy Cross,
16-0, in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's win comes the week after it lost to Connecticut in a
matchup of the nation's lowest-rated 1-A teams. Before Saturday,
Buffalo's last win was over 1-AA Canisius in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of joy in our locker room,'' said Buffalo
coach Craig Cirbus. ``It was time for our kids to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The win came as Marquis Dwarte ran 27 yards for a touchdown with
1:27 remaining. Bowling Green fell to 0-4.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before the season, many would not have been surprised if this
weekend's Alabama-South Carolina game matched an unbeaten team
against a team with only one win. Few would have figured the
unbeaten team would have been South Carolina, however.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Holtz continues to make believers in South Carolina, which
has won four straight after going winless last season and is ranked
23d in both national polls.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Erik Kimrey threw a 25-yard fourth-quarter touchdown
pass on his first play of the game, lifting South Carolina to a
23-19 victory over No. 25 Mississippi State.
</P>
<P>
   The Gamecocks, who entered the season with a 21-game losing
streak, are 2-0 in the Southeastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Alabama, which was ranked as high as third in the
preseason, is 1-3 after its 28-21 loss to Arkansas. This weekend's
contest will be played in Tuscaloosa, Ala., where the Tide is 0-2
this year. South Carolina is 1-8 against Alabama, however.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joe Paterno is discovering you can prompt as many headlines in
losing a bunch of games as in winning a few. When the season
started, talk abounded that the Penn State coach needed seven wins
to surpass Bear Bryant for the most victories by a major college
coach. Now, with one triumph in five games, you wonder if Joe Pa
will get another win this season. Six Ohio State players scored
touchdowns in a 45-6 victory over Penn State. The loss was
Paterno's worst in his 35 seasons as a head coach. The loss also
gave Penn State its first 1-4 start under Paterno, matching the
school's worst record through five games since 1964 . . . The start
of the Nevada-Wyoming game was delayed because the Nevada team bus
was stuck in traffic behind a 12-car pileup about 10 miles from
Laramie. The team did not arrive at War Memorial Stadium until 6:40
p.m., 20 minutes before kickoff.

IT'S CLOSING TIME FOR RED SOX HOME RUN 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ This may have been Wendell Kim's last memory of Fenway
Park. As he drove out of the players' parking lot in his Toyota,
perhaps the most modest car in a parade of Corvettes, Rolls-Royces,
and Mercedeses, he had to stop momentarily while a police barricade
was moved out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   A husky, middle-aged woman wearing a Red Sox cap and sweat shirt
came right up to the driver's side window, oblivious to the
possibility that the Red Sox third base coach did not need anyone
adding to his suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wendell,'' she bellowed in a voice that could be heard on the
other side of the Tobin Bridge. ``Why'd you send him? You blew
it.''
</P>
<P>
   This was more than an hour after the Red Sox had lost their
final home game of the 2000 season, 1-0, to the Baltimore Orioles,
a game that ended as ignobly as so much that has transpired these
last few days on Yawkey Way.
</P>
<P>
   The bases were loaded with no outs in the bottom of the ninth
when Kim, in yet another act of self-immolation, sent pinch runner
Bernard Gilkey home on a shallow fly to left field. Gilkey was
thrown out easily by Delino DeShields for a rally-choking double
play, and Trot Nixon lifted a routine fly to center field for the
final out of summer in Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the previous two Octobers in the Fens, there will be no
red, white, and blue bunting hung from the box-seat railings, no
milling throngs outside abuzz with the possibility of another trip
to the World Series, no fans huddled in their overcoats deep into
the autumn night, believing in the Olde Towne Team one more time.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Rothstein, the vendor selling programs on Lansdowne Street
before the game Sunday morning, had it right. ``Last call for
baseball,'' he cried.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams didn't take a curtain call _ the suddenness of the
defeat had the Sox ducking into their dugout without so much as a
parting wave _ but there may have been some finality here for the
Sox manager, too. Williams was back in his ``we'll keep it all
in-house'' mode regarding his contretemps with Dan Duquette, which
he had taken public the day before by essentially challenging the
Sox GM to fire him if he wasn't going to back him up.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he was asked if he had thought that this might have been
his last game here as manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no I haven't,'' he said. ``Should I?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the question wasn't exactly far-fetched, someone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In-house,'' he said. ``That's OK. Someday, we'll go have a
soda pop somewhere and I'll talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette wasn't talking about anything in public Sunday. On
Saturday, when he took his case directly to the airwaves, putting
out crocodile assurances of peace with Williams, he ducked
reporters. His spokesman, Kevin Shea, said that Duquette didn't
want to get into a ``tennis match'' with his manager.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, when Duquette wasn't available again, the excuse used by
Shea was that it would not be ``productive'' for the general
manager to speak. Far be it from Duquette to explain to the fans _
who, incidentally, set a home attendance record Sunday _ why his
manager felt betrayed by the GM over his handling of the Carl
Everett situation.
</P>
<P>
   How about the owner, John Harrington? That wouldn't be
``productive,'' either, Shea said, though he said he ``left a
message.'' Why he would have to leave a message for a man who
presumably was sitting in his private box, one level below the
press box, is a question best left to Shea to answer. Perhaps over
a soda pop.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette did make an appearance, however, in the parking lot
after the game. ``Man, why would he show his face?'' one fan said
to his companion, but the dozens of people gathered behind the
barricades neither applauded nor heckled the GM.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette shook hands with Paxton Crawford and Sang Lee, two
pitchers who spent most of the season in Pawtucket. Moments later,
Pedro Martinez appeared in a black sweat suit, and the crowd
erupted in cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette, clad in a windbreaker, talked several minutes with
Martinez, who had a somber expression on his face as they talked.
``Pe-dro, Pe-dro,'' the fans chanted, and he looked away from
Duquette with a big smile and gave a wave. They shook hands, but
before driving away in his white Mercedes with his brother, Ramon,
in the passenger seat, Martinez reached into the back seat for a
couple of Sox T-shirts, which he gave to a woman with a handicapped
child in a stroller. The crowd cheered again, Pedro waved, and then
he and Ramon were gone.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sox clubhouse, as he placed his home white uniform jersey
carefully into a box, Tim Wakefield wondered aloud if he would be
back next season. The day before, Wakefield had been honored as the
Red Sox' nominee for baseball's Roberto Clemente humanitarian
award, for his work with the Franciscan Children's Hospital and
Make-A-Wish Foundation. It was the second time in three years
Wakefield has been nominated for the award.
</P>
<P>
   As capricious as his knuckleball has been, Wakefield has made it
an article of faith to be a part of this community. It saddened
him, he said, to think it might all be coming to an end, if the Red
Sox choose not to pick up the option on his contract for next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of hard to swallow,'' he said. ``I felt this way
last year, too, and I came back. But this is the last year of my
contract. Who knows what's going to happen. But when you've spent
five, six years in the same place, you kind of get used to being
here. The last two years have kind of blurred my vision of retiring
as a Red Sox player.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was so honored to be on the field with the people from
the hospital, and the John Hancock people, and Make-A-Wish people,
and their people telling me, `We hope you come back next year, we
love what you do for us,' and I love doing it. It keeps me
grounded, and it's something I want to do, not something I have to
do. I do it quietly.''
</P>
<P>
   The echoes of the afternoon's cheers and boos had long since
died, and still some fans lingered outside the players' lot. They
had not yet said their final goodbyes.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday morning, Nomar Garciaparra had sat in front of his locker
and admitted that yes, it was true, the wrist he had injured last
September when he was hit by a pitch by Baltimore's Al Reyes still
bothered him a year later. The hamstring? Yeah, that still hurt,
too, as well as who knows how many undocumented aches and pains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of guys in here who are beat up but do whatever
it takes to play,'' said Garciaparra. ``It's something I learned
when I first came here, from veterans who are no longer here.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words, in light of the week's controversy involving
Everett, were not offered lightly. Nothing ever is with
Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   And then, he, too, was gone, his black Jaguar gliding through
the crowd of frantically waving arms and shouted farewells.
</P>
<P>
   It was getting dark. Time to go home. Last call for baseball,
indeed.

EAGLES' EYES SHIFT TOWARD VICK, VIRGINIA TECH 
</HEADLINE>
 COLLEGE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Jonathan Ordway said there was less than a minute
remaining in Boston College's 48-7 rout over Navy Saturday when he
began thinking about the monumental challenge the Eagles will face
this week when they host highly ranked Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' Ordway admitted, ``I probably started thinking
about Virginia Tech with about 10 minutes to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordway, BC's starting junior cornerback, wasn't the only one
thinking those thoughts. As the Eagles rolled up a season-high 625
yards of total offense against the Midshipmen, almost everyone
standing on the Eagles sideline seemed to wonder: Can we step it up
and do this against Michael Vick and the Hokies?
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to look at every game as a big game and next week is
definitely one of the biggest of the season,'' said senior free
safety RaMon Johnson, who will try to keep together an
injury-riddled defense that lost starting linebackers Scott Bradley
and Ryan Burch to knee injuries Saturday and prepare it for the
arrival of Vick and the Hokies, who climbed to No. 4 in both
national polls despite having a week off.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the second-ranked team in the country last year and
are highly ranked this year,'' Johnson said. ``I think it's going
to be a big key for the defensive backfield to play well. We're
putting a lot of pressure on ourselves to practice hard so we can
play well. I'm just hoping that we'll be able to at least contain
Vick, that's the main key.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many teams have, though. Last year, Vick led the Hokies to a
38-14 victory over the Eagles in Blacksburg, Va., completing 11 of
13 attempts for 290 yards and three touchdowns. He showcased his
arm strength when he connected with speedy wideout Andre Davis for
scores of 69 and 59 yards.
</P>
<P>
   So there will be no doubting Vick's ability to go deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, he made a believer out of me and a lot of other players
across the country last year,'' said Johnson, who had the
misfortune of watching Vick rifle the 69-yarder to Davis over his
head. ``You really have to take him seriously when they say he
throws the ball 60, 70 yards in the air. But he will make big
plays. We just have to keep those plays to a minimum and,
hopefully, eliminate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Ordway: ``(Defensive backs) have a clock in their head
sometimes. You'll be running with a receiver and, after a couple of
seconds, you'll be thinking like, `OK, something's happening with
the ball,' so you kind of let up, but you can't do that this week.
You've got to stay with your receiver the whole time.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Eagles must contain Vick with a defense that has
several players among its front seven hurting.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and Burch underwent MRIs Sunday and are awaiting the
results, but are not expected to be ready for Saturday. Both
linebackers suffered sprained knees in the first half when they
were chop-blocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley's injury was something that could've happened to
anybody, it wasn't anything unusual,'' said BC coach Tom O'Brien.
``He got caught sideways and the kid was cutting him. Burch's was a
crackback from the outside by the wingback. The rules say it's a
legal block, but it's marginal as far as I'm concerned. I wouldn't
teach anybody on my team to cut the way they do. It's a tough block
when you get chopped on the knee.''
</P>
<P>
   With junior middle linebacker Andy Romanowsky not in uniform
because of a sprained ankle suffered in last Thursday's practice,
the Eagles had to throw J.D. Schmidt into the breach. Schmidt, a
6-foot-3-inch, 223-pound redshirt freshman from McClean, Va., held
down the fort at middle linebacker by making four tackles (three
solo). O'Brien said Schmidt will back up Romanowsky, who is
expected to return this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're actually asking a lot of J.D right now,'' Johnson said.
``Ryan Burch was moved over from fullback back in the spring to
play at the middle linebacker slot and J.D. didn't quite know he
was going to be tossed into the fire like he was. But I think he
stepped up. We're going to be looking to him and a lot of other
guys like Paul Cook and Lenny Walls to make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   With the status of junior defensive tackle Antonio Garay (knee)
and sophomore linebacker Jerome Ledbetter (knee) still uncertain,
the Eagles can ill afford to suffer any more injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we're running low on linebackers right now,'' Johnson
said. ``I mean, turn around next week and I might be out there.
Hopefully, it won't come down to that.''

   SYDNEY, Australia _ Michael Johnson hopes for no rain on his
parade.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Australian superstar Cathy Freeman each advanced to
the 400-meter dash final despite cool and wet conditions Sunday at
Olympic Stadium in the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about my chances in the final,'' Johnson said. ``I
just hope it's not raining.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and the other seven runners in his semifinal heat were
thoroughly soaked and chilled while standing in the rain during the
awards ceremony for the women's marathon. The world-record holder
wasn't pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was standing in the rain for 15 minutes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Was he cold? ``Yes. Luckily nobody got hurt, so I guess if
didn't affect any of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Pettigrew wouldn't mind a little more precipitation when
the 400 final goes off. Intermittent rain is in the forecast for
the next several days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It think it slows Michael down a little,'' Pettigrew said.
``He can't just take off like he normally does, and I have a chance
to be with him at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Freeman are prohibitive favorites to win gold
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's strongest test figures to come from teammate Alvin
Harrison, who ran the fastest (44.53 seconds) time in Sunday's
semifinals. Freeman's strongest test will be avoiding getting hit
by lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said a record in the 400 ``is always possible, but the
objective is to go in there and win.''
</P>
<P>
   Denise Lewis of Great Britain stuck to her objectives and won
the heptathlon with a modest score of 6,584 points, more than 700
off Jackie Joyner-Kersee's 1988 world record. DeDee Nathan of the
U.S. finished ninth and Shelia Burrell 26th after no-heighting in
the high jump.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. suffered a rare shutout in the men's high jump. Nathan
Leeper finished 11th with a leap of 7 feet, 4 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Sergey Kliugin of Russia won at 7-8. World-record-holder Javier
Sotomayor of Cuba was second. Defending Olympic champion Charles
Austin failed to reach the final.
</P>
<P>
   Naoko Takahashi won the women's marathon in a women's
Olympic-record time of 2 hours, 23 minutes, 14 seconds. She became
the first Japanese female to win a track and field gold medal.
American Christine Clark was 19th.
</P>
<P>
   Tereza Marinova of Bulgaria led an eastern European sweep of the
women's triple jump, and Szymon Ziolkowski won the men's hammer
throw.
</P>

   American hurdlers fared well in qualifying. Terrance Trammell,
Allen Johnson and Mark Crear moved on in the men's 110 highs;

intermediate hurdles; and Sandra Glover and Kim Batten survived in
the women's 400.

JONES' HUSBAND NAMED IN STEROID ALLEGATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Marion Jones, trying to win five gold medals
in track and field, may have run into a major distraction on Monday
when her husband, the shot-putter C.J. Hunter, was accused of
having used a performance-enhancing drug.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Pound, the vice president of the International Olympic
Committee and chairman of its world antidoping agency, said in an
interview on Monday that he had been told by a source he considered
reliable that Hunter had tested positive for a banned substance at
the Bislett Games in Oslo, Norway, on July 28.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Alexandre de Merode of Belgium, the head of the IOC's
medical commission, said on Monday that the IOC had confirmed from
the Olympic-accredited lab in Oslo that an athlete had tested
positive for the steroid nandrolone, in an amount that was 1,000
times as much as the amount that is considered to be of no
performance-enhancing benefit. But Franklin Servan-Schreiber, a
spokesman for the IOC, said the name of the athlete had not yet
been confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Charley Wells, the agent for Jones and Hunter, said that he knew
nothing about any positive test, and he denied the allegations in
an interview with the Reuters news agency. Neither Hunter nor Jones
could be reached for comment on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nandrolone has been easily detectable for years, and it has
puzzled medical officials why a rash of cases involving the steroid
has surfaced this year. One possible explanation is that nandrolone
may be contained in improperly labeled nutritional supplements that
many athletes use, some scientists have said.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Geer, a spokeswomen for the U.S. track and field
federation, declined to comment on an article in The Sydney Daily
Telegraph on Monday that reported that Hunter had tested positive
for both nandrolone and testosterone, the male sex hormone that can
also be used synthetically as a muscle-building steroid. Geer said
the federation, as a matter of policy, did not discuss tests for
performance-enhancing drugs until an appeals process had been
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Masback, the chief executive officer of the American track
federation, did not return telephone calls seeking comment. Dr.
Arne Ljundqvist, an IOC delegate from Sweden and the medical chief
of track and field's international governing body, known by its
initials as the IAAF, said in an interview late Sunday night that
he could not comment on any tests Hunter may have taken.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, who is 31, seemed a certainty to win the Olympic gold
medal at the Sydney Games earlier this season. However, he suffered
a knee injury and underwent arthoscopic surgery, which forced him
to withdraw before the Olympics began.
</P>
<P>
   Jones won the 100 meters on Saturday night and is scheduled to
compete in the 200 meters, the long jump and the 4x100-meter relay
and the 4x400-meter relay. Now she will have to compete with the
distraction of knowing that her husband's career has come under a
drug cloud.
</P>
<P>
   Pound's decision to speak publicly appeared to be motivated by
the IOC's long-held suspicion that the Americans have been covering
up positive doping tests. Masback has vehemently denied that any
tests had been covered up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard that he tested positive in Norway and that the
results were conveyed to the IAAF and USA Track and Field and that
nothing has been done about it,'' Pound said of Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   The issue appeared to be moot for the moment because Hunter was
not competing in Sydney, Pound said. He added, ``I presume everyone
is acting in good faith.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pound said it was important in the fight against doping for the
public to be convinced that drug matters would be handled openly
and expeditiously. Critics of the IOC have contended for years that
the Olympic committee was reluctant to catch cheaters for fear of
losing credibility with the public and corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Ljundqvist, the IOC member from Sweden, said late Sunday that
the IAAF had been concerned that the American track federation had
not reported in a timely manner the results of 12 to 15 suspicious
drug tests involving U.S. track and field athletes dating to the
spring of 1999. Masback has called Ljundqvist's assertions
``absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, the debate involves due process and how it is
interpreted in various countries. Each drug test involves a urine
sample that is split into two parts, known as the A sample and the
B sample. The IAAF, based in Monaco, believes that an athlete
should be suspended and an announcement made public after an A
sample tests positive. The American track federation, however, does
not suspend an athlete or announce a positive test until both an A
and a B sample have tested positive and the athlete has exhausted a
series of appeals that can last for years.

DOLPHINS DEFENDER WALKER KNEW THE DRILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Even for Miami, Sunday was hot, very hot. Bake-oven hot.
</P>
<P>
   Even for professional football, the hit Miami's Brian Walker put
on the Patriots' Kevin Faulk was hard, very hard. Crisply and
efficiently hard. Highlight film hard.
</P>
<P>
   In the bare, unemotional statistics of Sunday's 10-3 win by the
Dolphins, Walker was credited merely with a ``caused fumble.'' In
fact, Walker's hit was so much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know was the lines parted like the Red Sea,'' said
Walker. ``Next thing I know, it was just me and him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins were leading, 7-3, with a little less than four
minutes left in the first half Sunday when the Patriots called a
running play on a second-and-goal from the Miami 6-yard line. Even
with their shambles of an offensive line, the Patriots seemed ready
to dent the Miami defense, which had allowed only one touchdown in
its first three games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   A touchdown at this point by the Patriots might have
dramatically lowered the decibel level at the officially sold-out
Pro Player Stadium (although thousands of fans were wise enough to
stay home and out of the broiling sun). Even more, a TD here would
have given New England the lead, and a Miami offense that seems
even more deficient than New England's might have been hard pressed
to regroup.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe handed the ball to Faulk on an
apparent trap play. Just as Walker, the Miami safety, described it,
the offensive and defensive lines parted like the Red Sea and Faulk
seemed in the clear toward the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Faulk) just broke free. I think they ran a trap play smack up
the middle,'' said Walker. ``And Faulk was running for the end zone
. . .''
</P>
<P>
   As Walker was rushing in from the end zone to stop Faulk, he
said he was thinking, ``I've got to get across his body so he can't
drive his legs and fall forward (into the end zone). Next thing I
know, we got the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   You didn't see the fumble?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know the ball came out,'' said Walker. ``I just hit
him and knew I had got him down and he hadn't gotten a touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker soon realized Faulk had indeed fumbled, teammate Zach
Thomas had recovered, the decibel level at Pro Player Stadium had
soared to jet-engine levels, and his defense _ once again _ had not
allowed a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But Walker's tackle of Faulk seemed almost classic in its
execution. Faulk's fumble was extra, perhaps caused in part by
Faulk's running straight up as well as by the physical force
exerted by Walker on Faulk's body. And when Walker was told his
tackle might make every highlight film of the season _ if not every
instructional tape made by football coaches on how to tackle a
ballcarrier _ the Dolphin smiled . . . and confessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it felt like air,'' said Walker. ``Actually, it felt
like it does in practice, and you're just running by somebody. I
really didn't think I hit him that hard. I guess when you do hit
people the hardest, you really don't feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   Media members were perplexed, if not dumbfounded. One of the
hardest hits delivered in pro football this season, if not many
seasons, felt like Walker was hitting air?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hit him,'' Walker said again. ``It didn't really feel
like I hit him hard. He just went down.''
</P>
<P>
   And Brian Walker's stock went up.
</P>
<P>
   From now on, said the Dolphin, ``when other teams see No. 45 on
the field, they know it's not an easy win coming to them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Kevin Faulk and the Patriots learned, the hard way.

FINAL PLAY, LASTING RESULT FOR PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Even Patrick Surtain wasn't sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there was interference,'' said the Dolphins
cornerback of the Patriots' failed last play Sunday, ``but the refs
didn't call it, so obviously there wasn't. It was a good play.''
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth straight week, New England had a fourth-down play
in the waning seconds to either tie or win a game. This time, the
Patriots came out of their huddle with a fourth and 2 at the Miami
5 with 1:08 left in the game and tried to confuse the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots first lined up in a formation that suggested a run,
only to switch into a wide-open passing formation. Surtain was left
with the responsibility of covering tight end Eric Bjornson on the
Patriots' right side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bjornson is pretty much like a receiver, a receiving tight
end,'' said Surtain. ``And when they changed, we checked into a
spread defense. But I'm out there and my thinking was, `They're
going to go to Terry Glenn, their best receiver.' But I guess they
saw a matchup over there with Bjornson's size (6 feet 4 inches to
Surtain's 5-11), and they tried to get him the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Surtain recalled the contact with Bjornson clearly: ``I jammed
him at the line of scrimmage and I think it was a legal jam, to be
honest with you.'' And there was more contact as the ball was in
flight, Surtain not certain if a flag would fall.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphin after Dolphin said the defense was able to make a quick
read of the Patriots' switch in formations and adjust accordingly .
. . and quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even count how many times we practiced (last week)
against that last play,'' said Miami safety Brian Walker. True
enough, Miami had practiced time and again against New England's
spread formations.
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriots initially lined up with two tight ends and two
backs, a running formation. And when they suddenly spread every
receiver out, leaving Drew Bledsoe ``naked'' in the backfield,
there was initial confusion as the Dolphins rushed to their new
assignments. Miami hadn't seen this sudden switch before.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, only one defender was on the far left where two
receivers, Troy Brown and Terry Glenn, suddenly had sprinted. The
confusion continued, and Surtain was nearly certain the Patriots
would be firing a pass to one of their most dependable receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they go `empty' (nobody behind Bledsoe in the backfield),
we knew the defense we should be in,'' said Walker, who had to
shout out the new assignments. ``So as soon as they came out into
that formation, we made the call and we were on it. Everybody had
to see the (new) formation, but ultimately, it's up to the safeties
to get everybody lined up and make sure everybody's covered.''
</P>
<P>
   The play was run, to Surtain's side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they were trying to use his size to their advantage,''
Surtain said. ``You know, try to throw him a jump ball or whatever.
And I made the play.''
</P>
<P>
   As four straight teams have made against the New England offense
and Bledsoe this season. And even if Surtain later would say he was
able to make that final play ``because the ball was overthrown,''
the play was made.
</P>
<P>
   And no flag was thrown.

WINGER BACK AFTER BATTLE WITH INFECTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ The last two weeks of training camp will be
much better than the first two for Craig Johnson, even if his role
with the Los Angeles Kings remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a speedy third-line winger who ended the regular season
with an impressive showing on the first unit, is returning from a
staph infection in his left ankle that forced him off skates for
more than 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson played both games over the weekend and saw minutes on
the power-play and penalty-killing units. On Saturday against San
Jose in Bakersfield, he played with rookie Steven Reinprecht and
second-year man Jason Blake. Tuesday night against the Sharks at
the Staples Center, he will be teamed with Kelly Buchberger and Bob
Corkum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last few years, (Johnson) has pretty much known what his
role is,'' coach Andy Murray said. ``This year there is a lot of
competition for the job. I think it's good that everything has been
shaken up a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaken up a lot might be more like it. The team has already been
missing center Ian Laperriere, who will be back Tuesday from
reconstructive surgery performed last April on his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   As for Johnson, who had trouble getting his left foot into a
skate last week, a difficult chapter seems to be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting better,'' said Johnson, who was participating in
only his second full workout with the club. ``On the first day of
camp I couldn't skate 15 minutes. Now, I'm in there with the team
and I feel like I can contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's problems began in early August after taking his family
to San Diego. It was a day off from his regular workouts, but he
awoke in the middle of the night to find redness and swelling from
his ankle to his knee. The next day, doctors made an incision
across the inside of the ankle to let it drain and found an
infection.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 28, was placed on antibiotics. Several days later,
doctors removed a bursa from the ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed is such a big part of his game,'' Murray said. ``We just
had to wait to see how it would play out.''
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks, Johnson did nothing. But his conditioning level
was so good before the injury he was able to participate in
noncontact drills within a month. Now, the Kings are hoping he can
carry the momentum of last season into this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was freaky and it happened at a very inopportune time,''
Johnson said. ``It felt good to contribute the way I did at the
end. I got to play with some really great people. But right now the
most important is just playing. I have a good feeling everything
will be OK.''

THREE-RUN HOME RUN LIFTS U.S. IN THE 10TH 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKTOWN, Australia _ Stacey Nuveman turned her aluminum bat on
a low inside pitch on Monday afternoon. After nearly 10 innings of
almost flawless work on the mound, Yanqing Zhang's arm had grown
weary.
</P>
<P>
   The ball left the New South Wales Softball Center in a blink. It
was a towering three-run shot just inside the left-field foul pole
and it gave the United States a pulsating 3-0 victory in its
Olympic semifinal game against China before a near-capacity crowd
of 8,157.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the first leg of the United States women's softball
redemption tour was complete. Under gray clouds and at times a
drizzle, the Americans indeed lived to play another game.
</P>
<P>
   Team USA was scheduled to meet Australia in an elimination game
on Monday night at 7:30 p.m. The winner will meet Japan in the gold
medal game on Tuesday night. The Japanese beat Australia, 1-0, in
the other semifinal when Keika Utsugi drilled a homer for the
game's only run in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The United States won 112 straight games before they stunningly
lost three straight in the tournament. Sandwiched around a 2-0 loss
to China in 14 innings were losses to Japan, by 2-1 in 14 innings,
and Australia, by 2-1 in 13 innings, on a shocking two-run home run
that ended the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to get it done in dramatic fashion, but base hits
work as well,'' said Nuveman, who went 2 for 4 on Monday. ``We've
just got to keep chugging along until we get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Nuveman ended the drama on Monday with her bat, but not before
the United States' arms gave her the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   With two out and Xiaoling Deng of China at third base in the top
of the 10th inning _ the rules call for a player to be inserted at
second base to begin each inning after the ninth _ Christa Williams
froze Yanghong Yu of China on a 3-2 pitch. She sneaked a slow riser
past the Chinese right fielder, pumping her fist as she skipped to
the dugout to meet her pumped-up teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans kept bailing themselves out, if not with pitching,
then with superb defense. Williams, who relieved Michele Smith, was
in trouble in the top of the ninth inning with runners on first and
second. Yet a sparkling double play ended the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who left the game after eight innings after having
allowed 5 hits and no walks with 10 strikeouts, pitched better when
she was in danger. After Xia Mu doubled just inside the left-field
foul line in the top of the fourth inning, Smith struck out Jian Xu
and Fang Yan to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Yanqing pitched well, too. She faced 35 batters, allowed 3 hits
and struck out 8 before she faced Nuveman. The tournament leader in
strikeouts with 37 coming into the game, she windmilled through the
American lineup for most of the day. But in the 10th inning, she
walked Sheila Douty. With Jennifer Brundage already on second to
start the inning, Nuveman drove the 2-1 pitch high and deep over
the left-field fence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beyond her game-winning blast, Nuveman, the catcher, was also
the Americans' most valuable player on defense. Twice she threw out
runners at first base who were napping between pitches, completely
catching the Chinese off guard and motivating her teammates. &QL;

WEIGHING PROS AND CONS OF WEIGHTLIFTING 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ It's too bad, really. Weightlifting really is pretty
good spectator fun.
</P>
<P>
   What these people _ I was going to say ``guys'' before I caught
myself _ do is astonishing. They lift the equivalent of
refrigerators and compact cars and pairs of NFL offensive linemen
over their heads, and they often do it with flair. You should have
seen Cuban Michel Batista smugly turning his head left and right
while holding 177 kilograms (390 pounds) aloft during the snatch
portion of his competition in the 94 kg (207 pounds) class Sunday.
That was pretty cool.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches are an amusing sideshow, urging their athletes in
extremely vocal fashion while everyone else in the hall remains
silent. The music is good. They keep things moving. You get in and
out within two hours per session. There are many far less
entertaining ways for a curious and open-minded Olympic
ticket-holder to spend part of an afternoon or evening.
</P>
<P>
   However . . .
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that we can't be sure what we're seeing is on the
up-and-up. It has been a very turbulent week for one of the charter
Olympic sports. The national teams of Romania and Bulgaria have
been ejected, although Romania had legal option to pay a $50,000
fine and get back in. (Don't ask.) Medals, including one gold, have
been stripped. Reputations have been stained and great offense has
been taken. It is, of course, the same old, same old. The question
before the panel is, ``Can there ever be a drug-free weightlifting
competition?''
</P>
<P>
   The most realistic answer is ``Probably not.'' The same question
can be posed for such Olympic staples as swimming (you think
everybody believes Inge de Bruijn just got some kind of training
boost?), athletics (i.e. track and field), and cycling. The ability
to create useful drugs and, more important, to hide them, is better
than the ability to detect them.
</P>
<P>
   But as suspect as some performances in the other three sports
may be on occasion, the fact is that the sport in which athletes
are continually getting their paws caught in the kitchen cookie jar
is weightlifting. It's been this way since the early 1980s, and, as
the tumultuous events here in Sydney have reminded us, nothing has
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the International Weightlifting Federation have a
genuine concern; namely, to ensure its sport's continued presence
at the Olympics. IWF vice president Sam Coffa went on record this
week as saying that ``Unless we can show them (the IOC) we can take
control of the situation, I would accept our place in the Olympics
movement as in jeopardy. If we don't accept that, we've got rocks
in our head.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it seems the situation would be resolved if Bulgaria
would just go away. Bulgaria is to weightlifting what San Pedro de
Marcoris is to shortstops. When Bulgarians aren't winning medals
for the mother country, expatriate Bulgarians are winning them for
someone else. Why Bulgaria, as opposed to, say, Romania or Hungary?
I've never gotten a clear answer on that one.
</P>
<P>
   But Bulgaria it is, and it came as no surprise to anyone when
women's 58 kg gold-medal winner Izabela Dragneva and men's 56 kg
silver-medal winner Ivan Ivanov, Bulgarians both, were stripped of
their medals when doping tests found them positive for the diuretic
``furosemide.'' Such diuretics are banned because, while ostensibly
used to aid in weight reduction (always a concern in this sport),
they also do a very nice job of masking the presence of anabolic
steroids.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the snickers in the weightlifting community when it was
announced Friday that two members of the Qatar weightlifting team,
all eight of whom are Bulgarian natives for whom the Qatar
government paid $1 million to Bulgaria for their services, would
not be able to compete in the men's 77 kg class due to the onset of
``diarrhea.'' The official explanation was that the two had dined
poorly outside the athlete's village and paid some horrible medical
price. We are free, under the circumstances, to believe something
else. And most people do.
</P>
<P>
   The IWF says it's trying. ``We try to do everything to educate
and train our competitors and coaches,'' insists general secretary
Dr. Tamas Ajan. ``Last year we had 1,163 competitions and only 18
positive cases. We really fight against drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   That may very well be true, but facts are facts, and the reality
is that medals were lost this week due to drugs and this cannot be
good for the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Dr. Ajan keeps saying that we really should be speaking of
this matter in the past tense. ``The last 24 years the IWF has had
a strong struggle against drugs,'' he says. ``Fortunately, or
unfortunately, from those 24 years, in the first 14 the IWF has had
a strict control problem. Some people thought weightlifting was
another name for drugs and drugs another name for weightlifting. In
the past 10 years weightlifting is in a different position. It's
not the No. 1 sport for drug problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, really? No other sport has had a week to rival
weightlifting's. No other sport has had two major federations
thrown out of the competition. No other sport has had to provide
do-over medal ceremonies in the athlete's village.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody needs this, least of all the Australian Olympic
Committee, which needs everyone to think well of all this
competition. Says AOC vice president John Devitt, ``We are proving
every time we will take the opportunity to get rid of cheats. We
don't want cheats in the competition, and it's great to see rules
in place to remove people who should not be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Mr. D. There's only one way to ensure that a cheat won't
win an Olympic weightlifting competition: Don't have any.

GOLDEN NUGGETS FROM SYDNEY 
</HEADLINE>

 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ ``What's it like there?''
</P>
<P>
   I am starting my third week down under at the Stealth Games, the
Olympics many of my fellow Americans back home have chosen to
ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Response to our work here is minimal. Phone messages and e-mail
are not pouring in from all corners of New England. Baseball
pennant races, NFL, college football, back-to-school carpooling,
and NBC's tape delays necessitated by the hideous 15-hour time
difference have conspired to hide these great Olympics from the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   But in those rare moments when a Saturday morning phone call
from Australia interrupts a busy Friday night in the States,
friends and family ask one question about the Stealth Games:
</P>
<P>
   ``What's it like there?''
</P>
<P>
   It's like this . . .
</P>
<P>
   Weather. Two weeks of sunny, dry, and 75 hint that Sydney in
September might be as good as it gets. It started to get windy and
rainy Sunday, but it's been near perfect 90 percent of the time.
Days are shortsleeve-warm, nights are sweater-cool. There's almost
no humidity, usually a fresh breeze. Think San Diego times
infinity.
</P>
<P>
   The train system works with precision. Rail cars are clean,
climate-controlled, and on time. Volunteers steer Olympic
ticket-holders in and out of the cars and get them to the venues.
It's going to be rough getting back on the T after three weeks of
Sydney trains.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney's greatest tourist attraction is its population. There
are 47,000 nonpaid Olympic volunteers and each one seems to have a
smile and a kind word. Not always able to help, the volunteers are
unfailingly polite and cheery, even when dealing with impatient
journalist galoots from the United States (some might find it
interesting that the press village rests on the site of a former
insane asylum).
</P>
<P>
   The locals are buoyant, reveling in the success of their
athletes and especially proud of the rave reviews they've gotten
for hosting these Games. Coming on the heels of the Richard
Jewell/Coca-Cola Games in Atlanta, the contrast is striking.
</P>
<P>
   Many pubs are open until 6 a.m. (I have not tested this, but am
assured it's true) and have great names like ``Agincourt,''
``Fortune of War,'' and ``Hero of Waterloo.'' The nightlife uniform
for young women _ most of whom have curly hair _ seems to be
hip-hugger black stretch pants.
</P>
<P>
   It would appear that smoking is not an option: If you don't
smoke, they might throw you out of a joint. However, Australia's
tobacco lobby doesn't have much clout. A pack of smokes comes with
a huge warning displayed more prominently than the brand name:
CIGARETTES CAUSE HEART DISEASE or SMOKING KILLS.
</P>
<P>
   An American is struck by the complete lack of cynicism in the
local newspapers. Typical headline feting Aussie swimmers in
Sunday's Sun-Herald: ``We Will Not Forget You.'' In Sydney, the
Patrick Ewing trade was the ``Luc Longley Deal.'' Typically, the
local tabloid was first to snap exclusive photos of Meg Ryan
cavorting with homeboy Russell Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   It's not considered rude to interrupt conversations. If you
overhear something that strikes you, just jump in with an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   There must be local crime, but the only time I saw a policeman
running was when he was scampering into a pub to catch the finish
of a swim relay in which the Aussies were going for gold.
</P>
<P>
   There are few options on local television and one station,
mighty Channel 7, is keeper of the Olympic flame. Three out of
every four Sydney TVs are tuned into 7. Every athlete talks to
Channel 7. Some athletes work for the station. Former Muhammad Ali
opponent Joe Bugner works for 7. Typing in my room one night, I was
distracted by a sports anchor with an unusual accent and looked up
to see Nadia Comaneci reading the scores.
</P>
<P>
   Only a couple of sports bars carry ``Monday Night Football,''
which is aired live Tuesday at noon.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic Park is wall-to-wall humanity and there's always a line
snaking outside the official souvenir store. (I'm coming home with
kangaroo jerky. I hear it travels well.) The most popular photo
pose involves lining yourself up so the Olympic torch is in your
background, then raising your right arm and having your friend snap
the picture to make it look like you are holding the torch.
</P>
<P>
   Kangaroos are boomers and shrimp are prawns. Fruits and veggies
are not important. Foster's gets all the publicity, but VB,
Carltons, and Tooheys Old (not to be confused with Tooheys New) are
favorite beers. They have a $2 coin that feels like a New York
subway token. Our dollar is strong and Yankee tourists are buying a
lot of stuff.
</P>
<P>
   American culture is everywhere. ``Judge Judy'' and
``Entertainment Tonight'' are on TV. ``Big Momma's House'' and
``Scary Movie'' are playing at the cinema. Across the street from
my hotel there's McDonald's, Burger King, and Subway. When ``Hotel
California,'' _ a staple of American classic rock _ plays in a pub
jukebox, all the locals know the words.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney is a little like the Hotel California. You can check out
any time you like, but you can never leave. Memories of this
wonderful town will stay with those of us who were here long after
the Stealth Games are over.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; SYDNEY, Australia _ I want to celebrate the Olympics. I want to
write about hurdler Glory Alozie's courage in competing two weeks
after her fiance was struck and killed by a car here.
</P>
<P>
   I want to record the rapture on sprinter Marion Jones' face when
she crossed the finish line and realized she's living her girlhood
dream here.
</P>
<P>
   I want to believe that if you keep banker's hours at the pool
and in the weight room and at the aerobics studio you can cash in
like swimmer Inge de Bruijn did here.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to doubt Inger Miller when she says she has a
hamstring injury and Regina Jacobs when she says she has a viral
infection and Marie-Jose Perec when she behaves as though she's a
woman on the verge of a breakdown and C.J. Hunter when he says knee
surgery kept him from throwing here.
</P>
<P>
   I want to revel in the human condition, not be revolted by it.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bulgarian weightlifting team won't let me.
</P>
<P>
   A Romanian rower won't let me.
</P>
<P>
   The Uzbekistan track-and-field trainer won't let me.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese won't let me.
</P>
<P>
   Every new drug cheat outed here chips away at the Olympics'
glossy veneer. Pretty soon it's going to be all over, except for
the hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it already is.
</P>
<P>
   If the Olympics can be bought at any cost, why shouldn't
athletes want to win at any price?
</P>
<P>
   Today dawned dark and cloudy for Olympic romantics. ``The Sydney
Daily Telegraph'' dropped a bomb on Olympic Millennium Park. It
reported that Hunter, the reigning world champion in the shot put
and Jones' husband, tested positive for the steroid nandrolone,
hastening his withdrawal from these Games.
</P>
<P>
   The IAAF later today confirmed: Hunter didn't have a knee
problem; he had a pee problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Hunter story quickly grew legs and took off like Maurice
Greene.
</P>
<P>
   Lord knows it's going to be no small distraction for Jones, who
is trying to become the first woman in track and field to win five
gold medals in a single Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   At the Atlanta Olympics four years ago, Irish swimmer Michelle
Smith aroused suspicion because her husband, Erik de Bruin, had
been banned from competing internationally in the discus because of
a failed drug test.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this guilt by association would later become guilt by
administration when one of Smith's drug tests was found to have
been tampered with.
</P>
<P>
   The sad truth is it no longer takes a tainted drug test to
besmirch a reputation.
</P>
<P>
   I want to believe Jones is different. In my heart, I hope she's
purer than spring water. But my head is spinning.
</P>
<P>
   The mere hint of scandal is a disgrace to U.S. track. The
sport's national governing body already is reeling from accusations
by Arne Ljungqvist, the chief anti-doping official of track and
field's international governing body, that U.S. track bigwigs have
withheld information on up to 1 dozen positive tests over the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Anything to grow the sport, I guess. Hypocrisy, thy name is
U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   Who cares if athletes are ingesting stuff that makes their jaws
jut out and their blood vessels constrict and their hearts enlarge
when there's a cash cow to be milked?
</P>
<P>
   Every new doping allegation is disastrous for the other athletes
competing here, none of whom is fast enough or strong enough to
avoid the fallout.
</P>
<P>
   Track and field may be a sport of individuals, but those who
truly love it bear a collective responsibility to clean up the
sport the way Olympic organizers, in concert with
environmentalists, did Homebush Bay in preparation for these 27th
Summer Games:
</P>
<P>
   With a sound blueprint, lots of money and a deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Games are sanitized, all the compelling human interest
stories will inevitably take a backseat to human growth hormone and
the like.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I could have used this space to describe Alozie's first
race since the death of her 22-year-old fiance Hyginus Anayo Anugo.
How the Nigerian blasted out of the blocks, as though propelled by
some invisible force, and won her heat to advance to the
quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Alozie said she was powered by God's grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``God is my strength,'' she said. For the sake of the Olympics,
I found myself praying she was telling the whole truth.

DUCKS BEAT SHARKS IN PRACTICE GAME
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Antti Aalto, from Paul Kariya and Teemu
Selanne?
</P>
<P>
   No, that's not anywhere close to what the Anaheim Mighty Ducks
envisioned as a consistent scoring combination as recently as two
days ago.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to the broken left hand of top line center Steve
Rucchin, the 25-year-old Aalto is getting his chance to play with
the big boys.
</P>
<P>
   And Aalto, overcoming an admitted case of early nerves, didn't
disappoint his new linemates as the center wristed home the
game-winning goal with 29 seconds remaining to lift the Ducks to a
2-1 exhibition victory over the San Jose Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   An announced crowd of 10,151 at The Pond on Sunday watched Aalto
streak down the middle of the ice in an attempt to keep up with the
speedy Kariya, who was on his right. Kariya slid a pass perfectly
onto Aalto's stick and he promptly lifted the puck over San Jose
goalie Johan Hedberg's right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was looking for a give-and-go, but he shot it,'' Kariya
smiled. ''It's good for his confidence to have success right
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Aalto, whose winner was assisted by both Kariya and Selanne, had
been struggling to get ice time with the depth at center more
evident now with the free agent acquistion of German Titov.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is good for a young guy like me to play with two of the
best players in the league,'' Aalto said.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg, once he learned that Rucchin's
injury could keep him sidelined for a month, discussed options with
his coaching staff on whom to replace Rucchin on potentially one of
the NHL's most lethal lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''He does a lot of the same things that Rucchin does and I
didn't want to change around the other lines,'' Hartsburg said.
''Antti fits the mold of the player who usually plays there. He's
played in World Championships before (for Finland), so he knows how
to handle pressure. I liked some of the things he did tonight. We
will try him there again.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Aalto: ''I was a little nervous at first. But I just had
to settle down and play my game.''
</P>
<P>
   While playing along side Kariya and Selanne can be intimidating
because of their skill level, Kariya added, ''Teemu and I aren't
the kinds of guys who will scream at you if you make a mistake,
Antti knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks made it three straight preseason wins (after starting
with three successive losses) as the defensive effort limited San
Jose to just 18 shots (including a 12-minute stretch of no shots).
</P>
<P>
   ''The challenge was trying to stay awake and stay mentally
focused,'' said goalie Guy Hebert, who stopped 17 shots. ''I think
I've played with 10 defenders in two games and the shot totals (24
by the Kings on Friday) have been low. It's a great feeling back
there knowing that you have 10 guys who can do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Matt Cullen scored a power-play goal with one second left
in the second period to tie the game for the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That goal should send a message to our power-play unit (the
first line of Selanne, Kariya and Jonas Ronnqvist struggled Sunday)
that if you keep working and stay persistent, good things will
happen,'' Hartsburg said. ''It doesn't have to be pretty (Cullen's
score came when he stayed after his own rebounded shot in front).''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NBC's best Olympic Games coverage isn't on television. If you've
watched any of the network's prime time shows, you probably knew
that.
</P>
<P>
   The network's best Olympic work is taking place on the Internet,
and while there's no video, at least it's live.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the network's investment in the 2000 Olympics from
Sydney, it set out to produce its own Web site, NBCOlympics.com, as
an adjunct to its TV coverage. The result is a gleaming site with
personality that is both timely and deep in content.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is held from the Web site. Results of events are posted
as soon as they are official. A trip to the site Sunday morning
would have given you the results of every event the TV network held
until its prime time show Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   There, you could have read about Laura Wilkerson's win in the
women's platform diving, including complaints by Chinese divers
about the scoring, and about the report that shot putter C.J.
Hunter, the husband of Olympic 100-meter gold medalist Marion
Jones, tested positive for steroids at a track meet in July, an
interesting development considering he pulled out of the Olympics
because of a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the Judo section of the site  &UR; _ &LR;  there are sections
for every site, complete with a photo gallery and archives
 &UR; _ &LR;  would have also informed you that an Aussie competitor had
questioned the gender of a Brazilian named Edinanci Silva, who
happens to be a hermaphrodite.
</P>
<P>
   Now if ever a story deserved prime time exposure, that's it.
Where's Jim Gray when you really need a probing interview?
</P>
<P>
   Tom Feuer, the coordinating producer for NBCOlympics.com, was
given a two-pronged mandate by NBC Sports President Dick Ebersol.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we wanted to enhance the broadcasts by going deeper and
richer into stories and events,'' he said. ``For example, as good
as Cynthia Potter is as a TV analyst, but we can do even more with
her knowledge, like breaking a dive into all of its elements, on
the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV coverage can only process so much information about a
single race, like the women's 400 with Cathy Freeman. On the Web
site, we have bios of everyone she's running against.''
</P>
<P>
   The second point was to make the site competitive. NBC may have
a hammerlock on the TV coverage, but nothing stops Web sites from
providing instantaneous results and perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very good (Web) competitors out there in ESPN,
CNNSI, USA Today and SportsLine,'' Feuer said, ``sites people are
used to going. We wanted to have a site that would force people to
bookmark us because we were so good.''
</P>
<P>
   Gee, if only NBC Sports President Dick Ebersol was as aggressive
in the TV coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Leading Internet sitemaker Quokka designed the look of the Web
site, but Feuer sketched out all of its content. He came to the job
with the enthusiasm of a former distance runner who has been around
the Olympic movement for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   A Palisades High and UCLA graduate, Feuer joined the Santa
Monica Track Club after high school so he could continue running
competitively. He eventually became the club's publicist; it needed
one, since Olympic hero Carl Lewis was its most famous member.
</P>
<P>
   Feuer worked in media relations for the L.A. Olympic Organizing
Committee in 1984, then joined NBC's Olympic staff. He was an
associate producer in Seoul for track in 1988, produced track
coverage for the ahead-of-its-time Triplecast in 1992, and produced
field event coverage in Atlanta four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He had no hands-on Internet experience when NBC asked him to be
coordinating producer for the Web site in January of 1999. What he
did have was an understanding of news and content and an idea of
what a visitor to a Web site might want.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to tell stories from the inside out, give visitors a
chance to hear directly from the athletes,'' he said. ``Quokka gave
us a look and we have access to all of the rich visuals from the
network. We've also taken advantage of our partners (like MSNBC) to
add more to the site.''
</P>
<P>
   Feuer's staff includes 101 people in Sydney and 235 more in San
Francisco. Content comes from MSNBC, the Associated Press, NBC
on-air analysts like Mike Dodd, Chris Marlowe (volleyball) and
Dwight Stones (track), and a staff of freelance writers. Feuer says
its not unusual for former UPI reporter William Murray to crank out
30 stories in a day's time.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of Web coverage has helped NBCOlympics.com and
underscored a developing trend. With NBC having an exclusive lock
on video, competing broadcast sources like ESPN have treated the
Olympics like back page news, and that attitude has filtered down
to the Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, opening Web pages on ESPN.com, Foxsports.com and
SportsLine.com have been devoted to football. SportsLine.com's site
opened to the headline, ``Shut up and play,'' on Sunday's Jets-Bucs
game featuring ex-USC star Keyshawn Johnson. Only CNN/SI, due in
large part to Sports Illustrated's emphasis, has been
Olympic-centric.
</P>
<P>
   The official Olympic site (Olympics.com, operated by IBM) also
has a lot of detail  &UR; _ &LR;  live bridgecam and blimpcam shots from
Sydney and bios of every athlete from every country
 &UR; _ &LR;  but it's more generic in nature. While a visitor to any of these
sites could keep abreast of anything happening in Sydney, there's a
lot more depth at NBCOlympics.com.
</P>
<P>
   And it's live, too.

MIGHTY DUCKS NOTEBOOK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK WELCH  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Anaheim Mighty Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg has
consistently said throughout training camp that, ``this is a
different team (this season). We feel we've got more depth. We're
better equipped. We have more depth up front.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Hartsburg or the Ducks wanted it this way, but for the
next month, that depth will be put to its first major test.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim took the ice for the first time against the San Jose
Sharks on Sunday at The Pond without top line center Steve Rucchin.
</P>
<P>
   Rucchin suffered a broken left hand during Friday's 3-2
preseason win over the Kings. He is expected to be out of action
for about a month, which means he will miss Anaheim's final two
preseason games and perhaps as many as the first 10 regular season
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the one thing we didn't want to see happen,'' Anaheim
right wing Teemu Selanne said. Selanne and Paul Kariya play wing
spots on the top line centered by Rucchin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was together. There were no missing players.
Everybody was healthy and now this. It's a tough break, but the
other guys are going to have to step up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks lost Rucchin to an ankle injury last year for an
11-game stretch. The club was in the throws of a 2-10-2 stretch at
the time. Rucchin had 19 goals and 57 points in 71 games last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Center Antti Aalto, who before Friday was in a battle with
fellow centers Andy McDonald and Tony Hrkac to just make the club,
found himself Sunday with the first crack at centering the top
line.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will evaluate the situation every day,'' Hartsburg said.
''He (Aalto) is a big strong guy. He's good defensively. He works
hard. He'll go to the net and he'll created loose pucks. Are we
expecting him to be a Steve Rucchin? No. We're expecting Antti
Aalto just to play his game.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Rucchin also means that Jonas Ronnqvist, a
fourth-round draft pick this past summer, moves up -- for the time
being -- to the top power-play line with Selanne and Kariya. Center
German Titov also appeared with Kariya and Selanne on the No. 1
power play line.
</P>
<P>
   __ Defenseman Ruslan Salei made his preseason debut on Sunday
against the Sharks. Salei missed the first five games with a sore
hip.
</P>
<P>
   __ Ducks goalie Guy Hebert made his second straight start in
goal against San Jose. Hebert missed some time earlier in training
camp with a groin muscle problem.

LONG WAY FROM WILSON HIGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia &UR; _  &LR; Moments after the Yugoslavians had battered
the United State men's water polo team 8-5 Sunday afternoon, Tony
Azevedo reflected on the dramatic upgrade in competition he has
faced during the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a long way from Wilson High,'' said the 18-year-old
Azevedo, the youngest member on the American squad who graduated
from the Long Beach high school only last June. ``I faced a lot of
guys around 5-9 when I was in high school, but everyone here is
well over six feet and everyone is strong and tough. I knew it was
going to be physical, but not quite this physical.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavians would say afterward that last year's bombing of
their country by the United States was not on their minds during
the match, but they performed with a relentless ferocity against
the Americans throughout the 28 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   No one wearing USA caps ever was in trouble of drowning, but a
lot of guys were unceremoniously dunked during a game when a
gentleman named Aleksandar Sapic scored four goals for the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   This didn't turn out to be like the famous 1956 water polo brawl
at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics between the Hungary and the Soviet
Union, which had invaded Hungary a few months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   There were no punches thrown among the rival players, and the
crowd was peaceful with about an equal number of people waving
American and Yugoslavian flags.
</P>
<P>
   The Long Beach-dominated American team_ Azevedo, Ryan Bailey,
Chi Kredell and Robert Lynn are natives and Kyle Kopp performed at
Long Beach State, as did Kredell_ is now 0-2 in the tournament, but
still can advance to the next round if it can win two of its next
three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been good for us that we've already played two of
the toughest teams in this tournament,'' said the U.S. coach, John
Vargas, whose team was beaten 10-7 Saturday by Croatia. ``These
games will prepare us for our upcoming ones. We're not going to
face more physical teams than Yugoslavia and Croatia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans figure to pick up a victory today against a weak
Netherlands team, although their goalkeeping is going to have to
improve drastically if they expect to medal.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Serbian players who roughed up Americans all over the
pool, Vladimi Vujasinovic, certainly wasn't impressed with the work
of Dan Hackett, who already has been violated for 18 goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American goalie is not very good,'' he said told
Yugoslavian journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Azevedo wound up with a goal_ he now has two_ and afterward
insisted the American team will get better in the upcoming days.
</P>
<P>
   If it doesn't, its stay here will be a brief one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we played a lot better today than we did in our
opener against Croatia,'' he said. ``We just have to tighten up our
defense and do better on 6-5 (a man advantage) situations.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team was idle the first Olympic week, and Azevedo said
much of his time was taken up by training.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you practice twice a day, it doesn't leave a lot of time
for sightseeing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he has been enjoying the Olympic experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food at the village has been tremendous,'' he said. ``You
have all sorts of ethnic foods to choose from_ American, Chinese,
Indian, Japanese, Mexican.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've also got to know some of the famous athletes. Marion
Jones came over and sat in front of our housing complex one day,
and we spoke about 30 minutes. It was very interesting. I also met
Lindsay Davenport and Monica Seles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a lot of fun, but right before we started playing
volleyball I said to myself, Tony, you're not here to meet people
and to rock and roll. Now it's time to get serious.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Azevedo's parents_ his father Ricardo is the Long Beach State
water polo coach_ are here, as are most of the parents of the water
polo players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to support the team, and to have a little fun,''
said Dan Bailey, the veteran Long Beach State athletic trainer
whose son is Ryan Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans didn't have much fun Sunday against the
Yugoslavians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we're aware of the war we had with America and
heard first hand the bombs that dropped on our country,'' said
Aleksandar Sapic, who was the best player in the pool. ``But we
don't think about that when we're playing. We're all sportsmen out
there because this is the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing in the Olympics is something I've dreamed of doing
since I was a kid,'' said Tony Azevedo. ``I just never thought I'd
be doing it even before I enrolled in college. But I'll be enjoying
this experience a lot more once we start winning some games.''

HUNTER SAID TO TEST POSITIVE FOR STEROIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout) 
By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia - Marion Jones, trying to win five gold medals
in track and field, ran into a major distraction on Monday when her
husband, the shot-putter C.J. Hunter, was identified by track and
field's international governing body as having tested positive for
a performance-enhancing drug.
</P>
<P>
   Istvan Gyulai, the general secretary of the International
Amateur Athletic Federation, track and field's governing body, said
on Monday that Hunter had tested positive for the banned steroid
nandrolone at a competition in Oslo on July 28.
</P>
<P>
   Gyulai's statement came after Dick Pound, the vice president of
the International Olympic Committee, said in an interview on Monday
that he had been told by a source he considered reliable that
Hunter had tested positive for a banned substance at the Bislett
Games in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Alexandre de Merode of Belgium, the head of the IOC's
medical commission, said on Monday that the IOC had confirmed from
the Olympic-accredited lab in Oslo that an athlete had tested
positive for the steroid nandrolone, in an amount that was 1,000
times as much as the acceptable limit.
</P>
<P>
   Charley Wells, the agent for Jones and Hunter, said that he knew
nothing about any positive test and he denied the allegations in an
interview with Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what's going on, and I am aware of the allegations and
am going to defend myself vigorously,'' Hunter said in a statement
released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, who is 31, seemed a certainty to win the Olympic gold
medal at the Sydney Games earlier this season. However, he suffered
a knee injury and underwent arthoscopic surgery, which forced him
to withdraw before the Olympics began.
</P>
<P>
   Nandrolone has been easily detectable for years, and it has
puzzled medical officials why a rash of cases involving the steroid
has surfaced this year. One possible explanation is that nandrolone
may be contained in improperly labeled nutritional supplements that
many athletes use, some scientists have said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Hunter had
tested positive for both nandrolone and testosterone, the male sex
hormone that can also be used synthetically as a muscle-building
steroid.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Geer, a spokeswoman for the U.S. track and field
federation, declined to comment on the article. She said the
federation did not discuss tests for performance-enhancing drugs
until an appeals process had been concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Jones won the 100 meters on Saturday night and is scheduled to
compete in the 200 meters, the long jump and the 4x100-meter relay
and the 4x400-meter relay. Now she will have to compete with the
distraction of knowing that her husband's career has come under a
drug cloud.
</P>
<P>
   Pound's decision to speak publicly appeared to be motivated by
the IOC's long-held suspicion that the Americans have been covering
up positive doping tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard that he tested positive in Norway and that the
results were conveyed to the IAAF and USA Track and Field and that
nothing has been done about it,'' Pound said of Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Gyulai denied that the test results had been suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no cover up,'' Gyulai said. ``The interest of the
athlete comes first. There is no procedure or prescription to
release such a thing. It must be understood we defend the rights of
the individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the IOC have contended for years that the Olympic
committee was reluctant to catch cheaters for fear of losing
credibility with the public and corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arne Ljundqvist, an IOC member from Sweden, said late Sunday
that the IAAF had been concerned that the American track federation
had not reported in a timely manner the results of 12 to 15
suspicious drug tests involving U.S. track and field athletes
dating to the spring of 1999. Craig Masback, the chief executive
officer of the American track federation, has called Ljundqvist's
assertions ``absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, the debate involves due process and how it is
interpreted in various countries. Each drug test involves a urine
sample that is split into two parts, known as the A sample and the
B sample. The IAAF, based in Monaco, believes that an athlete
should be suspended and an announcement made public after an A
sample tests positive. The American track federation, however, does
not suspend an athlete or announce a positive test until both an A
and a B sample have tested positive and the athlete has exhausted a
series of appeals that can last for years.  &QL;

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Whitewater ruling shows Clintonphobes wrong from
start
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's presidency was stolen from him.
</P>
<P>
   That's more or less official now that independent counsel Robert
Ray has declared that Whitewater, the ``scandal'' that launched a
thousand supposed scandals, was no scandal at all.
</P>
<P>
   Of that obscure, ancient, failed land deal _ and of all the
subsequent, retailed suspicions attached to it, from Hillary
Clinton's testimony to her legal billing records and more _ Ray
says there is ``insufficient evidence to prove to a jury beyond a
reasonable doubt that either President or Mrs. Clinton knowingly
participated in any criminal activity.''
</P>
<P>
   That's prosecutor talk for ``no case'' _ prosecutors rarely
``clear'' anyone _ but Ray's tip-toeing language has the dug-in
Clintonphobes still pushing their line.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal's editorial page, which pursued
Whitewater arcana like a mad alchemist chasing formulae for turning
dross into gold, says the apparent exoneration only proves that the
cover-up worked. The Clintons are apparently such master criminals
they eluded three successive special prosecutors who eventually
subpoenaed every record except the Clintons' toilet paper.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times concedes that, its own heavy-breathing
coverage not withstanding, maybe there was nothing to Whitewater
after all, but its editorial page, noxiously self-righteousness in
recent years, faults the Clintons anyway for defending themselves
and thus dragging the matter out. The Times never seemed to catch
on that politics was behind the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Republican chief counsel of the Senate Whitewater
hearings that flopped in 1996 says the case should have been closed
then. Indeed, it could have been closed earlier, with the
exculpatory findings of an investigation conducted for the
Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency established to mop up the
national savings-and-loan mess of which Whitewater was a small and
secondary part.
</P>
<P>
   Here at its end, look again _ as Republicans and conservative
activists have it _ at this most scandalous administration ever:
Whitewater _ no case. The Travelgate scandal _ just a political
screw up. The Filegate scandal _ only a bureaucratic fumble. The
Vincent Foster scandal _ after an absurd four (four!)
investigations, it's still just suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing and partisan foundations, hustlers, law shops, think
tanks and radio talk shows leveraged bafflingly involuted
Whitewater suspicions from their fringe rantings into the national
media and hence into political play. The official investigation was
then allowed to metastasize into new charges, additional special
prosecutors and a culture of investigation that had as it sole
objective getting something _ anything _ on either Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   (And finally succeeded only, though almost fatally, in trapping
the president in a lie about a sexual misadventure that had neither
policy nor legal relevance.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a busy industry of special-pleading outsiders,
funded by right-wing sugar daddies, piled on, as in the politically
manipulated Paula Jones lawsuit. The Ritalin-deprived Judicial
Watch alone has filed some 70 lawsuits against the president, the
White House and the administration.
</P>
<P>
   It is a personal loss for Bill Clinton that he was never allowed
to conduct the presidency to which he was twice elected, constantly
distracted and harried, even to impeachment, by politically incited
charges and investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The insult to voters runs deeper; they were all but
disenfranchised, their electoral decisions relentlessly undermined
in a campaign to void them outright.
</P>
<P>
   You have to wonder what kind of president Bill Clinton would
have been, if he had been allowed to be one.

SHOCKLESS FUTURE SHOCK

   Somewhere, William Gaddis is smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Gaddis, who died in 1998, brought four acclaimed novels into the
world, including ``The Recognitions'' and ``A Frolic of His Own.''
But after last week, his monumental ``J.R.'' comes to mind.
</P>
<P>
   That's the sprawling comic novel he published in 1975. The
book's eponymous anti-hero, a grubby 11-year-old boy, builds a
business empire by wheeling and dealing in penny stocks and bonds
from the pay phone at his middle school. Gaddis described the boy's
creed as ``get all you can.'' The novel won the first of the
author's two National Book Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the book's complexity _ and daunting 725-page length _
the message was simple: In an age when corporate executives act
like greedy children, greedy children can be corporate executives.
At the time, the picaresque J.R. seemed like the stuff of purest
fantasy: parable, not prediction.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Jonathan G. Lebed, the 15-year-old from Cedar
Grove, N.J., who made the front pages last week after the
Securities and Exchange Commission accused him of an illegal stock
manipulation scheme that garnered $272,826. His system? Wheeling
and dealing in penny stocks on the Internet in a classic ``pump and
dump'' cycle, investigators said. Jonathan was accused of buying
thinly traded stocks on his father's brokerage account, touting the
shares in online chat rooms (``the most undervalued stock in
history'') and then selling them after his rumors nudged the
stocks' prices skyward. Jonathan settled with the SEC, neither
admitting nor denying the accusations. But he did agree to pay back
the money he made, with interest.
</P>
<P>
   The parallels between J.R. and J.L. are compelling, but Jonathan
appears to have one-upped his fictional predecessor: where Gaddis'
pint-sized protagonist enlisted a hapless teacher to represent him
in his real-world transactions, thanks to the Internet Jonathan was
able to eliminate the middleman.
</P>
<P>
   Gaddis knew he was a writer ahead of his time. But the courtly
author, who pecked out his works on a portable Olivetti, would have
been stunned by the power of the Internet to enable a teen-ager to
move markets.
</P>
<P>
   What's the point of writing fiction in a world like this? These
are the days of miracles and wonder, as Paul Simon wrote in 1986.
We are living closer than ever to the future, having already been
20,000 leagues under the sea and up to the moon. We own  &UR; personal
 &LR; computers. The Internet has made its way into more than half of
America's homes; the geeks did inherit the earth. Open any given
newspaper and the day's events outpace most fiction on the
weird-o-meter. Scientists at Brandeis University announced last
month that they had created robots that design and build other
robots. Last May, college-age hackers in Manila sent out a ``love
bug'' virus that clogged computer networks around the globe _ a
tale straight out of the gritty works of writers like William
Gibson, Neal Stephenson and Bruce Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, science fiction writers may be feeling the greatest
heat. They create literature of escape, but are scrambling to
outrun the present. ``The Nasdaq has become America's most
important science fiction writer,'' said Sterling, a novelist who
lives in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He says he is not impressed with the Lebed case. The part that's
new _ the online element _ is no longer truly new, and the part
that's old is ancient. ``A kid ripping people off over the Internet
isn't that different from the Artful Dodger ripping people off in
Victorian London,'' Sterling said.
</P>
<P>
   Writing well about cyberspace is becoming more challenging, he
added, precisely because online technology has been so thoroughly
adopted by society: ``Cyber is your  &UR; uncle's &LR;  job now.''
</P>
<P>
   The future sure isn't what it used to be. In a recent TV
commercial, the actor Avery Brooks (the baritone-voiced captain
from the science fiction series ``Deep Space Nine'') says: ``It is
the year 2000 and I don't see any flying cars! I was promised
flying cars. I don't see any flying cars!  &UR; Why? Why? Why? &LR; '' The
answer, he explains, is that we don't need them, since we can get
such amazing software from, um, IBM. The underlying message: We
might be getting the future we need, even if it's not the one we
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder, then, that science fiction authors are looking in
new directions. Stephenson's influential 1999 novel
``Cryptonomicon'' takes place both in the present and in World War
II, where he found rich settings to explore his themes of
communication, code making and code breaking. In ``Distraction: a
Novel,'' Sterling's 1999 political satire, the genetically
engineered hero (associates refer to his lack of an actual mother
or father as his ``personal background problem'') tucks into a
Louisiana dinner that's truly nouvelle: a crawfish modified to grow
as big as a lobster.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling says the coming biotech boom, and the attendant specter
of so-called ``Frankenfoods,'' gives him reason to believe there's
plenty left to write about. ``The bio thing looks a lot rockier
than the cyber thing,'' he says. The pleasure in his voice is
delicious.

(A MAN WITH BIG IDEAS, A SMALL COUNTRY . . . AND OIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ Hugo Chavez spent his first 18 months as
president of Venezuela consolidating his power on the domestic
front. Now, with the price of oil nearing $40 a barrel and OPEC
scheduled to gather here this week for a conference of its heads of
state, he is about to step out onto the world stage in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   For those unfamiliar with Venezuela's president, a 46-year-old
former paratrooper who in 1992 led an unsuccessful coup attempt,
the experience promises to be overwhelming. When it comes to
international relations, Chavez is a whirlwind of ideas, plans and
visions (as he is with every other subject that interests him), and
many of these are intended to reshape the world order. This leaves
him often critical of or even hostile to U.S. positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venezuela is just too small for him,'' said Michael Shifter,
senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based
policy analysis group. ``He fancies himself as a regional and
hemispheric leader, wants to play a major role on the global stage,
and is testing the limits of how far he can go in terms of pushing
his ideas and showing off his posture in global politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Such ambitions may seem messianic and way out of proportion in a
country of modest size and huge economic and social problems. But
Venezuela has twice as many people as Cuba, and Chavez has a pair
of arrows in his quiver that his friend and mentor Fidel Castro
could never claim: the largest oil reserves outside the Middle East
and a long history as a main supplier of gasoline and heating oil
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That situation of mutual dependence gives Venezuela considerable
leverage in its dealings with the United States, and Chavez, by
arranging to have his energy minister named the president of OPEC,
has been skillful in using oil as an instrument of foreign policy.
As befits a former soldier, his own view of the world and how it
should be shaped is strongly colored by geopolitical and strategic
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 20th century was a bipolar century, but the 21st is not
going to be unipolar,'' he vowed in a speech here in August. ``The
21st century should be multipolar, and we all ought to push for the
development of such a world. So long live a united Asia, a united
Africa, a united Europe.``
</P>
<P>
   On this, as in several other areas, Chavez's views are similar
to those of one of his early advisers, a neo-fascist Argentine
theorist named Norberto Ceresole, who contends that Latin America
must forge alliances with the Middle East and Asia to
counterbalance the power of the United States and what he (but not
Chavez) calls ``the Jewish financial mafia.'' In its opposition to
American hegemony, this view has something in common with those of
countries like France and above all China, with whom Chavez has
sought closer ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soviet power has collapsed, but that does not mean that
neoliberal capitalism has to be the model followed by the peoples
of the West,'' he said during a visit to Beijing last fall. ``If
only for that reason, we invite China to keep its flag flying,
because this world cannot be run by a universal police force that
seeks to control everything.''
</P>
<P>
   In more concrete terms, Chavez believes that ``his mission in
the world is to restore some sort of equilibrium that favors less
developed countries,'' said Janet Kelly, a professor at the
Institute of Higher Administrative Studies in Caracas who is
working on a book about Venezuelan-American relations. ``When you
combine that with his liking of the center stage, it means he is
going to be acting constantly to promote any movement in the world
that goes against what he would perceive as the U.S.-dominated
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   One key to pursuing that goal is closer ties with what he calls
``our 10 partners, friends and brothers in OPEC.'' In August,
Chavez visited all the OPEC countries to invite their leaders to
the summit meeting this week, raising hackles in Washington when he
became the first head of state to call on Saddam Hussein in Baghdad
since the gulf war and when, during a stop in Libya, he described
Moammar Gadhafi as his ally.
</P>
<P>
   ``In geopolitical terms, the OPEC tour was masterful,'' said
Riordan Roett, director of the Western Hemisphere Program at Johns
Hopkins University. ``It demonstrated that Venezuela was not just a
Latin American backwater.'' He added that while the State
Department may have complained about the Iraq trip, ``more people
in the Third World now know about Chavez than they do about any
other Latin American leader except Fidel Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's relationship with the Cuban leader is complex. While he
said last year that Venezuela and Cuba are swimming together
``towards the same sea of happiness and of real social justice and
peace,'' he also seems to realize that Castro's star has faded,
leaving a vacuum that he, with all his eloquence, exuberance and
personal warmth, can perhaps fill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is admiration for Fidel, but it is linked not so much to
Cuba's domestic system, which I do not think Chavez is interested
in trying out, as it is adopting some of Fidel's style, such as the
David against Goliath stance and the sense of humor that galls the
other side,'' Kelly said. ``He is more a student of Fidel the
defiant than Fidel the Communist.'' Like Castro, Chavez seems to
enjoy nothing more than tweaking the United States, which
Washington, in a reflection of Venezuela's importance as an oil
supplier, thus far has generally endured with patience.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-VENEZUELA-CHAVEZ-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; CARACAS: with patience. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But there are real policy differences, too. Chavez has withdrawn
the Venezuelan military from regional naval exercises in the
Caribbean and refused to allow U.S. planes monitoring drug
trafficking to fly in Venezuelan airspace. Washington's decision to
use $1.3 billion to support Colombia's government in its war
against guerrillas and drug dealers promises to make the
relationship even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Chavez's former associates accuse him of supplying guns
to leftist Colombian insurgents known as the FARC. He has denied
that, but has also made it clear that he dislikes the
U.S.-sponsored Plan Colombia, warning that it may lead to ``the
Vietnamization of the entire Amazon region'' and describing the
helicopters Washington is sending to the Colombian government as
``death machines.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, Hugo Chavez and his government are on the side of
the FARC,'' Richard Gott writes in ``The Shadow of the Liberator:
The Impact of Hugo Chavez on Venezuela and Latin America'' (Verso),
a new and flattering biography. ``Chavez wants the FARC to win, or
at any rate to be so successful in the peace negotiations that its
incorporation into the government will entirely change the
political complexion of Colombia.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's principal intellectual hero is Simon Bolivar, the hero
of South American independence who dreamed of and fought for a
united continent. Chavez has argued for the formation of a South
Atlantic Treaty Organization, a Latin American counterpart to the
International Monetary Fund and a single currency for all of South
America, but he clearly wants more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of a reunified America, of a Bolivarian America, has
arisen again,'' he said in a speech in July on the Liberator's
birthday. And to Hugo Chavez, there is a natural leader of that
movement _ himself.

PUTIN AND THE PRESS: AN INVITATION YOU CAN'T REFUSE _ BE ON MY

   In Russia, rulers don't just fight to take or keep power. They
also fight to make sure they don't have to share it. This was true
for the czars, it was true for the Communist Party and, so far, it
seems to be true for President Vladimir Putin, who came to the
Kremlin by way of the KGB and its successor agency, the FSB, where
he learned to look on people as either patriots or traitors.
</P>
<P>
   This trait has been most apparent in his dealings with the
media, where Putin, more than his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, seems
determined to bring wayward journalists and media barons onto his
team.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Dorenko, arguably Russia's most famous and most
controversial television journalist, is no stranger to the power
games that pass for politics in Russia. A one-time anchorman and
board member at ORT, the country's largest channel, he has been on
both sides: a victim when he was summarily tossed off the air two
years ago by Yevgeny Primakov, who was then prime minister, and a
victimizer who has used his prime-time weekly program to mock,
condemn, expose and generally excoriate members of the anti-Kremlin
opposition (who happen to include Primakov).
</P>
<P>
   But since early summer, Dorenko has put distance between himself
and the Putin Kremlin. He criticized the arrest of the media baron
Vladimir Gusinsky in June, and in August he broadcast interviews
with angry relatives of the sailors who died when the submarine
Kursk sank. Two weeks ago, his regular Saturday night program was
suddenly yanked from the air, on what he is certain were orders
from the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference a few days later, Dorenko gave an account
of his firing, and of his dealings with Putin over the last year,
that was extraordinary in its detail. The account was one-sided, to
be sure, and the world may never know Putin's version. But
Dorenko's account was accepted in Russia as entirely believable,
which speaks volumes about the skewed relationship between power
and the press in Russia today, less than 10 years after communism's
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Dorenko's account almost evokes St. Peter. He was asked three
times to prove his loyalty and three times he ducked, saying he is
too ``cantankerous'' to be on anyone's team. After that, he got no
more chances.
</P>
<P>
   At the press conference, which was held Sept. 11, Dorenko first
recounted a conversation with Konstantin Ernst, general director of
ORT, on the night before the program was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He found me, summoned me and said that my previous program
caused strong indignation in the Kremlin and that it threatened the
ORT channel,'' Dorenko said. ``And that I had to be a patriot of
the channel and I had to make a program which they would like.'' He
said Ernst suggested a pro-Putin show, rather than repeating his
criticism. ``It could even be interesting from a dramatic point of
view,'' he recalled Ernst as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Dorenko refused, comparing the strategy to strangling oneself in
order to protect oneself from being strangled. The next day,
Dorenko said, Ernst told him the program would not be broadcast.
``His last words were . . . `As they say in the American movies:
Nothing personal.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dorenko, asked if he thought Ernst had acted on instructions
from the Kremlin, warmed to the theme of how power is exercised in
Russia. He went back over his encounters with Putin, who became
president in August after having been named acting president in
January and then winning a March election. ``The first time Putin
invited me to just have a talk with him was in September last year.
I said: `Is it an interview? I am ready' . . . He said: `No, I
wanted only to have a talk.'''
</P>
<P>
   The two met a second time that month for an interview, and again
on Jan. 15. At that meeting, Acting President Putin told Dorenko he
considered him a member of his team. Dorenko demurred, noting that
team play was not in his nature.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in June, when Gusinsky was put in prison for four days,
Dorenko responded with a dramatic appearance on Gusinsky's NTV,
ORT's rival. He warned that the old ghosts of Russia's
authoritarian past were being called back to life, revived by
secret signals coming from on high.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, according to Dorenko, summoned him soon afterward. ``He
said: `Something's wrong? . . . Something is going on, I
understood, something is going on with you.' I said: `Nothing is
going on, I am still the same.' He said that he thought that we
were people from the same team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We met one-to-one, it was in the back room, behind his office,
we had tea,'' Dorenko said. `` `We should not sort out relations
like this,''' Dorenko recalled Putin as saying.
</P>
<P>
   And then, on Aug. 29, after the Kursk sank, Dorenko was again
called to the Kremlin and wound up in Putin's office. During this
conversation, Dorenko said, he spoke of his admiration of the
president's ability to fit in with different audiences. `` `But
looking at you I see two people,'' he recalled saying. `` `One of
them has a Patek Philippe watch, and the other one has epaulettes
of the FSB.' He said, `We have the kind of country where it is
always good to have epaulettes.'''
</P>
<P>
   Putin urged Dorenko to stay on at ORT despite recent changes in
ownership. Dorenko, puzzled, asked, ``Am I leaving or did I tell
anybody that I am leaving?'' The president then clarified his
point. ``No, to stay and work as a member of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   I SAY: `Vladimir Vladimirovich, I am saying it for the third
time . . . I am not a member of the team, no matter how offensive
it may sound, of anybody's team. I work for my viewer and for the
guy I see in the mirror when I shave and for those who scream at me
demanding to free the bathroom when I am shaving. This is all, here
is my team, it's a small team, a very compact one.' And he said: `I
see you have not made a decision.' . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that my arguments were in vain, because he either
did not understand or pretended that he didn't. His last words
were: `Think, don't rush.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know the bureaucrats' logic in general and bureaucrats'
logic in Russia in particular, you have a clear understanding that
after the president says, `Think, don't rush,' no one will dare to
make a decision to take off the air or fire me or do something
against me until he has at least waved his hand. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 9, it became clear to Dorenko, who knows better than
most how power works in Russia, that its latest czar had indeed
waved his hand. After his program was canceled, Dorenko desperately
tried to reach the president but could not get through, and no one
called him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no answer,'' he said. ``Which is why I think that it
was a serious answer.''

CUT DOWN ON OUT-OF-WEDLOCK BIRTHS, WIN CASH 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating) 
 (ATTN: Ala., Ariz., Ill., Mich.)   (The Week in Review)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four years ago, as the whole debate over ``family values,''
single mothers and welfare dependency reached its peak, Congress
plopped a $400 million ``illegitimacy bonus'' program into the
welfare reform act.
</P>
<P>
   The program, financed for four years, gives an annual award of
$100 million, to be split among the five states that show the
largest decrease in out-of-wedlock births with no increase in
abortion rates.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Donna Shalala, the secretary of health and human
services, announced the second round of winners: the District of
Columbia (which Congress regards as a state for this program),
Alabama, Arizona, Illinois and Michigan will each get $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reducing out-of-wedlock births is a significant way to reduce
the risk of welfare dependency,'' said Olivia A. Golden, an
assistant secretary at the department. ``We look forward to
continued results of state efforts to use the flexibility and
resources provided by welfare reform.''
</P>
<P>
   But what the bonus really rewards, whether it has anything to do
with welfare _ and what, if anything, it accomplishes _ remains
murky, said Cory Richards, vice president for policy at the Alan
Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research organization focusing on
reproductive health and rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``About the best you can say for the bonus is that it advertises
the issue,'' Richards said. ``There's no requirement that the
states tell the government what they're doing to bring down the
rates, or even that they do anything at all, so there's no way
states can learn from each other's successes. The federal
government gives no guidance to the states as to what they should
or shouldn't do to bring down the rates. And much of the period
covered was before the welfare act even went into effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, defend the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Research has demonstrated over and over again that
single-parent families live in poverty, so asking states to try to
reduce illegitimacy rates is clearly a way of addressing the
welfare issue,'' said Susan Orr of the Family Research Council, a
conservative policy group in Washington. ``The extra money will let
the states that are doing a good job help more women and children.
It's a way to encourage responsible behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, about a third of all births in the United States are
to unmarried mothers _ a ratio that has been nearly constant for
the last six years. But that leveling off comes after decades of
rapid increases and growing concerns that children raised in
single-parent households do not fare as well as those who live with
both parents.
</P>
<P>
   The National Center for Health Statistics says births to unwed
mothers accounted for only 5.3 percent of the nation's newborns in
1960, rising to 10.7 percent in 1970, 18.4 percent in 1980 and 28
percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The bonuses awarded this month are based on statistics from
1995-1996 to 1997-1998. And most of the winners showed only tiny
decreases in births to unmarried mothers: a 0.02 percent drop in
Illinois, 0.29 percent in Alabama, 1.34 percent in Michigan, and
1.38 percent in Arizona. (Only one other state, Oregon, showed any
decline.)
</P>
<P>
   The only large decline was in Washington, D.C., where
out-of-wedlock births dropped 4.13 percent. The District of
Columbia, along with Alabama and Michigan, also won bonuses last
year in the first round of the program.
</P>
<P>
   The District has long had the highest out-of-wedlock birthrate
in the nation, running above 60 percent. But that, like the recent
declines, probably reflects its racial mix: The capital's
population is mostly black, and while black women have
traditionally had the highest rate of unmarried births, their rates
are declining, while unmarried births to white women are on the
rise.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kharfen, a spokesman for the Department of Health and
Human Services, does not dispute the idea that the bonus, so far,
is rewarding demographic changes rather than effective state
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of what this is based on precedes the welfare reform act,
and most of it is demographics,'' Kharfen said. ``And it's true
that it doesn't target welfare recipients, since it's based on all
out-of-wedlock births, and doesn't distinguish among economic
background, or the age group, of the unmarried mothers.''
</P>
<P>
   As to why the program wasn't more targeted to welfare
recipients, he said, ``you have to remember this was part of that
whole welfare reform exchange with the states, that we give you the
money and you have to achieve the goals, but we won't tell you what
to do.''

THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF REPOSITIONING ON OIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the idea of tapping the nation's Strategic
Petroleum Reserve was floated last winter, in the face of high home
heating prices in the Northeast, no one was more skeptical than
Vice President Al Gore. Oil-producing nations, he explained to a
Massachusetts audience in February, could easily counter the move.
``All they would have to do is cut back a little bit on supply and
they'd wipe out any impact from releasing oil from that reserve,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   That analysis of the realpolitik of the oil market rings as true
today as it did then. But the approach of a presidential election
has a way of altering the way candidates parse the laws of supply
and demand. Thus the decision, announced on Friday, to tap the
reserve for 30 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that Gore, stung by Gov. George W. Bush's
criticism that the administration has stumbled along with no energy
policy, feels he is facing a political crisis. Inventories of oil
are running low and everyone from truckers to commuters in SUVs is
getting angry. The Energy Department predicted early this month
that home heating oil bills would be 30 percent higher than last
winter, and today that looks conservative. Inconveniently for Gore,
the people most dependent on oil for heat live in many of the swing
states in the Midwest, which are likely to determine the outcome of
the election, now only 44 days away.
</P>
<P>
   But is there an oil crisis?
</P>
<P>
   If you ask the oil experts, the answer is no, or at least not
yet. Rather, there is a mismatch between supply and demand that is
causing prices to spike upward and has begun to prompt hoarding.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here is a classic price shock, and it goes back
to the Asian financial crisis,'' said Daniel Yergin, who has
tracked the oil markets since the Arab embargoes and sees today's
problems as very different. After the financial crisis hit, in
1997, he said, ``companies cut back on their investments around the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, everyone was guessing that it would take Southeast
Asia years to pull itself out of the hole it had dug. Few expected
the boom in the United States to last this long, or for Europe to
be posting strong growth.
</P>
<P>
   So in an industry where profits depend on managing the cost of
exploration and inventory, caution prevailed. Exploration firms dug
fewer holes and scaled back on new storage facilities. The result,
as calculated by Yergin's firm, Cambridge Energy Associates, is
that ``world productive capacity is seven million barrels a day
less than we would have otherwise expected.'' And last year, with
the price of oil low, OPEC began cutting back production. Even so,
by most estimates, the world produces two or three million barrels
a day more than the 77 million barrels it burns. But even if it
were being distributed and stockpiled with precision, there would
not be much left over. And meanwhile, demand is strong _ even in
places that a few years ago most experts expected would still be
fighting off recession.
</P>
<P>
   That's not necessarily a crisis _ but it could become one fairly
quickly. The Pentagon warns that Saddam Hussein might cut off some
of Iraq's production or that his renewed threats against Kuwait may
force it to cut it off for him. And if any kind of natural or
man-made disaster _ hurricane, earthquake, a further political
meltdown in Indonesia or a confrontation in the Taiwan Straits _
there is little margin for error.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Yergin puts it, ``We're at the extreme end of a market
cycle. That is always when risk is highest.''
</P>
<P>
   All these realities collided in the Roosevelt Room of the White
House the other day with the political demands of two campaigns _
Al Gore's and Hillary Rodham Clinton's. Just as Gore is worried
about the Midwest, Mrs. Clinton is worried about upstate New York.
And neither could make a convincing case that the administration
was easing anyone's pain.
</P>
<P>
   So with prices rising and the election ever nearer, a furious
debate broke out within the administration about whether to tap the
570-million-barrel strategic reserve, a legacy of the 1973-74 Arab
oil embargo.
</P>
<P>
   That put the ball in the court of Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson, who had had a bad year in Washington, blamed for doing
too little to keep oil flowing in and nuclear secrets at Los Alamos
labs from flowing out. Richardson wrote President Clinton arguing
for the release of 60 million barrels of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he acknowledged, the emergency reserve was created in case
of major supply disruptions, not to manipulate prices. But those
who live in Michigan or Pennsylvania and are paying exorbitant
amounts for heating oil, he argued, probably don't care whether the
cause of the problem is Saddam or Exxon. Voters just want it
solved.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, a veteran of many
currency market interventions (some that worked, some that
flopped), took the other side. Richardson's proposal, he said in a
memo that was almost instantly leaked in an effort to embarrass
Summers, would ``set a dangerous precedent.'' Echoing Gore's point
last February, he noted that OPEC could easily neutralize the
release of the stockpiled oil. He suggested that oil traders,
seeing the approach of an election, might dismiss any action as a
political ploy rather than a commitment to reverse oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   He even invoked the name of Washington's other great power, Alan
Greenspan, declaring that ``Chairman Greenspan and I believe that
using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at this time, as proposed by
DOE, would be a major and substantial policy mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-FUEL-CRISIS-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; WASHINGTON: policy mistake.'' &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but in Washington losing an election is also
considered a major mistake. So on Thursday the vice president stood
in front of some oil tanks in southern Maryland and publicly called
on his boss to begin opening the spigots on the reserve. That
hardly came as a surprise to Clinton, who had gotten a call from
Gore two days earlier, informing him of the new campaign
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday, a happy-looking Richardson announced the release
of the 30 million barrels, about 5 percent of the reserve, a far
larger amount than Gore had sought in public. The White House hopes
that it is enough to drive down prices without leaving Gore
vulnerable to Bush's charge that the release ``threatens national
security.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush may have a hard time arguing that the release leaves
America in peril, but he has a point in his criticism of the
Clinton-Gore administration's energy policy. When oil was trading
at $20 a barrel, as it was a few years ago, few in Washington
worried about the oil market. The administration focused on the
economic problems in front of it _ keeping the world economy on an
even keel _ and didn't spend much time looking at what might happen
if demand for oil picked up while inventory and production capacity
were still low.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush is almost certainly right when he says the
administration is redefining the purpose of the reserve, which was
created to protect against real supply disruptions. ``We think this
is a rainy day,'' Richardson said. ``We think that between now and
winter, because of the low stocks of home heating oil, we're in
danger of potential disruption.''
</P>
<P>
   And, by remarkable coincidence, the 30 days of government-led
oil infusions will end just two weeks before the election. Then,
Richardson said, there will still be time to ``reassess.'' Whether
he meant reassessing the oil supplies, or the polls, or both, was
not entirely clear.

THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF REPOSITIONING ON OIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the idea of tapping the nation's Strategic
Petroleum Reserve was floated last winter, in the face of high home
heating prices in the Northeast, no one was more skeptical than
Vice President Al Gore. Oil-producing nations, he explained to a
Massachusetts audience in February, could easily counter the move.
``All they would have to do is cut back a little bit on supply and
they'd wipe out any impact from releasing oil from that reserve,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   That analysis of the realpolitik of the oil market rings as true

<P>
   Now Comes the Real Revolution
</P>
<P>
   On the annual Woman's Day in Iran last week, a conservative
bureaucrat named Farah Khosravi announced that she wanted to run
for president in next year's election.
</P>
<P>
   Women make up 25 percent of Iran's labor force and half of the
university population. They drive their own cars and run their own
businesses, vote in elections and hold political office. So why not
a woman president?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Khosravi, who is 41 years old and is in charge of the
exercise curriculum for Iran's schools, is not the first woman to
express such ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   During her successful campaign for Parliament in 1996, Faezeh
Hashemi, the daughter of then-President Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani, declared that there was no reason under Iran's
constitution why a woman could not run for president. Her musings
fueled speculation that she might seek the office, but she
eventually said she was just trying to stir things up.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was picked up the following year by Azam Taleghani,
the daughter of the late Ayatollah Mahmoud Taleghani, a celebrated
cleric who had been prominent in the Iranian revolution. She
announced her candidacy for president. Taleghani had been elected
to the revolution's first parliament and ran an outspoken (now
banned) weekly newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Her action forced a debate on Iran's constitution, which said
that only a rajol _ a person of consequence _ could run. In Arabic,
the concept is masculine, but Taleghani argued that in Persian its
meaning is not clear, and she asked the opinion of the religious
scholars who drafted the 1979 constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Some said that women could not become president; others said
they could; still others said they didn't know. One said that even
hermaphrodites could be president.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Guardian Council, which vets political
candidates, disqualified Taleghani, as it did all but 4 of 230
would-be candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Taleghani counted the ruling a victory. She was told she
couldn't run because she was not ``a religious and political
personality,'' not because she was a woman.
</P>
<P>
   A Kiss for the Ages
</P>
<P>
   First Al Gore planted a big one on his wife, Tipper, at the
Democratic convention, and the pollsters said it worked wonders
with women. So after Oprah Winfrey jokingly complained that Gore
failed to kiss her in a cheery appearance on her talk show, Gov.
George W. Bush delivered a strategic smooch to her cheek last week
and declared that his favorite gift to his wife, Laura, was a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've spilled our guts on everything,'' said the author and
television personality Barbara Howar. ``We may as well show our
tonsils.''
</P>
<P>
   Who's to blame? As with so much in American politics, Bill
Clinton is the leading suspect. For two terms, Clinton has made his
family's domestic turmoil successful grist for the political mill,
from his mother's battles with his alcoholic stepfather to his own
quest for spiritual renewal after an adulterous affair. He and his
wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, were also accused of cynically
allowing photographers to capture them dancing in bathing suits
just weeks before word of Clinton's affair with a White House
intern became public.
</P>
<P>
   So the attention to this year's crop of kisses has everything to
do with last year's loves. However sincere or spontaneous the
Gores' embrace (which lasted from four to seven seconds, depending
on how much of the hug is counted), it seemed to stand in stark
contrast to Clinton's marital complications. Ditto Bush's
endorsement of spousal smacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we'll have a pucker-ometer here pretty soon that will
help us gauge our candidates,'' said Dayton Duncan, who was press
secretary to Gov. Michael Dukakis during his 1988 presidential
campaign. Duncan seems to find it all a bit mystifying. ``In my
high school, in Indianola, Iowa, the people who were known as good
kissers, everybody knew who they were,'' he said. ``And sometimes
that was good, and sometimes that was bad.''
</P>
<P>
   A Billion Consumers Live In China. Next Question?
</P>
<P>
   In a major triumph for the Clinton administration and American
business, the Senate cast a bipartisan vote to remove trade
restraints and expand commerce with China, the world's most
populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   After an often tumultuous nine-month battle, the actual vote was
slightly anticlimactic, and passed with minimal debate, 83-15.
Coupled with approval by the House in May, the vote ends the annual
congressional review of China's trade status, a Capitol Hill ritual
for 20 years that Beijing considered degrading but that critics
contended was necessary to force China to improve its record on
human rights and religious freedom. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gone, but Not Forgotten
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Ray, the independent prosecutor, ended a six-year,
almost $60 million investigation by delivering a report that
cleared both President Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, of criminal wrongdoing in connection with the Whitewater
real estate deal.
</P>
<P>
   The failed Arkansas real estate venture was the beginning of an
inquiry that broadened into wholly unexpected areas, including
Clinton's relationship with the White House intern Monica Lewinsky,
which led to the impeachment drama in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's conclusion was that there was insufficient evidence ``to
prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt'' that or Clinton
committed any crimes, though Clinton could still be indicted after
leaving office over his sworn statements in connection with his
relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic Oddities in Sydney
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics began to look a little like a soap opera, which
could only boost NBC's anemic ratings.
</P>
<P>
   First, the French runn Marie-Jose Perec, the defending champion
in the women's 200 and 400 meters, said she would not compete and
flew to Singapore. Perec claimed to have been threatened by a man
who forced his way into her Sydney hotel room, but Australian
newspapers gleefully claimed she was running away from a showdown
in the 400 meters with Australian Cathy Freeman. One labeled her
``Mademoiselle La Chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, for the first time in memory, technicians set the vault
apparatus at the wrong height for the women's gymnastics, causing
Russia's Svetlana Khorkina, then leading in the overall
championship competition, to fall. She later fell from the uneven
bars as well and, with her chance of a medal gone, refused to vault
once more on the readjusted piece of equipment. Afterward, she
angrily told reporters to ``get lost.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-THISWEEK-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &QL; 
UNDATED: ``get lost.'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What Price Power?
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years in power, President Alberto Fujimori of Peru
faced his most serious challenge, but after several days of
uncertainty appeared to have beaten back the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori announced new elections and the dissolution of the
national intelligence service after a damaging bribery episode came
to light. His spy chief, implicated in the scandal, dropped from
sight, and opposition groups called for Fujimori's immediate
resignation. On Thursday, a statement of support from the armed
forces solidified his position even if it left the price extracted
by the military and the fate of the intelligence boss unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Whitewashing History
</P>
<P>
   A billionaire homebuilder from the West Coast is giving the
Smithsonian Institution $80 million _ its largest donation ever _
to modernize the National Museum of American History.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the federally financed museum welcomed the chance
to replace displays, some of which are two decades old. Kenneth E.
Behring, 72, gave $20 million to the Smithsonian's natural history
museum in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Quitting While He's Ahead
</P>
<P>
   When he was appointed the top antitrust cop at the Justice
Department, Joel Klein was sharply criticized for being too soft,
particularly on telecommunications mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got an antitrust fellow here who rolls over and plays
dead,'' Senator Ernest Hollings said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates would probably disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Klein has now announced his intention to resign, after compiling
a formidable prosecutorial record that included the order to break
up Microsoft Corp., the dissolution of a global vitamin cartel and
the compilation of a list of proposed corporate mergers that were
abandoned or restructured after the government's antitrust
objections.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taste Funny to You?
</P>
<P>
   Complaints, complaints everywhere _ but New York City police
investigators said there was no evidence that anyone was tampering
with the bottled water sold in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The deluge began with three initial complaints, in which ammonia
and a lye-type cleaning agent were found in three water samples.
The police were leaning toward a theory that all three were
accidents, in which cleaning supplies had somehow come in contact
with bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of complaints had been filed after the first incidents
were reported, but investigators said they viewed them as the
products of fear, fantasy and flimflam.
</P>
<P>
   Trading in Human Lives
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors accused Robert E. Porges, a New York lawyer
whose Chinatown firm has represented thousands of Chinese
immigrants seeking political asylum in the United States, of
participating in the smuggling of illegal immigrants into the
country from China.
</P>
<P>
   The Porges firm, with roughly 40 lawyers and paralegals, was
also accused of helping smugglers, also known as snakeheads, to
``abduct'' illegal immigrants and of falsifying the applications of
some 6,000 asylum seekers, who paid the firm a total of $12
million. Porges' wife, Sheery Lu Porges, is accused of helping
smugglers kidnap 17 Chinese immigrants since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Porgeses and five of their employees pleaded not guilty to
all the charges, including racketeering, conspiracy and immigration
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Navigator
</P>
<P>
   The scandal over defective Firestone tires prompted Congress to
approve money for rating vehicles' tendency to roll over. This
follows evidence that most of the 103 deaths blamed on defective
tires occurred in Ford Explorers that flipped over when their tires
lost their treads.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another tire maker, Continental, recalled 160,000
tires mounted mostly on Ford's Lincoln Navigator sport utility
vehicle, while regulators began studying whether an Explorer front
suspension component was prone to defects.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said that neither the Continental tires nor the suspension
component had caused any serious crashes.

   Women make up 25 percent of Iran's labor force and half of the
university population. They drive their own cars and run their own
businesses, vote in elections and hold political office. So why not
a woman president?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Khosravi, who is 41 years old and is in charge of the
exercise curriculum for Iran's schools, is not the first woman to
express such ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   During her successful campaign for Parliament in 1996, Faezeh
Hashemi, the daughter of then-President Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani, declared that there was no reason under Iran's
constitution why a woman could not run for president. Her musings
fueled speculation that she might seek the office, but she
eventually said she was just trying to stir things up.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was picked up the following year by Azam Taleghani,
the daughter of the late Ayatollah Mahmoud Taleghani, a celebrated
cleric who had been prominent in the Iranian revolution. She
announced her candidacy for president. Taleghani had been elected
to the revolution's first parliament and ran an outspoken (now
banned) weekly newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Her action forced a debate on Iran's constitution, which said
that only a rajol _ a person of consequence _ could run. In Arabic,
the concept is masculine, but Taleghani argued that in Persian its
meaning is not clear, and she asked the opinion of the religious
scholars who drafted the 1979 constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Some said that women could not become president; others said
they could; still others said they didn't know. One said that even
hermaphrodites could be president.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Guardian Council, which vets political
candidates, disqualified Taleghani, as it did all but 4 of 230
would-be candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Taleghani counted the ruling a victory. She was told she
couldn't run because she was not ``a religious and political
personality,'' not because she was a woman.
</P>
<P>
   A Kiss for the Ages
</P>
<P>
   First Al Gore planted a big one on his wife, Tipper, at the
Democratic convention, and the pollsters said it worked wonders
with women. So after Oprah Winfrey jokingly complained that Gore
failed to kiss her in a cheery appearance on her talk show, Gov.
George W. Bush delivered a strategic smooch to her cheek last week
and declared that his favorite gift to his wife, Laura, was a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've spilled our guts on everything,'' said the author and
television personality Barbara Howar. ``We may as well show our
tonsils.''
</P>
<P>
   Who's to blame? As with so much in American politics, Bill
Clinton is the leading suspect. For two terms, Clinton has made his
family's domestic turmoil successful grist for the political mill,
from his mother's battles with his alcoholic stepfather to his own
quest for spiritual renewal after an adulterous affair. He and his
wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, were also accused of cynically
allowing photographers to capture them dancing in bathing suits
just weeks before word of Clinton's affair with a White House
intern became public.
</P>
<P>
   So the attention to this year's crop of kisses has everything to
do with last year's loves. However sincere or spontaneous the
Gores' embrace (which lasted from four to seven seconds, depending
on how much of the hug is counted), it seemed to stand in stark
contrast to Clinton's marital complications. Ditto Bush's
endorsement of spousal smacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we'll have a pucker-ometer here pretty soon that will
help us gauge our candidates,'' said Dayton Duncan, who was press
secretary to Gov. Michael Dukakis during his 1988 presidential
campaign. Duncan seems to find it all a bit mystifying. ``In my
high school, in Indianola, Iowa, the people who were known as good
kissers, everybody knew who they were,'' he said. ``And sometimes
that was good, and sometimes that was bad.''
</P>
<P>
   A Billion Consumers Live In China. Next Question?
</P>
<P>
   In a major triumph for the Clinton administration and American
business, the Senate cast a bipartisan vote to remove trade
restraints and expand commerce with China, the world's most
populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   After an often tumultuous nine-month battle, the actual vote was
slightly anticlimactic, and passed with minimal debate, 83-15.
Coupled with approval by the House in May, the vote ends the annual
congressional review of China's trade status, a Capitol Hill ritual
for 20 years that Beijing considered degrading but that critics
contended was necessary to force China to improve its record on
human rights and religious freedom. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gone, but Not Forgotten
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Ray, the independent prosecutor, ended a six-year,
almost $60 million investigation by delivering a report that
cleared both President Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, of criminal wrongdoing in connection with the Whitewater
real estate deal.
</P>
<P>
   The failed Arkansas real estate venture was the beginning of an
inquiry that broadened into wholly unexpected areas, including
Clinton's relationship with the White House intern Monica Lewinsky,
which led to the impeachment drama in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's conclusion was that there was insufficient evidence ``to
prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt'' that or Clinton
committed any crimes, though Clinton could still be indicted after
leaving office over his sworn statements in connection with his
relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic Oddities in Sydney
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics began to look a little like a soap opera, which
could only boost NBC's anemic ratings.
</P>
<P>
   First, the French runn Marie-Jose Perec, the defending champion
in the women's 200 and 400 meters, said she would not compete and
flew to Singapore. Perec claimed to have been threatened by a man
who forced his way into her Sydney hotel room, but Australian
newspapers gleefully claimed she was running away from a showdown
in the 400 meters with Australian Cathy Freeman. One labeled her
``Mademoiselle La Chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, for the first time in memory, technicians set the vault
apparatus at the wrong height for the women's gymnastics, causing
Russia's Svetlana Khorkina, then leading in the overall
championship competition, to fall. She later fell from the uneven
bars as well and, with her chance of a medal gone, refused to vault
once more on the readjusted piece of equipment. Afterward, she
angrily told reporters to ``get lost.''

<P>
   What Price Power?
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years in power, President Alberto Fujimori of Peru
faced his most serious challenge, but after several days of
uncertainty appeared to have beaten back the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori announced new elections and the dissolution of the
national intelligence service after a damaging bribery episode came
to light. His spy chief, implicated in the scandal, dropped from
sight, and opposition groups called for Fujimori's immediate
resignation. On Thursday, a statement of support from the armed
forces solidified his position even if it left the price extracted
by the military and the fate of the intelligence boss unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Whitewashing History
</P>
<P>
   A billionaire homebuilder from the West Coast is giving the
Smithsonian Institution $80 million _ its largest donation ever _
to modernize the National Museum of American History.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the federally financed museum welcomed the chance
to replace displays, some of which are two decades old. Kenneth E.
Behring, 72, gave $20 million to the Smithsonian's natural history
museum in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Quitting While He's Ahead
</P>
<P>
   When he was appointed the top antitrust cop at the Justice
Department, Joel Klein was sharply criticized for being too soft,
particularly on telecommunications mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got an antitrust fellow here who rolls over and plays
dead,'' Senator Ernest Hollings said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates would probably disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Klein has now announced his intention to resign, after compiling
a formidable prosecutorial record that included the order to break
up Microsoft Corp., the dissolution of a global vitamin cartel and
the compilation of a list of proposed corporate mergers that were
abandoned or restructured after the government's antitrust
objections.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taste Funny to You?
</P>
<P>
   Complaints, complaints everywhere _ but New York City police
investigators said there was no evidence that anyone was tampering
with the bottled water sold in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The deluge began with three initial complaints, in which ammonia
and a lye-type cleaning agent were found in three water samples.
The police were leaning toward a theory that all three were
accidents, in which cleaning supplies had somehow come in contact
with bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of complaints had been filed after the first incidents
were reported, but investigators said they viewed them as the
products of fear, fantasy and flimflam.
</P>
<P>
   Trading in Human Lives
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors accused Robert E. Porges, a New York lawyer
whose Chinatown firm has represented thousands of Chinese
immigrants seeking political asylum in the United States, of
participating in the smuggling of illegal immigrants into the
country from China.
</P>
<P>
   The Porges firm, with roughly 40 lawyers and paralegals, was
also accused of helping smugglers, also known as snakeheads, to
``abduct'' illegal immigrants and of falsifying the applications of
some 6,000 asylum seekers, who paid the firm a total of $12
million. Porges' wife, Sheery Lu Porges, is accused of helping
smugglers kidnap 17 Chinese immigrants since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Porgeses and five of their employees pleaded not guilty to
all the charges, including racketeering, conspiracy and immigration
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Navigator
</P>
<P>
   The scandal over defective Firestone tires prompted Congress to
approve money for rating vehicles' tendency to roll over. This
follows evidence that most of the 103 deaths blamed on defective
tires occurred in Ford Explorers that flipped over when their tires
lost their treads.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another tire maker, Continental, recalled 160,000
tires mounted mostly on Ford's Lincoln Navigator sport utility
vehicle, while regulators began studying whether an Explorer front
suspension component was prone to defects.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said that neither the Continental tires nor the suspension
component had caused any serious crashes.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; THE FEELING OF WHAT HAPPENS: Body and Emotion in the Making of
Consciousness &LR;  By Antonio Damasio. (Harvest/Harcourt, $15.) A
neurologist, drawing on the experiences of patients over many
years, explains the difference between intelligence and
consciousness, and the central role of emotion in forming
consciousness. His account, chosen by the editors of The New York
Times Book Review as one of the best books of 1999, is ``a
must-read book ... on one of the greatest unsolved mysteries,''
William H. Calvin wrote.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A GESTURE LIFE &LR;  By Chang-rae Lee. (Riverhead, $13.) Franklin
Hata, this novel's elderly Korean-born narrator, looks back on his
life from his comfortable perch in a leafy New York suburb, finding
clues to his true identity in his service in the Japanese army
during World War II. The result is ``a beautiful, solitary,
remarkably tender book that reveals the shadows that fall
constantly from the past,'' Andrew O'Hagan wrote last year in The
New York Times Book Review.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE TRUST: The Private and Powerful Family Behind The New York
Times &LR;  By Susan E. Tifft and Alex S. Jones. (Back Bay/Little,
Brown, $18.95.) The authors conducted some 550 interviews and
extensive archival research to tell the monumental story of Adolph
S. Ochs, who bought The Times in 1896, and those family members who
stewarded the paper through the years. Last year the reviewer Ron
Chernow called this a ``lively, lavishly detailed epic.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PLAINSONG &LR;  By Kent Haruf. (Vintage Contemporaries, $13.) In
unadorned prose that echoes its characters' unadorned lives, this
novel records a season of changes great and small in an isolated
town on the high plains of Colorado. The result is an intimate tale
that is ``so foursquare, so delicate and lovely, that it has the
power to exalt the reader,'' Verlyn Klinkenborg wrote in The New
York Times Book Review in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DARK WIND: A Survivor's Tale of Love and Loss &LR;  By Gordon
Chaplin. (Plume, $14.) The author tells of his long voyage aboard a
36-foot motor cruiser with the woman he loved, and of the bad luck
and missteps that led to her death during a typhoon in the Marshall
Islands. ``Chaplin writes vivid prose, with snappy dialogue,''
Anthony Bailey wrote in 1999, and his ``account of their
catastrophe is tense and moving.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEIGHBORS &LR;  By Thomas Berger. (Zoland, $13.) In this satirical
1980 novel, a mild-mannered suburbanite finds his civility tested
when he gets sucked into the vortex of his new neighbors, who have
a penchant for strange games and inflicting pain and humiliation.
```Neighbors' is a wonderfully funny and mysterious book,'' Thomas
R. Edwards wrote. ``Berger is one of our most intelligent, witty
and independent-minded writers.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SLEEPING WITH EXTRA-TERRESTRIALS: The Rise of Irrationalism and
Perils of Piety &LR;  By Wendy Kaminer. (Vintage, $13.) In a sweeping
critique of the blind irrationality running through what she sees
as today's evangelical culture, the author takes on everything from
alien abduction to New Age spiritualism. Even if her analysis is
hit or miss, Kaminer is ``a sharp, outspoken thinker,'' Caroline
Knapp wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SOLSTICE &LR;  By Joyce Carol Oates. (Ontario Review, $14.95.) This
dark novel explores the obsessive (and destructive) romance between
two determinedly heterosexual women: a timid young teacher trying
to escape her disastrous marriage and an artist who has just lost
her husband. ``The voyage is not for the faint of heart,'' Rebecca
Pepper Sinkler wrote in 1985. ``Oates, never squeamish about
looking into the dark places of the soul, has aimed a powerful beam
into that shadowy chamber.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PRIMO LEVI: Tragedy of an Optimist &LR;  By Myriam Anissimov.
(Overlook, $18.95.) According to this well-researched biography,
this Italian writer and Auschwitz survivor had a lifelong faith in
clarity of thinking and an enduring reverence for language.
``Anissimov's book ... provides a serious, lively, at times
fervently told story that is always sympathetic to Levi's shy
personality and restrained tone,'' Victor Brombert said last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PERSIAN BRIDES &LR;  By Dorit Rabinyan. (George Braziller, $15.95.)
Set in turn-of-the-century Persia, this novel tells of a
15-year-old girl, who yearns for the return of her unborn child's
father, and her 11-year-old cousin, desperate to get married
herself despite the grim lot of women in their society. ``Rabinyan
grounds her themes of sexual politics in scenes mingling exotic
beauty and gritty horror,'' Michael Lowenthal wrote in 1998.

 &HT;    The Reagan Memorial _ There they go again
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Alexander Hamilton was not nearly as
likable as Ronald Reagan. He was vain, sneaky and had to let
everybody know he was the smartest guy in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, I know: He laid the foundation for the American economic
system and kept the nation fiscally afloat when we were a mere
start-up venture. But born illegitimate and dead in a duel? And
that nasty negative campaign against Thomas Jefferson? And the hush
money paid after an adulterous affair? Is this a role model for
children?
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the Reagan Legacy Project wants an engraving of Reagan
winking at us from the front of the $10 bill. It's a family values
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan Legacy Project has the broader goal of getting
governments _ federal, state, local and foreign _ to name roads,
buildings and inanimate objects in general after Reagan. The $10
bill is one of their more ambitious goals. (And what could they do
to top that? Rename a state?)
</P>
<P>
   On a more modest scale, the movement to rename, name and
memorialize in honor of Reagan is meeting with success. In Florida,
there's the Ronald Reagan Turnpike and Miami's Ronald Reagan
Avenue. In Washington, there's the airport and the Ronald Reagan
Building and International Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   And Republicans in Congress want to waive the dead-for-25-years
rule and other inconvenient restrictions on Mall memorials to make
way for a Reagan Monument among the Jefferson, Lincoln and
Washington monuments. The legislation recently passed the House
Resources Committee and backers hope for approval before Congress
adjourns.
</P>
<P>
   Let people call this ``a do-nothing Congress'' after that
accomplishment!
</P>
<P>
   But regardless of how warmly folks might remember the Reagan
years, there's something about the whole commemorative movement
that should call out the Irony Squad.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't Reagan the president who said we'd be better off with
fewer buildings full of government workers, public works projects
and focus on Washington?
</P>
<P>
   So how are politicians honoring his memory? By putting his name
on buildings full of government workers and on government
public-works projects. Plus, a memorial in the heart of D.C.
</P>
<P>
   There they go again.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the Name it for Reagan Movement, it's easy to wonder
about this tendency to name things after political leaders to the
exclusion of everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   We as a people tend to ridicule our leaders, razz politicians
and believe the worst of people we elect. Yet, when it comes to
naming buildings, christening roads and generally putting up signs,
nobody but a politician will do. Preferably a politician of the
immediately preceding generation.
</P>
<P>
   It's as though we feel bad for the way we treated them and want
to make up for it.
</P>
<P>
   In other countries, they seem better able to honor people
outside the government. Foreign currencies, for example, show
artists, musicians and writers. But here in America, we spend
politician money exclusively. (OK, except for the new Sacagawea
dollar, which is so cool people hoard it rather than spend it.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, I'd keep Hamilton on the $10. He's a handsome devil, even
if he was mean to Jefferson. On the redesigned bills, he looks
younger, snappier and perhaps just a little more smug than on the
old bills.
</P>
<P>
   But if he's got to go, then in a Reaganesque tribute to private
achievement, I would replace him with someone from the private
sector _ Thomas Edison, Mark Twain, Babe Ruth or somebody.
</P>
<P>
   I know, a lot of the people supporting this sort of thing are
from the government and they're here to help. But it's getting out
of hand.
</P>
<P>
   That's Reagan's name, don't wear it out.

 &HT;    Don't let the facts get in the way of ignorance
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ ``Ignorant folks,'' my father used to say,
``are not stupid _ they're just uninformed in some areas. Still,
they're mighty good at finger-pointing and name-calling. But,''
he'd remind me, ``always remember
</P>
<P>
   they're voicing their own fears, not their knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, I must have heard this at least a hundred times.
The first I recall was the day I came home from kindergarten crying
because a mean kid named Hermie had made fun of me for carrying a
man-sized handkerchief in my dress pocket. I told him I needed it.
I had hay fever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oo-ooh!'' rotten Hermie wailed, clapping a hand over his nose
and announcing to the rest of the five-year-olds in the color
circle (that's where we sat on the floor rolling balls around and
hollering: Red! Blue! Purkle!), Lizzie's got hay fever!''
</P>
<P>
   The circle receded in horror as I tried to explain that no one
could catch it, it was just an allergy. I should have saved my
breath, but at the time I was too young to realize there would
always be folks around who didn't want to
</P>
<P>
   be confused with the facts. When nap time came, my friend Janet
wouldn't even put her rug down next to mine because her mom had
told her not to hang out with runny-nosed kids.
</P>
<P>
   That's the first ``ignorance'' talk I remember having with my
father. He explained how a lack of knowledge frightens some folks.
Daddy was kinder than I. Next day I went to school and started a
rumor that Hermie had leprosy and his fingers and toes were going
to fall off. We'd been talking about it in Sunday school and I
remembered all the gory details.
</P>
<P>
   Daddy wouldn't have approved, but let me tell you, I felt GOOD
when Hermie had to play trucks all by himself that afternoon
because no one wanted to risk having assorted body parts drop off
in the sandbox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Susie called me a `slut' on the way to school, Ms. Schuett,''
Candy, a pretty little 8th-grader sobbed one morning as she swept
into my classroom. ``Am I a slut?'' I remember slipping an arm
around her shoulders and maneuvering the
</P>
<P>
   heart-broken child into the chair beside my desk. As I supplied
tissues and waited for the histrionics to subside, I silently
thanked the smut peddlers who substitute slime for talent, and aim
it at our kids. Then I called Susie in
</P>
<P>
   for a chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candy says you called her a slut. Is that true?'' Susie hemmed
and hawed, and then confessed she had indeed labeled her friend a
loose woman. When I asked why, Susie shrugged. I tried again. ``Did
you mean to call her a prostitute?''
</P>
<P>
   Susie was dumbfounded. It took her a minute to find her voice
and when she did, she began explaining to me that wasn't the
meaning of slut. I asked what is was then. ``It means someone who
makes you mad and talks about you behind your back because she's
trying to steal your boyfriend,'' Susie pronounced, secure in the
knowledge of what she thought she knew. I shook my head and handed
her the Webster's Unabridged, hoping at least she knew how to spell
what she'd been calling her friend. She did. And she was shocked
when I had her read the definition aloud.
</P>

   Susie apologized to Candy and by lunch they were giggling on the

<P>
   It's Hermie and Susie and Candy I'm reminded of as I read this
morning about some folks in Cuzco, Peru, wanting to banish their
flag because it too closely resembles the gay-pride banner.
Visiting dignitaries, they complain, have

   The University of Hawaii has replaced the rainbow they sported
for so many years on their football helmets, with an ``H,'' and
changed their names from the Rainbow Warriors to just, Warriors.
Guess they'd finally had it with snide

<P>
   finger-pointers and name-callers. That's understandable.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still a sad fact of life that no matter how educated
some folks get to be, they remain driven by their fears and
blissful ignorance.

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Bill Clinton's presidency was stolen from him.
That's more or less official now that independent counsel Robert
Ray has declared that Whitewater, the ``scandal'' that launched a
thousand supposed scandals, was no scandal at all. (Teepen, Cox

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ ``Ignorant folks,'' my
father used to say, ``are not stupid _ they're just uninformed in
some areas. Still, they're mighty good at finger-pointing and
name-calling. But,'' he'd remind me, ``always remember they're
voicing their own fears, not their knowledge.'' Over the years, I

   LANE-COLUMN _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Alexander Hamilton was not
nearly as likable as Ronald Reagan. He was vain, sneaky and had to
let everybody know he was the smartest guy in the room. Yeah, I
know: He laid the foundation for the American economic system and
kept the nation fiscally afloat when we were a mere start-up
venture. But born illegitimate and dead in a duel? And that nasty
negative campaign against Thomas Jefferson? And the hush money paid
after an adulterous affair? Is this a role model for children?

 &HT;    New movie's Web site like strange dream
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After six or seven visits to the Requiem for a Dream
Web site, I still have no idea what it's about.
</P>
<P>
   It (www.requiemforadream.com) looks like a Web site for a TV
game show _ run by some inspirational Tony Robbins-like person who
hawks books and other things that are guaranteed to make you
richer, thinner, happier, loved and admired.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you try to click on one of the buttons to order a
book, be a contestant on the show or even sign the guest book, the
site disintegrates in front of your eyes. After it literally
vanishes off the screen, eerie music follows and the words
``Requiem for a Dream'' flash across the screen.
</P>
<P>
   And then it's over. Just like that. Just like a dream. You can't
go back. Sure, you can reload the site and try something different,
but the results will be the same.
</P>
<P>
   The site is confusing and very, very strange.
</P>
<P>
   But here's where I can let you in on a little secret.
Requiemforadream.com is really a promotional site for a movie of
the same name set to open in New York and Los Angeles in October
and nationwide later in the month.
</P>
<P>
   What's it about? Who knows.
</P>
<P>
   The site is produced by a New York company called Artisan
Entertainment _ the same people who had movie fans crowded around
their computer monitors last summer to watch the eerie trailer for
``The Blair Witch Project.'' It uses the same vague and spooky
techniques to stir up advance interest in this film from Sundance
Film Festival darling Darren Aronofsky, whose debut feature ``Pi''
was a big hit at the annual event.
</P>
<P>
   My personal search to discover what ``Requiem'' is about turned
into a scavenger hunt to nearly every movie and book site on the
Web. Is this the goal of the site's designers _ to intrigue Web
surfers to the point where there is no limit to the number of sites
they'll visit to find out what this movie is about? It could be.
</P>
<P>
   If that's how it works out, the filmmakers can turn around and
call it the most searched site on the Web. Has a nice marketing
ring to it, no question about it, but not everybody has this kind
of commitment. Or does this stuff for a living. And sometimes too
much information can be a dangerous thing.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this blurb from the production notes culled from the
Yahoo Movies Web site (movies.yahoo.com). Director Aronofsky said,
``One of the things this film is about is the hole we create in our
present when we chase the illusion of tomorrow and then the
distances we go to fill that vacuum with anything and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not much help, is it?
</P>
<P>
   Reading deeper into the production notes, we find the movie is
based on a novel by Hubert Selby Jr., who also wrote ``Last Exit to
Brooklyn,'' which also was made into a movie.
</P>
<P>
   A quick trip to Amazon.com reveals the book has a five-star
rating from Amazon's loyal cadre of readers and reviewers.
</P>
<P>
   One Amazon reader from London who loved the book described it as
one where things don't always turn out as they seem. ``This book
shows human determination in the extreme. Each person, with only
one thing in mind, does anything to sustain the dream, deceiving
each other and themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   If you feel you need to read the book before experiencing the
Web site of the actual movie, Amazon has it on sale for $13.45,
excluding shipping, of course. You can also pre-order the ``Requiem
for a Dream soundtrack, while you're at it, if the techno-gothic
music you've heard on the Web site appeals to you.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Artisan Entertainment suggests viewing the
trailer for the movie at www.requiemforadream.
com/equiemtrailer.mov. ``Enjoy the trippy experience!'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it sure is trippy. The Quicktime video is a fast-paced
montage of images _ some beautiful, some creepy and some just plain
odd. And it still provides no real description of what this movie
is about.
</P>
<P>
   Now, what I've been able to conclude from all this Web surfing
sparked by a very mysterious Web site is that ``Requiem for a
Dream'' is a beautiful but disturbing film that probably makes some
interesting points about the lengths people will go to attain
ultimate happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Now as Dennis Miller likes to say, ``That's just my opinion. I
could be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But trying to find the answers sent me off on a fascinating
search.
</P>
<P>
   That's probably what Artisan Entertainment and the film's
producers wanted me to do _ get so hooked on finding out about the
film and finding nothing that I go to the movie just to get a plot
summary if nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows, it just might work.

 &HT;    Thrills from `Spider-Man' worthy of classic comic
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Spider-Man '' is the latest superhero to come to the
rescue of the PlayStation console system.
</P>
<P>
   With the public's ever-mounting anticipation for next month's
arrival of the PlayStation 2 in retail stores, Sony's original
system has almost become a forgotten item.
</P>
<P>
   Just as ``Spider-Man'' always rushes to the aid of New York
City, he does the same for PlayStation. The $39.99 video game by
Activision is one of the best action-adventure games of the year _
on any system.
</P>
<P>
   The game's developers deserve credit, first and foremost, for
sticking as closely as possible to the heroic character in Stan
Lee's legendary comic book series. Spider-Man is definitely true to
himself in the game, right down to his sarcastic comments such as
``Maybe you ought to fight next time'' after knocking out an
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The plot of ``Spider-Man,'' which has 34 levels, is simple:
Protect the Big Apple from villains. The fighting locations include
such familiar places as the Daily Bugle, Times Square and a New
York bank.
</P>
<P>
   Loyal followers of Spider-Man know that the web-slinging wizard
is most effective with finesse moves _ and not by overpowering an
opponent. You must keep this strategy in mind when playing the
video game.
</P>
<P>
   Players can shoot webs to swing from building to building. They
can climb on the side of walls and from upside down to secretly
view and surprise the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Spider-Man's weaponry includes the traditional web-trapping,
along with being able to launch an impact web to knock the villains
off their feet.
</P>
<P>
   There are also a few new items in Spider-Man's arsenal, most
notably the ``Web Dome.'' When surrounded by foes, the superhero
forms an igloo-shaped dome around himself made of web, which
explodes seconds later and damages everything in its path.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spider-Man'' has a quick learning curve, even for those not
familiar with the comic book. Allies such as Dare Devil and Black
Cat seem to always be around to offer tips for new moves and tricks
to use in fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The story line of the game develops as you play, and gamers are
rewarded with full-motion videos between each level to enhance the
plot.

 &HT;    All-in-one browsers offer the Web, chat, e-mail and more
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Welcome to the era of the mega-browser.
</P>
<P>
   You may be thinking: ``What on earth is a megabrowser and why
would I ever want or need one? My trusty Netscape or Internet
Explorer browser works just fine, thank you very much.''
</P>
<P>
   But megabrowsers from big guns like Microsoft (which rolled out
its MSN Explorer browser earlier this month) and smaller companies
like the Norcross, Ga.-based Ultrabrowser are one of the hottest
Web trends today. The companies are hoping this new breed of
one-stop browser will foster Web loyalty that will last a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to provide one-stop shopping for busy Web users or
newcomers who don't have time to read up on all the Web has to
offer. These new browsers tuck almost every Internet task into one
neat package: Surfing, searching, instant messaging, shopping, news
and e-mail, audio, video and eventually phone service are all
there. All you have to do is download and go. The idea is to
develop a loyal audience that will keep coming back. That
translates into money because the more users any site or product
has, the more advertisers it attracts and the more money it's
possible to make.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape is also hoping to develop user loyalty with its latest
browser _ Netscape 6. It will incorporate many features of popular
parent company America Online. Among other things, Netscape 6 will
provide continuous and customized news updates automatically
``pushed'' to the user as well as links to AOL's instant messenger
software.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a slightly different tack is super portal Yahoo. Yahoo
has a new product called Yahoo Companion that will customize your
current browser with a Yahoo toolbar that contains the links you
specify. ``Y Companion'' will download a Yahoo toolbar and hook it
right into your current browser. If you are a Yahoo registered
user, you can also import other sites you've bookmarked and have
them turn up on the toolbar.
</P>
<P>
   This new crop of browsers is an attempt to create what is known
as ``stickiness.'' Remember when search engines just searched the
Web? There was a time when Yahoo, Lycos and the other major portals
had one purpose : Helping users find what they were looking for
elsewhere on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Then Web-measurement firm MediaMetrix developed data, later
supported by competing firm Nielsen/NetRatings, that users were
typing in search data, getting the information they wanted and then
leaving the sites so fast they were leaving virtual skid marks. If
you look at any of the major portals, you find a variety of things
to do there from checking the news to downloading music and even
keeping an online appointment calendar.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft Network online service was first out of the gate
with its superbrowser called the MSN Explorer browser. Although
it's still in the development stages, it can be downloaded at the
MSN Web site (www.msn.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did we do this?'' MSN Explorer's group program manager
Hillel Cooperman said to a skeptical group of analysts and
reporters at a demonstration in New York City. ``To get to the next
level this is what it's going to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooperman and his bosses at Microsoft already know that
developing software _ whether it is for the computer or the
Internet _ is what Microsoft is all about. Unlike Atlanta-based
EarthLink or AT&AMP;T's WorldNet, it knows the core business is not
access, it is giving consumers something useful and engaging to do
once they get to a site.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Internet service providers and anyone else focused on
catching up to AOL in terms of both subscribers and revenue, MSN is
targeting new computer and Web users who know they need to be
online but don't know exactly how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The online experience isn't simple,'' Cooperman said. He said
that three out of 12 users can't get online because they literally
cannot navigate the installation process. Research based on the old
MSN network showed that four out of 12 users gave up when trying to
install the software.
</P>
<P>
   MSN developed its new browser with a sharp eye on AOL. With AOL
at 25 million members, even its most bitter rivals are forced to
concede AOL is doing something right. ``AOL has been a pioneer at
integrating services,'' Cooperman said. ``People on AOL take the
Web for granted because AOL has harnessed everything into one
place.''
</P>
<P>
   So why reinvent the wheel? Microsoft has already built a suite
of Web sites and applications including Hotmail, HomeAdvisor,
Carpoint and MSN Money, which are considered to be among the top
Web sites in their respective categories.
</P>
<P>
   However, Cooperman says that the ``a la carte approach'' doesn't
work for everyone. While some users don't mind surfing the Web to
find and bookmark the sites they want, other people _ and many of
the 25 million AOL users would be in this group _ like having
everything prepackaged for them.
</P>
<P>
   MSN Explorer is a browser that users can download and install
for free. It looks like Microsoft's conventional browser, the
Internet Explorer, but it also includes a personal start page users
can customize. From there you have one-stop access to your Hotmail
or MSN e-mail account, local weather and links to all the MSN
properties. Also included in the package is Windows Media, an audio
and video player that lets users listen to music or watch streaming
videos while they work.There's a music icon on the toolbar that
lets users select from hundreds of radio stations all around the
world. Newbies will appreciate how easy it is to use, while
veterans will appreciate not having to hunt around for software or
download information.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the MSN browser is still in development, don't be
afraid to download it. It works well, appears to be bug-free and
doesn't reconfigure any of the settings already on your computer.
It's also attractive and fun to use, even for grizzled vets.
</P>
<P>
   The collection of information and integration of Web
applications makes going online a lot easier for new users and
old-timers alike.
</P>
<P>
   There's no hunting around for software plug-ins or being
overwhelmed with windows, buttons and strange new terms like
``keyword'' or ``IM.'' You can start listening to music or writing
e-mail the minute you log on. You can also register for MSN's
Passport service, which remembers your user name and password so
you don't have to as you travel across MSN sites and others that
use the Passport system.
</P>
<P>
   MSN has also customized the browser to reflect the city you live
in. New York users get a nice shot of the Manhattan skyline, while
Atlanta users get to see their own personal skyline. It's a small
thing but does personalize the Web. Also included in the service is
the MSN messenger, and a phone service is on the way. Users can
purchase Internet access from MSN directly or they can just use MSN
Explorer with any ISP they currently have instead of launching a
conventional browser.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia Loizides, a Web technology analyst with Jupiter
Communications, says the MSN Explorer is not AOL, but it's not a
Web browser, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really call it a browser,'' she says. ``It's
inherently different.The browser is in the background. They are
delivering a new kind of user interface and trying to make things
as simple as possible for somebody coming fresh onto the Web who
doesn't want to fuss with a whole lot of windows.''
</P>
<P>
   At the MSN demonstration in New York, the company went to great
pains to show how many windows it might take to get something done
on AOL. No windows burst open with MSN Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Personalization that really makes a browser look like it was
built just for you is also the goal of a Norcross-based firm called
Ultrabrowser.com. Ultrabrowser is hoping Web surfers are tired
looking at the big Netscape ``N'' or the little Microsoft windows
icon twirling around in their browser windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've done is create an Internet environment,'' says
Yassine Sbiti company founder, interim president and chief
executive. ``We've incorporated a search engine, directories,
access to TV and radio and an area you can customize.''
</P>
<P>
   You can download a plain ``vanilla'' version of Ultrabrowser
right now at its Web site (www.ultrabrowser.com). Ultrabrowser's
goal is to customize its product for companies and organizations
all over the world. For example, a university might have
Ultrabrowser design a browser with the school's logo that it will
distribute free on its home page or via CDs given to students,
alumni and others. The ``skin'' or on-screen appearance will be
tailored for an institution or company and the start page will
always be the company's home page.
</P>
<P>
   Sbiti says the schools, companies and organizations distributing
Ultrabrowser bring a whole new dimension to branding on the Web.
``It's a different thing entirely,'' he says. ``You used to be a
Web site. Now you're a browser.''
</P>
<P>
   What both these new megabrowsers want to do is attract loyal
users and hold them. MSN is hoping its suite of sites and services
will win hearts. Ultrabrowser is hoping the idea of a personalized
look and feel combined with services will entice users. For Yahoo,
an ever-present toolbar will generate more users than the Web site
alone. As for Netscape, just looking a little bit like AOL will go
a long way toward holding on to its users.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter's Loizides said loyalty is the name of the game when it
comes to customer retention.
</P>
<P>
   ``MSN is trying to build relationships with the client and the
Internet and they're betting you'll invest all this time in the
site,'' she said. ``They're hoping you won't want to take all the
photos you've uploaded to your personal photo albums and take them
to another site.''
</P>
<P>
   While these sites may build loyalty, it could still be too
little too late if MSN or anybody else wants to catch AOL, she
believes:
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so far ahead, does that mean there's no hope of MSN
or anyone else catching up? This may not be the golden arrow that's
going to get them up to AOL's numbers. But if they can parallel the
types of services AOL has, then they are on an even playing field.
And if you have a great interface and have all the features rolled
up into one place and boom it's right in front of you, that's
something.''

 &HT;    Internet's elementary lessons reach from near to far away
 &HT;    By Anne Meyers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ My children attend a school in our community. Our
school launches them on trips far and near. Some of those trips are
off-site field trips by bus. Many are classroom-based journeys to
faraway worlds.
</P>
<P>
   With their current studies, one child takes field trips to
places in our community while the other learns about places like
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   This week my oldest child enjoyed a lesson about Kenya when her
librarian shared stories of her real-life travels. Looking at the
librarian's travel treasures was an exciting lesson for the
children.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers cover thousands of miles from their classrooms.
These study units include places I have visited and learned about.
There are other times when my children learn about things that I am
unfamiliar with that I need to learn about. If I want to be a part
of their teaching, I need to share in their studies.
</P>
<P>
   My children show enthusiasm for their learning, owed in great
part to their schools and teachers. They introduce me to lessons
that enrich my knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, I might one day be a solid contender for ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is my quick trip to self-motivated study hall.
Together my kids and I can work on studies and outside interests.
Current plans for one child include a field trip to the Tullie
Smith Farm (www.atlhist.org
</P>
<P>
   /HousesGardens/html/tulliesmith.htm) and lessons about places
and people in our community.
</P>
<P>
   The Tullie Smith Farm description on the Web was useful to me. I
am not a native Atlantan, and before I had school-age children had
never heard of the place. Now, armed with a description from the
Atlanta History Center, I understand where the Tullie Smith Farm is
located and what its purpose is for a field trip.
</P>
<P>
   My other child's study of Africa allows us to search Web sites
for facts about the continent.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Internet research so special for us is that we can do
it together in our small amounts of spare time.
</P>
<P>
   Internet research fits in between Spanish lessons and
dinnertime, Barbies and Britney Spears. The speed of point, click
and read is invaluable to us in our research.
</P>
<P>
   I am a big fan of the public library, and I often check out
books and do research there. Our Internet connection enhances the
efforts of the school, the resources of the library and our
first-hand experience.
</P>
<P>
   Today, my second-grader and I talked about things you can learn
on the Internet. I suggested we look up some maps of Africa. I was
redirected to another topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we learn some Swahili words?'' she asked. ``We are working
on some Swahili words at school. Does the Internet know those words
or some more?''
</P>
<P>
   In a few clicks through one of my favorite sites for kids'
stuff, About.com (www.about.com), we found our way to reach what
she wanted to learn. We searched on the terms ``language'' and
``Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   My daughter saw ``jambo,'' a word meaning ``hello'' that she
learned at school. She also learned some new Swahili words. We
printed the list, and she will take it to school.
</P>
<P>
   Countless sites share kid-friendly information. If you care to
learn about animals, check out www.animalsearch
</P>
<P>
   .net. Some children may want to learn about the weather at
weathereye.kgan.com. Many who need general information can turn to
sites like www.edupuppy.com.
</P>
<P>
   The EduPuppy site is an educational resource for kids (and their
families), preschool through second grade. The prescreened database
of links includes great content and resources for teachers and
families.
</P>
<P>
   I feel comfortable using the Internet with my children. They are
too young to use it on their own. Just as I monitor their
television viewing, I help them with Web searching.
</P>
<P>
   The school-related resources go beyond homework help or
extracurricular lesson enhancement. Many schools, including ours,
have Web sites. Some include information about lunch menus, the
PTA, extracurricular activities, special events and more.
</P>
<P>
   The school sites can offer forgetful parents a way to keep up
with school activities even after they lose all the stacks of
paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   The technology continues to grow with multiplying Web sites,
faster computer speeds and more computers. I encourage my family to
have a growing level of comfort and familiarity with the
technology.
</P>
<P>
   I am thankful for the opportunity to keep up with my children's
lessons. If I want to look like a smart mom, I had better know the
elementary school lessons.

 &HT;    Combat Mission more like football than war
 &HT;    By Vox Day
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There have been at least four official attempts to
create a computer game modeled after ``Advanced Squad Leader,'' the
massively detailed and dauntingly encyclopedic board game of World
War II infantry combat.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these attempts has failed badly, in one way or another,
although one, ``Close Combat,'' has seen some level of success.
</P>
<P>
   While Big Time Software's ``Combat Mission'' is conceptually
quite different from ASL's turn-based, hex-mapped board game, it
actually succeeds in replicating much of ASL's intellectual
intensity. Set in the battles between U.S. troops and the Wehrmacht
following D-Day, the game play is fairly original, in that it uses
a 3-D environment as a backdrop for what is essentially a two-step
process of strategy and simultaneous resolution. This method hasn't
been used often, but in the case of ``Warlords III,'' to name one
example, it has been quite successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Combat Mission'' thus gets away from the ``I go, you go'' of
ASL and other war games, but it should not be confused with an
action game either. Perhaps the best way to think of it is like a
football game; each commander can plot his strategy and give orders
to each individual unit, then watch as the next 60 seconds of
combat unfold in full 3-D.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the strategic AI used by the computer player,
there is also a Tactical AI, (TACAI), which means your troops will
not follow your orders blindly but will modify them as the TACAI
deems necessary.
</P>
<P>
   This is good, as it's not possible to ignore the Sherman about
to overrun your machine gun position in favor of taking a
long-range shot at a distant artillery spotter. The designers
appear to be dedicated to combining entertainment with a high level
of realism, and the results are quite good.
</P>
<P>
   There are already Web sites where you can find re-creations of
classic ASL scenarios such as Gavin Take and Defiance on Hill 30,
made with the included battle editor.
</P>
<P>
   You can find these and others at
w1.312.telia.com/(tilde)u31213280/index.htm, while to buy ``Combat
Mission,'' you'll have to go directly to www.battlefront.com since
this self-published game is available only over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   If you like war games, ``Combat Mission: Beyond Overlord'' is
definitely one worth looking into.

 &HT;    Hoops, anyone?
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   While soft and squishy sports are often best suited to indoor
play, PlayHut's Shoot A Round basketball contraption ($22;
www.playhut.com functions well in any environment. Essentially a
wire and mesh pop-up box with a hoop, the modestly sized ``portable
basketball court'' practically erects itself (though collapsing the
unit can involve a rich lesson in origami) and comes complete with
four undersized balls. Shooting ``nuthin' but net'' returns a ball
down a funnel flume. Moreover, crashing the boards is an immensely
forgiving endeavor as the Shoot A Round will yield completely and
then sproing itself back into shape. A lot of fun for the whole
family.

 &HT;    Internet appliances a hot item
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jcki:
</P>
<P>
   I want to buy an Internet appliance to use at home for e-mail
and the Internet, but I've had trouble finding one even to look at.
An article I read highly recommended the iPAQ, which is made by
Compaq. Their Web site listed nearby stores that supposedly carry
it, but when I called no one had it and some didn't know what I was
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lynne Pickens, Decatur, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: The iPAQ Home Internet Appliance or MSN Home Companion, if
you're talking Microsoft (www.microsoft.com), is what some of us
might call a ``dumb terminal.'' Meaning, you get your data from a
server. Not much lives on the unit itself, but it has all you need
if you're mainly into the Web and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: It's Compaq's (www6.compaq.com/) answer to the Netpliance
i-opener, and people are raving about it. Keep it in your kitchen,
or plop it by your TV. Pop up the screen, plug it in and type away
at your wireless keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: It has dial-up Internet service, e-mail, instant messaging
and other MSN services. It handles attachments, plays MP3 audio
files and displays video using Windows Media.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: You're right when you say it's hard to find. We called
several Compaq retailers in the Atlanta area. Most don't carry it
and have no idea what it is. Or, if they have it, it's gone. Compaq
says that is because it's so popular and so durn new.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Sorry, we don't have an iPAQ IA tucked up our sleeve. Many
local retailers told us to call back on a Saturday, which is when
their new stock arrives. You may want to try that.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Meanwhile, let's check in on Netpliance's i-opener
(www.netpliance.com), the early mover in the Internet appliance
game. The i-opener 2001, billed as the new-generation IA, will
sport an enhancement or two when it ships in early October.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: It'll have multiple e-mail accounts this go-around. Up to
four. Netpliance also glommed onto software called Jabber and built
an instant-messaging system they tout. It has the ability to
``jabber'' _ or communicate _ with other instant-messaging systems,
such as AOL's.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: The tiny plug-and-play dealie has taken jabs for its price
fluctuations, though. A promotional offer of $99 for a membership
package a few months ago soared to $399, then dipped to $299.
There's a $21.95 monthly Internet service fee. But remember, you
gotta go with their ISP.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: If you recall, the first-generation i-opener disappeared
after it fell prey to hackers. Some folks figured out how to crack
open the Internet surfing machine with its wee chip and turn it
into a full-fledged, heckuva-deal computer by adding a hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd write for The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.

 &HT;    Take heart _ complicated gadgets will someday seem simple
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I walked into the massive Las Vegas casino auditorium
on opening day for a big consumer electronics show. On the
giant-screen TV there was a close-up video of a VCR with the clock
flashing in red: 00:00.
</P>
<P>
   Superimposed was this headline: ``The shame of our industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of us have trouble setting the time on a VCR or following
the instructions in the manual. Our gadgets are impossibly complex
and often don't work as well as they should.
</P>
<P>
   If your lawn mower were as cranky and complex as a home
computer, the world would be overgrown with weeds. And the
instructions for most gadgets read like the operation manual for a
747.
</P>
<P>
   Even when you follow the directions, your DVD or computer can
make you look like a fool.
</P>
<P>
   It happens to me. I'm not a great expert, but I've spent time
running control boards at commercial radio stations, have passed
FCC examinations and know enough to grab a soldering iron by the
cool end.
</P>
<P>
   But just the other night I tried to show a DVD movie on my home
theater system, and the television turned itself off every time I
tried to switch from the cable to the DVD player. My guest was a
Ph.D. scientist at Vanderbilt. Neither us could figure out why the
TV wouldn't work, nor could we figure why it suddenly began working
again.
</P>
<P>
   Why are things that complicated? There's an easy answer. Like
most easy answers, it isn't very satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Your gadgets are that complicated because they are, well, they
are complicated gadgets. Your PC is much more powerful than the
computer that went along on Apollo missions to the moon. That VCR _
now old tech _ is the offshoot of television broadcasting
technology that brought stunning changes to commercial TV. Your DVD
player is such a miracle it was literally considered impossible a
decade before it was introduced. Even your microwave oven is based
on the technology that made radar possible.
</P>
<P>
   Life and technological advances move at an incredible pace
today. Technologies once took decades to reach the ordinary person
_ and got refined along the way. Nowadays, complex gadgets are on
sale at the discount store while they're still warm from the lab.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that, over time, things will get better.
Technology follows a well-worn path through history, and if you
look down that path you'll see the future. Early home radios were a
mess. To tune them you had to fuss with various settings. There was
enough knob twiddling to make a safecracker proud.
</P>
<P>
   There were magazines aimed at early owners of radios and
televisions, offering tips on how to make them work. But things
eventually got better. When was the last time you needed to read
the manual for a radio or to take a class on how to operate a
television set?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there are some simple rules that may help.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every electronic gizmo you own has a microprocessor
brain. When things get really out of whack, you often can reset
that microprocessor by removing the power. For instance, the manual
for my big-screen television suggests that when the remote control
(it said ``when'' not ``if'') stops working to remove the batteries
to reset the processor. Read the instruction manual for your
gadget, and you may find it has a built-in reset switch that will
perform the same function.
</P>
<P>
   Don't assume you've done something wrong if you slavishly follow
the instructions and that gadget stubbornly refuses to work. Try
again. I can't explain why this is true any more than I can tell
you why my cat sometimes sleeps on the TV. But it works.
</P>
<P>
   If your home computer stops working, try restarting it. If it
works, avoid the natural temptation to fix the computer. Fixing
computers causes more damage than anything I know, including
dropping them.
</P>
<P>
   The most important rule is this: When you buy a new gadget, ask
to see the instruction manual. If you can't understand the manual,
don't buy the device.
</P>
<P>
   None of this advice should be necessary. Your DVD player should
be as simple to use as the telephone. Until that day comes, the
most important attributes needed are patience, a good sense of
humor and a 13-year-old child to fix the stuff you break.

 &HT;    New movie's Web site like strange dream
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After six or seven visits to the Requiem for a Dream
Web site, I still have no idea what it's about.
</P>
<P>
   It (www.requiemforadream.com) looks like a Web site for a TV
game show _ run by some inspirational Tony Robbins-like person who
hawks books and other things that are guaranteed to make you
richer, thinner, happier, loved and admired.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you try to click on one of the buttons to order a
book, be a contestant on the show or even sign the guest book, the
site disintegrates in front of your eyes. After it literally
vanishes off the screen, eerie music follows and the words
``Requiem for a Dream'' flash across the screen.
</P>
<P>
   And then it's over. Just like that. Just like a dream. You can't
go back. Sure, you can reload the site and try something different,
but the results will be the same.
</P>
<P>
   The site is confusing and very, very strange.
</P>
<P>
   But here's where I can let you in on a little secret.
Requiemforadream.com is really a promotional site for a movie of
the same name set to open in New York and Los Angeles in October
and nationwide later in the month.
</P>
<P>
   What's it about? Who knows.
</P>
<P>
   The site is produced by a New York company called Artisan
Entertainment _ the same people who had movie fans crowded around
their computer monitors last summer to watch the eerie trailer for
``The Blair Witch Project.'' It uses the same vague and spooky
techniques to stir up advance interest in this film from Sundance
Film Festival darling Darren Aronofsky, whose debut feature ``Pi''
was a big hit at the annual event.
</P>
<P>
   My personal search to discover what ``Requiem'' is about turned
into a scavenger hunt to nearly every movie and book site on the
Web. Is this the goal of the site's designers _ to intrigue Web
surfers to the point where there is no limit to the number of sites
they'll visit to find out what this movie is about? It could be.
</P>
<P>
   If that's how it works out, the filmmakers can turn around and
call it the most searched site on the Web. Has a nice marketing
ring to it, no question about it, but not everybody has this kind
of commitment. Or does this stuff for a living. And sometimes too
much information can be a dangerous thing.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this blurb from the production notes culled from the
Yahoo Movies Web site (movies.yahoo.com). Director Aronofsky said,
``One of the things this film is about is the hole we create in our
present when we chase the illusion of tomorrow and then the
distances we go to fill that vacuum with anything and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not much help, is it?
</P>
<P>
   Reading deeper into the production notes, we find the movie is
based on a novel by Hubert Selby Jr., who also wrote ``Last Exit to
Brooklyn,'' which also was made into a movie.
</P>
<P>
   A quick trip to Amazon.com reveals the book has a five-star
rating from Amazon's loyal cadre of readers and reviewers.
</P>
<P>
   One Amazon reader from London who loved the book described it as
one where things don't always turn out as they seem. ``This book
shows human determination in the extreme. Each person, with only
one thing in mind, does anything to sustain the dream, deceiving
each other and themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   If you feel you need to read the book before experiencing the
Web site of the actual movie, Amazon has it on sale for $13.45,
excluding shipping, of course. You can also pre-order the ``Requiem
for a Dream soundtrack, while you're at it, if the techno-gothic
music you've heard on the Web site appeals to you.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Artisan Entertainment suggests viewing the
trailer for the movie at www.requiemforadream.
com/equiemtrailer.mov. ``Enjoy the trippy experience!'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it sure is trippy. The Quicktime video is a fast-paced
montage of images _ some beautiful, some creepy and some just plain
odd. And it still provides no real description of what this movie
is about.
</P>
<P>
   Now, what I've been able to conclude from all this Web surfing
sparked by a very mysterious Web site is that ``Requiem for a
Dream'' is a beautiful but disturbing film that probably makes some
interesting points about the lengths people will go to attain
ultimate happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Now as Dennis Miller likes to say, ``That's just my opinion. I
could be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But trying to find the answers sent me off on a fascinating
search.
</P>
<P>
   That's probably what Artisan Entertainment and the film's
producers wanted me to do _ get so hooked on finding out about the
film and finding nothing that I go to the movie just to get a plot
summary if nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows, it just might work.

 &HT;    Thrills from `Spider-Man' worthy of classic comic
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Spider-Man '' is the latest superhero to come to the
rescue of the PlayStation console system.
</P>
<P>
   With the public's ever-mounting anticipation for next month's
arrival of the PlayStation 2 in retail stores, Sony's original
system has almost become a forgotten item.
</P>
<P>
   Just as ``Spider-Man'' always rushes to the aid of New York
City, he does the same for PlayStation. The $39.99 video game by
Activision is one of the best action-adventure games of the year _
on any system.
</P>
<P>
   The game's developers deserve credit, first and foremost, for
sticking as closely as possible to the heroic character in Stan
Lee's legendary comic book series. Spider-Man is definitely true to
himself in the game, right down to his sarcastic comments such as
``Maybe you ought to fight next time'' after knocking out an
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The plot of ``Spider-Man,'' which has 34 levels, is simple:
Protect the Big Apple from villains. The fighting locations include
such familiar places as the Daily Bugle, Times Square and a New
York bank.
</P>
<P>
   Loyal followers of Spider-Man know that the web-slinging wizard
is most effective with finesse moves _ and not by overpowering an
opponent. You must keep this strategy in mind when playing the
video game.
</P>
<P>
   Players can shoot webs to swing from building to building. They
can climb on the side of walls and from upside down to secretly
view and surprise the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Spider-Man's weaponry includes the traditional web-trapping,
along with being able to launch an impact web to knock the villains
off their feet.
</P>
<P>
   There are also a few new items in Spider-Man's arsenal, most
notably the ``Web Dome.'' When surrounded by foes, the superhero
forms an igloo-shaped dome around himself made of web, which
explodes seconds later and damages everything in its path.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spider-Man'' has a quick learning curve, even for those not
familiar with the comic book. Allies such as Dare Devil and Black
Cat seem to always be around to offer tips for new moves and tricks
to use in fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The story line of the game develops as you play, and gamers are
rewarded with full-motion videos between each level to enhance the
plot.

 &HT;    All-in-one browsers offer the Web, chat, e-mail and more
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Welcome to the era of the mega-browser.
</P>
<P>
   You may be thinking: ``What on earth is a megabrowser and why
would I ever want or need one? My trusty Netscape or Internet
Explorer browser works just fine, thank you very much.''
</P>
<P>
   But megabrowsers from big guns like Microsoft (which rolled out
its MSN Explorer browser earlier this month) and smaller companies
like the Norcross, Ga.-based Ultrabrowser are one of the hottest
Web trends today. The companies are hoping this new breed of
one-stop browser will foster Web loyalty that will last a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to provide one-stop shopping for busy Web users or
newcomers who don't have time to read up on all the Web has to
offer. These new browsers tuck almost every Internet task into one
neat package: Surfing, searching, instant messaging, shopping, news
and e-mail, audio, video and eventually phone service are all
there. All you have to do is download and go. The idea is to
develop a loyal audience that will keep coming back. That
translates into money because the more users any site or product
has, the more advertisers it attracts and the more money it's
possible to make.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape is also hoping to develop user loyalty with its latest
browser _ Netscape 6. It will incorporate many features of popular
parent company America Online. Among other things, Netscape 6 will
provide continuous and customized news updates automatically
``pushed'' to the user as well as links to AOL's instant messenger
software.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a slightly different tack is super portal Yahoo. Yahoo
has a new product called Yahoo Companion that will customize your
current browser with a Yahoo toolbar that contains the links you
specify. ``Y Companion'' will download a Yahoo toolbar and hook it
right into your current browser. If you are a Yahoo registered
user, you can also import other sites you've bookmarked and have
them turn up on the toolbar.
</P>
<P>
   This new crop of browsers is an attempt to create what is known
as ``stickiness.'' Remember when search engines just searched the
Web? There was a time when Yahoo, Lycos and the other major portals
had one purpose : Helping users find what they were looking for
elsewhere on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Then Web-measurement firm MediaMetrix developed data, later
supported by competing firm Nielsen/NetRatings, that users were
typing in search data, getting the information they wanted and then
leaving the sites so fast they were leaving virtual skid marks. If
you look at any of the major portals, you find a variety of things
to do there from checking the news to downloading music and even
keeping an online appointment calendar.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft Network online service was first out of the gate
with its superbrowser called the MSN Explorer browser. Although
it's still in the development stages, it can be downloaded at the
MSN Web site (www.msn.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did we do this?'' MSN Explorer's group program manager
Hillel Cooperman said to a skeptical group of analysts and
reporters at a demonstration in New York City. ``To get to the next
level this is what it's going to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooperman and his bosses at Microsoft already know that
developing software _ whether it is for the computer or the
Internet _ is what Microsoft is all about. Unlike Atlanta-based
EarthLink or AT&AMP;T's WorldNet, it knows the core business is not
access, it is giving consumers something useful and engaging to do
once they get to a site.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Internet service providers and anyone else focused on
catching up to AOL in terms of both subscribers and revenue, MSN is
targeting new computer and Web users who know they need to be
online but don't know exactly how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The online experience isn't simple,'' Cooperman said. He said
that three out of 12 users can't get online because they literally
cannot navigate the installation process. Research based on the old
MSN network showed that four out of 12 users gave up when trying to
install the software.
</P>
<P>
   MSN developed its new browser with a sharp eye on AOL. With AOL
at 25 million members, even its most bitter rivals are forced to
concede AOL is doing something right. ``AOL has been a pioneer at
integrating services,'' Cooperman said. ``People on AOL take the
Web for granted because AOL has harnessed everything into one
place.''
</P>
<P>
   So why reinvent the wheel? Microsoft has already built a suite
of Web sites and applications including Hotmail, HomeAdvisor,
Carpoint and MSN Money, which are considered to be among the top
Web sites in their respective categories.
</P>
<P>
   However, Cooperman says that the ``a la carte approach'' doesn't
work for everyone. While some users don't mind surfing the Web to
find and bookmark the sites they want, other people _ and many of
the 25 million AOL users would be in this group _ like having
everything prepackaged for them.
</P>
<P>
   MSN Explorer is a browser that users can download and install
for free. It looks like Microsoft's conventional browser, the
Internet Explorer, but it also includes a personal start page users
can customize. From there you have one-stop access to your Hotmail
or MSN e-mail account, local weather and links to all the MSN
properties. Also included in the package is Windows Media, an audio
and video player that lets users listen to music or watch streaming
videos while they work.There's a music icon on the toolbar that
lets users select from hundreds of radio stations all around the
world. Newbies will appreciate how easy it is to use, while
veterans will appreciate not having to hunt around for software or
download information.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the MSN browser is still in development, don't be
afraid to download it. It works well, appears to be bug-free and
doesn't reconfigure any of the settings already on your computer.
It's also attractive and fun to use, even for grizzled vets.
</P>
<P>
   The collection of information and integration of Web
applications makes going online a lot easier for new users and
old-timers alike.
</P>
<P>
   There's no hunting around for software plug-ins or being
overwhelmed with windows, buttons and strange new terms like
``keyword'' or ``IM.'' You can start listening to music or writing
e-mail the minute you log on. You can also register for MSN's
Passport service, which remembers your user name and password so
you don't have to as you travel across MSN sites and others that
use the Passport system.
</P>
<P>
   MSN has also customized the browser to reflect the city you live
in. New York users get a nice shot of the Manhattan skyline, while
Atlanta users get to see their own personal skyline. It's a small
thing but does personalize the Web. Also included in the service is
the MSN messenger, and a phone service is on the way. Users can
purchase Internet access from MSN directly or they can just use MSN
Explorer with any ISP they currently have instead of launching a
conventional browser.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia Loizides, a Web technology analyst with Jupiter
Communications, says the MSN Explorer is not AOL, but it's not a
Web browser, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really call it a browser,'' she says. ``It's
inherently different.The browser is in the background. They are
delivering a new kind of user interface and trying to make things
as simple as possible for somebody coming fresh onto the Web who
doesn't want to fuss with a whole lot of windows.''
</P>
<P>
   At the MSN demonstration in New York, the company went to great
pains to show how many windows it might take to get something done
on AOL. No windows burst open with MSN Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Personalization that really makes a browser look like it was
built just for you is also the goal of a Norcross-based firm called
Ultrabrowser.com. Ultrabrowser is hoping Web surfers are tired
looking at the big Netscape ``N'' or the little Microsoft windows
icon twirling around in their browser windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've done is create an Internet environment,'' says
Yassine Sbiti company founder, interim president and chief
executive. ``We've incorporated a search engine, directories,
access to TV and radio and an area you can customize.''
</P>
<P>
   You can download a plain ``vanilla'' version of Ultrabrowser
right now at its Web site (www.ultrabrowser.com). Ultrabrowser's
goal is to customize its product for companies and organizations
all over the world. For example, a university might have
Ultrabrowser design a browser with the school's logo that it will
distribute free on its home page or via CDs given to students,
alumni and others. The ``skin'' or on-screen appearance will be
tailored for an institution or company and the start page will
always be the company's home page.
</P>
<P>
   Sbiti says the schools, companies and organizations distributing
Ultrabrowser bring a whole new dimension to branding on the Web.
``It's a different thing entirely,'' he says. ``You used to be a
Web site. Now you're a browser.''
</P>
<P>
   What both these new megabrowsers want to do is attract loyal
users and hold them. MSN is hoping its suite of sites and services
will win hearts. Ultrabrowser is hoping the idea of a personalized
look and feel combined with services will entice users. For Yahoo,
an ever-present toolbar will generate more users than the Web site
alone. As for Netscape, just looking a little bit like AOL will go
a long way toward holding on to its users.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter's Loizides said loyalty is the name of the game when it
comes to customer retention.
</P>
<P>
   ``MSN is trying to build relationships with the client and the
Internet and they're betting you'll invest all this time in the
site,'' she said. ``They're hoping you won't want to take all the
photos you've uploaded to your personal photo albums and take them
to another site.''
</P>
<P>
   While these sites may build loyalty, it could still be too
little too late if MSN or anybody else wants to catch AOL, she
believes:
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so far ahead, does that mean there's no hope of MSN
or anyone else catching up? This may not be the golden arrow that's
going to get them up to AOL's numbers. But if they can parallel the
types of services AOL has, then they are on an even playing field.
And if you have a great interface and have all the features rolled
up into one place and boom it's right in front of you, that's
something.''

 &HT;    Internet's elementary lessons reach from near to far away
 &HT;    By Anne Meyers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ My children attend a school in our community. Our
school launches them on trips far and near. Some of those trips are
off-site field trips by bus. Many are classroom-based journeys to
faraway worlds.
</P>
<P>
   With their current studies, one child takes field trips to
places in our community while the other learns about places like
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   This week my oldest child enjoyed a lesson about Kenya when her
librarian shared stories of her real-life travels. Looking at the
librarian's travel treasures was an exciting lesson for the
children.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers cover thousands of miles from their classrooms.
These study units include places I have visited and learned about.
There are other times when my children learn about things that I am
unfamiliar with that I need to learn about. If I want to be a part
of their teaching, I need to share in their studies.
</P>
<P>
   My children show enthusiasm for their learning, owed in great
part to their schools and teachers. They introduce me to lessons
that enrich my knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, I might one day be a solid contender for ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is my quick trip to self-motivated study hall.
Together my kids and I can work on studies and outside interests.
Current plans for one child include a field trip to the Tullie
Smith Farm (www.atlhist.org
</P>
<P>
   /HousesGardens/html/tulliesmith.htm) and lessons about places
and people in our community.
</P>
<P>
   The Tullie Smith Farm description on the Web was useful to me. I
am not a native Atlantan, and before I had school-age children had
never heard of the place. Now, armed with a description from the
Atlanta History Center, I understand where the Tullie Smith Farm is
located and what its purpose is for a field trip.
</P>
<P>
   My other child's study of Africa allows us to search Web sites
for facts about the continent.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Internet research so special for us is that we can do
it together in our small amounts of spare time.
</P>
<P>
   Internet research fits in between Spanish lessons and
dinnertime, Barbies and Britney Spears. The speed of point, click
and read is invaluable to us in our research.
</P>
<P>
   I am a big fan of the public library, and I often check out
books and do research there. Our Internet connection enhances the
efforts of the school, the resources of the library and our
first-hand experience.
</P>
<P>
   Today, my second-grader and I talked about things you can learn
on the Internet. I suggested we look up some maps of Africa. I was
redirected to another topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we learn some Swahili words?'' she asked. ``We are working
on some Swahili words at school. Does the Internet know those words
or some more?''
</P>
<P>
   In a few clicks through one of my favorite sites for kids'
stuff, About.com (www.about.com), we found our way to reach what
she wanted to learn. We searched on the terms ``language'' and
``Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   My daughter saw ``jambo,'' a word meaning ``hello'' that she
learned at school. She also learned some new Swahili words. We
printed the list, and sh will take it to school.
</P>
<P>
   Countless sites share kid-friendly information. If you care to
learn about animals, check out www.animalsearch
</P>
<P>
   .net. Some children may want to learn about the weather at
weathereye.kgan.com. Many who need general information can turn to
sites like www.edupuppy.com.
</P>
<P>
   The EduPuppy site is an educational resource for kids (and their
families), preschool through second grade. The prescreened database
of links includes great content and resources for teachers and
families.
</P>
<P>
   I feel comfortable using the Internet with my children. They are
too young to use it on their own. Just as I monitor their
television viewing, I help them with Web searching.
</P>
<P>
   The school-related resources go beyond homework help or
extracurricular lesson enhancement. Many schools, including ours,
have Web sites. Some include information about lunch menus, the
PTA, extracurricular activities, special events and more.
</P>
<P>
   The school sites can offer forgetful parents a way to keep up
with school activities even after they lose all the stacks of
paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   The technology continues to grow with multiplying Web sites,
faster computer speeds and more computers. I encourage my family to
have a growing level of comfort and familiarity with the
technology.
</P>
<P>
   I am thankful for the opportunity to keep up with my children's
lessons. If I want to look like a smart mom, I had better know the
elementary school lessons.

 &HT;    Combat Mission more like football than war
 &HT;    By Vox Day
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There have been at least four official attempts to
create a computer game modeled after ``Advanced Squad Leader,'' the
massively detailed and dauntingly encyclopedic board game of World
War II infantry combat.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these attempts has failed badly, in one way or another,
although one, ``Close Combat,'' has seen some level of success.
</P>
<P>
   While Big Time Software's ``Combat Mission'' is conceptually
quite different from ASL's turn-based, hex-mapped board game, it
actually succeeds in replicating much of ASL's intellectual
intensity. Set in the battles between U.S. troops and the Wehrmacht
following D-Day, the game play is fairly original, in that it uses
a 3-D environment as a backdrop for what is essentially a two-step
process of strategy and simultaneous resolution. This method hasn't
been used often, but in the case of ``Warlords III,'' to name one
example, it has been quite successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Combat Mission'' thus gets away from the ``I go, you go'' of
ASL and other war games, but it should not be confused with an
action game either. Perhaps the best way to think of it is like a
football game; each commander can plot his strategy and give orders
to each individual unit, then watch as the next 60 seconds of
combat unfold in full 3-D.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the strategic AI used by the computer player,
there is also a Tactical AI, (TACAI), which means your troops will
not follow your orders blindly but will modify them as the TACAI
deems necessary.
</P>
<P>
   This is good, as it's not possible to ignore the Sherman about
to overrun your machine gun position in favor of taking a
long-range shot at a distant artillery spotter. The designers
appear to be dedicated to combining entertainment with a high level
of realism, and the results are quite good.
</P>
<P>
   There are already Web sites where you can find re-creations of
classic ASL scenarios such as Gavin Take and Defiance on Hill 30,
made with the included battle editor.
</P>
<P>
   You can find these and others at
w1.312.telia.com/(tilde)u31213280/index.htm, while to buy ``Combat
Mission,'' you'll have to go directly to www.battlefront.com since
this self-published game is available only over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   If you like war games, ``Combat Mission: Beyond Overlord'' is
definitely one worth looking into.

 &HT;    Internet appliances a hot item
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I want to buy an Internet appliance to use at home for e-mail
and the Internet, but I've had trouble finding one even to look at.
An article I read highly recommended the iPAQ, which is made by
Compaq. Their Web site listed nearby stores that supposedly carry
it, but when I called no one had it and some didn't know what I was
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lynne Pickens, Decatur, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: The iPAQ Home Internet Appliance or MSN Home Companion, if
you're talking Microsoft (www.microsoft.com), is what some of us
might call a ``dumb terminal.'' Meaning, you get your data from a
server. Not much lives on the unit itself, but it has all you need
if you're mainly into the Web and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: It's Compaq's (www6.compaq.com/) answer to the Netpliance
i-opener, and people are raving about it. Keep it in your kitchen,
or plop it by your TV. Pop up the screen, plug it in and type away
at your wireless keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: It has dial-up Internet service, e-mail, instant messaging
and other MSN services. It handles attachments, plays MP3 audio
files and displays video using Windows Media.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: You're right when you say it's hard to find. We called
several Compaq retailers in the Atlanta area. Most don't carry it
and have no idea what it is. Or, if they have it, it's gone. Compaq
says that is because it's so popular and so durn new.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Sorry, we don't have an iPAQ IA tucked up our sleeve. Many
local retailers told us to call back on a Saturday, which is when
their new stock arrives. You may want to try that.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Meanwhile, let's check in on Netpliance's i-opener
(www.netpliance.com), the early mover in the Internet appliance
game. The i-opener 2001, billed as the new-generation IA, will
sport an enhancement or two when it ships in early October.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: It'll have multiple e-mail accounts this go-around. Up to
four. Netpliance also glommed onto software called Jabber and built
an instant-messaging system they tout. It has the ability to
``jabber'' _ or communicate _ with other instant-messaging systems,
such as AOL's.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: The tiny plug-and-play dealie has taken jabs for its price
fluctuations, though. A promotional offer of $99 for a membership
package a few months ago soared to $399, then dipped to $299.
There's a $21.95 monthly Internet service fee. But remember, you
gotta go with their ISP.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: If you recall, the first-generation i-opener disappeared
after it fell prey to hackers. Some folks figured out how to crack
open the Internet surfing machine with its wee chip and turn it
into a full-fledged, heckuva-deal computer by adding a hard drive.
</P>
<P>

Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.

 &HT;    Take heart _ complicated gadgets will someday seem simple
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I walked into the massive Las Vegas casino auditorium
on opening day for a big consumer electronics show. On the
giant-screen TV there was a close-up video of a VCR with the clock
flashing in red: 00:00.
</P>
<P>
   Superimposed was this headline: ``The shame of our industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of us have trouble setting the time on a VCR or following
the instructions in the manual. Our gadgets are impossibly complex
and often don't work as well as they should.
</P>
<P>
   If your lawn mower were as cranky and complex as a home
computer, the world would be overgrown with weeds. And the
instructions for most gadgets read like the operation manual for a
747.
</P>
<P>
   Even when you follow the directions, your DVD or computer can
make you look like a fool.
</P>
<P>
   It happens to me. I'm not a great expert, but I've spent time
running control boards at commercial radio stations, have passed
FCC examinations and know enough to grab a soldering iron by the
cool end.
</P>
<P>
   But just the other night I tried to show a DVD movie on my home
theater system, and the television turned itself off every time I
tried to switch from the cable to the DVD player. My guest was a
Ph.D. scientist at Vanderbilt. Neither us could figure out why the
TV wouldn't work, nor could we figure why it suddenly began working
again.
</P>
<P>
   Why are things that complicated? There's an easy answer. Like
most easy answers, it isn't very satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Your gadgets are that complicated because they are, well, they
are complicated gadgets. Your PC is much more powerful than the
computer that went along on Apollo missions to the moon. That VCR _
now old tech _ is the offshoot of television broadcasting
technology that brought stunning changes to commercial TV. Your DVD
player is such a miracle it was literally considered impossible a
decade before it was introduced. Even your microwave oven is based
on the technology that made radar possible.
</P>
<P>
   Life and technological advances move at an incredible pace
today. Technologies once took decades to reach the ordinary person
_ and got refined along the way. Nowadays, complex gadgets are on
sale at the discount store while they're still warm from the lab.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that, over time, things will get better.
Technology follows a well-worn path through history, and if you
look down that path you'll see the future. Early home radios were a
mess. To tune them you had to fuss with various settings. There was
enough knob twiddling to make a safecracker proud.
</P>
<P>
   There were magazines aimed at early owners of radios and
televisions, offering tips on how to make them work. But things
eventually got better. When was the last time you needed to read
the manual for a radio or to take a class on how to operate a
television set?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there are some simple rules that may help.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every electronic gizmo you own has a microprocessor
brain. When things get really out of whack, you often can reset
that microprocessor by removing the power. For instance, the manual
for my big-screen television suggests that when the remote control
(it said ``when'' not ``if'') stops working to remove the batteries
to reset the processor. Read the instruction manual for your
gadget, and you may find it has a built-in reset switch that will
perform the same function.
</P>
<P>
   Don't assume you've done something wrong if you slavishly follow
the instructions and that gadget stubbornly refuses to work. Try
again. I can't explain why this is true any more than I can tell
you why my cat sometimes sleeps on the TV. But it works.
</P>
<P>
   If your home computer stops working, try restarting it. If it
works, avoid the natural temptation to fix the computer. Fixing
computers causes more damage than anything I know, including
dropping them.
</P>
<P>
   The most important rule is this: When you buy a new gadget, ask
to see the instruction manual. If you can't understand the manual,
don't buy the device.
</P>
<P>
   None of this advice should be necessary. Your DVD player should
be as simple to use as the telephone. Until that day comes, the
most important attributes needed are patience, a good sense of
humor and a 13-year-old child to fix the stuff you break.

   Consumer Q&AMP;ABy Jane Greigc. 2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: It has dipped down into the 90s and there is
a touch of fall in the air (ha ha). I need the recipe
(water-to-floor-wax ratio) for a pine cones and floor wax project.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rick S.
</P>
<P>
   A: No water. Dip pine cones in liquid floor wax (yes, floor wax)
and shake off the excess. Place the dipped pine cones on newspapers
(but not over this column). While they are still damp, sprinkle
with Rainbow Flame Crystals. Let dry. Toss one of your new and
improved pine cones into the fire and enjoy. Q: About ads like this
one: ``ENVELOPE STUFFERS NEEDED! Earn $500-$3,500 weekly from your
home, stuffing envelopes,'' etc. Well, my dad responded to some of
these ads, but they were asking for an initial cost of processing
($20-$40). My dad guessed that if about a million people responded
and sent money, they'd be collecting millions.
</P>
<P>
   Are these companies honest?
</P>
<P>
   _ Rachel B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure _ honest about getting your money. The tip-off? Asking
for money to start for something that sounds soooo easy _ stuffing
an envelope. The Federal Trade Commission warns consumers that the
``offer'' is usually nothing but instructions on placing a similar
ad to hook other consumers.
</P>
<P>
   If stuffing work is indeed offered, often the work is deemed
unacceptable or not up to quality standards and the promoters
simply refuse to pay. If there is an honest envelope-stuffing
business, I have yet to encounter it. To find out more, visit
www.ftc.gov.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would you know the date Elvis appeared in Austin last? He
stayed at the Hilton Inn because I gave him the President's Suite
to use during his stay _ he gave me the key back, which I still
have.
</P>
<P>
   _ David P.
</P>
<P>
   A: March 28, 1977. The place? Municipal Auditorium. The hound
dog's single show entertained 6,000 fans _ each of whom paid $12.75
or $15.25 for a ticket. (Those were the days.)
</P>
<P>
   The King did indeed sleep at the Hilton, in the Governor's Room
on the ninth floor for a mere $180. The usual frenzy ensued after
the King left the hotel _ offers for his pillow and used towels
made headlines. Guess your key is quite the souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I need to get Ty Detmer's address or e-mail as soon as
possible. Ty is a quarterback for the Cleveland Browns. Just like
him, I ruptured my right Achilles' tendon and will be out of
commission for a whole year. I would like to empathize with him.
</P>
<P>
   _ Robert D. Martinez
</P>
<P>
   A: Ouch! Detmer is out for the season, but you can still send
missives to him at 76 Lou Groza Blvd., Berea, Ohio 44017. The San
Marcos-born quarterback attended Southwest High School in San
Antonio before making his mark at Brigham Young University.
Currently in his ninth NFL season, Detmer spent his rookie season
with the Green Bay Packers. Q: Why does our police department have
``POLICE'' printed on the top front of the police car hoods upside
down and backward? Do they all have dyslexia, or did a drunken
painter get his stencil backward?
</P>
<P>
   _ Mrs. Wynne T.
</P>
<P>
   A: Police cars, like ambulances, have the odd-looking stencil
for a good, clever reason _ safety.
</P>
<P>
   Check out these vehicles in your car's rearview mirror and the
word ``police'' or ``ambulance'' is easy to read, notes APD
spokeswoman Laura Albrecht. Vehicles are required by law to pull to
the right when an emergency vehicle approaches in transit (flashing
lights, etc.).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a Civil War buff and am especially interested in things
that took place in Texas in that period. In ``The Civil War'' by
Shelby Foote, it states, ``Factories at Tyler, Houston, and Austin
together with one at Washington, Arkansas, were delivering 10,000
pairs of shoes a month to rebel quartermasters . . .'' Where could
I obtain information about the location of the shoe factory that
was in operation at that time in Austin?
</P>
<P>
   _ Mary Dees
</P>
<P>
   A: Several sources (``The Handbook of Texas,'' ``Texas &AMP; Texans
in the Civil War'' by Ralph Wooster) agree with Foote. Austin was
the site of a Confederate Depot producing shoes during the Civil
War. No word, however, on its location. Usual sources such as the
Austin History Center could not place it. The State Archives
Information Services Division did turn up the names of Austinites
who had these contracts, J.R. Catterton (1863) and R.O. Blair
(1863-64). Hey, readers, anyone have this shoe factory location in
family lore?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Over the last year or so, I have seen loops formed in cable
television lines that run between telephone poles. Do you know the
purpose of these loops?
</P>
<P>
   _ Brent G. Smith
</P>
<P>
   A: Good eye. There are thousands of miles of cable in the area
to maintain. Repairing cable is like mending a broken shoelace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you noticed there are two different types of loops?''
asks Lidia Agraz of Time Warner Cable.
</P>
<P>
   One is a loop in the cable line (silver) that serves to prevent
breaks or sags as the line expands or contracts with temperature
changes. Other loops of fiber optic cable (slack band) allow for
easy addition of fiber and repairs (e.g. splicing).
</P>
<P>
   Q: My favorite TV show _ and considering the competition, that's
not much of a compliment _ ``Jeopardy!,'' does err occasionally.
While this does not detract from its quality, I occasionally
witness it. I would like to inform them, but I have been unable to
find an address. By the way, your column is not all that shabby.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kirk M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Thanks for the faint praise. Just as I suspected, everyone is
an editor! The address is 10202 W. Washington Blvd., Culver City,
Calif. 90232-3195.
</P>
<P>
   The writers bring experience from other quiz shows (e.g. ``Card
Sharks,'' ``Tic Tac Dough'' and ``Hollywood Squares''). They
delight in creating daffy categories such as ``Those Darn
Etruscans'' and ``Stupid Answers.'' The trivia team is led by the
Canadian-born and recent official American citizen (1999) Alex
``my-personal-hero-is-Mark-Twain'' Trebek. Q: My puppy chewed up my
boyfriend's favorite hat, and I would like to replace it. It was a
gold lame baseball cap. The tag said ``A. Brod Fashion Accessories,
Made in U.S.A.'' Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Shelli Miller
</P>
<P>
   A: Not a look everyone can wear. Replace your boyfriend's
baseball cap by calling Southern Importers at (713) 524-8236. At a
mere $4.95 (no minimum: order one, order 100), you can afford it if
your puppy mauls another cap.
</P>
<P>
   Contact Jane Greig, author of ``Thanks for Asking,'' at P.O. Box
670, Austin, TX, 78767; (512) 445-3697; e-mail
jgreig(at)statesman.com or fax (512) 445-3968. Due to the number of
inquiries, Jane cannot respond to every request.

 &HT;    The Reagan Memorial _ There they go again
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Alexander Hamilton was not nearly as
likable as Ronald Reagan. He was vain, sneaky and had to let
everybody know he was the smartest guy in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, I know: He laid the foundation for the American economic
system and kept the nation fiscally afloat when we were a mere
start-up venture. But born illegitimate and dead in a duel? And
that nasty negative campaign against Thomas Jefferson? And the hush
money paid after an adulterous affair? Is this a role model for
children?
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the Reagan Legacy Project wants an engraving of Reagan
winking at us from the front of the $10 bill. It's a family values
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan Legacy Project has the broader goal of getting
governments _ federal, state, local and foreign _ to name roads,
buildings and inanimate objects in general after Reagan. The $10
bill is one of their more ambitious goals. (And what could they do
to top that? Rename a state?)
</P>
<P>
   On a more modest scale, the movement to rename, name and
memorialize in honor of Reagan is meeting with success. In Florida,
there's the Ronald Reagan Turnpike and Miami's Ronald Reagan
Avenue. In Washington, there's the airport and the Ronald Reagan
Building and International Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   And Republicans in Congress want to waive the dead-for-25-years
rule and other inconvenient restrictions on Mall memorials to make
way for a Reagan Monument among the Jefferson, Lincoln and
Washington monuments. The legislation recently passed the House
Resources Committee and backers hope for approval before Congress
adjourns.
</P>
<P>
   Let people call this ``a do-nothing Congress'' after that
accomplishment!
</P>
<P>
   But regardless of how warmly folks might remember the Reagan
years, there's something about the whole commemorative movement
that should call out the Irony Squad.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't Reagan the president who said we'd be better off with
fewer buildings full of government workers, public works projects
and focus on Washington?
</P>
<P>
   So how are politicians honoring his memory? By putting his name
on buildings full of government workers and on government
public-works projects. Plus, a memorial in the heart of D.C.
</P>
<P>
   There they go again.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the Name it for Reagan Movement, it's easy to wonder
about this tendency to name things after political leaders to the
exclusion of everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   We as a people tend to ridicule our leaders, razz politicians
and believe the worst of people we elect. Yet, when it comes to
naming buildings, christening roads and generally putting up signs,
nobody but a politician will do. Preferably a politician of the
immediately preceding generation.
</P>
<P>
   It's as though we feel bad for the way we treated them and want
to make up for it.
</P>
<P>
   In other countries, they seem better able to honor people
outside the government. Foreign currencies, for example, show
artists, musicians and writers. But here in America, we spend
politician money exclusively. (OK, except for the new Sacagawea
dollar, which is so cool people hoard it rather than spend it.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, I'd keep Hamilton on the $10. He's a handsome devil, even
if he was mean to Jefferson. On the redesigned bills, he looks
younger, snappier and perhaps just a little more smug than on the
old bills.
</P>
<P>
   But if he's got to go, then in a Reaganesque tribute to private
achievement, I would replace him with someone from the private
sector _ Thomas Edison, Mark Twain, Babe Ruth or somebody.
</P>
<P>
   I know, a lot of the people supporting this sort of thing are
from the government and they're here to help. But it's getting out
of hand.
</P>
<P>
   That's Reagan's name, don't wear it out.

 &HT;    Don't let the facts get in the way of ignorance
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ ``Ignorant folks,'' my father used to say,
``are not stupid _ they're just uninformed in some areas. Still,
they're mighty good at finger-pointing and name-calling. But,''
he'd remind me, ``always remember
</P>
<P>
   they're voicing their own fears, not their knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, I must have heard this at least a hundred times.
The first I recall was the day I came home from kindergarten crying
because a mean kid named Hermie had made fun of me for carrying a
man-sized handkerchief in my dress pocket. I told him I needed it.
I had hay fever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oo-ooh!'' rotten Hermie wailed, clapping a hand over his nose
and announcing to the rest of the five-year-olds in the color
circle (that's where we sat on the floor rolling balls around and
hollering: Red! Blue! Purkle!), Lizzie's got hay fever!''
</P>
<P>
   The circle receded in horror as I tried to explain that no one
could catch it, it was just an allergy. I should have saved my
breath, but at the time I was too young to realize there would
always be folks around who didn't want to
</P>
<P>
   be confused with the facts. When nap time came, my friend Janet
wouldn't even put her rug down next to mine because her mom had
told her not to hang out with runny-nosed kids.
</P>
<P>
   That's the first ``ignorance'' talk I remember having with my
father. He explained how a lack of knowledge frightens some folks.
Daddy was kinder than I. Next day I went to school and started a
rumor that Hermie had leprosy and his fingers and toes were going
to fall off. We'd been talking about it in Sunday school and I
remembered all the gory details.
</P>
<P>
   Daddy wouldn't have approved, but let me tell you, I felt GOOD
when Hermie had to play trucks all by himself that afternoon
because no one wanted to risk having assorted body parts drop off
in the sandbox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Susie called me a `slut' on the way to school, Ms. Schuett,''
Candy, a pretty little 8th-grader sobbed one morning as she swept
into my classroom. ``Am I a slut?'' I remember slipping an arm
around her shoulders and maneuvering the
</P>
<P>
   heart-broken child into the chair beside my desk. As I supplied
tissues and waited for the histrionics to subside, I silently
thanked the smut peddlers who substitute slime for talent, and aim
it at our kids. Then I called Susie in
</P>
<P>
   for a chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candy says you called her a slut. Is that true?'' Susie hemmed
and hawed, and then confessed she had indeed labeled her friend a
loose woman. When I asked why, Susie shrugged. I tried again. ``Did
you mean to call her a prostitute?''
</P>
<P>
   Susie was dumbfounded. It took her a minute to find her voice
and when she did, she began explaining to me that wasn't the
meaning of slut. I asked what is was then. ``It means someone who
makes you mad and talks about you behind your back because she's
trying to steal your boyfriend,'' Susie pronounced, secure in the
knowledge of what she thought she knew. I shook my head and handed
her the Webster's Unabridged, hoping at least she knew how to spell
what she'd been calling her friend. She did. And she was shocked
when I had her read the definition aloud.
</P>
<P>
   Susie apologized to Candy and by lunch they were giggling on the
same bench.
</P>
<P>
   It's Hermie and Susie and Candy I'm reminded of as I read this
morning about some folks in Cuzco, Peru, wanting to banish their
flag because it too closely resembles the gay-pride banner.
Visiting dignitaries, they complain, have
</P>
<P>
   refused to be photographed in front of it.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Hawaii has replaced the rainbow they sported
for so many years on their football helmets, with an ``H,'' and
changed their names from the Rainbow Warriors to just, Warriors.
Guess they'd finally had it with snide
</P>
<P>
   finger-pointers and name-callers. That's understandable.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still a sad fact of life that no matter how educated
some folks get to be, they remain driven by their fears and
blissful ignorance.

 &HT;    Hoops, anyone?
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   While soft and squishy sports are often best suited to indoor
play, PlayHut's Shoot A Round basketball contraption ($22;
www.playhut.com functions well in any environment. Essentially a
wire and mesh pop-up box with a hoop, the modestly sized ``portable
basketball court'' practically erects itself (though collapsing the
unit can involve a rich lesson in origami) and comes complete with
four undersized balls. Shooting ``nuthin' but net'' returns a ball
down a funnel flume. Moreover, crashing the boards is an immensely
forgiving endeavor as the Shoot A Round will yield completely and
then sproing itself back into shape. A lot of fun for the whole
family.

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Bill Clinton's presidency was stolen from him.
That's more or less official now that independent counsel Robert
Ray has declared that Whitewater, the ``scandal'' that launched a
thousand supposed scandals, was no scandal at all. (Teepen, Cox
News Service.)
</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ ``Ignorant folks,'' my
father used to say, ``are not stupid _ they're just uninformed in
some areas. Still, they're mighty good at finger-pointing and
name-calling. But,'' he'd remind me, ``always remember they're
voicing their own fears, not their knowledge.'' Over the years, I
must have heard this at least a hundred times. (Schuett, Cox News
Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   LANE-COLUMN _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Alexander Hamilton was not
nearly as likable as Ronald Reagan. He was vain, sneaky and had to
let everybody know he was the smartest guy in the room. Yeah, I
know: He laid the foundation for the American economic system and
kept the nation fiscally afloat when we were a mere start-up
venture. But born illegitimate and dead in a duel? And that nasty
negative campaign against Thomas Jefferson? And the hush money paid
after an adulterous affair? Is this a role model for children?

   Consumer Q&AMP;ABy Jane Greigc. 2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: It has dipped down into the 90s and there is
a touch of fall in the air (ha ha). I need the recipe
(water-to-floor-wax ratio) for a pine cones and floor wax project.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rick S.
</P>
<P>
   A: No water. Dip pine cones in liquid floor wax (yes, floor wax)
and shake off the excess. Place the dipped pine cones on newspapers
(but not over this column). While they are still damp, sprinkle
with Rainbow Flame Crystals. Let dry. Toss one of your new and
improved pine cones into the fire and enjoy. Q: About ads like this
one: ``ENVELOPE STUFFERS NEEDED! Earn $500-$3,500 weekly from your
home, stuffing envelopes,'' etc. Well, my dad responded to some of
these ads, but they were asking for an initial cost of processing
($20-$40). My dad guessed that if about a million people responded
and sent money, they'd be collecting millions.
</P>
<P>
   Are these companies honest?
</P>
<P>
   _ Rachel B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure _ honest about getting your money. The tip-off? Asking
for money to start for something that sounds soooo easy _ stuffing
an envelope. The Federal Trade Commission warns consumers that the
``offer'' is usually nothing but instructions on placing a similar
ad to hook other consumers.
</P>
<P>
   If stuffing work is indeed offered, often the work is deemed
unacceptable or not up to quality standards and the promoters
simply refuse to pay. If there is an honest envelope-stuffing
business, I have yet to encounter it. To find out more, visit
www.ftc.gov.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would you know the date Elvis appeared in Austin last? He
stayed at the Hilton Inn because I gave him the President's Suite
to use during his stay _ he gave me the key back, which I still
have.
</P>
<P>
   _ David P.
</P>
<P>
   A: March 28, 1977. The place? Municipal Auditorium. The hound
dog's single show entertained 6,000 fans _ each of whom paid $12.75
or $15.25 for a ticket. (Those were the days.)
</P>
<P>
   The King did indeed sleep at the Hilton, in the Governor's Room
on the ninth floor for a mere $180. The usual frenzy ensued after
the King left the hotel _ offers for his pillow and used towels
made headlines. Guess your key is quite the souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I need to get Ty Detmer's address or e-mail as soon as
possible. Ty is a quarterback for the Cleveland Browns. Just like
him, I ruptured my right Achilles' tendon and will be out of
commission for a whole year. I would like to empathize with him.
</P>
<P>
   _ Robert D. Martinez
</P>
<P>
   A: Ouch! Detmer is out for the season, but you can still send
missives to him at 76 Lou Groza Blvd., Berea, Ohio 44017. The San
Marcos-born quarterback attended Southwest High School in San
Antonio before making his mark at Brigham Young University.
Currently in his ninth NFL season, Detmer spent his rookie season
with the Green Bay Packers. Q: Why does our police department have
``POLICE'' printed on the top front of the police car hoods upside
down and backward? Do they all have dyslexia, or did a drunken
painter get his stencil backward?
</P>
<P>
   _ Mrs. Wynne T.
</P>
<P>
   A: Police cars, like ambulances, have the odd-looking stencil
for a good, clever reason _ safety.
</P>
<P>
   Check out these vehicles in your car's rearview mirror and the
word ``police'' or ``ambulance'' is easy to read, notes APD
spokeswoman Laura Albrecht. Vehicles are required by law to pull to
the right when an emergency vehicle approaches in transit (flashing
lights, etc.).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a Civil War buff and am especially interested in things
that took place in Texas in that period. In ``The Civil War'' by
Shelby Foote, it states, ``Factories at Tyler, Houston, and Austin
together with one at Washington, Arkansas, were delivering 10,000
pairs of shoes a month to rebel quartermasters . . .'' Where could
I obtain information about the location of the shoe factory that
was in operation at that time in Austin?
</P>
<P>
   _ Mary Dees
</P>
<P>
   A: Several sources (``The Handbook of Texas,'' ``Texas &AMP; Texans
in the Civil War'' by Ralph Wooster) agree with Foote. Austin was
the site of a Confederate Depot producing shoes during the Civil
War. No word, however, on its location. Usual sources such as the
Austin History Center could not place it. The State Archives
Information Services Division did turn up the names of Austinites
who had these contracts, J.R. Catterton (1863) and R.O. Blair
(1863-64). Hey, readers, anyone have this shoe factory location in
family lore?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Over the last year or so, I have seen loops formed in cable
television lines that run between telephone poles. Do you know the
purpose of these loops?
</P>
<P>
   _ Brent G. Smith
</P>
<P>
   A: Good eye. There are thousands of miles of cable in the area
to maintain. Repairing cable is like mending a broken shoelace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you noticed there are two different types of loops?''
asks Lidia Agraz of Time Warner Cable.
</P>
<P>
   One is a loop in the cable line (silver) that serves to prevent
breaks or sags as the line expands or contracts with temperature
changes. Other loops of fiber optic cable (slack band) allow for
easy addition of fiber and repairs (e.g. splicing).
</P>
<P>
   Q: My favorite TV show _ and considering the competition, that's
not much of a compliment _ ``Jeopardy!,'' does err occasionally.
While this does not detract from its quality, I occasionally
witness it. I would like to inform them, but I have been unable to
find an address. By the way, your column is not all that shabby.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kirk M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Thanks for the faint praise. Just as I suspected, everyone is
an editor! The address is 10202 W. Washington Blvd., Culver City,
Calif. 90232-3195.
</P>
<P>
   The writers bring experience from other quiz shows (e.g. ``Card
Sharks,'' ``Tic Tac Dough'' and ``Hollywood Squares''). They
delight in creating daffy categories such as ``Those Darn
Etruscans'' and ``Stupid Answers.'' The trivia team is led by the
Canadian-born and recent official American citizen (1999) Alex
``my-personal-hero-is-Mark-Twain'' Trebek. Q: My puppy chewed up my
boyfriend's favorite hat, and I would like to replace it. It was a
gold lame baseball cap. The tag said ``A. Brod Fashion Accessories,
Made in U.S.A.'' Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Shelli Miller
</P>
<P>
   A: Not a look everyone can wear. Replace your boyfriend's
baseball cap by calling Southern Importers at (713) 524-8236. At a
mere $4.95 (no minimum: order one, order 100), you can afford it if
your puppy mauls another cap.
</P>
<P>
   Contact Jane Greig, author of ``Thanks for Asking,'' at P.O. Box
670, Austin, TX, 78767; (512) 445-3697; e-mail
jgreig(at)statesman.com or fax (512) 445-3968. Due to the number of
inquiries, Jane cannot respond to every request.

U.S. SOFTBALL DEFEATS CHINA AND AUSTRALIA, WILL PLAY JAPAN FOR GOLD
MEDAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Ask the players on the U.S. softball team to
describe their first week at the Olympics, and they all use the
same word: nightmare. The team lost three games in a row,
shattering a 112-game winning streak and putting a gold medal
seemingly out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, however, the defending Olympic champions continued
their long climb out of the abyss, capitalizing on the fiery
pitching of Lisa Fernandez to beat Australia, 1-0, and advance to
the gold medal game on Tuesday against Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez struck out eight Australian hitters in a row between
the fourth and seventh innings. Her pitches had a combination of
speed _ some were clocked at 62 miles per hour _ and pinpoint
accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kept telling myself, `Oh God, please help me,''' said a
jubilant Fernandez after the game. ``It was actually a sense of
relief knowing that I held the outcome of the game in my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory over Australia was sweet for several reasons. It
came on the heels of the team's 1-0 victory over China in the
semifinals Monday morning. And it came over a team that had beaten
the United States, 2-1, last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have easily folded up our bags and said, `We're
done,' after the losses,'' said Stacey Nuveman, the catcher, who
drove in the game-winning run against China and had a crucial hit
in Monday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States seemed anything but rattled against
Australia. With Fernandez on the mound, as well as a strong
Australian pitcher, Kelly Hardie, the teams played four scoreless
innings to start the game. Then a fielding error by Australia in
the bottom of the fifth inning broke it open.
</P>
<P>
   A hit by Nuveman bounced past the Australian shortstop, Natalie
Ward, putting her on first base. Leah O'Brien-Amico followed up
with a single, advancing the pinch runner, Jennifer McFalls, to
second base. That brought up Dot Richardson, the team captain, who
stroked a blistering single into center field, bringing home
McFalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to put the ball to the bat,'' said Richardson,
adding that her other major contribution was to shout encouragement
to Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   After striking out the Australian side in the fifth and sixth
innings, Fernandez finally allowed two players to hit her pitches.
But the two final plays summed up the evening for the Australians.
</P>
<P>
   Peta Edebone, the left fielder who did damage in Australia's
last game against the United States, grounded out to third base.
And the right fielder Joanne Brown hit a short hop to Fernandez,
who threw out her out at first base.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez said she did not try to throw strikes at the end of
the game, relying instead on her teammates to make the plays. She
said she felt it was more important to win the game than burnish
her statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fernandez was scorching Monday, the coach of the U.S.
team, Ralph Raymond, deflected a question about his choice of a
starting pitcher on Tuesday. ``I'm thinking of Greg Maddux,'' he
said, referring to the ace of the Atlanta Braves' pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   In facing Japan for a gold medal on Tuesday, the United States
has the chance for a remarkable feat of redemption. Japan is the
third team that defeated the Americans during the disastrous round
robin here, along with China and Australia. The Americans have now
vanquished two of the three.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez said she was particularly distressed about the first
game against Japan because the Americans stranded 22 runners on
base.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is one team we wanted to meet, it is Japan,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez's confidence was shared by her teammates at a news
conference after the game. Richardson, the captain, said the team
held a meeting after its defeat of New Zealand on Friday to retool
its approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a funk, and we needed to change things,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the players said they did not sleep well after the
three defeats. The designated hitter, Michelle Smith, said she
nervously fingered a marble, hoping it would be a talisman for the
team.
</P>
<P>
   The players said they were bolstered by the U.S. women's soccer
team, which turned up in the stands Monday night to cheer
raucously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nightmare,'' said Richardson about last week. ``But
when you have a nightmare, you wake up. And we woke up in time.''

   TEXAS-LAWYERS (Laredo, Texas) _ The way Texas provides legal
representation to its poor is ``a national embarrassment,'''
according to a new report issued by a committee of the Texas State
Bar association. After six years of study, the committee found that
while Texas leads the nation in executions of criminal defendants _

success in wooing Latino voters in his two gubernatorial campaigns.
But Bush has spent little time talking about the widespread poverty
along the border, even as his opponents have tried to make it a

   JANE GOODALL: THE ENVIRONMENT'S MESSENGER OF HOPE
</P>
<P>
   JANE-GOODALL-LIFEBEAT _ Fifteen years ago, Dr. Jane Goodall,
famous for her work with chimpanzees in Tanzania, went to a
scientific conference on conservation. She arrived a field
researcher and left an environmental missionary, galvanized by what
she had learned about pollution, deforestation and the precarious
state of the world. ``Things were much worse than I realized,'' she
recalls. Now 66, she travels relentlessly _ 300 days a year _
delivering a heartfelt message: The time for action is now, each
individual can make a difference and, yes, there is reason for
hope. By Claire Whitcomb. 1,200 words.

   REVERSAL OF FORTUNE: WOMEN AS FAMILY BREADWINNERS
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN-BREADWINNERS-LIFEBEAT _ The first time Betsy Morgan
brought her husband, Chad Gifford, home to meet her family, her
father walked up to Gifford and got right to the point. ``How much
money does an archaeologist make?'' he demanded. It might have been
a reasonable question since Gifford, who had yet to begin graduate
school in archaeology at Columbia University, wasn't even clearing
$15,000 a year _ except for the fact that Morgan herself was on her
way to becoming a network executive at CBS. Thanks to her salary,
the couple, both in their early 30s, live in an apartment just
steps from Manhattan's Central Park and vacation in places like
Italy, Patagonia and Napa Valley. By Lori Leibovich. 1,400 words.

   YOUR THYROID MAY BE TALKING, BUT IS THE DOCTOR LISTENING?
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH-THYROID-DISORDERS-LIFEBEAT _ Some 13 million Americans
suffer from thyroid disorders, most of them women, including
Barbara Bush, Tipper Gore and Olympic track star Gail Devers. But
more than half don't know it. Thyroid disorders, experts say, are
among the most undiagnosed and misdiagnosed problems in the United
States. Doctors generally don't examine the thyroid. Disorders come
on slowly, and the symptoms can be ambiguous. By Donna Wilkinson.

   ARE WE OVERMEDICATING OUR KIDS?
</P>
<P>
   OVERMEDICATING-CHILDREN-LIFEBEAT _ In what many see as a kind of
vast, national experiment, millions of children in the United
States are taking drugs prescribed by doctors to help manage mental
and emotional health problems at ever-younger ages. And the number
of kids on medication is rising. A study by Dr. Julie Magno Zito at
the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy in Baltimore found
that as many as 1.5 percent of American children between the ages
of 2 and 4 are taking stimulants such as Ritalin, as well as
antidepressants and antipsychotics. By Charles W. Schmidt. 1,400

&HT;     TOYOTA JOINS THE 4-DOOR PICKUP FRAY WITH A NEW TACOMA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIG SKY, Mont. _ First came Nissan, then a flood of others this
past year with compact pickups that have four real doors.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Nissan's catchy billboards for the Frontier Crew Cab:
``Four real doors, no real rivals''?
</P>
<P>
   That didn't hold for long, because Dodge introduced the Dakota
Quad Cab, Ford rolled out the Explorer Sport Trac, which
essentially is a four-door Ranger, and both Chevrolet and GMC
announced their new S10 and Sonoma four-doors, and the list kept
growing.
</P>
<P>
   Even Subaru is about to get into the fray with a four-door model
that looks a lot like the Brat pickup the company discontinued in
1987.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a year, these new, roomy four-door models already
have grabbed 10 percent of the compact-pickup market, and industry
analysts predict that they will soon account for one-third of all
sales in this small-truck segment.
</P>
<P>
   Now, playing catch-up _ but poised to grab its fair share of the
market anyway _ comes Toyota with its all-new 2001 Tacoma Double
Cab.
</P>
<P>
   Such four-door models finally give compact-pickup fans a vehicle
that is still manageable in city traffic and other tight spots, but
roomy enough to take the family along without having to cram people
into tiny jump seats behind the front seat.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is to have a real bench seat in the rear, with
full-size rear doors for easy entry and exit, so even adults can
sit in the back comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   On the ski slopes of Big Sky, Mont., in the shadow of
Yellowstone National Park, Toyota recently showed off the Double
Cab to automotive journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that they are a bit late bringing the Double Cab
to market (``We should have done this two years ago,'' one official
said), Toyota executives nonetheless touted the Tacoma's advantages
over the competition, which the company's marketing experts believe
will help make the Double Cab the industry leader.
</P>
<P>
   This truck is not a new concept for Toyota; the company has been
selling the four-door compact Hilux in Europe, Asia and Australia
for 20 years. But that vehicle never was brought to the United
States, primarily because of a 25 percent duty that the U.S.
government charges automakers on imported trucks.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid that import tax, which would make the price too high to
compete against U.S.-made products, Toyota is building the Tacoma
Double Cab at Fremont, Calif., alongside the Corolla sedan and its
Chevrolet counterpart, the Prizm. (Nissan builds the Frontier Crew
Cab in Tennessee, also to avoid the tariff.)
</P>
<P>
   When it begins arriving at Toyota dealerships in October, it
will deliver ``the versatile cargo-hauling capability of a pickup
truck, the passenger roominess and comfort of an SUV and rugged
styling that makes a strong active-lifestyle statement,'' Toyota
says.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected to appeal first to repeat truck buyers who are
looking for more interior room, but also will attract consumers
from among young singles and couples who are involved in outdoor
activities, the company says. And for families, the Double Cab
could be a viable alternative to the minivan or SUV, Toyota says.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the competitors, the Double Cab is the most like the
wildly successful Frontier Crew Cab.
</P>
<P>
   But Toyota believes that it has the edge over the Frontier,
Sport Trac, S10 and Sonoma because the Double Cab has a
five-inch-longer cargo bed, higher ground clearance (11 inches),
class-leading payload capacity of 1,674 pounds, and class-leading
trailer-towing capacity (5,000 pounds).
</P>
<P>
   And that's not to mention the Double Cab's roomier interior,
which includes a 60/40 split fold-down rear bench seat that holds
three adults.
</P>
<P>
   Three versions are offered: A four-cylinder Pre-Runner
two-wheel-drive model that begins at $17,855; a V-6 powered
Pre-Runner that goes for $18,715; and a four-wheel-drive V-6
version that begins at $21,865. (Pre-Runner is the designation for
a special two-wheel-drive model of the Tacoma that is designed to
look like a four-by-four. It now accounts for about half of all
Tacoma two-wheel-drive sales.)
</P>
<P>
   Toyota believes that the Double Cab will quickly account for
one-third of all Tacoma sales.
</P>
<P>
   Engines offered are a 2.7-liter four-cylinder rated at 150
horsepower and 177 foot-pounds of torque, and a 3.4-liter V-6 that
cranks out 190 horsepower and 220 foot-pounds of torque. (The
smaller 2.4-liter, 142-horsepower four-cylinder used in the base
Tacoma is not available in the Double Cab.)
</P>
<P>
   All Tacomas feature a fully-boxed frame and independent front
coil suspension, but the Double Cab has a highly rigid cabin that
has been specially reinforced to support the four doors and offer
less noise, vibration and ride harshness.

&HT;     SEEDS OF FEMINISM SPROUT IN HIGH SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Although Rachel McCully cut school to attend a
National Organization for Women protest rally in San Francisco last
week, she didn't get in trouble with her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the day off, too,'' said Marsha Mak, Rachel's mom and a
counselor at Venture School in San Ramon. ``She wanted to come, and
I thought it was important for her to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Headlined by the national president of NOW, Patricia Ireland,
the protest was part of ``Love Your Body Day,'' and was aimed at
the National Association of Broadcasters convention here.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``stereotypical or sexually exploitative
portrayals of women and girls'' in the entertainment and
advertising media, the protesters criticized the loss of diverse,
minority voices in a radio industry now dominated by a few giant
media conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel, who is 15 and a sophomore at California High School in
San Ramon, said she and her friends began in middle school to
notice all the sick and sexist images of females that permeate
film, television, the fashion industry and much of advertising in
general.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just appalled,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As Ireland put it, such images _ from anorexic, heroin-chic
models to slice-up-the-dumb-blond horror films _ are ``at best,
disrespectful and offensive, and, at worst, unhealthy and
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   With the encouragement of their U.S. history teacher, Tara
Wagner _ who agreed to be their sponsor _ Rachel and her friends
recently founded a feminists club at California High.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to call it `Girls On The Go,' but we realized
that we wanted to educate boys about these issues, too,'' Rachel
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland, who is in the final year of a NOW presidency that began
in December 1991, said such clubs are popping up all over the
country. And mother-daughter teams like Rachel and Marsha are
becoming much more common in women's rights advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's the mother who brings her daughter in, but more
and more, daughters are getting involved first and either bringing
their folks back to feminism or into it for the first time. I just
love that,'' Ireland said.
</P>
<P>
   A former Pan American flight attendant who earned a law degree
at the University of Miami, Ireland acknowledged that the sexual
objectification of women and girls is, in many ways, worse than
when she and millions of young women created the ``Second Feminist
Wave'' in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Shock-jocks, like the nationally syndicated radio talk-show host
Tom Lykis, are now part of the mainstream cultural landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Ever in search of bare female breasts to autograph, Lykis' idea
of humor is to make up fictional names for Women's National
Basketball Association teams. The Virginia Vibrator, Tampa Tampon,
Honolulu Hymen and Montana Menopause are but a few.
</P>
<P>
   He also advises his predominantly male audience on ``how to get
laid.'' Two such tips: Look for the prettiest girl with the lowest
self-esteem, and date victims of sexual abuse because ``they put
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ireland said such attitudes lead to ``a decrease in people's
empathy and an increase in callousness toward the painful
experiences of others. It leads to females being dismissed as a set
of body parts.''
</P>
<P>
   What is called for, she said, is exactly what fueled that
feminist wave three decades ago: Heightened awareness and
consciousness-raising through education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a lot of young women who are frightened by the
word `feminist' or don't want to be thought of as `THE women's
libber' in their school,'' Ireland said. ``But each generation has
to be helped to understand how much things have changed for women,
how fast it happened, and how activism is what made it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after the NOW rally, Rachel McCully and her friend
Moujan Zolsaghari convened the first meeting of California High's
feminist club.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 15 people showed up, three of them boys, which was
really awesome,'' Rachel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different and more complex than what I thought,'' she
said, ``but I am really excited.''

&HT;     DESIGN FLAWS ASIDE, BENZ'S S430 IS A GREAT DRIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The all-new Mercedes-Benz S430 combines both the best and the
worst of German engineering.
</P>
<P>
   For just over $74,000, including options, our test car provided
great driving fun, a smooth and remarkably quiet ride, and a
measure of luxury that most other automakers still can't quite get
right.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the S430 delivered a full dose of frustration
in the form of the most confounded and least-thought-out controls
in the history of automaking.
</P>
<P>
   The new S430 is part of an overall remake of Mercedes'
top-of-the-line sedan series, which also includes the S500 and
S600. Criticized in the past for being too big and bulky, the cars
have been slimmed down to a reasonable new-millennium shape without
significant loss of interior room.
</P>
<P>
   As size went down, performance, it seems, went up a notch or
two, and even though the S430 is the lowest-powered model in the S
class, at 275 horsepower, it ranks among the most-fun-to-drive
sedans I've experienced in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The 4.3-liter engine, which gives the S430 its name, is truly a
smooth and classy powerplant, coupled to an equally smooth,
electronically controlled five-speed automatic transmission. And
the car has rear-wheel drive, of course, the hallmark of a good
premium sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Road handling is crisp and sure, with tight steering, quick
throttle response and a new computerized ``electronic stability
program,'' called ESP, that prevents fishtailing and other loss of
control automatically by applying brakes to specific wheels when
wheel slippage is detected.
</P>
<P>
   The result: for a sedan, this is almost as much of a driver's
car as a BMW or Jaguar, but with the luxury and reliability of a
Mercedes-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   And overall, this is a great car to drive and to ride in.
</P>
<P>
   But Mercedes still needs to take a few more lessons from Lexus
in how to design an ergonomic and intelligent interior,
particularly in the area of the instrument panel.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most flagrant of protagonists is the audio/navigation
system, which takes a degree in confusion engineering to operate.
Spending an hour or two in the lengthy owner's manual really
doesn't help; it apparently was written by the same types who
designed the system.
</P>
<P>
   It comes with a joystick-type control at the bottom of a TV-like
screen, which operates most of the functions of both the stereo and
navigation systems. If you are driving alone in this vehicle and
want to operate either system, you need to pull over at a rest area
and take your time. Trying to negotiate your way through the
controls while driving could result in a serious accident because
it requires your undivided attention (including both of your eyes).
</P>
<P>
   And even though there is a CD slot in the dashboard, you can't
use it to play music; it holds a data disc for the navigation
system's moving map. Our test car overcame that problem by adding a
CD changer in the trunk (a $1,620 option). I'd prefer to have that
up front, where you can deal with CDs without stopping the car and
moving suitcases in the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Safety features abound in this car, which is another of the
perks you get with such a high price tag. There are two front air
bags, and there are side air bags for both front and rear
occupants.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even with the frustrations over the instrument panel,
the S430 is a mighty fine automobile. I suppose that if you can
afford to pay almost as much for your car as many people pay for
their homes, you can live with some quirks in return for having a
Mercedes-Benz in the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Luxury features abound, including dual-zone automatic air
conditioning, full leather upholstery, woodgrain-trimmed door
panels and dash, ``Airmatic'' suspension with adaptive damping,
power four-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock system, alloy wheels,
electric sliding and pop-up sunroof, electrically adjustable
tilt-and-telescopic steering wheel, power windows/mirrors/door
locks with remote locking/unlocking, integrated garage-door opener,
intermittent wipers with rain sensor, automatic headlights,
auto-dimming side mirrors, automatic headlights with twilight
sensor, Bose premium sound system, cruise control, heated 14-way
power front seats, trip computer, electric door and trunk-closing
assist, automatic GPS emergency assist system (like General Motors'
OnStar), speed-dependent power steering, and multipoint
fuel-injection with 100,000-mile platinum-tipped sparkplugs.
</P>
<P>
   Two people sit comfortably in the front bucket seats, and three
adults can sit in the rear, but it is more comfortable with two
back there. Rear-seat legroom is a bit limited, however, when the
front seats are positioned all the way back to accommodate larger
people in front.
</P>
<P>
   The trunk is fairly roomy, at 15.4 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   Base price of the S430, the lowest-priced in the S class, is
$69,700, plus $595 transportation. Our $74,020 total sticker price
included the aforementioned CD changer, as well as a headlight
washing system and xenon headlights for $1,105 and something called
an ``SPC special order'' for $1,000, which wasn't explained.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel economy is better than I expected for a car with this much
power: EPA ratings are 17 miles per gallon in the city and 24 mpg
on the highway. The tank holds 16.2 gallons of gasoline.

   Sydney Olympics coverage continues all day on NBC, CNBC and
MSNBC. Bob Costas hosts NBC's 7 to midnight prime-time block, which
tonight focuses on track and field, diving and team equestrian
events. From 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., MSNBC will feature gold medal
matches in women's soccer and tennis. From 5-7 p.m. CNBC has boxing

   Sydney Olympics coverage continues all day on NBC, CNBC and
MSNBC. Bob Costas hosts NBC's 7 to midnight prime-time block, which
tonight focuses on track and field, diving and semifinal games in
basketball. From 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., MSNBC will feature soccer and
canoeing. From 5-7 p.m. CNBC has boxing and field hockey.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the coverage is tape-delayed from much earlier in the
day, due to the many time zones between Sydney and the American
viewers. NBC will work hard to shape the competition into stories
about heroes; if all you want is results, those are available all
day via other news sources.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Leno will offer a ``Tonight Show'' monologue on NBC that
lasts six minutes at 12:35 a.m. Late-night events that follow on
NBC include basketball and water polo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HIGHLIGHTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother,'' CBS at 8: Our long national nightmare is
finally over. After three long, horrible months of this pointless,
brainless, deathly stupid ``reality'' show, viewers will choose a
$500,000 winner from among the three remaining contestants. After
tonight, we hope, CBS will burn the ``Big Brother'' house to the
ground and salt the earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two Guys and a Girl'' and ``Norm,'' ABC at 8 and 9: The
network is apparently throwing in the towel tonight, airing an hour
each of two of its least popular sitcoms. The hijinks include a mad
scientist plot on ``Two Guys'' and a dachshund put out to stud on
``Norm.'' All reruns, too. Avoid!
</P>
<P>
   ``Sabrina the Teenage Witch,'' WB at 8: She's in college now,
and on a new network, but still casting spells. This episode finds
her having a hard time keeping up with her new lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grosse Pointe,'' WB at 8:30: More backstabbing behind the
scenes of a show that's very much like ``Beverly Hills 90210.''
Darren Star created both shows, and he's having some fun getting
even.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor,'' CBS at 9: The two-hour finale, featuring Susan
Hawk's vicious, vindictive soliloquy at the final tribal council.
And as we all know, fat naked Richard Hatch wins the $1 million.
This attracted an enormous audience for a summer show when it aired
the first time, in August. But the castaways' 15 minutes of fame
run out tonight at 11. Rerun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Popular,'' WB at 9: The class gets assigned to care for
lifelike dolls in order to learn the burdens that parents face.
</P>
<P>
   ''20/20 Friday,'' ABC at 10: Barbara Walters just scored a
reported $12 million a year to sign on again with ABC, and her
duties include hosting this newsmagazine. She better come up with
something good.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FAMILY FARE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Rugrats,'' Nickelodeon at 7:30: Chuckie learns about art.
Repeat.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CABLE CAST &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tall Men,'' AMC at 8: This 1955 cattle-drive drama isn't
mentioned with the classics. But Raoul Walsh directed and the cast
includes Clark Gable, Jane Russell and Robert Ryan, and that's good
enough for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erin Brockovich,'' pay-per-view, various times and channels:
This big-screen hit starred Julia Roberts as the sassy leg woman
(in all senses of the word) for attorney Albert Finney as they take
on corporate polluters. Based on a true story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Madness of King George,'' Bravo at 9: We're not sure about
George, but we know this cast can get pretty wild: Nigel Hawthorne,
Helen Mirren, Ian Holm, Rupert Everett, Rupert Graves and Amanda
Donohoe. From 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex and the City,'' HBO at 9:30: Samantha is hired to plan a
bat mitzvah. First aired Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Better Way to Die,'' HBO at 10: Andre Braugher, Scott Wiper
(who also wrote it) and Lou Diamond Phillips star in a thriller
about a former Chicago cop up against the mob. We're thinking it's
maybe not so thrilling, despite the presence of the
always-interesting Braugher.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LATE NIGHT TALK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Late Show with David Letterman,'' CBS at 11:35: Jada Pinkett
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris Rock Show,'' HBO at midnight: Kevin Johnson, Lil' Kim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher,'' ABC at 12:05 a.m.:
David Brenner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late, Late Show with Craig Kilborn,'' CBS at 12:35: Musical
guest Billie Myers.

Milosevic, in Sunday's elections. If Kostunica's predictions are

obstacle to her winning a seat in the Senate. One of three New
Yorkers has an unfavorable opinion of her. Nationally, four of 10

her out of Congress is a principal reason why the New York Senate

&HT;     WINERIES EXPAND TO DEAL WITH WAVE OF TOURISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JENNY STRASBURG  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SONOMA, Calif. _ The tourism business in Northern California's
Wine Country is as hearty as a prize Cabernet. Record-setting
revenues are fueling an explosion of hotel rooms, tony spas,
tasting rooms and high-priced renovations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to come to the wineries. . . . They want to be
where the wine's made. They want to experience the ambience of the
vineyards, the smells of the barrel room, the fermentation of the
grapes,'' said Bruce Cohn, owner of the B.R. Cohn Winery north of
Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   Hawking bottles of chardonnay and merlot isn't enough any more.
More and more, wineries are toasting their visitors with atmosphere
on top of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Northern California drives this wine tourism train, owning more
than half of the state's wineries, according to the wine industry
analysis firm Motto, Kryla and Fisher and the San Francisco-based
Wine Institute, a nonprofit research and lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   Wine benefits California's tourism more than in any other state,
said Fred Sater, spokesman for the state Division of Tourism.
``There's a greater marriage of food and wine now. I think that's
part of the travel experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of California wines domestically and abroad reached a
record 446 million gallons in 1999, enough to fill about 30,000
backyard swimming pools, according to the Wine Institute and
California Association of Winegrape Growers.
</P>
<P>
   The state's sales volume has increased for six consecutive
years, according to the study, which also reflects a rise in
Americans' thirst for premium wines, the fastest-growing segment of
California's estimated $13 billion annual domestic sales revenue.
</P>
<P>
   And premium is Northern California's strength, both in the
bottle and in the image.
</P>
<P>
   With cellar doors swung open wide and wine glasses extended,
winery operators both large and small are establishing ornate gift
shops and grooming lush lawns and courtyards for weddings, parties,
summertime concerts and corporate meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Well through harvest, which is expected to last until middle or
late October, wineries also are enticing visitors with expanded
tours that venture into areas once off-limits: cool underground
cellars and clattering bottling rooms, the working bowels of a
winery.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn, a grape grower since 1974 with a parallel life as manager
of the Doobie Brothers rock band, recalls a time when the typical
Sonoma County tasting room was a barrel of wine with the winemaker
at the spout, pouring a glass for the occasional visitor.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, the visitors became not so occasional.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing gangbusters out of our tasting room,'' said Cohn,
who is about to spend $1 million on a new one. That follows a
$600,000 project to build a new parking lot, add landscaping and
make road improvements for the winery's rising visitor traffic.
</P>
<P>
   B.R. Cohn opened in 1984, hosting visitors by appointment only.
Those days are history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably a third of our sales are out of the tasting room,''
Cohn said. That has changed drastically since the 1980s, he said,
when the tasting room accounted for about 10 percent of his sales.
</P>
<P>
   Valley of the Moon, in Glen Ellen, has a massive new production
and bottling facility and an expanded tasting room and gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, 90 percent or more of a winery's sales came from
wine, said Robert Frost, the tasting room manager. Now, merchandise
accounts for probably $3 out of $10 earned at most wineries.
</P>
<P>
   Another Sonoma County label _ small, family-owned Wellington _
just invested $250,000 in new barrel and fermentation rooms on top
of a recent $100,000 tasting room overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Some 600 to 1,000 visitors drop by the tasting room every month,
said Peter Wellington, winemaker for the company he owns with his
father, John Wellington.
</P>
<P>
   Because they run such a small operation _ producing just 6,000
cases a year _ Wellington's distribution budget is limited, and
visitors buy about half of what the winery sells each year in
retail, Peter Wellington said.
</P>
<P>
   But his investment is small compared to what larger players are
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Industry giant Sebastiani is spending at least $10 million to
renovate its original 1913 stone cellar and expand its tasting room
and gift shop in Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   In Napa County, the venerable Robert Mondavi Winery, crown jewel
of the $380 million-a-year Mondavi empire, is spending $30 million
to renovate and expand its signature mission-style winery in
Oakville.
</P>
<P>
   Mondavi also has taken a leadership role in establishing the
nonprofit American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, a $50
million culinary and cultural center _ $20 million from Mondavi _
scheduled to open in next fall in downtown Napa, along the Napa
River.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Mondavi's winery visitors spent $15 to $20 a
head. Now they're parting with $40, said Joyce Stavert, director of
visitor programs.
</P>
<P>
   In an increasingly competitive marketplace, wineries are
pressured to create lasting impressions.
</P>
<P>
   They want tourists to go home and pick out Northern California
labels from the dizzying array of brands flooding restaurant menus
and supermarket shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always thought we have a couple of products here,''
Sonoma winery veteran Tom Scott said. ``We've got the wine. And
we've got the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott is hospitality director for the Gloria Ferrer Champagne
Caves, makers of sparkling wine in the Carneros region.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years alone, Gloria Ferrer has spent more than
$2 million on new caves, new refrigeration and fermenting tanks,
and other improvements to its buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like going underground. It's kind of the romance of the
business _ seeing the barrels, smelling the smells,'' said Bob
Iantosca, winemaker and vice president. ``And we get an opportunity
for half an hour to explain what we do and why we do it.''

   Students of Martha Stewart know that there is something about
Halloween that seems to spur her to dizzying heights of creativity.
That's Martha on the cover of her special Holiday issue on
Halloween, looking particularly witchy _ and unrecognizable _ in
fright makeup. The caption reads, ``Martha Gets Ghoulish.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine is a Halloween primer, full of ideas for making the
most of the day. Maybe I'm getting soft in the head, or just soft
on Martha, (which may amount to the same thing) but some of the
suggestions _ OK, a few of the suggestions _ seemed relatively
simple, emphasis on ``relatively.'' I like the flower
``derangement'' with shrunken heads made of apples. And the gnarly
pretzel lady fingers are cute. The garbage bag witch costume seems
feasible, although I'm not so sure about the fairy godmother get-up
made of paper coffee filters.
</P>
<P>
   It's all a long way from Halloween chez White, traditionally
observed with a bucketful of little Snickers bars to keep the kids
from soaping the windows. But Martha's Halloween issue has a
surprisingly light touch, most of it anyway, although not a piece
titled ``Pumpkin Carving 101,'' an illustrated guide to a small
arsenal of essential pumpkin-carving tools _ saws, drills, melon
ballers, gouges, linoleum cutters, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Martha has a special and serious relationship with pumpkins. The
subject is doubtless ripe for a doctoral dissertation (``A
Vegetable Passion: Pumpkins and the Aesthetic of Perfection in the
Work of Martha Stewart''). I can't help but wonder if pumpkins
might have some personal, symbolic Cinderella association for
Martha. But maybe I'm getting carried away.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, she's transformed pumpkins into soup bowls
and tureens, used them as cooking vessels, vases, doorstops, garden
lights, night lights, picture frames. Who could forget her
jack-o-lantern snake, made of 34 carved and illuminated pumpkins in
graduated sizes? I never thought she'd top that, but now she has.
</P>
<P>
   This year's pumpkin piece de resistance isn't in the special
Halloween Holiday number, but in the October issue of Martha
Stewart Living, the one with the pumpkin chandelier on the cover:
``Casually adorned with colorful fallen leaves, a simple grapevine
wreath is illuminated by tea lights set inside mini-pumpkins.
Suspended from a ceiling hook, it gives a warm, rustic atmosphere
to a front porch.'' (Warm indeed. With all those leaves and candles
it looks like a conflagration waiting to happen.)
</P>
<P>
   Inside the magazine, on page 226, is the item in question, an
astonishing creation, a ``Tiffany style'' pumpkin chandelier, two
elaborately carved pumpkins, suspended on wires. According to the
accompanying text, ``though the fixtures look intricate, they are
easy to re-create with the proper tools and a bit of patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy for whom? I wonder. Perhaps for those who send for Martha's
Ultimate Pumpkin Carving Kit, only $75 from the Martha By Mail
catalog. She didn't make Forbes' list of leading billionaires by
selling ideas alone.
</P>
<P>
   I've long suspected that Martha may be putting us on with some
of these elaborate projects. Is she lying awake at night in her
fabulous new Manhattan digs, counting her millions and chuckling at
the idea of her fans trying to turn pumpkins into Tiffany lamps? I
wouldn't be surprised.

   Up in the thin air of the Andes, amid the ruins of Machu Picchu
_ summer palace to the Incas around the year 1500 _ a bunch of
hotshot 21st century ad guys were working hard to sell beer.
</P>
<P>
   Too hard. Way too hard. So hard that a 1,000-pound crane
carrying their camera equipment fell and banged into the rocks two
weeks ago, chipping off the corner of an obelisk that the Incas had
used as a sundial.
</P>
<P>
   No beer could be that good. No product image could be that
compelling. But ad guys on a creative tear transcend logic and
often think they can defy gravity. Swinging from helicpoters,
dropping over canyon ledges, hauling The Product to the top of the
world, they go for the killer shot.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes people die. Not in Machu Picchu, luckily. The J.
Walter Thompson Co. shoot for Cusquena beer merely assaulted
antiquity, appalling archeologists around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Alex Traugott told Reuters that the advertising agency
``deeply regretted'' the damage, noting that it had been caused by
``mechanical failure.'' He said the company had been shooting beer
commercials in the area for 12 years, had been careful, and had
government approval for the filming.
</P>
<P>
   But an official at the National Institute of Culture told
reporters that the crew had sneaked the crane onto the site at
dawn, after having been warned not to use heavy equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the air is very thin at 7,782 feet and can affect the
brain, and, quite possibly, the ego. So can the pace and demands of
advertising production.
</P>
<P>
   ``You push to the limit to get a shot,'' says Pete Favat,
creative director at Arnold Communications in Boston. ``That's what
the film business is. For clients who like things big you have to
go the extra mile. You push to make it bigger and better and
faster.''
</P>
<P>
   That means being there on the cliff, in the plane, in front of a
stampeding herd, or smack up against a 500-year-old monument.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, a computer-generated shot could be done a lot more safely,
but Favat says virtual images often lack the drama of the real
thing, as well as being more expensive and time-consuming to
produce.
</P>
<P>
   But reality can cost a lot more than time and money.
</P>
<P>
   Favat recently lost three friends who died shooting a Nissan
commercial for a California agency. Their helicopter crashed in the
glaciers of British Columbia after a rotor blade clipped the side
of a cliff as they went for that perfect angle on a sport utility
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Favat recalls an ad he did for an investment company that had a
man talking on a cell phone while standing on the eagle at the top
of the Chrysler Building. The actor had a safety line tied around
his leg and didn't look down. But an inch here or there and he
could have collected his last residual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time somebody does a spot that's dramatic, it ups the
ante,'' says Mike Sheehan, president and chief creative officer of
Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos Inc. ``This is basic human
nature. People see something once and it's dramatic. Then it
becomes mundane. The bar keeps rising.''
</P>
<P>
   So, let's lower it already! Bring it back down to the
common-sense range, which, given the sensory overload on
television, might have more impact than another Madison Avenue
circus act.
</P>
<P>
   Comes the umpteenth commercial featuring extreme sports, or
crashing waves, or the truck conquering a rock tower, and the eyes
glaze over.
</P>
<P>
   Comes yet another parade of special effects, and the brain fogs
up, unsure of what it's seeing, or why. That ad featuring cowboys
herding cats, for instance, is hilariously entertaining with its
tabbies thundering across the sage. But does anyone remember the
product? Cat food? Yarn balls? Stetsons?
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing makes a person nostalgic for the Veg-a-Matic
guy. Always knew what he was selling. Makes a person crave
Alka-Seltzer _ especially the ad with the man talking to his
stomach, and the one with the ``speecy spicey meatball.''
</P>
<P>
   Bring back Dinah Shore seeing the USA in her Chevrolet. Bring
back Mr. Clean. Bring back ``prunes _ the funny fruit,'' and
anything else Stan Freberg wants to do.
</P>
<P>
   Low budget, low to the ground, and nobody gets hurt, unless the
Veg-a-Matic guy loses it. Less is more. Small is big. And in the
immortal words of our mothers: (itals)Just because everyone else
jumps off the Brooklyn Bridge, doesn't mean you have to do it
too.(unitals)

FIRESTONE CASE FORCES RETHINKING OF REGULATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The yeastiest debate in American civic life this
fall hasn't been prompted by the presidential election. It was
triggered by the Bridgestone/Firestone tire recall.
</P>
<P>
   For years, politicians, business executives, and even some
consumers have railed against Big Government, protesting the
dictatorial impulses of nosy federal regulators who want to decide
how much water there should be in your toilet tank or how many
airbags there should be in your car.
</P>
<P>
   Now many of those same protesters are complaining that federal
regulators didn't act swiftly enough, or decisively enough, when
evidence came forward suggesting that defective
Bridgestone/Firestone tires were linked to what appears, at last
tally, to be 101 deaths, more than 400 injuries, and 2,226 consumer
inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, for the second time in two decades, Washington is
embroiled in a debate over the role and reach of regulation. And
this time many of the foes of federal regulation are in retreat _
or, more precisely, are in the process of conversion.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Alabama Republican Senator Richard Shelby last week
dropped his longstanding opposition to a plan to publicly rate
vehicles according to their rollover risk. For more than 20 years,
the auto industry has blocked such ratings, most recently with the
help of Shelby, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations
Committee's subcommittee on transportation. But that changed on
Wednesday, when his office announced a deal allowing the ratings
plan to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the new climate in Washington in the wake of the
Bridgestone/Firestone revelations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't a detailed statistical analysis but hot spots _
dramatic examples of shortcomings in the public sector, and the
Firestone case is a classic example _ that generate public interest
in regulation,'' said Murray L. Wiedenbaum, who was chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisors during the presidency of Ronald
Reagan, one of the most powerful voices of antigovernment sentiment
in the last century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government is not an unemotional process. These cases stir the
public,'' Wiedenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   They also stir the politicians, as last week's congressional
hearings on Bridgestone/Firestone made clear.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in recent weeks Capitol Hill has been flooded by
proposals to increase regulation of the auto and tire industries,
to provide for more reporting of safety defects, to toughen safety
standards, to bolster the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, or NHTSA, and even to impose criminal penalties for
corporate officers who fail to comply with regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people who opposed regulation are watching which way
the parade is going and are trying to get in front of it,'' said
Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the
Judiciary Committee, which will take up some of the legislation
growing out of the Bridgestone/Firestone tire problems.
</P>
<P>
   The rush to the legislative hopper has been a bipartisan
scramble. ``We need to know why NHTSA was asleep at the switch when
information was served up to them on a silver platter,''
Representative Fred Upton, the Michigan Republican who heads the
investigative subcommittee of the House Commerce Committee, said at
hearings earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors of some of this legislation are among the strangest
bedfellows in Washington. One of the House bills, in fact, is
sponsored by Upton and Representative W. J. Tauzin of Louisiana,
Republicans with perennially high ratings from the US Chamber of
Commerce _ along with Representatives Henry J. Waxman of California
and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, Democrats who customarily
are more supportive of federal intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans have tried to put every one of these agencies
_ NHTSA, the Consumer Products Safety Commission, others _ on a
starvation diet for every one of the six years they have controlled
Congress,'' said Markey. ``Now the consequences are clear, and
there is no zeal to match the zeal of these Republican converts to
regulation. It's not so much that the Republicans have seen the
light. They are feeling the heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sue Bailey, the new administrator at NHTSA, is asking
Congress to give her agency more authority to investigate safety
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers, economists, and business executives agree that
regulation is a formidable force in the American economy. One
study, conducted in 1997 by Robert W. Hahn and Robert E. Litan for
the American Enterprise Institute and the Brookings Institution,
put the cost of protecting health, safety, and the environment at
more than $200 billion a year. A 1999 study by the Environmental
Protection Agency found that the value of the public-health and
environmental benefits growing out of the Clean Air Act amendments
of 1990 ``exceed their costs by a margin of four to one.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Americans want assurances of safety but are skeptical
of regulation. Leahy likes to tell the story of the truck driver
whose bumper sticker says ``Get Government Off My Back,'' but who
wants assurances that the bridges he drives over are safe. ``We
want safety in cars, food, the air, the water, and in factories,''
he said. ``We don't want regulation for the sake of regulation, but
there is a price to pay for the inspectors and regulators that can
assure safety.''
</P>
<P>
   That apparent contradiction helps explain why Republicans, who
often oppose regulation, have often been principals in the struggle
for regulation and why Democrats, who often speak up for government
programs, have often tried to scale back the size and scope of
government.
</P>
<P>
   The strong federal role in environmental regulation, for
example, was established under President Nixon and the 1990 Clean
Air Act standards were established under President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of regulation has not been that partisan a
phenomenon,'' said Wiedenbaum, who now heads the Center for the
Study of American Business at Washington University in St. Louis.
``It is driven by consumers, but also by the press. Highly
publicized examples really motivate the public, and the Firestone
example is out of the classic mold.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that public impatience with corporations is coming
at a time when business forces are driving a strong economy. But
the Bridgestone/Firestone episode has underlined the safety stakes
for individuals in the regulation debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an era when government regulation is out of vogue,''
said Gene Kimmelman, Washington co-director of the Consumers Union.
``But a big crisis in the marketplace has reminded people that
without that regulation, profit-maximizing companies don't have an
adequate incentive to respond to safety problems swiftly.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now a lot of political figures who ordinarily consider
themselves skeptical of regulation find themselves agreeing. Since
Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. recalled 6.5 million of its ATX and
Wilderness tires, consumers have rushed to auto dealers, tire
outlets, and garages to exchange tires affected by the action, and
to seek reassurance about other tires not covered by the recall. It
is an example of the public voting not with its feet but with its
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want regulation for a lot of reasons, but every
economist believes there are places where the market fails,'' said
Paul R. Portney, president of Resources for the Future, a
Washington-based environmental group. ``There are areas, like the
environment and occupational safety, where people want regulation _
not to override the market but to do things that will make the
market work better.''

IF THEY ONLY KNEW SUNUNU'S POSITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. -- If they only knew:
</P>
<P>
   About John E. Sununu.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, he is against abortion rights _ all of them. I
would be tempted to say he is passionately against all abortion
rights, but the incumbent pol from New Hampshire's first
congressional district cannot be said to be passionate about
anything.
</P>
<P>
   He's a fly-under-the-radar congressman, a go-along-to-get-along
two-termer now looking for the win that could make him congressman
for life.
</P>
<P>
   But he is against abortion rights, or the right of a woman to
choose free of government pregnancy regulation. In fact, the public
record is bereft of anything other than his opposition _ to Roe v
Wade as we know it, to support of the family planning programs that
make the trauma of abortion unnecessary, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Fuller Clark, the state legislative leader from
Portsmouth who is opposing him this time, is for the right to
choose. In fact, she was the one who pushed the legislation that
finally repealed the 1848 law (illegal under Roe) that outlawed
abortion services in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Ten bucks says hardly anyone in Sununu's district knows this.
That, of course, is one purpose of political campaigns, but that
(also of course) is why Sununu is especially desirous of flying
under the radar this year. He is a conservative Congressman from a
district that trends independent and moderate _ and his stand
against abortion rights is but the tip of a rather large iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   When Clark, the assistant Democratic leader in the Legislature,
was setting up her campaign, her so-called foundation poll
disclosed an interesting set of results _ common to congressional
districts that are not on national radar screens as
``competitive.'' The survey (by Democratic guru Celinda Lake)
showed that as a simple, reelect the incumbent proposition, Sununu
can win in a cakewalk; but as voters learn of the Sununu and Clark
positions on the more important issues of the day the landscape
changes dramatically. In fact, the race becomes competitive _ in
the single-digit category where anything can happen down a
month-long stretch.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the survey was taken while George W. Bush was
enjoying his preconvention, solid margin over Al Gore, which has
since disappeared, largely via the raising of the same issues
Martha Fuller Clark is pressing.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, nearly all the early national and local
attention has gone to the so-called upcountry district race
featuring Democrat Barney Brannen against incumbent Charley Bass.
Ten bucks also says that will change, as witness Clark's appearance
last month in search of an endorsement from the AFL-CIO, then
assumed to be concentrating on Brannen-Bass; she emerged with
labor's full backing.
</P>
<P>
   Issues drove that decision, along with her politely feisty
demeanor. As she put it during a rally for Gore here recently,
``John Sununu may have a well-known name but his record is not so
well known.''
</P>
<P>
   On the most-mentioned topic in congressional and Senate
elections around the country thus far, prescription drug insurance
coverage for the elderly, John Sununu is if anything to Bush's
right. That means market solutions of the kind that have left a
solid third of New Hampshire's 150,000 Medicare beneficiaries
without drug coverage of any kind. Where the issue is offering
coverage within Medicare, he has voted ``no'' and Clark says yes.
</P>
<P>
   On education, Sununu's status as a budget and appropriations
committee member inching his way up the ladder is meaningless. As a
conservative from a state where government is looked on from the
right as the enemy, New Hampshire ranks 49th in federal funds from
Washington, a key element in its public school problems. With
Clark, voters will get support for aid in building and repairing
schools, hiring more teachers, securing more general assistance, a
lot more. With Sununu, they get ``no'' votes.
</P>
<P>
   But another 10 bucks says voters in his district don't know
Sununu has opposed increasing the puny minimum wage of $5.15 by a
dollar _ at a time when congressional pay has increased for him by
$8,000, which Clark's campaign likes to point is one year's
minimum-wage income.
</P>
<P>
   Clark came to the Legislature 10 years ago from a life of local
activism (she is a preservation movement hero along the Seacoast).
She was Governor Jeanne Shaheen's designee to pass the state's
patient's bill of rights regulating HMOs (Sununu voted against the
more sweeping federal version), and she has battled to require
insurance coverage of women's contraceptive prescriptions (Sununu
opposed a similar federal requirement).
</P>
<P>
   In the horse race, she battles a shrewd phantom. You can respect
conservatives who fight to advance their cause.
</P>
<P>
   But John Sununu (unlike his infamous father) is hiding behind
his incumbency and his name. If the voters find out what he's been
doing, he deserves the trouble he'll be in.

PIANIST BERET UNPARALLELED IN PLAYING, RECORDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an era when even Evgeny Kissin can no longer write his own
ticket, the Turkish pianist Idil Biret has completed three major
projects. For the budget label Naxos, she has recorded about 40 CDs
over the last decade, including boxed sets of the complete piano
music of Brahms and Chopin that will soon be joined by a 10-CD set
of Rachmaninoff.
</P>
<P>
   Biret was a pupil and protegee of three of the greatest
musicians of the last century, Wilhelm Kempff, Alfred Cortot, and
Nadia Boulanger, and her legacy of recordings is worthy of her
heritage. She ranges more widely than most contemporary pianists,
and her recordings also include the complete piano sonatas of
Pierre Boulez; Liszt's transcriptions of the Beethoven symphonies
and Berlioz's ``Symphonie fantastique''; two Saint-Saens piano
concertos; and an album of music about childhood by Schumann,
Debussy, and Tchaikovsky. Brahms biographer and recording expert
Bernard Jacobson believes her 12-CD Brahms set is the finest
complete version ever recorded; her complete Rachmaninoff is also
unsurpassed for aristocratic, passionate pianism and exacting
musicianship.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-CD Chopin set puts her up against some heavy competition
_ no single pianist can hope to compete against the historical
record in each and every piece. Still, at her best, as in the
``Barcarolle,'' Biret is sublime, and the set won a Polish Grand
Prix duDisque in 1995 and an encomium from Mahler's great
biographer Henry-Louis de la Grange, who praises Biret for her
``authority, epic sense, rigor, power, emotion, poetry . . . and
daring.''
</P>
<P>
   When I was a struggling piano student in Paris in 1961-1962,
Biret was a brightly blazing star, already generating the kind of
excitement that would surround her contemporary Martha Argerich
after the Chopin Competition in 1965. I still have a vivid memory
of the tiny Biret, dressed in blue, tearing into Bartok's Second
Piano Concerto with a ferocity and accuracy I had never seen
paralleled.
</P>
<P>
   Today when Biret is not on the road playing concerts, about 45
of them a year, she divides her time among Istanbul, Paris, and
Brussels. Reached in Brussels recently, she recalled her American
debut in 1963, when she played Rachmaninoff's Third Concerto with
the Boston Symphony Orchestra the afternoon of the Kennedy
assassination. Erich Leinsdorf was the conductor.
</P>
<P>
   ``My birthday is the 21st of November, so the orchestra played
`Happy Birthday' to me at the rehearsal and everything was going
perfectly. The afternoon of the concert I felt something was
unusual, but I didn't know what it was. Mr. Leinsdorf, looking very
pale, came into my room and said, `Ah, there you are,' and then
walked out. His secretary came in and sat down, but she was in a
very strange state, but she didn't say anything either. Then my
father came in and told me that President Kennedy had been shot and
that there was some question about whether we would continue with
the concert or not. But Mr. Cabot, the chairman of the board, went
out onto the stage and said that the day he lost his father he
attended a concert and found consolation in it, and hoped the
audience would find solace in this music. Everyone was in a
terrible state, but we played the concerto anyway; it was a very
tragic debut.''
</P>
<P>
   The BSO added the funeral march from Beethoven's ``Eroica''
Symphony to the program. Margo Miller, writing in the Globe,
praised the 23-year-old pianist for her depth of touch, dynamics,
lyricism, and ``rapture of youth,'' and a cassette of the event
confirms the review. Despite the circumstances and Leinsdorf's
precipitous tempi, Biret's pianistic equilibrium is never
disturbed, and her emotional fires blaze away, unbanked.
</P>
<P>
   Like Argerich, Biret was a prodigious child musician. Born in
Ankara, Biret had toddled over to the piano by the time she ws 3.
Before she was able to read music, she was playing preludes and
fugues from Bach's ``Well-Tempered Clavier'' by ear _ and, before
long, in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family is musical; my mother played the piano and so did my
grandmother, who also composed, and there was a lot of chamber
music at home. The Turkish National Assembly passed a law to enable
me to study in Paris. My teacher had been a student of Nadia
Boulanger and thought that would be the best for me,'' she said.
``So I went to Paris when I was 7, with my parents, and enrolled at
the Conservatoire, where I studied piano with Jean Doyen and
counterpoint, harmony, fugue, and all those things with Mlle.
Boulanger. The hard class was her keyboard class, where you had to
play from sight from orchestral scores and make basso continuo and
transpose and sight-read at the same time. It was not always so
very easy.''
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, at 7, she also met Cortot and Kempff, who kept an eye
on her progress; she played regularly for the German pianist, but
he didn't want to interfere with her preparatory studies, telling
her he would work with her after she had graduated.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 11, Kempff asked me to play the Mozart Concerto for
Two Pianos with him, which to me seemed quite normal _ I had no
idea what something like that meant. Later I worked with him
extensively; every morning we would play for two or three hours,
and then in the afternoon another two. It was a very full day! He
was not the same kind of teacher that Boulanger was _ she would
spend an hour on two bars, and he would sometimes say, `Let's just
go for a walk.' Kempff hated hard, harsh sounds, and his way of
using the pedal was unique and refined. I remember once I played
Beethoven's `Hammerklavier' for him, and he said, `It's too
bombastic _ always be careful to leave something more, to give the
feeling that you can go more.' And he was very careful about style.
The forte of Chopin is not the forte of Liszt or Brahms. With
Brahms, he didn't like the traditional heavy-handed approach at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Biret's most gorgeous records is a tribute to Kempff, a
collection of his transcriptions from Bach, Gluck, and Mozart,
together with two of his own compositions. Biret remained close to
Kempff until his death in 1991 and in that year, just before his
96th and final birthday, she played this program in his honor _ and
in his presence.
</P>
<P>
   With Cortot, Biret had a lesson every month for two years. ``He
was an incredible personality, so elegant in his way of dressing,
speaking, and behaving. He was quite old, but he would sit at the
piano and play, and the sound that emerged was absolutely
incredible. And of course he knew everything; no matter what I was
playing, he could show me examples. He had the big dimension, the
breadth to play all those different things. And he had what
Rachmaninoff called the most important thing, to know where the
crucial point in every piece is. What both Kempff and Cortot had
was this wonderful breathing through a deep legato. I am still
working to achieve that _ practicing always without pedal, and then
the pedal must come in like the `third hand,' giving a certain
sound that is magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Chopin, Brahms, and Rachmaninoff are beloved romantic
composers, each was at heart a classicist in discipline and even in
mastery of counterpoint. Rachmaninoff has always been a popular
favorite, but only recently has his music begun to acquire a
reputation for compositional quality as well as for vulgar effects
and overripe tunes. ``My teacher Nadia Boulanger was absolutely
against Rachmaninoff's music, and when I was asked to play the
Third Concerto, this was for her the worst catastrophe that could
possibly happen. She once saw Rachmaninoff on a train platform and
told me she was tempted to say to him, `When you look and behave
and play in such a wonderful way, how can you write such a terrible
music?' But I find a great nobility in his music, and when I worked
with her on his `Corelli Variations,' she started changing her
opinion completely. And I think there was a personal reason for the
antipathy _ once in Russia in 1914, she was playing two-piano
concerts with Raoul Pugno, who was ill; he asked Rachmaninoff to
replace him, but Rachmaninoff refused because he was afraid of
contagion. Pugno went ahead and played, and then he died. She never
forgave Rachmaninoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Biret says she has learned a great deal from recording the
complete works of these three composers. ``In the smaller or
unfamiliar pieces you find certain ingredients that you find in the
great famous ones. It is interesting to see that certain musical
preoccupations are going on throughout a composer's lifetime; and
the whole process is very interesting psychologically. And none of
them wrote an uninteresting piece; there is always some
substance.''
</P>
<P>
   She is fascinated by the connections among pieces, and not just
the piano pieces. She appears to know the complete works of every
composer, and recently has been analyzing Brahms's First Concerto,
a work she has played for decades _ she believes it is a response
to Schumann's ``Introduction and Allegro.'' ``It is like a puzzle,
and every piece fits perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   Biret has no shortage of future projects. She plans to record
the complete Beethoven Sonatas _ but not for Naxos _ and
``something contemporary, but I am not yet permitted to say what it
is.'' She also admits a longing to record more Faure. ``That music
I like very much, although it is not often well-played; we are so
far from that time and style. You have to study not only music, but
to know the literature of the time and the history and the kind of
life the composer had, what everything in the period was like _ all
this you need to do to play the piano.''

TWEETY FINALLY GETS A CHANCE TO REALLY FLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``Tweety's High Flying Adventure'' _ It's too bad
Warner Bros. waited so long to give Tweety, the mischievously cute
yellow bird, her first feature. And it's direct-to-video. Oh, the
humiliation Tweety must feel when strolling through Termite
Terrace, the nickname for the legendary WB animation unit. While
the animation quality can't compare with the vintage WB cartoons,
it does include a fine supporting cast including Tweety's nemesis,
Sylvester, and Daffy, Bugs, and Pepe. Not released in DVD.
</P>
<P>
   NEW TO DVD: ``Men in Black: Limited Edition'' _ How many ways
can a movie be marketed, remarketed, and re-remarketed? In the case
of this Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones comedy from the summer of
1997, three ways. First VHS, then DVD, and, now, a bigger and
better DVD. One of the great features is the addition of an editing
component overseen by director Barry Sonnenfeld. They've concocted
a way to reedit a sequence using outtakes from the original
production. It's a lot of fun: Viewers can compare their work with
Sonnenfeld's, and it's all done using the remote control. This
``Limited Edition'' is also valuable as an educational tool for
film students who can see how certain bizarre characters morphed
from sketches on a page into more fully realized characters and
creatures on the screen. The ``Limited Edition'' for $40 contains
all of the extras. The $30 edition does not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bank Dick'' (1940) _ Criterion does it again. W. C.
Fields's masterful performance as Egbert Souse is clearer than it
has been in years. Those accustomed to scratchy prints and muffled
sound in previous tapes will be amazed at the crisp quality of this
landmark comedy. Apparently, the behind-the-scenes squabbling on
this film was legendary. All the principals are dead, but you can
almost hear Fields complaining about kids and washing it down with
a bottle of vodka. Nobody said he was nice _ just funny.
</P>

HIROHITO, THE HUNGRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan 
By Herbert P. Bix 
HarperCollins, 784 pp., illustrated, $35 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before, during, and immediately after World War II, Americans
saw the Japanese as the Yellow Peril personified _ aggressive,
deceitful, barbaric militarists, opportunists of the worst sort.
When our friends the British and French were occupied with the evil
Nazis in Europe, the evil Japs fell on their rear, consuming their
Asian colonies.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s and 1960s, an alternative view emerged,
particularly among people worried about the morals and motives of
America's own militarist-industrialist complex.
</P>
<P>
   In this view, Japan's drive to modernize, militarize, and
expand, which began in the late 19th century and led to the Pacific
War, was a pragmatic reaction to what the Japanese saw Britain,
France, the United States and others doing to China and South Asia.
The Japanese feared that they, like the Chinese and Vietnamese,
would be subjected to racial, cultural, and economic domination,
unless they were able to prevent it militarily.
</P>
<P>
   One constant in these otherwise sharply divergent analyses was
Hirohito, the emperor in whose name the Japanese fought. Both views
portrayed the occupant of the Chrysanthemum Throne as weak, a pawn
in the hands of military men who manipulated and controlled him as
completely as centuries of shoguns had controlled his ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Disproving this view of the emperor is the primary aim of
Herbert P. Bix's overly long but smoothly written ``Hirohito and
the Rise of Modern Japan,'' which portrays the emperor as a ruler
who held great power and was hungry for much more.
</P>
<P>
   The Showa emperor may not have been a Hitler, in Bix's view, but
he aided and approved _ however perfunctorily _ a hysteria of
cultural and national superiority responsible for tens of millions
of deaths. At the least, in Bix's indictment, he was somewhat worse
than a Kaiser Wilhelm.
</P>
<P>
   Determining the degree of Hirohito's war responsibility has
become, quite literally, a holy grail for scholars and historians
of Japan's role in World War II. If achieved, it could lead to deep
self-examination by the Japanese of the death and destruction they
wreaked on a broad swath of Asia, and, in turn, to the healing of
still-festering resentments toward Japan harbored by innumerable
Chinese, Koreans, and others.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bix draws on new materials, available only since
Hirohito's death in 1989, and has mastered a broader array of
Japanese-language sources than most earlier Western authors, the
indictment ultimately is unconvincing.
</P>
<P>
   There is too much rhetoric and little hard evidence that the
emperor was actually in control, too many instances in which the
militarists did what they wanted and presented Hirohito with a fait
accompli, too many scenes in which the emperor comes across as a
fundamentally weak individual.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Bix succeeds on other, important levels,
particularly in demonstrating that the emperor shirked moral
responsibilities that any decent person, and certainly anyone
charged with the national consciousness of 100 million human
beings, ought to feel. There can be little doubt, given the
evidence presented here, that he could have curbed the worst abuses
committed by Japan's militarists, if only he had tried.
</P>
<P>
   Bix also offers fresh and well-documented insights into Japan's
war in China in the years leading up to the World War.
</P>
<P>
   The general view has long been that, whatever Japan's motives
for colonizing north China and ravaging much of the rest, the
invasion was a mistake in that it bogged down, occupying huge
numbers of troops that could otherwise have been fighting the
Americans and British. Bix convincingly demonstrates that Japanese
colonialism, like British, French, and Dutch colonialism before it,
was lucrative and militarily invigorating.
</P>
<P>
   It has long been known that the United States decided not to put
Hirohito on trial for war crimes for strategic and political
reasons. Morals and justice had nothing to do with it. Communist
movements were sweeping China and Eastern Europe at the time. Cold
War with the Soviet Union had begun. Given the times, laying great
responsibility on the emperor could have led to the fall of the
monarchy as well as the monarch, removing from the political stage
the primary symbol of Japan's continuity, stability, and
hierarchical tradition. It was far more important to American
interests that Japan be a stable bulwark against communism.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy served the United States well, but the cost to
Japan was high. As Bix aptly puts it, ``Many Japanese . . . had
been complicit with (Hirohito) in waging war, and the nation as a
whole came to feel that because the emperor had not been held
responsible, neither should they.''
</P>
<P>
   The ramifications extend beyond Japan's still unsettled
relations with its neighbors to the value of Japanese-style
consensus decision-making, which came in for lavish praise during
the Japanese economic miracle of the 1960s through 1980s, and still
is credited with making Japan a more civil place than most of the
rest of the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   For time and again Bix shows political and military leaders
before and during the war papering over their differences without
resolving them, presenting a show of unity behind a serene, supreme
leader, when unity, serenity, and supremacy all were mere facades.
It is not difficult to infer that true examination of the hows and
whys of the war might have produced a profoundly different postwar
society.
</P>
<P>
   If you are going to read just one serious book about modern
Japan, this is not it. Too little attention is given to putting
Japan's conduct into broader context, too much to the significance
of a single figure. But Bix has made a worthwhile contribution to
the field, so that if you are going to read several volumes,
``Hirohito and the Rise of Modern Japan'' should be among them.

RETIREES SEEK MAXIMIZED RETURNS IN TAX-DEFERRED ACCOUNTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. We both retired this year. Our investments are all in
tax-sheltered vehicles and have been accumulated through
employer-assisted and voluntary contributions.
</P>
<P>
   We have no intention of touching them before age 70 1/2, but we
would like to maximize the returns in the next seven years. We have
enjoyed returns of up to 20 percent in the four or five years up to
1999, which was quite painful. There seems to be a bit of a rebound
in the market, which we can endure, but can we do better in terms
of safety and return? Our long-term plan was to have $500,000 by
the year 2008. Is this realistic?
</P>
<P>
   D.M., Orange, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. I think the target is pretty realistic. To get to that half
million over the course of the next 87 months you would need to
achieve average 7.51 percent investment returns.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to get to your goal begs another question, which is
whether you view the growing pool as funds that will finance your
living expenses at the point when you will have to take
distributions from these accounts, or simply as long-term savings
that will protect you for emergencies and against inflation. If
it's the latter case, I think that you're pretty well poised.
</P>
<P>
   In your letter you specify the assorted funds you are using in
the variable annuity and in the American Funds portfolio, but there
is no breakdown of how the money is allocated. I would hope, in the
interest of safety, that your Variable Annuity account is about
evenly divided between the two stock accounts and the two
fixed-income accounts. The American Funds portfolio lists four
stock funds and a money market account. I would certainly ditch the
latter in favor of a good bond fund, given your intermediate-term
time frame. I would suggest a move to Bond Fund of America, which
has returned 6.30 percent over the past five years and 8.62 percent
over the last ten. Otherwise you could leave the account as it is,
both now and after you have to begin taking withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're viewing this as a source of your income stream, I
would begin now to move the allocation away from stocks and toward
a more balanced portfolio. American Balanced fund is a workmanlike,
if conservative, entry in that category. Within the same family,
Income Fund of America is also solid, and even more conservatively
oriented.
</P>
<P>
   One or both would be a good swap for some of the stock funds if
you view this as a potential income account.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are we on the right track toward retirement income and
partial payment toward college education for our three children,
aged from one to five?
</P>
<P>
   D.G., Palmer, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   A. You are, of course, in lovely shape, and your portfolio is
very nicely balanced -- especially in view of the fact that your
common stock positions are not likely to cause you the tax
headaches, as you approach retirement, that having everything in
mutual funds might bring.
</P>
<P>
   I excluded your emergency savings and checking balance in
calculating (somewhat randomly, since you did not set a target
retirement age) that you might have $7,476,328 at age 62 if you
kept contributions at current levels and achieved overall annual
portfolio returns of 10 percent. That calculation assumed a
midpoint $8,500 in contributions to your 401(k) account. It also
assumed that you have both 401(k) accounts in stock investments,
which seems a safe guess given your other investments.
</P>
<P>
   If you estimate inflation at 3.5 percent, that would be the
equivalent of about $2.95 million in today's money -- more than
enough to maintain your current life style and to deal with future
inflation. The accumulation might be a little less if some of the
savings were diverted to pay your children's college costs, but
there certainly should be plenty.
</P>
<P>
   What would I change? You list no ongoing contributions to your
assorted common stock accounts. The nice thing about these accounts
is that you are likely to get fewer tax surprises from common stock
holdings than funds.
</P>
<P>
   If the stocks pay dividends, you can calculate pretty closely
what the tax effect is likely to be. If not, all of their market
performance rings up as unrealized capital gains, which cannot be
taxed until they are realized.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual funds, on the other hand, can deliver both income and
capital gains distributions, and the latter usually arrive in an
irregular pattern.
</P>
<P>
   To give you an idea of how this would work out, consider what
would happen if you kept plugging away at a $350-a-month pace
building the Fidelity Blue Chip Growth account for 27 years. At the
end of that time, the account would be $1,179,289, following the
same assumption of 10 percent average growth. During the final
year, more than $90,000 of that accumulation would come from
internal growth. Chances are that distributions from the fund would
create considerable tax headaches -- enough so that you may have to
consider selling shares to cover the liability.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, I suggest you divert about $200 a month from
your fund investments into the same kind of blue chip stocks you
now hold. I particularly like your Lucent Technologies and Schering
Plough selections and would increase both positions by reinvesting
their meager dividends and buying shares through their DRIPs.
</P>
<P>
   I have no argument with your fairly speculative technology
investments, but I wouldn't tread too heavily there. I used the
figures you supplied in your letter of early September, ut I also
note that all three positions have eroded considerably in the two
weeks between then and when this was written; stick with the big
guys for most of your stock investments.
</P>
<P>
   I also suggest that you pay more attention to IRAs. Since the
balance in your IRA accounts hints that you have not been
aggressive IRA savers, I would change this, with both you and your
wife putting $2,000 a year that you are now saving in the taxable
mutual fund accounts into Roth IRAs. This step also would reduce
your likely tax problems both before and after retirement. You
could use the same funds you are now using, simply changing the tax
status of the account.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I will contribute $4,000 yearly into the IRA accounts and
another $3,000 to $4,000 into other savings. We do not have a high
overhead lifestyle. I have no 401(k) plan available to me through
my work. At this rate, can I retire at age 60?
</P>
<P>
   S.W., Thousand Oaks, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. I hate this kind of question, because it's clear, with
savings that represent nearly 20 percent of your income, that you
are working very hard. And it's equally clear that at the rate you
are going, retiring at age 60 looks pretty tough.
</P>
<P>
   In making my projection, I assumed total savings at a $7,750
annual rate, and excluded the money you have saved for your
daughter. The current pool would grow to $393,605 over the course
of 18 years, given monthly contributions of $645. If inflation
averaged 3.5 percent over the course of those 18 years, your pool
would have the buying power of about $212,000 in today's money.
</P>
<P>
   Things would look better at age 65, when the pool would be
$697,597, with the buying power of about $315,000 in today's money.
Probably an income stream that could be realized from such a pool
would combine with Social Security to provide you with an
acceptable retirement income at age 65.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry to be such a poop. Things could be brighter if you decide
to continue your savings as a percentage of your income and to
raise the levels as your income increases.
</P>
<P>
   But still, it's likely to be a tough row, and retirement at 65
looks a lot more realistic than at 60.
</P>
<P>
   As for your investments, I am presuming that you are treating
the $15,000 in the money market account as emergency savings,
rather than retirement savings. That's fine, but I'd make sure that
the lion's share of your future savings -- if not all -- go into
the stock funds from which you should expect higher growth.

 By CLAIRE WHITCOMB   
 c.2000 Hearst Communications Inc.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, Dr. Jane Goodall, famous for her work with
chimpanzees in Tanzania, went to a scientific conference on
conservation. She arrived a field researcher and left an
environmental missionary, galvanized by what she had learned about
pollution, deforestation and the precarious state of the world.
``Things were much worse than I realized,'' she recalls. Now 66,
she travels relentlessly _ 300 days a year _ delivering a heartfelt
message: The time for action is now, each individual can make a
difference and, yes, there is reason for hope.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Goodall is early. She's scheduled to meet 50 or so students
participating in her pet project, Roots &AMP; Shoots, an environmental
education program for young people. Only a few teen-agers have
shuffled into a meeting room at Western Connecticut State
University in Danbury. Goodall, who has spent two-thirds of her
life studying primate behavior, stands quietly, observing. Her
manner is so peaceful that in a flash you understand how she spent
all those months in the forests of Gombe, Tanzania, holding just as
still, waiting for the chimpanzees to lose their fear and let her
into their world.
</P>
<P>
   The momentary stillness is broken by two fourth-graders, Rachel
and Ali, who arrive bursting with excitement. It's all they can do
not to jump up and down. Being introduced to ``Dr. Jane'' renders
them speechless. A teacher explains that they have formed the first
Roots &AMP; Shoots program at Judson Elementary School. Bending over,
Goodall asks, ``When I come back next year, how many of your
friends will you have roped in? At least 10?'' The girls nod.
Goodall gives them Mr. H. the monkey, her stuffed-animal mascot, to
parent for the morning.
</P>
<P>
   The room is filling up. A kindergarten class comes in wearing
homemade hats trimmed with paper roses and leaves. A high-school
group brings along a papier-mache termite mound, a reminder of
Goodall's breakthrough discovery: that chimpanzees use tools,
specifically sticks, to fish out termites. As these students know,
in 1960, tool-using behavior was thought to be unique to humans.
But Goodall, 26-year-old protegee of renowned anthropologist Louis
Leakey, was privileged to see David Greybeard, the first chimp to
befriend her, stripping leaves off a branch and helping himself to
a termite snack. The discovery launched her career and began her
research.
</P>
<P>
   Goodall welcomes the students with a chimpanzee hoot. The goal
of the meeting is not for her to lecture but to encourage. One by
one the various groups tell her how they've planted trees,
sponsored Earth Day events, created lesson plans and raised money
for her various programs. A head-shaving contest netted $310, a pet
show another $50. She tells them, ``It's your energy that keeps me
going.''
</P>
<P>
   It does. When tea time approaches, talk turns to the fact that
she could be out raising substantial sums of money instead of
devoting a day to relatively small groups of students. ``Spending
my time fund-raising would negate the whole point of what I'm
trying to do,'' Goodall explains. ``I'd have to sit at a different
level and have other people do the grass roots.'' She pauses.
``It's terribly hard work.'' Her beloved mother, Vanne Goodall, who
joined her during the initial research at Gombe, has recently died
at the age of 94. Goodall has barely slowed down to grieve. Given
the state of the world, she doesn't feel there's time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to think that a huge amount of the world's problem
isn't malice. It's ignorance,'' she says. ``The question is, have
we got time for illumlimation, or will we be snuffed out before we
get there?'' The rain forest is disappearing at a rate of two acres
a second. There are fewer than 2,500 wild chimpanzees living in
Tanzania's parks _ a quarter of the number Goodall encountered 40
years ago. She asks what will become of our closest animal
relation? (The genetic makeup of chimps and humans differs by
roughly 1 percent, researchers say.) What will become of the chimps
she's befriended, whose children and grandchildren she's seen grow
up? She talks of Fifi, a baby in 1960. She's now more than 40 and
may have another 10 years to live. ``Some memories from the 1960s
are common to her and me alone,'' says Goodall.
</P>
<P>
   Though she admits the world's situation keeps her awake at
night, Goodall remains an optimist. She titled her recent memoir
``Reason for Hope'' (Warner Books) and lists among her reasons the
resilience of nature, human ingenuity and the enthusiasm of youth.
She believes in roots and shoots _ literally. ``Roots creep
underground everywhere and make a firm foundation,'' she explains.
``Shoots seem very weak, but to reach the light they can break open
brick walls. This is why I'm putting all my last energies into
education. Children get the fact that they can make a difference,
even small children.'' Indeed in a short amount of time her
education program has grown to encompass more than 1,100 groups in
51 countries including, to her amazement, China.
</P>
<P>
   With adults, Goodall has to work harder to ignite enthusiasm,
but she never preaches. She simply travels as a messenger of hope.
Whenever Goodall lectures or meets with children, she shows her
hope collection: a feather from the once-endangered condor, a leaf
from a gnarled tree that escaped nuclear destruction at Nagasaki, a
piece of limestone from the quarry where Nelson Mandela worked,
plus treasures people give her at every turn. She talks about a
``hope board'' that a Shanghai school established. The children
started collecting stories about good things and soon the bulletin
board was overflowing and clippings lined the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   Spreading hope, which entails traveling most of the year and
losing her luggage, as she's done twice in the past two days, is
the most rigorous of callings. Goodall accepts it as an outgrowth
of her deep spirituality, something she's outlined with rare
forthrightness in her book. She's learned over the years to carry
what she describes as ``the peace of the forest'' with her.
</P>
<P>
   In what is now Gombe Stream National Park, away from the
developed world and the stresses of modern living, she lived with
freedom and stillness. ``I think all my students have found the
same thing,'' says Goodall. The forest in its timelessness, the
chimpanzees in their caring and community, have touched her deeply.
``Everyone says to me, 'You seem so peaceful.' They ask, 'Do you
meditate?' I suppose in my own way I do,'' Goodall says, in an
effort to explain how she carries peace with her. ``Every time I
have to take a different direction, all these questions come up. I
go through them until I'm fairly confident I'm doing the right
thing. When a day's work is done, it's done. I've learned to keep
silly, circling thoughts at bay.''
</P>
<P>
   Her focus is unwavering, her day's work monumental. In addition
to Roots &AMP; Shoots, Goodall lectures constantly and oversees the
Jane Goodall Institute, a global organization promoting wildlife
research, education and conservation. And she continues her
research at Gombe, returning three or four times a year. ``I keep
up by e-mail. I watch videos. But,'' she says in a very quiet
voice, ``I have to leave the place I love in order to save it.''

 North American Rights Only  
 By LORI LEIBOVICH  
 c.2000 Hearst Communications Inc.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first time Betsy Morgan brought her husband, Chad Gifford,
home to meet her family, her father walked up to Gifford and got
right to the point. ``How much money does an archaeologist make?''
he demanded.
</P>
<P>
   It might have been a reasonable question since Gifford, who had
yet to begin graduate school in archaeology at Columbia University,
wasn't even clearing $15,000 a year _ except for the fact that
Morgan herself was on her way to becoming a network executive at
CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to her salary, the couple, both in their early 30s, live
in an apartment just steps from Manhattan's Central Park and
vacation in places like Italy, Patagonia and Napa Valley. Morgan
works 12- to 14-hour days and many weekends, while Gifford has a
flexible but busy schedule that includes teaching and traveling
abroad to do research, a lifestyle made all the more comfortable by
the fact that Morgan pays for some of his incidentals _ computer,
plane tickets _ and the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Like Morgan, more and more American women are finding themselves
in the role of breadwinner today. Carly Fiorina runs the technology
giant Hewlett-Packard while her husband, Frank, took early
retirement from his executive position at AT&AMP;T to spend more time
with the family. Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs
James Rubin recently resigned from his appointment so that he could
move to London with his wife, CNN's globe-trotting correspondent
Christiane Amanpour, and raise their new baby boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of jokes about diapers and Mr. Mom,'' says
Rubin, who was ribbed ceaselessly by his friends and colleagues
about his decision to be a stay-at-home dad. ''(But) marriage is
about compromise,'' he says. ``This is a time for me to compromise
in her direction, and another time, she will compromise in my
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, almost one-third of
married women in the United States outearned their husbands in
1998. ``This is a trend that is going to strengthen if women
continue to receive more education than men, which they will,''
says Harvard University economist Richard Freeman. ``If women
continue to earn more money, a power shift within the family will
almost inevitably occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Cooper, now a 34-year-old television producer at ABC
News in Washington, D.C., didn't plan on becoming the family
breadwinner when she met Doug Dupin seven years ago. After dating
``a stream of former high school student-council presidents'' _ and
even a few members of Congress _ the budding reporter was charmed
by the offbeat Dupin, who was waiting tables at a restaurant. ``I
was definitely attracted to the fact that he wasn't a typical
Washington guy,'' says Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Dupin took a job at the Defense Department as a
cartographer, and Cooper's journalism career took a sudden detour
into politics: She became chief of staff to Bill Richardson, who
was, at that time, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. While
Cooper reveled in a hectic job where she commuted between D.C. and
New York, Dupin soon found his gig less than thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I encouraged him to quit,'' says Cooper, laughing. ``But I
thought he'd quit to do something else!''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, after searching for months to find an interesting job,
Dupin decided he would renovate the house next door, which they now
rent out for extra income. Then he started designing and selling
skateboards over the Internet. Though the business was a lot of
fun, and he worked tirelessly to get it off the ground, it was
hardly lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a job at ABC in New York, Cooper's expenses became
astronomical. By 1999, the couple were living in separate cities
because of her job. Cooper found herself juggling rent in New York,
mortgage payments in Washington plus commuting costs. ``And there's
my husband selling skateboards and not making any money,'' she
says. Finally, she confronted him. ``I said, 'Enough. We can't do
this financially or emotionally.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dupin agreed to get back behind a desk and took a job with the
Department of Agriculture. ``Whenever you lack marital bliss,
finances always seem to be at the center of it,'' he says. Though
Dupin still works at his skateboard business on the side, and still
makes less than half of what his wife makes, the couple's tensions
about money have subsided.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you respect what your partner is doing,'' says Cooper,
``and if you don't think you have to do all the work, you can make
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Cooper and Dupin, Laura and Jack (not their real names)
found that simply reversing the stereotypical roles in which one
partner toils silently as the only income source was untenable. As
an executive at a large Internet company, Laura's mid-six-figure
salary easily dwarfed her husband's sporadic earnings as a
documentary filmmaker. When they first moved in together, Jack was
between jobs, while Laura was working furiously for promotion after
promotion. She was paying the rent, handling the bills and giving
Jack $500 every two weeks for incidentals. Jack, meanwhile, was
spending his afternoons at Yankee Stadium. ``I tried not to be a
nag,'' says Laura. ``I tried to play the low-key girlfriend. But it
didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentally, it was Jack who was more comfortable with the
idea of a woman assuming sole financial responsibility for the
household. Laura, on the other hand, had to confront a relic of her
own upbringing. ``I had to get used to the idea that I would be the
breadwinner,'' she says. ``An itsy-bitsy part of me had a fantasy
that I would get married and be taken care of.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the knight in a pin-striped suit is a potent fantasy for
many women. Barbara Corcoran, the 51-year-old chairman of the
Corcoran Group, has built a thriving New York real estate business
with more than 550 sales agents and $2 billion in annual sales
thanks in part to her loving husband, Bill Higgins, whose job is
caring for Tommy, the couple's 6-year-old son, accompanying
Corcoran on business trips and acting as a sounding board for her
end-of-the-day kvetching. ``He's the ideal corporate wife,''
Corcoran says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is she, not Higgins, who has had the harder time
adjusting to their roles. ``Somewhere in the back of my head, I
still have that lingering hope that I will be Cinderella,'' she
admits. ``I had to become my own prince.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all this can leave some women of means feeling that
power, money and success aren't as liberating as feminism once
promised them they would be: ``Feminism has done us wrong,'' says
one head of an advertising agency. ``I am sick of making a salary,
having the babies, getting the mortgage. I just want to go back to
the old days of having a lord and master. He can make the money, he
can make the decisions, he can have the power. I'll take the home
and the babies, thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   A relationship of equals in a household where the woman pays the
bills is still a work in progress _ a balancing act of egos,
desires and expectations. But Morgan, the CBS executive, and her
archaeologist husband are remarkably well-adapted to the
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   One key ingredient to domestic bliss is a sense of common
control over the family fortunes, both figuratively and literally.
``Chad and I share a very similar financial value system, and
that's been a huge help,'' says Morgan. ``We're both savers.'' She
has been careful never to use her salary for leverage. ``I don't
think I've ever made Chad feel bad because he didn't pay the
rent,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford, for his part, is careful about his expenses. ``He still
wears some clothes from college, and he certainly isn't paying $80
to get his hair cut,'' says Morgan. ``Would Chad and I get along so
well if he had much higher maintenance costs? Probably not. If he
was spending our disposable income on Prada shoes or a
contemporary-art collection _ well, that would likely become a
point of conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there are the intangible benefits of
supporting a creatively inclined, if economically insignificant,
other. Cooper says she loves being at Washington dinner parties
where her skateboard-designing husband is the only one who doesn't
work in journalism or politics. ``I've been told by a number of
people that we are the coolest couple they know,'' she says, ``and
it's not because of me!''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Some 13 million Americans suffer from thyroid disorders, most of
them women, including Barbara Bush, Tipper Gore and Olympic track
star Gail Devers. But more than half don't know it.
</P>
<P>
   Thyroid disorders, experts say, are among the most undiagnosed
and misdiagnosed problems in the United States. Doctors generally
don't examine the thyroid. Disorders come on slowly, and the
symptoms can be ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The test, which is a simple blood test, is not part of a
routine exam and is becoming less so because of managed care,''
said Dr. Robert J. McConnell, a thyroid specialist and an associate
attending physician at New York Presbyterian Hospital. ``Managed
care groups don't like fishing expeditions. They don't like to pay
for tests for no good reason.''
</P>
<P>
   So the test is usually ordered only if the patient demands it or
if the doctor suggests it, McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Awareness is critical for women, who, for as yet unexplained
reasons, are eight times more at risk than men. ``It probably has
something to do with the immune system,'' said Dr. Lawrence C.
Wood, the president and medical director of the Thyroid Foundation
of America and a co-author of ``Your Thyroid.'' ``Thyroid
inflammation is caused by a foul-up in the immune system, and women
seem to be more affected by autoimmune diseases like lupus,
muscular sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman's susceptibility is increased by certain factors, Wood
said: a family history of thyroid disease; pregnancy (about 5
percent to 10 percent of women develop postpartum thyroid
problems); aging (at least 1 woman in every 10 has signs of a
failing thyroid by age 50); smoking; and menopause. Because
symptoms are nonspecific, they are often ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many women go to doctors for years with the same coterie of
symptoms and are told that they're stressed, depressed, PMS-ed,
getting older, menopausal or tired because they're working and have
two children,'' said Mary J. Shomon, author of ``Living Well With
Hypothyroidism'' and founder of a Web site (www.thyroid.about.com)
and a patient-advocacy newsletter. ``And women tend to write their
symptoms off too quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Several months after Susan Kane gave birth to her son, she
noticed that she was starving all the time. ``I would often get up
twice in the middle of the night and have a complete meal,'' she
said. Kane, who lives outside New York City and is the editor of
BabyTalk magazine, thought her body was signaling the need for more
calories to support her breast-feeding. Then her weight plummeted
to seven pounds less than before she was pregnant, and she
developed heart palpitations, insomnia, muscle weakness and
protruding eyes. Even then, Kane, who is in her early 40s, figured
that she was out of shape and stressed from the baby.
</P>
<P>
   Her doctor at the time said it was anxiety. Then one day her
heart was racing so wildly, she rushed to a cardiologist. ``He put
two and two together and sent me to an endocrinologist,'' she said.
The diagnosis? Graves' disease, an overactive thyroid condition
that speeds up metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   Rosanna Bruno, 30, a Brooklyn artist, felt out of breath just
walking up a flight of stairs. She gained weight and developed
digestive problems, along with cramps in her legs and hands. But it
was the hair loss that finally sent her to the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   She was told she was depressed and should be on medication. She
went to a psychotherapist. ``I would tell her, 'Yesterday my leg
felt numb.' And she would say: 'Let's talk about what it means to
be numb. Are you trying to disappear?''' Finally, Bruno saw a
doctor outside her HMO. The diagnosis? Underactive thyroid, or
hypothyroidism, which slows the metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   Although the thyroid has a low profile in the medical universe,
it plays a major role in the body. This butterfly-shaped gland at
the base of the neck makes key hormones _ thyroxine (T4) and
triiodothyronine (T3), which affect metabolism, growth, nerves,
muscles and circulation. The thyroid is kept in check by the
pituitary gland, which sends the thyroid-stimulating hormone.
</P>
<P>
   But autoimmune disease, infection, hormonal imbalance or
hereditary conditions can cause the thyroid to malfunction. Thyroid
problems fall into two categories: functional, like hypothyroidism
and hyperthyroidism; and structural, like nodules and goiters.
</P>
<P>
   Hypothyroidism occurs when the gland produces too little hormone
and the metabolic rate slows down; the most common cause is
Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune disease that creates
antibodies that attack the thyroid gland.
</P>
<P>
   Hyperthyroidism results when the gland produces too much hormone
and the metabolic rate speeds up; the most common cause is Graves'
disease, an autoimmune condition that creates antibodies that
stimulate the thyroid.
</P>
<P>
   Nodules are growths on the thyroid; most are noncancerous,
though they should be screened. A goiter is a swelling in the
throat caused by an enlarged thyroid. It is generally caused by a
lack of iodine and is rare in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of treatment is to return thyroid hormone levels to
normal _ left unchecked, hypothyroidism can cause heart disease and
high cholesterol. Because an underactive thyroid is not producing
enough T4 hormone, hormone replacement is prescribed; common brands
of synthetic thyroxine are Synthroid, Levoxyl and Levothroid. (As
an alternative, Shomon said, some patients respond better to a
natural thyroid hormone derived from pigs; a common brand is Armour
Thyroid.)
</P>
<P>
   For an overactive thyroid, which produces too much hormone,
there are three options: radioactive iodine, a one-time oral
treatment that destroys the gland; antithyroid drugs, which have a
success rate of 1 out of 3; or surgery to remove the gland.
</P>
<P>
   When the gland is destroyed, hyperthyroid patients become
hypothyroid and need to take daily hormone medication. Left
unchecked, hyperthyroidism can lead to heart failure and
osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   Medication may take some fine-tuning. ``Some people who are
taking just the T4 hormone may be suffering with continued
symptoms,'' Shomon said. ``The conventional wisdom among more
conservative endocrinologists is that your body will convert the T4
hormone into the T3 hormone. But a New England Journal study in
1999 found that some people seem to be deficient in the T3 hormone
or are unable to convert it for whatever reason, and they do better
with an additional T3 supplement.''
</P>
<P>
   For her overactive thyroid, Kane initially was given Levoxyl.
``But I was still feeling tired,'' she said. ``I happened to pick
up a book by an endocrinologist who recommended lowering the
Levoxyl and adding Cytomel, which is the synthetic form of T3. My
doctor agreed, changed my medication, and I felt better within a
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Since she got her diagnosis, Kane has tried to raise other
people's awareness of thyroid problems. She frequently covers them
in her magazine, because they can powerfully affect pregnancy and a
mother's ability to function. ``Now, whenever a friend tells me she
feels tired, I tell her to get her thyroid tested,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And if a doctor says it's all in your head? ``Find another
doctor,'' she said.

 By CHARLES W. SCHMIDT  
 c.2000 Child magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a very young child, Alex Fenyn, now 7, exasperated his
parents and teachers and intimidated peers with his hyperactive and
aggressive behavior. He was extremely cranky as an infant and had a
bloodcurdling scream that made him sound like he was being
tortured, says his mother, Tracy McNair, 42, a consultant from New
York City. His parents even gave him the nickname ``Mr.
Intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   In preschool and kindergarten, he was impulsive and unable to
sit down. Because Alex's classmates found his behavior so
frightening, he was usually left to play by himself.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point in Alex's life came at age 5, with a clinical
diagnosis of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and a
prescription for Ritalin, which his mother describes as a ``miracle
drug.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect was immediate,'' she says. ``He had less trouble
going from one activity to the next and would negotiate for a toy
instead of grabbing it. After three weeks, his classmates started
to warm up to him, which is what I was hoping for. I wanted him to
gain some self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   In what many see as a kind of vast, national experiment,
millions of children in the United States are taking drugs
prescribed by doctors to help manage mental and emotional health
problems at ever-younger ages. And the number of kids on medication
is rising.
</P>
<P>
   A study by Dr. Julie Magno Zito at the University of Maryland
School of Pharmacy in Baltimore found that as many as 1.5 percent
of American children between the ages of 2 and 4 are taking
stimulants such as Ritalin, as well as antidepressants and
antipsychotics. According to Zito's findings, stimulant use in this
age group (Ritalin in 90 percent of the cases) rose two- to
threefold from 1991 to 1995, while the rate of antidepressant
prescriptions nearly doubled during the same time period.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more kids begin taking medications for psychiatric
problems, the lack of safety data is becoming an urgent problem,
especially in younger age groups, says Dr. Harold S. Koplewicz,
vice chairman of the department of psychiatry at the New York
University School of Medicine in New York City. ``We have a
critical need to conduct further studies of the long-term safety of
these medications in children,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jerry Rushton, a pediatrician at the University of Michigan
School of Medicine in Ann Arbor, says that clinicians simply know
more about childhood mental illnesses now than they did in the past
_ and with this knowledge has come a rise in the number of
diagnoses and prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rushton, heightened awareness among clinicians
stems in part from mental health research conducted during the
1990s, which provided evidence that identifiable,
biologically-based mental illnesses, such as depression, can occur
in children as young as 2 or 3 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor underlying the rise in prescriptions, says
Rushton, is the emergence of a new class of drugs called selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors, including Prozac, Zoloft and Paxil,
which have fewer, less serious side effects than the previous
generation of antidepressants. They have been increasingly
prescribed over the last decade by pediatricians for treating
depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and anxiety in children.
</P>
<P>
   Does the rising use of medications indicate that rates of mental
illnesses are actually increasing among children?
</P>
<P>
   ``For over a decade there have been observations among teachers
and pediatricians of increasing behavioral disturbances in
children,'' says Dr. Barry Zuckerman, chairman of the department of
pediatrics at the Boston University School of Medicine. ``We don't
know if it has to do with changing communities, family structure,
TV video games or anything else, but there is a perception that
behavioral disturbances are on the rise.''
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is ADHD, which has become increasingly common in
the years since it was first described by the American Psychiatric
Association in 1980. In 1987, the APA redefined the criteria for
diagnosing ADHD to include individuals with either hyperactivity or
impulsive behavior, and not necessarily both, as was previously the
case. The result was a skyrocketing increase in the number of ADHD
diagnoses.
</P>
<P>
   Figures released by the APA in May indicate that anywhere from 4
percent to 12 percent of all American children _ some 2.5 million _
are now thought to have the disorder, making it the most common
pediatric mental illness in the United States. And according to
Zito, the dramatic rise in prescriptions for Ritalin can be linked
directly to the increased national caseload of pediatric ADHD.
</P>
<P>
   Parents who consult a professional about their child's behavior
will likely confront a managed care system widely viewed by
clinicians and patients as inadequate or unresponsive where mental
health coverage is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that when it comes to mental illness,
managed care interferes with diagnosis,'' says Dr. Alan Wachtel, a
clinical associate professor at New York University Medical Center
in New York City and author of ``The Attention Deficit Disorder
Answer Book.''
</P>
<P>
   Many insurance companies restrict access to psychiatric
specialists, limit the number of visits for psychotherapy and
encourage primary care physicians to prescribe medications rather
than to try longer-term psychosocial interventions. And, according
to Koplewicz, most children are evaluated for mental illness not by
child psychiatrists, but by pediatricians, many of whom have little
training in mental health.
</P>
<P>
   By refusing to cover the cost of psychiatric referrals, managed
care companies are limiting the resources available to
pediatricians, he says, which may add pressure to reach for the
prescription pad.
</P>
<P>
   Experts, including Koplewicz, say that children with mental
illness who don't get treatment are likely to suffer from negative
self-esteem and poor relationships with others, and are at a much
higher risk of delinquency, occupational problems and suicide later
on in life.
</P>
<P>
   If you are worried that your pediatrician cannot devote the time
needed to conduct a comprehensive mental health evaluation because
of an overwhelming schedule, ask for a recommendation to a
qualified expert who can conduct a thorough assessment, which
should include in-depth interviews with the child, parents and
teachers, and a review of school records and family history.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many pediatricians feel pressure to prescribe
medications for mental and emotional health problems simply as a
way to do something for a child in light of the limitations managed
care places on physicians, says Dr. Peter Jensen, the director of
the Center for the Advancement of Children's Mental Health at the
Columbia University School of Medicine in New York City. But, he
says, the decision to medicate should be based on the severity of
the child's illness as determined by a comprehensive evaluation
that takes into account the age and developmental maturity of the
child.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the largest studies of its kind ever conducted, a team
of researchers at six sites around the country, led by Jensen,
followed 579 children with ADHD for 14 months to assess their
progress with various forms of treatment. The researchers found
that medication was substantially more effective than
behavior-modification therapy in treating children with ADHD alone.
In cases where children had problems in addition to ADHD, such as
depression or anxiety, combining medication with behavior therapy
provided an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Medical knowledge surrounding the most effective treatment of
mental illnesses in children is still evolving. Because so few of
these studies have been completed, a consensus among experts on the
benefits of medication over psychosocial approaches has yet to
emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, parents need to discuss all the available treatment
options with their pediatrician so they can make an informed
decision about what will be best for their child, says Koplewicz.
After the evaluation, he says, ``the critical thing is that you as
a parent understand the diagnosis, as well as the benefits and
risks of each treatment option under consideration.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LUANDA, Angola _ The young man dragged himself on cracked knees
and raw palms along a narrow dirt path, past snarling dogs, past
naked children, past drunkards standing around vats of crudely made
moonshine, toward a highway where he begs. His twin brother crawled
alongside him, two lives reduced by a virus.
</P>
<P>
   Polio.
</P>
<P>
   Marcou Ossi and his brother Joaquim are so poor that their home
is a bare concrete slab. They must share one pair of crutches _ and
one crutch has rubbed the skin off the back of Joaquim's left hand,
opening a festering wound. On his left ankle, blood drips from
another sore.
</P>
<P>
   This is surviving with polio in Angola. In this place, the Great
Crippler not only lives but thrives. For now.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 years after the last big summertime epidemic of
poliomyelitis swept through the United States, spreading hysteria
across the nation, a global effort to eliminate polio is in its
final stages _ soon to be down to the last 20 countries where
children still catch the virus.
</P>
<P>
   The effort is at the hardest stage. On Wednesday, the United
Nations will hold a polio summit, where world leaders and public
health specialists will pledge to stop transmission of the virus in
a little more than 15 months, with the goal of being able to
certify its demise by 2005. If that happens, polio would be only
the second disease afflicting humans ever to be eradicated,
following smallpox's elimination in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Setbacks have put the timetable in doubt. The barriers include
war, the logistics of immunizing millions of unvaccinated children,
and all but nonexistent national vaccine programs in several
African nations.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble also resides inside the four large agencies that are
trying to defeat the disease. The partners have often bickered over
credit in the march toward the historic feat and over assuming the
difficult leadership roles in war-torn countries.
</P>
<P>
   The intensive effort on polio comes at a time of much larger
health care crises around the globe, including the killer pandemics
of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, which account for a quarter
of all deaths worldwide. But the chance to eliminate polio for
good, its supporters say, offers multiple benefits, including a
$1.5 billion annual savings on vaccinations and the chance for
basic health services for the most vulnerable in the poorest of
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the humanitarian factor.
</P>
<P>
   The urgency of ridding the world of polio is acutely felt in
Angola, where new victims arrive daily at the Pediatric Hospital of
Luanda. One day this past summer, nine toddlers were flat on their
backs in cribs, their mournful mothers and fathers standing next to
them.
</P>
<P>
   The children, all under age 3, had been walking only a few days
before. Now none could.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-month-old Madalena Bernard, listless in crib No. 295 in
the isolation ward, was just learning to run, her mother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She started a fever and she stopped walking _ just two days
ago,'' said Georgina Pedro, 26, her eyes wide with disbelief. ``She
had a vaccination. Why did she catch it?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer for her daughter, and for children in much of Asia
and Africa, is that the virus circulates in places of squalor where
children do not have basic health services. It lies in wait for
those who have not had the full cycle of vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
   Polio harks back to ancient times. An Egyptian drawing dated
1380 BC depicts a priest with a withered leg, supported by a staff,
suggesting that the virus has infected humans for thousands of
years.
</P>
<P>
   Highly contagious, the virus passes through infected feces,
entering through a person's mouth either by drinking contaminated
water, on the hands of someone with the disease, or from unclean
utensils.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-sided virus _ it is among the smallest in the galaxy of
microbes _ settles in the throat and then the intestinal tract.
Most people have few or no symptoms. But if the virus enters the
brain, it can paralyze the muscles used in swallowing and
breathing. And if it invades the nerves of the spinal cord, it can
paralyze the arms, legs, or chest.
</P>
<P>
   In 1916, the first modern major epidemic swept through the
Western world, paralyzing 9,000 people and killing 3,000 more in
New York City alone. In the 1940s and early 1950s, summertime
outbreaks in the industrialized world disabled hundreds of
thousands of people, who were rushed to hospitals and encased
inside iron lungs _ metal tubes that aided in breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists raced to halt its spread. In 1954, Dr. Jonas Salk
introduced his injectable vaccine; seven years later, Dr. Albert
Sabin's oral vaccine entered the market.
</P>
<P>
   The same year, 1961, Cuba used the Salk vaccine to become the
first nation to eradicate the disease. The oral vaccine made the
job easier as it required only two drops into the mouths of
children.
</P>
<P>
   By 1988, after years of reluctance by the World Health
Organization to attack polio on a global scale _ it was seen as
diverting funds from other causes _ the stage was set for an
ambitious push. In the Americas, a major effort had shown that
eradication of polio could be accomplished even in nations
embroiled in civil wars or hampered by dismal health services. And
Rotary International, a group sometimes unfairly stereotyped as men
interested only in making business deals over lunch, had fervently
embraced the idea of eliminating polio, raising more than $246
million for the effort in the preceding three years.
</P>
<P>
   Thus prodded, the World Health Assembly, WHO's governing body,
that year called for the eradication of polio by the end of 2000.
In 1988, 125 countries in five continents were still reporting new
cases.
</P>
<P>
   If all had gone according to plan, Madalena Bernard, the
20-month-old girl in Angola, would have been among the last
children in the world to contract polio.
</P>
<P>
   But she won't be.
</P>
<P>
   With great fanfare on Jan. 6, the World Health Organization
leader, Gro Harlem Brundtland, and the UN Children's Fund executive
director, Carol Bellamy, declared that transmission of polio would
cease by the year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Brundtland said: ``In the year 2000 _ the target year for polio
eradication _ we have a window of opportunity to defeat this
disease forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten days after Brundtland's speech, WHO specialists told her
there was no way to eliminate polio this year, according to a
participant. The reasons centered on the vastness of the work and
the difficulties of reaching children in war. But UNICEF and WHO
analysts also had erred in underestimating the amount of vaccine
needed for the final push.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until May that Brundtland and Bellamy announced that
the goal would be pushed back to the end of 2002, with eradication
to be certified for 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened wasn't that people didn't do the job, but other
things intervened _ conflicts, HIV/AIDS, debilitated health
systems,'' Bellamy said in an interview. ``If we look ahead, to
2005, there's potential in virtually every place to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   But even that pushed-back goal seems optimistic, despite
significant gains.

 LUANDA, Angola: ... significant gains.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1999, the number of new cases was estimated at 20,000
worldwide, with laboratory-confirmed cases standing at 7,143; for
the first eight months of this year, the number of new confirmed
cases had dropped to 1,148. Officials cautioned that the numbers
could shoot up again during the next four months because of a
hang-up in lab certifications, but progress has been swift in
India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, which in 1999 accounted for 53
percent of all new cases. So far this year, the three countries
account for 31 percent of cases.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, scientists and health specialists inside the WHO,
UNICEF, US Centers for Disease Control, and Rotary International,
the four major polio fighters, said in interviews that the target
date almost surely will be missed in at least three African
countries: Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   All believe that eradication will eventually occur, but said the
virus could continue to be transmitted for several years after
2002, partly because the leaders of the polio-eradication drive
have decided now is not the time to publicly criticize countries
lagging in the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Some wish they would.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Angola, there have been national immunization days since
1995,'' said one exasperated senior UNICEF official, speaking on
the condition of anonymity. ``Five years later, we're saying the
quality of the immunizations is poor. Well, who's responsible for
overseeing quality? And why is it still poor five years after we
start?''
</P>
<P>
   Ciro A. de Quadros, head of the division of vaccines and
immunization at the Pan American Health Organization in Washington,
has worked on disease eradication for 33 years, beginning with
smallpox. He said partners must put aside differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is terrible mismanagement in some of the countries,'' he
said. ``The partners are not really working in tandem. They are
trying to compete. If they eliminate the competition . . . they
will beat this disease.''
</P>
<P>
   It now appears that the last stronghold of polio will be in
Africa, as it was for smallpox. Angola may be the most difficult
place, even though war in the Democratic Republic of Congo and lack
of coordination in Nigeria allow the virus to spread in those
countries.
</P>
<P>
   In Angola, at least a third of the country is inaccessible
because of a long civil war, fueled by sales of diamonds from
territory held by the UNITA rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The health of children in areas controlled by rebels is a great
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually I can't see how it wouldn't be in UNITA's best
interests to allow vaccinations, but that's not happening now,''
said Jane R. Zucker, who has coordinated UNICEF's polio effort. But
no one has started talks with rebel leaders in Angola.
</P>
<P>
   In the other two-thirds of the country, immunizations also have
failed to stop the virus. ``The reports,'' Zucker said, ``are
really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   During a national immunization day in July, 370 enthusiastic
volunteers walked door to door in the central city of Kuito, but
the effort was hampered by poor planning that did not cover several
popular outdoor events that day. At a large outdoor Roman Catholic
Mass, no immunizer was present until a UNICEF worker called one in.
And then church officials, surprised by the appearance of an
immunizer, ordered a stop to the vaccinations during Mass. The
volunteer ignored the officials, and in 90 minutes found 101
unvaccinated children under age 5 who had been missed in the
door-to-door effort.
</P>
<P>
   One who went to church was a smiling Paulo Mosso, 10, who
contracted polio when he was a toddler. He said he gets teased by
classmates, who have poked fun at him for his withered left leg.
</P>
<P>
   He said he ignores them and prefers to concentrate on happy
moments _ such as when the mother superior takes him to the front
of the church service, or when he had a cake on his 10th birthday,
or, recently, when the Red Cross gave him new crutches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, the crutches,'' he said, ``I love them. They have new
rubber on the tips. I can really walk better.''
</P>
<P>
   This is surviving with polio in Angola, where joy is a new pair
of crutches.
</P>
<P>
   But how will the world stop polio in Angola? There is some talk
of finding new intermediaries, such as the Catholic Church, to
approach UNITA. A few have even talked about sending in UN
peacekeepers _ but the idea seems far-fetched given the lack of
funding and the vast number of mines that line roads.
</P>
<P>
   For now, there are no answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 20 percent of the population is getting zero
vaccine,'' said an exasperated Robert Davis, a UNICEF health
adviser based in Nairobi, as he slumped in a chair in Luanda at the
end of two days of vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's shocking because nobody is taking care of these
children,'' said Oscar Castillo, UNICEF's health project officer in
Angola. ``And it's shocking because we make big speeches in
international forums without getting complete support on the
ground.''

AS GORE ADVANCES, DEMOCRATS SET SIGHTS ON HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Six weeks before the election, a confluence of
factors is giving Democratic officials renewed hope that they will
not only win the White House but that they will also capture a more
elusive prize: control of the US House.
</P>
<P>
   While all sides agree that the battle for the House will be one
of the closest in decades, Democratic candidates have been boosted
by factors ranging from Al Gore's
</P>
<P>
   surge to prescription drugs' emergence as a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Democrats are capitalizing on advantages they
had all along: an aggressive fund-raising machine, a flourishing
national economy, and the fact that they need a net gain of six
seats to take control in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans insist that they will maintain control of Congress
and that, as in the presidential race, the House elections favor
their candidates more than might be apparent. A Virginia
representative, Tom Davis, head of the committee in charge of
electing Republicans, says a Democratic sweep is ``not nearly as
likely as it might have been a year or six months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But few deny that for the the first time since 1994, the
Democrats appear genuinely capable of winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure anyone can say the House is going to go one way
or the other,'' said a prominent Republican pollster, Linda DiVall.
``It's a very competitive situation. . . . I think it's something
we probably won't know until election night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very tight,'' said Mark C. Allen, another Republican
pollster. ``Everything is in this very sort of equal balance.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, however, an analysis of House seats up for grabs,
as scrutinized daily by strategists on both sides, reflects a
picture that is tilted somewhat in favor of the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Most strategists agree that incumbents' seats are largely safe.
They expect perhaps as few as four congressmen to be defeated.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves both parties vying for 35 open seats. While 25
Republicans are vacating office, either to retire or run for higher
office, only 10 Democrats are doing so. On its face, this is a
clear advantage for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   That accounting is somewhat deceptive. At most, party
affiliations will change in 15 of those open seats.
</P>
<P>
   But according to numerous political analysts, even a slight
numerical advantage for the Democrats is critical, given how narrow
the margin is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race for the House could literally come down to one
seat,'' said Amy Walter, a political editor at the Cook Report.
``We've never seen anything like that in recent memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the numbers game initially inspired Democrats to try to
recapture the House, a combination of other forces, including a $60
million fund-raising spree, has heightened their optimism. Unlike
the presidential campaign, in which the effectiveness of issues and
advertising can be gauged at a national level, each House race must
be assessed on its own terms.
</P>
<P>
   And in select places, Democrats see glimmers of hope.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Don Sherwood, for example, is a Republican
incumbent who, after a tough election in 1998, worked to build
support in his northeastern Pennsylvania district. But the
district, where one-fifth of the residents are older than 65, also
fits into a central Democratic strategy: Emphasizing the rising
cost of prescription drugs for seniors, and the Republican
proposals to partially privatize Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the Democratic Party and the AFL-CIO have
launched an advertising blitz in the 10th District of Pennsylvania
focusing on those two issues, all with the intent of portraying the
Republican incumbent as insensitive to seniors' needs.
</P>
<P>
   And Sherwood, now in a rematch with his 1998 rival, Patrick
Casey, has felt the heat. Rather than ride the coattails of his
party's presidential nominee, coattails that many Republicans had
hoped might be much longer than they are today, Sherwood has been
forced to distance himself from the Medicare prescription drug plan
proposed by George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing Bush at a rally this month, Sherwood gave faint
praise to the GOP prescription drug plan, then said he expected to
``have to tweak it a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of seniors in that district, and prescription
drugs, combined with the traditional Democratic issue of health
care, is going to have an impact,'' said Stuart Rothenberg,
publisher of a nonpartisan newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Such may also be the case in the Florida seat held by
Representative Clay Shaw, a 20-year House veteran and a powerful
subcommittee chairman. Shaw, a respected member with name
recognition, was once considered a greater long-shot target for
Democrats than most. But he is also facing another weapon in the
Democratic arsenal: vast campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent in the 22d District race, Elaine Bloom, has
received about $1.6 million from the national Democratic Party.
That boost, Shaw said in an interview with the Palm Beach Post,
``turned this campaign into an invasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw is now, by one estimate, waging a campaign that could cost
up to $4 million in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican supporters have voiced fear that Shaw will
suffer from the presence of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman on the
Democratic presidential ticket, given the large Jewish population
in the south Florida district.
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg, who compiles a quarterly ratings sheet on the House
races, recently moved Shaw into a more endangered slot, calling his
reelection a ``question mark.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the rating suggests, Democrats are solidly
defending the seats they hold. One example is Representative Jay
Inslee, a freshman incumbent from Washington state, who had been
expected to be an easy target for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Inslee's district, just outside Seattle, has been inclined to
favor moderate Republicans. But the Democrat is faring far better
than expected; in an open primary, Inslee beat his opponent with 57
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   That partly results from a series of issue ads in a year when
``the issues work for him,'' said a media consultant Bill Carrick.
It also reflects what Walter called the ``generally pro-incumbent
mood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no throw-out-the-bums mentality,'' Walter said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who have 223 House incumbents on the ballot
compared with 210 for the Democrats, hope the mantle of incumbency
will work in their favor as well _ especially if Gore continues to
hold his own in the national polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The really surprising thing is that as Bush has tumbled a
bit,'' House Republicans have not lost ground, said Representative
Davis of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason is, people voting for Gore want to keep things the
way they are. If you reelect the president, you also reelect the
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   But the presidential race could have a more subtle effect.
</P>
<P>
   In northwestern Kentucky, for example, where Representative Anne
Northrup, a Republican, is locked in one of the more heated House
battles, Democrats expect the 3d District's preference for
President Clinton in 1992 and 1996 to draw Democrats to the polls
again this year.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, they say, may boost the chances of their
challenger, Eleanor Jordan, an African-American Democrat _ even if
Gore loses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a very good district for Republicans at this point,''
said Rothenberg, who moved Northrup into a more endangered category
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say that almost all of the Democratic tactics _ from
spending huge sums, to hammering the health care issue, to hoping
Gore will increase voter turnout _ could falter at any moment,
especially with so much time before Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   They also point to one recent glaring misstep: The primary loss
of Mike Forbes, the Long Island representative who switched to the
Democratic Party, and who was subsequently defeated.
</P>
<P>
   And analysts, wary of poll numbers in such a tight race, caution
against predictions.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who wins the House, it will be by a tiny margin,
possibly even smaller than the Republicans lead of 222 to 211
seats, several said. (There are also two independents.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like threading a needle,'' Walter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like in the Olympics, the luge: Where all they do is move
a pinky, and the entire sled flips into the air. That's what this
is like for the Democrats. If they have the right form and
everything falls into place, they could do it. But it's still very
tight and very tough.''

 &HT;    SENATE SETS SHOWDOWN ON VISA BILL
 &HT;    Eds: Updating a Friday story for all needing.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Senate showdown is set for Tuesday on a bill,
long-sought by the U.S. technology industry, to expand the number
of visas for skilled foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   With less than two weeks left before the Senate is scheduled to
adjourn, the high-tech industry is pressing for passage of the
bill, which would nearly double the number of H-1B visas for
skilled foreigners, to 200,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The industry says it is facing an extreme shortage of
high-skilled workers, and the only way to fill a shortfall of up to
400,000 jobs in the short term is to look abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., took two steps
Friday to force a decision.
</P>
<P>
   First, he filled the ``amendment tree'' _ the list of H-1B
amendments on which the Senate will vote _ with separate versions
of the main bill. That left no room for other immigration-related
amendments backed by the White House and the Congressional Hispanic
Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Then Lott scheduled a cloture vote to cut off debate on the bill
itself.
</P>
<P>
   If the cloture vote fails to attract the needed 60 votes, Lott
said, the popular visa bill would be dead for the year, and the
Democrats would be to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is critical to our nation,'' Lott said. ``We need to get
this done.''
</P>
<P>
   If cloture is approved, said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle
of South Dakota, the Democrats would seek another way to get the
immigration amendments passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is fair to say we will work with the White House to
ensure that by the end of this session, there will be a provision
that includes the Latino Fairness Act,'' he said. ``Our first
choice, of course, is H-1B, but if there are other options we'll
look into those.''
</P>
<P>
   The Latino Fairness Act would offer permanent residence to
political refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Haiti
_ a right already granted to people from Cuba and Nicaragua.
Another amendment would grant amnesty for as many as 2 million
undocumented immigrants who have lived in the United States since
1986.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of these provisions see a double standard in offering
visas to high-tech workers while the undocumented immigrants
already in this country are fighting for residency.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to do this for the high-tech workers, why
don't we do this for the Hispanics?'' Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
asked Friday.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Scott McNealy, chairman and CEO of Sun Microsystems, wrote in
USA Today last week that raising the cap on the number of skilled
workers allowed into the United States is necessary to keep the
economy on its high-tech roll.
</P>
<P>
   However, some contest whether there really is a shortage of
workers. James Lindsay, a senior fellow at the Washington-based
Brookings Institution, says there have been no high-quality studies
by objective observers done to support the claim there is a need
for immigrant workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a real question as to whether the high-tech industry has
done all it can to recruit from the existing (domestic) job pool,''
Lindsay said.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay also points out there has been evidence that some firms
like using H-1B workers as a source of cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (H-1B workers) are likely to be paid less than a
native-born worker. And their ability to hopscotch to a new job is
hurt by the fact that they can jeopardize their visa status by
doing so because they have to find a new sponsor and all that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of whether the market can continue to
absorb so many foreign workers. Intel, the biggest chip maker,
lowered its earnings estimates Thursday because of low demand. Some
may wonder whether the tech industry needs extra foreign workers if
it's heading into a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   But Connie Correll, a spokeswoman for the Information Technology
Industry Council, a trade group based in Washington, insists more
workers are still needed to fill the current demand. Correll points
out that the 115,000 H-1B visas allotted for this year ran out in
March, so there is a large backlog.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure in the short-term we can fill those
jobs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Correll, along with many lawmakers, says the H-1B bill is only a
temporary solution to a larger problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to focus on a long-term solution and that is
strengthening the U.S. education system so we don't have these
types of shortages in the future,'' Correll said.

   OSWIECIM, Poland _ Strobe lights flickered over the dance floor.
A state-of-the-art sound system pumped out the latest hits. Couples
flirted and eyed each other over their drinks.
</P>
<P>
   You could be out on the town anyplace in the world. But this is
from the Disco System, the hottest new nightclub in Oswiecim, just
over a mile from the Auschwitz concentration camp.
</P>
<P>
   But given its location, a tannery where Auschwitz prisoners
worked and died, the disco is also the subject of bitter
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal over Disco System illustrates a dilemma residents of
this sleepy hamlet in southern Poland live with every day: For most
of the world, Oswiecim was the scene of one of the 20th century's
most unspeakable crimes; but for 50,000 people, it is also home.
</P>
<P>
   The disco reverberates in a town that looks almost surreal in
its normalcy. The streets are clean, the lawns carefully manicured,
the apartment buildings well-kept. Earnest parents and fidgety kids
in their Sunday best file through the town's handsome Market Square
on their way to church.
</P>
<P>
   Locals will tell you that Oswiecim is not Auschwitz, which was
the German name for the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oswiecim is a town, not just a camp,'' said Wlodzimierz
Paluch, Oswiecim's deputy mayor.
</P>
<P>
   But Jewish groups and the Polish government say the Disco System
club insults the memory of the 1.5 million people, most of them
Jews, whom the Nazis murdered at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young Poles are being encouraged to dance in the immediate
vicinity of the largest Jewish graveyard in history,'' read a
recent statement released by the Simon Wiesenthal Center.
</P>
<P>
   The disco's management says it is on private property, is open
legally, and is outside a 100-yard-wide commercial-free perimeter
around the camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we need to remember and respect history, but people
here also want to live their lives,'' said Mariasz Loetoniak, the
nightclub's chief of security. ``Young people are leaving Oswiecim
because there is nothing for them to do. Businesses are afraid to
invest in the city since every project could cause a scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   Oswiecim is suffering economically. The city's largest employer,
a chemical plant, was forced to lay off 10,000 workers several
years ago. And although 500,000 people visit Auschwitz every year,
few spend any time in the town outside the camp.
</P>
<P>
   The Polish government has said it wants the disco moved, and
municipal authorities, who gave the club permission to open, also
are having second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course the city needs a disco for young people, but it
should be in a different place,'' said deputy mayor Paluch.
</P>
<P>
   Partying club patrons bristled at the suggestion that the disco
might be closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are young and we want to have fun,'' said Katazhena
Wasiela, a 21-year-old student who goes to the disco twice a week.
``This club is the best. There is super music and great
atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   The scandal surrounding the Disco System is just the latest in a
series of Auschwitz-related controversies in Oswiecim. During the
past several years there have been disputes over plans to build
both a shopping center and a commercial visitors center near the
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Oswiecim's mayor, Josef Krawchuk, has appealed to international
organizations for money to buy property connected to the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``The local government is too weak to buy up real estate that is
tied to blood and suffering,'' Krawchuk told visiting Jewish groups
earlier this month.

COLOMBIA'S INTELLECTUALS LIVING IN FEAR 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA _ To this day, Eduardo Pizarro isn't sure who tried to
kill him outside his university office last December, but he's
certain they wanted to send an unforgettable message.
</P>
<P>
   Pizarro was shot five times at close range by two men on a
motorcycle, just outside the university's large, gated campus here
in Colombia's capital. The bullets shattered Pizarro's left arm but
left him alive to wonder who did it _ and why.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt on his life happened three days after he had written
a column in a national newspaper critical of all three sides
involved in the country's decades-long civil conflict. He also
happened to be the brother of a former rebel and presidential
candidate who was assassinated 10 years ago. But most important,
perhaps, is that Pizarro, 50, was then the director of Colombia's
leading political research center at the National University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know whoever it was wanted to make a public statement by
trying to kill me,'' Pizarro says.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, Colombia's intellectuals and academics say they
dare not speak their mind, because someone won't like it and will
back up his displeasure with a kidnapping or even a bullet.
</P>
<P>
   No one seems to know exactly how many professors have been
threatened, kidnapped, or killed _ there is no government agency or
human rights group that keeps those kinds of statistics, and some
academics refuse to say publicly if they have been threatened.
Unofficially, however, it is believed that at least five professors
have been killed, attacked, or kidnapped during the past year.
</P>
<P>
   But stories like Pizarro's are becoming disturbingly commmon.
And many fear that accounts like these are already having a
chilling effect in a country which has long prided itself in having
one of Latin America's largest, most vocal and independent
intellectual and academic communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some of us who keep working, but frankly the danger
is so serious that we prefer the protection of being in exile,
silence, or being invisibile,'' said Marco Alberto Romero, chairman
of the political science department at the National University.
``But this is happening at a time when we most need a public debate
about the social and armed conflicts that are tearing this country
apart.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest victim was Hugo Iguran, 55, a professor at the
University of Cordoba, who was fatally shot by two men who burst
into his home two weeks ago while he was meeting with another
university official. Although no arrests have been made, the
agronomist had been an outspoken critic of the violence that has
overtaken his area of northern Colombia, where right-wing
paramilitary groups have kept a strong presence.
</P>
<P>
   Among Colombia's private and public institutions of higher
learning, the National University, located on a lush, open campus
in the southern section of the capital city, has probably been most
affected by the increase in fighting over the last three years
between the military and leftist guerrillas and right-wing
paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   Skirmishes on the campus three weeks ago between leftist
students and police _ on the same day that President Clinton made a
daylong visit to the country to promote a $1.3 billion US aid
package _ killed a 21-year-old officer.
</P>
<P>
   The university's Institute for Political Studies and
International Relations, whose professors regularly appear in
newspapers, magazines, and on television programs, currently has
half of its 14 members in exile because of threats from one side or
another.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Antonio Bejarano, another institute professor and a former
peace envoy, was gunned down in September by a hit squad _ in
retaliation, many of his former colleagues and friends believe, for
his public statements in support of a peaceful settlement to the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``More professors in recent years have taken a preference to
promoting peace rather than a left or right agenda, but that has
made us more vulnerable to threats,'' said Luis Alberto Restrepo,
another professor at the institute, which was created in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The National University is not the only beseiged campus in
Colombia. Battles between left and right have literally ripped
apart the University of Antioquia, Colombia's oldest public
college, in Medellin.
</P>
<P>
   Leftist guerrillas are believed to have planted the bomb that
exploded on campus in February 1999. Three months later,
paramilitary death squads claimed responsibility for killing a
philosophy student who was believed to be a leftist sympathizer.
That was followed later in the year by the murder of an
anthropology professor who was conducting research on peasants
displaced by the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The violence against intellectuals in Colombia isn't limited to
professors, but includes a wide range of jobs and people who affect
public opinion about the leftist guerrillas, the right-wing
paramilitary groups, or even the government and military. Scores of
journalists, analysts, writers, and even priests have been
threatened, kidnapped, or killed in order to silence them. Many
have chosen to leave Colombia for Spain, Mexico, or the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The result, students and teachers alike say, is a different
university community. Classes have to be rescheduled or canceled
when a professor leaves suddenly. There are fewer courses and
provocative lectures. Some instructors even refuse to get too
friendly with students anymore, for fear that they may be working
for a radical group on the left or right.
</P>
<P>
   This continued disruption to teaching will probably heighten the
``brain drain'' of young talent that leaves the country every year,
and it could have lingering consequences for the country's business
and social development.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great long-term risk for Colombia's future,'' said
Jose Vivanco, director of the Americas' division for the
Washington-based Human Rights Watch. ``We're seeing a country where
professors would say what they think _ to one where they're
self-censoring themselves to stay alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have been teaching longer say that threats or even
violence against professors or students is not new. Many academics
were in constant danger during the height of the war against deadly
drug lords in the 1980s. The difference this time is that many of
the recent attacks have violated the once-impenetrable sanctity of
the campus, and that it is become increasingly hard to tell where
the violence is coming from.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost impossible now to know who's doing the threats or
killings,'' said Pizarro, the exiled professor who _ from his new
teaching assignment at the University of Notre Dame _ still ponders
who it was who tried to kill him. ``So many of these actions are
carried out by people who are contracted by one side or another.
This conflict has created a new class of professional killers.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Like most journalists about to moderate a
presidential debate, Jim Lehrer says he has no political biases
that might get in the way of the job. But Lehrer seems to be truly,
deeply neutral, one measure of which is this _ he doesn't vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't voted since 1964,'' Lehrer said, sitting in his
office just outside Washington. ``I don't want to get my judgment
involved in what I do for a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer, 66, interviews public figures five nights a week on his
PBS broadcast, ``The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer,'' and has been doing
so for 25 years. He reads up on the issues as thoroughly as anyone
in the business, hangs out with pols, is clearly a player in the
Capital game.
</P>
<P>
   But not only does he not vote, he resolutely avoids forming
conclusions about candidates or their issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't have any politics,'' he said. ``I love
politics. I admire the people who put themselves on the line. But I
never take a stand.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not a matter of separating his personal views from his
public persona. ``No, no,'' he insisted. ``That's the way I am. I
have found the more I know about something, the less opinionated I
am about it.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder, then, that the official commission on presidential
debates and the two main presidential candidates had no hesitation
in picking Lehrer as the sole moderator of all three of next
month's matches between Al Gore and George W. Bush _ starting in
Boston on Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer's news show has a reputation in some circles for being
sober to a fault. (So did ``The MacNeil-Lehrer Hour,'' as it was
called before his partner, Robert MacNeil, left to write novels.)
The questions are considered ``soft'' _ meaning polite _ by news
talk-show standards; the devotion to even-handedness is sighed away
as a anachronism in an era of attitude.
</P>
<P>
   This view was expressed most scathingly by the radical
journalist, Alexander Cockburn, in a 1982 parody in Harper's that
imagined ``balanced'' MacNeil-Lehrer Hours on cannibalism (``Should
one man eat another?''), Jesus vs. Pontius Pilate (``Tonight, the
crucifixion debate''), the Holocaust (``And now for another view of
Hitler...''), and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   But it is this studied even-handedness, this utter
non-partisanship, this ego entirely under control that makes Lehrer
so greatly coveted as a debate-moderator.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had three criteria for a moderator,'' explained Janet
Brown, the commission's executive director. ``One: somebody who has
extensive experience in broadcasting live. Two: somebody familiar
with the candidates and the issues. Three _ and this is the
touchiest: somebody who knows that he or she is not the one whose
name is on the ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission assembled focus-groups to watch and comment on
past debates. They disliked moderators who treated the candidates
like pupils in a pop quiz (``Exactly how big is the deficit,
Senator?'') or tried to trip them up with ``Gotcha!'' questions.
</P>
<P>
   What they liked was a single moderator who asked questions that
allowed the candidates to speak at length and reveal who they are.
In short, they liked Jim Lehrer.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Gitlin, professor of communications at New York University,
agrees. Asked to explain Lehrer's appeal, he replied, ``I'm racking
my brains for any controversy with which he's ever been
associated.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gitlin slammed NBC's Tim Russert for injecting
himself so aggressively into the New York Senate debate between
Hillary Clinton and Rick Lazio earlier this month. ``Jim Lehrer,''
he said, ``is the anti-Russert.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer had no comment on the New York debate. ``I was traveling
when it took place and I just haven't had time to look at the
videotape,'' he said with a smile that suggests he is happy to have
an alibi for having no view.
</P>
<P>
   He also demurred when asked about the moment in the 1988
presidential debate when CNN's Bernard Shaw asked Michael Dukakis
how he would feel if someone raped and murdered his wife. ``I, uh,
I'm not going to answer that,'' he said. (Shaw is moderating this
year's vice presidential debate.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line for me,'' Lehrer said, picking his words
carefully, ``is we are now about to elect the single most important
and powerful person in the whole world. I am comfortable enough
with my skills to know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that I will not
abuse the power that I have by virtue of being the moderator of
these debates. I cannot conceive that, when all is said and done,
anybody will say the moderator was out of line or treated somebody
unfairly or did anything that was other than professional. I am
confident of that. I don't have to transform myself to be that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   A look back at the 1996 debates, which he also moderated _ or at
a PBS documentary, which aired Sunday, in which he questions
ex-presidents about memories of their own debates _ reveals
Lehrer's technique.
</P>
<P>
   He asks questions that are at once open-ended, focused, and,
perhaps above all else, short.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the thing,'' he said, lowering his voice to a whisper,
as if about to reveal a trade secret. ``The longer the question,
the easier it is to evade. I work hard to get the question down to
the point where if the candidate doesn't answer, everybody who's
watching says, `Hey, that som'bitch didn't answer the question.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer comes to his trade from modest roots. He was born in
Wichita, Kansas, and spent his childhood in several small towns
across the state before moving in his teen years to Texas. His
father, who never made it beyond the 8th grade, ran a failing bus
company. Lehrer himself worked as a Trailways ticket agent in
junior college. The walls of his office are covered with logos and
signs from long-defunct bus companies and terminals.
</P>
<P>
   He started collecting these figments in the 1970s, after his
father died. ``A friend of mine asked me why I collect all this,
and I said, `Well, it's part of my life,' '' Lehrer recalled. ``But
this person said, `No, no, no. What this is all about is that you
are saying, to yourself and anybody else who cares, that what your
father did mattered.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer paused and said, in a distant voice, ``Could be. Could
be.''
</P>
<P>
   After college and the Marine Corps, he went to what he calls
``the boot camp school of journalism,'' doing rewrites and
obituaries for the Dallas Morning News.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you write obits and you get something wrong, you get your
head handed to you in a way that is unlike anything else,'' he
said. ``I learned the hard way that you have to get it right. You
have to do everything you can to get it right. We hold people's
reputations and lives in our hands all the time. It's live
dynamite. And dammit, we ought to treat it like it's live
dynamite.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, when John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, his
editor gave Lehrer his first big chance: six months to look into
all the conspiracy theories that were floating around. He dug up
some intriguing bits but nothing that added up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept an open mind,'' he recalled. ``One theory after another
didn't check out, but I thought maybe one day, some theory will
prove to be correct, some hidden piece of evidence will be
discovered, somebody will come forward. But it never happened. I
now think time has run out on conspiracy-theory possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the experience may have shaped everything he has done
since. It let him plumb deeply into a story, a chance few reporters
get. It also gave him a benign _ or at least a non-malignant _ view
of authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a lot of time with law-enforcement people and
investigators who, with a couple of minor exceptions, were
exemplary people trying to find out the facts,'' he said. ``They
were not a bunch of idiots. They were not a bunch of conspiracy
people. They had open minds and they were working their butts off.
They were as upset as anybody else was that the President of the
United States had been assassinated.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer moved to TV by sheer accident. In 1970, while working as
city editor for the Dallas Times Herald, he wrote a novel, ``Viva
Max!'' It was turned into a movie starring Peter Ustinov. The deal
made him $45,000, big money back then, so he quit to write fiction
full time.
</P>
<P>
   By chance, the Dallas public TV station offered him a
two-day-a-week job as a consultant, which he took for some easy
extra money. Around this time, a San Francisco public TV station
aired a show that featured local newspaper reporters talking about
current events. Lehrer and his station manager went out to take a
look. It seemed like fun. They started a similar show in Dallas,
and Lehrer was hired to host it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, I was on television five nights a week without ever
making a decision about it,'' he said. In 1972, he went national
and moved to Washington, where he and his wife, the novelist Kate
Lehrer, have lived since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years,'' he said, ``I have wrung out of this
operation all the false pressure, all the false stress. By that, I
mean worrying about ratings or `Do we have a jazzy beginning
tonight?' or 'What do the other guys have?' ''
</P>
<P>
   His personal pace seems equally unstressed. He gets up at 6
a.m., comes to the office by 8, spends an hour or so working on a
novel (he has just published his 13th). Around 1 p.m., after a few
hours of toiling on the day's show, he takes a nap before resuming,
so he has enough energy to return to his novel at home later that
night if he wants.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the Boston debate just over a week away, Lehrer has
put aside his new novel for a while to prepare. ``I'm just working
my ass off,'' he said. ``I'm thinking all the time, going back over
things, refreshing my memory very precisely about what they've
said, what their positions are, figuring out a way to make it work
for the audience. I'm nowhere near ready, but I'm getting there.''

FARROW TELLS HER SON'S TALE

 (Sidebar to Polio-Battle)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the actress Mia Farrow speaks this week at a
United Nations summit aimed at eradicating polio, she will bring a
guest star: her adopted son, Thaddeus.
</P>
<P>
   Thaddeus, 11, is a paraplegic as a result of the virus. Farrow
adopted him almost six years ago from an orphanage in Calcutta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a very big point to have him there,'' Farrow said by
telephone from her home in Bridgewater, Conn. ``In this country, we
don't see polio anymore. It's very abstract for people in America
that children are still contracting this disease, and how difficult
it is for these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrow is a UNICEF spokeswoman on polio eradication. She is not
a typical celebrity promoter of a cause.
</P>
<P>
   Farrow is a polio survivor herself, having contracted the
disease at age 9. When she speaks about her experience, even
hardened global health specialists find themselves moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard her speak about how she spent three days in an iron
lung, and everyone in the room had tears in their eyes,'' said Jane
R. Zucker, a UNICEF polio eradication coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Iron lungs look like space capsules, and they filled US
hospitals in the 1940s and 1950s, the time of polio epidemics here.
The long metal tubes were life-support systems for those whose
chest muscles had become paralyzed by the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those three days were the worst, I think, of the whole
experience,'' Farrow said. ``I was taken away from my parents. They
couldn't visit me. It wasn't just kids in the iron lungs, it was
older people there, men gasping. I remember there were people taken
out of the wards in the middle of the night and never seeing them
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Her polio symptoms now are relatively minor. Her back is sore at
times. Thaddeus, though, is braced from his waist to his shoes. He
buckles himself into a wheelchair every morning. His paralysis
doesn't stop him from one of his loves, baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He plays on a team. He hits really well. He sits in his chair
in the outfield,'' Farrow said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time he threw himself out of his chair to make a catch.
Everyone cheered. That was nice. He does the best he can.''
</P>
<P>
   Both plan to address the UN polio summit Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of us,'' she said, ``want to see an end to this.''

<P>
   Although New York state voters will not cast ballots in the
Senate race for another six weeks, the election may have been
decided two weeks ago, with the first debate between First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton and US Representative Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Many political analysts thought Lazio's aggressive style toward
Clinton helped define him as a viable contender. They further
suggested that Clinton's efforts to tie Lazio to former House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, particularly in their voting records, simply
would not work in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts thought Lazio was too aggressive, even for New
York tastes. By walking up to Clinton's lectern and pressing her to
sign a pledge not to take ``soft money'' campaign contributions,
they said, he went too far.
</P>
<P>
   Polls taken soon after the debate suggest this second judgment
was the one held by most viewers. A New York Daily News/WCBS tally
showed that of 274 registered voters who watched the debate, 49
percent said Clinton did better, while 36 percent said Lazio did.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Lazio has continued his aggressive style, apparently
believing that this is what New Yorkers want. But he's not getting
that message from voters. Polls taken late last week clearly showed
_ again _ that Lazio's aggressiveness is not working.
</P>
<P>
   Although a poll by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion found
the race to be very tight _ a statistical tie at 48-44 percent,
given the margin of error _ a larger New York Times/CBS News poll
released Wednesday gave Clinton a 48 to 39 percent lead over Lazio.
A reason for Clinton's surge in this poll is that 56 percent of the
women found Lazio too aggressive, as did 53 percent of the men
polled.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, more voters in New York, according to the poll, saw
Lazio as spending more time attacking Clinton than dealing with
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Try as he might, Lazio is not going to make ``soft money'' a
priority in this campaign. Parties may indeed be using it in
inappropriate ways (such as to help a specific candidate, rather
than for the more general party-building and issue-development it
was intended for), but New York voters are not up in arms about it.
</P>
<P>
   It is apparent that Lazio has to change his style _ and even
though he has a chance to do that in the next debate, he may well
find that many voters already have made up their minds based on the
first debate, which is usually the one most-watched.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP has been counting on Clinton's relatively high
unfavorability rating, which has been hovering around 42 percent.
But that rating remained fairly consistent before and after the
debate, while Lazio's has climbed from 32 to 38 percent since the
debate, according to the Marist poll. If that trend continues, this
will be Clinton's race to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, anything can happen in the final six weeks of a
campaign, especially one as volatile as a New York Senate race. The
first lady _ who is not as popular as her husband _ is often viewed
as shrewd enough not to make any big blunders. Not even her
staunchest critics believe she would make a fatal mistake in these
remaining weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But the national Republican Party, as well as the New York GOP,
is not likely to throw in the towel at this stage. The stakes are
too high. The outcome will, after all, help determine whether the
GOP retains control of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The once-unlikely scenario of control of the Senate returning to
the Democrats has now become more possible, largely because of the
president's popularity and the GOP's negative attacks on him,
particularly the impeachment proceedings. A GOP loss of five seats
would return the majority to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans therefore see the New York race as important to
their efforts to retain control, even though the seat in question
has long been held by a Democrat, the retiring Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, and even though Vice President Al Gore is expected to
take New York in the presidential balloting.
</P>
<P>
   If this race thus far has proved anything, it is that being
raised in New York, as was Lazio, does not guarantee a strong
advantage over a candidate who has recently moved to New York, as
did Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   If the polls continue to show Clinton ahead right up to election
day, it will confirm that what New York voters care most about is
which candidate can do more for them in the Senate. That's
apparently how voters felt in 1964 when Robert F. Kennedy moved to
New York and won his Senate race against Republican Senator Kenneth
Keating.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP may need an October surprise to change the political
landscape in New York. But the party must be careful not to have
any such surprise come across as too negative or too aggressive.
Lazio has already proved that it doesn't work.

MIDLER MAKES THE SITCOM HER OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Treading gingerly on the minefield that is a
celebrity's ego, the questioner inquired whether Bette Midler had
decided to do a TV sitcom because she'd grown, um, unhappy with the
film offers she'd been getting.
</P>
<P>
   Midler, being Midler, cheerfully cut to the chase. ``I think
what you were saying was: Why am I going into television and what
happened to my movie career?'' she said, laughing hard.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, the Divine Miss M is that rare diva who's comfortable
making fun of herself. She'll have to be, because she's starring in
a new CBS sitcom, ``Bette,'' premiering Oct. 11 on WBZ-TV (Ch. 4)
that is structured to spoof both her persona and her life as a wife
and the mother of a 13-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm basically playing myself, so I'm hoping I won't be too far
off the mark,'' cracked Midler. ``It takes a little bit of a
stretch to play myself, but it's the role I'm most comfortable
with.''
</P>
<P>
   She has played that role in movies, recordings, concerts, and
stage productions. Now, the larger-than-life Midler is making her
first foray into regular series television at a time when the
medium is (thanks to the proliferation of ensemble dramas and
comedies) populated with smaller-than-life stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never done this before,'' Midler said. ``I find it a very
exciting medium because I love the fact that it's so fast, that you
don't . . . languish in development like you do in films, year
after year. I like the idea that you shoot it and it's on the next
week. It's out there. They either like it or they hate it.''
</P>
<P>
   So which of those reactions has her family had as they watch
thinly veiled versions of themselves onscreen? They like it, Midler
insisted, even though one scene in the pilot depicts her husband
falling asleep just before the couple is to make love. ``He said,
`That's right, I recognize it, that's very true to life,' '' Midler
reported.
</P>
<P>
   She promises a sitcom that draws on the ``very funny things that
have happened to me'' in her 30-year show-biz career, that takes
some risks, and that is not afraid to show its teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I would like to avoid is anything saccharine,
anything overly sentimental,'' Midler told TV critics in an
appearance by satellite in July. ``I'd like it to be a little
drier. And I like the idea of physical comedy a lot because that's
something that I do. I also like the idea of using music from week
to week, because I think that's something different that I can
bring that most people don't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Seems like a tall order, but to hear Midler tell it, carrying
the full weight of her own series will involve less pressure than
the cameo appearances she's made on other shows. ``I'd have these
cameo parts and they're very, very stressful because you're thrown
into a situation where you don't really understand the dynamics of
the group that's been there together for a year or two years or
five or 10 years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the first time I had actually done a full 22 minutes
of material that was tailored just to me,'' she added. ``And I
found it was just like guerrilla theater. It was so exciting
because these people keep feeding you lines and business and all
that sort of thing even after the audience has gone home.''
</P>
<P>
   Midler says she passed on a number of other sitcom proposals _
``a divorced mother with a child struggling, a woman whose husband
runs out on her and leaves her holding the bag . . . a very sort of
typical thing'' _ before saying yes to ``Bette'' creator Jeffrey
Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Lane says he built the sitcom around Midler because ``I couldn't
think of a character better than the one Bette's been playing for
all the years that we've known her, onstage and off. . . . I
couldn't create something better than she's created for herself.
That made it easy.''
</P>
<P>
   As she moves into TV, Midler's outsize persona has already
evoked comparisons to Lucille Ball _ comparisons that fluster the
normally unflappable star. ``I would never ever make that
comparison in a million years,'' Midler exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I adored her. I worshiped her and I was fortunate enough to
meet here and spend a little time with her and express to her how
much she meant to me. I really do believe that (`I Love Lucy')
stands head and shoulders above almost everything that's ever been
on television, as far as sitcoms are concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Midler's show-biz friends are expected to make cameo
appearances on ``Bette.'' Danny DeVito is featured in the pilot,
and Dolly Parton has agreed to make an appearance in an upcoming
episode. ``I think those people are always going to have to be
playing themselves if we are playing the reality, or whatever level
of reality this is, of Bette Midler living in Hollywood,'' said
Lane.
</P>
<P>
   There is another, colder Hollywood reality that the 54-year-old
Midler seems aware of: the grim fate that befalls older actresses.
She insisted she is moving to TV primarily so she can avoid lengthy
concert tours and spend more time with her daughter, but admitted:
``I cannot say that I wasn't affected by the fact that most of the
women that I came up with don't really have the kind of (film
acting) jobs that they once had. That thought has definitely
crossed my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   But then the brassy, give-em-hell Midler spirit resurfaced, as
she bluntly described what she won't miss about films: ``The
development for 15 years, and they you have to wait for the
25-year-old to give you the green light. I mean, forget it. Forget
it. Life is too short.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what,'' Bette Midler said. ``When they learn how
to make movies, I'll be back.''

JOSEPH H. LEWIS'S GREATEST MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Other people, so I have read, treasure memorable moments in
their lives,'' Walker Percy famously wrote in his novel ``The
Moviegoer.'' ``What I remember is the time John Wayne killed three
men with a carbine as he was falling to the dusty street in
`Stagecoach,' and the time the kitten found Orson Welles in the
doorway in `The Third Man.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen forty-nine was a good year for memorable movie moments.
It was the year of ``The Third Man'' (which, besides Welles and
that kitten, also boasts Welles and the Ferris wheel and Welles and
the Vienna sewers). It was the year of ``White Heat'' and James
Cagney's self-immolation to end all self-immolations, ``Made it,
Ma! Top of the world!'' It was also the year of ``She Wore a Yellow
Ribbon'' and one of the most beautiful tableaux in John Ford's
filmography: the 7th Cavalry trudging through the rain, with
Wayne's Capt. Nathan Brittles at their head.
</P>
<P>
   Great as those movie moments are, what may be the most memorable
shot of 1949 has nothing to do with anything so exalted as a script
by the likes of Graham Greene (who wrote ``The Third Man'') or a
star of the magnitude of Cagney or a master of the medium like
Ford. Rather, it occurs in Joseph H. Lewis's ``Gun Crazy,'' a
B-movie shoot-em-up of ``fascinating crumminess'' (as Pauline Kael
puts it) starring names no bigger than John Dall and Peggy Cummins.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who died last month at 93, was bringing pulp fiction to
the screen half a century before Quentin Tarantino _ and with
nowhere near the praise or profit, making more than three dozen
low-budget action movies with titles like ``Bombs Over Burma'' and
`Retreat, Hell!'' in the years between 1937 and 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Probably his best-known picture, after ``Gun Crazy,'' is ``The
Big Combo,'' a 1955 noir starring Cornel Wilde and Richard Conte.
In that movie, Conte, a Mob kingpin, struts around announcing,
``First is first _ and second is nobody.'' It was a line Lewis
surely took a grim satisfaction in hearing. During his heyday, he
was considered a Hollywood nobody: his very considerable talent for
action and urgency being taken for granted, when not actually
looked down on. But over the past four decades that talent has made
him a cult figure _ a lesser Samuel Fuller, a more varied Budd
Boetticher _ whose admirers include the critic Andrew Sarris and
the directors Martin Scorsese and Peter Bogdanovich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gun Crazy'' is his masterpiece, a crazy-quilt of period
moviemaking cliches (shots of newspaper front pages and chattering
teletype machines are used to advance the plot) and unnerving
Freudianism (Cummins and Dall are less a couple than a menage a
trois, with their pistols as third party) that, far more to the
point, offers a textbook display of dazzingly skilled direction.
</P>
<P>
   The epitome of that direction, and one of the more thrilling
shots in movie history, occurs halfway into the picture. Dall's
Bart Tare and Cummins's Annie Laurie Starr (they really did give
movie characters names like that) have embarked on a life of crime.
We've seen a montage of several small stick-ups, and Cummins has
just commandeered a car at gunpoint. They're about to do their
first bank job.
</P>
<P>
   The camera is positioned in the back seat of the car. For the
next 3 minutes and 30 seconds it never leaves. We see Dall and
Cummins from behind as they drive into a small town. She's behind
the wheel. He's nervously smoking and giving instructions. They
speak in monosyllables. Their dialogue sometimes overlaps. There's
no music. Everything feels as though it's just happening, being
made up on the spot: not so much improvisation as documentation. As
Scorsese and the screenwriter Jay Cocks have written of the scene,
``There's no more audience. There are only accomplices.''
</P>
<P>
   Cummins parks by the bank, and Dall gets out. Now comes Lewis's
masterstroke: There's no cut. The camera stays right where it is.
The action is going on inside, with Dall; but the tension is out
here, with Cummins. That tension builds and builds _ and then
increases when a cop wanders around the corner and plants himself
in front of the bank. Still there's no cut. Cummins gets out of the
car to distract him. The camera turns to follow her, but remains in
the car. Dall rushes out the door, an alarm goes off, Cummins conks
the cop over the head with a pistol butt.
</P>
<P>
   Now, finally, there's music _ but no cut. As the car screeches
off, the viewer's point of view remains from the back seat. The car
swerves and picks up speed. Cummins and Dall bicker. Desperation
wars with exhilaration as the robbers make good their escape.
Finally, there's a cut, to a close-up of a police dispatcher
calling out an all-points bulletin. We're back in standard
moviemaking territory _ and desperation can give way completely to
exhilaration: the exhilaration of storytelling at its freshest,
most proficient, and startlingly economical.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's unfair to speak of such a scene as a ``moment,''
since how many moments last for 3 1/2 minutes? Wayne with carbine
or Welles with kitten fills the screen for mere seconds. The view
through Cummins and Dall's windshield does so a hundred times
longer. But remember that, for Percy's moviegoer, a moment is
something indelibly retained in memory. So understood, Lewis's
scene more than qualifies.

RICHARDS ABOUT TO FIND OUT IF CAREER STILL FLYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, CALIF. _ Is there life after ``Seinfeld''?
</P>
<P>
   Some viewers, surveying the mostly feeble comedies that remain
since Jerry and the gang left prime time in 1998, may have glumly
concluded that no, there is not. But is there life after
``Seinfeld'' for the show's cast? Michael Richards is about to find
out.
</P>
<P>
   For nine seasons, Richards played Kramer, a human pinball who
was perpetually careening through Jerry Seinfeld's apartment door
when he wasn't concocting loony get-rich-quick schemes with Newman
the mailman. Kramer became a cult figure on one of the most
successful sitcoms of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 52-year-old Richards is bringing his mobile features
and his gift for slapstick to a new NBC sitcom titled ``The Michael
Richards Show,'' which premieres Oct. 24 on WHDH-TV (Ch. 7). He
will play Vic Nardozza, a disguise-wearing private investigator who
specializes in undercover work, and whom Richards describes as ``an
American Inspector Clouseau.''
</P>
<P>
   Clouseau, not Kramer: Like most actors, Richards seems leery of
being typecast. He says NBC was ``wide open to a new invention''
that's not a mirror image of his most famous creation. ``They
didn't say `Yeah, yeah, yeah, OK, we like the concept. Now, are you
going to have your hair up? How are you going to come through the
door?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Richards is entirely leaving ``Seinfeld'' _ or Seinfeld
_ behind. For one thing, the team that assembled his new show
consists of three former ``Seinfeld'' writers, including Spike
Feresten, author of the legendary ``Soup Nazi'' episode. For
another, Richards has already reached out to Seinfeld for advice on
building a better sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   ``He flew in, and we sat around for an afternoon together,''
said Richards. ``And he had a few line suggestions, and then said,
`Well, there you go,' and that was it, he was off.'' Because
Richards will be an executive producer as well as the star of the
series, he also tapped Seinfeld's knowledge of the ``logistics'' of
the former role.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest logistical challenge may be in getting viewers to
accept Richards in a non-Kramer role. Co-creator Gregg Kavet
touched on the conundrum the ``Michael Richards'' team faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're dealing with Kramer, probably one of the best-loved
characters ever on television,'' said Kavet. ``And it's something
where everyone is expecting to see that, but they're also reluctant
to see the exact same thing again. So what we've tried to do is
basically figure out ways to exploit Michael's strengths, . . .
continue to use things like physical comedy and the disguises,
certain characteristics that came up with Kramer, without having
the same type of person.''
</P>
<P>
   Offscreen, there seems to be little of Kramer in Richards. The
actor's speaking style is deliberate, even ponderous, a far cry
from Kramer's extraterrestrial outbursts. Richards referred to
himself several times as an ``artist,'' and lapsed frequently into
performers' jargon. But his love of his craft, especially physical
comedy, comes through when he discusses some of his comic heroes,
the likes of Ernie Kovacs, Peter Sellers, Charles Chaplin, and
Jacques Tati.
</P>
<P>
   By July, when Richards spoke to TV critics gathered here, ``The
Michael Richards Show'' was the subject of much speculation because
NBC executives, after seeing the pilot and concluding that the show
relied too heavily on Richards, asked for a complete overhaul of
the show. The sitcom's team did so, principally by fleshing out the
supporting cast around Richards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no trouble here,'' Richards insisted.
</P>
<P>
   He did emphasize, though, his hopes that the show will develop
the kind of ensemble strength that became a hallmark of
``Seinfeld.'' Toward that end, Tim Meadows (``Saturday Night
Live'') and William Devane (``Knot's Landing,'' ``Turks'') were
added to the cast as, respectively, an associate of Nardozza's with
a Peeping Tom fetish and the owner of the investigative agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like it's all hinged on me,'' said Richards. ``I
have a driving style, and certainly (some of the) capers will
circulate around the character that I'll be playing. But I feel
that this is going to be an ensemble-driven show.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Richards and Meadow are the professional comedians and
Devane is known for a glowering intensity in film and TV dramas, it
was Devane who showed a deadpan, even Seinfeldian, touch when he
explained how he got his role. ``They were looking for an older
guy, and I'm an older guy,'' he said dryly. ``So that all kind of
worked out.''

DENZEL WASHINGTON'S NEW ARENA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Boxing was the handle when Denzel Washington immersed
himself in the role of Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter in ``The
Hurricane.'' To convince as a boxer from the opening bell and the
opening frame, Washington trained for two years. For his new film,
``Remember the Titans,'' opening Friday, Washington set himself a
less physically arduous but more elusive task. To play Herman
Boone, the first black coach of an integrated high school football
team in Virginia in 1971, Washington had to channel Vince Lombardi.
</P>
<P>
   What made him want to take on the role, Washington says,
unwinding after a day of interviews in an East Side hotel suite,
was going to Alexandria, where the retired coach lives with his
wife, and spending time with him. ``After `The Hurricane,' I wasn't
really interested in playing another real-life person,'' Washington
says. ``But I got hooked by him, by his passion. His wife said,
`You're seeing a third of what it used to be. He's real mellow
now.' He was angry. He did things his way. He didn't care. And very
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is based on the true story of a team formed by
Virginia's then new and far from universally popular integration
laws. Boone's first task, before he could even think of molding a
football team, was to break down the barriers between black and
white players who weren't used to being in the same building
together, much less the same locker room. As heroic as Boone was
Bill Yoast, the beloved white coach he replaced, but who stayed on
to assist. (Will Patton has the role of Yoast.) Boone was a
volatile man in a volatile place at a volatile time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone I spoke to said nobody worked harder than Coach Boone
did,'' Washington says. ``He has a strong opinion about everything.
And he stepped on a lot of toes as a result of that. But he had a
lot of success as well. He said also that if he was coaching today,
he'd be arrested. He was just like Lombardi. You know, `Winning is
not everything _ it's the only thing.' He really had that sort of
attitude. And he would defend winning. He said, `Oh, everybody's
talking about how it's the way you play the game and if we can just
get along.' Coach Boone says, `Naw, not me. I wanna win.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He says, `I like the idea of it, that's what I'm working so
hard to do. That's what I want my players to feel. I want to crush
the opposition.' I wrote down a lot of the phrases I heard him say.
I use them in the film. He said, `When I die, I want them to play
Frank Sinatra's `My Way' at the funeral the whole day. I put it in
my will.' I was, like, `Is he kidding?' His wife says, `No, he does
have it in his will.' I mean, what kinda guy is that? That's what
excited me.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's, like, `I'm a winner. I wanna win all the time.' And I'm,
like, OK. And am I like that? And I find a part of me saying yeah.
What's wrong with feeling that way? You know, you can be, like,
politically correct, whatever. But that's not who he is. I think he
has mellowed quite a bit. But in those days I can only imagine his
intensity. To play him, I just tapped into what I already have. I'm
a pretty competitive person. I just had to really realize, OK,
we're very similar. I'm competitive and I let it be OK to show.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington smiles when it's suggested that he let it show during
the last Oscar derby, when he momentarily cleared the air by
declaring, after being nominated for ``The Hurricane,'' that he
hoped he would win. ``Yeah, the whole, you know, `to be nominated
is good enough' _ '' He leaves the sentence unfinished. ``Maybe
there was a residue of coach Boone in me at the time. I felt, `Naw,
I wanna win. Forget that stuff about it's nice to be one of the
five. Forget that. That's nonsense. I wanna win.' When it came time
to open the envelope, though, I had no feeling. I knew I wasn't
gonna win. I just didn't feel that they were gonna give it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years ago Washington won a supporting-actor Oscar for
playing a defiant ex-slave who fought in the Union army in
``Glory.'' Like Rubin Carter, who turned to boxing, and Boone, who
knew all too well that the deck was stacked against him and that he
would be fired if he had a losing season, that role simmered with
anger. Does Washington, though a fixture on the Hollywood A-list,
tap into a permanent reservoir of personal anger as an
African-American?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an anger still in me, tied, I think, to frustrations.
But I'm able to express them in film and then find out, after
acting the frustration of a given character, that, oh, I feel this
way, too. When you're not forced into these situations, like the
one he's forced into in this film, you don't tap into that
reservoir because you've sort of put it on a back burner, or you
maybe forgot that it exists. You know, I don't have to walk around
thinking about race relations in 1971. But as the character, I do.
And how I feel about it begins to come out, and there's something
about it that might make me feel angry, and I can use that in a
scene in the film.''
</P>
<P>
   It's fair to say that life has eased for Washington. Back when
we spoke before the release of ``Glory,'' he recounted his
difficulty in getting a taxi to take him uptown to Harlem, where
his mother lived. These days, he's gotten out of the
trying-to-catch-a-taxi business. He has a driver, an old
acquaintance he helped to establish a limo service. Yet in the
film, Washington is never out of touch with the impulses of the
type-A hero he plays.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that gives the role complexity is the fact that
Washington's family has Southern roots. He spent time there growing
up. His father grew up 40 miles from Alexandria. He would send his
children each summer to their relatives in North Carolina, pleased
to note that they'd come back saying, `Yes, ma'am' and `No, ma'am.'
Washington went to high school in Florida _ where, he says, they
take their football even more seriously than folks do in Virginia.
Although Washington was born in Mount Vernon, outside New York
City, he says, ``I wasn't just a Yankee going down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington jokes that while he underwent arduous physical
conditioning for ``The Hurricane,'' he mostly just blows a whistle
in ``Remember the Titans.'' ``I didn't have to get in any kind of
physical condition for this film. I did a little bit of running,
but I was the coach. The players were going to do all the work.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Washington says, ``I practiced blowing the whistle,''
he isn't just being flippant. The whistle, and the frequency and
stridency with which he blows it, is the key to the coach, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whistle was my handle for coach Boone,'' Washington says.
``That and the winning attitude. You know, it was more about what's
going on between my ears than the sense of survival I needed to
feel with Rubin. What I had to learn as coach Boone was patience,
patience with those around me. I didn't wait for those kids to
develop. I just snatched them up and brought them along with me.
Because I came to win, you know? I got it from him. I put it in the
computer'' _ he points to his temple _ ``I put it in the heart, and
I was rollin' with it. And for those who weren't ready, weren't
prepared, I didn't have a lot of tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 46 Washington does have more tolerance. ``My lifestyle
has become simpler, you know? I've got less and less clothes that I
wear. I wear the same ones more and more. I like my Casio G Shock
watch. I'm pretty simple and I understand what I do and what's
important, you know, raising my kids and what my profession is and
working hard at it. I understand my relationship with the audience
and my responsibility. I keep it simple. My life is not that
complicated now.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington and his wife, Paulette, have four children, a son, a
daughter, and twins (boy and girl). He and Paulette met in 1977,
when they acted in his debut TV film, ``Wilma,'' about Olympic
runner Wilma Rudolph. They married in 1983, renewed their vows in
1995 in South Africa with Bishop Desmond Tutu officiating. Their
older son, John David, played a student in a Harlem classroom in
``Malcolm X,'' one of the films Washingtion says he'd include in
his clip reel if he were faced with the choice of compiling one.
Others? ``This one for sure, `Glory' for sure, `Malcolm X,'
`Mississippi Masala,' `Devil in a Blue Dress.' '' Mira Nair's
``Mississipi Masala,'' one of his lesser-known films, is a
frequently comic love story in which he falls for the daughter of
an Indian immigrant family, and she for him. He'd do another love
story in a minute, he says. He just hasn't found a script he likes
enough.
</P>
<P>
   He's produced a TV documentary about the great photographer and
cinematographer Gordon Parks. He's making his directing debut in
another TV documentary, about Antwone Fisher, a former security
guard on the Sony lot before he sold his autobiographical script
about a man coming to terms with a violent criminal past after
being sent to a Navy psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he feels boxed in by audience expectations _ the Sidney
Poitier syndrome _ Washington smiles again and replies: ``We'll
find out about a year or so from now because I'm going to play a
very dirty undercover cop who's a drug dealer and a murderer. The
film _ `Training Days' _ is not based on a true story, but he's
kinda funky, so we'll see if the audience wants to see me in that
role. To me, the message of the film is that the wages of sin are
death. He catches quite a few bullets in the end!''

PBS FOCUSES ON HISTORY, MONEY, POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What do Napoleon, Norman Mailer, Clint Eastwood, and the
Rockefellers have in common? Money, megalomania, political careers?
Actually, all of the above, in varying degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The correct answer, though, is that all of them are subjects of
promising-sounding PBS programs during this TV season.
</P>
<P>
   Napoleon Bonaparte _ the self-made, almost unimaginably
powerful, and rather peculiar French emperor _ deservedly gets the
longest show. (Mailer might disagree.) In the first hour of the
four-hour documentary, ``Napoleon'' (beginning Nov. 8), the
ambitious soldier-leader falls crazily in love with Josephine, who
finds him physically repellent _ but then, she possesses political
ambitions and gifts of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers can hope that Hollywood icon and multitalent Clint
Eastwood will receive something tougher on PBS than the star
treatment he's grown accustomed to. Eastwood's fascinating but
fallible, and perhaps the ``American Masters'' program, tentatively
titled ``Clint Eastwood'' (Wednesday), will profile him critically,
in the best sense of that word.
</P>
<P>
   No one resists categorization as readily as the shape-shifting
author and self-styled Great American oracle Norman Mailer, the
subject of what PBS is calling an ``American Masters Special.'' I,
for one, can't wait to see how the 90-minute ``Norman Mailer''
(Oct. 4) addresses his prolific and often thrillingly brilliant
career and episodic private and public life.
</P>
<P>
   The WGBH-produced ``American Experience'' history series rarely
disappoints, and there is no reason to expect less than a sterling
effort when the season begins with the multigenerational ``The
Rockefellers'' (Oct. 16).
</P>
<P>
   Following are some other upcoming programs that seem worth
penciling into your daybook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building Big'' is a five-part miniseries (beginning Oct. 3)
developed in collaboration with author-illustrator David Macaulay.
He's the creator of dramatic, handsome, large-format books
explaining, among other things, how cathedrals and Roman cities
were planned and built. In the television series, he explores the
structure of bridges, skyscapers, dams, tunnels, and domes.
</P>
<P>
   The fine, chameleonic British actor Derek Jacobi stars in this
season's first ``Mystery!'' called ``The Wyvern Mystery''
(beginning Oct. 12). On this basis alone, the Gothic horror yarn
calls for a visit.
</P>
<P>
   The new PBS series, ``ExxonMobil Masterpiece Theatre's American
Collection,'' might distinguish itself despite the bulky, ugly
title. The premiere program, ``Cora Unashamed'' (Oct. 25), sounds
like a possible winner. It's a two-hour dramatic adaptation of the
short story by poet Langston Hughes, and co-stars Regina Taylor and
Cherry Jones (the wonderful former member of Cambridge's ART
repertory company). As for the un-American collection,
``Masterpiece Theatre'' kicks off its 30th anniversary season with
``Oliver Twist'' Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matisse &AMP; Picasso'' (Nov. 15) is an illuminating account of
artistic borrowing, quarreling, affection, and interdependence of
the two giants of modern painting.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'm eagerly awaiting ``On Cukor'' (Nov. 22), another
``American Masters Special,'' this one devoted to the career and
life of stylish American film director George Cukor. Was anyone a
more inspired director of American actresses _ Hepburn, Judy
Holliday, Greta Garbo, for prime examples.
</P>
<P>
   Also stay tuned for two World War II-era nonfiction films:
``Daring to Resist,'' an account of three young women who resisted
the Nazis; and ``Invisible Soldiers: Unheard Voices'' (Nov. 21),
based on experiences of African-Americans in uniform during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frontline,'' the investigative series now in its 19th season,
almost always rewards your attention, as does ``POV,'' the more
personal series of independently produced nonfiction films.
</P>
<P>
   It's a little early to make dates for next year, but an
exception ought to be made for master documentarian Ken
(``Baseball,'' ``The Civil War'') Burns. Beginning Jan. 8, his
10-part ``Jazz'' series airs on PBS. At the least, a feast for the
ear.

 &QL; 
!!! 1/2 ``The Exorcist'' The landmark film is still scary after all
these years. This rerelease has 11 restored minutes that add
spiritual context, but what made people flock to it in 1973, and
will again, is its satanic rock and roll, with priests trying to
perform an exorcism on Linda Blair's pea-soup-and-obscenity-spewing
preteen. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! ``The Fantasticks'' Earnest but essentially stillborn version of
the long-running stage musical about young lovers roughed up by a
hired scamster, the better to season their green, untested hearts.
Some of the wistfulness in the Tom Jones-Harvey Schmidt score
remains intact in the fresh-voiced singing of Jean Louisa Kelly and
Joe McIntyre, but realistic settings swamp this material that
depends on diminutiveness and artifice for its effects. (PG) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! ``God's Army'' A look at a 19-year-old's introduction to life as
a Mormon missionary, this independent film is most effective when
addressing universal questions of what it means to give your life
to faith. But in its zeal to overcome the general suspicion of
Mormons, it succumbs to over-earnestness and sentimentality. (PG)
(Loren King) ! 1/2 ``Urban Legends: The Final Cut'' Dumb campus
slasher movie that doesn't so much extend the original as recycle
it, with more attention paid to film-school legends than to the
urban variety. The real star here is the darkly lit neo-Stonehenge
architecture of the Canadian university where the film was shot.
(R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``Urbania'' An impressive attempt to film the disconnected life
of a troubled Manhattan single male trying to deal with loss and
emptiness. The film's fragmented style and raw street-flavored
urgency uses the legends to express urban anxiety. Dan Futterman
rolls impressively with the punches director Jon Shear dishes out
to his everyman. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``Solomon &AMP; Gaenor'' A handsomely crafted but familiar
Romeo-and-Juliet story, set in Wales in 1911. Ioan Gruffudd's
Solomon is Jewish, Nia Roberts's Gaenor is Welsh, and it doesn't
take much to see that a valley full of seething unemployed miners
is as capable of a pogrom as deadly as any in the Eastern European
shtetls and ghettos that Solomon's ancestors fled. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``The Tavern'' Walter Foote's debut film proves he can populate
the screen with involving characters, in this case a blue-collar
family trying for the brass ring when they buy and try to make a go
of a Greenwich Village bar. Cameron Dye is affecting as the brother
trying for respectability and paternal status. So is Kevin Geer as
his timid brother, bravely (for him) going out on a limb.
(Unrated) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``Woman on Top'' Fina Torres trains her camera on three of
the planet's most photogenic subjects _ Brazil, San Francisco, and
Penelope Cruz. Cruz plays a chef, wounded by her husband's
infidelity, fleeing to San Francisco, where she becomes the star of
a TV cooking show. Fanciful and delicate, as sketchy as it is
gossamer, but also diverting enough in its across-the-board
sensuality and Latin American colors, textures, music, and allure.

THE BIG FOUR HAVE LOTS PLANNED FOR YOU THIS FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT

<TEXT>
<P>
   Yes, Olympics oglers and ``Survivor'' obsessives, there is a
fall TV season this year. Of course, like everything else
tube-related these days, its lines have been blurred, its
boundaries redefined.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the networks unrolled new shows in
early-to-mid-September, still reveling in the glory and disgrace of
the Emmy Awards. As the country sharpened its collective pencil for
a massive step back to functionality, the networks gave us a few
dozen reasons to go back to the couch.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, with the summer games commandeering September for
the first time, the fall TV season won't stagger into our homes
until October and even, thanks to Fox's need to be special, early
November.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the delay, though, Variety reports that TV viewers are
unusually curious about the fall lineup. That's because this summer
the networks had hugely rated series like ``Survivor'' and ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' during which they promoted their
upcoming shows relentlessly. Turns out that, after being bombarded
with Miss M's rendition of Kid Rock's ``Bawitdaba'' in between
scenes of Richard Hatch's island villainy, many of us are now dying
to get a load of ``Bette.''
</P>
<P>
   But be careful: You will get what you wish for. And it won't be
as good as you may have hoped. Don't worry _ this is not a screed
about how this year's batch of fall shows has hit a new low, or a
warning to TV scripters to get their acts together in the face of
reality TV and the Regis fixation. It's just the introduction to a
season that is mostly mediocre, from Gabriel Byrne's disappointing
try at TV comedy to Andre Braugher's return in that tiredest of TV
genres, the hospital drama. There's nothing mind-bendingly bad this
year, no ``Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer,'' but then there's
nothing abundantly intelligent either, no ``West Wing,'' or
``Freaks &AMP; Geeks,'' or ``Once and Again,'' three of the finest from
last year's unusually good crop.
</P>
<P>
   The two most promising shows, ``Ed'' and ``That's Life,'' fall
into the dramedy category, that hybrid that David E. Kelley
pioneered in the 1990s. Neither one is strikingly original, but
each manages to invest its familiar theme with rich
characterizations and the sort of charm you might find in an
independent movie. ``Ed'' is a direct descendant of ``Providence''
and ``Judging Amy,'' only this time the character moving back home
after romantic disaster is a guy. NBC is taking a risk by
scheduling ``Ed,'' the series that has won the loudest advance
acclaim from critics, on Sundays opposite ``Touched By an Angel,''
``The Simpsons,'' and ``Malcolm in the Middle.'' But that risk is
nothing next to CBS's decision to slot ``That's Life'' on Saturdays
before ``Walker, Texas Ranger.'' Last year, NBC threw away the
exceptional ``Freaks &AMP; Geeks'' by sending it into that same ratings
Bermuda Triangle.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-profile series may be the trio of self-titled
sitcoms _ ``Bette,'' ``The Michael Richards Show,'' and ``The Geena
Davis Show.'' Sure, now they want us to remember their names, but
later, well, they may regret leading with their egos. NBC and Emmy
winner Richards continue to futz with ``The Michael Richards
Show,'' and so we are left with only a series of doggedly unfunny
TV promos with which to predict disaster. ``Bette'' and ``The Geena
Davis Show'' are both finished, however, and neither promises to
enthrall. The Davis vehicle, which has the Oscar-winning actress
playing a glamour girl in suburbia, is strikingly unoriginal, even
if she has a sweet presence. And the faux-autobiographical
``Bette'' is a trying half-hour, even for Midler fans. Let's just
say the divine diva is a little too big for TV.
</P>
<P>
   Like Midler and Davis, a few other movie actors are doing the
tube thing this season, including Ellen Burstyn, Paul Sorvino, and
Byrne. And, as usual, we've got notable TV actors doing the tube
thing all over again, from John Goodman, whose gay-Dad sitcom is
still unready for preview, to Victoria Principal and Delta Burke,
whose shows, unfortunately, are ready. We've got a pair of
``Wings'' alumni (Tim Daly in ``The Fugitive'' and Steven Weber in
``Cursed'') who might not be airborne very long, and a few other
sitcom graduates _ Christine Baranski, Katey Sagal, Bebe Neuwirth _
who stand a better chance.
</P>
<P>
   We've got a number of star TV producers introducing new projects
_ Dick Wolf of ``Law &AMP; Order'' has the energetic journalism drama
``Deadline''; David E. Kelley has the unfinished ``Boston Public'';
and Paul Attanasio of ``Homicide'' has the grave ``Gideon's
Crossing.'' And we've got the Star producer, Darren Star of ``Sex
and the City,'' delivering two new series, one soapy and satirical
(``Grosse Pointe''), the other soapy and topical (``The Street''),
both with potential. Oh, and schlock producer Aaron Spelling is
back, too, with ``Titans,'' a feeble attempt at instant camp. Spray
cheese, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Which fall 2000 series will improve as the season progresses?
And which will get plucked prematurely, victimized by the networks'
growing need for speedy successes? The critics will crow, and the
networks will sweat, but ultimately, the viewers will be the ones
with the remote control.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And what about the returning shows? Here are notes about some of
the changes due this season:
</P>
<P>
   David Duchovny becomes a part-timer as he phases out of ``The
X-Files'' (Nov. 5), appearing in only 11 episodes. Robert Patrick
joins the cast as a New York cop who teams up with Scully. . . .
Now that Bobby and Lindsay are married, ``The Practice'' (Oct. 8)
will develop romantic plotlines for Lara Flynn Boyle's Helen and
Lisa Gay Hamilton's Rebecca. Jason Kravits's Richard Bay becomes a
series regular.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Sheen is joining ``Spin City'' (Oct. 18) to fill the gap
left by Michael J. Fox's much-publicized departure. Also exiting
the show: Connie Britton (Nikki), Alexander Chaplin (James), and
Victoria Dillard (Janelle). . . . Another season of ``Law &AMP; Order''
(Oct. 18), another cast change. Steven Hill, the only actor left
from the first year, leaves, and Dianne Wiest comes onboard as the
new DA. . . . Ex-convict Robert Downey Jr. will have a recurring
role on ``Ally McBeal'' (Oct. 23). . . . Ice-T and Stephanie March
join the cast of ``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit'' (Oct. 20). .
. . As it did last season, ``Once and Again'' (Oct. 24) will air on
Tuesdays at 10 until January. Then ``NYPD Blue'' will take over the
slot and ``Once'' will move to Mondays at 10.
</P>
<P>
   The producers will say only that a life hangs in the balance
when ``The West Wing'' (Oct. 4) returns. Anna Deavere Smith joins
the cast as national security adviser. . . . On ``Will &AMP; Grace''
(Oct. 12), which is relocating to Thursdays at 9, Grace will move
back into Will's apartment, and Jack will move across the hall. . .
. With Julianna Margulies gone, ``ER'' (Oct. 12) will feature last
season's newcomer Maura Tierney more prominently this season. Sally
Field will guest in six episodes as her estranged mother. . . . And
Rob Estes, formerly of ``Melrose Place'' and ``Suddenly Susan,''
tries his luck on ``Providence'' (Oct. 20), as Syd's new love
interest.

A NEW LOOK AT THE QUEEN OF MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBIN W. WINKS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Very seldom does a critical work about detective fiction cause
one to rethink the fundamentals of the genre. There are a goodly
number of splendid biographies of mystery writers, living and dead,
and perhaps 50 good books that examine the philosophy, technique,
and attractions of detective, mystery, and spy fiction. There are
four or five histories of the mystery, though none of late. Agatha
Christie has received more attention than most practitioners, as
befits the Queen of Crime, and I had not expected to encounter much
that was new about her. But I was quite wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mystery Behind the Agatha Christie Mystery'' is the
subtitle to a compelling new study of Christie's best work, whose
title, ``Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?'', is the main title of this
remarkable book by Pierre Bayard (translated, from the French, by
Carol Cosman; New Press, $22.95). Short and engaging, Bayard's
reexamination of Christie's question was published first in 1980 in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Bayard, a psychoanalyst and professor of French literature,
reexamines Christie's classic _ in which (surely we all know) the
narrator proves to be the murderer _ on every ground: logic,
language, character, possibility, and alternatives. He concludes
that Hercule Poirot suffered from a delusion and that the narrator,
Dr. Sheppard, did not commit the murder; he fastens on a more
likely candidate, using Christie's own words, while giving
Sheppard's famous obfuscating statements a fresh interpretation; he
shows how the conventions of the genre led writer, reader, and
narrative along different paths; and by reminding us of the simple
fact that ``the first-person narrative does not tell a story;
rather, it offers a point of view on a story,'' he forces us to
rethink ``Roger Ackroyd,'' mystery fiction broadly, the narrative
mode specifically, and even how history (which I teach) is written.
A relatively long excursion into ``Oedipus Rex'' proves valuable,
and Bayard wears his analyst's learning lightly enough to keep us
with him admiringly to the end. This is the most entertaining _ and
enlightening _ nonfiction contribution to the field I have read all
year, and despite some quite odd errors concerning Christie's ``Ten
Little Indians,'' it provides exactly what the jacket copy
promises: ``An exciting exploration of a book we think we know, the
conventions of the mystery novel, and the act of reading itself.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reading Ron Faust's ``Lord of the Dark Lake'' (Forge, $13.95
paperback) immediately after Bayard makes one especially alert to
the way in which Faust misleads us while relling a terrific story.
Jay Chandler is an archeologist who is treated virtually as a
member of the family of a vastly rich Greek who invites him to a
weeklong party on an isolated island. Attendees are an odd lot,
carefully and often amusingly displayed to us by Faust. Then the
deaths begin. We are still in Christie land here, with a subtle and
complex replay of ``Ten Little Indians.'' The description of
Chandler and members of the party trapped in a cave is very well
done, and had I not just read Bayard, I might have accepted the
last page exactly as it is written. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Eidson plays no verbal tricks: He simply tells a good
story, convincingly and, in ``One Bad Thing'' (Forge, $24.95),
chillingly. In a hurry to find someone to help him sail his boat
back from Tortola to Boston, Rob McKenna doesn't check into the
credentials of his new mate, who is revealed to be smuggling
diamonds. McKenna does that one bad thing _ he lies to cover up the
smuggling _ and he is plunged into an unending whirlpool of deceit,
putting himself, his wife, and all his friends in mortal danger.
Eidson writes a tough, direct prose edged with irony, and he may
well be a successor, at last, to the much-missed John D.
MacDonald. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Laura Lippman also tells a good story, and ``The Sugar House''
(Morrow, $24) is compulsive yet thoughtful reading. Set in a
beautifully realized Baltimore, ``The Sugar House'' puts private
eye Tess Monaghan on to the case of a glue-sniffing odd bird who
kills a nameless teenage girl and who in turn is murdered in
prison. Finding out who the girl was is Monaghan's greatest
challenge, and along the way she meets a number of interesting
people. This is Lippman's fifth book, and she has already won the
Edgar, Anthony, Wecavity, Agatha, and Shamis awards _ what next,
the Nero Wolfe? This is her best book, funny, sad, compassionate,
and well written. Even Pierre Bayard would not challenge the way
Lippman tells us her tale.

   Computerized biometrics _ systems that read your body
measurements or patterns such as fingerprints, voiceprints, iris

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In 1989, I bought a voiceprint lock for $1,500 and had it
installed on the front door of my condominium. The device was the
size of a shoe box, with a keypad on the front and a four-digit red
LED readout.
 &HT;    To get into my house I would simply enter my code (9) and say my
password (``airplane''). A moment later, the door would unlock.
 &HT;    The system worked pretty well, but it wouldn't let me into my
house during a loud thunderstorm or, ironically, when an airplane
was passing overhead.
 &HT;    When I sold the condo, the new owners painted over the
voiceprint reader and installed a more familiar, keyhole lock.
 &HT;    A decade later, computerized biometrics _ systems that read your
body measurements or patterns such as fingerprints, voiceprints,
iris prints or facial features _ has finally come of age.
 &HT;    For example, the U.S. Army is building a huge biometric database
intended to simplify everything from salary payments to military
security. Banks are experimenting with iris scanners as a way to
replace ATM cards and numerical pass codes.
 &HT;    As a result, the $60 million commercial biometrics market is
expected to grow tenfold in the next three years.
 &HT;    Fingerprints, which are by far the best-established biometric
markers, have thoroughly proven their worth in the world of law
enforcement. More than a hundred years ago, police in Argentina
began recording fingerprints left at a crime scene to identify
suspects. The idea quickly spread.
 &HT;    Throughout the 20th century, U.S. police departments and the FBI
compiled ''10-print cards'' from suspects and lifted samples of
fingerprints from crime scenes.
 &HT;    But as these files grew larger and larger they became less and
less useful, because searching for a match was manual. By the
mid-1980s it would have taken a single worker more than 33 years to
search the U.S. Department of Justice's 300,000 fingerprint cards
for a match, according to a 1987 department report.
 &HT;    Computerized fingerprint systems fundamentally changed the
rules. As police departments scanned fingerprint cards and latent
prints from crime scenes into their computers, the computers
rapidly found matches and solved crimes that had been given up as
hopeless.
 &HT;    Now electronic fingerprinting is catching on in the office.
 &HT;    ``The biggest applications are the `log in' process,'' says
William H. Saito, president and CEO of I/O Software, a California
firm that sells software for fingerprint and face recognition
systems.
 &HT;    Instead of having employees remember dozens of passwords for
different computer systems, companies are using biometric systems
to implement ``single sign-on,'' Saito says.
 &HT;    A worker just sits down at the computer, presses a thumb against
a credit-card-sized scanner, and the system automatically unlocks
the files and applications that person is authorized to use.
 &HT;    ``Among the Fortune 1000 companies it is a no-brainer,'' Saito
says.
 &HT;    He also sees interest in biometrics spreading to small offices
and home-computer users.
 &HT;    ``We can prevent an application launch _ we won't let people
launch Quicken, for example, without a fingerprint,'' he says.
 &HT;    I/O's software can also control the Web browser, so that younger
family members can access only specific Web sites.
 &HT;    Eventually, fingerprints might also be used to finalize business
transactions _ tax payments or home refinancing, for instance _
conducted over the Internet.
 &HT;    President Clinton recently approved a bill that would make such
electronic signatures as legally binding as traditional ones in pen
and ink.
 &HT;    Sounds promising, but commercial biometrics has a history of
false starts. That's because the systems don't actually identify a
person; they merely compare a measurement of the human body with a
stored template.
 &HT;    If the measurement and the template are similar enough, the
comparing software declares the two a match.
 &HT;    Early systems sold in the 1980s didn't do very well on these
comparisons. They were subject to high numbers of false positives,
in which the system erroneously matched a person's measurement with
the wrong template, and false negatives, in which the computer
failed to identify a real match.
 &HT;    Today's systems are far more accurate, thanks to faster
computers, but they still make mistakes.
 &HT;    Voiceprint IDs haven't found widespread use largely because of
technical difficulties.
 &HT;    ``The inherent problem is that all microphones are not created
equal,'' Saito says. ``Ambient noise is another problem, especially
if you are outside on a tarmac, inside a client's office or in a
classroom full of kids.''
 &HT;    Or, in my case, standing in the rain, trying to get the
voiceprint lock to open between thunderclaps.
 &HT;    Striations in the eye's iris are a thousand times more
distinctive than the whorls on a finger, so in principle iris
prints should be even more reliable than fingerprints.
 &HT;    In 1995, the first iris scanners were successfully deployed to
provide security for prison doors and bank vaults, says Lou
Sassano, vice president of worldwide sales for IriScan, a New
Jersey company that holds patents on the technology.
 &HT;    Bank United of Texas recently set up three automatic teller
machines equipped with IriScan's technology in Dallas.
 &HT;    ``The recognition is so secure you do not have to use either
your ATM card or your PIN number,'' says Vern Stockton, a director
at Bank United.
 &HT;    Iris recognition adds approximately $5,000 to the overall
$15,000 to $35,000 cost of an ATM.
 &HT;    Late this year, IriScan will introduce a $200 camera for desktop
computers.
 &HT;    Part of the appeal of iris prints is that they require no
special action _ they can be read without a person's knowledge.
 &HT;    Facial recognition is prone to error but is even more stealthy.
Viisage Technology, a Massachusetts firm, has developed a system
that would allow police to scan a driver after they stop a vehicle.
Their approach, based on technology developed at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology Media Lab in the early 1990s, would use a
hidden camera on the officer's collar to photograph people in the
car. Then a pair of radios would transmit the image to the police
station, where a computer would run a comparison against a
face-recognition database and transmit an alert to the officer if
the driver were wanted or dangerous.
 &HT;    Another Viisage product, called Hunter, is designed to pick out
known terrorists from airport surveillance cameras. More than 50
casinos already use a similar system of hidden video cameras and
computers to identify known scam artists and cardsharps.
 &HT;    There are no laws in the United States to regulate the
collection or use of biometric information.
 &HT;    ``Biometrics is one of the most urgent privacy issues,'' says
Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center.
 &HT;    Biometric identifiers could replace Social Security numbers and
become a kind of ``informational flypaper,'' he says, so that
everything about you _ your product preferences, credit history,
youthful indiscretions _ sticks with you for life.
 &HT;    Someday you might feel a strange nostalgia for old-fashioned
signatures and ATM cards, not to mention locks and keys.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    A large organization works most efficiently when a job gets
divided up among specialists, each of whom does a limited set of
things exceptionally well.
 &HT;    The same holds true for the human nervous system. Such division
of labor is especially prominent in the eye, home to two highly
distinct networks of light processing neurons.
 &HT;    In one network, visual nerve cells activated by rod-shaped
receptors are exquisitely sensitive to dim light and motion, but
hopeless at resolving colors and small contours.
 &HT;    The other network, driven by receptors shaped like cones, is
very proficient at discerning colors and fine details, but
relatively inept at detecting faint light or subtle movement.
 &HT;    Despite their individual weaknesses, the rod and cone systems
make a great team, working together like two army scouts who've
agreed that one will scan the landscape for movement but hand off
to his partner the job of determining what it is that's moving.
 &HT;    We don't notice that we have two receptor systems because our
brains seamlessly combine their outputs. But with these tests you
can tease them apart.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    EXPERIMENT 1
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Compare the brightness of these two color patches. In strong
light, the red should look a little punchier. But if you turn down
the lights until the gap in the C above the colors is barely
discernible, the red should be the dimmer of the two hues.
 &HT;    That's because the cone system, which dominates vision in
daytime, responds well to red light, whereas the rod system, which
rules the night, can hardly see red at all.
 &HT;    This change in relative color brightness from day to night is
called the Purkinje shift, after Jan Evangelista Purkinje, the
Czech scientist who first described it.
 &HT;    The proportion of rods to cones is greater away from the center
of the retina where you fix your gaze, so the red splotch will look
even darker if you move it into rod territory by staring at the C
instead of directly at the colors.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    EXPERIMENT 2
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Make an artificial star by taping a piece of cardboard over the
lens of a flashlight and then pricking a tiny hole in the
cardboard.
 &HT;    Ensuring that no light escapes except through the pinhole, put
the flashlight on a flat surface in a dark room, and angle the
light so you're not looking straight into it. Move 10 feet away and
you'll notice that the star is brighter when you look away from it
than it is when you look directly at it.
 &HT;    This provides more evidence that rods, which are most populous
in the periphery of vision, have greater sensitivity than the cones
that inhabit the center of the retina.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    EXPERIMENT 3
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Hold up your right index finger about 90 degrees from your
center of gaze. Now wiggle the finger vigorously, and notice how it
becomes much more visible while moving.
 &HT;    But if you look right at the same finger, it's just about as
noticeable moving as it is stationary. The reason: Rod-based
peripheral vision is vastly more sensitive to movement than it is
to small details, while the cone-based central vision is less
responsive to movement and more acute.
 &HT;    Remembering the physiological differences between your night and
day eyes can come in handy at times. For example, now you'll avoid
wearing red if you want friends to find you while you're scanning
the night sky with your peripheral vision, seeking out both faint
stars and the kind that you wish upon.

if you are outside on a tarmac, inside a client's office or in a
classroom full of kids.''
 &HT;    Or, in my case, standing in the rain, trying to get the
voiceprint lock to open between thunderclaps.
 &HT;    Striations in the eye's iris are a thousand times more
distinctive than the whorls on a finger, so in principle iris
prints should be even more reliable than fingerprints.
 &HT;    In 1995, the first iris scanners were successfully deployed to
provide security for prison doors and bank vaults, says Lou
Sassano, vice president of worldwide sales for IriScan, a New
Jersey company that holds patents on the technology.
 &HT;    Bank United of Texas recently set up three automatic teller
machines equipped with IriScan's technology in Dallas.
 &HT;    ``The recognition is so secure you do not have to use either
your ATM card or your PIN number,'' says Vern Stockton, a director
at Bank United.
 &HT;    Iris recognition adds approximately $5,000 to the overall
$15,000 to $35,000 cost of an ATM.
 &HT;    Late this year, IriScan will introduce a $200 camera for desktop
computers.
 &HT;    Part of the appeal of iris prints is that they require no
special action _ they can be read without a person's knowledge.
 &HT;    Facial recognition is prone to error but is even more stealthy.
Viisage Technology, a Massachusetts firm, has developed a system
that would allow police to scan a driver after they stop a vehicle.
Their approach, based on technology developed at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology Media Lab in the early 1990s, would use a
hidden camera on the officer's collar to photograph people in the
car. Then a pair of radios would transmit the image to the police
station, where a computer would run a comparison against a
face-recognition database and transmit an alert to the officer if
the driver were wanted or dangerous.
 &HT;    Another Viisage product, called Hunter, is designed to pick out
known terrorists from airport surveillance cameras. More than 50
casinos already use a similar system of hidden video cameras and
computers to identify known scam artists and cardsharps.
 &HT;    There are no laws in the United States to regulate the
collection or use of biometric information.
 &HT;    ``Biometrics is one of the most urgent privacy issues,'' says
Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center.
 &HT;    Biometric identifiers could replace Social Security numbers and
become a kind of ``informational flypaper,'' he says, so that
everything about you _ your product preferences, credit history,
youthful indiscretions _ sticks with you for life.
 &HT;    Someday you might feel a strange nostalgia for old-fashioned
signatures and ATM cards, not to mention locks and keys.

 By ERIC HASELTINE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A large organization works most efficiently when a job gets
divided up among specialists, each of whom does a limited set of
things exceptionally well.
 &HT;    The same holds true for the human nervous system. Such division
of labor is especially prominent in the eye, home to two highly
distinct networks of light processing neurons.
 &HT;    In one network, visual nerve cells activated by rod-shaped
receptors are exquisitely sensitive to dim light and motion, but
hopeless at resolving colors and small contours.
 &HT;    The other network, driven by receptors shaped like cones, is
very proficient at discerning colors and fine details, but
relatively inept at detecting faint light or subtle movement.
 &HT;    Despite their individual weaknesses, the rod and cone systems
make a great team, working together like two army scouts who've
agreed that one will scan the landscape for movement but hand off
to his partner the job of determining what it is that's moving.
 &HT;    We don't notice that we have two receptor systems because our
brains seamlessly combine their outputs. But with these tests you
can tease them apart.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    EXPERIMENT 1
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Compare the brightness of these two color patches. In strong
light, the red should look a little punchier. But if you turn down
the lights until the gap in the C above the colors is barely
discernible, the red should be the dimmer of the two hues.
 &HT;    That's because the cone system, which dominates vision in
daytime, responds well to red light, whereas the rod system, which
rules the night, can hardly see red at all.
 &HT;    This change in relative color brightness from day to night is
called the Purkinje shift, after Jan Evangelista Purkinje, the
Czech scientist who first described it.
 &HT;    The proportion of rods to cones is greater away from the center
of the retina where you fix your gaze, so the red splotch will look
even darker if you move it into rod territory by staring at the C
instead of directly at the colors.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    EXPERIMENT 2
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Make an artificial star by taping a piece of cardboard over the
lens of a flashlight and then pricking a tiny hole in the
cardboard.
 &HT;    Ensuring that no light escapes except through the pinhole, put
the flashlight on a flat surface in a dark room, and angle the
light so you're not looking straight into it. Move 10 feet away and
you'll notice that the star is brighter when you look away from it
than it is when you look directly at it.
 &HT;    This provides more evidence that rods, which are most populous
in the periphery of vision, have greater sensitivity than the cones
that inhabit the center of the retina.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    EXPERIMENT 3
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Hold up your right index finger about 90 degrees from your
center of gaze. Now wiggle the finger vigorously, and notice how it
becomes much more visible while moving.
 &HT;    But if you look right at the same finger, it's just about as
noticeable moving as it is stationary. The reason: Rod-based
peripheral vision is vastly more sensitive to movement than it is
to small details, while the cone-based central vision is less
responsive to movement and more acute.
 &HT;    Remembering the physiological differences between your night and
day eyes can come in handy at times. For example, now you'll avoid
wearing red if you want friends to find you while you're scanning
the night sky with your peripheral vision, seeking out both faint
stars and the kind that you wish upon.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Who needs debates when we've got Oprah Winfrey?
</P>
<P>
   The fuss over those showdowns set up by the official debate
commission seems like a big deal over nothing once you've seen
America's favorite TV talk-show host grill Al Gore and George W.
Bush about the ``real'' issues.
</P>
<P>
   The voting public doesn't need to see some pompous pundit firing
questions at Gore and Bush about foreign policy and taxation. The
electorate wants to hear about the would-be presidents' favorite
breakfast cereal and fast food; wants to hear them reminisce about
their favorite childhood memories; wants to see them get choked up
talking about how much they love their families.
</P>
<P>
   So now that both the Democratic and the Republican nominees for
president have chatted with Oprah, we know that Gore doesn't
usually eat cereal, but if he did, he'd eat Wheaties. We know that
Bush likes tacos. We know that both harbor fond memories of playing
baseball while growing up.
</P>
<P>
   We keep hearing that the 2000 presidential campaign is about
issues, that Gore's recent surge in the polls was a direct result
of his success in shifting the focus of the race from character and
personality to issues.
</P>
<P>
   And yet both candidates are sprinting from one talk show to the
next, trying to show the voters what great guys they are. Subjects
that are traditionally thought of as ``issues'' barely get a
mention when the candidates turn up on television with the likes of
Oprah, Jay Leno, David Letterman, Regis Philbin, Conan O'Brien ...
</P>
<P>
   The talk-show circuit has become such a highly visible element
of the campaign, in fact, that the candidates' guest spots with
Oprah, Jay, et al., seem to be getting as much _ more? _ news
coverage as the old-style stump speeches in VFW halls and public
squares.
</P>
<P>
   USA Today reported on the phenomenon last week, quoting Gore
spokesman Mark Fabiani's observation that ``in this day and age ...
working mothers and fathers don't get their news from the evening
news programs solely.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper also quoted Brent Bozell, chairman of the Media
Research Center:
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a whole lot of people who have left the traditional
political process. If you want to find them, you're not going to
find them by being on `Meet the Press.' You're going to find them
on `Oprah.'''

   And you're going to reach them by talking about things that
usually don't come up on ``Meet the Press.'' Wheaties. Tacos.
Memories of childhood.
</P>
<P>
   In a year when the traditional news media seems convinced that
the presidential campaign is about issues and what the voters think
about the issues, Oprah clearly has a different take on the
public's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Before introducing Bush last week, Winfrey told her audience
that she had avoided interviewing politicians in the past because
she figured that it would be impossible to cut through ``the
political wall'' of sound bites and ``practiced answers.''
</P>
<P>
   She figured it would be hard to cut through those devilish old
issues, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   But she apparently discovered a way to do it. The solution, she
said, was to ``ask questions that will help reveal the real man so
you can decide who feels like the right candidate for you.''
</P>
<P>
   What a great idea. Oprah wants to help her viewers decide which
candidate ``feels'' like the right one.
</P>
<P>
   No thinking required. It's all about ``feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not exactly a revolutionary concept, when you stop and
think about it _ if we might permit ourselves to stop and think as
we pursue the goal of determining which candidate ``feels'' most
qualified.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, voting for a president is always as much an
exercise in feeling as in thinking. Most voters trust their gut
instincts about which candidate will make the best leader, which
candidate will give us a sense of confidence and hope as we look to
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Those big-deal debates might tell us what these guys will do
about Bosnia. But only Oprah can find out what they eat for
breakfast.

 (Color art is available.) 
 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LOS ANGELES _ Running along one side of a dusty, dead-end street
deep in the Valley, there it is: the Beverly Hills Beach Club.
 &HT;    Not really. The striped awning is a prop that's been left
hanging outside the soundstage where Aaron Spelling's ``Beverly
Hills 90210'' was once filmed and which now accommodates his new
production, ``Titans.''
 &HT;    Inside, a couple of neon letters from the old ``Peach Pit'' sign
still cling to the wall, but in the center of the dimly lit expanse
sits a brand new, big, fake Beverly Hills mansion. Its study is
wood-paneled; the living room is prim and chilly and a
double-barreled staircase could accommodate a grand entrance or a
dramatic spill.
 &HT;    It's perfectly Spelling, and though he'd bristle at the thought,
a bit reminiscent of his '80s hit, ``Dynasty.''
 &HT;    But if the ``Titans'' set brings the good old days to mind,
Spelling promises that its fashion won't allude to Nolan Miller's
famously strong-shouldered moment, even though Miller has designed
a wedding dress for the first show.
 &HT;    ``Nolan tells me that they're showing broad-shouldered suits for
women in Paris,'' says Spelling, whose voice on the phone is grave
and has a sassy Hollywood twang. ``But we don't want to be
associated with `Dynasty,' so we won't be showing any. I guarantee,
not one shoulder pad.''
 &HT;    To that end Spelling brought in another former collaborator,
Cathyrn Wagner, who put together the show's jet-setting wardrobe.
 &HT;    Tucked into a corner behind the stately stage, her studio is
bursting with enough campy, vampy and stunning clothes to herald
the dawning of a new era. The get-ups Yasmine Bleeth will don as
Heather Lane during the show's debut season, which kicks off on NBC
at 8 p.m. on Oct. 4, take high-style hysterics to the brink.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, Bleeth's foil, Gwen Williams, played by Victorial
Principal, aims for something a little more chic, swathed in
Giorgio Armani, Ferragamo, Anne Klein and Richard Tyler.
 &HT;    ``Mr. Spelling likes clothing. He likes women and he loves women
dressed up,'' says Wagner, who served previously as the costume
stylist on ''90210.'' ``Sometimes, he'll call and say `What's with
all the leopard, Sweetheart?' But he's fair.''
 &HT;    Just as Wagner won't emulate the ``Dynasty'' look, the clothes
won't say ''90210,'' either. As Wagner likes to put it, she's moved
her shopping off of Melrose Avenue and onto Rodeo Drive.
 &HT;    ``Yasmine's character, Heather, is basically a shop girl who
married way up,'' Wagner says, flipping through Bleeth's bright
rack. ``Now she wants everybody in the universe to see just how
wealthy she is and how well she's done.''
 &HT;    There's the crystal studded Versace top, the new Christian Dior
saddle bag, full-length Pucci gown from episode four, the sequined
logo-print pants by Bottega Veneta, pieces from Dolce &AMP; Gabbana and
Diane Von Furstenberg, a handful of rhinestone belts and vintage
Yves Saint Laurent, all in the gold, red, turquoise and fuchsia
that are the character's hallmark.
 &HT;    The ultimate piece, however, is a tiny mink bikini which is worn
on the show with loads of jewelry and sky-high heels.
 &HT;    ``When we put it together it gets a little tarty,'' Wagner says.
``Heather is very `Valley of the Dolls.' That's how we refer to her
_ but that's the most complimentary name.''
 &HT;    Heather's look is sexy, to be sure. ``Men who don't watch serial
television will be watching,'' says Spelling, who is an executive
producer of the show. ``We couldn't find smaller bathing suits.''
 &HT;    Just don't expect Bleeth to be shown hanging out of said bikini.
``I hate it when you see that,'' he continues. ``Call me square,
but they won't be dressed like sluts.''
 &HT;    Fashion victim might be the more accurate term. ``When we first
spoke, Yasmine said she wanted her character to look like the cover
of Vogue every week,'' Wagner recalls. ``I said `If you do that,
you realize that every once in a while there has to be a zinger _
something that just doesn't work.' And she said `I know, I know!
That's exactly what I want.'''
 &HT;    For the boardroom, it's Emporio Armani's fuchsia jacket and a
pair of white pants, or Tehen's curvy red suit, a Spelling
favorite.
 &HT;    ''`Titans' is about fashion and passion,'' he says.
 &HT;    In fact, he's so passionate about fashion that he preapproves
every costume.
 &HT;    ``I'm a nut about it. You're going to laugh, but before we film
I look over a book of Polaroids showing three different ideas for
each change.''
 &HT;    After all, Bleeth's Heather is the head of Dress2K.com, a
fashion Web site of her very own. In episode three, she even hosts
a runway show, featuring clothes that come courtesy of Nolan
Miller, whose assistant Mark Zanino designed the lot. Miller also
personally designed a wedding dress for Bleeth's character.
 &HT;    For her own part, however, Wagner sticks to shopping. It's what
she does best.
 &HT;    ``There is a lot of great stuff out there. Why design
something?'' she says.
 &HT;    Though she can't discuss her budget, Wagner has been shopping
almost every day since July to supply the 70 or so costume changes
that occur in every episode.
 &HT;    ``At this point, in the shops I sound like a kid collecting
baseball cards: got it, got it, don't got it, don't want it,''
Wagner says, laughing. ``Sometimes Yasmine could have as many as
seven costume changes,'' she adds. ``Of course, one might be naked
under the covers, so it's usually five or six.''
 &HT;    But life could get a whole lot easier for Wagner once the
fashion world tunes in. Bottega Veneta's reps have already sent in
some clothes; ABS lets Wagner pull right from the racks in the
factory downtown and Wagner has struck up a relationship with
Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton.
 &HT;    ``On `90210,' people would give us stuff and I would usually
give them a photo from the show,'' she says. ``I mean a photo of
Yasmine Bleeth wearing your bikini sitting on the table during
market week is going to sell that suit fifty times over.''
 &HT;    Wagner was part of the Armani team who launched A(AT)X on the
West Coast, and she worked at Ralph Lauren as a buyer and for Donna
Karan merchandising, before making the switch to costuming.
 &HT;    In college, however, she majored in acting and had performed in
plays during her high school years in Los Angeles alongside Val
Kilmer and Kevin Spacey, who was also her prom date.
 &HT;    ``This is sort of a synthesis of fashion and theater,'' she
says. ``Clothing can transform an actor into a character.''
 &HT;    Big name designers became interested in gaining screen time for
their wares after ``Sex and the City'' began offering prime-time
placement.
 &HT;    Though Wagner wants to work with designers, she won't risk
sending out anything that might upstage her actors _ like the
glitzy $900 handbags she finds distracting on that show.
 &HT;    ``If the clothing is too exorbitant or too silly, it detracts,''
she says. ``It should be appropriate to the scene and then turned
up a notch. It should be just a little bit better than reality
is.''
 &HT;    And that, of course, is what Spelling is all about.
 &HT;    ``Wait until you see it,'' he concludes. ``You're gonna
scream.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    ALMOST PARADISE
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Where were you in '73?
 &HT;    If you were sitting in your bedroom listening to The Who, Joni
or Yes, you can definitely relate to William Miller, the hero of
Cameron Crowe's semi-autobiographical coming-of-age film, ``Almost
Famous,'' about his experience as a teen-age journalist for Rolling
Stone.
 &HT;    At the recent premiere at the Chelsea West Cinema in Manhattan,
sponsored by the now-venerable music magazine, celebrities of all
ages _ including John Leguizamo, Donovan Leitch, Bebe Neuwirth,
Mariska Hargitay and Fisher Stevens _ heartily applauded the film.
 &HT;    The clapping was certainly music to the ears of Dreamworks
co-head Jeffrey Katzenberg, director Crowe and the performers in
attendance: Billy Crudup (who arrived with gal pal Mary Louise
Parker), Frances McDormand (can you say Oscar nomination?), Philip
Seymour Hoffman (magnificent as always as renegade rock critic
Lester Bangs), Oscar winner Anna Paquin and Patrick Fugit, who
plays Miller.
 &HT;    Especially radiant was leading lady Kate Hudson, who sat next to
her very famous mom, Goldie Hawn. The young actress, who looks like
the love child of Hawn and Drew Barrymore, is a star in the making.
 &HT;    However, one performer _ albeit in a cameo performance as a
taxicab passenger _ was noticeably absent: Rolling Stone founder
Jann Wenner.
 &HT;    After the screening, designer (and noted rock-and-roll fan)
Tommy Hilfiger _ nattily attired in a window-pane suit _ pronounced
the film ``entertaining and engaging.''
 &HT;    ``Third Watch'' hunk Eddie Cibrian was also full of praise. ``I
really liked it even though I was born in 1973,'' he remarked.
 &HT;    Also giving the film high marks at the post-screening party at
Centro-Fly, which was renamed for the evening (but not redecorated)
in honor of the legendary Max's Kansas City, were a gray-bearded
Tim Robbins, who came with stepdaughter Eva Amurri (the spitting
image of mom Susan Sarandon) and Ethan Hawke (minus Uma), who
decided to make a bowling shirt his fashion statement.
 &HT;    Along with film, theater was on the mind of some of the guests:
A decidedly scruffy Kevin Bacon (maybe he was just trying to look
like a rock star?) came with wife Kyra Sedgwick, who is working
``hard, hard, hard'' on ``Stranger,'' a new play that begins
previews later this month at Off-Broadway's Vineyard Theatre.
 &HT;    ``Cabaret's'' new leading lady, former sitcom star Lea Thompson,
was still riding the high of a thunderous ovation at the ``Broadway
on Broadway'' concert in Times Square. ``I was so scared, and I am
so glad it went well. It's such a great part.''
 &HT;    And the ageless Michele Lee, preparing for her return to
Broadway in Charles Busch's hilarious ``The Tale of the Allergist's
Wife,'' confided the show is even better than it was during its
sold-out run earlier this year at Manhattan Theatre Club.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    DIAMONDS IN THE ROUGH
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The Oscars are still many months away, but the fierce battle to
bejewel next year's nominees is already heating up.
 &HT;    In an unprecedented bid to encourage actresses to wear its
baubles at the 2001 Academy Awards ceremony, the Italian jeweler
Bulgari will allow a select number of nominees and presenters to
design their own necklaces.
 &HT;    No word yet on how much leeway the ladies will have with their
designs _ or whether they'll be allowed to keep them _ but the
company is likely to have some fairly stylish necks to adorn. Last
year, its jewels turned up on the likes of Winona Ryder, Chloe
Sevigny and Charlize Theron.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    PRADA NEWS
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Is red the new color at Prada?
 &HT;    Sources say the Italian fashion house is scouting locations for
a party during Paris fashion week to celebrate its new Miu Miu
boutique _ and one of the spots they're considering is none other
than the Communist Party headquarters in the 10th arrondissement, a
futuristic-in-a-'70s-way cement structure by architect Oscar
Niemeyer.
 &HT;    It would be a fitting choice, given that Miuccia Prada was once
an ardent left-winger.
 &HT;    Although Prada declined to confirm that location, a spokeswoman
assured it would choose a venue based on its architecture, not its
politics.

 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    New York is marching to a retro beat, with a bit of flashy
glamour thrown in for good measure.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    TAWFIK MOUNAYER: UP FOR THE PART
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``I love clothes _ that's the bottom line,'' declared Tawfik
Mounayer while fussing around a model done up in his long purple
chiffon dress.
 &HT;    Last week, Tawfik staged his first-ever runway show, thanks to
the blood, sweat and tears of family and friends.
 &HT;    ``This show,'' he says, ``was built on favor upon favor.''
 &HT;    It was also built on beautiful clothes, a fresh, graceful
display that crossed an appealing sportswear attitude with a
healthy dose of youthful Saint Laurent reverence. Not bad for a
young man _ he's 25 _ who only graduated from the Parsons School of
Design last year.
 &HT;    But then, this is a guy who has faced tougher challenges: He
notes in passing that surgery for a benign brain tumor kept him in
school an extra year. When a visitor comments on his blase tone, he
says, ``It's all gone now.''
 &HT;    At Parsons, Mounayer had internships at Isaac Mizrahi and
Chanel, and after graduation went to work as an assistant designer
at Ann Taylor, where he learned the nuts and bolts of the fashion
business: sourcing, production, how to cut fabric and how to make a
``two-cent button look like a million bucks.''
 &HT;    Although his experience there was invaluable, he was frustrated
creatively and started designing on his own at home in the
evenings.
 &HT;    Before he knew it, he had quite a few pieces, and friends urged
him to do a show. Seven months later, models marched down the
runway wearing his spring 2001 collection, which the designer aptly
called ``Audition.''
 &HT;    Of course, it remains to be seen whether he gets the part. Right
now, Mounayer says he would love to do something small _ very
small, which he would produce himself _ for an adventurous retailer
willing to pay up front. Prices would wholesale from about $150 to
$1,000.
 &HT;    In addition to Saint Laurent, Mounayer cites Claire McCardell,
all American sportswear, and most importantly, his mother Nadia,
who passed away while he was in high school, as his inspirations.
 &HT;    ``My mother was my biggest influence,'' he says. ``I loved
rummaging through her closet as a kid, and by age 11, I was sewing
and designing full Barbie collections.'' (The closet was in
Syracuse, N.Y., where the Palestinian Mounayer was raised.)
 &HT;    He adds that his mother and aunts had a penchant for glitz:
''`Solve it with a sequin' was always my mother's mantra.
 &HT;    ``I just want to design real clothes that make women look
good,'' he continues.
 &HT;    To that end, he recently quit his job with Ann Taylor (he said
his former bosses and co-workers are very supportive) so he can
pursue his own collection full time, and he'll even wait tables if
that's what it takes to survive.
 &HT;    ``Of course I am looking for backers _ look what happened to
Miguel (Adrover). He was a big inspiration to have my show.''
 &HT;    Right now though, everything has exceeded his expectations.
 &HT;    ``I really just wanted to introduce myself,'' Mounayer explains,
``and say 'Hey, I design clothes' and get some feedback.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES
 &HT;    
 &HT;    New York's fashion cup runneth over. What was once a single week
of fashion shows has been extended to nearly two, with a huge
number of designers on the schedule. And as the action got underway
this week, there were some definite highpoints, often with a retro
attitude.
 &HT;    One hit was Russell Bennett's ``In the Now'' collection. Bennett
travelled back in time, returning with a swanky assortment of '20s-
and '40s-inspired looks. He hit Art Deco and gangster sex appeal on
the mark with graceful printed dresses and suits finished with
fedoras and gold chain necklaces.
 &HT;    Gabrielle Hamill called her show ``Cakewalk'', inspired, she
said, by memories of her grandmother's expert cake decorating for
the county fair. Guests sat at tables featuring elaborate Barbie
doll cakes and delicious cupcakes from Angelika Torn and Cupcake
Cafe.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, however, that homey mood sometimes translated to
dowdy clothes with a Fifties-homemaker feel in tweed apron dresses
paired with a pleated hem skirts and embroidered cotton dresses.
 &HT;    Shin Choi also took a stroll down memory lane for her first
show. Although known for streamlined stretch sportswear, this time
she opted for a softer, more gentle look. That meant tossing her
sleek monochromatic numbers and replacing them with herringbone
suits, butterfly sequined blouses and zig-zag patterns a la Marcia
Brady.
 &HT;    Some of the sweetness played well, but in the end, all those
stripes and florals were a little too much to handle.
 &HT;    Not all of these early birds were in a nostalgic mood. CD Greene
has always had some sizzlers in his evening collections, but now he
showed a whimsical side via dresses with Lucite puzzle pieces as
well as others done up with those predictable paillettes.
 &HT;    Greene worked his puzzles on neon-bright jersey gowns or as
cutouts edging asymmetric leather minis. But while these were
appealing, some of the other looks _ jumpsuits and illusion dresses
in particular _ needed their tart-quotient turned down to simmer.
 &HT;    Donna Haag opted for a ``Tropical Chic'' theme, and whisked her
audience away to a South Pacific paradise. Underneath a ceiling of
tropical fronds, guests enjoyed fresh mango juice and coconut,
while Haag's colorful floral dresses breezed by.
 &HT;    The orchid and bird of paradise-print dresses looked fresh and
fun, as did the rhinestone-speckled skirts and tops. But the knits
hit way under par, right alongside the floral scuba looks.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ESCADA
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Although Escada is well known in the U.S., the German company
has never had a formal runway presentation during New York fashion
week.
 &HT;    The show on Sept. 13, held in conjunction with the G&AMP;P
Foundation, a charitable organization for cancer, was a first for
the company.
 &HT;    ``Escada has been a very loyal patron to the G&AMP;P,'' said its
founder Denise Rich. ``We have a good partnership. They believe in
our cause.''
 &HT;    One of the evening's objectives, which included a dinner after
the show, was to focus attention on G&AMP;P's annual charity event, the
Angel Ball, scheduled for Nov. 30.
 &HT;    The front row sported a motley crew, including Ivana Trump,
Raquel Welch, Jane Seymour, Christian Campbell of ``Trick,'' Adam
Goldberg from ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Eddie Cibrian from ``Third
Watch,'' Janine Turner and S. Epatha Merkerson of ``Law and
Order.''
 &HT;    Goldie Hawn showed up during dinner.
 &HT;    ``You know,'' Welch said, ``this is the first show I've been to
since the '60s, when I was first discovered and flown over to Paris
for the Saint Laurent show.''
 &HT;    This time out she was decked in pinstriped Escada.
 &HT;    ``I like Escada because it's tailored,'' she said. ``This is not
going to be the Britney Spears kind of show. I liked what she wore
to MTV, which is great if you're performing on stage. But it's not
for me. I never really wore see-through things before. Did I? Well,
maybe I did.''
 &HT;    On the runway, Escada didn't show sheer, but there were lots of
racy little sequined pieces to supply the sizzle factor which was
sometimes tempered with crisp white shirts tied at the waist.
 &HT;    While sparkly bras and bikinis have limited real-life range,
that tailoring that Raquel loves is another story. There was plenty
of that, too, in a diverse lineup of suits and jackets, with an
emphasis on leather and shantung.
 &HT;    For evening, sparkle ruled again, in sexy, elaborately encrusted
evening gowns. But those with a truly dramatic bent might go for
the over-the-top gold matador suit or red tiered lace ``Carmen''
gown. Ole!
 &HT;    
 &HT;    GEN ART
 &HT;    
 &HT;    What do Jennifer Love Hewitt, cell phones, Polly Allen Mellen
and a 1970s Halston model-turned-cyber entrepreneur have in common?
 &HT;    Quite possibly nothing, but that didn't hurt the vibe at the
sixth annual Gen Art Fresh Faces in Fashion Show, held Wednesday
night at the Metropolitan Pavilion. The venue accommodated a
capacity crowd, in which Christina Aguilera look-alikes easily
outnumbered Britney Spears types.
 &HT;    The show was sponsored by Nokia and Ford Motor Co., as well as
IPnetworks.com, a Web enterprise that has taken upon itself the
heady task of ``bringing licensing to cyberspace.''
 &HT;    Chris Royer, the director of fashion for the year-old
IPnetworks.com, was a Halston model during the designer's heyday.
Despite her mentor's licensing nightmares, Royer still believes
that upstart designers can benefit from the type of exposure
cyberspace licensing can provide.
 &HT;    ``Young designers especially need to know the empowering side of
licensing,'' Royer said. ``If it's developed in the correct way it
can give them global exposure.''
 &HT;    After a brief delay, the evening got started as Gen Art
executive director Ian Gerard ceded the stage to Jennifer Love
Hewitt, clad in Diane Von Furstenberg, at which time the actress
presented a $2,500 award for best cell-phone accessory.
 &HT;    The winner, a succinct Kenny Hwang, said: ``This just proves you
have to have a good time doing what you're doing.''
 &HT;    Love then relinquished the stage to designer Michael Kors, who
made a tender speech in honor of Polly Allen Mellen, which
highlighted her commitment to unearthing emerging fashion talent by
any means necessary. He then presented her with a 60-page,
hand-illustrated story book designed by Ruben Toledo.
 &HT;    Mellen made a rousing speech, asserting that ``using the same
designers over and over again is a cop-out,'' and then revealed her
scintillating head-to-toe Kors outfit to a clamor of applause.
 &HT;    Then the show began, each designer or design team prefacing
their runway offering with an extreme close-up, MTV-style video
resume. Memorable lines included: ``By accident of life I started
doing nothing,'' ``I was born in France some time ago,'' ``I want a
bite of the big American pie,'' and ``My clothes are not
necessarily meant for mass production.''
 &HT;    As for the clothes, of the 12 designers, Alicia Bell was the
standout. Bell's fitted corset blouses with lace trims, skirts with
pleated godets and lots of zigzag and fishtail hems with pleats had
a romantic turn-of-the-century appeal. Other noteworthy designers
included Maia Madariaga with her soft, buttery leather looks in
strong colors as well as pieces adorned with silver chain trim to
create fringe-like effects.
 &HT;    There was also quirky knitwear from French native, Pierrot,
whose collection revolved around the kitsch factor of French
nationalism. The design duo known as Trosman-Churba presented its
``fun-tional artwear,'' which translated to such looks as a fitted
denim jacket with a gold foil leaf print.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LORO PIANA
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Everyone knows Loro Piana has luscious cashmeres. But at the
informal presentation of the spring collection, the company showed
its design range _ and it goes way beyond the precious fiber for
which it's famous.
 &HT;    Luxury was a top priority, delivered in silk, leather and linen
as well as cashmere, of course. Fun little bomber jackets,
HotPants, suits with ruffled blouses and a provocative wrap halter
proved that sexy and tasteful can co-exist.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LIBERTY
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Making a push for a stronger U.S. business, London-based Liberty
decided to take its show on the road with a presentation in New
York hosted by Thomas Harris, the British Consul General, and his
wife.
 &HT;    Designers Claire Corrigan and Corinne Barker showed 20 pieces in
an informal showing at Boylan Studios, and not surprisingly,
fabrics were the big draw. Those traditional Liberty florals showed
up in a teeny bikini and a classic topper, updated with a slick
nylon coating.
 &HT;    The duo also dug into the archives and revived an Art Nouveau
fan pattern for full pants and little shells. But they didn't just
rely on the past. For example, a brand new psychedelic floral
turned up on a gown, complete with train and matching scarf. While
the pattern play was dizzying at times, for Liberty fans, it's all
in good fun.

 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Imitation of Christ's fall show was a remarkable fashion moment
_ quite beautiful but with a funeral theme _ while, elsewhere, Tom
Ford unveiled his lush, racy and much-awaited new campaign for
YSL's Opium.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    IMITATION OF CHRIST
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Drop-dead gorgeous. With the mandatory silly pun duly recorded,
it can be said that the Imitation of Christ collection shown on
Sept. 17 by Tara Subkoff and Matt Damhave was that, and a whole lot
more.
 &HT;    The presentation passed from merely creepy _ a fashion show
impersonating a wake _ to genuinely bizarre, in that a real funeral
parlor, the Peter Jarema Funeral Home on East Seventh Street,
allowed the faux mourning on its premises.
 &HT;    Reactions ranged from fashionably blase to uncomfortable to
offended, while Subkoff's mom Cheryl wrote the schtick off to
showbiz: ``There was a lot of drama and flair. But what else would
you expect? Tara is a movie actress!''
 &HT;    One young woman who works with the design team projected piety
onto the venue selection: ``Tara's uncle passed away recently, and
she felt this was the right setting now.''
 &HT;    Someone else noted that Subkoff cleared the idea with her aunt,
a Catholic nun. But backstage, Subkoff refused to get personal:
``Let's just say no comment. Well, there's someone in my family who
is very involved in the Catholic church. I wouldn't do anything to
hurt her. I don't want to say anything else about her. It's
tacky.''
 &HT;    Fine with us, because the show offered plenty to ruminate on
without involving religious relatives. Questions such as, What
makes a designer? How does one quantify the value of a celebrity
connection? Is the very notion of anti-fashion a myth?
 &HT;    In one whirlwind season, Subkoff and Damhave have proclaimed
their disdain for the fashion system, billing themselves as purists
in a cauldron of mercenary scum. At the same time, they have
operated like a pair of crafty vets.
 &HT;    Initially they flaunted their famous friend, Chloe Sevigny, at
every photo op, and, for this show, embraced her as an artistic
collaborator.
 &HT;    Listed as ``creative director'' on their program, Sevigny worked
tirelessly backstage, dressing models, barking orders, demanding
that ``anyone not part of the production get off the scrim!''
 &HT;    She then came out _ just in time for the wailing to begin _
taking her front-row seat beside Natasha Lyonne. After the show,
Chloe said she's ``feeling for the men's stuff _ and I'm going to
wear it.'' She then went on to explain the essence of the clothes:
``I had seen the stuff already, so I know that a huge amount of
work went into it. But what I want to know is whether the audience
will get that.''
 &HT;    Which again goes back to the issue of what makes a designer. The
premise behind IOC is ``fashion resurrected'' _ rethought,
reworked, recycled. The clothes Subkoff and Damhave showed
indicated all of the above, to varying degrees.
 &HT;    Some pieces were heavily amended; others looked barely touched.
Some dripped with chic. Others dripped with fake blood and gory
pathos; bandages wrapped one young man's wrists, as if after a
suicide attempt.
 &HT;    Despite such indulgences, what was very clear was that someone
here has fabulous taste, a discerning eye, a savvy feel for what
looks chic. And yes, with all of the one-of-a-kind surprises, one
could extract themes, most notably a military motif, and black _ of
course _ for a bounty of dresses from '40s-ish lace to haute
construction run amok. Is it all any less valid than the work of
designers who routinely send out near-verbatim retro looks?
 &HT;    Apparently, the stores think not. The presentation ended with a
handsome young man dressed as a priest advising mourners that the
wake was now over. Afterwards, Beth Sheperd and Sarah Hailes of
Kirna Zabete rushed backstage.
 &HT;    ``The show was deeply disturbing,'' said Shepard. ``But the
clothes were amazing.''
 &HT;    And although nothing has been signed, if the gods of fashion are
smiling on Barneys New York, that store could be imitating Christ _
with the entire collection on the floor.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    OPIUM
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Opium, whose rich scent and provocative name has always had a
taste for the forbidden, is living up to its reputation.
 &HT;    Its first international ad campaign under Tom Ford, Yves Saint
Laurent's creative director features a nude photograph of Sophie
Dahl clutching her breast with her eyes closed. Actually the only
things she's wearing are a jeweled bracelet, necklace and
high-heeled sandals. The ad was photographed by Steven Meisel.
 &HT;    The Opium campaign, which is Ford's first for YSL, is intended
to breathe new life into what is the company's best-selling
fragrance. The new ads also represent the most dramatic step Ford
and Chantal Roos, president of YSL Beaute, have taken in
revitalizing YSL Beaute's franchise.
 &HT;    Describing the campaign as ``sexy and provocative,'' Ford said
the image of Dahl in an erotic repose ``relates to the history of
the house,'' and the personality of the fragrance itself.
 &HT;    ``Opium, for me, is something that's forbidden, something that's
rich,'' he said. ``I just didn't want a skinny, starved, girl
model.''
 &HT;    Enter the voluptuous, womanly, uninhibited Dahl.
 &HT;    ``I wanted someone who looks like she's had too much of
everything: too much food, too much sex, too much love,'' he said.
``I mean, this is a woman who doesn't deny herself anything.''
 &HT;    To underline the richness and decadence of the fragrance, Ford
had Dahl's hair dyed a deep red and had her recline on a blanket of
dark fur.
 &HT;    ``And even though she's nude, I wanted her to appear as though
she's dressed, so she's wearing high-heeled shoes and yellow
jewels,'' he said.
 &HT;    Ford acknowledged that the image is bound to evoke strong
reactions, but he reasoned that ``a fragrance is supposed to be
sexy'' since it's worn on the skin, applied when one is in a state
of undress and fully appreciated in close, intimate situations.
 &HT;    Of course, given the enormous curiosity of how Ford will
reinterpret the legendary YSL style, one might be prone to
extrapolate from this image that it will be represent Ford's
direction for the French brand. Not so, said Ford.
 &HT;    ``It's not indicative at all of the collection I'll be showing
in three weeks because obviously she's not wearing any clothes,''
he said. ``It's one of the first things I did creatively and there
are certain aspects of it that are indicative of what we'll see in
the future,'' in terms of the attitude and expression of the brand.
 &HT;    As for his next act, Ford said he plans to shoot spring-summer
2001 campaigns for Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent after the
international runway season ends in mid-October. After that, he'll
turn his attention to the stable of other YSL fragrances and the
French fragrance and jewelry house Boucheron, which Gucci Group
bought last May.
 &HT;    Ford said he's been an admirer of Meisel's work for years and,
``I've been waiting for the perfect moment to work with him. I was
so impressed with Steven and his entire team. They were so
completely open to ideas.''
 &HT;    ``Opium was definitely a priority at YSL Beaute,'' said Roos,
who launched the brand in 1977 during her first tenure at YSL.
Opium went on to become the bellwether of the Eighties blockbuster
scents, and a scandal in its own right with its druggy name and its
ad campaigns featuring an insensate Jerry Hall.
 &HT;    ``We consider it as a main pillar of the brand,'' said Roos.
``We could address it very quickly [with a revamp], whereas
developing new lines takes a period of time. Tom and I decided that
the most important thing was to address the revamping of the Opium
campaign.''
 &HT;    The print ad campaign breaks in the October Vogue and will run
worldwide in November in women's magazines. Beginning in December,
ads featuring Dahl will also run in European cinemas.
 &HT;    ``There will be a huge concentration on Opium through media and
such things as window displays featuring the ad,'' said Roos. The
company declined to reveal its fall budget.
 &HT;    Since Opium's inception in 1977, the fragrance has embraced
fantasy and has lived on the daring side. Earlier this year, Opium
was banned in China because the Chinese government business bureau
decided its name was ``improper.''
 &HT;    For the new ad campaign, Meisel went to Los Angeles and shot
Dahl in the manner of a modern icon. Pat McGrath did the makeup and
Orlando Pita styled the hair.
 &HT;    The ad is intended to be a portrait of luxury and lust with
Dahl's pearly white body and red hair against a background of fur
and black leather. The fragrance bottle is conspicuous in its
absence. A YSL spokesman said the company has encountered no
problems in running the nude image in the magazines it has
contracted with for fall.
 &HT;    Curiosity about what Ford will do with the legendary brand is
running extremely high in Paris. Shoppers got a small glimpse last
month when YSL boutiques and trendy store Colette received a
shipment of new fall bags, the first designed by Ford's team.
 &HT;    Colette reported brisk sales of the two styles it's carrying: a
leather tote with trapunto stitching in a ``Y'' formation and a
shoulder bag with a chain link strap.
 &HT;    Tongues have also been wagging about the YSL shop on the
Faubourg Saint-Honore in Paris, which was closed in August for
minor renovations and sprucing up. It's not a new retail concept,
Saint Laurent officials say, but industry types have been
commenting that the shop is already feeling a lot hipper, the sales
staff all dressed sleekly in black.
 &HT;    A small pre-spring collection designed by Ford won't be
delivered to stores until November, meaning the fashion pack will
have to wait until Oct. 13 to see his interpretation of YSL. That's
when he'll show his spring collection at the Musee Rodin on the
last day of Paris fashion week.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    WILLIAM REID
 &HT;    
 &HT;    He's best known for his men's wear. But William Reid's
collaboration with Tony Smith, formerly of The Smiths, who served
as creative director on Reid's first women's collection, will
certainly help put that line on the map. Charm school finesse
surfaced in the form of sweet eyelet and lace skirts shown with
polished jersey blouses.
 &HT;    And, although the overall feeling was clearly feminine, there
were touches of men's wear tailoring in such looks as a great gray
wool skirt and cool pleated pants. The fresh details included
twisted straps on a striped tank dress, a tulle overlay on a
gingham dress and suede insets on a denim jacket.
 &HT;    Reid's solid presentation wasn't the only cause for celebration,
however _ there was also the fact that it was shown at his new,
bigger space on West 28th St.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    DANA BUCHMAN
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Classic sportswear _ that's what brings the Buchman customer
back season after season. But for spring 2001, the designer
ventured beyond her basic fare to reveal a sassy side.
 &HT;    For starters, she's doing lots of leather in a range of fruity
colors. Then she added hip tank tops paired with narrow skirts and
even a pair of red-hot metallic pants. A sexy one-shouldered dress
in a tropical print had Palm Beach written all over it.
 &HT;    Buchman's more conservative clients, however, shouldn't despair.
Forties-style glen plaid pantsuits a la Marlene Dietrich and
jackets with large-scale houndstooth patterns should fill the bill.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MARC ECKO
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Ecko wants to play with the big boys, and, because his Ecko
Unlimited collection has grown into a multimillion-dollar business
in the six years since it was started, he has the means to do so.
 &HT;    This season, for his Ecko Red women's collection, he showed just
18 looks, all sexy and streamlined _ a dramatic and positive change
from last season's overly deconstructed pieces of ``art.''
 &HT;    What worked best were the circle-print halter, the stenciled
looks and the flag kimono, part of a group that depicted political
figures _ a hot topic in this election year. The single-sleeve
treatments, layered box-pleated skirts and culottes a la Girbaud,
however, should have been left behind.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SOLD
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Sometimes it's not such a bad thing to forgo the runway. At
Sold, Jenisa Washington opted to pass on a formal presentation,
showing her hip safari and ladylike looks on 20 mannequins. And the
results were just right.
 &HT;    There were plenty of her beautiful signature leathers, including
a jungle-ready goat suede wrap dress and a classy shift with a
leather bouquet, all in soft blush, straw and chocolate tones.
Washington also cut some mean wovens _ a frayed-edged safari
jacket, little denim shorts and cuffed culottes. For a
four-season-old business, she's off to a great start _ she's
already selling to Barneys New York, Ultimo and Fred Segal.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MOET &AMP; CHANDON
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Showcasing up-and-coming design talents has been a pet project
for Moet &AMP; Chandon for four seasons now. And at Sunday's show, the
lineup featured three of downtown's favorite ``It'' girls: Sally
Penn, Alice Roi and Lizzy Disney. For Penn, who has become one to
watch, persistence has paid off.
 &HT;    In a collection that was more sophisticated and polished than
usual, she managed to mix comfort and cool. Highlights included the
open-back voile tops and tennis skirts, a Swiss dot pintuck dress
and wide-leg pants. The ``thong'' skirts, which provided a
visible-panty-line effect, were imaginative, but not what you'd
call flattering.
 &HT;    Roi, who likes to reinvent the '80s in a wearable but campy way,
went for the ``Dynasty''/Giorgio Beverly Hills scene this time _
with a naughty edge. She did lots of miniskirts, while some of her
best looks were the appliqued velour pieces, the strapless
minidress and the tuxedo bib dress.
 &HT;    The designer should stay away from those hard-to-fit swimwear
shapes, however. Bikinis bulged in an unsightly way, and the
handkerchief hems were a tad too short.
 &HT;    Disney, the last to show, did a disappointing collection. The
dropped-back satin top and dress worked well, and some of the pants
had intriguing cuff details, but she lost her way with the
``falling down'' pieces, styled to fall off the body, and the
detached, open-back, cape-like sleeves, which simply looked
awkward.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    FASHION SCOOPS
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Circular Thinking: Some celebrities just can't get over how nice
the fashion business is. To them, anyway.
 &HT;    ``It used to be about fashion and actresses, but now maybe it's
fashion and books,'' said writer Candace Bushnell as she arrived at
the DKNY store on Madison Avenue on Thursday night to launch the
store's Literary Series with her bestseller, ''4 Blondes.'' She was
impressed that the shop had provided her a red leather miniskirt,
sweater and matching patent leather boots for the event.
 &HT;    ``I actually wanted to wear this hat that I found that is so
Petula Clark with these boots,'' she said, then took a detour on
that train of thought and commented that the boots, because of
their loose fit, were actually ``very Christopher Robin. I'm
feeling very Pooh right now.''
 &HT;    So what does Christopher Robin have to do with Petula Clark?
 &HT;    ``They're both English, I guess,'' she continued, grabbing a
Piper mini from a waiter and changing course once more. ``I never
drank champagne from a straw before. Does that make you drunk
faster? I'm always afraid they've dropped a shot of whiskey in
these anyway.''
 &HT;    Going back to the original subject at hand, Bushnell mused at
the DKNY-clad turnout for her book signing, which included actress
Kim Cattrall from the Bushnell-inspired ``Sex and the City'' show
as well as the three current members of Destiny's Child _ Kelly,
Beyonce and Michelle.
 &HT;    ``Whoever said fashion was shallow?'' Bushnell asked. ``It's
changing. It reads!''
 &HT;    The singers were certainly impressed as well. The trio plan to
take a day off from their concert tour to attend several runway
shows, including DKNY's.
 &HT;    ``I can't believe they're putting us in the front row,'' said
Beyonce.
 &HT;    ...And then...Perhaps they weren't so naive after all. Destiny's
Child wore gold paillette dresses, sweaters and sparkly pants to
the DKNY party, all company-provided, naturally.
 &HT;    ``We dress alike because we are a group,'' Beyonce said. ``I
feel it's important that when people see us in a room that it's
obvious we're a group, like the Supremes or En Vogue.''
 &HT;    But Beyonce made a quick change into some simple sportswear on
her way downtown to Visionaire's seasonal fest, this time
celebrating punk with an exhibit at the publication's Mercer Street
gallery of the Seventies work of Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm
McLaren.
 &HT;    Also on hand were artist Tom Sachs and Belgium men's wear
designer Dirk Schonberger, who was amused at the idea that a party
celebrating the punk movement would draw musicians of such a
breadth of style as Destiny's Child and Bjork.
 &HT;    ``What is it with Americans always having parties to celebrate
things that already happened?'' he asked.
 &HT;    Well then, a toast to things in the future _ the designer,
picked up by stores like Jeffrey and Barneys New York, disclosed
that he'll give women's wear a shot next year.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Beach Bound: Shoshanna Lonstein is launching a new swimwear
line. The social celebrity turned designer, whose two-year-old
dress business has been a hit at retail, said she will introduce
the line of bikinis in January at Bloomingdale's.
 &HT;    ``Since my early adolescence, I have been unable to find a
bikini that fits me properly,'' Lonstein said. ``I hope that my
swim collection fills the void in the market that has made going to
the beach such a challenge for so many.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Question and Answer: Indie actresses Summer Phoenix and Natasha
Lyonne turned out for Moet &AMP; Chandon's Designer Debut to support
their friend Lizzy Disney, one of three participating designers.
They were somewhat annoyed, however, at the phalanx of
photographers that greeted them.
 &HT;    While sitting in the front row, Lyonne lit up a cigarette, and
later offered one to Phoenix, who was somewhat less recognizable in
the crowd. One photographer, in fact, asked her, ``Are you
Summer?''
 &HT;    ``Yes, I am someone,'' she replied.
 &HT;    She answered the same perfunctory questions, over and over _
``Lizzy is a close friend I met a long time ago _ I like her
clothes because they are sexy and casual.''
 &HT;    Her next film is ``Esther Kahn,'' her first starring role,
playing a young Jewish girl in late 19th-century London who aspires
to be an actress; she's now working on some independent projects.
 &HT;    When Lauren Ezersky of ``Behind the Velvet Rope'' came over,
thrusting her mike into Lyonne's face, Phoenix turned to her
neighbor and proved her acting ability. ``Can I ask you a
question?'' she repeated in Ezersky's Queens-meets-Valley Girl
accent, somehow stretching out her nose and crossing her eyes for
added effect.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Pamela's New Bag: See what a little extra backing can do? At
today's show, Pamela Dennis, now owned by Pegasus Apparel Group,
will unveil the first few pieces of what will become a full-fledged
evening bag collection.
 &HT;    Dennis focuses on delicate barrel, square and frame shapes
crafted in silk satin, lizard and crocodile in classic shades of
black, gunmetal and silver. The complete line will debut during the
November accessories market and hit stores in the spring at prices
ranging from $650 to $1,000.

 By JOANNE RAMEY 
 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    WASHINGTON _ The fashion industry is at it again in the nation's
capital and this time it's Tommy Hilfiger who's helping to make
history.
 &HT;    Hilfiger has agreed to contribute at least $5 million over the
next three years toward the building of a Martin Luther King Jr.
memorial here. His company is the first corporate sponsor to back
the project and at a recent ceremony unveiling the memorial's
design, he and Hilfiger CEO Joel Horowitz weren't short of reasons
why they were eager to participate.
 &HT;    Hilfiger called the slain civil rights leader ``an individual
who had an immeasurable impact on all our lives.'' He said that
through the donation and commitment, he hoped to help raise more
money for the project ``to educate Americans and people around the
world about the life and work of Martin Luther King.''
 &HT;    King's ideals of working for equality through non-violent
protest has contributed to Hilfiger's influences.
 &HT;    ``As a fashion designer, I've always been inspired by America,
by our history, diversity, by youthful and pioneering spirits, our
energy, our ability to be a place of hope and opportunity.''
 &HT;    Horowitz told the audience of about 200 people, including King's
widow, Coretta Scott King, and the Rev. Andrew Young, about how his
parents attended the Aug. 28, 1963, March on Washington where King
delivered his seminal ``I Have a Dream'' speech.
 &HT;    Horowitz's parents were active in the civil rights struggles in
their Lakeview, Long Island, N.Y., town where some white residents
the year before protested desegregation of schools.
 &HT;    ``Many people began to put their homes up for sale. But not my
parents,'' Horowitz said. ``They, along with other white families,
posted signs in front of their homes clearly stating `This house is
not for sale.
 &HT;    ``I can still picture my father today on the front lawn
hammering the sign into the ground.''
 &HT;    Fashion companies are becoming familiar in Washington. Ralph
Lauren donated $13 million to the Smithsonian Institution to
restore Old Glory _ the 187-year-old flag flown over Fort McHenry
in Baltimore, Md., during a battle with the British that inspired
Francis Scott Key to write the poem that became the national
anthem.
 &HT;    A $2.5 million donation by Target Corp. and an additional $4
million in fund-raising efforts helped pay for the $10 million
facelift of the Washington Monument, which reopened this year.
 &HT;    Planning for the King memorial began in 1983. The project went
into high gear two years ago when Congress approved a site on the
National Mall along the Tidal Basin, half way between the Jefferson
Memorial and the Lincoln Memorial where King gave the ``I Have a
Dream'' speech.
 &HT;    An international panel of jurors picked a design for the
memorial submitted by a San Francisco architectural firm. The
winning design by ROMA Design Group was selected from among 900
entrants and will include a rising berm with cascading falls and a
path along which other participants in the civil rights movement
will be commemorated. In the center will be King's profile facing
the Jefferson Memorial.
 &HT;    The designers said they wanted the memorial to embody King's
ideals. In doing so, it makes references to some of his speeches,
such as the ``Mountain of Despair'' and the ``Stone of Hope,'' said
Boris Dramov, a leader of the ROMA design team.
 &HT;    ``We used rough stones to create the entrance and smooth stones
toward the edge of the Tidal Basin to reflect the power of the
movement,'' he said.
 &HT;    ``It is not intended to be about death,'' said Dramov. ``It is
about life and the pursuit of possible human achievement.''
 &HT;    Toward that end, his co-designer and landscape architect Bonnie
Fisher noted that the historic cherry trees encircling the Tidal
Basin, which will serve as a backdrop to the King memorial,
``happen to bloom at the moment of Martin Luther King's death.'' He
was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis.
 &HT;    Coretta Scott King called the memorial ``a uniquely beautiful
and meaningful design'' she hopes won't be altered as the project
is vetted through various panels overseeing the National Mall.
Memorial organizers say they can't estimate yet how much the
project will cost.
 &HT;    In the audience was at least one other fashion figure who said
he's ready to write a check. Designer and record producer Russell
Simmons said the King memorial was the second event he attended
that day. The other was a breakfast with President Clinton
regarding his presidential library.
 &HT;    ``I guess I will be supporting both,'' Simmons said of the
projects.

 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LOS ANGELES _ Running along one side of a dusty, dead-end street
deep in the Valley, there it is: the Beverly Hills Beach Club.
 &HT;    Not really. The striped awning is a prop that's been left
hanging outside the soundstage where Aaron Spelling's ``Beverly
Hills 90210'' was once filmed and which now accommodates his new
production, ``Titans.''
 &HT;    Inside, a couple of neon letters from the old ``Peach Pit'' sign
still cling to the wall, but in the center of the dimly lit expanse
sits a brand new, big, fake Beverly Hills mansion. Its study is
wood-paneled; the living room is prim and chilly and a
double-barreled staircase could accommodate a grand entrance or a
dramatic spill.
 &HT;    It's perfectly Spelling, and though he'd bristle at the thought,
a bit reminiscent of his '80s hit, ``Dynasty.''
 &HT;    But if the ``Titans'' set brings the good old days to mind,
Spelling promises that its fashion won't allude to Nolan Miller's
famously strong-shouldered moment, even though Miller has designed
a wedding dress for the first show.
 &HT;    ``Nolan tells me that they're showing broad-shouldered suits for
women in Paris,'' says Spelling, whose voice on the phone is grave
and has a sassy Hollywood twang. ``But we don't want to be
associated with `Dynasty,' so we won't be showing any. I guarantee,
not one shoulder pad.''
 &HT;    To that end Spelling brought in another former collaborator,
Cathyrn Wagner, who put together the show's jet-setting wardrobe.
 &HT;    Tucked into a corner behind the stately stage, her studio is
bursting with enough campy, vampy and stunning clothes to herald
the dawning of a new era. The get-ups Yasmine Bleeth will don as
Heather Lane during the show's debut season, which kicks off on NBC
at 8 p.m. on Oct. 4, take high-style hysterics to the brink.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, Bleeth's foil, Gwen Williams, played by Victorial
Principal, aims for something a little more chic, swathed in
Giorgio Armani, Ferragamo, Anne Klein and Richard Tyler.
 &HT;    ``Mr. Spelling likes clothing. He likes women and he loves women
dressed up,'' says Wagner, who served previously as the costume
stylist on ''90210.'' ``Sometimes, he'll call and say `What's with
all the leopard, Sweetheart?' But he's fair.''
 &HT;    Just as Wagner won't emulate the ``Dynasty'' look, the clothes
won't say ''90210,'' either. As Wagner likes to put it, she's moved
her shopping off of Melrose Avenue and onto Rodeo Drive.
 &HT;    ``Yasmine's character, Heather, is basically a shop girl who
married way up,'' Wagner says, flipping through Bleeth's bright
rack. ``Now she wants everybody in the universe to see just how
wealthy she is and how well she's done.''
 &HT;    There's the crystal studded Versace top, the new Christian Dior
saddle bag, full-length Pucci gown from episode four, the sequined
logo-print pants by Bottega Veneta, pieces from Dolce &AMP; Gabbana and
Diane Von Furstenberg, a handful of rhinestone belts and vintage
Yves Saint Laurent, all in the gold, red, turquoise and fuchsia
that are the character's hallmark.
 &HT;    The ultimate piece, however, is a tiny mink bikini which is worn
on the show with loads of jewelry and sky-high heels.
 &HT;    ``When we put it together it gets a little tarty,'' Wagner says.
``Heather is very `Valley of the Dolls.' That's how we refer to her
_ but that's the most complimentary name.''
 &HT;    Heather's look is sexy, to be sure. ``Men who don't watch serial
television will be watching,'' says Spelling, who is an executive
producer of the show. ``We couldn't find smaller bathing suits.''
 &HT;    Just don't expect Bleeth to be shown hanging out of said bikini.
``I hate it when you see that,'' he continues. ``Call me square,
but they won't be dressed like sluts.''
 &HT;    Fashion victim might be the more accurate term. ``When we first
spoke, Yasmine said she wanted her character to look like the cover
of Vogue every week,'' Wagner recalls. ``I said `If you do that,
you realize that every once in a while there has to be a zinger _
something that just doesn't work.' And she said `I know, I know!
That's exactly what I want.'''
 &HT;    For the boardroom, it's Emporio Armani's fuchsia jacket and a
pair of white pants, or Tehen's curvy red suit, a Spelling
favorite.
 &HT;    ''`Titans' is about fashion and passion,'' he says.
 &HT;    In fact, he's so passionate about fashion that he preapproves
every costume.
 &HT;    ``I'm a nut about it. You're going to laugh, but before we film
I look over a book of Polaroids showing three different ideas for
each change.''
 &HT;    After all, Bleeth's Heather is the head of Dress2K.com, a
fashion Web site of her very own. In episode three, she even hosts
a runway show, featuring clothes that come courtesy of Nolan
Miller, whose assistant Mark Zanino designed the lot. Miller also
personally designed a wedding dress for Bleeth's character.
 &HT;    For her own part, however, Wagner sticks to shopping. It's what
she does best.
 &HT;    ``There is a lot of great stuff out there. Why design
something?'' she says.
 &HT;    Though she can't discuss her budget, Wagner has been shopping
almost every day since July to supply the 70 or so costume changes
that occur in every episode.
 &HT;    ``At this point, in the shops I sound like a kid collecting
baseball cards: got it, got it, don't got it, don't want it,''
Wagner says, laughing. ``Sometimes Yasmine could have as many as
seven costume changes,'' she adds. ``Of course, one might be naked
under the covers, so it's usually five or six.''
 &HT;    But life could get a whole lot easier for Wagner once the
fashion world tunes in. Bottega Veneta's reps have already sent in
some clothes; ABS lets Wagner pull right from the racks in the
factory downtown and Wagner has struck up a relationship with
Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton.
 &HT;    ``On `90210,' people would give us stuff and I would usually
give them a photo from the show,'' she says. ``I mean a photo of
Yasmine Bleeth wearing your bikini sitting on the table during
market week is going to sell that suit fifty times over.''
 &HT;    Wagner was part of the Armani team who launched A(AT)X on the
West Coast, and she worked at Ralph Lauren as a buyer and for Donna
Karan merchandising, before making the switch to costuming.
 &HT;    In college, however, she majored in acting and had performed in
plays during her high school years in Los Angeles alongside Val
Kilmer and Kevin Spacey, who was also her prom date.
 &HT;    ``This is sort of a synthesis of fashion and theater,'' she
says. ``Clothing can transform an actor into a character.''
 &HT;    Big name designers became interested in gaining screen time for
their wares after ``Sex and the City'' began offering prime-time
placement.
 &HT;    Though Wagner wants to work with designers, she won't risk
sending out anything that might upstage her actors _ like the
glitzy $900 handbags she finds distracting on that show.
 &HT;    ``If the clothing is too exorbitant or too silly, it detracts,''
she says. ``It should be appropriate to the scene and then turned
up a notch. It should be just a little bit better than reality
is.''
 &HT;    And that, of course, is what Spelling is all about.
 &HT;    ``Wait until you see it,'' he concludes. ``You're gonna
scream.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    ALMOST PARADISE
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Where were you in '73?
 &HT;    If you were sitting in your bedroom listening to The Who, Joni
or Yes, you can definitely relate to William Miller, the hero of
Cameron Crowe's semi-autobiographical coming-of-age film, ``Almost
Famous,'' about his experience as a teen-age journalist for Rolling
Stone.
 &HT;    At the recent premiere at the Chelsea West Cinema in Manhattan,
sponsored by the now-venerable music magazine, celebrities of all
ages _ including John Leguizamo, Donovan Leitch, Bebe Neuwirth,
Mariska Hargitay and Fisher Stevens _ heartily applauded the film.
 &HT;    The clapping was certainly music to the ears of Dreamworks
co-head Jeffrey Katzenberg, director Crowe and the performers in
attendance: Billy Crudup (who arrived with gal pal Mary Louise
Parker), Frances McDormand (can you say Oscar nomination?), Philip
Seymour Hoffman (magnificent as always as renegade rock critic
Lester Bangs), Oscar winner Anna Paquin and Patrick Fugit, who
plays Miller.
 &HT;    Especially radiant was leading lady Kate Hudson, who sat next to
her very famous mom, Goldie Hawn. The young actress, who looks like
the love child of Hawn and Drew Barrymore, is a star in the making.
 &HT;    However, one performer _ albeit in a cameo performance as a
taxicab passenger _ was noticeably absent: Rolling Stone founder
Jann Wenner.
 &HT;    After the screening, designer (and noted rock-and-roll fan)
Tommy Hilfiger _ nattily attired in a window-pane suit _ pronounced
the film ``entertaining and engaging.''
 &HT;    ``Third Watch'' hunk Eddie Cibrian was also full of praise. ``I
really liked it even though I was born in 1973,'' he remarked.
 &HT;    Also giving the film high marks at the post-screening party at
Centro-Fly, which was renamed for the evening (but not redecorated)
in honor of the legendary Max's Kansas City, were a gray-bearded
Tim Robbins, who came with stepdaughter Eva Amurri (the spitting
image of mom Susan Sarandon) and Ethan Hawke (minus Uma), who
decided to make a bowling shirt his fashion statement.
 &HT;    Along with film, theater was on the mind of some of the guests:
A decidedly scruffy Kevin Bacon (maybe he was just trying to look
like a rock star?) came with wife Kyra Sedgwick, who is working
``hard, hard, hard'' on ``Stranger,'' a new play that begins
previews later this month at Off-Broadway's Vineyard Theatre.
 &HT;    ``Cabaret's'' new leading lady, former sitcom star Lea Thompson,
was still riding the high of a thunderous ovation at the ``Broadway
on Broadway'' concert in Times Square. ``I was so scared, and I am
so glad it went well. It's such a great part.''
 &HT;    And the ageless Michele Lee, preparing for her return to
Broadway in Charles Busch's hilarious ``The Tale of the Allergist's
Wife,'' confided the show is even better than it was during its
sold-out run earlier this year at Manhattan Theatre Club.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    DIAMONDS IN THE ROUGH
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The Oscars are still many months away, but the fierce battle to
bejewel next year's nominees is already heating up.
 &HT;    In an unprecedented bid to encourage actresses to wear its
baubles at the 2001 Academy Awards ceremony, the Italian jeweler
Bulgari will allow a select number of nominees and presenters to
design their own necklaces.
 &HT;    No word yet on how much leeway the ladies will have with their
designs _ or whether they'll be allowed to keep them _ but the
company is likely to have some fairly stylish necks to adorn. Last
year, its jewels turned up on the likes of Winona Ryder, Chloe
Sevigny and Charlize Theron.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    PRADA NEWS
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Is red the new color at Prada?
 &HT;    Sources say the Italian fashion house is scouting locations for
a party during Paris fashion week to celebrate its new Miu Miu
boutique _ and one of the spots they're considering is none other
than the Communist Party headquarters in the 10th arrondissement, a
futuristic-in-a-'70s-way cement structure by architect Oscar
Niemeyer.
 &HT;    It would be a fitting choice, given that Miuccia Prada was once
an ardent left-winger.
 &HT;    Although Prada declined to confirm that location, a spokeswoman
assured it would choose a venue based on its architecture, not its
politics.

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ On one of the more anticipated night of
track and field at the Sydney Games, Michael Johnson won his second
gold medal in the men's 400 meters and Cathy Freeman stopped a
nation in the women's 400. Stacy Dragila won the inaugural women's
pole vault and tossed a bouquet of flowers over her shoulder like a
bride at her reception. Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia ran 6.2
miles and had to lean like a sprinter at the tape to defeat his
nemesis, Paul Tergat of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   But amid these accomplishments, the Summer Games again found
themselves engulfed in a drug scandal, one that has snared the
husband of the sprinter Marion Jones and has inevitably added
stress and suspicion to her attempt to become the first female
track and field athlete to win five gold medals in one Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' husband, C.J. Hunter, the 1999 world champion in the shot
put, tested positive for the banned steroid nandrolone at a track
meet in Oslo, Norway, on July 28, track and field's world governing
body said Monday. Hunter, who had withdrawn before the Games
started after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery, denied the
allegations in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But the news competed with the stirring performances of those
athletes who ran and hurdled and vaulted Monday night to the
riveting enjoyment of 112,524 people at Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   At least one compelling moment _ the women's 400 meters _
transcended the blemish of drugs. Freeman has managed the difficult
balance of being an exceedingly talented and popular athlete, as
well as a political symbol who has forced Australia to publicly
face the marginalizing of its Aboriginal people. Her own
grandmother was part of the so-called stolen generation, taken from
her family and uncertain of her age or birthday.
</P>
<P>
   During the opening ceremony, Freeman lit the Olympic caldron in
a moment that was widely viewed as an important gesture toward
national reconciliation. As her name was announced before Monday
night's race, cameras flashed like strobe lights through the
stadium and the roar for her was thunderous.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on her to win was enormous. Australia's track and
field stars cannot match the achievements of its swimmers. Freeman
was the only real hope for a gold medal. She wore a hooded bodysuit
that made her seem more like a speedskater than a sprinter, and the
crowd seemed to carry her on a smooth glide around the track.
</P>
<P>
   In the final turn, Freeman lost her form and her head began to
wobble and her arms began to flail. All that was left, really, was
sheer determination. This indelible will carried her down the
homestretch and allowed her to draw away from Lorraine Graham of
Jamaica in the final 50 meters to win in 49.11 seconds. Exhausted
from the race and the expectation, Freeman sat on the ground for a
full two minutes before she removed her shoes and took a victory
walk around the stadium, handing flowers to her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could feel the crowd around me, all over me,'' Freeman said.
``I felt everybody's emotion. Happiness and joy absorbed into every
pore of my body. I had to sit down to make myself feel normal and
get comfortable. It was beyond words.''
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   She wore spikes in the Aboriginal colors of red for the earth,
yellow for the sky and black for the people. And after she won,
Freeman grabbed both the Australian and Aboriginal flags and wore
them over her shoulder like a shawl. As a symbol, she said she
hoped her achievement ``will make a difference in people's
attitudes.'' But this victory's value was mostly in its personal
currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased that I withstood the pressure and won the gold
medal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 400, Johnson became the first man ever to win the
quarter mile in consecutive Olympics, establishing a dominance not
evident in any other event with his victory in 43.84 seconds. Over
the past 11 years, Johnson has run this race 82 times and has won
79 times. He ran a controlled sprint Monday night, starting
patiently with his upright style and low knee lift. But, as usual,
he took a wide lead coming out of the final turn and was never
threatened by his teammate Alvin Harrison, who won the silver medal
in 44.40.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   A cool night in an outside lane was no time to challenge his
world record of 43.18 seconds, Johnson said. His victory was
conservative but definitive and historic.
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   ``He's kind of like a gunslinger who snookered the others to
look into the sun,'' said Clyde Hart, Johnson's longtime coach.
``You don't need to be quite as fast.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Johnson will anchor the U.S. 800-meter relay team
and should win his fifth career gold medal. With a double victory
in the 200 and 400 meters at the Atlanta Games, world records in
both events and a second gold in the quarter mile Monday night, he
cemented his position as second only to Carl Lewis among the great
sprinters of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing we set out to accomplish that we didn't
do,'' Johnson said of himself and Hart. This was a night for
deserved self-indulgence, not drug scandals, Johnson said. ``I
think I should be allowed to be selfish and concentrate on the
history I've been able to make, instead of what might be
overshadowing it back home.''
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIML
</P>
<P>
   A shot putter failing a drug test would not generally be a huge
story. Many shot putters have failed drug tests. At the 1992 Summer
Games in Barcelona, Spain, all three medalists had previously been
caught cheating.
</P>
<P>
   On most nights, the stories would focus on athletes like
Gebrselassie and his desperate sprint to win the 10,000 meters by
nine hundredths of a second in 27 minutes 18.20 seconds. Or Maria
Mutola, discovered in Mozambique by a poet while she played soccer,
granted an Olympic scholarship to attend high school in
Springfield, Ore. After a career of frustration, she finally won a
gold medal Monday night in the 800 meters in 1:56.15.
</P>
<P>
   On most nights, the victory by Anier Garcia of Cuba in the
110-meter hurdles would make headlines because he upset the
defending champion, Allen Johnson of the United States, in 13
seconds, a national record. Or Gabriela Szabo of Romania, the frail
runner with the muscular kick, would grab attention with her
victory in the 5,000 meters in 14:40.79, an Olympic record.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday night was not most nights. Hunter was big news
because his wife is Marion Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Marion Jones, who cares about this fat man?'' said
Giorgio Reineri, a spokesman for track and field's world governing
body.
</P>
<P>
   Drug scandals involving the withdrawal of 27 Chinese athletes
and the expulsion of weightlifting teams from Romania and Bulgaria
have already rocked these Games. Swimming's flurry of world records
was tempered by drug suspicions in many races. Athletes talk openly
of drugs now the way they once talked of sprained ankles. Drug
testing is so deficient that no tests exist for many of the drugs
athletes are believed to be using. In swimming and track and field,
every remarkable performance brings not wonder but immediate
distrust.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot away from what we're doing, the clean athletes
that are working hard at what they do every day,'' said Dragila of
Pocatello, Idaho, who won the first women's Olympic pole vault at
15 feet 1 inch. ``I hope that it doesn't tarnish what we've
accomplished. I know that I'm clean and that I earned it.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Masback, the chief executive officer of the United States
track and field federation, said, ``No one really knew how clean
other Olympics were and no one really knows how clean this is.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fair or not, Jones will face some skepticism as she attempts to
win four more gold medals in the 200 meters, long jump, 400-meter
relay and 1600-meter relay after Saturday's victory at 100 meters.
She has not been accused, and she has not failed a drug test.
Still, this does not keep other athletes from a despairing parlor
game of cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are married to someone taking drugs, it would be
surprising not to know about it,'' said Erica Johansson of Sweden,
who will compete against Jones in the long jump, beginning
Wednesday. ``I don't think she's doping, but she will live with
this the rest of her career. Whatever result she has from now on,
everyone will wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   Rightly or wrongly, Jones is certain to hear some of the same
questions that the swimmer Michelle Smith of Ireland heard at the
Atlanta Games, in part because her husband, Erik de Bruin, a discus
thrower, had been suspended for steroid use. Smith won three gold
medals in swimming, but was banned last year after spiking a drug
test with alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope she can do this without interference,'' Gerhard
Heiberg, an member of the International Olympic Committee from
Norway, said of Jones. ``I know some people will speculate. I hope
she's clean and she can do her best.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement of Hunter's positive test was curious on a
couple of levels. One, the suspected drug, nandrolone, has been
readily detectable for years, and officials have been surprised
that a flurry of positive tests for the drug have occurred in the
past year. One possible explanation is improperly labeled
nutritional substances, scientists said. Also, the announcement was
viewed as an irritated reaction by the IOC to relentless criticism
that has come from the United States Congress, White House,
corporate sponsors and media in regard to corruption in the Salt
Lake City bidding scandal and inadequacies in drug testing.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates of the IOC have raised the possibility of covered-up
drug tests by the U.S. track and field officials. Masback issued a
vehement denial, saying the U.S. federation was the world leader in
drug testing. Still, the IOC sent an unmistakable message that the
United States needs to clean up its own house before calling others
dirty on the issue of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like alcoholism - you first have to admit that there is a
problem before you can get around to solving it,'' said Dick Pound,
an IOC delegate from Montreal and the chairman of its World
Anti-Doping Agency. ``If one is in constant denial, there is no
chance of recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   The attention will turn now to Jones, as she runs two rounds of
the 200 on Wednesday and attempts to qualify for the long jump
final. Can she still win five golds? Will the anxiety from her
husband's troubles sabotage her own ambitions?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe she is stronger than the problem,'' Reineri said. ``I
hope so for her. She's a winner. She doesn't deserve the stories
swirling around her. She's a nice woman, a great athlete. It's a
pity. This guy is her husband. Obviously for her it's a big
problem. It can be a tragedy. We hope she is strong enough to beat
this tragedy like she beats the other athletes on the track.''  &QL;

HALLWAY HUGS LAND TWO GIRLS IN DETENTION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By GINA AUGUSTINI BEST 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EULESS, Texas _ Euless Junior High School recently punished two
girls for hugging each other in the hallway _ something the
students say should be allowed and that lots of girls do.
</P>
<P>
   Principal David Robbins says such physical contact is
inappropriate in school because it could lead to other things.
Robbins said he stands by his rule that no students should hug in
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, in junior high, they just don't need to put their
hands on each other because they can get into trouble,'' Robbins
said last week.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the disagreement appears to be the intent of the
girls' hugs.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, while not naming the students, described one of the
hugs as a ``sexual encounter'' because the girls ``were fronted up,
body to body.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that hugging in school increases the chances of
inappropriate touching and creates peer pressure for students who
may not want that type of contact.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth-graders who were punished for hugging, Le'Von
Daugherty, 15, and Heather Culps, 14, say they are like sisters and
often hug to comfort each other or to show support. They said the
hugs were not sexual.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all just hug each other. All the girls do anyway,'' Culps
said.
</P>
<P>
   The girls were given detention slips Aug. 30 after a teacher saw
them hugging in front of Daugherty's locker. On Sept. 15, Daugherty
was sent to the principal's office after being seen hugging Culps
again in front of her locker. The first hug was for good luck
before a test, and the second hug was to comfort an upset
Daugherty, the girls said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I should be punished for hugging my friend.
That's ridiculous. We shouldn't be punished for making each other
feel good,'' Daugherty said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like we were groping each other,'' Culps said. ``I
think it's pretty outrageous to go that far. ... It doesn't make
any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Culps, who said she often hugs teachers at Euless Junior High
School, said she cannot understand how it is appropriate to hug
them but not her friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to make a big argument,'' Culps said. ``I'm
just standing up for what I believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   Daugherty said she is writing a letter and plans to bring up the
issue with the Hurst-Euless-Bedford school board.
</P>
<P>
   Student codes of conduct in H-E-B and other area school
districts have vague rules regarding physical contact such as
hugging and appear to allow for educators' interpretation of the
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Hugging is not listed as an offense in the H-E-B 2000-2001
Student Code of Conduct. But it could be considered ``exhibiting
inappropriate familiarity,'' considered a Level 1 misbehavior in
the code, said Dianne Byrnes, district director of alternative
education programs. Byrnes oversees the Student Code of Conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things have to do with if somebody took offense,''
she said about interpreting the code of conduct. ``There's always
another side to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Discipline for a Level 1 offense in the H-E-B code of conduct
includes options such as detention, meeting with a counselor,
losing privileges or conferring with a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Byrnes said schools can set specific rules for their campuses,
but they must be in compliance with the district code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The Euless Junior High School student handbook does not list
hugging as misbehavior, Robbins said, but students are given
multiple warnings before they are punished for it.
</P>
<P>
   The girls received detention after the first hugging incident on
Aug. 30. Culps' detention slip stated her offense as ``hugging
another student after being told that hugging is against school
rules.'' Daugherty, who said she argued with the teacher about the
detention, was written up for being ``defiant'' and ``not doing
what the teacher said to do.''
</P>
<P>
   After the second hugging incident, Daugherty was sent to the
principal's office for arguing with a teacher. She received a
Saturday detention for being ``rude, discourteous'' and ``arguing
with the teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Culps did not receive detention for the second hugging incident.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins said there had been no other hugging incidents between
girls on campus this year. There have been two incidents in which
boys and girls were hugging and students had been punished, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said it is ``not an extreme problem'' at Euless Junior
High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see anyone running around here saying, `Let's clamp
down on hugging,''' Robbins said.
</P>
<P>
   Daugherty's mother, Margaret Daugherty, said that she supports
her daughter's stance and considers Culps part of the family _ and
hugs her, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a boy and a girl can walk down the hall holding hands and
not get into trouble, then they shouldn't get into trouble for
giving a small hug. I can't see any harm in it,'' Margaret
Daugherty said. ``When I was going to school, I had sisters there,
and we would hug. What about family members? Can they hug?''
</P>
<P>
   Daugherty's parents home-schooled her last year after an
incident in which they believed that their daughter had been
disciplined unfairly, Margaret Daugherty said. In that case, Le'Von
Daugherty wore her father's jacket to school and was punished
because there were cigarettes in it.
</P>
<P>
   Other H-E-B schools also discourage hugging, but for different
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Central Junior High School in Euless does not have a specific
rule against hugging, but teachers dissuade students from embracing
in the hallways, Principal June Jacoby said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not like it because it prevents them from getting to
class on time,'' Jacoby said, adding that teachers will break up
students hugging in the hallways and send them on their way.
</P>
<P>
   Other school districts have differing policies about handling
hugging.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Simpson, assistant deputy superintendent in the Keller
school district, said the rules could vary at each campus and would
depend on the situation. She said her guess would be that nothing
would be done to students exchanging friendly embraces or ``hello
hugs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you have an embrace, a real affectionate `love' hug,
then we would talk to the students about that,'' Simpson said.
``There's a difference between a `hello' hug and a `hello, baby'
hug.''
</P>
<P>
   The Birdville school district student code of conduct does not
include a rule regarding hugging. District spokesman Mark Thomas
said he was unsure how hugging would be handled in Birdville
schools. Each campus has flexibility in setting rules, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Callie Hearne, who investigates sexual harassment cases in the
H-E-B district, said it is sometimes difficult for the public to
understand why school administrators enforce certain rules. The
main objective of a principal and an assistant principal is to
ensure that schools are a safe environment and are free of
disruption, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the public might not think some of these things are
disruptive, but they may have to be addressed,'' Hearne said.

&HT;     POLL SHOWS FEINSTEIN WITH BIG LEAD OVER GOP CANDIDATE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC BRAZIL  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein holds a
commanding lead over the Republican candidate who is trying to
unseat her, according to a poll released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The survey conducted for the San Francisco Examiner and KTVU
television showed Feinstein favored by 53 percent of those
surveyed, while Rep. Tom Campbell of San Jose trailed with 36
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 820 likely California voters was taken Sept. 17-20
by Research 2000 of Rockville, Md. The margin of error is plus or
minus 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   While trailing in the polls, Campbell's bid for the Senate has
increased his name recognition. In May 1999, when Research 2000
began polling the race, Feinstein's edge was 57 percent to 35
percent, and just 38 percent of the voters recognized Campbell. His
recognition factor in the new poll is 83 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also disclosed that Feinstein's popularity rating was
54 percent favorable, 36 percent unfavorable, 10 percent neutral.
When the campaign began, 57 percent of the voters viewed her
favorably.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks pretty difficult for Campbell at this point,'' said
Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a senior associate at the Center for Politics
and Economics at the Claremont University graduate school. ``If he
has any hope, it's that (Feinstein) will have to tumble, and that
isn't likely. She's popular and she's savvy.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, 48, who represents the San Jose area, had a 28 to 23
percent favorable-unfavorable rating, but 49 percent of those
surveyed still have no opinion about him or don't know who he is.
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed that Feinstein runs strongest among women (60 to
29 percent), blacks (88 to 6 percent) and in the San Francisco area
(69 to 23 percent). Feinstein is a former mayor of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell is close only among men (43 to 46 percent) and in
California's Central Valley (44 to 45 percent) and Southern
California, excluding Los Angeles (43 to 44 percent).
</P>
<P>
   To undermine Feinstein's favorable image, Campbell would have to
launch an aggressive negative campaign _ as did former Rep. Michael
Huffington in his 1994 contest with her _ said Mark Petracca, a
professor of political science at the University of California at
Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the fact of the matter is that Campbell is too much of an
intellectual, too good a person to do that,'' Petracca said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One cost-free, integrity-preserving strategy that Campbell
would pursue is to engage in some showboatism _ he could get a lot
of free press if he wants to start patting himself on the back
publicly. But that requires the kind of ego I'm not sure he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, 67, a former two-term mayor of San Francisco, has
served in the U.S. Senate since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell served in the House of Representatives from 1988 to
1992, lost a bid for the Republican U.S. Senate nomination to Bruce
Herschenson _ who subsequently lost to Sen. Barbara Boxer _ served
a term in the state Senate and was re-elected to the House in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Citrin, a political science professor at the University of
California at Berkeley, said Campbell ``is in a difficult
situation'' because Feinstein is a moderate and not overly
partisan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campbell's an intelligent man, and in another kind of
situation he might be the stronger candidate,'' Citrin said.

(EDS: SIDEBAR TO `HANA' STORY) 
By ERIC NOLAND 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAILUKU, Hawaii -- Hawaii is a place of unsurpassed beauty,
simplicity and peace, such that tourists caught up in its tropical
caress can easily be lulled into a false sense of security. The
islands are not, however, exempt from the same human evil that
infects urban areas on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   A young couple from Studio City learned this in excruciating
fashion this past spring. Total cost of the lesson: $8,000, and a
vacation that was utterly ruined.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Fox and Walter Lang, making their first trip to Hawaii,
opted for a one-week stay in Maui. On their first full day on the
island, they arose well before dawn to undertake a popular tourist
activity -- biking down the Haleakala volcano. They parked their
convertible rental car in a shopping center lot at the bike tour
company's office in the Paia-Haiku area, on the northeastern side
of the island.
</P>
<P>
   But before boarding the vans for the ride to the top of the
mountain, they made a fateful mistake: They locked valuables in the
trunk of their car, notably a wallet and a condo key.
</P>
<P>
   Upon returning to their car in the late morning, they discovered
it had been broken into and vandalized. But the nightmare was only
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The thieves, who apparently hit the car right after the vans
left, drove to the couple's condominium in Kihei and ransacked it,
taking everything _ laptop computer, Palm Pilots, camera, gifts,
clothes, shoes, toiletries, makeup, luggage. From the condo itself,
the VCR, microwave oven and even the phone were gone.
</P>
<P>
   Then, throughout the morning, while Fox and Lang were blissfully
pedaling down the mountain -- and before they could notify banks
and credit-card companies of the break-in -- the thieves went on a
shopping spree, writing checks, using credit cards. They even
bought a full set of tires for a truck.
</P>
<P>
   Fox and Lang were devastated. They had to have money wired and
an emergency Visa account set up (having to wait two days for the
new card to reach them). They had to buy clothes and toothpaste and
combs. ``It was so emotionally violating,'' said Fox, who noted
that even as they went about other tourist activities, she found
herself looking to see if people they encountered were wearing her
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``We went there because we were overworked and needed
a break and needed a little romance and a break from all the
stress. It wasn't that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Jon Morioka, a spokesman for the Maui Police Dept.,
acknowledged that vehicle break-ins are a common crime against
tourists on the island, but he declined to provide figures on the
matter -- other than to say incidences have declined in recent
years with the deployment of citizens' patrols of problem areas.
</P>
<P>
   Morioka noted that prevention is one of the most important steps
an island visitor can take -- ``not locking valuables in the
vehicle, making sure you take only what you need for your
excursion; not taking your whole household with you, locking the
rest in the hotel safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Hawaii-bound travelers might not be able to prevent the
kind of calamity that Fox and Lang encountered, but steps can be
taken to substantially reduce risk.
</P>
<P>
   In Maui's remote beach areas, signs are posted about not leaving
valuables in your car. As Morioka noted, heed them. ``You see those
signs,'' said Fox, ``but on your first time in Hawaii, something
inside you gets caught up in the magnificence of it all. We were in
a dream-like state.''
</P>
<P>
   The implicit challenge is in protecting your valuables without
denying yourself many of the natural pleasures of the islands.
Hiking in the rain forest and snorkeling in the warm, pristine
waters tend to be unforgettable experiences, but both often require
you to park at a deserted turnout.
</P>
<P>
   And tourist vehicles are easily identified in the islands.
They're late-model, sparkling-clean (with no signs of rust or mud),
and generally white or red.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   -- First of all, scale down your store of valuables before you
leave the mainland. If possible, take just one credit card apiece,
an ATM card, and maybe one gasoline card, if possible, and leave
the rest at home. Don't bring along a lot of expensive jewelry
(restaurants in Hawaii are unfailingly casual). You shouldn't need
your checkbook (maybe just a spare check or two). Leave the
expensive electronic devices at home, if you can live without them.
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't bring along a vast reserve of cash. Even if you don't
want to bother with travelers' checks, you can reload on cash
frequently at numerous ATM machines around the islands.
</P>
<P>
   -- Invest in a couple of nylon fanny packs and some
freezer-strength zip plastic bags. Consider one fanny pack your
``dry'' pack and the other your ``wet'' pack. Then, on any day
trip, take along only essential items. (If you're staying in a
hotel with a room safe -- many have them -- lock all remaining
valuables in it.)
</P>
<P>
   If you embark on a day trip that will involve hiking to
waterfalls and also snorkeling at a beach -- the drive to Hana, for
example -- leave your lodgings with only select valuables: driver's
license, room key, car key, a couple of credit cards, some cash.
</P>
<P>
   For a hike or a bike trip, place these items in the dry fanny
pack and leave nothing in the car more valuable than a beach towel,
your picnic lunch and an ice chest. Later, for a swim, transfer
your valuables -- including your eyeglasses or sunglasses, if
applicable -- to the plastic zip bags. Place them in the wet pack,
strap it around your waist (be sure to zip it closed securely) and
head into the water, leaving nothing important in the car, on the
beach or in a snorkel-tour boat.
</P>
<P>
   You may get funny looks from other swimmers and the fish, but
your mind will be at rest. Afterward, the nylon wet pack should dry
quickly if laid out in the sun or in the trunk of the car.
</P>
<P>
   Another thought: You might want to put wedding rings or other
valuable rings in a zip plastic bag when you swim. Greg Thomas of
the Paragon snorkel outfitter said rings can slip off when fingers
get cool and shrink up in the water, and once a ring settles into
the exotica of the coral bed, you'll be hard-pressed to find it.
</P>
<P>
   -- Obviously, this system won't work for a large, bulky,
expensive camera. The solution: Leave it behind in your lodgings if
you know you're going to be swimming or snorkeling. You can always
save the good camera for an evening luau or a simple sightseeing
drive, where you can make sure it's always with you.
</P>
<P>
   For the beach trips, consider picking up a disposable camera _
or, better yet, an underwater disposable camera (they work for
shots on land, too).
</P>
<P>
   -- Another idea is to bring a spare key chain from home and
transfer your condo key to it. That way, if it's misplaced or
stolen, the person in possession of it won't have the name of your
condo complex and your unit number.
</P>
<P>
   None of these precautions will guarantee a safe trip. Rooms can
still be broken into. Tourists can still be robbed at gunpoint _ it
has happened on the hiking trail to Sacred Falls, on Oahu's
windward shore. But they can substantially reduce the severity of
losses in a car burglary.
</P>
<P>
   The measures would certainly have prevented Fox and Lang from
having such a disastrous vacation.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of their travails, however, the two were encouraged
after encountering some Good Samaritans.
</P>
<P>
   The people at the Old Lahaina Luau heard of their ordeal _ and
learned that they had no immediate means of paying for the feast
they had reserved. Fox: ``They said, `Why don't you just come and
be our guests.''' Meanwhile, the proprietor at Maui Jim's broke
into tears at their story, Fox said, and began giving them
sunglasses, shirts, T-shirts and a dinner certificate.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while experiencing the dark side of paradise, Fox and Lang
also encountered its aloha. &QL;

   WAILUKU, Hawaii -- Hawaii is a place of unsurpassed beauty,
simplicity and peace, such that tourists caught up in its tropical
caress can easily be lulled into a false sense of security. The
islands are not, however, exempt from the same human evil that
infects urban areas on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   A young couple from Studio City learned this in excruciating
fashion this past spring. Total cost of the lesson: $8,000, and a
vacation that was utterly ruined.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Fox and Walter Lang, making their first trip to Hawaii,
opted for a one-week stay in Maui. On their first full day on the
island, they arose well before dawn to undertake a popular tourist
activity -- biking down the Haleakala volcano. They parked their
convertible rental car in a shopping center lot at the bike tour
company's office in the Paia-Haiku area, on the northeastern side
of the island.
</P>
<P>
   But before boarding the vans for the ride to the top of the
mountain, they made a fateful mistake: They locked valuables in the
trunk of their car, notably a wallet and a condo key.
</P>
<P>
   Upon returning to their car in the late morning, they discovered
it had been broken into and vandalized. But the nightmare was only
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The thieves, who apparently hit the car right after the vans
left, drove to the couple's condominium in Kihei and ransacked it,
taking everything _ laptop computer, Palm Pilots, camera, gifts,
clothes, shoes, toiletries, makeup, luggage. From the condo itself,
the VCR, microwave oven and even the phone were gone.
</P>
<P>
   Then, throughout the morning, while Fox and Lang were blissfully
pedaling down the mountain -- and before they could notify banks
and credit-card companies of the break-in -- the thieves went on a
shopping spree, writing checks, using credit cards. They even
bought a full set of tires for a truck.
</P>
<P>
   Fox and Lang were devastated. They had to have money wired and
an emergency Visa account set up (having to wait two days for the
new card to reach them). They had to buy clothes and toothpaste and
combs. ``It was so emotionally violating,'' said Fox, who noted
that even as they went about other tourist activities, she found
herself looking to see if people they encountered were wearing her
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``We went there because we were overworked and needed
a break and needed a little romance and a break from all the
stress. It wasn't that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Jon Morioka, a spokesman for the Maui Police Dept.,
acknowledged that vehicle break-ins are a common crime against
tourists on the island, but he declined to provide figures on the
matter -- other than to say incidences have declined in recent
years with the deployment of citizens' patrols of problem areas.
</P>
<P>
   Morioka noted that prevention is one of the most important steps
an island visitor can take -- ``not locking valuables in the
vehicle, making sure you take only what you need for your
excursion; not taking your whole household with you, locking the
rest in the hotel safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Hawaii-bound travelers might not be able to prevent the
kind of calamity that Fox and Lang encountered, but steps can be
taken to substantially reduce risk.
</P>
<P>
   In Maui's remote beach areas, signs are posted about not leaving
valuables in your car. As Morioka noted, heed them. ``You see those
signs,'' said Fox, ``but on your first time in Hawaii, something
inside you gets caught up in the magnificence of it all. We were in
a dream-like state.''
</P>
<P>
   The implicit challenge is in protecting your valuables without
denying yourself many of the natural pleasures of the islands.
Hiking in the rain forest and snorkeling in the warm, pristine
waters tend to be unforgettable experiences, but both often require
you to park at a deserted turnout.
</P>
<P>
   And tourist vehicles are easily identified in the islands.
They're late-model, sparkling-clean (with no signs of rust or mud),
and generally white or red.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   -- First of all, scale down your store of valuables before you
leave the mainland. If possible, take just one credit card apiece,
an ATM card, and maybe one gasoline card, if possible, and leave
the rest at home. Don't bring along a lot of expensive jewelry
(restaurants in Hawaii are unfailingly casual). You shouldn't need
your checkbook (maybe just a spare check or two). Leave the
expensive electronic devices at home, if you can live without them.
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't bring along a vast reserve of cash. Even if you don't
want to bother with travelers' checks, you can reload on cash
frequently at numerous ATM machines around the islands.
</P>
<P>
   -- Invest in a couple of nylon fanny packs and some
freezer-strength zip plastic bags. Consider one fanny pack your
``dry'' pack and the other your ``wet'' pack. Then, on any day
trip, take along only essential items. (If you're staying in a
hotel with a room safe -- many have them -- lock all remaining
valuables in it.)
</P>
<P>
   If you embark on a day trip that will involve hiking to
waterfalls and also snorkeling at a beach -- the drive to Hana, for
example -- leave your lodgings with only select valuables: driver's
license, room key, car key, a couple of credit cards, some cash.
</P>
<P>
   For a hike or a bike trip, place these items in the dry fanny
pack and leave nothing in the car more valuable than a beach towel,
your picnic lunch and an ice chest. Later, for a swim, transfer
your valuables -- including your eyeglasses or sunglasses, if
applicable -- to the plastic zip bags. Place them in the wet pack,
strap it around your waist (be sure to zip it closed securely) and
head into the water, leaving nothing important in the car, on the
beach or in a snorkel-tour boat.
</P>
<P>
   You may get funny looks from other swimmers and the fish, but
your mind will be at rest. Afterward, the nylon wet pack should dry
quickly if laid out in the sun or in the trunk of the car.
</P>
<P>
   Another thought: You might want to put wedding rings or other
valuable rings in a zip plastic bag when you swim. Greg Thomas of
the Paragon snorkel outfitter said rings can slip off when fingers
get cool and shrink up in the water, and once a ring settles into
the exotica of the coral bed, you'll be hard-pressed to find it.
</P>
<P>
   -- Obviously, this system won't work for a large, bulky,
expensive camera. The solution: Leave it behind in your lodgings if
you know you're going to be swimming or snorkeling. You can always
save the good camera for an evening luau or a simple sightseeing
drive, where you can make sure it's always with you.
</P>
<P>
   For the beach trips, consider picking up a disposable camera _
or, better yet, an underwater disposable camera (they work for
shots on land, too).
</P>
<P>
   -- Another idea is to bring a spare key chain from home and
transfer your condo key to it. That way, if it's misplaced or
stolen, the person in possession of it won't have the name of your
condo complex and your unit number.
</P>
<P>
   None of these precautions will guarantee a safe trip. Rooms can
still be broken into. Tourists can still be robbed at gunpoint _ it
has happened on the hiking trail to Sacred Falls, on Oahu's
windward shore. But they can substantially reduce the severity of
losses in a car burglary.
</P>
<P>
   The measures would certainly have prevented Fox and Lang from
having such a disastrous vacation.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of their travails, however, the two were encouraged
after encountering some Good Samaritans.
</P>
<P>
   The people at the Old Lahaina Luau heard of their ordeal _ and
learned that they had no immediate means of paying for the feast
they had reserved. Fox: ``They said, `Why don't you just come and
be our guests.''' Meanwhile, the proprietor at Maui Jim's broke
into tears at their story, Fox said, and began giving them
sunglasses, shirts, T-shirts and a dinner certificate.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while experiencing the dark side of paradise, Fox and Lang
also encountered its aloha. &QL;

SPORTS OF THE TIMES COLUMN: RAINING ON HER REIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The Olympics continued here Monday night,
despite the revelation that Marion Jones' husband had joined a
thousand Bulgarian weight lifters in the holding pen for drug
cheats who claim the laboratory lied.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Freeman enthralled two nations, Australia and the
indigenous Aborigines who wallow beneath its standard of living.
Michael Johnson ran in the shadow of others as dynamically as he
had in the spotlight of Atlanta. The American Stacy Dragila became
the first woman to claim pole-vaulting gold, on a night track and
field managed to soar above the sordid matter of C.J. Hunter's
announced failed drug test at a meet in Norway last July.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad thing is that we're here for something other than
sport,'' Craig Masback, the chief operating officer of USA Track &AMP;
Field had said earlier in the night. ``And the challenge facing
Marion Jones has only been made more challenging by the
developments here.''
</P>
<P>
   This was one of the few unadulterated comments he made at a news
conference clearly striving for triage, not triumph. Under the
circumstances, sitting in front of a couple of hundred skeptics in
the middle of a public relations boondoggle, what could Masback
really say?
</P>
<P>
   How does anyone who saw in Jones the quintessential American
star when she won the 100 meters last Saturday night take a second
look when she returns to the track Wednesday without noticing a
little bloom off the rose? It will be the understandable human
reaction, given what we know about Hunter, her husband, her career
director and spiritual guide.
</P>
<P>
   Yet barring further announcements or International Amateur
Athletic Federation outings, our editing process between mind and
mouth should be on 24-hour alert, lest we make a huge leap worthy
of a medal. Before we begin making character indictment by
association, before we declare anyone a blemished phenomenon just
as she has gotten off the block, let us remind ourselves that
Hillary Clinton is running for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   On that note, regardless of what her husband has been caught
doing and what the imagination might conjure up about Jones, she
can still have America's blessings as she goes for more gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of the recent situation, I hope she'll be able to
continue to focus on what she's here to do,'' Johnson said in quite
the statesmanlike manner after winning the men's 400 meters in
Olympic Stadium in front of more than 112,000 people. ``Hopefully,
all of you will allow her to focus on what she's here to do.''
</P>
<P>
   We as a nation have done it before, paused for reflection after
revelation, upon learning two summers ago that Mark McGwire was
hammering his way toward the baseball record book with the aid of
little bottled helpers. McGwire wasn't breaking baseball's drug
rules, but that was because baseball didn't have any. He was, on
the other hand, participating in and essentially promoting
pharmacology, the plague of performance enhancement, and isn't that
where the credibility gap in the Olympics lies?
</P>
<P>
   America wasn't ready to take down a man in the process of
rewriting the storybook of our long, lost youth, so McGwire got a
free pass, a deferred trial for when androstenedione is as widely
denounced in the States as it happens to be here.
</P>
<P>
   It has always been easier for Americans to heap scorn on
Olympians, these disposable heroes, whom we only look to every four
years. As sports ethicists, we have a shifting set of standards, a
selective morality. ``How can we believe anything we see here?'' is
what you kept hearing around the news media center Monday night.
Fair question, but we will also go home next week to watch baseball
players, who may well be mixing steroids with their Cracker Jack,
for all we know. No one cries to shut the parks down, but when it
comes to the Olympics, we are still demanding purity from a
movement that long ago lost its innocence, no matter what the
mythmakers and marketers claim.
</P>
<P>
   The world has grown tired of our high-mindedness, our appointed
commissions, with their how-to manuals for a kinder, cleaner
Olympics. That explains the released test results for nandrolone
and testosterone Hunter was said to have failed in Oslo not long
after he passed the same tests at the U.S. trials in July,
according to Masback. The message came through loud and clear, and
was echoed Monday by a variety of international sources: Shut up
and clean up your own house.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, the world champion in the shot put, cited a knee injury
when he withdrew from the U.S. team. He said Monday that he would
``vigorously'' contest the report, but he's not competing here, and
at this point he is merely the husband who has rained on his wife's
reign.
</P>
<P>
   As with many track and field stars, there have been whispers
about Marion Jones, but she isn't Michelle Smith, the swimmer who
married a doper and became a sensation overnight. Suspicion isn't
fact, and the fact is that Jones has been a blur since she was 10.
Now she has this controversy to run from, as she goes for more
gold.
</P>
<P>
   The important thing to remember: Until proven otherwise, it's
not of her doing. &QL;

MAUI'S VILLAGE OF HANA A BREATHTAKING STOP

<P>
   HANA, Hawaii -- Around 5 p.m. Or maybe 6. That's when you begin
to notice a subtle shift in the town's personality.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the last rental cars pull out of Hana, the
unpretentious little village on the southeastern edge of the
Hawaiian island of Maui. You see the drivers glance impatiently at
their watches, then pick up speed a little as they head for the
first of 56 bridges, the first of 617 curves on the infamous Hana
Highway that will be their route out.
</P>
<P>
   It's then that Hana ceases to be a midday tourist refueling stop
and regains its truer identity.
</P>
<P>
   A softball game begins on an emerald-green field across from the
school, the very young or very old hopping onto the hoods of parked
cars to watch the action and heckle the participants. A grill leaps
to flaming life down on the beach of Hana Bay, as the day's catch
is readied for dinner. Siblings squeal with excitement as they ride
their bikes toward Hasegawa General Store in hopes of getting there
before it closes at 6:30.
</P>
<P>
   As the night descends, there will be no streetlights to defile
it. And at some point, all sound is destined to be muffled by a
sudden cloudburst.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Hana -- this is the Hawaii -- that few visitors
experience. Reams have been written about a drive on the Hana
Highway, that 51-mile scenic wonder that perches precariously along
the lush, nearly vertical eastern slope of Maui's Haleakala
volcano. But almost all of it is presented in the context of a day
trip, and that's how it is treated by the majority of visitors
staying in the resort enclaves of Kaanapali or Wailea.
</P>
<P>
   They hop into their rental cars at mid-morning and begin bending
around the 10-mph curves and over the quaint, one-lane bridges,
marveling at each waterfall, each neon-orange burst of African
tulip blossom, each sweeping vista of the cobalt-blue Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Then they make the briefest of stops in Hana (perhaps wondering
what all the fuss is about) before venturing a bit farther on to
the so-called Seven Sacred Pools (which are not considered sacred
by Hawaiians and number about two dozen). As late afternoon closes
in, they beat a hurried retreat, perhaps sensing that a drive that
had been a charming delight in the morning will be three hours of
white-knuckle torture on the return.
</P>
<P>
   Those who linger in Hana thus have it to themselves. In those
evening hours, and again in the early morning before the leading
edge of the day's tourist caravan rolls in, they're treated to a
profound sense of Hawaii of old. And it is heavenly. Clearly, an
overnight stay is the optimal way to experience its charms.
</P>
<P>
   Isolation fosters the little town's simplicity. You can't get
here readily, so there is no popping in for dinner. The Hana
Highway is one route in. The other is even more daunting: the
Piilani Highway, an unimproved, all-but-deserted road around the
island's southern edge. Rental-car companies use red ink in their
drive-guide brochures to inform customers that their contracts will
be void if they venture onto this track.
</P>
<P>
   Hana has a long history of being removed from the rest of island
life, and it shows. Until the 1920s, access to it was only by boat,
mule or foot. In 1927, convict laborers, using only picks and
shovels, began hacking away at a narrow path that had been the only
route through the rainforest since ancient times. The road wasn't
even paved until the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   So Hana was allowed to exist on its own terms. It was a sugar
cane plantation until the late 1940s, when soaring costs -- not the
least of which was transporting the harvested cane off the island
-- made the operation unfeasible. Then tourism took a toehold, as
San Francisco entrepreneur Paul Fagan opened the six-room Kauiki
Inn, the forerunner to what is now the 66-acre, 66-room Hotel
Hana-Maui.
</P>
<P>
   This enterprise and others (notably cattle ranching) enabled a
high proportion of the indigenous population to remain in the area
after the cane business fizzled out. Maybe that's why the sense of
family, of stability seems to be so strong here.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other side of the island, you're with tourists like
yourself,'' said Dave Brazda, manager of the Hotel Hana-Maui.
``You're going to luaus that are more in the Tahitian tradition,
while our (entertainment) is Hawaiian. We have second and third
generations working here, people whose parents and grandparents
worked here. We have one employee getting ready to retire who's
been here 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   When it's time for the show, don't expect any fire-twirling act,
the frenetic pounding of drums (that's Tahitian, too), or
cheesecake dancers. On a Sunday evening in February, a small choir
of older Hawaiians ascended a stage in the hotel's dining room and
sang songs in their native language, accompanied only by guitars
and ukuleles. This wasn't a polished act -- many, in fact, seemed
to be wrestling mightily with pitch -- but it was absolutely
endearing.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hana itself. Over the past 30 years of Hawaii's development
boom, a trend has emerged. A hotel-builder will find a suitable
oceanfront site, then come in and scrape it clean. What follows is
what you might describe as an art director's concept of paradise:
lagoon, waterfalls, tropical trees, sandy beach. Little of it is
authentic (even the sand is trucked in at some of the Big Island's
newer resorts).
</P>
<P>
   Hana has the real deal. You want a rock-lined cove? Hana Bay is
the answer. A picturesque beach? It's hard to beat Hamoa Beach,
where the sand has a salt-and-pepper look and consistency, the
byproduct of lava decomposition. Lagoon? Oheo Gulch is nearby.
Tropical vegetation? Geez, just look around. Haleakala's rainfall
works out to an average of about an inch a day, and most of it
falls here on the eastern slope -- which is why the Hana Highway
winds through a carpet of so many hues of green.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Hana-Maui is pleasantly low-rise. Its most popular
accommodations are the Sea Ranch Cottages, built in the 1980s in
the understated design of plantation workers' quarters. Step out
onto your porch here and your view toward the sea is likely to be
punctuated by a grazing horse.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel underwent an ownership change last year and is still
working to bring in an operational partner willing to sink some
money into the place. It's needed. It hasn't undergone any capital
improvements in more than 10 years, and ``when you're in Hawaii,
sitting by the ocean, maintenance has to be done,'' Brazda said.
``The saltwater will take over.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Hotel Hana-Maui is in need of a sprucing up, you wouldn't
know it from its room rates. Brochure rates for the Sea Ranch
Cottages range between $500 and $695, while garden suites start at
$475.
</P>
<P>
   Frightened off by these steep tariffs, we opted instead for the
Hana Kai-Maui Resort, which offers 18 beach-motel-like units on
Hana Bay. The rooms, priced between $125 and $195 nightly, are
divided between two buildings, one of which faces the bay ... the
other of which faces the back of the first building. So you might
want to specify bay-front when you make your reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the rear building, the accommodations were found to be
pleasant -- primarily because they were in Hana. The room had a
broad wooden balcony with comfortable lounge furniture, a heavy
wood sliding door and screen, a ceiling fan, louvered windows on
the inland side of the unit (allowing the onshore breezes to
ventilate the place vigorously), and a full kitchen. It did not
include such amenities as beach towels, a hair dryer or an iron.
</P>
<P>
   The real appeal of the place was revealed at night. Sleeping
conditions were ideal -- so dark and so quiet, the only sounds
being the breakers rolling into Hana Bay and the tradewinds
ruffling the palm fronds.
</P>
<P>
   Another Hana attribute is its friendliness -- a refreshing break
from a longstanding Hawaiian norm. In many areas where tourists
congregate, the aloha spirit is something of a fraud, as mainland
visitors are met with surliness or, worse, are ignored altogether.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Hana has yet to be infected with this. We
encountered locals who waved from passing cars, cheerfully offered
assistance at Hasegawa's General Store and, with the exception of
those serving breakfast at the Hana Ranch Restaurant, were
unfailingly congenial. We even felt welcome at the softball game.
</P>
<P>
   After three days here it was difficult to leave, but an
adventure beckoned. The great majority of visitors to Hana return
the way they came, tackling anew the corkscrews of the Hana
Highway. The idea of heading west on the Piilani Highway -- perhaps
because the rental-car company so strenuously discouraged it --
seemed infinitely more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Four-wheel-drive is strongly recommended for its 26 miles of
dirt road, primarily because the frequency of Haleakala's stormy
fury can create some suddenly sloppy passages. But many travelers
tackle the risks of this route in compact rentals. While never
having to shift into four-wheel, we encountered three women in a
Chevy Cavalier and one fellow in a Mustang with the top down.
</P>
<P>
   Just west of Hana, a popular stop with travelers is Oheo Gulch,
where a mountain stream cascades over elaborate rock formations,
forming a series of swimming holes large and small -- commonly but
inaccurately referred to as the aforementioned Seven Sacred Pools.
It is the destination and turn-around point for many of the Hana
Highway day-trippers.
</P>
<P>
   The site is part of Haleakala National Park, and you can't miss
the crowded parking lot. Most people follow trails to the big pools
below the road, and by afternoon these swimming and rock-leaping
spots look like tourist ant hills. The pools above the road are
usually deserted, perhaps because there are no signs marking the
path to them.
</P>
<P>
   To reach them, follow a trail that parallels the road just west
of the gulch bridge (on the ocean side of the road). When you
encounter a road sign that reads ``Parking, 0.2 miles,'' cross the
road and pick up a trail that descends to the upper pools. The
mountain runoff can be bracing, but afterward you can regain warmth
by lying across one of the sun-washed boulders.
</P>
<P>
   Driving west from Oheo Gulch, you'll probably be on your own
soon after passing the idyllic bluff that is home to the Palapala
Hoomau Congregational Church, where famed aviator Charles Lindbergh
chose to be buried after living out his final years in Hana.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as the road works its way along windswept coastal bluffs,
the ride can be equal parts exhilarating and terrifying. On some
tight turns, the salt spray was blowing through the driver-side
window. Grassy hillsides swept down to gray-pebble beaches that
were utterly deserted. The ocean was absurdly blue, perhaps because
the channel between here and the Big Island is more than a mile
deep in places.
</P>
<P>
   It was reassuring to see no tourist development, no signs of
life, not even any power poles at one point -- and to enjoy these
wide-open vistas for miles and miles. There are a few scattered
signs of habitation: the weathered Kaupo Store and farther on, a
barn-like missionary church built in 1886.
</P>
<P>
   We encountered a woman driving alone from the other direction
with a map spread on the passenger seat. ``How much farther to
civilization?'' she asked in a querulous voice.
</P>
<P>
   As desolate as this land might appear, it was once home to a
thriving civilization, attested to by hundreds of archaeological
sites. These southern reaches of Maui were covered with sandalwood
forest, but the trees were felled in the 1800s because newly
arrived traders placed an extreme value on the wood, and the land
soon became arid, suitable only for cattle grazing.
</P>
<P>
   As the road began to climb toward the western end of the island,
the views became ever more spectacular, with black-lava peninsulas
jutting out into a white-capped ocean. A stop at one turn in the
road provided, with only a slight turn of the head, a view of four
other protrusions in the Hawaiian archipelago: the Big Island (the
summit of Mauna Kea poking through a cloud bank), Kahoolawe, Lanai,
and the tiny sliver that is Molokini.
</P>
<P>
   Someday this road may be fully paved, closing the loop with the
Hana Highway, which is scheduled for extensive upgrades. Until
then, this corner of Hawaii will remain blissfully untouched.
</P>
<P>
   And Hana will remain Hana.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE: Hana is 51 miles from Kahului (where Maui's
airport is located) along highways 36 and 360. Southern California
freeway drivers see the mileage distance and assume they can get
there in an hour. But over the highway's final 34 miles, it becomes
a narrow road that clings to the edge of a verdant cliff and picks
its way across 56 one-lane bridges. It is a spectacularly beautiful
drive that should not be rushed. Stop frequently to enjoy the many
waterfalls and vistas. If you allow three hours, you'll appreciate
the drive infinitely more. Allow at least that much time to drive
from Hana to the Ulupalakua Ranch around the southern end of the
island on the Piilani Highway (Route 31). The distance is 36 miles
along a track that, for much of the way, is either dirt or battered
asphalt. Most rental-car companies consider your contract void on
this road. Before embarking, check with the rangers at the
Haleakala National Park/Oheo Gulch visitors center for an update on
road conditions.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: Brochure rates for rooms at the Hotel Hana-Maui start
at $475 for garden suites, $500 for a Sea Ranch Cottage. Packages
are offered. Information and reservations: (800) 321-4262 or (808)
248-8211; www.hotelhanamaui.com. If that's too steep for your
budget, you'll probably find the Hana Kai Maui Resort (an awfully
fancy name for a motel) to be perfectly adequate. Doubles from
$125. Information and reservations: (800) 346-2772 or (808)
248-8426; www.hanakaimaui.com. Hana also has a number of
bed-and-breakfast options, which can be found through an
exploration of guidebooks or Web searches. One excellent resource
is ``Hidden Maui,'' (Ulysses Press; $13.95).
</P>
<P>
   DINING: The fine-dining options are fairly limited in Hana. As
in one. The restaurant at the Hotel Hana-Maui, imaginatively
referred to as the Main Dining Room, blends Pacific Islander, Asian
and American cuisine in a delightfully laid-back setting. If the
local fishermen have pulled in some papio, you might luck into an
entree of this delicate white fish, served grilled with garlic
butter sauce, stir-fried vegetables and mashed potatoes that have
been spread out on a griddle and flash-grilled. However, the best
thing about the restaurant is an hour of Hawaiian music presented
by local families, at 7:30 p.m. Thursday through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   PICNIC FARE: If you're just making a day trip to Hana (as most
Maui visitors do), pause briefly in the town of Paia before
tackling the highway. Later, you'll be glad you did, because the
lunch fare in Hana is sorely lacking. At the Hana Ranch
Restaurant's snack window, they prepare deli sandwiches early in
the morning -- using bread no more interesting than hamburger buns
(the only choice). You don't want to think about what tuna salad on
a hamburger bun looks like five hours after assembly. For this,
they'll gladly charge you $6. Hasegawa General Store sells only
fixings, no pre-made sandwiches. Instead, stop in Paia (four miles
from the airport) at a place called Picnics -- just off the highway
at 30 Baldwin Ave. It prepares exceptional sandwiches and box
lunches targeted specifically for Hana Highway travelers.

<P>
   HANA, Hawaii -- Around 5 p.m. Or maybe 6. That's when you begin
to notice a subtle shift in the town's personality.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the last rental cars pull out of Hana, the
unpretentious little village on the southeastern edge of the
Hawaiian island of Maui. You see the drivers glance impatiently at
their watches, then pick up speed a little as they head for the
first of 56 bridges, the first of 617 curves on the infamous Hana
Highway that will be their route out.
</P>
<P>
   It's then that Hana ceases to be a midday tourist refueling stop
and regains its truer identity.
</P>
<P>
   A softball game begins on an emerald-green field across from the
school, the very young or very old hopping onto the hoods of parked
cars to watch the action and heckle the participants. A grill leaps
to flaming life down on the beach of Hana Bay, as the day's catch
is readied for dinner. Siblings squeal with excitement as they ride
their bikes toward Hasegawa General Store in hopes of getting there
before it closes at 6:30.
</P>
<P>
   As the night descends, there will be no streetlights to defile
it. And at some point, all sound is destined to be muffled by a
sudden cloudburst.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Hana -- this is the Hawaii -- that few visitors
experience. Reams have been written about a drive on the Hana
Highway, that 51-mile scenic wonder that perches precariously along
the lush, nearly vertical eastern slope of Maui's Haleakala
volcano. But almost all of it is presented in the context of a day
trip, and that's how it is treated by the majority of visitors
staying in the resort enclaves of Kaanapali or Wailea.
</P>
<P>
   They hop into their rental cars at mid-morning and begin bending
around the 10-mph curves and over the quaint, one-lane bridges,
marveling at each waterfall, each neon-orange burst of African
tulip blossom, each sweeping vista of the cobalt-blue Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Then they make the briefest of stops in Hana (perhaps wondering
what all the fuss is about) before venturing a bit farther on to
the so-called Seven Sacred Pools (which are not considered sacred
by Hawaiians and number about two dozen). As late afternoon closes
in, they beat a hurried retreat, perhaps sensing that a drive that
had been a charming delight in the morning will be three hours of
white-knuckle torture on the return.
</P>
<P>
   Those who linger in Hana thus have it to themselves. In those
evening hours, and again in the early morning before the leading
edge of the day's tourist caravan rolls in, they're treated to a
profound sense of Hawaii of old. And it is heavenly. Clearly, an
overnight stay is the optimal way to experience its charms.
</P>
<P>
   Isolation fosters the little town's simplicity. You can't get
here readily, so there is no popping in for dinner. The Hana
Highway is one route in. The other is even more daunting: the
Piilani Highway, an unimproved, all-but-deserted road around the
island's southern edge. Rental-car companies use red ink in their
drive-guide brochures to inform customers that their contracts will
be void if they venture onto this track.
</P>
<P>
   Hana has a long history of being removed from the rest of island
life, and it shows. Until the 1920s, access to it was only by boat,
mule or foot. In 1927, convict laborers, using only picks and
shovels, began hacking away at a narrow path that had been the only
route through the rainforest since ancient times. The road wasn't
even paved until the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   So Hana was allowed to exist on its own terms. It was a sugar
cane plantation until the late 1940s, when soaring costs -- not the
least of which was transporting the harvested cane off the island
-- made the operation unfeasible. Then tourism took a toehold, as
San Francisco entrepreneur Paul Fagan opened the six-room Kauiki
Inn, the forerunner to what is now the 66-acre, 66-room Hotel
Hana-Maui.
</P>
<P>
   This enterprise and others (notably cattle ranching) enabled a
high proportion of the indigenous population to remain in the area
after the cane business fizzled out. Maybe that's why the sense of
family, of stability seems to be so strong here.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other side of the island, you're with tourists like
yourself,'' said Dave Brazda, manager of the Hotel Hana-Maui.
``You're going to luaus that are more in the Tahitian tradition,
while our (entertainment) is Hawaiian. We have second and third
generations working here, people whose parents and grandparents
worked here. We have one employee getting ready to retire who's
been here 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   When it's time for the show, don't expect any fire-twirling act,

   SYDNEY, Australia _ Blaine Wilson launched into his first vault,
tumbled through the air with his body tucked tight, only to
backpedal badly through his landing.
</P>
<P>
   On his second vault, there was no mishap, but the difficulty
level of the routine was so low, he had no way to win a medal in
the Olympic apparatus finals Friday at the Super Dome. Just after
Wilson's sixth-place finish, Elise Ray bobbled her way to the
bottom of the women's standings in the balance beam finals.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1972 _ not including the 1980 boycott
year _ the United States failed to win a gymnastics medal at the
Olympics. Once again, as part of a trend this last week, there was
plenty of blame but no accountability for the disappointment.
Monday, a conspiracy theory was added to the mix of excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're judged on how you look and not by what you do,
you're not going to get the score,'' Wilson said. ``The judges
don't like Americans, I think. Some do; some don't. It's all
subjective.''
</P>
<P>
   More than the judges, it was the pressure seemed to get to the
Americans. The leaders of the men's and women's teams had
particular trouble coping. Instead of leading the men to a
reachable bronze team medal, Wilson buckled during the competition
and the men's team finished fifth. Instead of redemption, he found
disappointment in the all-around competition, then again in the
apparatus finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of explaining that winning a medal doesn't make you
a person,'' Wilson said. ``I'm a two-time Olympian.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Ray's first time. She had her hiccups in her effort to
lead the women to the medal stand (they were fourth in the team
competition), but also had to endure the cruel twist of a
mismeasured vault in the all-around competition. Monday, she felt
all eyes on her as America's last chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympics has not been everything I had hoped the whole
experience would be,'' Ray said. ``A lot of things I didn't think
would happen did happen.''
</P>
<P>
   What did happen Monday resulted in two more medals for Aleksei
Nemov of Russia, who edged Benjamin Varonian of France for the gold
on the horizontal bar and took a bronze on the parallel bars; his
six medals here equaled his count in Atlanta four years ago.
Russia's Svetlana Khorkina added a silver from the floor exercise
to the gold she won in the uneven bars on Sunday. Her teammate,
Yelena Zamolodtchikova, won gold on the floor exercises. Gervasio
Deferr of Spain won the gold in the vault; Li Xiaopeng of China won
gold on the parallel bars; and Liu Xuan captured China's first gold
on the balance beam.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The United States, meanwhile, was left to examine a system that
seems to have stalled. There is no united training program for the
men. And the women's team is in disarray. Four years after a gold
medal in Atlanta, Bela Karolyi's last-minute insertion into the
revival plan left the team divided. Once the women came up short of
a team bronze, a flurry of back-biting and finger-pointing flowed
from coaches and athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Did the USA Gymnastic president Bob Colarossi give Karolyi too
little control or too much when he asked the Romanian to save the
program? Did Coach Kelli Hill's conservative approach on the floor
leave the team flat? Were there too many coaches, too many separate
agendas? Everyone voiced his and her criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was too much of that, both in the arena and in
the gym, between coaches and the gymnasts,'' Ray said of the
bickering. ``I think it took our focus away. But it's our job to
keep our focus.''
</P>
<P>
   In her response, the 18-year-old Ray was more adult than most of
her sniping elders. But when asked how disturbing the discord was
to him, Colarossi professed ignorance. He said he had paid no
attention to the accounts of dysfunction emanating from the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put the program in place,'' said Colarossi, who tugged
Karolyi out of retirement to be the national coordinator after the
women's team finished sixth in the 1999 World Championships. ``We
went up two spots, so it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Colarossi, there were few signs of satisfaction. As
she left, Hill expressed her distaste for the blueprint devised
when Karolyi entered and began a series of camps that led up to the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think we moved from sixth to fourth because of the camps?
No,'' Hill said. ``Bela has a huge amount of knowledge, and he's a
great motivator, but you can't take kids coached by individual
coaches and turn them over to him for the last six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get on the same page. I don't have any idea how.''
</P>
<P>
   There is uncertainty about the future of USA Gymnastics. Unlike
the factory systems that still pop out champions in Romania, China
and Russia, American gymnasts still like to attend their proms.
That has been the issue for years. In the end, there seems to be no
good excuse for the 28-year low the program has found itself in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing,'' Ray said. ``At the same time, I don't
think anyone has ever had to go through what we did this year. So
it's a totally different ballgame. I don't know what will happen in
the future.''

&HT;     POLL SHOWS BUSH SLIPPING IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush's campaign trips to
California and his advertising drive in the state have done little
to reverse support for Vice President Al Gore, according to a
survey released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Examiner/KTVU television poll shows Gore
leading Bush, the Republican candidate, 50 percent to 38 percent _
the first time the Democratic vice president had hit the 50 percent
mark.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone survey of 820 likely California voters was taken
Sept. 17-Sept. 20 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   A July Examiner/KTVU poll taken just before the national
political party conventions in Philadelphia and Los Angeles showed
Gore 7 percentage points ahead of Bush. Bush also had a
stronger-than-expected showing among Hispanics and among voters in
the unpredictable Central Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore has made frequent trips to California, including a
rally and fund-raising swing through the Silicon Valley and
Hollywood last week, he is not advertising on television here. He
is concentrating his energies on battleground states such as
Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Gore has received a significant boost in
California since the conventions. As the nation's most populous
state, California carries considerable weight in presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Del Ali of Research 2000 in Rockville, Md., which
conducted the survey, said the survey should prod Bush to change
his strategy of actively campaigning in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the fact that Bush is in the state and has spent some
time there, as much as he has pledges not to abandon California, he
may seriously want to considered writing this state off because I
would put his chances at slim and none,'' Ali said.
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed that Green Party candidate Ralph Nader had
slipped from 8 percent support among those surveyed to 5 percent,
suggesting that Democrats may be ``coming home'' after the
Democratic National Convention last month in Los Angeles, where
Gore outlined a more populist, working-class theme than he had
before.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the worst news is that for the first time more voters
had an unfavorable rating of him than favorable. Forty percent said
they had a favorable view of Bush, compared with 43 percent who
viewed him unfavorably; 59 percent of those surveyed had a
favorable view of Gore compared with 37 percent unfavorable.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's support among Hispanic voters dropped from 26 percent to
21 percent from July to last week, according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
   On leadership issues, Gore also has the advantage in California,
according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
   Those surveyed said they thought Gore would do the best job of
managing the economy, dealing with the federal budget surplus,
reforming Social Security and Medicare, providing ``a coherent
vision for America's place in the world,'' and upholding civil
rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   Even the one issue Bush has been hitting on recently _ trust _
scored higher for Gore than Bush in California. Although Bush
believes Gore misstates facts and misleads the public on important
policy issues, 41 percent of those surveyed said they trusted Gore,
while 32 percent said they trusted Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The poll is simply a snapshot of what voters were thinking about
a presidential election that could change as the major candidates
prepare for three nationally televised debates beginning Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his uphill battle in California, Bush is being pressured
to campaign for Republican congressional candidates in California.
But he also doesn't want to be tagged as weak for leaving behind
the largest state, like Republican nominee Bob Dole did in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always seen as a sign of weakness; whether or not it is a
weakness is irrelevant,'' said Timothy A. Hodson, executive
director of the Center for California Studies at California State
University at Sacramento. ``Any time that a campaign appears to
have written off a major state, the largest state in the union,
then clearly the obvious message is it's a campaign in trouble,
otherwise why wouldn't they be competing?''

CUBANS FAVORED FOR BOXING GOLD BUT COMPETITORS NOT BACKING OFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: Early story. To be subbed after heavyweight fight
tonight.) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ After the first week of the Olympic boxing
tournament, the favorites, the formidable Cuban boxers, have
dominated as expected with 10 fighters still competing in the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has won 23 Olympic boxing medals since 1972 despite missing
two Olympic Games because of political boycotts and they are poised
to add significantly to that total.
</P>
<P>
   More surprising, however, is the number of other countries
challenging the Cubans in these Games.
</P>
<P>
   A talented but young U.S. team is part of the group with seven
fighters reaching the quarterfinals, including two reigning world
champs. But the United States has been joined in the pursuit of
Cuba by a handful of other countries. Two nations _ Kazakhstan and
Ukraine _ have as many boxers left as the United States and Russia
has eight.
</P>
<P>
   The head-to-head fights between the United States and Cuba may
remain the marquee rivalry of the boxing tournament _ highlighted
by Tuesday's fight between heavyweights Michael Bennett and
two-time Olympic champion Felix Savon of Cuba _ but the rest of the
world is chasing the Cubans, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban boxing team and its legendary coach, Alcides Sagarra,
have kept to themselves at the Sydney boxing venue, logging
methodical and sometimes spectacular victories without a single
post-fight comment. Three Cubans _ Juan Hernandez, Guillermo
Rigondeaux and Alexis Rubalcaba _ have won with stunning, one-punch
knockouts.
</P>
<P>
   However, before coming to Sydney, in Havana, Sagarra was quoted
in the Cuban newspapers as saying his team was ``going to clean
up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They will be playing our national anthem 12 times,'' Sagarra
said. Sagarra may have exaggerated, but his team is so far the
class of the field.
</P>
<P>
   Savon and Bennett is not the only featured match between U.S.
and Cuban fighters this week. Hernandez and U.S. light middleweight
Jermain Taylor will meet Wednesday. Taylor has looked impressive in
his two preliminary fights, but Hernandez is a world champion with
punishing power.
</P>
<P>
   Other than U.S. light flyweight Brian Viloria, who won last
year's world championship in his division, few of the clear
favorites have been beaten in any weight class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are stacking up pretty much like I expected,'' Mustin
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. coach said he doesn't feel the rivalry with Cuba
until he has to face their fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many other countries out there getting in our
way,'' he said. ``France has done well, it was a French fighter who
beat Viloria.''
</P>
<P>
   France is one of eight countries with five or more fighters
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the U.S. boxers have a tough draw in the tournament from
here on, beginning with Bennett, who faces Savon after just one
preliminary fight, and Taylor, who should have his hands full with
Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Ricardo Juarez, the featherweight world champ,
will fight Thailand's Somluck Kamsing, who has looked strong, fast
and confident. Kamsing also has a large and vocal group of fans
attending his fights in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Vinson of the United States, will face the world
bantamweight champ Raicu Crinu of Romania on Tuesday evening.
Flyweight Jose Navarro on Wednesday goes against Jerome Thomas,
another one of the rising French fighters.
</P>
<P>
   There have been pleasant surprises for the U.S. team. Neither
light welterweight Ricardo Williams Jr., nor middleweight Jeff Lacy
was considered a top medal contender coming into the Sydney Games,
but Williams and Lacy have joined Taylor as the most impressive
U.S. fighters so far.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who will fight Alexandre Leonov of Russia on
Wednesday, has great hand-eye coordination and fast feet, a
combination that makes him hard to hit and a good counterpuncher.
</P>
<P>
   Lacy has knocked out one opponent and stopped another in the
second round. He's the hardest puncher on the team, with a
crunching right hand. Lacy will fight Tuesday against Russia's
Gaidarbek Gaidarekov.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Mustin tries not to think of the Cubans as the key to
his team's chances, he knows they have the most boxers left and
will likely be in his fighters' path sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Bennett's fight with Savon and Jermain Taylor's with
Hernandez are two critical fights for us,'' Mustin said over the
weekend. ``They might set a tone.''

TOUGH-MINDED AUSTRALIAN PAIR DEFEAT BRAZILIANS TO TAKE GOLD IN
VOLLEYBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Australia's Kerri Pottharst _ Potsy to her
friends _ became a beach volleyball player for the most obvious
reason of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved to hang out at the beach,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pottharst turned her cap backward and played on, even through
four knee operations.
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Cook, Pottharst's playing partner, tread an exacting
path of a different sort. Seeking a competitive edge, Cook recently
sought out a ``success coach.'' It's the specialty of Kurek Ashley,
an American who tutored Cook in various acts of derring-do, like
walking on shattered glass and hot coals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you believe the impossible isn't impossible,'' Cook
said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for all their enterprise, Pottharst and Cook were never
better than second to the top-rated Brazilian combination of Shelda
Bede and Adriana Behar until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Before 10,000 fans, many waving Australian flags and dressed in
green and gold, Pottharst and Cook defeated Bede and Behar, 12-11,
12-10, in the gold medal match. And the Australians did so in
stunning fashion, with late rallies that left the home crowd
delirious.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil also took home the bronze, as Adriana Samuel and Sandra
Pires defeated Japan's Yukiko Takahashi and Teru Saiki, 12-4,
12-10.
</P>
<P>
   Pottharst and Cook had worked at the karma of their matchup,
filling their team lodgings in the last month with dozens of things
colored gold _ replica medals, goldfish, goblets, volleyballs and
wall hangings. They bought gold toothpaste and gold shampoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan was to have this tidal wave of emotion and thought,''
Cook said. ``And to have it wash over the Brazilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, surfers cruising Pacific Ocean whitecaps were visible
through the portals of the makeshift grandstand that rises above
shimmering Bondi Beach. On the sand below, Pottharst and Cook were
riding a swell of their own.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Pottharst lay face down in the sand for half a
minute with Cook kneeling over her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just lost it,'' said Pottharst, who at 35 is 10 years Cook's
senior. ``I could not believe we had won. You dream of something
forever, and when it happens, sometimes it's too amazing to
comprehend.''
</P>
<P>
   Behar and a tearful Bede, who later apologized to Brazilian fans
for the loss, were also embracing at their end of the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great scene today, a great party,'' said Behar, who
won a gold medal with a different partner four years ago. ``But you
have to know the disappointment for us, too.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For Pottharst and Cook, it was the culmination of an odd
four-year journey. Now the ``best of mates,'' Cook said, they had
split as playing partners after the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, where
they teamed to win a bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 10 years apart, and it had become too much like big
sister and little sister,'' Cook said. ``I needed to learn some
things for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Reunited last year, they agreed to come together as equals.
``Though we still get on each other's nerves,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Pottharst brought her powerful serve, Cook a consistency in all
areas and some fresher, younger legs. They needed both Monday,
especially when the Brazilians took 10-6 leads in both games. The
first team to 12 points wins.
</P>
<P>
   The Australians won the first game, also called a set, when
Cook's serve hit the top of the net and fell straight down. So a
lucky break brought the first big ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Bede and Behar looked stunned, but took the same commanding 10-6
lead in the next game. Consecutive spikes by Cook cut Brazil's lead
in half, and then with Pottharst serving, the Australians tied the
score, 10-10. Pottharst was again serving at 11-10 when a return by
Bede shockingly fell wide of the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Pottharst fell to her knees and buried her head. Earlier in the
week, she had called the large crowd distracting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't used to it,'' she said. ``We don't play before crowds
like that. I wanted to say, `Would you all just shut up?'''
</P>
<P>
   But Pottharst and Cook came to embrace the crowd. They included
the fans as partners in their pursuit of the gold medal, a movement
they called ``The Dreamachine.''
</P>
<P>
   As Pottharst lay in the sand in victory, Cook beside her, the
ovation reverberated around the natural rock formation that
protects Bondi Beach's radiant sandy shore. Suddenly, Pottharst
jumped to her feet and threw handfuls of sand in the air.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, hat still on backward, she addressed the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's a dream,'' Potsy said, ``but I'll remember this
day for the rest of my life.''

CHINA TAKES GOLD IN TABLE TENNIS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ When Sweden's Jan-Ove Waldner travels to
China to play table tennis, he is mobbed when he leaves his hotel,
as if he were a rock star walking around Manhattan or a soccer star
walking around Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese recognize Waldner for his Olympic gold medal in
1992, for his endurance and for his style.
</P>
<P>
   But in these Summer Games, there is no mercy for the venerable
Waldner, who turns 35 on Oct. 3. Ten years his junior, Kong Linghui
of China outlasted Waldner for the gold medal in five sets Monday
night, in a match of mood swings.
</P>
<P>
   In the bronze medal match, Liu Guoliang of China, the 1996
Olympic champion, defeated Joergen Persson of Sweden in four sets.
Fans of both nations _ including King Carl Gustaf and Queen Silvia
of Sweden, both wearing yellow shirts _ waved flags and chanted for
players who are quite familiar to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect him since my childhood,'' Kong said. ``He has been
playing against China for several generations.''
</P>
<P>
   This admirable expression of sportsmanship and respect from Kong
might be traced to his being a distant descendant of Confucius, the
ancient Chinese philosopher and teacher, although Kong played down
the link in an interview in a magazine, saying: ``I'm an ordinary
person. I can't boast about things I personally haven't done.''
</P>
<P>
   He now has a gold medal in the latest match between these two
table tennis powers. The bond is personified by the link between
Kong and Waldner. Eight years ago, the young Kong was sent to
Sweden to play for Kalmar BTK in the Elite League, Sweden's top
professional table tennis league. It was a common move by the
Chinese to make a bit of money, perhaps, but it was also done to
give Chinese players experience in different styles of play.
</P>
<P>
   Waldner, who has traveled extensively in China, now plays for
Kalmar, but they have never played for that team at the same time.
And Swedish players go to China because it is the center of the
universe in table tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have a conversation with a normal person on the street
and they know all about him,'' Ulf Carlsson, the Swedish coach,
said of Waldner.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have dominated the sport since it joined the Olympic
movement in 1988. China has won 14 gold, 9 silver and 3 bronze
medals, including all four golds this year. Sweden has one bronze
in addition to Waldner's gold and silver.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Chinese domination is hardly an accident, as Kong explained
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``A major reason is the training,'' Kong said. ``We are able to
get excellent athletes to play this sport, so we can win with
different players. We are able to see videos to evaluate the
techniques. It is very difficult to win, as you have seen today,
and in the final points, it depends on luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Waldner is seen as one player who can stand up to the Chinese.
He is known as a sociable visitor, who likes to get out perhaps as
much as he likes to practice. He also has an eccentric serve in
which he contorts his right arm inward, so that his serve seemingly
emerges from under his left armpit.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, facing game point in the second game, Waldner
maneuvered his opponent to his left, leaving plenty of table for a
smash, but he played it too fine and missed the table entirely. He
then lost the first 4 points of the third game, but somehow stormed
back to win two straight games.

   In the fifth game, Kong tried to play to Waldner's forehead and
ran off an early lead of 10-1. Waldner maintained that he did not
lose his composure, saying: ``If you cannot concentrate in the
fifth game of the Olympics, you shouldn't even play.''
</P>
<P>
   He came back to a 15-12 deficit before losing. Then the Chinese
celebrated their latest gold medal, while the Swedish king and
queen left, mingling with other spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese dominance is not likely to be affected by the rule
change coming on Oct. 1, enlarging the official ball from 38
millimeters (1.496 inches) in width to 40 (1.5748 inches). The ball
is being changed to produce longer rallies, but whether that will
help an older player like Waldner remains to be seen.

   ``He has been very important in this sport, and I admire him
very much, but whether he can continue to play, I don't know,'' the
descendant of Confucius said.

   GORE-BIANCHI _ WASHINGTON - Ever since Al Gore described her as
``scary smart'' in a newspaper interview, Sarah Bianchi has gotten
a lot of good-natured kidding from family and friends. And when
asked to confirm Gore's assessment, she demurs. ``Scary, maybe,''
she says. But when it comes to issues like health care, Medicare,
Medicaid, Social Security and welfare reform, Gore turns first to
the 27-year-old Atlanta native. (Shepard, Cox News Service). 30.

   EDUCATING-HISPANICS _ WASHINGTON Ways to lift the educational
performance of Hispanic students up to the level of other American
students by 2010 are spelled out in a final report to be handed to
two Clinton Cabinet members at a ceremony Monday by the President's
Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence. In their swan song,
after years of explaining how and why so many Hispanics are so
poorly educated, the commissioners offer tips to educators,
businesses, Hispanic parents and the next president on how to reach
that goal. (Mollison, Cox News Service). 20.

   STONEMOUNTAIN _ STONE MOUNTAIN, Ga. _ To some who've never heard
of Silver Dollar City, the company that runs Stone Mountain Park
must sound like a Vegas casino. To those who know the company
operates theme parks in Branson, Mo., and Pigeon Forge, Tenn., _
choice destinations for lovers of retired country music acts, Elvis
impersonators and outlet shopping - it's an amusement park operator
that's about to blight a Confederate monument and Mother Nature.
Ever since securing a lease to manage Stone Mountain Park
operations, Silver Dollar officials have been fighting an uphill
battle to convince opponents that they aren't the tacky carney
operators they've been made out to be. (Smith, The Altanta

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Bill Clinton's presidency was stolen from him.
That's more or less official now that independent counsel Robert
Ray has declared that Whitewater, the ``scandal'' that launched a
thousand supposed scandals, was no scandal at all. (Teepen, Cox
News Service.)

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ ``Ignorant folks,'' my
father used to say, ``are not stupid _ they're just uninformed in
some areas. Still, they're mighty good at finger-pointing and
name-calling. But,'' he'd remind me, ``always remember they're
voicing their own fears, not their knowledge.'' Over the years, I
must have heard this at least a hundred times. (Schuett, Cox News
Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   LANE-COLUMN _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Alexander Hamilton was not
nearly as likable as Ronald Reagan. He was vain, sneaky and had to
let everybody know he was the smartest guy in the room. Yeah, I
know: He laid the foundation for the American economic system and
kept the nation fiscally afloat when we were a mere start-up
venture. But born illegitimate and dead in a duel? And that nasty
negative campaign against Thomas Jefferson? And the hush money paid
after an adulterous affair? Is this a role model for children?

problem with daytime television? Is it: (A) Blood-and-guts
violence? (B) Testimonials from slack-jawed low-lifes about their

<P>
   WIGGNS-SCOUTS _Back when I was a Boy Scout in the mid-'50s, sex
hadn't been
</P>
<P>
   invented, much less homosexuality. Married folks procreated by
holding hands during Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movies. The Boy
Scout Manual did make some glancing reference to boys who were
troubled by impure thoughts and spent too much time alone brooding.
This didn't seem to apply to me and my Scouting buddies. We rather
enjoyed our impure thoughts, such as, ``Do Girl Scouts wear green
underthings?'' And if so, what assumptions can we make about
Brownies? (Wiggins, Palm Beach Post)

   MINOR-COLUMN _ I'm in shock, and it's not because W. was funny
on
</P>
<P>
   Oprah the other day, which he was. But W. is always funny when
he tries

<P>

   RANCH-HOUSES _ WACO, Texas _ It's architecture that evokes Mom's
green-bean casserole, Dad's patio barbecues, Skip and Sis on their
Schwinn bikes and the Zenith TV console in the den. Ranch houses,
those rambling, low-slung houses of the '50s and '60s, hang on in
the 21st century as icons of suburbia, at its cookie-cutter worst
and its bucolic best. And now the moment of truth is arriving: Do
we care enough about these houses to preserve them? (Waco

   WILSON-HOUSE _ TEMPLE, Texas _ You could easily overlook the
Wilson House, a ranch house in a quiet neighborhood of ranch houses
east of Interstate 35 in Temple, Texas. It's a pleasant but
unassuming U-shaped house of natural stone and brick, shaded by big
oaks and deep overhanging eaves. But step inside, and it's another
story altogether. Bursting with shiny orange, turquoise, hot pink,
black and yellow surfaces, furnished with sleek appliances and
furniture, the home's interior looks like a home decor ad from the
Kennedy era. Ralph Wilson Sr., founder of Wilsonart International
plastics company, built the house in 1959 as his private home and a
showcase for his laminates, then an exotic new material not widely
used in homes. In 1998, it was named to the National Register of
Historic Places, and last year it received an award from the
National Trust for Historic Preservation. (JBSmith, Waco

   answer stupid questions. If you're a No Name covering a show,
you take

<P>
   posed pictures and ask stupid questions. At Oscar de la Renta
earlier this week, Sex and the City star Sarah Jessica Parker was
encircled by a press pack starving for a famous face. (Sturrock,

   LIL-BOWWOW _Instead of saying ``Hey there's a big new release
from pre-teen rapper Lil' Bow Wow in stores today,'' we're going to
do the clueless adults one better: Teach them the words to his no.
1 single ``Bounce Wit Me;'' and try to explain what they mean. The
song on the Atlanta-based So So Def Record label is replete with
slang, starting with the first line: ``Round here we pop them
collars.'' ``Pop your collar'' is not only a new way of saying
``really show off'' (remember the way the Fonz wore his collar?),
but it's also the title of local singer/actor Usher's new single.
Sense a trend happening? (SoMurray, The Altanta

 BY TERESE LOEB KREUZER 
 &HT;    (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I first saw Bobby Olivacce one hot December night, walking down
a narrow street in Savan. He had a long dark beard, Rastafarian
dreadlocks, and the gaunt, intense face of an Old Testament
prophet. He was holding a large bunch of wheatgrass.
 &HT;    I was driving through this 200-year-old section of Charlotte
Amalie with my friend, Jacquel Dawson, who pulled over in front of
the high stoop of the Red Ball Grocery Store and introduced us. She
told Bobby I had come to the U.S. Virgin Islands to learn about how
herbs were used to cure and prevent disease, and specifically to
learn about what the old-timers call ``bush medicine,'' _ the use
of herbs that could be plucked from the forest and transformed into
teas, poultices, healing baths and restorative tinctures.
 &HT;    Bobby peered through the open window of Jacquel's battered,
rust-colored Toyota and told me that herbs were his way of life.
 &HT;    ``All Rastafarians are herbalists,'' he said. ``Some know more
than others,'' he added, modestly omitting to mention what Jacquel
later told me, that in the 16 years since he had come to St. Thomas
from his native Dominica, he had become known far and wide as a
healer. Some people consulted him when they were sick, while others
just needed some advice about how to use an herb in their backyard.
Bobby was a sort of roving herb shop, sometimes ministering to as
many as 100 people a day.
 &HT;    There are still many people in the U.S. Virgin Islands who would
rather go to an herbal healer like Bobby than to a medical doctor,
and there are some who go to an herbalist when ``modern'' remedies
have failed.
 &HT;    A rooster crossed the road and two men lounged on a stoop
drinking beer as Bobby said, ``If someone with a cold comes to me
for help, I remind them that the cold has a cause, and the cause is
bad eats and drinks, shallow breathing, laziness and wickedness.''
 &HT;    '' Wickedness?'' I asked.
 &HT;    Bobby smiled slightly. ``Wickedness is a way of life that is
selfish and that affects others adversely.''
 &HT;    As Jacquel and I said good-bye, Bobby invited me to look him up
and ``reason'' with him next time I was in town. I said I would.
 &HT;    Where Bobby comes from _ Dominica _ is still a wild place of
rain forests, farms and small villages. The same can't be said of
the U.S. Virgin Islands, which have been territories of the United
States since 1917. They have a patina of American culture _ cars,
television sets, large resort hotels, housing projects, a love
affair wth all that money can buy.
 &HT;    Of the four U.S. Virgins (St. Thomas, St. Croix, St. John, and
tiny Water Island), St. Thomas in particular has been built up. The
once-quiet streets of Charlotte Amalie, the capital, are often
thronged with tourists who debark from enormous cruise ships by the
thousands. As they scurry to spend their money in the duty-free
shops, the chances are that few suspect that there's another side
to this island. I wouldn't have known, either, if Jacquel hadn't
shown me.
 &HT;    Just a block beyond the end of Main Street's (Droningen Gade's)
shopping strip is the old Market Square. There's been a market here
since the 17th century. In sugar plantation days, this was one of
the places where African slaves were sold when they first came off
the ships.
 &HT;    The Africans brought with them their knowledge of medicinal
herbs and how to contact ancestral spirits. They adapted their
practices to the new world, blending what they knew with what they
learned from the Amerindians.
 &HT;    On Saturdays, beginning at 3 a.m., farmers arrive at the market.
They sell fish, meat, fresh produce and herbs _ black wattle, worry
wine, several kinds of sage, cattle tongue, Spanish needle, bay
leaf, lemongrass and japana _ to name a few.
 &HT;    Some of these herbs will be used in cooking, while others will
be bought strictly for medicinal purposes. Many are herbs that used
to grow profusely in the bush or in people's yards. But life on
these islands began to change around 50 years ago _ at first,
gradually, then drastically. People moved to the states to get jobs
or go to college and never came back. At the same time, there was
an influx of people from other islands _ the Dominican Republic,
Dominica, Haiti, St. Lucia, St. Kitts, Antigua. Housing was built
to accommodate them. The bush was cut down or cut back. Some plants
that were once common became hard to find or virtually extinct. The
lore that had passed within families from generation to generation
about how to recognize plants and how to use them medicinally was
no longer as widespread as it once was.
 &HT;    This is not to say that the use of bush or an affection for it
disappeared. But it became diluted. Today, for instance, a store
called The Fruit Bowl in the Wheatley Shopping Center in Charlotte
Amalie sells an herb labeled ``Tea Bush.'' It's lemongrass,
certainly one form of tea bush, but only one of scores of herbs
that have traditionally been used to make medicinal tea on these
islands.
 &HT;    One afternoon, Jacquel took me back to Savan to meet Mavis de
Jongh who was born on St. Thomas in 1920. She has a pretty, white
house surrounded by tamarind and flamboyant trees on the edge of
town. Leaning on her cane and looking up at the steep hill dotted
with houses above her dwelling, she says that she remembers when
there was nothing there but trees.
 &HT;    She also remembers that when she was little, bush was used for
all occasions. ``If you had a cold, you were given black wattle. We
took lemongrass for fever, anise for stomach ache, pigeon pea for
abscess in the mouth, Spanish needle to cleanse internally. Bush
teas were used originally to prevent problems and to sustain
health. My grandmother knew what to use.''
 &HT;    Today, Mrs. de Jongh goes to medical doctors, but she still has
bush growing in her yard _ and she knows how to use it if she needs
it.
 &HT;    Mrs. de Jongh's recollections of her childhood are not unusual.
Many people attest to the wisdom of their mothers and grandmothers
who knew what to do for most run-of-the-mill complaints. In more
serious circumstances, they might consult a weedwoman. She was a
respected member of the community with a specialized knowledge of
herbs. She would gather them and sell them in the marketplace,
dispensing not only the herbal remedy, but instructions on how to
use it. She might also serve as a midwife, prescribing herbs to
prepare a woman for birth and administering a bush bath to help her
recover afterward.
 &HT;    The best-known weedwoman in the U.S. Virgin Islands at the
moment is Veronica Gordon, 52, of St. Croix. Her family has lived
on St. Croix for seven generations.
 &HT;    When she was 4 years old, she contracted polio. In the
aftermath, her father, Patrick N. Gordon, a respected herbalist,
``picked a feg of aloe cloves'' which he whipped up with egg
whites. Then he took her down to the sea, dipped her in, anointed
her with the mixture he had prepared, and rubbed her legs.
 &HT;    ``Oh, God, I was sore,'' she remembers. ``But it worked. My legs
were fine. I could climb trees a year later. This was my
introduction to bush medicine.''
 &HT;    Veronica learned about bush medicine from her father, who had
learned from his mother. ``In my family, the knowledge goes from
gender to gender,'' she says. ``It has to be first-born male to the
first-born female.''
 &HT;    Now, as her father did before her, she sees private clients. She
also occasionally gives demonstrations and lectures at the St.
George Village Botanical Garden on St. Croix.
 &HT;    The 16-acre botanical garden, which is set among the ruins of an
old sugar plantation, has more than 1,000 species of trees, vines
and shrubs, including an herb garden devoted just to the plants
that were used historically on the island by the weedwomen _ and
often, still are.
 &HT;    Another St. Croix resident, botanist Olasee Davis, has been
working diligently for years to preserve this knowledge and
transmit it to a younger generation. He writes an ecology column
for a local newspaper and was a major contributor to a book called
``Traditional Medicinal Plants of St. Croix, St. Thomas and St.
John.''
 &HT;    Olasee, an extension specialist with the University of the
Virgin Islands, leads hikes to the wild regions of St. Croix.
Though most visitors never see them, they're not far from the
shopping centers, the Hess Oil refinery and the highway that links
the two major towns _ Christiansted and Frederiksted _ of this
82-square-mile island.
 &HT;    One morning, as he precedes a group of teen-agers from a local
junior high school down the arid, wind-swept beach of Jacks Bay on
the eastern end of St. Croix, he stops every few yards to talk
about another plant.
 &HT;    ``This is inkberry,'' he says, pointing to a shrub with purple
stems and dark green leaves. ``Our grandparents used to crush the
berries for ink.'' He also tells the students that the leaves can
be used to treat thrush, boils and burns.
 &HT;    He shows them how sea grape leaves can be used to make a cup or
a plate and how the stiff twigs of the maran bush can serve as a
toothbrush or a yard broom. He tells them that the leaves of a
common evergreen tree called the starvation apple can be made into
a poultice to treat arthritis, burns, sprains and swelling. He
pauses in front of the familiar, bright yellow, bell-shaped flowers
of the ginger thomas bush (the U.S.V.I.'s national flower) and
mentions that the leaves can be made into a tonic to treat high
blood pressure and diabetes.
 &HT;    Olasee estimates that he hikes with more than 8,000 students a
year, but he also takes off-island visitors on his
``eco-educational tours'' of St. Croix's bays, rain forest, salt
ponds and wetlands.
 &HT;    After meeting Olasee, Veronica and Bobby, I drove around St.
Croix with new awareness. I noticed the women selling homemade
maubi by the side of the road. Bittersweet Maubi, a local beverage
made from bark, is refreshing in this hot climate, and is also said
to ameliorate diabetes, liver problems and diarrhea.
 &HT;    I stopped in Armstrong's ice cream shop on Route 70 and observed
that the flavors included soursop, which comes from a tree whose
leaves are made into a sleep-inducing tea.
 &HT;    I went into the Pueblo supermarket where I bought sorrel (said
to be helpful for kidney and bladder ailments), senna (a mild
laxative) and eucalyptus leaves (to make a tea that relieves colds
and fevers).
 &HT;    And I thought about something that Olasee had told the children.
``In nature, everything has a function,'' he had said. ``There are
no weeds.''

U.S. MEN FINISH PRELIMINARY ROUND UNDEFEATED AFTER 106-94 WIN OVER
FRANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Sometime between last May and Monday night,
Vince Carter developed a serrated edge on the basketball court.
Gone is the cuddly Toronto Raptors acrobat with the post-game
disposition of a koala and the Inside Stuff smile.
</P>
<P>
   At the Olympic Games of all places, he has decided to share with
the world a take-no-prisoners side of himself. Carter's performance
here has come with the preening after a score, the altercations
with inferior players, the jeering by fed-up Australian fans.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew that the guy whose mother put encouraging notes on his
hotel pillow after a playoff loss had any outlaw in him?
</P>
<P>
   But Carter has also provided splendid athletic moments, too,
breathtaking plays to make everyone forgive and forget. And Monday
night, no transgression could stop the crowd at the Dome in Olympic
Park from rising and cheering the most spectacular dunk anyone
could remember in international competition.
</P>
<P>
   With 16 minutes left in the second half of Team USA's 106-94
victory over France, Carter intercepted a pass a few feet in front
of the midcourt line. All that stood between his 6-foot-6 frame and
the rim was Frederic Weis, a gawky, 7-2 Frenchman trying to draw an
offensive foul some four feet from the basket on the left side.
</P>
<P>
   Carter took one power dribble and rose. And rose. And rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I took off a long way out and wasn't sure if I was
going to make it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He did. Carter somehow leaped completely over Weis, using the
Frenchman's head for balance as he slammed the ball with his body
splayed in spread-eagle fashion. He resembled a boy leapfrogging a
parking meter. The rim shook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Le facial,'' a member of French news media said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He joked with me at the end, `Did you see that dunk I put in
your face?''' said Weis, taking the harsh post-game humor in
stride. ``I didn't see. Was too quick. I was not moving, trying to
take a charge. But he jump over me. It's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I say `Why on me? I'm going to be on the poster dunk and I
don't like this.' He started laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans were impressed as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time I've ever seen a play like that is when I jumped
over my 4-year-old son on one of those Nerf-ball baskets,'' U.S.
coach Rudy Tomjanovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kidd, the Team USA point guard, said: ``I think everybody
was in awe, and nobody thought he was going to attempt that. To me,
that was probably the greatest play in basketball I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's liftoff and splashdown over Weis, the much-maligned
Frenchman whom the Knicks shockingly took with the 15th pick in the
1999 NBA draft, obscured another mediocre outing from Team USA.
France's 12-point margin of defeat was the second-lowest margin of
victory by a team of American professional players since the
international basketball federation began allowing NBA players to
compete in 1992. Last Thursday, Lithuania crept within 9 points of
the Americans and trailed by only 5 with less than two minutes
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Team USA, which finished 5-0 atop Group A, will meet Russia
(3-2), the fourth-seeded team in Group B, in the quarterfinals on
Wednesday. But in incremental ways, the Americans continue to
reveal their fallibility against patient and physical teams. Tim
Hardaway and Shareef Abdur-Rahim both got into altercations with
French players, drawing technical fouls and the ire of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   It is not always the United States instigating the trouble.
Grabbing, clutching and swinging their forearms, many international
players clearly hold this collection of NBA All-Stars in much less
esteem than their Olympic predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international players are getting better because there are
more players coming to the NBA to play,'' Kidd said. ``The fear of
the Dream Team is gone. Ninety-two was the best team ever
assembled. Now guys aren't as scared or afraid to play against us
and you can see that in the first five games.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada (4-1) pulled off perhaps its greatest international upset
Monday night, knocking off the defending world champion, Yugoslavia
(4-1), 83-75, to win Group B and avoid the Americans at least until
the gold-medal game. Steve Nash scored 26 points.
</P>
<P>
   Australia (3-2) was also the beneficiary of good fortune after a
91-80 comeback victory over Spain (1-4). By taking third place in
Group B, the host nation will meet Italy (3-2) in the quarterfinals
and set themselves up to avoid meeting the United States until the
gold-medal game.
</P>
<P>
   Lithuania (3-2) meets Yugoslavia in the other quarterfinal, with
the winner most likely meeting the Americans in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   There are still indelible moments, however, when the game is
more of a show than a contest. When Carter dunked over Weis, he
said he felt as if he was literally flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to track and field last night and I was telling my mom
that I was itching to do it,'' he said. ``I just wanted to try it,
just to say I did it.''  &QL;

   Fall is the time for discounts in the Caribbean. From September
through early December, the Caribbean offers tremendous value and
relatively empty beaches. Of course, the threat of occasional
storms and even hurricanes is real and visitors should be aware
that their plans might have to alter if the weather deteriorates.
The Web site of the National Hurricane Center's Tropical Prediction
Center (www.nhc.noaa.gov) is the best way to monitor storms.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By BETTINA EDELSTEIN
 c. 2000 Bettina Edelstein
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)
<P>
   The ocean seemed calm, the voyage promising. Bits of blue peeked
from the mist around the spiky green and granite mountains, the
geological backbone of the Lofoten Islands of Norway, rising from
the water like the spine of some ancient sea creature.
</P>
<P>
   The boat was waiting in the Reine harbor, next to a small
warehouse where we could see and smell stacks of dried cod. We were
off to the end of Moskenesoya Island, the final jewel of this
archipelago 60 miles north of the Arctic Circle. It was to be a
pilgrimage of sorts, a trip back in time to a lonely spot where
painted figures some 3,000 years old danced on the walls of a cave.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one catch: the legendary maelstrom, the
Moskstraumen.
</P>
<P>
   Since at least the 16th century, seafarers and those inhabiting
their world, if only in the mind, have noted this tidal current,
said to be one of the strongest on Earth. Jules Verne, Edgar Allen
Poe and Herman Melville all wrote ominously about this maritime
monster, this ``whirlpool from which no vessel escapes,'' as Verne
described it.
</P>
<P>
   They exaggerated, yet the maelstrom is a force that commands
respect.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour into our journey, the sea turned suddenly and
violently choppy. Seriously seasick, a woman in the German party of
five aboard the boat staked out a spot aft and out of view. The
young man of the group, wearing an earring and a marijuana-leaf
charm on a chain around his neck, cracked open another beer and
lighted another hand-rolled cigarette. Would we go on? After a
brief consultation with the captain, our guide, Stig Einarsen,
returned to deck and told us we would have to turn back.
</P>
<P>
   Ashore in Reine, my partner, Bill, and I agreed that it was too
bad about the cave, but then again, we'd hardly planned on seeing
it. We didn't even know about it until we found a brochure in the
local tourist office. And so what if we had already spent the
morning on the water, on a four-hour ferry ride from the mainland?
Though we had two and a half weeks to explore Norway by car, we had
chosen the Lofotens as our priority destination, hoping for an
Arctic adventure. The country's famed fjords, we had decided, could
wait. And so, we figured, could the cave.
</P>
<P>
   The ferry we took with our rental car to Moskenes leaves from
Bodo, a 12-hour drive from Trondheim, Norway's historic capital.
The jagged mountains, known as the Lofotveggen, or Lofoten Wall,
are the first thing you see and they are startling. And thanks to
the Gulf Stream, the islands are green and lush though the water is
cold.
</P>
<P>
   In the Lofotens, cod rules, as it has for hundreds of years.
From the end of January to April, when the cod swim south from the
Barents Sea to spawn, life on the islands turns to the fishery,
which employs some 40 percent of the working population. Much of
the catch is turned into stockfish, dried cod, exported mainly to
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to get the flavor of the place is to stay in one of
the cabins, or ``rorbuer,'' originally built for fishermen and
updated to accommodate tourists. Ours was on the last stop on the
main road through the Lofotens, the E10, in a 19th-century village
called A (pronounced Aw), which also happens to be the last letter
of the Norwegian alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny village consists mainly of a cluster of red clapboard
rorbuer leading to a boardwalk with a restaurant by the harbor, and
a small supermarket, an 1844 bakery and a few historical museums
with displays on village life over the past 200 years. Each rorbu
has a name; ours, with a sliding door secured by a padlock, was
Anton.
</P>
<P>
   The little house, with living room and eat-in kitchen, cooking
implements and dishes, was sweet and tidy, with floor, ceiling and
wall paneled in blond wood, and a modern bathroom. The reception
office supplied linens. Though we'd planned to stay just two
nights, we immediately booked a third.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the Lofotens often stay a week or longer, mostly
during the peak season from June 15 to Aug. 15. Though some 250,000
people come to the islands during summer, the villages don't feel
crowded. At most, there's a relaxed kind of bustle.
</P>
<P>
   Many who do their holiday homesteading in the rorbuer dine on
fish they have caught and food they have brought or bought. Unlike
quaint A, Reine (population 700) is a real town. After our
encounter with the maelstrom, we headed for sustenance to a
restaurant just off the dock called Gammelbua and joined Stig, our
captain and his assistant for a few beers.
</P>
<P>
   When we left Gammelbua at 10 o'clock, the white night sky was
still filled with the promise of daylight. We could hear country
music as we stepped out into the crisp air and followed the sound
to the Brygga restaurant and bar on the village dock.
</P>
<P>
   As midnight edged in, people did, too. Because most Norwegians
speak English, it was easy to chat with those around us in the
dark, smoky bar _ some fishermen and another tour guide, whose
teenage son was busy on the dance floor. At one point, the talk
turned to the cave paintings, and we were urged not to miss this
marvel. Never mind the maelstrom, Stig said. In a Zodiac, a
motorized raft, we'd have no trouble. He would pick us up at our
dock at noon. Deal.
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs in the restaurant area we joined the crowd toasting,
buzzing, dancing. The hours had zoomed by, but the daylight outside
had warped our sense of time. At 3 a.m., the band quit, but the
music didn't. People sang an old Leadbelly tune, clapping and
thumping on tables.
</P>
<P>
   At noon the day looked gray. But changeable weather is part of
the Lofoten experience; you just go with it. We put on the
windbreaker jumpsuits Stig provided and roared off. In the Zodiac,
the maelstrom really was a cinch. Before long we were putting in at
the rocky shore of Refsvika, by a tiny coral beach, curious seals
popping up out of the water 25 or 30 yards away. Once there was a
small fishing village here, blessed with beauty, cursed with a poor
harbor. In 1951 the villagers took the government's cue and
abandoned the place, then as now, accessible only by boat.
</P>
<P>
   To get to the cave, we hiked a hilly trail, snacking on
crowberries we plucked from bushes. To our right was the sea, to
our left a row of mountains. For some 50 years, whenever the
weather kept the boats at harbor or the fishing kept the boats at
sea, children walked this path to the school in the next village,
on the other side of the mountains. At a certain crevice they would
swing across on a rope; a rope hangs there still.
</P>
<P>
   After trudging along for an hour or so, we came to the cave. The
entrance was some 150 feet high and 36 feet wide. Donning the
helmets that Stig took out of a wooden box just outside, we
followed him in. The space had the aura of a cathedral, with
soaring ceiling and chambers on either side. Flashlight in hand _
only guides may carry them, and no cameras are allowed _ Stig led
the way into one of the chambers. Just where the light from outside
began to fall into darkness, we stopped. There the red figures were
revealed.
</P>
<P>
   To describe them as stick figures is to understate their
humanity. They are rich with movement; at least one has a rounded
body. Very likely, the painters made the pigment from iron oxide
veins in the cave. But who painted them and why? Are the figures
moving into light or darkness? Do they tell of birth, spiritual or
otherwise, or the inevitable journey toward death?
</P>
<P>
   Awe-struck, we huddled on the rocks, whispering and listening to
the ancient plink of water on rock. ``I have been here many times,
but it is always special,'' Stig said. ``I am never bored with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   We stopped at a beach to eat lunch, and then it was time to go.
We were not long on the water when Stig turned the Zodiac into the
harbor of Hell (in Norwegian, ``helle'' means a flat place), where
another village once stood. In the old days children watched the
maelstrom from a cliff for entertainment. Hell also had Norway's
first radio telephone station. Built in 1928, it established
communication with Sorvagen, just up the road from A.
</P>
<P>
   Hell was green and peaceful. Yet it felt abandoned. Sea eagles
wheeled above us with fringed wings. But where were the puffins I
had read about? I had seen none along the rocky coasts they are
reputed to favor. Stig pointed to a flock of small black birds in
the distance. ``There,'' he said. ``Now you can say you have seen
the puffins.''

   For information on the Lofoten Islands, the tourist center's Web
site, www.lofoten-info.no, is very helpful. The tourist center
itself is in Sorvagen, three miles from the ferry in Moskenes; (47)
76 09 15 99; fax (47) 76 09 24 25.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE
</P>
<P>
   The departure point for the Lofoten Islands is the northern
Norwegian city of Bodo, 795 miles north of Oslo, accessible by
train, plane and car. By car, allow 12 hours from Trondheim on the
E6, one of the main roads in northern Norway. Bodo is the last stop
on the Norwegian railway, and there are daily trains from Trondheim
and Oslo; from Trondheim, it's a 10-hour ride. Fares vary; basic
cost without discount, $83.50, at 8.8 krone to the dollar. Call
Norwegian State Railways at (47) 81 50 08 88.
</P>
<P>
   You can also fly to Bodo and on to Leknes Airport on the island
of Vestvagoy, a half-hour flight from Bodo. For fares and
schedules, call SAS Scandinavian Airlines in the United States at
(800) 221-2350.
</P>
<P>
   The four-hour ferry trip from Bodo to Moskenes leaves four or
five times a day in summer. (The ferry runs all year.) One-way fare
is about $13 for pedestrians and $48 for cars, with driver. Park
your car in line about two hours before departure. For schedules
call OVDS, the steamship company: (47) 76 96 76 00 or fax (47) 76
11 82 01.

steamer, which takes four hours to Stamsund, on Vestvagoy in the
center of the Lofoten archipelago; for bookings call OVDS at (47)
76 96 76 00.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a daily express passenger boat takes four hours to
Svolvaer on Austvagoy farther north. Call to book ahead: (47) 75 54
17 41.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO STAY
</P>
<P>
   In A, rates for a rorbu (fisherman's cabin) vary from $40 to
$125 a night, depending on size and comfort level. At A Rorbuer, a
delightful cabin on the main boardwalk _ with two bedrooms that
could sleep up to eight, a living room, an eat-in kitchen and a
modern bathroom with shower _ costs about $100 a night. Two rental
agents for rorbuer in A are A Rorbuer, (47) 76 09 11 21, fax (47)
76 09 12 82, and A-Hamna Rorbuer, (47) 76 09 12 11, fax (47) 76 09
11 14.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO EAT
</P>
<P>
   Seafood dominates menus, with cod dishes a local specialty.
</P>
<P>
   Gammelbua, Reine; (47) 76 09 22 22. The signature dish of this
cozy restaurant by the harbor is stockfish stew in a tomato base
with thinly sliced potatoes and plump, juicy olives. Open for lunch
and dinner; closed Sept. 1 until mid-May. Dinner for two with beer,
around $65.
</P>
<P>
   Brygga, in A; (47) 76 09 15 72. Pretty views of the harbor
enhance seafood and other dishes for lunch and dinner in this
simple place; dinner for two with wine, $48. Closed Sept. 1 through
May, though groups can call for reservations year round.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT TO SEE
</P>
<P>
   Trips to Refsvikhula, the cave with the 3,000-year-old
paintings, can be arranged through the tourist office at (47) 76 09
15 99. A group excursion of about six hours leaves from Reine
harbor Mondays and Fridays from June 1 to Aug. 30 if a minimum of
six people sign up (trips are possible year round except in
December and January; call ahead to arrange); about $50 a person.
If the maelstrom is too fierce, the boat will turn back; in our
case, we were charged only a partial fare.
</P>
<P>
   A trip to the cave with a guide on a motorized raft can be
arranged through Adventure Rafting Lofoten; $67 a person (minimum
five people); daily mid-June to mid-August; rest of the year,
charter trips only. Call (47) 76 09 20 00 to book or the tourist
office.
</P>
<P>
   The Lofoten Stockfish Museum in A, (47) 76 94 81 29 18, has a
thorough exhibition on the production and trade of salt cod,
Norway's oldest export. Open weekdays June 6 to 20, 11 a.m. to 4
p.m.; daily June 21 to Aug. 20, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission $6.25.

</P>
<P>
   Lofotr, the Viking Museum, Borg; (47) 76 08 49 00. A bit farther
afield, but well worth the journey by bus or by car (a 49-mile
drive from A to the town of Borg on the island of Vestvagoy), this
museum is the site of the largest Viking Age house ever found. The
reconstructed chieftain's house has displays on Viking life with
people in costume Sand exhibits of Viking relics. On the

&HT;     TEXAS BAR REPORT CRITICIZES DEFENSE SYSTEM FOR POOR 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BONNIE PFISTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ A Texas Bar Association report found that while
the state leads the nation in executions of criminal defendants, it
trails much of the nation in providing services to poor people
accused of felony crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas is one of only five states that have no centralized
funding for the poor in criminal cases,'' with the exception of
death-row cases, said Allan K. Butcher, the co-author of the Bar
Association report.
</P>
<P>
   Butcher, a state district court magistrate in Fort Worth, added:
``We now have empirical evidence for what everybody had
suspected.''
</P>
<P>
   While national surveys say it costs about $60 per hour to
operate a modern law practice, the fees provided in Texas often
don't cover basic expenses for court-appointed lawyers, the report
contends.
</P>
<P>
   That puts an economic squeeze on small law practices. And larger
firms, the report says, tend to send associates with less
experience to defend the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys told those conducting they study they often
did not do their best for indigent clients, citing a lack of
resources and the need to focus on cases that provide an income.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting in Laredo on Friday, the State Bar's board of directors
accepted the report _ which was written by a committee of the Bar _
but refrained from endorsing or rejecting it.
</P>
<P>
   The board directed the committee to come up with recommendations
of how to better fund and compensate court-appointed attorneys, as
well as how they should be selected.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the bar said the committee would publicly take
up the issue at a December symposium in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Former bar chairman David Keltner said defense representation
for the poor should get as much funding as the state's district
attorneys' offices.
</P>
<P>
   It's a societal responsibility like paying school taxes, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought not to just saddle the individual attorneys with this
cost,'' Keltner said.
</P>
<P>
   Some alternatives include adopting a public defender system,
which some of Texas' largest cities have done in modified form.
</P>
<P>
   Keltner said bar members should put aside concerns about how
such a debate may affect Gov. George W. Bush's presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Democrat, but I'm sure if (Bush) saw this report he'd
agree these are serious concerns. This isn't a George Bush problem.
It existed well before him. It's above politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor last year vetoed legislation that would have given
county commissioners the power to adopt formal procedures for
indigent defense. Such a measure, Bush said at the time, would have
increased bureaucracy without improving representation.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it was well-intentioned, it was flawed,'' Bush
spokeswoman Linda Edwards. ``It would have taken authority away
from judges _ who are sworn to uphold justice and know best an
attorney's qualifications, and give it to elected county
commissioners.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, Edwards, added, the state has improved its
system by including the appointment of two attorneys to death
penalty cases, and state funding of $25,000 per case to lawyers for
representation during appeals.

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Sept. 26:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-NUKE-LASER (Undated) _ A giant laser was to allow bomb
makers to study the physics of nuclear weapons without exploding
them. It would also let engineers explore the possibility of
commercial power plants based on ``laser fusion,'' and would offer
scientists the chance to probe matter under conditions never before
created in a laboratory. But now, after a series of bungles,
federal financing is in serious doubt. By James Glanz.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CORN-BUTTERFLIES (Undated) _ In a finding that is being
hailed by the biotechnology industry and decried by environmental
activists, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a report last
week concluding that genetically modified corn is unlikely to pose
a serious threat to monarch butterflies. By Carol Kaesuk Yoon.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WEATHER-SURPRISES (Undated) _ After a record El Nino in 1997
and 1998, followed by a prolonged La Nina, the tropical Pacific has
shaken off its fever and chills and is expected for at least a year
to be ``normal.'' So one might think meteorologists could relax a
bit. But it's exactly the opposite, many of them say. The trouble
is that there is no strong organizing force giving shape to the
otherwise chaotic flow of weather across the seas and continents.
By Andrew C. Revkin.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BIRD-ENCYCLOPEDIA (Oak Bluffs, Mass.) _ A new definitive
encyclopedia of North American birds will be published soon. It
provides details and drawings never before found in a single place,
with each species drawn as it looks throughout its life, from above
and below. By E. Vernon Laux.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SHRIMP-BUBBLES (Undated) _ Scientists now can link the sound
of a snapping shrimp to the physics of a bubble. And the news comes
as a big surprise to experts in the field, who had always just
assumed the noise came from the claw snapping shut. By Kenneth
Chang.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HEALTH &AMP; FITNESS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MORNING-SICKNESS (Undated) _ In 1983, the morning sickness
drug Bendectin was removed from the market amid a barrage of
lawsuits claiming it caused birth defects. Now, in what medical and
legal experts say is an unprecedented reversal of fortune, it may
well be brought back. By Gina Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DIET-AGING (Undated) _ Despite a lack of evidence that very
low-calorie diets work to prolong the lives of humans, some people
are taking on the challenge, and getting very thin. By Eric
Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   With
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DIET-PROFILE (Undated) _ Leonard Guarente, a professor of
biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, had become a
connoisseur of failure in his research on the genes that control
aging. But lately, he has been enjoying a string of successes in
this long intractable field. Last week, after a nine-year pursuit,
he reported a finding that may explain exactly how calorically
restricted diets _ the one intervention known to prolong the lives
of experimental organisms _ may achieve that end. By Nicholas
Wade. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ATHLETES-DEPRESSION (Undated) _ When athletes, both
professionals and committed amateurs, are seriously injured,
depression often sets in. The research in this niche field of sport
psychology is limited. But one study of 343 male college athletes
from a variety of sports found that 51 percent had some symptoms of
depression after being injured, and 12 percent became moderately to
severely depressed.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ATTENTION-DEFICIT (Undated) _ Some experts are using
biofeedback to treat attention deficit disorders, and they have had
some positive results. But skeptics say the benefit is expensive
and may just be short-term. By Jim Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SINUS-FUNGUS (Undated) _ Some scientists have found fungi,
as in mushrooms, in the sinuses and have linked them to the chronic
condition known as sinusitis. By Gabrielle Glaser.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BREAST-CANCER (Undated) _ A review of the updated edition of
a highly regarded resource book, ``Breast Cancer: The Complete
Guide,'' by Dr. Yashar Hirshaut and Dr. Peter I. Pressman, which
provides both support and every scrap of information a woman needs
to get the right treatment from the right physician. Reviewed by
John Langone.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FOLK-REMEDIES (Undated) _ A review of ``More Chicken Soup
and Other Folk Remedies,'' by Joan Wilen and Lydia Wilen, which is
a fun read and, like mother's chicken soup, cannot hurt you and
might even help. Reviewed by John Langone.

   STONEMOUNTAIN _ STONE MOUNTAIN, Ga. _ To some who've never heard

must sound like a Vegas casino. To those who know the company

choice destinations for lovers of retired country music acts, Elvis
impersonators and outlet shopping - it's an amusement park operator
that's about to blight a Confederate monument and Mother Nature.
Ever since securing a lease to manage Stone Mountain Park

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ ``Ignorant folks,'' my
father used to say, ``are not stupid _ they're just uninformed in
some areas. Still, they're mighty good at finger-pointing and
name-calling. But,'' he'd remind me, ``always remember they're
voicing their own fears, not their knowledge.'' Over the years, I
must have heard this at least a hundred times. (Schuett, Cox News

   LANE-COLUMN _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Alexander Hamilton was not
nearly as likable as Ronald Reagan. He was vain, sneaky and had to
let everybody know he was the smartest guy in the room. Yeah, I
know: He laid the foundation for the American economic system and
kept the nation fiscally afloat when we were a mere start-up
venture. But born illegitimate and dead in a duel? And that nasty
negative campaign against Thomas Jefferson? And the hush money paid
after an adulterous affair? Is this a role model for children?

</P>
<P>
   WIGGNS-SCOUTS _Back when I was a Boy Scout in the mid-'50s, sex
hadn't been
</P>
<P>
   invented, much less homosexuality. Married folks procreated by
holding hands during Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movies. The Boy
Scout Manual did make some glancing reference to boys who were
troubled by impure thoughts and spent too much time alone brooding.
This didn't seem to apply to me and my Scouting buddies. We rather
enjoyed our impure thoughts, such as, ``Do Girl Scouts wear green
underthings?'' And if so, what assumptions can we make about
Brownies? (Wiggins, Palm Beach Post)

   MINOR-COLUMN _ I'm in shock, and it's not because W. was funny

<P>
   Oprah the other day, which he was. But W. is always funny when

Schwinn bikes and the Zenith TV console in the den. Ranch houses,
those rambling, low-slung houses of the '50s and '60s, hang on in
the 21st century as icons of suburbia, at its cookie-cutter worst
and its bucolic best. And now the moment of truth is arriving: Do

east of Interstate 35 in Temple, Texas. It's a pleasant but

oaks and deep overhanging eaves. But step inside, and it's another
story altogether. Bursting with shiny orange, turquoise, hot pink,
black and yellow surfaces, furnished with sleek appliances and
furniture, the home's interior looks like a home decor ad from the
Kennedy era. Ralph Wilson Sr., founder of Wilsonart International
plastics company, built the house in 1959 as his private home and a
showcase for his laminates, then an exotic new material not widely
used in homes. In 1998, it was named to the National Register of
Historic Places, and last year it received an award from the
National Trust for Historic Preservation. (JBSmith, Waco

``really show off'' (remember the way the Fonz wore his collar?),

 &HT;    27-YEAR-OLD HEALTH ADVISER A KEY PART OF GORE CAMPAIGN TEAM
 &HT;    690&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Vice President Al Gore isn't quite sure about
some obscure detail of his health care plan, he will end his
remarks with a fleeting, almost unnoticed question: ``Isn't that
right, Sarah?''
</P>
<P>
   A quick nod, a thumbs-up or a clenched fist in the air from the
fidgety young woman who always seems to be nearby means the
Democratic presidential nominee has nailed it. A few words of
clarification or some additional details means he was close _ but
not close enough for Sarah.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Bianchi, a 27-year-old Atlanta native, is deputy domestic
affairs adviser to the Gore campaign. But the title understates the
way Gore has come to depend on her.
</P>
<P>
   By the vice president's assessment, Bianchi is ``scary smart'' _
a walking, talking encyclopedia of the way he intends to run
federal health care programs if he is elected president this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``Medicare at the Crossroads,'' the 74-page booklet Gore
released at a St. Petersburg, Fla., campaign event Monday, was
largely produced by Bianchi this past weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But that booklet was just one item on her ``to do'' list before
heading back out on the campaign trail this week.
</P>
<P>
   She also briefed Gore campaign surrogates about the details of
the vice president's Medicare plan. And, at least as important
strategically, she helped pull together the information needed to
criticize competing proposals from Gore's rival, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Scary smart?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just scary,'' said Bianchi, with a quick laugh that punctuates
much of a conversation with her. It is an easy, natural laugh, not
at all in keeping with her constant fidgeting, a condition not
uncommon among the sleepless twenty-somethings on presidential
campaigns who are fueled by too many candy bars and Diet Cokes.
</P>
<P>
   The quick nod, the thumbs up, the clenched fist _ they are not
just signals to Gore. They are Bianchi's way of talking about
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my mania,'' she said. ``The vice president knows his
stuff. It's just incredible to me how much detail he knows, about
so many things. I'm just there if he has a question.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, she resembles a cheerleader, nearly jumping in the air
when the vice president responds exceptionally well to a question
at a town hall meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all exciting,'' she explained. ``I know that at some
point, I probably need to get a little more balance in my life. But
this is an unbelievable experience. And it's an honor to work on
issues that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Bianchi's interest in health care policy stems from her
childhood in Atlanta. She often accompanied her mother, Barbara, a
developmental psychologist, on visits to Henry W. Grady Hospital,
where she worked with children on Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Her interest in public service is rooted in the Paideia School.
The progressive private school was founded by children of the
1960s, including her father, Paul, the school's only headmaster, a
Boston native inspired by John F. Kennedy's call to service.
</P>
<P>
   The school made her ``very idealistic,'' she said. When she
wasn't playing basketball for the school team, she was tutoring
low-income children or coaching youth soccer and basketball teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really great growing up in the school community,''
Bianchi said. ``Sometimes I didn't like the idea of my father being
right around the Coke machine at school. But most of the kids
really liked him. And I only had one occasion where my date wanted
to drop me off a few blocks away from the house. He said he didn't
want to get any closer.''
</P>
<P>
   From Paideia, Bianchi went to Harvard University, where she
became friends with Karenna Gore, the vice president's eldest
child. Bianchi spent time enough time with the Gore family that she
became known as ``Sarah B.'' to distinguish her from Sara Gore, one
of Karenna's two sisters.
</P>
<P>
   A standout basketball player _ she once was Georgia High School
Player of the Month _ Bianchi has occasionally shot baskets with
the vice president. And proving that she has learned a lot about
politics, she insists that the vice president always won. ``That's
the right answer,'' she said with that quick laugh of hers.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But, ironically, it was Bill Clinton, not Al Gore, who
originally inspired Bianchi _ or rather, the Kennedyesque call to
service that Clinton incorporated into his campaign for the
presidency in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was telling young people that they could make a
difference,'' she said of Clinton. ``And for the first time in my
life, someone at the national level was talking about things that
resonated with me and with my life.''
</P>
<P>
   After Harvard, then, she became a White House intern. It was
1994, the government was being shut down, and like some many other
volunteers, she was thrown into tasks that she would otherwise
never had a chance to take on.
</P>
<P>
   Her talents were quickly recognized, and when a job came open in
the health care section of the White House Office of Management and
Budget, she was the first choice.
</P>
<P>
   She moved from OMB to the office of Bruce Reed, the director of
the president's Domestic Policy Council, again working on health
care. And in 1998, she moved to the vice president's office,
becoming his chief adviser on health care, eventually shifting over
to the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Klain, Gore's former chief of staff, hired Bianchi
without knowing her personal connections to the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me I could get in on the ground floor,'' she said,
noting the irony.
</P>
<P>
   Bianchi is quick to express the hurt and frustration she felt
over Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a White House
intern at the same time as Bianchi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough and, of course, disappointing,'' she said. ``But
now I find myself hoping that at the end of the day the country
will remember the good things about him, because I do believe he
accomplished a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   But being at the White House during Clinton's impeachment ``also
was a good lesson of staying focused and keeping positive things
coming out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lesson that has guided her through the bleakest times of
the Gore presidential campaign as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned a lot watching the vice president keep going,''
Bianchi said. ``There are a lot of ups and downs and there are a
lot of fair-weather friends in politics. But it's a four-quarter
game, and you've got to stick with your team when they are down.
And you just keep going, if you think you're right on the issues.''

   SCI-DIET-PROFILE (Undated) _ Leonard Guarente, a professor of
biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, had become a
connoisseur of failure in his research on the genes that control
aging. But lately, he has been enjoying a string of successes in
this long intractable field. Last week, after a nine-year pursuit,
he reported a finding that may explain exactly how calorically
restricted diets _ the one intervention known to prolong the lives
of experimental organisms _ may achieve that end. By Nicholas

 &HT;    27-YEAR-OLD HEALTH ADVISER A KEY PART OF GORE CAMPAIGN TEAM
 &HT;    690&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Vice President Al Gore isn't quite sure about
some obscure detail of his health care plan, he will end his
remarks with a fleeting, almost unnoticed question: ``Isn't that
right, Sarah?''
</P>
<P>
   A quick nod, a thumbs-up or a clenched fist in the air from the
fidgety young woman who always seems to be nearby means the
Democratic presidential nominee has nailed it. A few words of
clarification or some additional details means he was close _ but
not close enough for Sarah.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Bianchi, a 27-year-old Atlanta native, is deputy domestic
affairs adviser to the Gore campaign. But the title understates the
way Gore has come to depend on her.
</P>
<P>
   By the vice president's assessment, Bianchi is ``scary smart'' _
a walking, talking encyclopedia of the way he intends to run
federal health care programs if he is elected president this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``Medicare at the Crossroads,'' the 74-page booklet Gore
released at a St. Petersburg, Fla., campaign event Monday, was
largely produced by Bianchi this past weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But that booklet was just one item on her ``to do'' list before
heading back out on the campaign trail this week.
</P>
<P>
   She also briefed Gore campaign surrogates about the details of
the vice president's Medicare plan. And, at least as important
strategically, she helped pull together the information needed to
criticize competing proposals from Gore's rival, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Scary smart?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just scary,'' said Bianchi, with a quick laugh that punctuates
much of a conversation with her. It is an easy, natural laugh, not
at all in keeping with her constant fidgeting, a condition not
uncommon among the sleepless twenty-somethings on presidential
campaigns who are fueled by too many candy bars and Diet Cokes.
</P>
<P>
   The quick nod, the thumbs up, the clenched fist _ they are not
just signals to Gore. They are Bianchi's way of talking about
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my mania,'' she said. ``The vice president knows his
stuff. It's just incredible to me how much detail he knows, about
so many things. I'm just there if he has a question.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, she resembles a cheerleader, nearly jumping in the air
when the vice president responds exceptionally well to a question
at a town hall meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all exciting,'' she explained. ``I know that at some
point, I probably need to get a little more balance in my life. But
this is an unbelievable experience. And it's an honor to work on
issues that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Bianchi's interest in health care policy stems from her
childhood in Atlanta. She often accompanied her mother, Barbara, a
developmental psychologist, on visits to Henry W. Grady Hospital,
where she worked with children on Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Her interest in public service is rooted in the Paideia School.
The progressive private school was founded by children of the
1960s, including her father, Paul, the school's only headmaster, a
Boston native inspired by John F. Kennedy's call to service.
</P>
<P>
   The school made her ``very idealistic,'' she said. When she
wasn't playing basketball for the school team, she was tutoring
low-income children or coaching youth soccer and basketball teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really great growing up in the school community,''
Bianchi said. ``Sometimes I didn't like the idea of my father being
right around the Coke machine at school. But most of the kids
really liked him. And I only had one occasion where my date wanted
to drop me off a few blocks away from the house. He said he didn't
want to get any closer.''
</P>
<P>
   From Paideia, Bianchi went to Harvard University, where she
became friends with Karenna Gore, the vice president's eldest
child. Bianchi spent time enough time with the Gore family that she
became known as ``Sarah B.'' to distinguish her from Sara Gore, one
of Karenna's two sisters.
</P>
<P>
   A standout basketball player _ she once was Georgia High School
Player of the Month _ Bianchi has occasionally shot baskets with
the vice president. And proving that she has learned a lot about
politics, she insists that the vice president always won. ``That's
the right answer,'' she said with that quick laugh of hers.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But, ironically, it was Bill Clinton, not Al Gore, who
originally inspired Bianchi _ or rather, the Kennedyesque call to
service that Clinton incorporated into his campaign for the
presidency in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was telling young people that they could make a
difference,'' she said of Clinton. ``And for the first time in my
life, someone at the national level was talking about things that
resonated with me and with my life.''
</P>
<P>
   After Harvard, then, she became a White House intern. It was
1994, the government was being shut down, and like some many other
volunteers, she was thrown into tasks that she would otherwise
never had a chance to take on.
</P>
<P>
   Her talents were quickly recognized, and when a job came open in
the health care section of the White House Office of Management and
Budget, she was the first choice.
</P>
<P>
   She moved from OMB to the office of Bruce Reed, the director of
the president's Domestic Policy Council, again working on health
care. And in 1998, she moved to the vice president's office,
becoming his chief adviser on health care, eventually shifting over
to the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Klain, Gore's former chief of staff, hired Bianchi
without knowing her personal connections to the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me I could get in on the ground floor,'' she said,
noting the irony.
</P>
<P>
   Bianchi is quick to express the hurt and frustration she felt
over Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a White House
intern at the same time as Bianchi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough and, of course, disappointing,'' she said. ``But
now I find myself hoping that at the end of the day the country
will remember the good things about him, because I do believe he
accomplished a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   But being at the White House during Clinton's impeachment ``also
was a good lesson of staying focused and keeping positive things
coming out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lesson that has guided her through the bleakest times of
the Gore presidential campaign as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned a lot watching the vice president keep going,''
Bianchi said. ``There are a lot of ups and downs and there are a
lot of fair-weather friends in politics. But it's a four-quarter
game, and you've got to stick with your team when they are down.
And you just keep going, if you think you're right on the issues.''

FAREWELL, TINSELTOWN! ADIEU, LA-LA LAND! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 1)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``If she was wearing a revealing top,'' wrote The Los Angeles
Times in a guide to the geographic origins of guests at a Conga
Room party during the Democratic National Convention, ``a short,
tight micro-mini and strappy stilettos, if she had that come-hither
look, she was definitely  &UR; Left Coast &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   When did the West Coast of the United States become the  &UR; Left
Coast &LR; , and why?
</P>
<P>
   The East Coast is rarely called the Right Coast; its only
synonym is the Eastern Seaboard, as in ``We ought to saw off the
Eastern Seaboard and float it out to sea,'' 1960s hyperbole
attributed to Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona, who considered the
Rockefeller-Dewey Northeast to be a hotbed of liberalism.
( &UR; Seaboard &LR;  means ``land bordering a seacoast,'' though ``Western
Seaboard'' is an unfamiliar term.)
</P>
<P>
   The earliest  &UR; Left Coast &LR;  citation I can find, with the help of
Fred Shapiro of Yale, is in the title of a 1977 Rolling Stone
record review: ``Wet Willie  &UR; Left Coast &LR;  Live.'' Three years later,
a New York Times writer put it in context: ``If you're standing in
Texas looking north, as Texans frequently do, the  &UR; Left Coast &LR;  is
where Hollywood is.'' These usages had no political connotation.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-'90s, however, a liberal coloration emerged. The
Denver Post noted that President Clinton ``swayed to the  &UR; left
coast &LR;  and invited gays into the military.''
</P>
<P>
   The combination of geographical and political direction was
irresistible. ``The Pacific Northwest was a center of so much
outcry against the Reagan administration in the 1980s,'' wrote Joel
Connelly in The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, ``that conservative
pundits referred to the region by a derisive nickname _ the ` &UR; left
coast &LR;  of America.'''
</P>
<P>
   As California has become more solidly Democratic, the name _
with its political connotation _ is most closely associated with
that state. (Oregon and Washington are still up for linguistic
grabs.)
</P>
<P>
   Other nicknames for Los Angeles and Hollywood, home of the
 &UR; glitterati &LR;  (an amalgam of ``glitter'' and ``literati''), seem to
be fading. `` &UR; Tinseltown &LR; , with its reference to the silver screen
and the glamour surrounding it, is at least mildly positive,'' says
Arnold Zwicky, visiting professor of linguistics at Stanford.
`` &UR; La-La Land &LR; , with its suggestion of kookiness, is (mildly,
jokingly) deprecatory, and I don't think I've heard Angelenos use
it except in explicit self-mockery.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; La-La Land &LR;  is a play on the initials L.A., perhaps influenced
by  &UR; Lotos-land &LR;  in ``The Lotos-Eaters,'' a poem by Tennyson: ``In
the hollow  &UR; Lotos-land &LR;  to live and lie reclined/On the hills like
Gods together.'' In his 1941 novel, ``The Last Tycoon,'' F. Scott
Fitzgerald had a character describe Hollywood as ``a mining town in
 &UR; lotus land &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Smith of The Los Angeles Times tracked  &UR; La-La Land &LR;  back to
a 1985 recording, ``Land of La-La,'' by Stevie Wonder, the pop-soul
music star, with backup singers chanting  &UR; el-lay &LR;  every few bars.
</P>
<P>
   The only uses found before that were a 1979 L.A. Times lead,
``Monday night in  &UR; Lalaland &LR;  is not like Monday night in, say,
Washington,'' and a 1984 reference in The Washington Post by the
fashion columnist Nina Hyde, reporting on a bar that ``encourages
the cocktail waitresses to pour themselves into black super-clingy
spandex pants, very  &UR; LA-LA land &LR; , very Cher of a couple of years
ago, very roller disco.''
</P>
<P>
   A second sense exists, only tangentially related to the city: a
state of unreality, induced by drink, drugs or congenital
dreaminess.
</P>
<P>
   Whether used derisively by unappreciative visitors to the Golden
State or used self-mockingly by residents, when the nicknames refer
to a specific place, they are proper nouns to be properly
capitalized:  &UR; Tinseltown &LR; ,  &UR; La-La Land &LR;  and now the  &UR; Left Coast &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   PACKAGE DEAL
</P>
<P>
   In the Left Coast convention speech introducing himself to the
nation, Sen. Joseph Lieberman said: ``My dad lived in an orphanage
when he was a child. He went to work in a bakery truck and then
owned a  &UR; package store &LR;  in Stamford, Conn.''
</P>
<P>
   The week before, however, in a speech to the AFL-CIO convention
in Hartford, Conn., Lieberman used the phrase  &UR; liquor store &LR; .
Crawford Lincoln of Brimfield, Mass., asks, ``Was this a gentler
locution to soften the image of his family's business for a
national audience?''
</P>
<P>
   I'd say yes, and thereby hangs a euphemism. A  &UR; package store &LR;  is
a store, not a bar, where liquor is sold by the bottle and not by
the drink and where the contents of the ``package'' are consumed
off premises.
</P>
<P>
   In 1880, Bradstreet's weekly reported active trade in  &UR; package
houses &LR; . In 1890, The London Daily News reported that ``Judge
Foster recently decided that liquor could only be sold in `original
packages,' which is construed as meaning one or more bottles of
beer or whisky. The merchants ... are not allowed to sell beer or
whisky by the glass.''
</P>
<P>
   Our earliest evidence for the phrase  &UR; package store &LR; , I am
informed by Joanne Despres at Merriam-Webster, ``is an entry in the
1918 Addenda to the New International Dictionary (originally
published in 1909), where it is labeled `cant, U.S.''' ( &UR; Cant &LR; 
means ``jargon,'' and business euphemisms fall into that category.)
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it: What the seller is selling is not a package but
what is contained in the package, which is liquor. Why the
squeamishness about that word? After Prohibition was repealed in
1933, state legislatures had the opportunity to license booze shops
and saloons but did not want to upset the many ``drys.'' That led
to the linguistic prettification of saloons as  &UR; taverns &LR;  and of
shops purveying the mother's milk of John Barleycorn as  &UR; package
stores &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the senator uses the terms interchangeably. But I have a
hunch that some politically sensitive soul remembered that ``drys''
still exist and vote, and changed the candidate for vice
president's word from  &UR; liquor &LR;  to  &UR; package &LR; . It shows a
sandpapered-fingertip sensitivity to the shades of meaning of
words.

   ``Long" befor`e the ``celluloid" c`entury ended, it was clear
that this
would be the digital century. This is not fresh news. But Hollywood
catching up with the latest image delivery system is news, and the first
step has been taken with Mike Figgis`s ``Time Code.`` It arrives as four
separate stories shot in real time, projected simultaneously on a quadruple
split screen. Split screen techniques have been around since silent movies.
Digital video cameras, while more recent, are no longer novel. What feels
new about ``Time Code`` is the way Figgis puts them together, the way this
new technical tool brings to the feature film experience something of the
spontaneity of breaking news on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Lighter, faster, cheaper digital videocams have only just begun
to
democratize filmmaking and expand its possibilities. Next year we`ll see
how a Hollywood blockbuster looks when it`s shot this way in George Lucas`s
second ``Star Wars`` prequel. One thing that seems certain is that it will
be nothing like ``Time Code.`` Figgis is an envelope-pusher from way back.
Apart from whatever equipment is being employed, there`s the all-important
matter of the sensibility behind the camera. Also, the expressive ends to
which the new possibilities are put.
</P>
<P>
   Figgis`s four most recent films _ ``Leaving Las Vegas,`` ``One
Night
Stand,`` ``The Loss of Sexual Innocence,`` and ``Miss Julie`` _ have in
common an in-your-face intimacy and a strong pull away from linear
narrative. The four story strands unreeling concurrently in ``Time Code``
eliminate the usual editing problem of how to cut them together. Or, rather
they turn each audience member into his or her own editor.
</P>
<P>
   At first it`s a little confusing tracking each of the story
strands.
But surprisingly quickly we get a line on who`s who and what they`re up to
before they begin moving into other quadrants (as Buster Keaton`s
projectionist did in ``Sherlock Jr.``) and begin interacting, whereupon the
more complex relationships linking them become clear and the mysteries
vanish, to be replaced by the question of where the characters are going to
go once we have followed them to the present moment.
</P>
<P>
   In the upper right hand corner we see a tense woman (Saffron
Burrows)
in a therapy session. Below her, a film production team meeting struggles
to take shape while awaiting the small company`s big cheese (Stellan
Skarsgard). In the lower left hand corner a coke-snorting security guard
(Danny Huston) scopes out a masseur (Julian Sands), due at the same
meeting. In the upper left hand corner an ambitious actress (Salma Hayek)
also headed to the meeting has a jangly conversation with the woman she`s
living with (Jeanne Tripplehorn). Put them all together, they spell
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   We`re hooked. We want to see who`s going to make trouble for
whom, and
how, as they converge on the building housing the production company.
Although one form of Hollywood self-love is reflected in a long string of
movies satirizing the movie biz, ``Time Code`` doesn`t seem so much bent on
satire as on inviting us to share what it puts forth as a series of givens
about its sleaziness, its duplicity (especially sexual), and its pervasive
emotional and moral instability. The raw propulsiveness of the video
technique lends itself ideally to the highly provisional worlds these
characters inhabit.
</P>
<P>
   The material often amounts to no more than sketchy melodrama.
Sometimes
the improvisations, of which ``Time Code`` mostly consists, fire blanks.
Sometimes they seem shoehorned into forced lurid climaxes by plot
exigencies rather than organic outgrowths of character and action. In other
words, much of what we`re watching is claptrap. But, like a good
supermarket tabloid, ``Time Code`` grabs _ and keeps _ our attention. Some
characters inevitably emerge more satisfyingly than others. As the behavior
of the more extreme characters escalates, not always convincingly, my
sympathy grew for the harried execs played by Steven Weber and Holly
Hunter, neither high enough on the food chain to indulge themselves as some
of the others, gamely trying to keep the movie on track.

DON'T EAT THE ART: IF IT'S WAYNE THIEBAUD, YOU'LL BE TEMPTED
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ANDREW MARTON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Stand in front of almost any of Wayne
Thiebaud's art and even the most dour, jaded observer can't avoid
cracking a smile. In work after buoyant work, Thiebaud creates an
innocent and playful world where the commonplace levitates to grand
status thanks to pure color and singular form.
</P>
<P>
   Running like a vein through the Modern Art Museum of Fort
Worth's exhibit, ``Wayne Thiebaud: A Paintings Retrospective,'' is
warm sentiment and nostalgia that miraculously avoids sticky-bun
treacliness. The Modern's show, which opened Sunday, uses 100 major
oils, watercolors and pastels to chart the upbeat artistic
expressiveness of Thiebaud, who became all but synonymous with the
West Coast branch of New York's ``pop art'' scene of the 1960s
through his Norman Rockwell-meets-Andy Warhol evocations of the
everyday.
</P>
<P>
   Though the exhibition (organized by the Fine Arts Museums of San
Francisco) is technically a retrospective (the first of its kind in
20 years) of Thiebaud's five decades of work, it is hardly an
artistic elegy. Indeed, the Modern's exhibit, culled from numerous
museum and small-gallery collections along with several private
holdings, also acts as a wet kiss celebrating Thiebaud's 80th
birthday and his continued output of important work.
</P>
<P>
   However warmly conceived this winning exhibit is, though, it is
not without its flaws. As Thiebaud is something of a stubborn
stylist, shying away from experimentation, this self-reflexive
consistency produces a kind of predictability that is ultimately
salvaged from dullness by his exuberant use of color and texture.
</P>
<P>
   Other stylistic pockmarks include Thiebaud's occasional choice
of placing warmly homespun objects or human subjects inside
antiseptic cages of horizontal lines (notably in 1969's ``Candy
Counter''), clouding the sunny disposition of his subject matter.
And Thiebaud's rare excursion into group portraiture, 1965's ``Five
Seated Figures,'' is an off-putting scene, either plucked from a
very awkward family reunion, or a jury room of zombies.
</P>
<P>
   One might also cavil with Thiebaud's almost childish reluctance
to put conventional perspective into his works. But that qualm
would fail to consider that Thiebaud's art takes childlike pleasure
in paint's visceral qualities and the act of painting as catharsis.
</P>
<P>
   Thiebaud applies his colors with eye-candy glee, with
grandiloquent strokes tinted coral and plum, kiwi and vanilla
custard. In one work alone, 1966's ``Rabbit,'' he gives all
contemporary artists an advanced tutorial in transforming a
two-dimensional painting into a three-dimensional, tactile form.
The rabbit's fur is so lush, it is positively petable. (But, hey,
don't try it.)
</P>
<P>
   From Thiebaud's first paintings on display, dating from the
mid-1950s, he shows an unapologetic allegiance to romanticizing the
mundane. 1961's ``Five Hot Dogs'' significantly kicks off
Thiebaud's infatuation with the simple _ and the very edible.
</P>
<P>
   Before moving to the dessert portion of Thiebaud's movable
feast, one should remember that the artist made a brief
professional detour into the food-service industry which, perhaps,
created his fascination for culinary presentation. In ``Salad,
Sandwiches and Dessert,'' there is an almost military precision to
the food lineup with its armada of avocados, finger sandwiches,
parfaits and melons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pies, Pies, Pies'' lays out a parade of cherry, pumpkin, spice
and lemon meringue treats with such loose-limbed accuracy that one
is tempted to skim a finger right through Thiebaud's gossamer layer
of painted meringue. (Again, don't.) And the artist's brush strokes
are so hefty in ``Around the Cake'' that he could very well have
used a pastry bag to apply his oils.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cream Soups,'' from 1963, is the perfect illustration of how
Thiebaud served as the pop art world's anti-Andy Warhol. While
Warhol was submerged in the detached irony of the deadpan observer,
satirizing the pure iconography of such marketing staples as the
Campbell's soup can, Thiebaud dipped into the can's contents. His
strokes all but swirled the creaminess into the tomato and pea
soups depicted.
</P>
<P>
   But all is not sweetness and light in Thiebaud's view of a
pantry's contents. In ``Caged Pie,'' he confines the delectability
of the depicted pie into a harsh horizontal box that has all the
appetizing appeal of a laboratory petri dish.
</P>
<P>
   Ever present in all of Thiebaud's work, from the 1960s forward,
is his adroit pairing of simple subjects with their shadow
doppelgangers. In ``Star Pinball,'' the game machine has white and
baby blue legs yet its shadow is royal blue. In 1963's ``Revue
Girl,'' Thiebaud's leggy performer wears long white gloves and an
eggshell-toned outfit that inexplicably _ yet perfectly _ casts a
shadow of splattered taupe.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the shadows is Thiebaud's fondness for almost
cartoonlike outlines, a preference perhaps owing something to the
artist's brief period as a Walt Disney animator. In ``Bikini,'' he
traces the woman's form in faint neon blues, greens and yellows.
</P>
<P>
   Thiebaud's portraits highlight the artist's technical strengths
and some of the jarringly contradictory effects resulting from his
prodigious technique. The slightly befuddled expression displayed
in ``Portrait of Sterling Holloway'' and the ethereal aura
surrounding ``Betty Jean Thiebaud and Book'' are as gorgeous as
anything Thiebaud has produced.
</P>
<P>
   But not all of Thiebaud's portraits are accessible and inviting.
There is a chilliness to his ``Five Seated Figures'' that seems a
celebration of anomie at a WASP cocktail party. And the air around
``Woman in Tub'' is almost clinical, inspiring thoughts of an
autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1970s onward, Thiebaud's excursions outside the cozy
confines of the pantry yielded uneven results. With a witty glint
in his eye, the artist's ``24th Street Intersection,'' ``18th
Street Downgrade'' and ``Hill Street (Day City),'' all exaggerate
the famously plunging inclines and clinging houses lining San
Francisco's streets and freeways clogged with cars. But the
gravitationally challenged streetscapes, in addition to the aerial
perspective Thiebaud chooses for 1993's ``Apartment View'' and
``Wide Downstreet,'' is an impersonal vantage point, a radical
shift from the intimacy Thiebaud created with his culinary and
family portraits.
</P>
<P>
   But just as one bemoans Thiebaud's traffic-helicopter-viewpoint
of San Francisco, and as one begins to suspect that the artist has
_ late in his creative life _ lurched into a distant observer mode,
he creates ``Bakery Case.'' Painted only four years ago, this work
transports both the painter and, ultimately, this exhibit, back to
the domestically intimate territory of food, sensually portrayed
and celebrated as primal nourishment for both eye and soul.

   EQUESTRIAN: FALLS AND FAULTS
</P>
<P>
   Slippery footing and a touch of stage fright took a toll on the
U.S. show jumping squad Monday in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Rhythmical, ridden by Nona Garson of Lebanon, N.J., fell on a
turn during the qualifying round, eliminating her from the
individual event. The horse and the rider were unhurt and will be
in the team event Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done this sport for a long time,'' Garson said. ``You can
be a queen or you can be on the ground in a heartbeat. It hasn't
stopped me before, and it won't stop me here.''
</P>
<P>
   Her teammates also knocked down a lot of rails, and so did just
about every other rider.
</P>
<P>
   ``My round was not as nice as I hoped for,'' said Margie
Goldstein Engle of Wellington, Fla., who took down four rails on
Perin to score 16 faults. ``It means I have a little more homework
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 18,000 scared some of the horses, including the
mare Liberty, ridden by Laura Kraut of Oconomowoc, Wis., who
lowered two fences for eight faults.
</P>
<P>
   Clasiko, ridden by Lauren Hough of Ocala, Fla., scored 12.5
faults.
</P>
<P>
   Jeroen Dubbeldam of the Netherlands, on Sjiem, and Bruce Goodin
of New Zealand, on Lenaro, had the day's best rounds with only half
a fault each.
</P>
<P>
   There are three equestrian events _ show jumping, dressage and
three-day _ with team and individual medals in each. The United
States won individual gold and team bronze last week in three-day,
the equestrian equivalent of the decathlon.

<P>
   VOLLEYBALL: BRAZIL REMAINS UNBEATEN
</P>
<P>
   Brazil completed a perfect 5-0 run through Group A by defeating
Cuba Monday in three grueling games, 28-26, 30-28, 25-18. Giovanne
Gavio had 10 kills and the 19-year-old star Dante Amaral had nine
for the Brazilians, who will play Argentina (2-3) in the
quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba dropped to third in Group A by losing a tie breaker to the
Netherlands. Both teams went 4-1, but the Dutch had a better record
in games won versus games lost. The Netherlands, the 1996 gold
medalist, closed out group play by getting past Spain, 25-18,
25-17, 25-26, 25-21. The Spanish hitter Rafael Pascual had 27
kills. The Dutch advanced to play Yugoslavia (2-3), which
eliminated South Korea, 24-26, 25-20, 25-23, 19-25, 15-8. The South
Koreans, playing the best defense of the tournament, lost two
five-gamers.
</P>
<P>
   Spain (1-4) was eliminated when Australia beat Egypt, 25-17,
25-23, 25-22, later Monday. The victory by the Australians (1-3)
put them in the quarterfinals against Italy, marking a stunning
Olympic debut for a program that started from nothing in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Russia clinched second place in Group B by defeating Argentina,
25-23, 25-15, 25-20. Roman Yakovlev had 13 kills and Igor Chulepov
11 for the Russians (4-1). Russia will play the Cubans in the best
matchup of the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   In the meaningless late match, Italy defeated the United States,
21-25, 25-18, 25-18, 25-18. Italy, the favorite to win gold, had
sealed first place in Group B with a victory over Russia two days
earlier. Italy rested four of its regular starters, including the
stars Samuele Papi and Andrea Gardini.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the United States (0-5) finished tied for 11th, its
worst showing at an Olympics and the only time it has failed to win
at least once. The United States finished ninth in Atlanta in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably more disappointing because of the exposure that
the Olympics bring, and the opportunity it presents,'' Coach Doug
Beal said. ``Especially for a sport that doesn't get that much
exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the team had learned in the tournament, Erik Sullivan
said, ``It's tough to really say right now if we've learned
anything, except how to take a beating in the Olympics.''

</P>
<P>
   RATINGS BLUES AT NBC
</P>
<P>
   With each successive day bringing more disappointing ratings for
his taped Summer Olympic production, Dick Ebersol, the chairman of
NBC Sports, said he has not demanded that schedules be altered to
let the network carry track and field live in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1995, before we bought the rights, we knew there would
be no adjustments because Australia felt these Olympics would be
for the 19 million Australians to go home to watch in prime time,''
Ebersol said Monday. ``They've always been the ones who've watched
the Olympics in the morning or the middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol insisted that he would have gotten nowhere if he had
demanded changes because NBC's $705 million rights fee represents
the single largest investment by a broadcaster or sponsor involved
with the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Playing the network Bigfoot wouldn't have worked had he
approached the International Amateur Athletic Federation when NBC's
first few days' ratings were foundering. The federation controls
the Olympic track and field schedule, and scheduled the best races
to coincide with prime time for the Australian Seven Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the people running these Games, and they weren't going
to change,'' Ebersol said. ``This country invested $10 billion into
these Games, which makes $705 million look small. We had absolutely
no flexibility in our contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Any hasty changes to the second week's track and field schedule
would have created havoc for ticket-holders. To move an event that
was shown live at 8 p.m. in Sydney into prime time for NBC would
have required moving it at least six hours earlier to be seen at 11
p.m. Eastern time, which is 15 hours behind Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't change anything for any networks,'' said Giorgio
Renieri, a spokesman for the federation. ``There's been no request
from NBC, and we wouldn't change anything. We've changed the
schedule for competitive reasons, but not for television reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Through nine days of swimming, gymnastics and the start of track
and field, NBC's 14.6 prime-time Nielsen rating is 9.3 percent
below its guarantee to advertisers of a 16.1 rating, which has
caused the network to provide free commercial time to its
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The Summer Olympics rating is down 35 percent from the 1996
Atlanta Games, 22 percent from the 1992 Games in Barcelona, Spain,
and 18 percent from the 1988 Games in Seoul, South Korea.
</P>

   The ninth day of the Olympics produced a 13.5 rating, on a
Saturday night that included Michael Johnson's 400-meter
quarterfinal race. Each rating point equals 1.01 million television
households.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol continues to believe that the ratings are down because
economics forced NBC to expand to a 7 p.m. to midnight Eastern
schedule, and miscalculated the impact of Olympic Games played in
September, when viewers have less available time than in the
summer.
</P>

   He is less certain of the magnitude of the impact of the
Internet.

   MOTHS HAVE EVENT OF THEIR OWN
</P>
<P>
   As television cameras high above Olympic Stadium pull back to
reveal the magnificent panorama below, the first thing a viewer
notices may be the moths. Hundreds of thousands of them, jammed
almost wing to wing around the stadium lights, appear on television
like shimmering stars.
</P>
<P>
   They are Bogong moths, distracted from their southward migration
through New South Wales to the Bogong region of Alpine National
Park, near the Murray River in northern Victoria. Along the way,
the moths will be guests of honor at the annual Mungabareena
Ngan-Girra Festival, formerly known as the Bogong Moth Festival,
where Aboriginal Australians will celebrate their return, and eat
quite a few of them.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney's Olympic organizers consider the moths pests, and they
find it necessary to announce at night baseball games that the huge
moths are harmless. The lights at Olympic Stadium are an even
bigger temptation, and stadium managers will dim the field lights
and turn off the external stadium lights at midnight rather than at
3 a.m. to encourage the moths' departure. Jayne Pearce, a
spokeswoman for the track and field events, said that no athletes
had complained, but that the cleaning staff has been instructed to
pay special attention to moth carcasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they die, they tend to create a bit of a mess,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Grown Bogong moths have two-inch wingspans, and they swoop down
on startled fans, then rest on pants or shirts. Aborigines found
the moths to be a reliable source of food.
</P>
<P>
   The most common Bogong moth recipe includes roasting in heated
sand and hot ashes, then sometimes grinding the bodies into a
powder and making it into cakes. Variations include Bogong and
popcorn (just what it sounds like) or an old Qantas airline
specialty, Bogong moth toast.

THREE NEW FILMS AIM TO REVIVE THE CINEMATIC MUSICAL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By TODD CAMP 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can Nicole Kidman, Joel Grey and Bjork sell the old song and
dance on screen?
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the disappointing box-office response to ``The
Five Heartbeats'' _ Robert Townsend's ambitious 1991 attempt to
bring back big-screen musical drama _ the actor-director told the
Fort Worth Star-Telegram: ``I'm just not sure people know how to
watch a musical anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, audiences haven't had much of a chance to
learn. After the financial failure of several big-budget Hollywood
musicals, from original efforts like ``Newsies'' to the big-screen
adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Broadway hit ``Evita,'' it
seems as if the only folks capable of pulling off a dramatic
show-stopping tune are cartoon characters. But even though the
movie musical has been declared DOA at the box office, it still has
proponents. And Hollywood, with three studio efforts waiting in the
wings, hasn't given up on the genre just yet.
</P>
<P>
   Fine Line's ``Dancer in the Dark,'' due in theaters Oct. 6,
stars Scandinavian pop songstress Bjork as an immigrant, single-mom
factory worker who takes refuge from life's drudgery by imagining
herself in Hollywood musicals.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's big-budget Christmas Day release, ``Moulin Rouge,''
centers on the fact-based story of Henri Toulouse-Lautrec and his
circle of Bohemian friends, with Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman
belting out old standards.
</P>
<P>
   And MGM's ``The Fantasticks,'' based on the long-running Harvey
Schmidt and Tom Jones musical, comes to the big screen with former
``Cabaret'' master of ceremonies Joel Grey and former New Kid on
the Block Joe McIntyre. It's already playing New York and LA,
though there are no plans for wider release.
</P>
<P>
   Three new musicals, with at least one _ ``Moulin Rouge'' _
getting serious studio marketing support. But is there an audience?
</P>
<P>
   Composer Alan Menken thinks not. Menken found box-office success
with Frank Oz's 1986 adaptation of his off-Broadway sensation
``Little Shop of Horrors,'' not to mention his countless
Oscar-winning contributions to Disney's mega-blockbuster animated
musicals. But his only other live-action musical effort, 1992's
``Newsies,'' was a critical and box-office disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world has changed since ``Little Shop of Horrors.''
There's almost no going back to that,'' Menken says. Though a
rushed production schedule and poor reviews were factors in the
quick demise of ``Newsies,'' an extravagant production about a
turn-of-the-century strike by New York newspaper boys, Menken says
the studio's defeatist attitude about the genre played a major
role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what Disney Studios can do when they believe in
something, and they clearly made a decision to let this one sink or
swim on its own,'' Menken says. ``I spoke to Jeffery (Katzenberg),
and he said, `I could walk out into the street and throw $10
million into the air, too. I don't think it's going to make any
difference. ... I just think it's a movie nobody wants to see.
Next!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newsies'' featured the kind of dramatic, emotionally driven,
score-based music that makes for great live theater _ but falls
flat on screen, where audiences have been conditioned to expect
gritty realism. For a movie musical to have a chance today, many
believe it must be a comedy, like ``Little Shop'' and the ultimate
cult classic, ``The Rocky Horror Picture Show,'' which will
celebrate its 25th anniversary with an Oct. 3 release on DVD. It
also helps if the music isn't traditional musical-theater fare, but
rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three major movie successes in the genre _ ``Rocky
Horror,'' ``Grease'' and ``Little Shop of Horrors'' _ ``if you
dissect the music and the lyric, it's pretty much '50s, which is
bubble-gum pop _ really the breakthrough of pop-rock music,'' says
``Rocky Horror'''s executive producer, Lou Adler.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences have simply lost the ability to take legitimate
musicals seriously on screen, Adler says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the '30s and '40s were maybe the end of it,'' he says.
``With animation, you can get away with anything, absolutely
anything. But when you stop in a (live-action) film and you sing
something that's supposed to emotionally get to that audience, I
think you lose 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Which might explain why television has mined the innate
silliness of the musical form successfully in memorable bits on
shows such as ``Ally McBeal'' and ``The Drew Carey Show,'' while
falling on its face with more serious efforts such as Steven
Bochco's ``Cop Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, however, lays all the blame on moviegoers' modern
sensibilities. ``We really just lost the ability to make (musicals)
with a complete commitment,'' says Joel Ferrell, artistic director
for Casa Manana Musicals. ``Let's not `nudge, nudge, wink, wink' or
comment on them, let's just do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with just doing it, though, is that it goes against
the grain of today's prized filmmaking skills. With the refocusing
of directorial talents toward MTV-style, quick-cut editing _
combined with the intense pressure filmmakers feel to get each
project done and out into the market yesterday _ Ferrell says
Hollywood is simply out of step with what it takes to make a good
musical.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just aren't patient enough,'' he says. ``There's not
enough money in any budget to spend months and months preparing,
especially when you can just shift it to the editors and crank up
the computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrell _ no stranger to directing musicals, having mounted
successful productions of ``Annie,'' ``Carousel,'' ``Peter Pan''
and, most recently, Casa's ``The King &AMP; I'' _ refers back to the
heyday of movie musicals, when a perfectionist such as Gene Kelly
would work Debbie Reynolds until her feet bled to get the dance
sequences perfect for ``Singin' in the Rain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to capture some of the exhilaration (of a
live performance). When you chop a dance segment to little bits (in
the editing room), you just say to the audience that this is all
trickery,'' he says. ``Which is why MTV cracks me up. You have a
whole new breed of dancers who can't dance more than 15 seconds of
choreography at a time.''

LONG RANGE ECOLOGICAL LINKS AND A TRIP TO PLUTO POSTPONED 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FATES OF WOLF AND ASPEN TREES LINKED
</P>
<P>
   The hip bone's connected to the thigh bone, as the old
children's song goes, and in ecology, things are tied together as
well. The latest case in point comes from Yellowstone National
Park, where researchers suggest that a sharp decline in aspen trees
over the past century can be linked to the elimination of wolves.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, from Oregon State University, have been
studying the decline in aspen groves in the park, using historical
documents, aerial photographs and ring-dating. As they report in
the journal Biological Conservation, they determined that for more
than a century and a half, until the late 1920s, young trees were
able to survive and mature within existing groves. Things changed
around the time that the wolves in and around the park were
eliminated (the last wolves were seen in 1926).
</P>
<P>
   Here is the connection, as theorized by the researchers. Wolves
are natural predators of elk, and elk like to munch on aspen
suckers in the winter, stunting the trees. When the wolves
disappeared, the numbers of elk increased, and their behavior
changed _ they no longer avoided areas, like aspen groves, where
they were vulnerable to wolf attack. So this might be one reason
the trees suffered.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers are testing this theory. Of course, wolves were
reintroduced to the park in 1995. But it is too early to say
whether their reintroduction will help the aspens.
</P>
<P>
   LONG-LINGERING POLLUTION
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to pollution, the hip bone's connected to the
thigh bone as well, and it can stay connected for a long time.
Pollution from one source can wind up elsewhere, and linger.
</P>
<P>
   Take leaded gasoline, which is long departed from American gas
stations but still doing its dirty work, according to researchers
from the University of California at Santa Cruz who have studied
lead pollution in San Francisco Bay and its tributaries, the San
Joaquin and Sacramento Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers determined that lead spewed from cars three or
four decades ago is still washing out of the Central Valley of
California into the rivers, and then into southern parts of the
bay. They reported on their work in The Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers calculate that it will be another 50 to 100
years before all the lead is washed out. Because as estuaries go,
San Francisco Bay does not flush very well, the lead is likely to
remain in sediments in the bay indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no indication that this lead is hurting humans or
animals, the study offers fresh evidence that pollution is like an
unwanted house guest _ it just won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   PLUTO MISSION SETBACK
</P>
<P>
   NASA has stopped work on a planned mission to Pluto, and
planetary scientists are worried that this will delay any chance to
visit the planet for years.
</P>
<P>
   NASA issued a stop-work order to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
this month, citing rising development costs for the mission, called
the Pluto-Kuiper Express, and two others to far reaches of the
solar system (although work continues on these).
</P>
<P>
   But a committee of the division of planetary sciences of the
American Astronomical Society noted that if work was not resumed
before the end of the year, any chance to launch the mission in
2004 would be lost. The next launching window would not be until
about 2011, with an arrival date of 2019 or later.
</P>
<P>
   Don Savage, a spokesman, said NASA acted because of
``significant cost growth'' of most missions over the past few
months. ``The best thing was to go with the highest priority
science missions first,'' he said, and to redesign the Pluto
project to reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
   Pluto is the only planet in the solar system yet to be visited.
After encountering the planet, the spacecraft would probably go on
to one or more icy asteroidlike bodies in the Kuiper Disk, a cloud
of small objects believed to be left over from the formation of the
solar system.

<TEXT>
<P>
   David McReynolds is on his cellphone, calling from Los Angeles
International Airport, having just arrived on a flight from New
York to make an appearance on the late-night ``Politically
Incorrect With Bill Maher.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't know McReynolds? He's a candidate for president, a
very busy guy who has traveled to 28 states in 10 months to spread
the message of the Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
   He's an ``also-ran,'' one of those guys who pursues the American
presidency with no hope of winning.
</P>
<P>
   He's one of those folks who carves visions out of everyday
dreams, then tries to pitch that picture to America at large,
leaving us to decide if he's a hero or a fool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I don't expect to win,'' says McReynolds, his
cellphone signal fading in and out from the confines of the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a chance to get our message out,'' says the
70-year-old, who lives on Social Security and is campaigning under
the almost invisible Socialist Party budget of $25,000. At the
other end of the phone, the listener realizes that she has not
heard the Socialist Party message this year and may not, unless she
stays up late to watch ``Politically Incorrect.'' Twenty-five grand
doesn't spread much word these days.
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds is joined in his presidential bid by his fellow
dreamers and lifetime devotees to political causes: a liberal
consumer advocate, a conservative pundit and speechwriter, a
retired investment analyst who wants to abolish the federal income
tax, a disabled truck driver and a public policy analyst.
</P>
<P>
   On this year's presidential ballot in Texas, expect to see the
names of not just George W. Bush and Al Gore, but also the Green
Party's Ralph Nader, the Libertarians' Harry Browne, and Pat
Buchanan, who is campaigning as a Reform Party candidate but filed
in Texas as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds' name will appear on the ballot in a handful of
states, but not in Texas. For a minority party to be placed on the
Texas ballot for the first time, it must submit petitions with
nearly 40,000 signatures of folks who did not vote in a state
primary. Too much hassle, McReynolds says. He's going to be a
write-in candidate in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Potential write-ins must declare themselves to the Texas
secretary of state's office before votes for them can count here.
Only two candidates besides McReynolds have declared themselves as
write-ins: James W. Wright (no, not the former speaker of the
House; this is another guy), an independent who lives just
northeast of Houston; and Howard Phillips of the Constitution
Party.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush and Gore casting such large shadows, McReynolds isn't
the only minority party candidate who's been difficult to follow.
Hold on now, this description of the ``also-rans'' is a little bit
like calling play-by-play at a game of musical chairs (but it's
quirky, it really is):
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan started out as a Republican, then left to go to the
Reform Party, where he was not wholly welcome, so he formed a
splinter branch. All over the nation, he calls himself a Reform
Party candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But the Reform Party didn't apply to be on the Texas ballot.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Buchanan filed as an independent to ensure a spot on
the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all.
</P>
<P>
   The Natural Law Party did apply to be on the Texas ballot but
was unable to produce enough verifiable signatures on its
petitions. Plus, it isn't clear which candidate the party would
have produced. Natural Law's favorite son originally was John
Hagelin, the quantum physicist who leads an Iowa think tank on
public policy and practices Transcendental Meditation. (He's
proposing that the U.S. military forces all train in meditation
techniques to alleviate stress and encourage peacekeeping.) The new
branch of the Reform Party likes Hagelin also. It named Hagelin its
presidential candidate, which means he won't be on the ballot in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Whew! This gets so complicated, we figured you could use this
chart on the other guys who are on the ballot in Texas or can be
written in, besides Bush and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And, in case you were wondering, McReynolds made the gig on
``Politically Incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's sincere about his platform, but his platform is
wacky,'' Maher tells the audience. A 30-hour workweek. A $12
minimum wage. Six weeks of paid vacation. Free day care. Free legal
aid. A tax rate of almost 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The other guests give McReynolds a hard time.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me this is everybody hold hands and jump off the bridge
together,'' says actress Kari Wuhrer.
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds gets a word in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obscene that the average CEO earns 400 times more than
the average worker,'' he tells Maher.
</P>
<P>
   He presses on, getting his message out.

   Why his campaign says you should vote for Nader: ``In a time
when the phrase `shallow politics' has become a redundancy, Nader's
reform agenda of civic democracy is not a political position _ it's
his life. For 35 years, he has sustained one of the most effective
citizen's movements in our history,'' _ Jim Hightower, liberal
Texas radio show host and former state agriculture commissioner,
quoted on the Nader Web site.

the independence of my country, and the sovereignty of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan quotable style: ``Let me say to the money boys and the
Beltway elites who think that, at long last, they have pulled up
their drawbridge and locked us out forever: You don't know this
peasant army. We have not yet begun to fight.''_ from his failed

would shrink the federal government, abolish the federal income
tax, encourage privatization and volunteerism, legalize drug use so
prisons don't fill up with nonviolent offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Why he says you should vote for him: ``I am running for
president because the federal government has stuck its nose into
virtually every area of your life, with no constitutional
authority. It has made a mess of our health-care system, of
education, of welfare, and of law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   His quotable style: ``Whatever it is you want, that's what you

 &HT;    U.S. drawn into drug scandal
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - The American Olympic effort in Sydney got splattered
with scandal and suspicion Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The casualties of the scandal were everywhere:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Marion Jones' golden glow now is caught under the dark cloud
that comes from guilt by association.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The United States Olympic Committee is seen, at best, as a
bunch of pretentious double-talkers and _ if you listen to Prince
Alexandre de Merode, the International Olympic Committee Medical
Commission chairman _ the USOC could be the run-and-jump equivalent
of the Watergate conspirators.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Many American athletes were left feeling betrayed by one of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm angry,'' said veteran hurdler Kim Batten. ``If it's true,
it's another case of an athlete stealing from other athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   The culprit here _ according to the International Amateur
Athletic Federation, the governing body worldwide of track and
field _ is C.J. Hunter, Jones' husband and an Olympic qualifier
himself. In a statement released Monday, the IAAF confirmed that
Hunter had tested positive for a banned substance within the IAAF
Doping Control System.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Telegraph of Sydney _ citing a source within the IOC _
reported Monday that Hunter tested positive for the steroids
nandrolone and testosterone at the Bislett Games in Oslo on July
28.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper alleged that Hunter had a reading of nandrolone
1,000 times the legal limit. His testosterone recording also was
said to be way out of whack. In a brief statement, Hunter told
NBC-TV, ``I know what's going on and I know of the allegations and
I'm going to defend myself vigorously.'' Other than that, he
avoided the press.
</P>
<P>
   The guy who serves as his wife's surly, 330-pound bodyguard,
coach and guru had won his own trip to these Olympic Games after
finishing second in the shotput at the U.S. Olympic Trials.
According to Craig Masback, the CEO of USA Track and Field, Hunter
had passed a drug test at the Trials.
</P>
<P>
   Five days after that competition ended, he failed the drug test
in Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter continued to compete in Europe then, unbeknownst to U.S.
track and field coaches, he had arthroscopic surgery on Sept. 3 _
just 12 days before the Games were to begin. He said he had torn
the lateral meniscus in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us about the surgery after the fact,'' said John
Chaplain, head coach of the U.S. men's track and field team.
``There's not much we could do about it then. Because it was a
scope, sometimes someone can come back from that. He told us he
felt he could not get back in time for the Games.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Jones talked publicly about how she was saddened
that her husband's dream had been dashed. The USOC _ citing
confidentiality rules until the case ran its course of second
testing, appeal and abjuration _ said nothing.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night _ as his wife began her monumental task of
trying to win an unprecedented five gold medals at these Games, a
highly-publicized effort that has made Jones the most recognizable
U.S. athlete in Sydney _ Hunter trotted around in the area
restricted for athletes who are competing.
</P>
<P>
   He had been given better credentials than Masback, who claimed
he had little more access than the average fan. That's why, he
said, he did not meet the press after Arne Kjungqvist, the chief
anti-doping officer of the IAAF, accused the American federation of
withholding information on ``12 to 15 positive drug samples over
the past two years.''
</P>
<P>
   No names were mentioned then.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jones later would talk about her husband, he wasn't
there to embrace her after she won. Instead, Jones sought out her
mother and brother, cousins, even strangers in the crowd. Hunter
was in the bowels of Olympic Stadium and, for once, he seemed to
want someone to talk to. Three times he returned to chat it up with
a couple of writers about the pressure of the night and the week
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know if it's going to get easier now or a lot
harder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The answer was right there beneath the surface, but rather than
poke around at it, the USOC _ most notably swim coach Richard Quick
_ rode the high horse and talked about how good the U.S. is at drug
testing and how other countries likely were sending dirty athletes
to these Games.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there were a lot of people at whom you could point a
finger. Before the Games, 27 Chinese swimmers were axed from their
team because of fears they would not pass drug tests in Sydney.
Taiwan, Canada, Norway, Kenya, Bulgaria, Belarus, Romania, Germany,
Iran, Kazakhstan and the Czech Republic all dumped athletes who
tested positive, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Here at the Games, Bulgarian weightlifters were stripped of
medals after positive drug tests. Two Romanian weightlifters, a
Latvian rower and boxers from Iran and Egypt also have been banned
from further competition after positive tests.

 &HT;    Costas turns red? It's just the lighting
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - Bob Costas, NBC's prime-time host, has sandy brown
hair, so why was it looking red, with lovely auburn highlights? He
hasn't been dipping into the henna _ or so he says _ but he heard
the murmurs. Even Hannah Storm, the daytime host, asked why Costas
was becoming a redhead. Within NBC's compound here, no one saw
Costas' hair reddening. But technicians examined how Costas looked
to viewers in his hometown of St. Louis and in New York, and
concluded that it was a combination of lighting on his set and
color enhancements used to transmit the prime-time telecast.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hottest venues at Olympic Park has been the
Superstore, with more than 45,000 shoppers a day. People begin
lining up to get in as early as 7:30 a.m.; the doors open at 8:30
a.m. The store has just about every kind of Olympic souvenir
imaginable, from pins and T-shirts to socks and underwear. The top
seller is the three-pack of mascots in a vinyl tote case; the big
store is unloading about 60,000 of those a day. The Australia-flag
fake tattoo that's seeing on everybody's cheeks has sold out. More
than 700 items are being offered for sale via the Internet at
shop.olympic.com.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the streets, the big item for tourists has been
didgerdoos, the aboriginal horns made of wood. ``Cathy (Freeman)
lighting the torch and the indigenous flavor of the rest of the
Opening Ceremony has aroused heaps of interest,'' said one shop
owner.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about torch songs. Thanks to the Olympics, Madonna is
looking a little less like a Material Girl these days. The official
album of the Opening Ceremony _ featuring songs by Olivia
Newton-John, Tina Arena and other Aussie stars _ has topped
Madonna's album ``Music'' on Australia's pop chart. The Olympic
record has sold over 100,000 copies and Sony/BMG is expecting it to
go platinum (140,000) by the end of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors from the U.S. and the Netherlands have complained to
Australian newspapers that railroad staff give out only Australian
medal tallies and lead only Aussie cheers as thousands of people
queue up for the trains. Railroad officials have promised to spread
the word.
</P>
<P>
   Sharks and crocodiles are big news in Australia. ``Great white
kills honeymoon surfer,'' shouts a headline on page 3 of the Daily
Telegraph. The day before, it was ``Boy, 12, fights off croc.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's Closing Ceremonies are expected to be a big celebration
for the athletes, with a major party and jam session taking place
on the field of Olympic Stadium. Among the Australian stars
expected to come out that night are singer-dancer Christine Anu,
rock star Jimmy Barnes, country legend Slim Dusty, opera singer
Yvonne Kenny and supermodel Elle Macpherson. But the night will
belong to 13-year-old Nikki Webster. The high-flying girl became an
overnight star at the Sept. 15 Opening Ceremony. But by all
accounts she's just an ordinary kid who goes to school at McDonald
College in the Sydney suburb of North Stratfield. According to one
local newspaper: ``Her little dog, Star, got to wag his tail
madly'' when she got home from the Olympic spectacle the other
night. Awww.

 &HT;    Freeman carries weight of Australia to 400-meter gold medal
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - Ten days ago, Cathy Freeman lit the cauldron that
symbolized the start of the 2000 Games. Monday night, Freeman
ignited an Australian celebration for all time _ and hopefully, she
said, helped to unify a nation.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty heady stuff for a 400-meter runner, but Freeman hardly
ranks as ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   With the weight of a continent of 19 million people _ including
300,000 of her indigenous aboriginal descent _ hers alone to bear,
Freeman was undaunted. In 49.11 seconds, she eclipsed the breezy
conditions and the mounting pressure of a nation to win the gold
medal.
</P>
<P>
   Donning a full-length body suit that gave her the look of a
downhill skiier, Freeman rode the emotions of the event with
stunning aplomb. A silver medal would have gained appreciative
applause, but it would have broken the spirits of the country.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Freeman delivered the kind of performance that
will forever mark her career. And when it was over, after sitting
on the ground several moments to compose herself, she draped
herself in the Australian and aboriginal flags and took a victory
lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm reminded constantly of my aboriginal heritage,'' Freeman
said. ``It made me really happy to see my family so happy. . . . It
was a relief. I was totally overwhelmed. I could feel the crowd all
over me.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her wearing two flags ``hopefully will turn some
people's attitudes. . . . people in politics. . . . I made a lot of
people happy from different backgrounds. And I'm happy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the backdrop of the evening was the absence of France's
Marie-Jose Perec, the Atlanta Olympic champion who bolted the Games
amid scandal. Freeman, however, was resolute in her ambition and
focus, which was important because a glance one of the morning
papers signified her importance of her race.
</P>
<P>
   One, the Sydney Morning Herald, screamed on its front-page
headline Monday: ``The race of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided months ago that I would put in a big effort to
relax,'' she said. ``I wasn't going to believe the sensationlism
you guys can create. I was going to make my life simple. To ease
the pressure, I was going to take in every experience, so I can
tell my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Her admitted nervousness was hardly detectable in her pre-race
decorum. Her concentration was unshakable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out fairly relaxed in the first 200 meters and used my
strength I was able to conjure up in the second half,'' she said.

 &HT;    Streak ends as U.S. shut out of gymnastic medals
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - A wobble here, a stumble there and the United States
was shut out of the Olympic gymnastics medals for the first time
since 1972 _ not counting the 1980 boycott year _ as the two team
leaders failed to place in individual events Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Blaine Wilson, who had entered the vault competition with the
highest qualifying score, was sixth, while Elise Ray was eighth on
balance beam.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after the Magnificent Seven won team gold and the
U.S. pulled in four individual medals, the 2000 team went flat.

   ``The door doesn't open very far,'' said Wilson, ``and if you
don't have two good vaults to get in, you're not going to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have two good vaults.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's first vault had a start value of 10.0, but he opened up
a little early and stumbled backwards on his landing. His second
vault was worth only 9.60, the lowest among the eight competitors,
and his 9.30 score wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson had been expected to contend for an individual all-around
medal _ he wound up sixth _ as well as lead the men's team onto the
podium. The men were fifth while the women had to be content with
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson summed up his Olympics as ``an experience. That's it. Not
good, not bad. I was here. . . . I'm tired of explaining the fact
that winning a medal doesn't make you a person. That's all there is
to it. I mean, I'm a two-time Olympian.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray was competing in her first Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we have to have medals around our necks in order
to have pride,'' she said, admitting that nerves contributed to a
major bobble.
</P>
<P>
   Alexei Nemov of Russia won his sixth medal of the Sydney Games,
a gold on high bar to go along with his bronze on parallel bars.
``Sexy Alexei'' also won six medals in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to the Olympic Games hoping that I should try to win at
least one medal, any medal,'' said Nemov, who has a newborn son he
hasn't seen yet. ``I didn't not expect to perform so well.
Everything went my way.''

DEBATE OVER MILK: TIME TO LOOK AT FACTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Got milk?'' cries the National Dairy Council, seeking to
reverse or at least stem a half-century decline in per capita
consumption of this nutrient-packed beverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got beer?'' countered the Physicians Committee for Responsible
Medicine, a nonprofit organization that promotes milk-free
vegetarian diets and in 1992 denounced the feeding of cows' milk to
children.
</P>
<P>
   Although the committee dropped its counterattack when the United
States Department of Agriculture decided to add soy milk as a
``dairy'' option in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the milk
wars continue to rage. Hardly a month passes without another
accusation hurdled at milk as less than an ideal food. Among recent
claims: Milk can cause juvenile diabetes, heart disease, cancer,
digestive disorders, ear infections, mucus in the throat and, in
infants, allergies, colic and iron deficiency anemia. The
Physicians Committee has even accused calcium-rich milk of
increasing, rather than decreasing, the risk of osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   The popular claim that ``cows' milk is for calves,'' not people,
begs an intriguing dietary question: On what grounds can it be said
that any cultivated food _ be it wheat, rice, potatoes, broccoli,
carrots, chicken or pork _ was meant to be eaten by people? Humans
began as hunter-gatherers, eating whatever they could find that
grew naturally. No edible specifically evolved to feed people.
Rather, people learned to cultivate edible plant and animal foods
to assure a more constant food supply.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what has been said and what is actually known about
milk's relationship to health.
</P>
<P>
   HEART DISEASE _ If milk (and other dairy products) are consumed
in large amounts in their whole-fat state, then they may raise
blood levels of cholesterol and contribute to heart disease. But
supermarkets are now bursting with low-fat and nonfat dairy
options, including liquid milk, yogurt, ice cream, cheese and
fat-free ``half-and-half.'' After the age of 2, there is no reason
not to switch to these heart-saving low-fat alternatives,
especially since certain substances in milk may help to lower
cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   CANCER _ A few studies have suggested a link _ but others have
found no link _ between the sugars in milk and ovarian cancer. But
the most carefully done study to date found that women who
developed ovarian cancer actually drank less milk than those who
remained free of this cancer. While the high-fat content of whole
milk and other full-fat dairy products may promote certain cancers,
recent studies have indicated that components of low-fat and
fat-free dairy products can reduce the risk of cancers of the
breast, lungs and colon.
</P>
<P>
   DIABETES _ Type 1 diabetes, as juvenile or insulin-dependent
diabetes is now called, is an autoimmune disease, and there is some
evidence that people who develop it tend to have high levels of
antibodies in their blood to the proteins in cows' milk. The risk,
if there is a real one, of developing this form of diabetes seems
to be related to the consumption of unmodified cows' milk in
infancy by susceptible people.
</P>
<P>
   Infant formulas are heat-treated in a way that modifies these
proteins to reduce the risk that babies will develop antibodies to
them. Also contributing to a lower risk associated with infant
formula is the fact that the amount of protein in formula more
closely resembles that of breast milk, which has less than half the
protein in cows' milk.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants in
their first year not be given unmodified cows' milk or products
like ice cream or yogurt made from unmodified cows' milk. Waiting
to introduce cows' milk until an infant's digestive system is more
fully matured will reduce the risk of milk allergy and possibly
other allergies as well. Incidentally, allergic reactions to milk,
which most often develop in infancy, are nearly always outgrown by
the elementary grades.
</P>
<P>
   MUCUS IN THE THROAT _ Whole milk, because of its consistency,
can coat the mouth and throat temporarily and create the sensation
of thickened saliva or mucus. But a blind study in Australia that
included people who believed the milk-mucus relationship found no
difference in reports of mucus in the throat among those who ate
chocolate-disguised cows' milk or soy milk. While professional
singers, actors or public speakers may refrain from milk shortly
before performances, there is no reason for them to do so at other
times or for others to avoid milk for this reason. If milk-induced
mucus seems to bother you, try switching to nonfat milk.
</P>
<P>
   OSTEOPOROSIS _ It is true that in most Asian countries, where
little or no dairy products are consumed, there is a much lower
incidence of osteoporosis than in the United States. But it is also
true that Asians eat a lot more calcium-rich vegetables and a lot
less protein than Americans do. The excess protein consumed by most
Americans actually removes calcium from the body. Asians also get a
lot more physical exercise and consume less cola, which can impede
the use of calcium.
</P>
<P>
   Milk and other dairy products are by far the leading sources of
bone-building nutrients _ primarily calcium and vitamin D _ in the
American diet. Although milk contains protein, the ratio of calcium
to protein in milk is high enough to favor bone development, not
the bone loss suggested by the Physicians Committee.
</P>
<P>
   DIGESTIVE PROBLEMS _ About one-quarter of Americans develop
varying degrees of lactose intolerance, an inability to digest the
natural sugar in milk, which can result in bloating, flatulence and
sometimes diarrhea. The incidence of lactose intolerance is highest
in American Indians, African-Americans and people of Eastern
European or Asian descent.
</P>
<P>
   But most people with lactose intolerance can drink a glass of
milk with meals with few if any symptoms. Also, yogurt with live
active cultures (the bacteria produce lactose-digesting enzymes)
and hard cheeses (which lose most of the lactose when the curds are
formed) are unlikely to cause symptoms. In addition,
lactose-reduced dairy products _ milk, cottage cheese, even ice
cream _ are now widely available. Or, you can prepare your own
lactose-reduced milk by adding the enzyme lactase (sold as Lactaid
drops in pharmacies) to liquid milk and waiting a day to consume
it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to building bones, the calcium and other components
in milk may help prevent hypertension (and, thus, heart disease and
stroke) and cancers of the breast and colon. Milk is also a good
source of other vital nutrients, including vitamins A and D,
riboflavin, protein, phosphorus and the trace elements copper, zinc
and manganese.
</P>
<P>
   A large national study called DASH has shown that only when a
low-fat diet rich in fruits and vegetables is combined with three
servings a day of low-fat dairy foods is the diet effective in
lowering blood pressure and reducing blood levels of homocysteine,
another risk factor for heart disease.

 &HT;    Back on track: U.S. edges Australia, will play for gold
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker

<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKTOWN, Australia - About the only thing not working in the
U.S. dugout on Monday was coach Ralph Raymond's earplug.
</P>
<P>
   The battery went dead sometime during his team's 1-0 victory
over Australia, and he couldn't hear most of the on-field chatter
in the late innings as the two American softball icons were working
through some of their own personal torment.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Dot Richardson, who committed two errors in a
round-robin loss to Japan last week, was shouting encouragement to
Lisa Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, tagged with a 13th inning game-winning home run by
Australia's Peta Edebone on Thursday, was admittedly nervous after
Richardson drove in the only run of the game in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   But Fernandez relaxed, and in getting Edebone to ground out and
happily fielding Joanne Brown's tapper in front of the plate for
the last out of the game, she exacted a measure of revenge on the
two Aussies who have beaten her in successive Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the United States will get a chance to complete a
trifecta of sorts by meeting undefeated Japan in its bid to retain
the gold medal. For the second straight Olympics, Australia earns
the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's destiny, but we get to play the three teams that
beat us,'' said pitcher and designated hitter Michele Smith. ``What
we showed today is that USA softball will not lay down and die.''

 &HT;    Johnson, Freeman leave rest behind in 400 final
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - Under an Australian sky absent of stars, Michael
Johnson shot around the Olympic Stadium track like a supernova
Monday night, confirming his place in history as the only man to
win back-to-back gold medals in the 400 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras flashed during the 43.85 seconds it took Johnson to
round the red track that was slightly damp with rain. Not even a
less-than-perfect surface prevented him from Olympic glory.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did it stop Cathy Freeman, the Australian of aborigine
descent who overcame the immense pressure and expectations of an
entire nation. Performing in a full-length green and yellow body
suit, Freeman blistered the field in 49.11, powering to the gold
medal in the final stretch of the race.
</P>
<P>
   It was a conquest that caused a crescendo of emotions for
Australians and Freeman, who fell to one knee, took a seat on the
ground and fought back tears after she broke the tape at the
finish. She smoked a field that was devoid of the '96 Olympic
champion, Marie-Jose Perec of France, who pulled out of the Games
last week amid scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman was unfazed by any outside influence. But her elation
and release of pressure poured over after the trek, when she draped
herself in two flags _ one Australia, one aborigine _ and took a
prolonged lap around the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a fairly creative imagination and I can't think of
(anything better),'' Freeman said. ``I was really nervous, but
there was a voice that kept telling me, `Do what you know. Do what
you know.' . . . If there was anything I was pleased with, it was
how I weathered the pressure.``
</P>
<P>
   With all Australia virtually demanding a win, Freeman was
``totally overwhelmed,'' she said. ``I could feel the crowd all
over me. I could feel the happiness, the joy in every pore of my
body.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson poured on the speed and power in the final half of the
race. And when his historic feat was accomplished, he, too, showed
a sense of relief. He became the first in 23 400-meter Olympic
finals to repeat as champion. And he did so in his trademark
upright style, churning up distance with apparent ease. Wearing his
gold spikes laced with 24-carat gold, Johnson bolted out of the
blocks as if jettisoned by hydraulics.
</P>
<P>
   He made the turn to the final straightaway with a burst of
momentum, which made the final 75 meters or so seem like an
afternoon jog.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, he exchanged hugs with members of his heat,
including silver medalist Alvin Harrison of the United States. Like
Freeman, Johnson took an American flag and took a lap.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who turned 33 last week, said this was his last
Olympics. If so, he departed in classic and memorable fashion.
</P>
<P>
   He holds the world record in the 400, 43.18, set in Seville on
Aug. 26, 1999 and the Olympic milestone of 43.49 set in Atlanta in
'96. And while there was speculation that he would go for an
all-time low Monday, he was satisfied simply crushing the field.
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic battle, the United States' Stacy Dragila beat out
Australia's Tatiana Grigorieva for the gold medal in the pole
vault. Dragila, a left-hander, won it by clearing 15.1 feet (4.60
meters), an Olympic record.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's Anier Garcia won the gold in the 110-meter hurdles and
America's Terrence Trammela and Mark Crear took the silver and
bronze, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the evening, Gail Devers, the 100-meter hurdler
champion, won two heats with ease Monday to advance to the
semifinals on Wednesday. Sharon Couch also made the semis in that
event, as did fellow American Melissa Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   James Carter of the U.S. won his heat in the 400-meter hurdles
semifinals; Angelo Taylor also advanced.

GEBRSELASSIE WINS GOLD AGAIN IN THE 10,000, NIPPING TERGAT BY
.009 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ He had finished second to Haile Gebrselassie
in the last Summer Olympics, and finished second again at both the
1997 world championships and the 1999 world championships. But this
major race felt different to Paul Tergat as he sprinted into the
lead with the finish line in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Hadn't Gebrselassie, the diminutive Ethiopian with the wicked
finishing kick, been moving more slowly of late? Hadn't his leg
been bothering him all year? Hadn't all the victories and the miles
on hard tracks built for sprinters left Tergat's rival slightly
less hungry, less fresh?
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't this finally be his moment, his 10,000 meters, his gold
medal?
</P>
<P>
   Tergat pushed on: His long, thin legs and arms working
confidently. But what the Kenyan could not see as he broke free of
the Ethiopian was how quickly Gebrselassie responded to the
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised when Tergat started sprinting before I did,''
Gebrselassie said. ``But I knew I could do something in the last
few hundred meters.''
</P>
<P>
   Off the two African rivals went, through the final turn with
Gebrselassie slowly making up ground. Down the final straightaway
with both men's teeth flashing through the pain. Down to the final
10 meters, and then the Ethiopian lunged past the Kenyan at the
tape in a finish that bore a much greater resemblance to the
split-second denouement of a 100-meter race than the end of a
10,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
   The closest race in Olympic history in this event was over, and
Tergat was still only the second best long-distance track runner of
his generation. Gebrselassie had won his second Olympic gold medal
in a time of 27 minutes 18.20 seconds. Tergat had won his second
silver in 27:18.29. (One has to look back to 1932 to find a closer
finish in an Olympic distance race; in the 5,000 meters that year,
Lauri Lehtinen of Finland and Ralph Hill of the United States
finished in a virtual dead heat.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I never competed in a race with a finish like this, except
maybe in a distance like 1,500,'' Gebrselassie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never sure I had it won,'' said Tergat, surprisingly
upbeat. ``But I thought I might have it this time. Unfortunately I
was supposed to start sprinting with 300 to go, but I could not
pass. I was trying to find a way to get past earlier, but I did my
best. I can do no better than that. I had nothing left at the
end.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of the things driving Gebrselassie down the stretch was the
understanding that his fellow Ethiopians might not be able to deal
with his defeat. ``I think if you came back to Ethiopia and it was
a silver or bronze for Haile, I don't think the people would accept
it,'' he said. ``I survived today.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a year for survival for the 27-year-old who has
broken or re-broken 15 world records in his career and not lost at
10,000 meters since 1993 or at 5,000 since 1996. Before Christmas,
Gebrselassie began feeling pain in an Achilles tendon; enough pain
to keep him from training and make him think this Olympic season
might be compromised.
</P>
<P>
   The pain lingered, and he was still considering whether he could
run the 10,000 here shortly before the Olympics began. New shoes
and constant treatment made it possible.
</P>
<P>
   As befits a historic occasion, Gebrselassie and Tergat almost
certainly will never race in a 10,000 meters like this again. The
Kenyan is planning to convert to the half-marathon and marathon,
and Gebrselassie is expected to make the same transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we will meet again,'' Tergat said.
</P>
<P>

&HT;     DEMOCRATS TRY TO MAKE BORDER POVERTY A CAMPAIGN ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ When Texas Gov. George W. Bush talks about the
border, he focuses on increasing trade between the United States
and Mexico, and the benefits for residents on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   He talks of his close ties with Mexican officials and his
success in wooing Hispanic voters in his two campaigns for
governor.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, has spent
little time talking about the widespread poverty along the border,
even as his opponents have tried to make it a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee produced a video about the
``colonias,'' the Spanish name given to border shantytowns, where
new immigrants live in substandard housing, often without
electricity, running water or adequate sewerage systems.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the border at Laredo cuts to the heart of Bush's
presidential campaign speeches about economic opportunity. Here,
the 18-wheelers hum across the new $128 million Laredo IV World
Trade Bridge, but the residents of the colonias struggle to pay for
water hookups.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has won praise for his aggressive effort to increase trade
with Mexico, turning the border city of Laredo into a major
commercial hub.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's critics argue that as governor he failed to create or
encourage programs to address the abject poverty that afflicts the
border. A 1998 report by Texas Comptroller John Sharp, a Democrat,
found that if the 43 counties bordering Mexico were pulled together
into the nation's 51st state, it would have the highest poverty
rate, highest percentage of schoolchildren in poverty, highest
unemployment rate and highest percentage of adults without a high
school education in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's supporters say he has done more than past Democratic
governors by helping to get long-neglected colonia residents hooked
up to water and sewer service.
</P>
<P>
   And they also say that border poverty is a national problem _
one neglected by the Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of things that are unfair in campaigns, but
that's a pretty low blow,'' said Texas Secretary of State Elton
Bomer, the governor's liaison on colonia issues. ``He should be
applauded for being willing to do something to address the (water)
hookups and actually getting people hooked up and paying their
bills. We're not going to attack (Vice President Al) Gore or blame
him for the problems of Appalachia in Tennessee.''
</P>
<P>
   Adelaida de la Rosa, who raises her five children in the
impoverished community of El Cenizo, would like more help buying
food and getting medical care for her children, but she does not
expect a handout from the state of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In America, she said, her children still are better off than in
Mexico, although the family lives on only $97 a month from Social
Security and $200 a month in food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they know English as much as Spanish. They can read and
write. They have good schooling here,'' de la Rosa said. ``They
didn't have anything before.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas border, which stretches 1,200 miles between El Paso
and Brownsville, is almost its own state _ culturally and
economically, it's as similar to Mexico City as it is to Dallas or
Houston. In Laredo, where 94 percent of residents are Hispanic,
fluency in English is helpful, but knowledge of Spanish is
essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep telling politicians in Washington that it isn't where
the United States ends and Mexico begins,'' said Laredo Mayor Betty
Flores. ``It's where the United States blends into Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Laredo is undergoing a municipal growth spurt second only to
that of Las Vegas. The city of nearly 200,000 has built a
technologically advanced hospital and expanded its airport.
Hundreds of warehouses have been built to store goods from the
factories on the Mexican side of the border. The products are
destined for the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   The boom began in the mid-1980s when Mexico joined the
international trade alliance and drastically cut duties on U.S.
exports. It gained steam the North American Free Trade Agreement
took effect in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Bush visited Laredo in April, crossing the border to join
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo and cut the ribbon on the new
eight-lane, trucks-only bridge, the fourth bridge connecting Laredo
to Mexico. In his speech, Bush said he would push for an ``entire
hemisphere of free trade'' if elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past there have been walls and divides between Mexico
and the United States,'' Bush said. ``Today one more barrier has
fallen away, one more divide has been bridged.''
</P>
<P>
   Trade has expanded during Bush's tenure as governor, primarily
because of the forces of globalization and NAFTA. Texas has clearly
benefited: Half of U.S. exports to Mexico pass through Texas. Some
Laredo officials say Bush's business-friendly policies helped them
lure more businesses to the area.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the boom in cross-border trade, Laredo remains a poor
city. Per capita income in Webb County is $12,999 a year, about
half the national average. In Laredo, 45 percent of children live
in poverty, compared with 19 percent nationwide.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Webb County has about 50 colonias. Colonias began to spread in
the 1950s on rural land that was unusable for agriculture, often
because it was on a floodplain. Developers sold tiny lots with no
water, electric or sewer service to poor people, who built their
own, often substandard homes.
</P>
<P>
   According to the governor's office, Texas has about 1,500
colonias with about 400,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   In his first run for governor, Bush used the colonias as a
campaign issue against Democratic Gov. Ann Richards, whom he
unseated in 1994. ``There's a big difference between rhetoric and
delivering,'' he told the San Antonio Express-News, ``and the fact
that there is still a problem speaks volumes.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush's record in dealing with colonias is uneven, his
critics acknowledge the Republican governor has made some progress.
</P>
<P>
   In his first year in office, he signed a bill barring developers
from selling lots without water, sewer and other services. Last
year, he approved $5.6 million in state housing department funds to
help poor residents build or fix their homes, and he signed a bill
to give border counties more planning authority to block
construction of colonias.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, he put Bomer in charge of improving conditions in the
colonias. Bomer is praised for pulling together $25 million in
grants from the federal government and the North American
Development Bank to help colonia residents pay the $1,200 average
cost for water and sewer connections. They plan to have one quarter
of the estimated 100,000 colonia households hooked up by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say Bush has refused to dip deeply into the state
treasury to pay for the programs, despite a record budget
surpluses. Bush didn't back a constitutional amendment to sell $100
million in bonds for affordable housing, which died in the
Legislature in 1999. The same year, he helped push a $1.7 billion
tax cut through the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Still, few in the colonias complain about Bush and many said
they don't expect special treatment from the state.
</P>
<P>
   In Rio Bravo, a colonia considered upscale because it has rutted
but paved streets, Isabel Santana, 59, a native of Mexico, takes
care of her 61-year-old husband, Andres, who was just released from
the hospital after a heart attack. Their three-room cinder block
house has no indoor plumbing, so she washes clothes and dishes in a
tub in the yard.
</P>
<P>
   Santana, who cleaned houses and raised 10 children in Houston,
said she liked Bush's father and ``so the son has to do good as
well.'' She doesn't blame the Texas governor for the lack of
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing what he can,'' she said. ``But the people who work
under him, if they don't do it, that's something else.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Three years ago, Stacy Dragila bought a
Labrador retriever and nicknamed it Sydney in the hope that her
sport, women's pole vault, would be added to the 2000 Summer
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Her hope was realized, and Monday night Dragila became the first
gold medalist in her event. Dragila nearly exited the competition
early, but regained her composure to clear 15 feet 1 inch in front
of 112,524 people at Olympic stadium, nearly all of them cheering
for her main rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to stay within myself and keep my head on my
shoulders to perform and hopefully jump higher,'' Dragila said.
</P>
<P>
   After missing her first two attempts at 14-9, Dragila cleared
the bar on her third try. She tends to get stronger the more jumps
she takes, and Monday night she outlasted Tatyana Grigoryeva, the
Australian who moved here from Russia in 1997. She won the silver
medal with a vault of 14-11.
</P>
<P>
   The bronze medal went to Vala Flosadottir of Iceland, the first
woman from her country to win an Olympic medal. Dragila attempted
to surpass her own world record of 15-2\, set in July at the U.S.
Olympic trials, but she just nudged the bar off the stanchions on
her third attempt at 15-3.
</P>
<P>
   Later, she turned her back to the crowd and tossed a bouquet of
flowers over her shoulder as if she were at a wedding reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gold medal is beyond any world record,'' said Dragila, who
lives in Pocatello, Idaho. ``To make history, I don't think there's
anything better.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the women's 400-meter race, which featured the
Australian gold medalist Cathy Freeman, the pole vault seemed to
engage the crowd more than any other event Monday night. All three
medalists played to the audience, raising their hands above their
heads to encourage clapping as they hoisted their fiberglass poles
and approached the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was piercing,'' Dragila said of the partisan crowd. ``I was
just crying to get a couple of claps as I went down the runway.''
</P>
<P>
   Dragila, who is 29, could not have expected such a rapt audience
seven years ago, when she took up pole-vaulting at the
recommendation of Dave Nielson, her coach at Idaho State.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 Dragila's first attempt was at six feet, which would not
be considered a challenging high jump today, much less a vault.
</P>
<P>
   ``To take up the pole vault seven years ago and to be here with
a gold medal tonight is unreal,'' Dragila said. ``I just never
imagined this when I first went to the pole-vault pit and tried it
out. I still remember going in the air upside down, thinking to
myself, `What am I doing?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know where I was. There were a lot of days like that
in the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Auburn, Calif., Dragila was a member of the 4-H club
in high school and participated in such sports as goat-tying. She
was also a resourceful athlete who won a college scholarship as a
heptathlete. In junior college, she was discouraged from vaulting
by a male athlete at her school, but she renewed her interest at
Idaho State. Unnerved by the inverted positioning required in the
pole vault, she began working at a gymnastics club to improve her
sense of awareness in the air.
</P>
<P>
   She won the 1999 world championship in Seville, Spain, but women
were given only half the prize money of the men. Monday night,
Dragila won, and the gold medal she received was the same as those
given to the men.

SOMETHING SPECIAL IN THAT GLASS OF WINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since the evidence began to accumulate that moderate wine
consumption can reduce the risk of heart disease, researchers have
sought to discover whether the benefit lay simply in the alcohol
consumed, or whether wine offered additional protection.
</P>
<P>
   According to an article in last week's issue of Annals of
Internal Medicine, there truly is something about wine.
</P>
<P>
   The findings of previous studies had been inconclusive. So
epidemiologists from the Institute of Preventive Medicine in sought
a bigger sample size: They pooled studies that tracked more than
14,000 people for an average of nearly 20 years and compared the
drinking patterns of those who died and those who did not.
</P>
<P>
   Nondrinkers and light drinkers who avoided wine had virtually
the same mortality rate, but the death rate among light drinkers of
wine was about a third less, they found. Heavy drinkers of any kind
died younger than nondrinkers or light drinkers, but the death rate
was lower when heavy drinkers included wine in their intake.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that the gap in death rates applied to
cancer as well as heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers say their findings suggest that wine may contain
one or several substances that add to the beneficial effect of a
small amount of alcohol. But they add that the results may also
reflect some unrecognized personal habits that were not
successfully controlled in the research.
</P>
<P>
   REMEDIES: GARLIC TO CUT CHOLESTEROL? DON'T BOTHER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Garlic consumption can lower cholesterol levels, but not by
enough to constitute an effective treatment, researchers have
found.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, from the University of Essex in England,
analyzed data from 13 studies involving almost 800 people.
</P>
<P>
   They found that garlic on average led to a 4 percent decline in
cholesterol levels, a drop they called ``unimpressive'' compared
with 5 percent reductions from dietary changes alone or 17 percent
from statin drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our results suggest that garlic is superior to placebo in
reducing elevated total cholesterol levels. However, the size of
the effect is modest, and the robustness of the effect is
debatable,'' they wrote in last week's issue of The Annals of
Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In clinical practice, they added, garlic use ``is not an
efficient way to decrease total serum cholesterol level.'' Patients
who want to use garlic for cholesterol treatment, the researchers
said, should be told that the benefits are minimal.
</P>
<P>
   PREVENTION: EXPLORING ANTIBIOTICS FOR GASTRIC DISTRESS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Using antibiotics to wipe out the bacteria that cause ulcers can
cure some cases of chronic gastrointestional distress _ far from
every case, but enough to make the treatment worth trying,
according to an article and editorial in The British Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The bacterium, Helicobacter pylori, is the main cause of ulcers,
and it has been linked to gastric cancers. Some doctors in recent
years have argued for treating gastrointestinal distress, or
dyspepsia, with antibiotics as a way of preventing the onset of the
more serious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Others have countered that there is little evidence that
eradicating the bacteria actually cures dyspepsia.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the General Infirmary at Leeds, England,
analyzed 12 studies involving about 2,500 patients whose dyspepsia
was treated either with a placebo or with antibiotics for H.
pylori.
</P>
<P>
   They found that the patients getting antibiotics did somewhat
better: 36 percent were cured or much improved, compared with 28
percent of placebo patients.
</P>
<P>
   They calculated that 15 patients would have to be treated for
every one cured. But an accompanying editorial noted that the true
benefits of such treatment would be greater, once prevention of
progression to ulcers was considered. It recommended that doctors
test dyspeptic patients for H. pylori and treat those who are found
to be carrying it.
</P>
<P>
   TREATMENT Doctors Try Cooling as Stroke Therapy &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A small experiment in Copenhagen that involved efforts to limit
a stroke's damage by cooling patients down generated enough
evidence of a benefit to warrant larger-scale testing, according to
an article in the September issue of the journal Stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Animal experiments had shown that inducing hypothermia could
reduce the amount of damage to brain tissue during a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from Bispebjerg Hospital treated 17 patients who
were awake but suffering from severe strokes by cooling their
bodies with a steady stream of cold air for six hours, lowering
their body temperatures by an average of 2.3 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Six months after the stroke, only 12 percent of the study group
had died, compared with 23 percent of patients in a comparison
group. A smaller difference was found in neurological functioning
among the survivors: The hypothermia patients ranked about 12
percent higher.
</P>
<P>
   PATTERNS: STRESS AND FAT, LINKED AT THE WAIST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new study suggests that for women, stress and fat are linked _
but at the waist, not the hips.
</P>
<P>
   The study from Yale University found that women who are more
upset by stressful circumstances and have a harder time adjusting
to them are more likely to be fat around the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Most premenopausal women store their fat in a manner doctors
call peripherally, around the hips, rather than centrally, on the
stomach, the way most men do. Abdominal fat in either sex has been
linked to higher risks of heart disease and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   At times of stress, the body releases a hormone called cortisol
that also causes fat to be stored centrally, so the researchers
examined a group of 30 women with abdominal fat who were not
otherwise overweight, and compared their responses to stress with
those of 29 women with extra weight in their hips but not
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the current issue of Psychosomatic Medicine,
the researchers reported that the women with abdominal fat felt
more threatened by stressful tasks, performed worse on them and
consistently secreted more cortisol. They showed less ability to
adjust to the tasks even as they became familiar, meaning that
their cortisol levels remained high on the second and third days of
the experiment. Cortisol fell in the comparison group.
</P>
<P>
   The women with abdominal fat also described themselves as having
``more negative moods and higher levels of life stress,'' said Dr.
Elissa S. Epel, a psychologist, now at the University of California
at San Francisco, who led the Yale study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greater exposure to life stress or psychological vulnerability
to stress may explain their enhanced cortisol reactivity,'' Epel
said. ``In turn, their cortisol exposure may have led them to
accumulate greater abdominal fat.''
</P>
<P>
   Further study is needed to delineate any role genetic traits
play in fat distribution, she said, and to make clear whether the
vulnerability to stress causes the accumulation of abdominal fat or
is merely a parallel phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Cortisol levels can be reduced by getting enough sleep, exercise
and relaxation, she said, adding that this advice holds true for
both sexes.

STUDY TIES SINUSITIS TO FUNGI IN THE NOSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Minn., Pa., Mass., Austria)   (Science Times)  
 By GABRIELLE GLASER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Scientists long thought that sinusitis, the most
common long-term disease in the United States, was caused by
allergies or by bacteria trapped inside the labyrinthine sinuses.
Over the years, doctors have tried a variety of treatments for
chronic coldlike symptoms with limited success.
</P>
<P>
   Then last year, researchers at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minn., reported that they had found another possible cause: an
overly aggressive immune reaction to fungi in the nose. ``It is a
total shift of the paradigm,'' said Dr. Jens Ponikau, one of the
Mayo researchers.
</P>
<P>
   With new laboratory techniques, scientists have compiled a much
clearer picture of the organisms that grow in noses and sinuses,
and the pictures show that fungi are more prevalent than previously
believed. In addition, the researchers came up with a possible
mechanism through which the body's reaction to fungi causes the
inflammation that fosters sinusitis in some people.
</P>
<P>
   The finding, if true, suggests the need for a different
approach, aimed at killing the fungi. The antihistamines that tamp
down an allergic person's response to a nose full of cat dander,
pollen or dust mites appear to have no effect on the stuffiness
caused by the fungi.
</P>
<P>
   At a rhinology conference on Friday in Washington, the
researchers reported that they had tried a new treatment aimed at
the fungi. Dr. David Sherris, who conducted the three-month
experiment, gave 51 patients with chronic sinus inflammation an
antifungal drug spray. Thirty-eight, or 75 percent, reported a
reduction in symptoms, which researchers confirmed by visual
examination.
</P>
<P>
   The research, Sherris said, suggests that the antifungal drugs
may eliminate the need for steroids. Sixteen of the patients who
reported improvement were taking steroids for the disease, and 13
of them were able to reduce their dose or do without the drugs
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The Mayo results have not been subjected to the most rigorous
test, a double-blind clinical study, although one is planned for
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some experts at the conference were skeptical. ``This
isn't a magic wand just yet, but it's a hopeful sign,'' said Dr.
Jordan Josephson, a Manhattan otolaryngologist.
</P>
<P>
   Josephson likened the findings to the discovery some years ago
that bacteria, not diet or stress, caused stomach ulcers. ``People
thought that was crazy, too, but it turned out to be true,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Kennedy, a professor of otolaryngology at the
University of Pennsylvania, also counseled caution. Chronic
sinusitis, he said, is caused by a variety of factors, including
viruses, pollution, stress and genetic disorders that make the
sinuses function improperly.
</P>
<P>
   The Mayo researchers do not disagree. They say their study is
applicable to many cases, not all. ``We're not declaring victory
just yet,'' Sherris said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors had searched tissue samples from surgery for clues to
the disease, but the Mayo team began to examine nasal mucus to see
if it contained anything that was swelling the sinuses. ``The enemy
is in the mucus, not the tissue,'' Ponikau said. ``We weren't
watching the movie till the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponikau described the process this way: When confronted with
fungi, the bodies of chronic sinusitis sufferers dispatch white
blood cells called eosinophils. They leave the bloodstream and
cross into the mucus to destroy the invader. In doing so, they
release a toxic protein that irritates the delicate lining of the
sinuses, making them susceptible to bacterial infections.
</P>
<P>
   Sherris said that while the presence of fungi was nearly
universal, only people who were sensitive to them experienced the
immune reaction. He compared the reaction to a ragweed allergy.
Everyone breathes in the same amount of ragweed pollen, but only
those who are sensitive to it develop symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   New laboratory techniques have helped make the connection
between fungi and sinusitis clearer, the researchers said.
Researchers in Rochester and in Graz, Austria, found dozens of
species of fungi growing in the noses of both patients and healthy
people. Dr. Walter Buzina, a microbiologist in Graz, actually grew
mushrooms from the fungi he found in the subjects' noses. Slides of
his petri dishes showed molds commonly found in bread bags or under
logs.
</P>
<P>
   A 1994 Harvard University study showed that chronic sinusitis,
which afflicts about 40 million Americans, costs the nation about
$2.4 billion a year. The disease is also on the rise: From
1990-1992, federal statistics showed that it was responsible for 73
million lost workdays, up from 50 million in 1986-1988.

   SYDNEY, Australia _ The drug scandal of the Olympics does not
lie in weightlifting.
</P>
<P>
   It does not lie in the soap-operatic story of the Romanian who
threatened to commit suicide after he tested positive for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   It does not lie in the exiles imposed on the Romanian and
Bulgarian teams, who were ordered out of the Games because three of
their lifters had tested positive in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   It does not lie in the absurd $50,000 fine the Romanians and
Bulgarians can pay to circumvent exile and get their allegedly
clean lifters back into the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   No, the scandal isn't in the sordid tales. The scandal is in the
silence.
</P>
<P>
   The silence about human growth hormone. The silence about the
untold designer drugs that we can't even imagine and for which
sports officials can't begin to test.
</P>
<P>
   The silence won't be broken in the Sydney Olympic Park. To find
the truth, a sports fan must go to a bookstore and buy a copy of
``Positive,'' written by Werner Reiterer, an Australian discus
thrower who could have been a contender for gold at these Games.
</P>
<P>
   After attending two Olympics and becoming convinced that he
couldn't win without pharmaceutical aid, Reiterer went on a heavy
diet of drugs five years ago. About six months ago, he retired,
gave up his dream as it sat right in front of him. In his book, he
said he knew he was a cheater, and he couldn't bear winning that
way.
</P>
<P>
   Reiterer also wrote of going into a drug test and bluntly
telling officials: ``You know, I'm full of drugs. I'll name them
for you.'' He proceeded to list eight completely undetectable
substances. The officials admitted they were powerless to punish
him, even with his admission.
</P>
<P>
   Give all credit to the people who run the weightlifting
federation. They knew their sport was the ultimate sham, and they
instituted some of the harshest penalties in international sports,
most notably the ``three strikes and you're out for a year'' policy
aimed at rogue nations.
</P>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee allows the $50,000 fine to
clear things up. The weightlifting federation wishes there were no
loophole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people thought weightlifting was another name for drugs,
and drugs were another name for weightlifting,'' said Tamas Ajan,
general secretary of the International Weightlifting Federation.
``If all sports would do what we are doing, it would make a great
step to clean up the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is that the weightlifters are testing positive for
drugs that are practically prehistoric, nowhere near the cutting
edge. Bulgarian officials, when informed what one lifter had in his
system, defended him by saying that he would never have taken that
particular substance because ``it was much too primitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Over at the swimming pool, the bulky steroidal profile is
considered an outdated starting point for suspicion. The assumption
is that the drugs have become so advanced that size means nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Inge de Bruijn of the Netherlands has been watched warily since
she set 11 world records in four months, and she has a waist
smaller than Ian Thorpe's feet. She is a mere strip of rock-hard
muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Quick, the American women's coach, has called on the
swimming federation to test more aggressively and on the IOC to
invest money in more sophisticated testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I believe this a clean meet?'' he said near the end of the
swimming competition. ``No, I absolutely do not think this is a
drug-free Olympics. I am disappointed in the quality and frequency
of testing that's done by the international governing body of the
Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   With those remarks, Quick dived into a vat of hot water.
Everyone assumed that he was pointing a finger at de Bruijn, who
had beaten two of his swimmers, Jenny Thompson and Dara Torres.
Those people assumed incorrectly. Earlier in the meet, when Quick
talked about Thompson's losses to drug cheats in the past, he went
out of his way to say: ``I want to make it clear that I'm not
talking about Inge.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Australian stories didn't include that quote. The father
of Pieter van den Hoogenband, the other Dutch superstar of the
meet, called Quick an idiot.
</P>
<P>
   But the only idiots at Olympic sports venues are the ones who
don't believe what Quick said.
</P>
<P>
   De Bruijn may be clean. She could be the real thing, even though
she didn't start cutting a swath through the record books until age
26. She was always a good swimmer, if not a spectacular one. To
think that she couldn't improve in her 20s is to discount human
potential entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Quick has spoken out in favor of better drug testing ever since
his 33-year-old comeback star, Torres, faced a raft of rumors and
innuendo at the U.S. Trials. He said he wanted to know why Torres
had not been tested out of competition, the most effective current
method for catching cheaters.
</P>
<P>
   A check of the international swimming federation Web site
confirms Quick's statement. It shows no out-of-competition tests
for Torres. It does show four for de Bruijn this year, the last one
in August.
</P>
<P>
   Quick knows that only better testing, not silence, will protect
the innocent. So he challenged the testers to come after one of his
swimmers. It might have been bravado, but at least Quick wasn't
quiet.

EFFORT TO RESTORE THE EVERGLADES IS TOO IMPORTANT NOT TO ATTEMPT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JACK Z. SMITH 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If ever there were a project that required a master plumber, the
proposed restoration of the Florida Everglades is it.
</P>
<P>
   Plumbers are charged with making water systems work reliably.
That's precisely the challenge in the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   What's proposed is a colossal repair job _ a $7.8 billion
undertaking labeled as the largest environmental restoration
project in history.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is now considering legislation to provide federal
funding for the project in partnership with the state of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The project has two major goals.
</P>
<P>
   One is to resuscitate the Everglades' unique and heavily damaged
ecosystem by attempting to recreate, as nearly as possible, the
original natural water flow that gave it the name ``River of
Grass.''
</P>
<P>
   The second goal is to ensure adequate future water supplies for
the exploding population of South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration plan calls for storing hundreds of billions of
gallons of water along the fringes of the Everglades, both in
surface reservoirs and in hundreds of wells. At appropriate times,
when greater water flow is needed, it would be pumped into the
Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   It's an elaborate and complex endeavor that government
officials, engineers, environmentalists, scientists, water utility
officials, nature lovers, commercial fishermen, sport fishing
enthusiasts and others will be watching with one burning question
in mind:
</P>
<P>
   How well will it work?
</P>
<P>
   Despite the project's enormous cost, there's a widely held
opinion that it is a worthy endeavor. It's got broad support from
several major environmental groups, many members of Congress from
both major parties, and Florida officials including Gov. Jeb Bush,
brother of Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there is spirited debate about whether the
proposed restoration plan is adequate and about the particulars of
how to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: The project has applications far beyond
the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental destruction already wrought to the Everglades,
and the multibillion-dollar effort to rectify that damage, will
provide lessons in Texas and many other parts of the world about
the need to protect valuable wetlands, bays and estuaries _ and the
adverse environmental and economic consequences of not doing so.
</P>
<P>
   The Everglades once encompassed more than 8 million acres of
South Florida. That area has been cut in half by massive drainage
and development, primarily in the past half century. But the
``Glades,'' as they're often referred to in Florida newspapers,
still stretch across more than 100 miles of South Florida.
Everglades National Park constitutes only one-fifth of this
extraordinary ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   National Parks, the magazine of the National Parks Conservation
Association, has called the Everglades' restoration effort ``the
largest environmental restoration project in the history of
humankind.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Hiassen, a columnist for The Miami Herald, has described
the restoration project as ``the most ambitious plumbing repair in
the history of the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress is considering authorizing an early round of funding
for the restoration, which is estimated to cost $7.8 billion and
take more than 20 years to complete.
</P>
<P>
   As proposed, the federal government would pay half the cost, and
the remaining half would come from Florida and local agencies
there.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water
Management District would play leading roles in the project. But
there's already bickering about the financial burden likely to be
borne by various entities within Florida, including Miami-Dade
County government.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of damage imposed by humans, the Everglades is
suffering from a greatly diminished water flow that has caused
great harm to animal and plant life while also threatening the
commercial fishing, sport fishing and tourism industries of South
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to provide an adequate water supply for the human
population in the fast-growing region also has been imperiled.
</P>
<P>
   South Florida, which had only a half million people when
Everglades National Park was created in 1947, now has 6 million
people and is expected to have 12 million or more by 2050.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was the Army Corps of Engineers, targeted to help
direct the Everglades' restoration, that played a preeminent role
in its environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1940s, two monumental events in the Glades' history
occurred. Everglades National Park was created, and Congress
directed the corps to oversee a gargantuan flood control project
for South Florida after two hurricanes that had killed thousands of
people and caused widespread flooding.
</P>
<P>
   During the next 25 years, the corps built 1,400 miles of canals,
levees, dikes and pump stations that, while reducing flood damage,
also diverted much of the Glades' flow of fresh water by taking it
out to the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a staggering amount of water _ an estimated 1.7 billion
gallons a day _ is flushed out to sea. As a result, the Everglades
has been severely drained, and serious water shortages loom in
coming decades in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Under the restoration project, a sizable portion of the corps'
system of canals, dikes and levees would be dismantled and more
water would be directed through the Glades in an attempt to return
it closer to its natural state.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Everglades National Park Web site, the numbers
of wading birds nesting in the southern Everglades has declined by
93 percent since the 1930s _ from 265,000 to 18,500. These birds
include herons, egrets, ibis and storks.
</P>
<P>
   There also has been great damage to the habitat of animals such
as the Florida panther (now believed to number only a few dozen),
the West Indian manatee, the American crocodile and various species
of turtles.
</P>
<P>
   Human tinkering also has fostered the growth of unwanted plants
_ notably cattails _ at the expense of native vegetation such as
the Everglades' signature sawgrass.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Times-Union in Jacksonville has described the
Everglades as ``the kidney of the entire state's water system,
filtering out impurities in the water as it flowed into the
Atlantic Ocean and Florida Bay at the south end of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   But that filtering ability has been diminished by the alteration
of the Glades' water flow. Further damage has been done by
pollutants from sugar cane farms and other agricultural activity
north of the Glades. The result is that the quality of South
Florida's drinking water is threatened.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   Under the restoration plan, much of the water now diverted to
the east or west _ where it dumps into the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf
of Mexico _ would be captured and sent through the Everglades, just
as occurred before humans started draining what turn-of-the-century
Florida Gov. Napoleon Bonaparte Broward had dubbed ``that
abominable, pestilence-ridden swamp.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, under the Everglades Forever Act passed by the Florida
Legislature in 1994, giant manmade marshes known as stormwater
treatment areas are being created over tens of thousands of acres
to snare agricultural runoff and filter impurities out of it. This
is being done primarily in the area south of huge Lake Okeechobee,
north of the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   One of the negative effects of altering the Everglades' water
flow has been to change the proportions of fresh and salt water in
the bays and estuaries of South Florida. These changes have damaged
breeding grounds for fish, shrimp and crab.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Texas increasingly faces threats to its coastal bays
and estuaries, said Myron Hess, an attorney in Austin for the
National Wildlife Federation, which supports the Everglades'
restoration project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will we be reaching a point to where we're having to try to
restore our bays and estuaries?'' Hess said of the Texas coastline.
``Let's hope we're a little earlier in the process where we can
avoid a lot of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Blackburn, an environmental lawyer from Houston, said the
damage wrought to Florida's bays and estuaries could be repeated in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Already, freshwater river flows to bays and estuaries on the
Texas coast have been altered as a result of increasing demands for
water in an often-dry state with a rapidly growing population,
Blackburn said. That could damage coastal areas that are important
breeding grounds for oysters, crab, shrimp and fish such as
speckled trout, redfish and flounder, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to make sure we don't make the same mistakes they
did in Florida,'' where ``it's costing billions of dollars to fix
it,'' Blackburn said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bauer director of the National Wildlife Federation's
Everglades project office in Florida, said the Glades' restoration
should be important to all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just Florida's Everglades,'' he said. ``It's
America's Everglades, just as the Grand Canyon is not just
Arizona's Grand Canyon and Yosemite is not just California's
Yosemite ... the Everglades' beauty and uniqueness is known
throughout the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The restoration plan was put together by the Army Corps of
Engineers and state and federal scientists. It has the backing of
several major environmental groups, including the National Audubon
Society, the World Wildlife Fund and the National Wildlife
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   But there are critics. Sierra Club officials and others, for
example, have expressed concern that the plan might become
primarily a huge water supply project for South Florida, thus
helping ensure more development and population growth there, rather
than being first and foremost an Everglades restoration effort.
</P>
<P>
   An explanation of the plan (on the Web site
www.evergladesplan.org) says that it ``will ensure a reliable,
adequate supply of fresh water for the environment, as well as
urban and agricultural users,'' with 80 percent going for
environmental purposes and 20 percent for urban and agricultural
water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens for a Sound Economy, a group known for a somewhat
libertarian viewpoint, has questioned why Congress would support an
expensive restoration while at the same time approving subsidies
for big Florida sugar cane growers whose farms have contributed to
the Glades' environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the plan itself, a huge political fight is brewing
over whether to create a large commercial airport and related
development at the former Homestead Air Force Base, which is only
10 miles east of Everglades National Park and two miles west of
Biscayne National Park.
</P>
<P>
   With a projected 245,000 flights a year, including flights over
the Glades, the airport would pose a huge pollution threat from
noise and runoff, environmental groups say. Critics oppose such an
airport and say that any development there should be less
environmentally threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club warns that park visitors ``would be constantly
bombarded by the high pitch blasts of engine turbines.'' Fish,
mammals and birds would face threats from pollution runoff from the
development, the organization said.
</P>
<P>
   Some find it ironic that the Army Corps of Engineers, which
constructed much of the flood-control system that damaged the
Everglades, is poised to play a leading role in attempting to undo
that damage. But the corps' engineering expertise and knowledge of
the Glades will be an asset in carrying out the restoration, some
observers say.
</P>
<P>
   When the corps undertook the flood-control program beginning in
the late 1940s, it did so at the behest of Congress and in the wake
of highly destructive hurricanes that caused major flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Blackburn, the Houston environmental lawyer, says the corps has
a ``remarkable staff'' and is ``probably more qualified than
anybody else'' to restore the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give them a project, and they'll find a way to do it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Adams, a National Audubon Society lobbyist in Washington,
said the corps' flood control effort was ``a project of the best
intentions based on the values of the time. They were taming nature
for human habitation. A lot of good has come out of it for Florida,
in terms of economic development. But looking at it in the lenses
of our times, great harm has been done as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The consensus is that the Everglades must be restored, but there
is great uncertainty as to how effective the complex restoration
plan will be.
</P>
<P>
   Most interested parties agree that it would be the kiss of death
for the Glades if nothing were done.
</P>
<P>
   Hiassen, the Miami Herald columnist, wrote in May that ``the
whole endeavor might end up as a bust.'' But it's a gamble that
must be undertaken, even if the results are highly uncertain, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final verdict will come from our grandchildren and
great-grandchildren,'' he wrote. ``They'll forgive us for failing,
but not for failing to try.''

SPORTS OF THE TIMES: FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT, RUNNING THE GOOD
RACE

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ We often talk about people carrying the
weight of the world on their shoulders, but never really mean it as
much more than a metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night in Sydney, we meant it.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Freeman, the pride of Australia, the joy of the Aborigine
people, carried this continent 400 meters across the finish line
and light years farther.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old Freeman ended a four-year journey in just 49.11
seconds to become the first Aborigine to win an individual Olympic
gold medal. The news media coverage was so intense, the adulation
so smothering that it had become a threat. A silver medal would
have been accepted graciously, but in reality, another second-place
finish would be counted as a loss.
</P>
<P>
   As Freeman ran Monday night, all the nerves, all the
anticipation, the 112,524 fans screaming and cheering for history,
provided the fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very nervous,'' she said after the race, ``but I heard
this voice in my head just telling me to do what I know, do what I
know. As long as I did that, I'd be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman didn't run the race of her life _ she had run 48.6
seconds, her personal best, in Atlanta. She ran the race of
hundreds of thousands of other lives. And she ran with a certain
fury, knowing that when she finished _ when she won _ she would be
free for the first time in nearly four years, since she finished
second to Marie-Jose Perec at the 1996 Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Perec left town last week. Under normal circumstances, critics
might say the defending champion had robbed the new champion of the
joy of snatching her crown. But Monday night, after the first of
many waves of excitement had washed up and gone away, Freeman gave
Perec an eloquent farewell bouquet. Freeman knew her time had come,
and Perec's had passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was more happy for her because she made the decision,''
Freeman said. ``I know her well enough to know she's a very proud
athlete, and I respect her for what she represents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She decided she wasn't ready to run and she didn't want to
run,'' she added. ``The only important thing is that she's happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorraine Graham of Jamaica, the silver medalist, and Katharine
Merry of Britain, who won the bronze, were ready to run the race of
their lives. Freeman and Graham were even coming out of the final
turn. Some will say that the uproar of the Aussies carried Freeman
to the finish line. In the final 50 meters, Freeman pulled away
from Graham and broke the tape. Exhausted and delirious, Freeman
began the process of winding down by sitting on the track for two
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could feel the crowd around me, all over me,'' she said. ``I
felt everybody's emotion. Happiness and joy absorbed into every
pore of my body. I had to sit down to make myself feel normal and
get comfortable. It was beyond words.''
</P>
<P>
   First, she went over to her mother and stepfather. Then, in the
most symbolic act of all, Freeman took a victory lap with both the
Australian and Aboriginal flags. Finally, she was free.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, she said she hopes ``what's happened tonight will
make a difference in people's attitudes: To the person walking in
the street, their attitude; people in the political arena, their
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that I've made a lot of people happy, with all
kinds of backgrounds who call Australia home,'' Freeman said. ``And
I'm happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The anticipation, emotion and history surrounding Freeman's race
was too wide, too high, too vast to be overwhelmed by the news that
C.J. Hunter, the 1999 world champion in the shot put and husband of
the sprinter Marion Jones, had tested positive for a banned
steroid.
</P>
<P>
   For this one night, fans and citizens savored a long-awaited
treasure; Cathy Freeman savored the moment and said it would not
change her.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my simple world, when I wake up in the morning, I have
breakfast and I clean my teeth and life's very normal when I'm on
my own,'' she said. ``If anything will change, it will be the way
everybody treats me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the main difference within myself will be the fact that
I'm pleased that I withstood the pressure and won the gold medal.''
</P>
<P>
   Many decades from now, when her racing days are long past, she
will still have her most valuable possession. Freeman will carry a
torch around a stadium the way the former Australian Olympians did
before Freeman ignited the caldron in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Someone will remember Sept. 25, 2000. Someone will say then what
you can say now without equivocation: Cathy Freeman fought the good
fight. She ran the good race.

aiming stationary cannons at moving targets. The bank and the fund
are, by the standards of huge bureaucracies, changing quickly,
largely because of outside pressure. And they are arguably doing a
better job than the mostly white, mostly middle-class protesters of
cultivating support among the poor. By Joseph Kahn.

LIVING ON A CALORIE-RESTRICTED DIET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Canada)   (Science Times)  
 By ERIC NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many people discussing the rigors of being on a diet,
Jeffrey A. Behrendt, a lawyer in Ottawa, sounded both plaintive and
hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still eat chocolate!'' Behrendt wrote in a note. ``Just a
lot less than before.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the downside.
</P>
<P>
   There is the problem of buying a suit when one's jacket size is
36 tall and one's waist is 28. (``This is not easy to find in
stores!'') There is the problem of sitting down. (``If the chair is
not well padded, I find it uncomfortable.'') Then there is the
problem of how people react to Behrendt's new look. (``Very
negative! People started thinking I was very ill and I got comments
that I looked like a concentration camp survivor.'')
</P>
<P>
   Behrendt is among a small group of people who have put
themselves on what they call a calorie-restricted diet. They
consume 30 percent to 40 percent fewer calories than what would be
considered normal, with a single goal: prolonging their lives to
age 100, 120, even 140.
</P>
<P>
   The technique has appeared promising in tests on mice, and
experiments on monkeys that are under way also suggest that their
aging has been slowed. But no one knows whether it works in humans.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Behrendt is one of at least hundreds, and very
likely more, people who have begun the regimen. They are a bold
band of experimenters, one part guinea pig, one part scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some freely own up to being a tad on the grumpy side.
Maybe it is the cold hands and feet that many of them experience.
Maybe it is the decline in sexual interest many report. Maybe it is
the social isolation some say such a radical diet imposes on them.
Or maybe it is just that much of the time, they are just a little
bit hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the followers of the C.R. (for calories restricted)
diet, as the practice is known, were inspired by the writings of
Dr. Roy Walford, a researcher at the University of California at
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Michael A. Sherman, a software company owner in Mountain View,
Calif., said a friend gave him one of Walford's books about three
years ago, when he turned 40 and was starting to worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sort of hit me pretty suddenly; everything's fine, but
you're just moving in the wrong direction,'' he recalled. ``It just
suddenly struck me that I was going to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman went from consuming about 3,200 calories a day to taking
1,725. At 5 five feet 5, he weighs 122 pounds, down from about 145.
He says he has seen tangible improvements in health indicators like
his cholesterol levels and heart rate.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman says that he is rarely hungry, that his mental energy is
good, and that his physical energy is sufficient to allow him to
work out and run several times a week.
</P>
<P>
   But Sherman, who is married and has two children, says he has
seen a decline in sexual interest, which he is combating by trying
different preparations of testosterone. He has no qualms about
whether he is following a ``natural'' approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what nature's plan is for me,'' Sherman said. ``It
wants me to decay and die pretty soon. So I don't really put a lot
of stock in sort of trying to be natural. So far, there's been
about 50 billion humans _ and they all died, except for the last 6
billion. So that's what you get if you do things the natural way.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman has other plans. He wants to see the 22nd Century, and
to do so, he needs to live to age 143.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said that, unlike some C.R. followers, he is not
fixated on his diet. He goes out to restaurants often, ordering
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   T. Francesca Skelton, a 60-year-old Washington woman who has
been on the diet for about four months, said she noticed that it
seemed to attract some fanatics. ``They really wouldn't eat a bread
crumb if it wasn't on the diet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That, said Dr. Gail C. Frank, a nutrition professor at
California State University at Long Beach, is the big drawback.
While she admires the intent behind the diet, Frank said the
approach was too extreme.
</P>
<P>
   ``What good is the aging if there can't be the pleasure to go
with it?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   For Behrendt, 30, it has not been easy. Since going on the diet,
he has lost 20 pounds, so that now, at 6 feet, he weighs 120
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, he said that, on the whole, he felt
better. But with his consumption of just 1,800 calories day, he can
no longer do the long-distance running he once enjoyed . He feels
more prone to irritability and depression. And he has had trouble
getting others to accept his decision, especially his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of families, mine included, show their love by a cooking
a big meal for you,'' Behrendt said. ``They they're really
insulted. You go there and you hardly eat anything.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   We've all worked with people who are star performers but have
one serious personality shortcoming that makes life difficult for
everyone, limits their effectiveness and often proves to be their
professional undoing.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of one executive we worked with, such people are
''95 percent brilliant, 5 percent disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tactics that you can use to help these otherwise
valuable people get beyond their psychological limitations.
</P>
<P>
   THE HERO
</P>
<P>
   The hero is often the last person a manager wants to change.
After all, why would you want to tamper with someone who gets more
done in a day than others do in a week?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that over the long term, the hero's constant
pushing adds real costs to the bottom line even if those costs are
obscured by short-term results.
</P>
<P>
   If you look carefully at the hero's trail, you'll probably find
the footprints of valuable people who left the company after trying
to keep up with the hero's superhuman exertions. Within the
company, you'll find burned-out co-workers. And the hero himself
may be thoroughly spent, too.
</P>
<P>
   Some heroes become addicted to success at an early age; others
push as a way of dealing with their own shaky self-esteem. An ``I'm
gonna show them'' mentality. Clearly, heroes lack the empathy
needed to understand what others are going through to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   To change a hero's behavior, express your appreciation for his
accomplishments. Then quickly segue into a discussion about the
costs of burnout _ in himself and in his team members.
</P>
<P>
   The hero must learn to take regular readings of his team's
temperature and to pay attention to body language, facial
expressions and energy levels that subtly indicate resistance or
dismay.
</P>
<P>
   As the hero's manager, you may want to help him make a checklist
of warning signs that the temperature is getting too hot: for
example, the times that he and others are leaving voice messages
and e-mails, the rising levels of illness among employees and
reports of marital troubles. The hero should fill out the list
weekly and discuss it with you.
</P>
<P>
   Heroes have to think more about winning the war and less about
the individual battles. Emphasize that you need your hero to make
strategic decisions; he should delegate the implementation whenever
possible. You might even encourage him to hire an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it is essential that someone take on the official role
of observing the hero. The goal is to turn down the volume without
switching it off. You could do this yourself, or help your hero
choose a trusted co-worker to carry out this task.
</P>
<P>
   THE MERITOCRAT
</P>
<P>
   Meritocrats believe that the world is a fair market in which the
best ideas will always win on their own merit. Such people
typically excelled at school and were consistently rewarded for
getting the highest score. Thus they have a naive reliance on the
authority of objective, measurable facts. They never accepted that
in the real world, ideas have to be sold, negotiated and shaped to
meet political and organizational realities.
</P>
<P>
   To help a meritocrat, you should first offer sympathy. Agree
that it's really an awful waste of time to have to persuade people
to support ideas of clear merit.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to raise a very difficult question: ``How
effective do you want to be?'' We've done this ourselves by using
Jimmy Carter as an example. Carter, we say, was a highly principled
and intelligent president who stayed unswervingly true to his
ideals. And yet even the most die-hard Democrat would agree that
Ronald Reagan was more effective than Carter at winning
congressional and public support for his agenda. We ask, ``Do you
want to be 100 percent pure, like Carter, or do you want to be
effective, like Reagan? You must choose one or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   A manager needs to help them see that it is possible to operate
in gray areas, accomplish a great deal and still emerge relatively
unsullied.
</P>
<P>
   Like the hero, the meritocrat has to learn much more about his
team. For each member, he needs to ask himself: What does this
person work for _ big money, prestige, intellectual challenge,
acquisition of power? Only when the meritocrat understands and
takes into account individual differences can he figure out how to
get people to support his goals and make their strongest
contribution to a project.
</P>
<P>
   THE BULLDOZER
</P>
<P>
   Bulldozers are people who decided early on that the world is a
hostile place where you should do unto others before they do unto
you _ plus 10 percent. They don't trust others, and others don't
trust them. At the same time, they're extremely loyal to their
bosses, and they get things done _ which is why they're worth
trying to help.
</P>
<P>
   Bulldozers are often reluctant to change a style that, by their
lights, is highly effective. So to change a bulldozer, you have to
become one yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Start by asking him if he has any idea how many enemies he has
created within the company. Follow this with a powerful line we've
used in our consulting: ``If I put it to a vote, there's no
question _ you'd be fired.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat of being fired is usually quite motivating. If the
bulldozer says he's willing to listen, the next step is to begin a
campaign of rapprochement. Tell him to make a list of his victims.
Then the two of you should script out an apology for each one.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate goal, of course, is to get the bulldozer to avoid
causing damage in the first place. To do that, he has to become
more aware of when he is about to roll over someone so he can stop
himself.
</P>
<P>
   As with a hero, it's a good idea at the beginning to agree on
someone the bulldozer trusts to monitor his behavior. If the
bulldozer shows a willingness to change, he'll be able to build
roads for you without flattening people in his way.
</P>
<P>
   THE PESSIMIST
</P>
<P>
   Pessimists' worries are sometimes justified _ they're based on a
knowledge of mistakes that others have made. More frequently,
though, pessimists simply stifle creativity and block fruitful
opportunities. They also tend to micromanage, looking over
everyone's shoulders lest a mistake be made.
</P>
<P>
   Pessimists are motivated primarily by a fear of shame of being
wrong or inadequate. And avoidance of shame can spread insidiously
throughout an organization's culture, destroying the company's
capacity to innovate and take risks.
</P>
<P>
   Tell the pessimist that you're on his side in looking at
proposals for change with appropriate caution. That positioning
lets you avoid a pointless wrangle over the pros and cons of any
particular initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Then point out that you're afraid that the impact of his alarms
is diminishing. Moreover, he's giving the other members of his
group a free ride: ``They don't have to worry and express their
reservations. You do that.'' The message: It's OK to worry, but
your fears must do more than guard the status quo; they should have
a constructive edge.
</P>
<P>
   Teach him how to evaluate risk better. Tell your pessimist that
when a change initiative is proposed, he must consider the pros and
cons of making the change as well as the pros and cons of doing
nothing. This way, he will be forced into a more objective risk
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   THE REBEL
</P>
<P>
   Although they fancy themselves as revolutionaries, rebels'
protests against ``the system'' don't go beyond simple grousing.
They're the ones who ask the inappropriate questions in meetings,
make jokes about the company's management and publicly question the
motives behind any major change.
</P>
<P>
   What rebels enjoy most is a game of tug of war. So your first
tactic is to refuse to play.
</P>
<P>
   Co-opt the rebel by making him responsible for a relatively
high-profile task that requires him to win the cooperation of
others. In essence, you pull him out of the heckling audience and
push him into the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Another approach is to begin by asking the rebel, in a neutral
tone, if he's thinking about quitting. When he says no (with
surprise), tell him that you were wondering because he always seems
to be butting up against the limits and putting the organization
down. If he says, ``No, I'm only kidding around,'' come back
forcefully: ``I don't buy that. And in any event, the things you
say hurt people and the morale of the group. That must stop!''
</P>
<P>
   Then shift to a different gear: ``But more to the point, you
seem to think that a lot of things around here should be changed.
True? Well, right now you're about as effective a revolutionary as
a 3-year-old. If you're going to battle the counterproductive
aspects of the `regime,' why not do it effectively?''
</P>
<P>
   Now you have the chance to help your rebel become a real leader
of change. His first assignment should be to spend a week as a
cultural anthropologist, noting all the subtle elements of your
organization's culture: what people reveal about their personal
lives; how they align in groups; how decisions are made officially
and how they are really made; and so on. You should require him to
hand you a written report.
</P>
<P>
   Then ask: ``If you were a real revolutionary fighting somewhere
against a dictatorship, would it be better to stand out or to blend
in?'' The answer is clear, so push the rebel to the logical
conclusion. ``You have a choice. You can work to change things here
or you can follow your old pattern and just be an irritant. If you
choose the latter, your career will stall. We need people like you
to help improve this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being negative just for its own sake, he'll turn his
energies toward constructive criticism and the building of a better
company.
</P>
<P>
   THE HOME RUN HITTER
</P>
<P>
   The home run hitter is always imagining the roar of the crowd
when the ball clears the outfield fence. However, he tends to
strike out a lot, swinging for the fence when a simple base hit
would have helped the team. Put simply, home run hitters focus on
things that are too big too soon.
</P>
<P>
   As a home run hitter's manager, you need to deliver two
messages: (1) you appreciate his drive, ambition and
self-confidence; and (2) you want to move him up the curve as
quickly as possible but at a pace that ensures his steady progress
_ he must stay with the program.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to explain just what the program, be it
spending time overseas or working more with particular clients.
Look at people in positions that he aspires to and explain their
career trajectories; that way, he'll understand that they didn't
just walk in and take over.
</P>
<P>
   Home run hitters worry that they'll never get ahead, and they
feel that their strenuous efforts go unappreciated. Therefore, talk
with them often about their career progression and praise them
frequently. This will help reassure your home run hitter that,
given a little time, he'll have his shot at the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Although the tactics we recommend here won't work in every case,
they can help turn some of your brilliantly flawed performers into
spectacular achievers _ to the benefit of themselves and your
company.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Anti-business protesters have always sought to gain the upper
hand over the corporations they target. In one theater of conflict,
the Internet, they are succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by a combination of passion and tech savvy, activists
have launched sophisticated sites that attack individual companies
with eye-catching images, useful links, forceful prose, and even
audio and video streams.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, most corporate sites either avoid controversial
issues, such as labor and environmental practices, or address them
with little more than bland text on hard-to-find pages.
</P>
<P>
   Take the issue of genetic modification. The UK government
cabinet office posts special Web pages to allay public concerns
about the safety of genetically modified food products
(www.cabinet-office. gov.uk/gm-info). They contain lengthy policy
statements and submissions from scientists and regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Turn now to www.gm-info.org.uk, the Web site operated by
Corporate Watch. It contains lively, interesting and well-reasoned
articles on the risks associated with genetic modification,
flowcharts showing how business and government interests collide
and case studies targeting the leading biotech companies. It even
features a detailed map of the United Kingdom showing locations of
crop trials and manufacturing and storage facilities. The site as a
whole is brilliant propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   This imbalance between corporate and protest sites is a problem
for two reasons. First, the Internet tilts the playing field in the
activist's favor. On the Web, the reach of a corporate
public-relations machine is no greater than that of any
organization committed to a cause. Moreover, the Web allows
protests to develop almost spontaneously among loose clusters of
organizations and individuals. When no single group is responsible
for a particular action, it's hard to know how to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the protest sites often have huge constituencies. The
World Wildlife Fund has about 5 million members; Greenpeace has 2.5
million. Corporate Watch claims more than 1 million page views per
month on its Web site, which contains some 430 links to other
protest sites.
</P>
<P>
   In the United Kingdom, the Royal Society for the Protection of
Birds has a larger membership than any other political organization
in the country, including the Labour and Conservative parties.
Given numbers like these, it's clear that an effectively produced
site can have a major impact on public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have begun to respond. BP Amoco, for example,
recently upgraded its Web site to reflect the company's shift
toward more open dialogue with a wide range of stakeholders. It
used Greenpeace's visually appealing Shareholders Against New
Exploration (SANE) campaign, which had been aimed at BP Amoco, as a
reference point in redesigning its own site. The corporate site now
has links to environmental information, and one click brings the
viewer to a detailed explanation of the company's efforts to
explore solar energy.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site can watch an animated ``solar story,'' with
audio, that debunks several myths about supposed problems with
solar power.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that heavily attacked companies such as BP
Amoco and Shell are taking a more open approach to communications
on environmental and social issues. They are debating these issues
in terms that the protest groups use, setting out the choices and
dilemmas they face, and being honest about failures as well as
successes.
</P>
<P>
   They are using the Web, in part, to say, ``We're not perfect. We
don't have the answer to every issue, but we're working with the
best intentions. Here are the issues we have trouble with. Tell us
what you think of them.'
</P>
<P>
   Any major corporation could be subject to a Web attack at almost
any time. In the struggle for hearts and minds, companies would do
well to learn from those attacking them by bringing a measure of
passion and creativity to their own Web presence.

<TEXT>
<P>
   We've all worked with people who are star performers but have
one serious personality shortcoming that makes life difficult for
everyone, limits their effectiveness and often proves to be their
professional undoing.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of one executive we worked with, such people are
''95 percent brilliant, 5 percent disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tactics that you can use to help these otherwise
valuable people get beyond their psychological limitations.
</P>
<P>
   THE HERO
</P>
<P>
   The hero is often the last person a manager wants to change.
After all, why would you want to tamper with someone who gets more
done in a day than others do in a week?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that over the long term, the hero's constant
pushing adds real costs to the bottom line even if those costs are
obscured by short-term results.
</P>
<P>
   If you look carefully at the hero's trail, you'll probably find
the footprints of valuable people who left the company after trying
to keep up with the hero's superhuman exertions. Within the
company, you'll find burned-out co-workers. And the hero himself
may be thoroughly spent, too.
</P>
<P>
   Some heroes become addicted to success at an early age; others
push as a way of dealing with their own shaky self-esteem. An ``I'm
gonna show them'' mentality. Clearly, heroes lack the empathy
needed to understand what others are going through to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   To change a hero's behavior, express your appreciation for his
accomplishments. Then quickly segue into a discussion about the
costs of burnout _ in himself and in his team members.
</P>
<P>
   The hero must learn to take regular readings of his team's
temperature and to pay attention to body language, facial
expressions and energy levels that subtly indicate resistance or
dismay.
</P>
<P>
   As the hero's manager, you may want to help him make a checklist
of warning signs that the temperature is getting too hot: for
example, the times that he and others are leaving voice messages
and e-mails, the rising levels of illness among employees and
reports of marital troubles. The hero should fill out the list
weekly and discuss it with you.
</P>
<P>
   Heroes have to think more about winning the war and less about
the individual battles. Emphasize that you need your hero to make
strategic decisions; he should delegate the implementation whenever
possible. You might even encourage him to hire an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it is essential that someone take on the official role
of observing the hero. The goal is to turn down the volume without
switching it off. You could do this yourself, or help your hero
choose a trusted co-worker to carry out this task.
</P>
<P>
   THE MERITOCRAT
</P>
<P>
   Meritocrats believe that the world is a fair market in which the
best ideas will always win on their own merit. Such people
typically excelled at school and were consistently rewarded for
getting the highest score. Thus they have a naive reliance on the
authority of objective, measurable facts. They never accepted that
in the real world, ideas have to be sold, negotiated and shaped to
meet political and organizational realities.
</P>
<P>
   To help a meritocrat, you should first offer sympathy. Agree
that it's really an awful waste of time to have to persuade people
to support ideas of clear merit.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to raise a very difficult question: ``How
effective do you want to be?'' We've done this ourselves by using
Jimmy Carter as an example. Carter, we say, was a highly principled
and intelligent president who stayed unswervingly true to his
ideals. And yet even the most die-hard Democrat would agree that
Ronald Reagan was more effective than Carter at winning
congressional and public support for his agenda. We ask, ``Do you
want to be 100 percent pure, like Carter, or do you want to be
effective, like Reagan? You must choose one or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   A manager needs to help them see that it is possible to operate
in gray areas, accomplish a great deal and still emerge relatively
unsullied.
</P>
<P>
   Like the hero, the meritocrat has to learn much more about his
team. For each member, he needs to ask himself: What does this
person work for _ big money, prestige, intellectual challenge,
acquisition of power? Only when the meritocrat understands and
takes into account individual differences can he figure out how to
get people to support his goals and make their strongest
contribution to a project.
</P>
<P>
   THE BULLDOZER
</P>
<P>
   Bulldozers are people who decided early on that the world is a
hostile place where you should do unto others before they do unto
you _ plus 10 percent. They don't trust others, and others don't
trust them. At the same time, they're extremely loyal to their
bosses, and they get things done _ which is why they're worth
trying to help.
</P>
<P>
   Bulldozers are often reluctant to change a style that, by their
lights, is highly effective. So to change a bulldozer, you have to
become one yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Start by asking him if he has any idea how many enemies he has
created within the company. Follow this with a powerful line we've
used in our consulting: ``If I put it to a vote, there's no
question _ you'd be fired.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat of being fired is usually quite motivating. If the
bulldozer says he's willing to listen, the next step is to begin a
campaign of rapprochement. Tell him to make a list of his victims.
Then the two of you should script out an apology for each one.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate goal, of course, is to get the bulldozer to avoid
causing damage in the first place. To do that, he has to become
more aware of when he is about to roll over someone so he can stop
himself.
</P>
<P>
   As with a hero, it's a good idea at the beginning to agree on
someone the bulldozer trusts to monitor his behavior. If the
bulldozer shows a willingness to change, he'll be able to build
roads for you without flattening people in his way.
</P>
<P>
   THE PESSIMIST
</P>
<P>
   Pessimists' worries are sometimes justified _ they're based on a
knowledge of mistakes that others have made. More frequently,
though, pessimists simply stifle creativity and block fruitful
opportunities. They also tend to micromanage, looking over
everyone's shoulders lest a mistake be made.
</P>
<P>
   Pessimists are motivated primarily by a fear of shame of being
wrong or inadequate. And avoidance of shame can spread insidiously
throughout an organization's culture, destroying the company's
capacity to innovate and take risks.
</P>
<P>
   Tell the pessimist that you're on his side in looking at
proposals for change with appropriate caution. That positioning
lets you avoid a pointless wrangle over the pros and cons of any
particular initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Then point out that you're afraid that the impact of his alarms
is diminishing. Moreover, he's giving the other members of his
group a free ride: ``They don't have to worry and express their
reservations. You do that.'' The message: It's OK to worry, but
your fears must do more than guard the status quo; they should have
a constructive edge.
</P>
<P>
   Teach him how to evaluate risk better. Tell your pessimist that
when a change initiative is proposed, he must consider the pros and
cons of making the change as well as the pros and cons of doing
nothing. This way, he will be forced into a more objective risk
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   THE REBEL
</P>
<P>
   Although they fancy themselves as revolutionaries, rebels'
protests against ``the system'' don't go beyond simple grousing.
They're the ones who ask the inappropriate questions in meetings,
make jokes about the company's management and publicly question the
motives behind any major change.
</P>
<P>
   What rebels enjoy most is a game of tug of war. So your first
tactic is to refuse to play.
</P>
<P>
   Co-opt the rebel by making him responsible for a relatively
high-profile task that requires him to win the cooperation of
others. In essence, you pull him out of the heckling audience and
push him into the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Another approach is to begin by asking the rebel, in a neutral
tone, if he's thinking about quitting. When he says no (with
surprise), tell him that you were wondering because he always seems
to be butting up against the limits and putting the organization
down. If he says, ``No, I'm only kidding around,'' come back
forcefully: ``I don't buy that. And in any event, the things you
say hurt people and the morale of the group. That must stop!''
</P>
<P>
   Then shift to a different gear: ``But more to the point, you
seem to think that a lot of things around here should be changed.
True? Well, right now you're about as effective a revolutionary as
a 3-year-old. If you're going to battle the counterproductive
aspects of the `regime,' why not do it effectively?''
</P>
<P>
   Now you have the chance to help your rebel become a real leader
of change. His first assignment should be to spend a week as a
cultural anthropologist, noting all the subtle elements of your
organization's culture: what people reveal about their personal
lives; how they align in groups; how decisions are made officially
and how they are really made; and so on. You should require him to
hand you a written report.
</P>
<P>
   Then ask: ``If you were a real revolutionary fighting somewhere
against a dictatorship, would it be better to stand out or to blend
in?'' The answer is clear, so push the rebel to the logical
conclusion. ``You have a choice. You can work to change things here
or you can follow your old pattern and just be an irritant. If you
choose the latter, your career will stall. We need people like you
to help improve this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being negative just for its own sake, he'll turn his
energies toward constructive criticism and the building of a better
company.
</P>
<P>
   THE HOME RUN HITTER
</P>
<P>
   The home run hitter is always imagining the roar of the crowd
when the ball clears the outfield fence. However, he tends to
strike out a lot, swinging for the fence when a simple base hit

recently upgraded its Web site to reflect the company's shift
toward more open dialogue with a wide range of stakeholders. It
used Greenpeace's visually appealing Shareholders Against New
Exploration (SANE) campaign, which had been aimed at BP Amoco, as a
reference point in redesigning its own site. The corporate site now
has links to environmental information, and one click brings the
viewer to a detailed explanation of the company's efforts to
explore solar energy.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site can watch an animated ``solar story,'' with
audio, that debunks several myths about supposed problems with
solar power.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that heavily attacked companies such as BP
Amoco and Shell are taking a more open approach to communications
on environmental and social issues. They are debating these issues
in terms that the protest groups use, setting out the choices and
dilemmas they face, and being honest about failures as well as
successes.
</P>
<P>
   They are using the Web, in part, to say, ``We're not perfect. We
don't have the answer to every issue, but we're working with the
best intentions. Here are the issues we have trouble with. Tell us
what you think of them.'
</P>
<P>
   Any major corporation could be subject to a Web attack at almost
any time. In the struggle for hearts and minds, companies would do
well to learn from those attacking them by bringing a measure of
passion and creativity to their own Web presence.

FORECASTERS IN SEARCH OF EL NINO AND LA NINA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Kan., Calif.)   (Science Times)  
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many parts of the Americas and Asia, the occasional warming
and cooling cycles in the tropical Pacific Ocean known as El Nino
and La Nina are unwelcome visitors _ barging in, usually with
little warning, then staying for months or sometimes a year or two,
bringing all kinds of baggage in the form of distorted patterns of
storms and droughts, heat and cold.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a record El Nino in 1997 and 1998, followed almost
immediately by a prolonged La Nina, the tropical Pacific has shaken
off its fever and chills and is expected for at least a year to be
``normal.''
</P>
<P>
   So one might think meteorologists could relax a bit. But it is
exactly the opposite, many of them say. Now they are sweating. With
no El Nino or La Nina, there is no sheep dog driving the sheep, no
strong organizing force giving shape to the otherwise chaotic flow
of weather across the seas and continents.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, long-term forecasts _ the ones that help determine
the price of oil or natural gas futures, the ones that determine
how much road salt your town buys this fall _ are looking a bit
like guesswork.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last three years, a lot of people have looked pretty
sharp,'' said Dr. William C. Patzert, a research oceanographer at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. ``Now the
going gets tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Oceanographers over the last 20 years have developed an
understanding of how El Nino and La Nina form _ with changes in
winds and atmospheric pressure allowing warm surface water to flow
east in an El Nino or spreading cool water west in a La Nina. They
have still not found a way to predict when one or the other will
develop.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the El Nino that formed in 1997 and boosted global
temperatures to record highs was unanticipated, as was its
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   But once one of the conditions settles into place,
meteorologists have become adept at predicting the consequences and
incorporating those patterns into long-term forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, Patzert said, the surface temperature of the tropical
Pacific varies only a few degrees Fahrenheit through the course of
a year. An El Nino can raise surface temperatures 14 degrees above
normal over an area three times the size of the contiguous United
States. A La Nina can drop it nearly 8 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   More heat causes more evaporation and more rising hot air,
meaning more storms. Cooler temperatures, Patzert said, create the
equivalent ``of a stone in a stream,'' nudging storm tracks and the
jet stream out of place.
</P>
<P>
   El Nino has been linked to strong winter storms that batter
southern California, to a weak hurricane season in the Atlantic as
high-altitude winds shear the towering tops from developing
tropical storms, to searing droughts in southern Asia like the one
that spawned enormous rain forest fires in Indonesia in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A La Nina, among other things, seems to nurture Atlantic
hurricanes, push the North American winter storm track further
north, and bring heat and drought to the West.
</P>
<P>
   Without either, weather becomes typical _ meaning largely
unpredictable _ meteorologists say.
</P>
<P>
   The government's long-term forecast maps for this winter retreat
largely to what meteorologists call ``climatology'' _ essentially a
tossup _ with most of North America given an even chance of having
below average, above average, or average temperatures.
Precipitation charts are a little less equivocal, but only a
little.
</P>
<P>
   To point out just how fuzzy things will be in coming months, Dr.
Tim P. Barnett, a marine physicist at the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography in San Diego, described government predictions for his
home town: ``For San Diego this winter, indicators range from
extremely heavy precipitation to very dry, with all categories
equally likely.''
</P>
<P>
   He said meteorologists, if they are prudent, will likely include
strong caveats in any long-term forecasts in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to say that's the way it is,'' Barnett said.
Without anything driving the system, he added, ``the atmosphere
tends to be its wonderful chaotic normal self, and that makes
forecasting very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that this may not always be the case. Dr. John
O. Roads, the director of the experimental climate prediction
center at Scripps, said that new work is showing that there are
plenty of other subtle influences on long-term weather that should
eventually improve predictions, even in years without the strong
influence from the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   He said that soil moisture and snow cover appear perceptibly to
influence seasonal weather patterns, adding that computer models at
Scripps are beginning to incorporate some of these variables with
some success.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be years before these forces are incorporated in
official forecasts issued by federal climate prediction centers, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   One place where the frontier of forecasting is already being
pushed is at private forecasting companies whose predictions are
sold to commodities traders, utilities, or other customers whose
business relies on anticipating future weather.
</P>
<P>
   To prosper, these companies have to offer a product that is
better than the government's forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   A false move can make or break a trader trying to anticipate the
price of winter wheat or heating oil or natural gas, said Drew
Lerner, a meteorologist for Bridge Global Weather Services, a
private forecasting company in Overland, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he and his competitors have to look at subtler
influences on weather, including things like sunspot cycles or soil
condition in the Midwest or other less obvious temperature shifts
in the Pacific and Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take all these things and try to put it all together,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among his predictions for this winter are a lack of strong
storms along the Atlantic coast, colder than normal temperatures in
the northern Plains and Great Lakes region, and abundant January
precipitation from the lower Middle West to the mid-Atlantic
seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   But it all would have been a lot easier if the last La Nina had
stuck around a few more months, Lerner said.

<P>
   A month after breaking her left leg and blowing out her right
knee in a skiing crash in Switzerland, Picabo Street, the fearless,
spunky media darling of the 1998 Nagano Olympics, shut herself in
the bedroom of her parents' house and closed the blinds. She would
not let family or friends in, she took no phone calls, did not
watch television, did nothing for weeks but lie there in the
darkened room thinking miserable thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through a huge depression,'' Street said. ``I went all
the way to rock bottom. I never thought that I ever would
experience anything like that in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   What sent her hurtling into a depression was the realization of
how long and difficult her recovery would be. In the end, it took
20 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a combination of the atrophying of my legs, the
new scars, and feeling like a caged animal,'' Street said. ``I went
from being a very physical person, a very powerful athlete, to
barely having any strength to get from my room to the kitchen.
You're stuck and you can't do what you normally do and it makes you
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Liesl Reichelt, 31, an investment banker and runner,
famous only in her circle of friends and family, stepped off a high
curb on her way to Central Park, landed hard and herniated a disk
in her spine.
</P>
<P>
   When her doctor told her to quit running for a few months,
Reichelt became depressed, moody and irritable, and she gained
weight. Then things started to snowball. She could no longer take
criticism at work, and she began to hate her boss, her job and New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was constantly snapping at my boyfriend,'' said Reichelt,
who now is running again. ``All I did was complain about not
running. It just left such a void, and there wasn't anything I
could think of doing to fill it.''
</P>
<P>
   For those athletes who made it to Sydney but were injured before
or in their events, their agony was palpable.
</P>
<P>
   But a suddenly sidelined athlete doesn't have to be competing on
the world stage to feel depressed. Even injured weekend athletes
are susceptible to depression, anxiety and other psychological
symptoms, including nightmares, flashbacks to the accident,
moodiness, irritability, fatigue, insomnia, weight gain and low
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the running world, it's expected that you get depressed if
you get injured,'' said Shelly-Lynn Florence, a running coach with
the New York Road Runners Club.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to pin down how common depression is among injured
athletes; research in this field of sport psychology is limited.
But one study of 343 male college athletes from a variety of sports
found that 51 percent had some symptoms of depression after being
injured, and 12 percent became moderately to severely depressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say one out of every four or five of the injured athletes
who come to our center suffer from depression,'' said Dr. Gerald
Kaforey of the Vanderbilt Sport Medicine Center at the Vanderbilt
Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Those who get depressed may stay that way for several weeks
after being injured, their mood lifting only as their injuries
begin to heal. Some athletes, especially those with longer recovery
periods, may stay depressed for months. And in rare instances,
injured athletes have attempted or committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Emotional reactions to injury may also affect how well people
comply with the rehabilitation regimens and how quickly and
completely they recover, according to research.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, only about 2 percent of sports medicine centers
have psychologists available to help patients, Kaforey said.
Although professional and Olympic athletes increasingly turn to
sports psychologists, these experts are usually called on to
improve the performance of great athletes, not to lift the moods of
those on crutches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We virtually ignore the psychological dynamics surrounding
sport injury,'' said Dr. Jane Crossman, who is editing a book on
how to help athletes cope with injury.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the sports world may be slow to acknowledge the
emotional fallout of an injury is the stigma some see in needing
help.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Deborah Saint-Phard, who treats patients at the Women's
Sports Medicine Center of the Hospital for Special Surgery in
Manhattan said, ``There's a pervasive sense that athletes are
superhuman, not only in their abilities to perform athletically,
but also in their morals, their ability to handle pain,
disappointment and injury.'' Saint-Phard, a former Olympic
shot-putter, is a physiatrist, a doctor who specializes in
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes themselves take on these expectations and may not
reveal to others how much they are suffering. Nicole Detling, who
tore a ligament in her knee while playing basketball in college a
few years ago, could not take people feeling sorry for her, so she
withdrew into her dorm room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was an athlete,'' Detling said. ``I not only had all this
physical strength, but I had mental strength. And being injured was
a huge kind of weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Early theories held that injured athletes went through the
stages of grief that Elizabeth Kubler-Ross defined in her
groundbreaking book ``On Death and Dying'' _ denial, anger,
bargaining, depression and acceptance. While some psychologists
still believe this model applies, most reserve it for those
athletes who are injured so severely that they cannot return to
their sport. ``For a pro or college athlete, a serious injury could
be very similar to losing a loved one, because that's their
vitality, that's their life,'' Kaforey said.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, athletes can feel a deep sense of loss or a void in
their lives. They lose not only the actual physical activity, but
the gratification they get from competing and the social aspects of
the sport. They may also lose that feeling of invulnerability and
absolute trust in their bodies. Elite athletes may lose the fame,
the travel, and sometimes the endorsements or salaries.
</P>
<P>
   With time away from their sport, athletes also lose a piece of
identity, especially if they earned recognition for their
athleticism early in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all the sudden you can't be an athlete, it sends you into a
bit of an existential crisis in terms of, `Who am I, and what am I
doing here?''' Saint-Phard said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This identity crisis can be particularly hard for younger
athletes, especially today. Children now tend to specialize in one
or two sports at a young age, instead of being involved in three or
four, said Dr. Aynsley Smith, research director of the Sports
Medicine Center at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the eggs are in one basket,'' Smith said. ``They have
significant goals, so many letters they want to earn. So when
injury comes, it's devastating for them. They often feel it has
totally wiped out almost their reason for being.''
</P>
<P>
   With people coming to sports as a way of moderating depression
or stress, warding off illnesses like heart disease or cancer, or
to lose weight, the stakes are higher. When injured, they not only
have to deal with the pain and stress of being injured, but they
have lost a primary coping strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Moody and depressed, some injured athletes are often left to
brood by themselves. Athletes complain that their friends and
family members are not always sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a nonathlete, it's hard to understand the importance
sports plays in someone's life,'' Crossman said.
</P>
<P>
   Detling, the former basketball player, said: ``I explained
myself over and over for a short time, and then I got frustrated
with it. Because no matter how much detail I'd give, they would
look at me with a blank face that said, `I don't really get it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Picabo Street came out of her depression and her bedroom on
Mother's Day, and has now resumed training for competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had gone over the pessimism so many times that it got old
and boring and I needed something else to go over,'' she said. ``So
I started thinking about what I had to be thankful for. What I came
to was how much my family loves and supports me. After four hours
of hashing it out, I got up and opened the door.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the first step toward becoming her old, cheerful self.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had to force myself every day to focus on the things
that were good, even though it was so easy to think of all the
things that were bad,'' she said.

FOLK REMEDIES, OFF THE SHELF AND OFF THE WALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By JOHN LANGONE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; ``More Chicken Soup and Other Folk Remedies,'' by Joan Wilen
and Lydia Wilen (Ballantine Books, $14). &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere around the 16th century, the Swiss alchemist
Paracelsus mixed mineral gold and salt and then let it ``digest''
in horse dung. When laced with wine, and drunk every day precisely
at dawn, the elixir was supposed to cure all diseases of the mind
and body. Blessedly, this entertaining little sequel to the Wilen
sisters' earlier testimonial to folk remedies does not contain any
Paracelsian cure-alls _ but some come awfully close.
</P>
<P>
   We learn that weak ankles may be strengthened by rubbing them
with raw oysters until the bivalves disintegrate; that fruits
beginning with the letter ``p'' are said to increase potency in men
and enhance sexual energy in women; that tying a red string around
one's waist may cure stomach-ache; that eating six raw almonds a
day may improve memory; and that eating exactly nine gin-soaked
raisins a day may relieve arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Thought-provoking stuff, this, and not all of it related to
health. There is an egg yolk shampoo (one yolk for thin and short,
three for thick and long), exercises to cure stage-fright, a beer
remedy for freckles, a way to keep rattlesnakes away by sleeping in
a circle of lariat ropes, and a diet of sunflower seeds to ward off
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   It is fair to say, though, that not all the remedies offered are
off the wall. Folk medicine has numerous modern spinoffs,
palliatives that acknowledge the beneficial health effects of food
components called phytochemicals, of fiber and a host of other
substances found in vegetables, fruits, cereals and herbs. The
resveratrol found in red wine, for example, has been shown to be a
potent antioxidant, the lycopene in tomatoes may indeed lower the
risk of prostate cancer, and the benefits of olive oil, broccoli
and tofu do seem to work more wonders than a churchful of saints.
</P>
<P>
   To their credit, the authors cite (where they can, which is no
easy task) research studies that indicate that hot chicken soup
clears mucous particles from the nose, that vitamin E can reduce
leg cramps, that raw carrots may lower cholesterol and that
flaxseed may well become the favored nutritional food of the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   Also, mindful that they may be accused of dispensing medical
advice without benefit of a license, the good sisters know enough
to salt their recipes and remedies with phrases like ``may help
to,'' ``supposed to prevent,'' ``it just may'' and ``while it
doesn't work for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the book is fun to read, and, like mother's chicken
soup, it cannot hurt you and may even help. Still, the reader would
do well to pay heed to the authors' comment after suggesting that
eating two small beets in the morning may cure constipation: ``If,
after trying these remedies, you still have a persisting problem,
you should see a health professional.''

 &HT;    RAISE HISPANIC STUDENTS TO PAR BY 2010, PANEL URGES
 &HT;    470&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The educational performance of Hispanic students
can and should be raised to the level of other American students by
2010, the President's Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence
for Hispanic Americans said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of economic security and national security that
we make sure that the fastest-growing community in the United
States does not fall behind, and that it is prepared to meet the
challenges that we have in the global economy,'' said Guillermo
Linares, a New York City Council member who chairs the panel of
prominent Hispanic civic, business, professional and government
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching the goal will require more resources and new
approaches, not just from educators but from many other groups, the
commission said in its final report. It was formed by President
Clinton to carry on the work of a similar body that advised his
predecessor, George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Besides suggesting ways to improve the quality and skills of
those teaching Hispanic children, the commission offered advice for
the children's families, community-based organizations, private
businesses and officials at all levels of government, including the
next president.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dozens of tips in the 76-page report were that parents
to read with their children and encourage high expectations, that
businesses offer internships, and that schools require all older
students to take algebra and geometry.
</P>
<P>
   The report also told inspiring stories of local efforts by
nonprofit groups to use government, business or charitable funds to
lift the academic achievement of Latino children.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why the report contained a variety of examples and
tips, rather than one or two highly focused recommendations,
Linares said, ``There is no single solution for resolving
inequities and gaps in educational achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic students are less likely than their peers to receive
pre-school education, score high on standardized tests, be assigned
to college-prep courses, attend well-financed schools, graduate
from high school, and enter or graduate from college.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond poverty and limited English proficiency, barriers that
the commission said must be overcome include low expectations by
teachers, administrators and parents, and the common practices of
tracking Hispanic children into non-academic classes, and isolating
them in schools with few resources and few Hispanic teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need changes and increased resources all along the
education pipeline from pre-school to graduate school,'' said
commission member Juliet Villareal Garcia, president of the
University of Texas at Brownsville. ``For example, we train the
teachers who educate the students who eventually end up in our
classes, so we have to improve our own performance in order to
improve theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   As Education Secretary Richard Riley formally accepted a copy of
the report on behalf of Clinton, he confessed that he already knew
what it said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read it last night during the Redskins football game,'' he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Endorsing the report, Riley said, ``The stakes are very, very
high. One-third of Hispanics are under the age of 18 (and) in less
than 25 years, one in four students in our public schools will be
Hispanics.''
</P>
<P>
   Rushed into print in English in order to appear during Hispanic
Heritage Month, the report will eventually be posted on the
commission's Web site and translated into Spanish.
</P>
<P>

202-401-1411 (not a free call) or write to White House Initiative

 &HT;    27-YEAR-OLD HEALTH ADVISER A KEY PART OF GORE CAMPAIGN TEAM

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Vice President Al Gore isn't quite sure about
some obscure detail of his health care plan, he will end his
remarks with a fleeting, almost unnoticed question: ``Isn't that
right, Sarah?''
</P>
<P>
   A quick nod, a thumbs-up or a clenched fist in the air from the
fidgety young woman who always seems to be nearby means the
Democratic presidential nominee has nailed it. A few words of
clarification or some additional details means he was close _ but
not close enough for Sarah.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Bianchi, a 27-year-old Atlanta native, is deputy domestic
affairs adviser to the Gore campaign. But the title understates the
way Gore has come to depend on her.
</P>
<P>
   By the vice president's assessment, Bianchi is ``scary smart'' _
a walking, talking encyclopedia of the way he intends to run
federal health care programs if he is elected president this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``Medicare at the Crossroads,'' the 74-page booklet Gore
released at a St. Petersburg, Fla., campaign event Monday, was
largely produced by Bianchi this past weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But that booklet was just one item on her ``to do'' list before
heading back out on the campaign trail this week.
</P>
<P>
   She also briefed Gore campaign surrogates about the details of
the vice president's Medicare plan. And, at least as important
strategically, she helped pull together the information needed to
criticize competing proposals from Gore's rival, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Scary smart?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just scary,'' said Bianchi, with a quick laugh that punctuates
much of a conversation with her. It is an easy, natural laugh, not
at all in keeping with her constant fidgeting, a condition not
uncommon among the sleepless twenty-somethings on presidential
campaigns who are fueled by too many candy bars and Diet Cokes.
</P>
<P>
   The quick nod, the thumbs up, the clenched fist _ they are not
just signals to Gore. They are Bianchi's way of talking about
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my mania,'' she said. ``The vice president knows his
stuff. It's just incredible to me how much detail he knows, about
so many things. I'm just there if he has a question.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, she resembles a cheerleader, nearly jumping in the air
when the vice president responds exceptionally well to a question
at a town hall meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all exciting,'' she explained. ``I know that at some
point, I probably need to get a little more balance in my life. But
this is an unbelievable experience. And it's an honor to work on
issues that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Bianchi's interest in health care policy stems from her
childhood in Atlanta. She often accompanied her mother, Barbara, a
developmental psychologist, on visits to Henry W. Grady Hospital,
where she worked with children on Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Her interest in public service is rooted in the Paideia School.
The progressive private school was founded by children of the
1960s, including her father, Paul, the school's only headmaster, a
Boston native inspired by John F. Kennedy's call to service.
</P>
<P>
   The school made her ``very idealistic,'' she said. When she
wasn't playing basketball for the school team, she was tutoring
low-income children or coaching youth soccer and basketball teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really great growing up in the school community,''
Bianchi said. ``Sometimes I didn't like the idea of my father being
right around the Coke machine at school. But most of the kids
really liked him. And I only had one occasion where my date wanted
to drop me off a few blocks away from the house. He said he didn't
want to get any closer.''
</P>
<P>
   From Paideia, Bianchi went to Harvard University, where she
became friends with Karenna Gore, the vice president's eldest
child. Bianchi spent time enough time with the Gore family that she
became known as ``Sarah B.'' to distinguish her from Sara Gore, one
of Karenna's two sisters.
</P>
<P>
   A standout basketball player _ she once was Georgia High School
Player of the Month _ Bianchi has occasionally shot baskets with
the vice president. And proving that she has learned a lot about
politics, she insists that the vice president always won. ``That's
the right answer,'' she said with that quick laugh of hers.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But, ironically, it was Bill Clinton, not Al Gore, who
originally inspired Bianchi _ or rather, the Kennedyesque call to
service that Clinton incorporated into his campaign for the
presidency in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was telling young people that they could make a
difference,'' she said of Clinton. ``And for the first time in my
life, someone at the national level was talking about things that
resonated with me and with my life.''
</P>
<P>
   After Harvard, then, she became a White House intern. It was
1994, the government was being shut down, and like some many other
volunteers, she was thrown into tasks that she would otherwise
never had a chance to take on.
</P>
<P>
   Her talents were quickly recognized, and when a job came open in
the health care section of the White House Office of Management and
Budget, she was the first choice.
</P>
<P>
   She moved from OMB to the office of Bruce Reed, the director of
the president's Domestic Policy Council, again working on health
care. And in 1998, she moved to the vice president's office,
becoming his chief adviser on health care, eventually shifting over
to the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Klain, Gore's former chief of staff, hired Bianchi
without knowing her personal connections to the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me I could get in on the ground floor,'' she said,
noting the irony.
</P>
<P>
   Bianchi is quick to express the hurt and frustration she felt
over Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a White House
intern at the same time as Bianchi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough and, of course, disappointing,'' she said. ``But
now I find myself hoping that at the end of the day the country
will remember the good things about him, because I do believe he
accomplished a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   But being at the White House during Clinton's impeachment ``also
was a good lesson of staying focused and keeping positive things
coming out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lesson that has guided her through the bleakest times of
the Gore presidential campaign as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned a lot watching the vice president keep going,''
Bianchi said. ``There are a lot of ups and downs and there are a
lot of fair-weather friends in politics. But it's a four-quarter
game, and you've got to stick with your team when they are down.
And you just keep going, if you think you're right on the issues.''

SOME SEE HOPE IN BIOFEEDBACK FOR ATTENTION DISORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By JIM ROBBINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If a child at the Enrico Fermi School in Yonkers, N.Y., is found
to have have attention deficit disorder, parents can choose an
unusual alternative to medication: neurofeedback, a computerized
biofeedback system that some say strengthens the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Vergara, the school's principal, said she was driven to
try the approach when doctors diagnosed the disorder in her son in
1992. ``They told me I needed to give him something to calm him
down,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Vergara decided not to give her son Ritalin, the drug frequently
used to treat the ailment, and instead took him to see Dr. Mary Jo
Sabo, a psychologist in Suffern, N.Y., to try neurofeedback.
</P>
<P>
   Vergara said she saw her son become calmer, and he began doing
his homework without being asked. She and Sabo teamed up to bring
the technique to Fermi, a public elementary school with 900
children.
</P>
<P>
   Now, five years after the program began, nearly 300 children
have been treated at no charge with neurofeedback at Fermi and two
other public schools in Yonkers for a variety of problems,
including ADD, learning disabilities and depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are children who see tremendous gains and some who see
minimal changes,'' said Vergara. ``Over all the kids can focus
better and have better self-esteem. There are fewer suspensions,
better attendance and fewer late kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally relegated to the fringes by mainstream scientists when
it was introduced in the 1970s, brain wave biofeedback _ now called
neurofeedback or neuro-therapy _ has returned. Its effectiveness
boosted by computers, it has made its way into mainstream health
care, largely as a treatment for attention deficit disorder, but
also for depression, head injuries, sleep disorders and other
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that not enough research has been conducted on the
technique to justify any claims for its effectiveness. But that has
not stopped parents of children with ADD from seeking it out,
hoping to avoid or reduce medication for a condition with symptoms
that range from an inability to focus to impulsive outbursts.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hundreds of clinics in the United States offering the
treatment is Connecticut Educational Services in Middletown, Conn.,
which specializes in treating ADD, hyperactivity and traumatic
brain injury. Dr. Robert Reynolds, the psychologist who operates
the clinic, said the technique brought about long-term changes in
the brain's functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``About half the children we treat get off medication
completely,'' Reynolds said. ``The other half reduce their
medication.''
</P>
<P>
   Brain wave training, he said, is part of a package of treatments
that includes family counseling and behavioral therapy. But the
brain wave training, he said, is key.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did all these things without the neuro-feedback and they
didn't work as well,'' Reynolds said. A testing and treatment
package costs around $4,500 at the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that improvements in the patients probably stem from
a placebo response and that parents should be aware that the
technique is highly experimental.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give a child four extra hours a week of one-on-one
attention you'll see some improvement,'' said Dr. Larry Silver, who
has been treating attention deficit disorder in the Washington area
since 1964. ``But will it last a week or a month later? There has
been no follow-up.''
</P>
<P>
   The disorder, Silver said, is ``a neurochemical deficiency.'' He
added: ``And the only thing that will raise the levels of
neurochemicals is medication. We've found no alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Most neurofeedback systems use one or two dime-size sensors
placed on the scalp. The sensors read the subtle electrical
frequencies of the brain. The signal is amplified and displayed on
a computer, and a clinician can see where the client needs to alter
the range of frequencies.
</P>
<P>
   The patients sit at the computer and play Pacman or another
video game. Their success at the game is tied to their ability to
expand the range of their brain waves. After 20 to 40 sessions the
brain changes are set in place, practitioners say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's brain exercise,'' said Dr. Alan Strohmeyer, chief of the
Biofeedback Section of the Department of Neurology at North Shore
University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., and an assistant professor
of neuroscience and neurology at the New York University School of
Medicine. ``There's a direct correlation between neuro-feedback and
getting in shape physically at a gym. Neurofeedback helps the brain
grow and develop normally.''
</P>
<P>
   Neurofeedback is a carryover from the behavioral school of
psychology. In the 1970s, a researcher at the Veterans
Administration Hospital in Sepulveda, Calif., accidentally
discovered that neurofeedback could help some people control
epileptic seizures.
</P>
<P>
   The researcher, Dr. Barry Sterman, now a professor emeritus at
the University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine, had
conditioned cats' brain waves for a sleep study. Coincidentally, he
used some of those cats in a study of the hazards of rocket fuel
for the Defense Department. Most of the cats exposed to the rocket
fuel went into seizures, except those that had received brain wave
training. Sterman then tried the technique on people with epilepsy.
</P>
<P>
   Although it appeared effective, the technique was put aside in
favor of new drugs. Later, Dr. Joel Lubar, a psychologist at the
University of Tennessee, adapted the technique to treat attention
deficit disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Critics agree that there is no evidence to suggest that
neurofeedback is harmful, at least physically. But Dr. Edward
Hallowell, a psychiatrist who teaches at the Harvard Medical
School, has criticized the costs. It is' not that neurofeedback
does not work, said Hallowell, who wrote ``Driven to Distraction:
Recognizing and Coping with Attention Deficit Disorder from
Childhood Through Adulthood.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatment, he said, does work well for some people. He even
refers some patients for the treatment. ``The problem,'' he said,
``is that it's time consuming and it's expensive. Those are real
obstacles.''
</P>
<P>
   A full course of testing and treatment ranges from $1,500 to
$5,000 or more. While some insurance companies pay for the
treatment, most do not.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows precisely how the brain responds to the
neurofeedback training, though recent research on the brain's
ability to change offers some explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Henry Markram, a senior scientist at the Weizmann Institute
of Science in Israel and an expert in neuroplasticity, took his
9-year-old daughter to a psychologist in Toronto who treats ADD
with neurofeedback. ``It was very effective,'' he said. ``I'm very
pleased with the effects.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The brain is incredibly plastic and incredibly responsive,''
Markram said. ``Neurofeedback is in keeping with that.
Neurofeedback could offer a harmless first-line treatment to many
neurological disorders.''

&HT;     FEINSTEIN SCHEDULED FOR LEG SURGERY TUESDAY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., is scheduled to
have surgery Tuesday to repair a shattered bone and ruptured tendon
below the left knee that she suffered during a fall three weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kevin Stone, a sports medicine specialist, is scheduled to
repair Feinstein's patellar tendon and fractured left tibia. The
surgery will be performed at a San Francisco hospital on an
out-patient basis.
</P>
<P>
   The patellar tendon connects the thigh's quadriceps muscle to
the tibia, allowing the knee to straighten.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, 67, has been wearing a flexible cast and alternating
between crutches and a wheelchair since she broke her leg Sept. 3
after falling from the stairs at her family vacation home in Aspen,
Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said she expects to be back on Capitol Hill soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be back next week, I hope,'' Feinstein said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein holds a commanding lead over the Republican candidate
who is trying to unseat her in the Nov. 7 election, according to a
poll released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The survey conducted for the San Francisco Examiner and KTVU
television showed Feinstein favored by 53 percent of those
surveyed, while Rep. Tom Campbell of San Jose trailed with 36
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Suhail Khan, a spokesman for Campbell, wished Feinstein a quick
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``After she is through with surgery, we would like to have a
couple debates,'' Khan said. ``If that needs to be a seated debate
or a debate on radio, we're flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   Khan said Campbell has accepted seven offers to debate
Feinstein, but she has declined them all.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Gantman, spokesman for Feinstein, said the senator
intends to debate Campbell after Congress recesses next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's plenty of time to debate after we get out of
Congress,'' Gantman said.
</P>
<P>
   Stone is a graduate of Harvard College, got his M.D. at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and has lectured
internationally on cartilage and meniscus growth, replacement and
repair.
</P>
<P>
   He is a physician for the U.S. Ski Team, U.S. Pro Ski Tour, the
Lawrence Pech Dance Company, the Marin ballet, and the Old Blues
Rugby Club.

&HT;     OIL OVER TROUBLED WATERS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Of course President Clinton was politically
motivated when he decided to tap into the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve in hopes of reducing soaring energy prices.
</P>
<P>
   And of course Texas Gov. George W. Bush was similarly
politically motivated when he criticized Clinton for setting a
terrible precedent that could lead to an oil shortage in some
future military crisis.
</P>
<P>
   How could it be otherwise? We're in the middle of a presidential
election, for pity's sake. Everything is political, including all
the teeth gnashing about looking political.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue for voters here is whether releasing 30 million
barrels of crude oil, only 5 percent of the reserve inventory, is
good public policy. Vice President Al Gore had urged the move
because skyrocketing home-heating oil costs, combined with rising
prices for vehicle fuel and commercial electricity, increasingly
alarmed voters.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like the federal government, you think such an
interventionist policy amounts to pandering to political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like the oil industry, you view Clinton's decision
as a responsible answer to voters' legitimate pocketbook concerns.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether the limited rush of new oil will
substantially drive down prices because so many supply-and-demand
factors influence the situation. The 30 million barrels is
literally a drop in the bucket in terms of our total consumption.
</P>
<P>
   And the Arab oil countries, meeting this week to discuss pricing
and supply, have a history of putting their own interests ahead of
ours.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's decision should produce some psychological,
diplomatic and practical results. The administration was wise not
to merely sit on its hands and do nothing. At least Clinton and
Gore look as though they realize there's a problem here.
</P>
<P>
   What to do about high oil prices is, predictably, more
complicated than Gore's self-serving attacks on greedy ``big oil''
and Bush's inflammatory scare talk about endangering national
security.
</P>
<P>
   It is not news that as a nation we are too dependent on
low-priced consumption of oil, more than one-half of which is
currently imported from foreign countries. The federal government's
Strategic Petroleum Reserve was established to guard against a
future disruption of oil supplies after the 1973 Arab oil embargo
sent prices spiraling upward and caused shortages at the pumps.
</P>
<P>
   The only previous drawdown was during the 1991 Persian Gulf War,
during the administration of Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   But an overflowing reserve is not sacred, nor is it the only
tool at hand to change our ways.
</P>
<P>
   In all eight federal budget proposals he sent to Congress,
President Reagan whacked away at the SPR to try to save money,
substantially draining its supply. Congress, however, liked the
idea of keeping it filled and ignored Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Although technically the SPR could shelter 700 million barrels,
it currently holds 571 million barrels in salt domes in Louisiana
and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush complains that the Clinton administration has no ``energy
policy.'' But Bush doesn't have one, either, except to demand that
drilling be allowed in the Alaska National Wildlife Reserve. Gore
and environmentalists oppose such a move because of concern that
oil development would destroy the northern ecosystem. Federal tax
beaks for heating-oil customers, truckers, farmers and other heavy
fuel consumers can help on a piecemeal basis. Gore and other
Democrats mostly favor such help, but Republicans resist it.
Republican Vice Presidential candidate Dick Cheney repeatedly voted
against low-income energy assistance when he was in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The oil industry constantly presses Congress for tax breaks to
encourage the development of risky, marginal wells in unexplored
places. Sometimes the industry wins, sometimes it loses.
</P>
<P>
   Other solutions are even more difficult to achieve, such as
forcing conservation through higher taxes and pouring money into
new technology to develop cleaner, more efficient engines,
alternative fuels and smaller automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore and Bush are spending more time indulging in
name-calling than dwelling on the arcane specifics of energy
policies. Gore describes Bush and Cheney, both of whom have made
millions in the energy industry and have received additional
millions in campaign contributions from the industry, as ``in the
pocket'' of big oil.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Cheney charge that Gore is an opportunistic
``flip-flopper'' because he opposed tapping the SPR months ago when
prices seemed stable.
</P>
<P>
   Both charges have some basis in fact. But they do not address
the central problem, which is that as a nation we cannot control
the internal and international market forces that shape our basic
economic needs.
</P>
<P>
   The oil price crisis is hot right now and may well get hotter.
But its impact upon the election depends on what happens in the
coming weeks. If prices continue to rise, Clinton and Gore have
some more scrambling to do.
</P>
<P>
   If prices stabilize, Clinton and Gore can take some credit,
whether they deserve it or not.
</P>
<P>
   And as soon as the election is over, the new administration
ought to get serious about curbing our appetite for oil and finding
new resources. Pricing problems will surely arise again.

REPORT: BIOTECH CORN ISN'T SERIOUS THREAT TO MONARCHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By CAROL KAESUK YOON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a finding that is being hailed by the biotechnology industry
and denounced by environmentalists, the Environmental Protection
Agency has issued a preliminary report concluding that genetically
modified corn is unlikely to pose a serious threat to monarch
butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which was made public last week and focuses on crops
genetically modified to produce an insecticide known as Bt, also
minimized the potential for other environmental problems, including
the persistence of the insecticide in the soil and the evolution of
pests that can withstand it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although there may be individual butterflies that could be
adversely affected, the overall population of monarch butterflies
is not at any risk'' from Bt corn, Brian Steinwand, a spokesman for
the environmental agency, said. But he said the report's
conclusions were tentative and that new data were continuing to
come in. Bt stands for Bacillus thuringiensis, the scientific name
of the bacterium from which the toxin and the gene producing the
toxin originate.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes after more than a year of controversy following
the publication of a Cornell University study showing that
Bt-containing pollen from the genetically modified corn could kill
monarch butterfly caterpillars in the laboratory. That finding
turned the monarch into a symbol of fragile nature threatened by
biotechnology. Opponents criticized the environmental agency for
approving the corn, which was planted on 20 million acres last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The report is a major step in a continuing re-evaluation of the
safety of Bt crops that will culminate in a decision next fall to
discontinue or reapprove their widespread commercial use.
Meanwhile, the report noted, companies are phasing out Bt corn
varieties that produce a particularly toxic pollen _ those that
carry the genetically engineered DNA known as Event 176. The change
could help reduce risks to monarchs and other nonpest insects.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Val Giddings, vice president for food and agriculture at
Biotechnology Industry Organization, which represents companies
that sell seed for genetically modified crops and other biotech
products, praised the report. He called the review rigorous, and
said it confirmed that biotech crops ``pose no adverse health or
environmental problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Jane Rissler, a senior scientist at the Union of
Concerned Scientists, which has been critical of the agency's
handling of Bt crops, said: ``We were disappointed. It's clear that
there are insufficient data.''
</P>
<P>
   Because studies showing actual effects of Bt corn pollen on
monarch butterfly populations in the wild are still in progress,
the report relied instead on indirect studies that, like the
original Cornell research, simply indicate a greater or lesser
likelihood of risk to the monarchs from the pollen. Data considered
include the toxicity of different strains of Bt corn and the
distance that toxic pollen can move within and beyond a cornfield.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to arguing against risks to monarchs, the report
also disputed the significance of other studies that had suggested
the potential for unexpected environmental threats from Bt crops.
For example, some studies have indicated that the Bt toxin from
these plants can persist much longer than had been thought possible
in the soil. Other studies have indicated that pest caterpillars
that have eaten the Bt toxin can sicken the beneficial insect
predators that eat them.
</P>
<P>
   In one of few concessions to critics, the report suggests that
more can be done to prevent the evolution of pests that are
resistant to the Bt toxin. Bt toxin has traditionally been sprayed
on fields by farmers. The arrival of genetically engineered Bt
potatoes, corn and cotton that continually produce Bt in their
tissues raised the possibility that insects would be exposed more
often and for longer periods to the toxin. Such exposure could
speed the evolution of pests that are resistant to the insecticide,
a development that would render Bt useless. Produced naturally by a
bacterium, Bt toxin is an important insecticide for organic farmers
and one of the few available for their use.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next year, Steinwand said the agency would continue to
reassess Bt crops. He said half the new research that the agency
had requested from scientists to assess the potential threat of Bt
corn to monarchs had not yet been submitted to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   In just the last month, he said, the EPA was surprised to learn
from researchers that monarch caterpillars could be found in the
middle of cornfields, the place where most of the toxic pollen from
Bt corn plants ends up landing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That told us, Hey wait a minute,'' said Steinwand. ``We're
still waiting for a considerable amount of data.''

SEARCHING FOR GENES TO SLOW THE HANDS OF TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Calif.)  (See also SCI-DIET-AGING) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ ``Research is a very circuitous road. It
requires tremendous patience and tolerance for failure. That's
something you don't find out about yourself till you actually do
it. It's depressing to put so much time and effort into something
and have nothing to show for it.''
</P>
<P>
   So says Leonard Guarente, a professor of biology at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies the genes that
control aging. But this connoisseur of failure has recently been
enjoying a string of successes in a long intractable field of
research.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after a nine-year pursuit, he reported a finding that
may explain exactly how very low calorie diets _ the one
intervention known to prolong life in experimental organisms _ may
achieve that end.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery, though made in yeast cells, could have broad
consequences should it prove true of people too, because it
identifies a cellular pathway _ and possible drug target _ by which
caloric restriction works. Actuaries, put down your gloomy
mortality tables and sharpen your pencils! Heirs and legatees,
contain yourselves in patience! If any such drug were to work in
humans the same way that this diet of 30 percent less than normal
calories works in laboratory rodents, people would start enjoying a
maximum life span of 170 years, most of it in perfect health.
</P>
<P>
   Guarente's startling insight into caloric restriction was gained
by taking a large though well-calculated career risk. Growing up in
Revere, Mass., he preferred physics and chemistry in school to
biology, which seemed purely descriptive, and to this day the
biology questions in Jeopardy are his weakest subject. But the buzz
about molecular biology in his freshman dormitory at MIT piqued his
interest.
</P>
<P>
   He trained under two well-known Harvard biologists, Jon Beckwith
and Mark Ptashne, and after setting up his own lab at MIT in 1981,
he became over the next nine years an expert in gene transcription,
the mechanism whereby cells make working copies of the genes on
their chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of staying in this safe and mainstream field, he
started looking around for some riskier subject, one where if he
could make any headway at all he would have an impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I got tenure, for four or five years I batted around
some ideas, one of which was learning and memory,'' Guarente said.
But the memory process looked difficult and it seemed to him there
was a better chance of making progress in aging. ``It's a less
crowded field, partly because it's less clear what to do,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, a decade ago, almost no molecular biologists _
people who study life at the level of genes and molecules _ were
working on aging. The field belonged to evolutionary biologists
whose work in the field consisted largely of thought experiments.
</P>
<P>
   When molecular biologists wish to understand a process, they
look for the genes that may control it. Experiments on aging tend
to take a long time even in mice, which live for two years, so
Guarente chose to look first in yeast for genes that might affect
aging. Yeast is a long way from people in evolutionary terms, but
both are eukaryotes, the order of higher celled organisms, and many
fundamental pathways in human cells were worked out first in yeast.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 two postdoctoral students, Brian Kennedy and Nick
Austriaco, arrived in Guarente's laboratory and embraced his idea
of looking for aging genes. It took them four whole years to find a
strain of yeast that lived longer than others.
</P>
<P>
   The strain's longevity seemed connected with a group of genes
whose role was to shut down other genes. Called the sir2, sir3 and
sir4 genes (sir standing for silent information regulator), their
protein products formed a complex that usually sat on the tips of
the yeast cell's chromosomes and repressed the activity of certain
genes there. But in the longer lived yeast, the sir complex left
its usual position and migrated to the cell's nucleus, to a
subcompartment called the nucleolus where the ribosomes, the cell's
protein-making factories, are assembled.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997 Guarente's group had established a principal mechanism
of aging in yeast: The nucleolus sooner or later gets clogged up
with waste circles of ribosomal material until it can no longer
produce ribosomes and the yeast cell dies. The arrival of the sir
complex in the longer-lived yeast strain repressed the genes from
which the circles were generated and delayed aging.
</P>
<P>
   That might explain longevity in yeast, but what about people? At
this point an intriguing but diversionary hint turned up with the
discovery of the human gene for a striking hereditary disease known
as Werner's syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Werner's patients generally die in their teens with symptoms of
old age such as gray hair, wrinkled skin and cataracts. All these
defects are caused by the malfunction of a single gene, a
house-keeping gene known as a helicase because it helps the cell
unwind the double helix of DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Yeast cells possess a helicase-making gene with a similar
structure to the human gene. Guarente and his colleagues showed
that when the yeast helicase gene is disrupted, the yeast cells
become more sensitive to the waste circles and age prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   But just as everything seemed to be hanging together for
establishing a universal mechanism of aging, two of the elements
fell apart. No waste circles could be seen building up in the
nucleolus of animal cells. And the yeast counterpart to the
Werner's syndrome gene does not seem to be central to aging because
adding extra copies of it does not enhance life span.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Guarente felt sure that the silencing of genes was
a profound enough process that it was likely to tie in somehow with
the equally profound process of aging, and that in higher organisms
the failure of silencing might lead to some less visible damage
than the waste circle build-up seen in yeast.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Probing the role of the sir genes he found that one of them,
sir2, seemed more directly involved than the others in determining
the yeast cell's life span. If he disrupted the sir2 gene, the
yeast cells led short lives; if he inserted an extra copy of sir2,
they lived longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we had developed the idea that sir2 was of primary
importance, we wanted to know exactly what it does,'' Guarente
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists have shown that the chromatin, the material
that clads and controls the DNA, carries many small chemical groups
known as acetyl groups when the genes are active, but that when the
acetyl groups are shaved away, the chromatin binds the DNA more
tightly. The underlying genes are then silenced because the cell's
gene-copying machinery cannot access them.
</P>
<P>
   Many researchers had assumed that sir2 was likely to perform its
gene-silencing role by stripping acetyl groups off the chromatin.
But in test-tube experiments sir2 showed no sign of doing that.
</P>
<P>
   Another scientist had noticed that sir2 can sometimes add a
certain chemical group to proteins. To see if it might be doing the
same to chromatin, Guarente and a postdoctoral student, Shinichiro
Imai, wondered if sir2 might be adding this chemical to chromatin,
rather than removing acetyl groups. They mixed the yeast sir2
protein with the chromatin material and with NAD, which would
generate the chemical group to be added. NAD is a substance well
known to biochemists because of its central role in the cell's
energy production through the breakdown of glucose.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment did not go according to plan. The chromatin
material, far from having chemical groups added to it, emerged
lighter than before, and the difference in weight corresponded
exactly to acetyl groups being removed.
</P>
<P>
   Guarente and Imai had discovered, by lucky accident, that sir2
does indeed remove acetyl groups from chromatin, but only in the
presence of NAD. This role had escaped detection previously because
there was no reason to assume that sir2 required NAD as a
co-factor.
</P>
<P>
   This finding, made last year, suggested to Guarente that there
might be a deep link between energy metabolism and gene silencing,
the link being made through sir2. When food is plentiful, most of
the cell's NAD is locked up in metabolizing glucose; the sir2
protein is in passive mode, because it has little NAD to work with,
and the cell or organism, with its genes fully active, burns the
candle of life at both ends. But when glucose supplies are low, NAD
is plentiful, and the sir2 protein can silence genes up and down
the chromosome, seeing that all genes the cell does not need remain
switched off. Such a mechanism would have a distinct evolutionary
advantage: It would enable the organism to postpone reproduction
when food was scarce, living longer to reproduce when conditions
later improved. Animals on a calorically restricted diet are
usually healthy in every respect save that their fertility is
reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The sir2-NAD interaction at the cellular level would explain in
large part how a calorically restricted diet prolongs life span. In
yeast, an active sir2 would silence the genes that generate the
waste circles; in animals, it would maintain the integrity of the
cell. As gene silencing becomes looser with age, Guarente supposes,
many genes that should stay turned off in a cell become active,
degrading cellular function throughout the body.
</P>
<P>
   To test these ideas, Guarente turned again to yeast. Last week
he and two postdoctoral students, Su-Ju Lin and Pierre-Antoine
Defossez, reported that yeast cells kept on a low glucose, low
calorie diet indeed live longer than normal, just as do rats and
mice. The response was abolished both in yeast strains whose sir2
gene had disrupted, and in those whose principal gene for making
NAD had been destroyed, establishing that both genes are necessary
to mediate the effect between diet and longevity.
</P>
<P>
   Guarente is now looking to see if the same is true in the
laboratory roundworm and in mice. ``If this is general I think it
is profoundly significant,'' he says. The reason is that by
developing drugs that mimic the effect of NAD on sir2, people in
principle might at one stroke gain the health and longevity
benefits of a calorically restricted diet, which in practice few
people could adhere to.
</P>
<P>
   Evolutionary biologists believe, on largely theoretical grounds,
that many genes govern aging and that there can be no single
mechanism of aging, whether the one Guarente suggests or any other.
``Even though I think Guarente's whole set of prejudices is wrong,
I think it is relatively harmless for him to bash away at it,'' is
the faint praise he gets from one evolutionary biologist, Dr.
Michael Rose of the University of California at Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   Guarente respects evolutionary theory but believes that
questions about aging can now be settled by experiment. His
particular ideas about aging are too new to have become gospel but
many of his molecular biology colleagues have confidence in what he
is doing. ``He thinks very clearly and sees to the heart of a
problem,'' said Dr. Cynthia Kenyon, who studies aging in roundworms
at the University of California, San Francisco. Ptashne, Guarente's
post-doctoral adviser who now works at the Memorial Sloan Kettering
Cancer Center in Manhattan, praises his ability to join formal
analysis with imaginative approaches.
</P>
<P>
   There are doubtless many more failures to savor before piercing
all the veils of the aging process. But Guarente has seized one end
of a highly interesting thread and is tugging with gusto to see
where it may lead. ``Although it seems unlikely that any drastic
extension in life span is imminent,'' he wrote in a recent article,
``a therapeutic that compresses the period of morbidity may be more
than a flight of fancy.''

&HT;     NINERS TOP THE COWBOYS IN A RAUCOUS GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KEVIN LYNCH  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The San Francisco 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys showed
up for a football game, and a WWF match broke out.
</P>
<P>
   In a game that could only appeal to the lowest common
denominator, the 49ers thrashed the Cowboys, 41-24, on Sunday. But
no one will remember for long the score or that the 49ers recorded
their first win of the season.
</P>
<P>
   They will talk about Terrell Owens' classless touchdown
celebrations, Jerry Rice's sideline screaming fit and the ejection
of Cowboys safety Darren Woodson.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in all these antics was running back Charlie Garner romping
for a franchise-record 201 yards rushing and Jeff Garcia's best
game as a Niner with four touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   The WWF circus began when Owens bolted out of the end zone after
clutching Garcia's second-quarter scoring pass. Both sidelines and
the crowd of 64,127 watched with intrigue as Owens stopped at
midfield, stationed himself on the Cowboys star, opened his arms
and looked at the heavens through the hole in the Texas Stadium
roof.
</P>
<P>
   The aghast crowd rained boos down upon Owens. The Cowboys
offense responded right away with a three-play drive culminated by
Emmitt Smith's 1-yard scoring run. Smith then promptly went to the
star, slammed the football down the turf and jawed at the 49ers'
bench while the crowd went into hysterics.
</P>
<P>
   Owens was bent on making a statement back to Smith and the
Cowboys. He did, right after a 1-yard touchdown reception in the
fourth quarter, with the game out of reach. Owens again charged
toward the star, but this time with defensive back George Teague
following him. Owens slammed down the ball just like Smith and then
was broadsided by Teague.
</P>
<P>
   Tackle Derrick Deese tried to knock the stuffing out of Teague
but missed. Owens quickly got up, grabbed the ball and once again
posed on the star. Rice couldn't believe his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `We're getting ready to start a riot,''' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, both benches stayed calm, and coach Steve Mariucci
called his players around him on the sidelines to tell them to
knock it off. Several people, including chaplain Earl Smith,
defensive tackle Brentson Buckner and receivers coach George
Stewart, tried to calm things down.
</P>
<P>
   Owens' display became a topic of discussion in the postgame
locker room too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that wasn't called for,'' defensive tackle
Bryant Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone on the team took exception to Owens' behavior,
from the owner to the right guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the way we've done it in the past,'' team vice
president John York said. ``That's not the way we do it now, and
it's not the way we'll do it in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens was unapologetic and said he'd ``definitely'' do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't regret what I was doing,'' Owens said. ``I told (my
teammates), `Hey, that's the type of player I am. I'm going to play
with a lot of aggression and I'm going to play with a lot of
emotions.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yet his teammates have to deal with the fallout, which includes
cheap shots from a jaded opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope it doesn't happen again, because it makes him, in
a lot of ways, a marked man,'' 15-year guard Ray Brown said. ``All
these guys have pride in this league and try not to show anybody
up. And if you do, you keep it amongst yourself and that individual
you're talking to. You don't put it up in front of 60,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens was ushered off the field by four beefy security guards as
time ticked off, and the crowd that remained roundly booed him. The
displeasure of tens of thousands and most of his teammates didn't
seem to deter Owens, who talked as if he were proud of his
showmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Mariucci) told me to handle it with class and that's the
thing I should do,'' Owens said. ``I should go into the end zone
and act like I've been there, but you know, I'm my own person. I
bring my own emotions to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens is certainly emotional. After last week's loss to the
Rams, he cried. But some believe Owens must contain himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to think about things before we do them,''
linebacker Ken Norton said. ``I think there's no question that was
uncalled for. ... I don't think something like this will happen
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Deese, who ran after Teague, wasn't in favor of Owens'
taunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter if what T.O. did was right or wrong, to try and
level a guy who's not looking is wrong,'' Deese said. ``Any guy on
my team, I'm going to protect.''
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if Mariucci needed protection from Rice during the
receiver's second-quarter fit. Rice yelled at his coach after
dropping a short pass from Garcia near the sidelines. There's
precedent for this behavior. Rice bellowed at Mariucci during a
1998 blowout win over the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were simply having a friendly dialogue on how we wanted to
approach the next series,'' Mariucci quipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a little emotional on the sidelines,'' Rice sheepishly
admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Control was hardly the order of the day, particularly after
Owens' taunting displays. The Cowboys' Woodson thought center
Jeremy Newberry stepped on him on purpose after a pileup near the
49ers goal line. Woodson went bonkers, yelling at officials,
kicking the football and then winging his helmet, which prompted
his ejection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody pushed me from behind,'' Newberry explained, ``and
Woodson was right in front of me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just one of several emotional fires that broke out
throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to learn how to win,'' Mariucci said. ``And we've
got to learn how to win with some class and as professionals, and
we talked about that.''

CASE OF THE BUBBLE THAT WAS MISTAKEN FOR A SNAPPING SHRIMP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Wash.)   (The Science Times)  
 By KENNETH CHANG    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   How does a snapping shrimp snap?
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, biologists thought they had a simple
explanation. Each snapping shrimp has one oversized claw that cocks
open while a muscle inside the claw pulls taut like the spring of a
mousetrap. Then, suddenly, the claw snaps shut in less than a
thousandth of a second. The impact of shell hitting shell, the
simple explanation went, produced the loud snap.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. The answer, it turns out, is bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, scientists have discovered that in the ocean, what
meets the ear is not always what first meets the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, scientists found that most of the noise in water
pelted by raindrops is not the sound of the raindrops hitting the
water but rather vibrations of microscopic bubbles created by the
impacts. Earlier this year, researchers reported that even
snowflakes falling on water created shrieking bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   In videotapes of snapping shrimp, Dr. Barbara Schmitz, a
professor of zoology at the Technical University of Munich, noticed
a couple of frames showing a bubble near the shrimp's claw as it
snapped shut.
</P>
<P>
   She later attended a talk about sonoluminescence, a phenomenon
in which imploding underwater bubbles heat trapped air to 25,000
degrees and emit flashes of light.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, she mentioned her shrimp and the bubbles she had seen
to the speaker, Dr. Detlef Lohse, a professor of physics at the
University of Twente in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had long discussions afterward during dinner,'' Schmitz
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard the bubble had been seen,'' Lohse recalled, ``I
immediately associated the sound with the collapse of the bubble.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, although Schmitz's high-speed video camera
snapped 1,000 frames a second, already more than 30 times as fast
as a usual movie camera, it was still not fast enough to see what
was happening.
</P>
<P>
   Lohse brought the shrimp _ a species known as Alpheus
heterochaelis that is found along the Atlantic coast of North and
South America _ back to his physics laboratory and videotaped them
with a camera that takes 40,500 frames a second.
</P>
<P>
   The ultra-high-speed photography shows the claw snapping shut in
0.65 milliseconds and squirting out a jet of water traveling at 65
mph. ``It's as fast as a car on an American highway,'' Lohse said.
</P>
<P>
   Because faster-traveling fluids exert less pressure than slower
ones, microscopic air bubbles in the water expand from a few
millionths of an inch across to an eighth of an inch in size as the
jet shoots out of the claw.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the jet slows, the water pressure increases , and the
bubble collapses within a millisecond, producing the snapping
sound.
</P>
<P>
   Lohse said he planned to see if the collapsing bubble also
produced a flash of light.
</P>
<P>
   The original explanation, that the snapping sound comes from the
impact of the two sides of the claw banging together, fails
entirely. In the sound recordings, ``there is no single hint that
you can also hear the closure of the claw itself,'' Lohse said.
``We can't detect it.''
</P>
<P>
   The results, described by Lohse, Schmitz and their colleagues in
the current issue of the journal Nature, amazed both biologists and
physicists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always assumed, like everyone else, it was the claw coming
down,'' said Roy E. Ritzmann, a professor of biology at Case
Western Reserve University in Cleveland, who in the 1970s described
how the shrimp's fast-closing claw mechanism worked.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lawrence Crum, who performed the research on the raindrop
microbubbles in 1989, described the shrimp findings as
``fantastic,'' saying the study explained how the small crustaceans
produced such a loud sound.
</P>
<P>
   Colonies of snapping shrimp often produce enough racket to
thwart ship and submarine sonar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things I wish I had done,'' said Crum, a
principal physicist at the applied physics laboratory at the
University of Washington in Seattle. ``When you see it, it's a
simple obvious result.''
</P>
<P>
   For the shrimp, the snapping noise is of no use _ they have no
ears and cannot hear _ but it might help get them dinner. To hunt,
a snapping shrimp moves within a couple of millimeters from a small
crab, worm or fish and squirts a jet of water. The energy released
by the collapsing bubble probably helps stun or kill the prey.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know,'' said Dr. Deforest Mellon, a professor of
biology at the University of Virginia, ``it's the first time
cavitation has been seized upon by an animal as a offensive or
defensive weapon.''

US MEN'S SOCCER TEAM FINALLY MAKES IT TO SYDNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Chris Albright was standing in the food line at the
athletes' village when it finally struck him that he was at the
Olympics. ``I was getting pasta next to (Dutch golden girl) Inge de
Bruijn,'' he said. ``I mean, that'll do it to you.''
</P>
<P>
   For the best part of a fortnight, these Games were a rumor to
the US men's soccer team. They played their matches in Canberra and
Melbourne and Adelaide, they went back to their hotel, they
switched on the TV, and they watched the swimming and the softball
just like the folks back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept talking about, `If we make the semifinals we're going
to make Sydney, and then THAT'S the Olympics,' '' said Albright,
whose teammates take on Spain here Tuesday night. ``But we all kind
of kidded ourselves. We never would have thought the semis (were
possible).''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Americans first turned up in Paris in 1924, they'd
never survived the first round. Last time in Atlanta, they were
three-and-out without ever seeing Peachtree Street. This time, no
matter what happens against the favored Spanish, the US is
guaranteed to play for a medal here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done something that hasn't been done before,'' said
assistant coach John Ellinger. ``We've made it to the semifinals of
a major men's tournament in a world FIFA event. And even though it
is age-specific (under-23), we are still pretty excited about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that it was a breeze. After tying the Czech Republic and
Cameroon, the Yanks had to beat Kuwait in their group finale to
advance. Then they had to come from behind on a 90th-minute penalty
kick and beat Japan on penalty kicks to get here. ``It was
definitely a surreal moment,'' said midfielder Pete Vagenas, who
drilled home the PK that got his mates into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the Games were just another soccer tournament.
Canberra could have been Hershey, Pa., for all the Americans knew.
``It was a little shock when we first got to Canberra,'' said
midfielder Ben Olsen. ``It was like, what do you mean, there's no
one else here? It was just soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no Uzbek wrestlers, no Danish sailors, no Cuban
boxers. The Americans played their first match while the torch was
still somewhere out in the country with the wallabies and
kookaburras. They couldn't march in the opening ceremonies because
they had a match the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not being able to march and being so far away from the buzz of
Sydney was disappointing,'' said defender Danny Califf. ``But I
think it was good for us also, because it really gave us a chance
to focus completely on our games. There were no outside
distractions, there wasn't that much press, there weren't that many
other things going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the team went to Melbourne and played in the mammoth
Cricket Ground, it got the Big Event taste. ``The last game in
Adelaide, it really hit me,'' said Olsen. ``It was a great venue, a
wonderful stadium, packed, playing against Japan, a fantastic team.
It really set in then that we're in the Olympics and this is pretty
big time.''
</P>
<P>
   Every other time, Adelaide would have been the end of the road,
just as Washington was last time and Zaragoza was in 1992 and Taegu
was in 1988 and Palo Alto was in 1984. But this time, and this
team, were different.
</P>
<P>
   This may be an under-23 squad (with three over-age players), but
it's no longer the tossed-together bunch of collegians and amateurs
that fell short at other Games.
</P>
<P>
   Every player but one (Conor Casey of the University of Portland)
is a pro, either with an MLS team (like Albright, Olsen, and
Califf) or a top European club. Landon Donovan and Frankie Hejduk
play for Germany's Bayer Leverkusen, John O'Brien for Holland's
Ajax, Brad Friedel for England's Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in, all pros, and they know how to act and they know
how to focus and how to get the little things out of their minds
and prepare for a game,'' said Ellinger.
</P>
<P>
   Which means the US is finally on the same footing at Olympus as
their global rivals are. Amateur hour is over _ and the Americans
are in the final four. ``The win the other night was maybe one of
the biggest in US soccer history,'' said Albright. ``I think the
world is opening their eyes a little bit. Another win would
certainly do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not? The people who were supposed to be playing this week _
the Brazilians, the Italians, the defending champion Nigerians _
had packed and left the Olympic village by the time the Americans
checked in Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a great facility,'' marveled Califf. ``The arcade,
the Internet places, everything was really cool. It was like, wow,
it's really happening. We aren't here for just a soccer tournament
_ it's a lot bigger.''

 &HT;    Bitter fight over details of Holocaust
 &HT;    By Jim Galloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before sunrise on a cold March morning in 1970, a
rabbi and an architect slipped over the fence to Greenwood Cemetery
in Atlanta to scout out a burial site for four bars of soap.
</P>
<P>
   A hasty funeral service was conducted later that afternoon _
Jewish law required quick interment for the green-gray cakes, which
had surfaced days before. About 35 people, most of them survivors
of European concentration camps, gathered around a small hole dug
at the base of the local Holocaust memorial.
</P>
<P>
   None had any doubt that the soap bars were made from human
beings.
</P>
<P>
   The architect, Ben Hirsch, devoted a chapter to the incident in
a memoir published this spring and urged scholars to take a closer
look at the topic.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum has barred
Hirsch from conducting a book-signing on its premises in
Washington. Emory University professor Deborah Lipstadt, who
triumphed over a Holocaust denier in a British libel trial this
year, endorses the decision.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, the Nazis killed millions through gassing
and starvation, torture and firing squads. They conducted bizarre
human experiments, harvested hair and gold fillings, and used human
skin for lampshades. But there's no proof that Nazis made soap of
their victims, museum officials said, and the institution won't
endorse any book that argues otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Hirsch) was advocating that we explore what is essentially a
dead end,'' said Peter Black, chief historian at the Holocaust
museum.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has become a bone of contention between scholars and
the dwindling number of Holocaust survivors, who now watch a
post-World War II generation take control of their story. ``I think
I've piqued the fraternity,'' said Hirsch, 68, who still designs
churches and synagogues in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But more than a generational rift is at work. The making of soap
from murdered humans has long served as a particularly horrific
example of the Final Solution's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something that symbolizes the ultimate horror of using
every molecule of the murdered,'' conceded Black, the museum
historian. Survivors are loathe to see that symbol reduced to a
60-year-old rumor.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors wonder whether, in an effort to secure the historical
record against those who argue that the Holocaust never happened,
scholars have set a standard for proof that is too high _ and have
unilaterally cut off the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a religious issue here,'' Hirsch said. ``These are not
just bars of soap. They were buried as if they were human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   And that indeed raises the uncomfortable question of what lies
in the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Holocaust museum in Washington emphasize that
they are not censoring Hirsch or any other survivor. ``Hearing a
Different Drummer'' (Mercer University Press) remains on the
shelves of the museum's bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   But a book signing would be interpreted as a sanctioning of
Hirsch's views, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch had timed the signing to coincide with a November reunion
of Jewish children who were sheltered from the Nazis by a French
network. Hirsch was one of them. His parents and two siblings died
in the camps. Most of ``Different Drummer'' is devoted to Hirsch's
experience as a U.S. soldier in post-war Germany. But in the 10
pages of Chapter 23, he expresses his disappointment in the verdict
of historians on Nazi soap-making. He cites the example of his
uncle, a chemist who was forced to work in Auschwitz making soap.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch says his uncle, who died in the 1950s, confessed to
Hirsch's brother that he had saved his own life by using human
corpses _ something that historians say never happened.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch also tells the story of the four bars of soap in Atlanta.
They were found by a Jewish soldier who was part of a U.S. force
that liberated a concentration camp near Stettin, Germany, near
Frankfurt. The soldier saw the soap cakes, which had been stamped
``RIF.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians say the initials stand for ``Reich Industrie Fett,''
or Reich Industrial Fat. But at the time, the ``I'' was widely
interpreted as a ``J'', and the initials for ``Reines Juden Fett
``_ or Pure Jewish Fat.
</P>
<P>
   The soldier stuffed the soap bars in a bag and took them home.
He eventually married a concentration camp survivor. Twenty-five
years later, the couple was living in Atlanta. The soap bars were
stashed in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   One night, the husband came home from work and found that his
wife, having run out of detergent, was using the soap on the
laundry. As he explained what they were, they both became highly
disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 a.m., the distressed couple called Rabbi Emanuel Feldman of
nearby Congregation Beth Jacob, who consulted rabbinical scholars
in New York and Israel, then set the burial service in motion.
Feldman accompanied Hirsch to the cemetery on that early morning in
1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (the soap bars) would be buried if they were
found today,'' said Lipstadt, the Emory historian. She is a member
of the Washington museum's executive council.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with scholarly research of the Holocaust has been
the seamless manner in which World War II flowed into the Cold War.
The dropping of the Iron Curtain sealed away many of the facts from
the first generation of Holocaust scholars.
</P>
<P>
   But a great rush of information has come in the last few decades
with the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, site of some of
the worst Nazi atrocities, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in the newly opened archives has shed any light on the
topic of making soap from Jews, historians say. ``We haven't found
anything yet that would give us something to grasp onto, that we
didn't have in 1945,'' said Peter Black, the Holocaust museum
historian.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington museum now has a standardized summary that is
faxed to those who inquire about Nazi soap-making. Included on the
fact sheet:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The soap rumor seems to have been first mentioned in the
United States media in 1942.''
</P>
<P>
   _ A recipe for soap in German, dated February 1944, was found
tacked to a piece of plywood at the Danzig Anatomical Institute in
Poland. The recipe calls for fat, but does not refer to human fat,
the museum says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Raul Hilberg, the dean of Holocaust historians, has cited the
testimony of the postwar mayor of Danzig, who said 350 bodies were
found at the plant, along with a cauldron containing the remains of
boiled human flesh. But Hilberg failed to verify the authenticity
of the testimony, the museum statement says.
</P>
<P>
   _ The testimony of two British POWs who labored at the same
plant ``is contradictory and inconclusive,'' the museum says.
</P>
<P>
   What historians say they lack are bills of laden, evidence of a
manufacturing plant or receipts of purchase or exchange _
documentation the Nazis carefully maintained for other noxious
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at all the evidence available about Nazis
experimenting with human beings . . . the composite of all that
evidence cannot permit you to conclude that this happened,'' said
Black. He compares the soap-making stories with the myth of
Hitler's Jewish ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   But survivors think historians may be too strict in their
criteria, citing the museum's statement that ``There is absolutely
no evidence to indicate this was ever done on an industrial basis
or in a centrally directed fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there was no mass production,'' agreed Morris Spitzer,
77. ``But yes, there was production in smaller quantities at many
of the (extermination) camps.'' Spitzer, a camp survivor and
resident of the Bronx, N.Y., is trying to obtain recognition for a
photograph of a 1946 funeral procession in Sighet, Romania,
involving bars of soap collected by the village. Holocaust history
is constantly being adjusted as new evidence and research surface.
</P>
<P>
   Hilberg, the eminent historian, has recommended that the number
of European Jews killed by the Nazi machine be revised downward,
from 6 million to 5.1 million. And even that number now may be
nudged slightly up _ based on even fresher information coming out
of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Such revisions, while common enough in other historical fields,
are handled with extreme care, with the expectation that Holocaust
deniers will twist any change in the record into a retreat from the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   But Lipstadt, the Emory professor and author, said deniers
aren't driving the standards of historians. ``If deniers are a
concern, they are down at the bottom,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the top is a desire for rock-solid historical accuracy.
``It's important because you don't want people to say it's
demi-fiction,'' Lipstadt said.
</P>
<P>
   Soap-making has been a handy metaphor for Nazi cruelty, she
said, but its disappearance from the resume of Nazis atrocities
shouldn't make much difference. ``The truth that we know is bad
enough. We don't need the soap,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If Lipstadt has a regret, it might be that the matter might have
been handled more diplomatically. Early in her career, she stated
categorically that soap-making by the Nazis never happened. If she
had it to do again, Lipstadt said, ``I wouldn't say (the Nazis)
never did it. I would say we have no evidence.'' She would leave
the door slightly cracked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they dug up those bars of soap and DNA tests showed they
were made from human beings, I would say, Oh, my God, we need to
take another look at this,'' Lipstadt said.
</P>
<P>
   But science is an unlikely arbiter when it comes to what is
buried in Atlanta's Greenwood Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   The Holocaust museum says it has tested some bars of soap for
human DNA and found nothing.
</P>
<P>
   But even if human DNA were found in the suspect soap, it
probably wouldn't prove anything, according to Connie Kolman of the
C.A. Pound Human Identification Laboratory in Gainesville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A specialist in tracing ancient DNA, Kolman said the bars of
soap in Greenwood Cemetery probably do contain some human genetic
material. The problem is one of contamination. Regardless of
whether they were made from humans, human beings were involved in
the production.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has touched the cakes has left minute DNA material on
them, including the housewife, the scientist said.
</P>
<P>
   A DNA test could not distinguish between the genetic material
left by the casual handler, Kolman said, and material left by a
human ingredient. ``It'd be nice if science could provide an answer
for this, but right now there's no way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That limitation doesn't upset everyone. Rabbi Feldman, who
conducted the Atlanta burial service for the bars of soap in 1970,
was recently contacted in Israel via e-mail.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A chilly rainstorm will depart from the Middle Atlantic coast on
Tuesday afternoon, bringing an end to showers in Virginia and
Maryland by midafternoon, but a soaking rain will persist until
evening from New York to Boston. It will be uncommonly cold;
daytime readings will average as much as 20 degrees below seasonal
levels.
</P>
<P>
   A ridge of high pressure stretching from the southern Great
Lakes to the Rockies will promote brighter, warmer conditions after
a morning of record chill in the southern Plains. A new push of
polar air into the upper Plains will be accompanied by shifting
winds and isolated showers.
</P>
<P>
   A few showers will return to the Southwest as tropical moisture
streams northward from the Gulf of California. The remainder of the
West will be sunny and warmer.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: ESTIMATING STORMS
</P>
<P>
   Since Saturday, Hurricane Isaac has been roaming through the
remote eastern Atlantic, beyond the usual range of the
reconnaissance aircraft. Its fluctuations in strength have been
estimated entirely by the storm's appearance in satellite images.
By comparing a large number of cases where aircraft measurements of
storm intensity and satellite images were both available, cloud
features in tropical storms and hurricanes have correlated with
their central winds. This pattern recognition technique is the
primary means of determining hurricane and typhoon strength in most
areas of the world.

 &HT;    Bitter fight over details of Holocaust
 &HT;    By Jim Galloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before sunrise on a cold March morning in 1970, a
rabbi and an architect slipped over the fence to Greenwood Cemetery
in Atlanta to scout out a burial site for four bars of soap.
</P>
<P>
   A hasty funeral service was conducted later that afternoon _
Jewish law required quick interment for the green-gray cakes, which
had surfaced days before. About 35 people, most of them survivors
of European concentration camps, gathered around a small hole dug
at the base of the local Holocaust memorial.
</P>
<P>
   None had any doubt that the soap bars were made from human
beings.
</P>
<P>
   The architect, Ben Hirsch, devoted a chapter to the incident in
a memoir published this spring and urged scholars to take a closer
look at the topic.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum has barred
Hirsch from conducting a book-signing on its premises in
Washington. Emory University professor Deborah Lipstadt, who
triumphed over a Holocaust denier in a British libel trial this
year, endorses the decision.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, the Nazis killed millions through gassing
and starvation, torture and firing squads. They conducted bizarre
human experiments, harvested hair and gold fillings, and used human
skin for lampshades. But there's no proof that Nazis made soap of
their victims, museum officials said, and the institution won't
endorse any book that argues otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Hirsch) was advocating that we explore what is essentially a
dead end,'' said Peter Black, chief historian at the Holocaust
museum.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has become a bone of contention between scholars and
the dwindling number of Holocaust survivors, who now watch a
post-World War II generation take control of their story. ``I think
I've piqued the fraternity,'' said Hirsch, 68, who still designs
churches and synagogues in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But more than a generational rift is at work. The making of soap
from murdered humans has long served as a particularly horrific
example of the Final Solution's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something that symbolizes the ultimate horror of using
every molecule of the murdered,'' conceded Black, the museum
historian. Survivors are loathe to see that symbol reduced to a
60-year-old rumor.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors wonder whether, in an effort to secure the historical
record against those who argue that the Holocaust never happened,
scholars have set a standard for proof that is too high _ and have
unilaterally cut off the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a religious issue here,'' Hirsch said. ``These are not
just bars of soap. They were buried as if they were human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   And that indeed raises the uncomfortable question of what lies
in the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Holocaust museum in Washington emphasize that
they are not censoring Hirsch or any other survivor. ``Hearing a
Different Drummer'' (Mercer University Press) remains on the
shelves of the museum's bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   But a book signing would be interpreted as a sanctioning of
Hirsch's views, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch had timed the signing to coincide with a November reunion
of Jewish children who were sheltered from the Nazis by a French
network. Hirsch was one of them. His parents and two siblings died
in the camps. Most of ``Different Drummer'' is devoted to Hirsch's
experience as a U.S. soldier in post-war Germany. But in the 10
pages of Chapter 23, he expresses his disappointment in the verdict
of historians on Nazi soap-making. He cites the example of his
uncle, a chemist who was forced to work in Auschwitz making soap.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch says his uncle, who died in the 1950s, confessed to
Hirsch's brother that he had saved his own life by using human
corpses _ something that historians say never happened.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch also tells the story of the four bars of soap in Atlanta.
They were found by a Jewish soldier who was part of a U.S. force
that liberated a concentration camp near Stettin, Germany, near
Frankfurt. The soldier saw the soap cakes, which had been stamped
``RIF.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians say the initials stand for ``Reich Industrie Fett,''
or Reich Industrial Fat. But at the time, the ``I'' was widely
interpreted as a ``J'', and the initials for ``Reines Juden Fett
``_ or Pure Jewish Fat.
</P>
<P>
   The soldier stuffed the soap bars in a bag and took them home.
He eventually married a concentration camp survivor. Twenty-five
years later, the couple was living in Atlanta. The soap bars were
stashed in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   One night, the husband came home from work and found that his
wife, having run out of detergent, was using the soap on the
laundry. As he explained what they were, they both became highly
disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 a.m., the distressed couple called Rabbi Emanuel Feldman of
nearby Congregation Beth Jacob, who consulted rabbinical scholars
in New York and Israel, then set the burial service in motion.
Feldman accompanied Hirsch to the cemetery on that early morning in
1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (the soap bars) would be buried if they were
found today,'' said Lipstadt, the Emory historian. She is a member
of the Washington museum's executive council.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with scholarly research of the Holocaust has been
the seamless manner in which World War II flowed into the Cold War.
The dropping of the Iron Curtain sealed away many of the facts from
the first generation of Holocaust scholars.
</P>
<P>
   But a great rush of information has come in the last few decades
with the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, site of some of
the worst Nazi atrocities, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in the newly opened archives has shed any light on the
topic of making soap from Jews, historians say. ``We haven't found
anything yet that would give us something to grasp onto, that we
didn't have in 1945,'' said Peter Black, the Holocaust museum
historian.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington museum now has a standardized summary that is
faxed to those who inquire about Nazi soap-making. Included on the
fact sheet:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The soap rumor seems to have been first mentioned in the
United States media in 1942.''
</P>
<P>
   _ A recipe for soap in German, dated February 1944, was found
tacked to a piece of plywood at the Danzig Anatomical Institute in
Poland. The recipe calls for fat, but does not refer to human fat,
the museum says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Raul Hilberg, the dean of Holocaust historians, has cited the
testimony of the postwar mayor of Danzig, who said 350 bodies were
found at the plant, along with a cauldron containing the remains of
boiled human flesh. But Hilberg failed to verify the authenticity
of the testimony, the museum statement says.
</P>
<P>
   _ The testimony of two British POWs who labored at the same
plant ``is contradictory and inconclusive,'' the museum says.
</P>
<P>
   What historians say they lack are bills of laden, evidence of a
manufacturing plant or receipts of purchase or exchange _
documentation the Nazis carefully maintained for other noxious
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at all the evidence available about Nazis
experimenting with human beings . . . the composite of all that
evidence cannot permit you to conclude that this happened,'' said
Black. He compares the soap-making stories with the myth of
Hitler's Jewish ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   But survivors think historians may be too strict in their
criteria, citing the museum's statement that ``There is absolutely
no evidence to indicate this was ever done on an industrial basis
or in a centrally directed fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there was no mass production,'' agreed Morris Spitzer,
77. ``But yes, there was production in smaller quantities at many
of the (extermination) camps.'' Spitzer, a camp survivor and
resident of the Bronx, N.Y., is trying to obtain recognition for a
photograph of a 1946 funeral procession in Sighet, Romania,
involving bars of soap collected by the village. Holocaust history
is constantly being adjusted as new evidence and research surface.
</P>
<P>
   Hilberg, the eminent historian, has recommended that the number
of European Jews killed by the Nazi machine be revised downward,
from 6 million to 5.1 million. And even that number now may be
nudged slightly up _ based on even fresher information coming out
of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Such revisions, while common enough in other historical fields,
are handled with extreme care, with the expectation that Holocaust
deniers will twist any change in the record into a retreat from the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   But Lipstadt, the Emory professor and author, said deniers
aren't driving the standards of historians. ``If deniers are a
concern, they are down at the bottom,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the top is a desire for rock-solid historical accuracy.
``It's important because you don't want people to say it's
demi-fiction,'' Lipstadt said.
</P>
<P>
   Soap-making has been a handy metaphor for Nazi cruelty, she
said, but its disappearance from the resume of Nazis atrocities
shouldn't make much difference. ``The truth that we know is bad
enough. We don't need the soap,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If Lipstadt has a regret, it might be that the matter might have
been handled more diplomatically. Early in her career, she stated
categorically that soap-making by the Nazis never happened. If she
had it to do again, Lipstadt said, ``I wouldn't say (the Nazis)
never did it. I would say we have no evidence.'' She would leave
the door slightly cracked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they dug up those bars of soap and DNA tests showed they
were made from human beings, I would say, Oh, my God, we need to
take another look at this,'' Lipstadt said.
</P>
<P>
   But science is an unlikely arbiter when it comes to what is
buried in Atlanta's Greenwood Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   The Holocaust museum says it has tested some bars of soap for
human DNA and found nothing.
</P>
<P>
   But even if human DNA were found in the suspect soap, it
probably wouldn't prove anything, according to Connie Kolman of the
C.A. Pound Human Identification Laboratory in Gainesville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A specialist in tracing ancient DNA, Kolman said the bars of
soap in Greenwood Cemetery probably do contain some human genetic
material. The problem is one of contamination. Regardless of
whether they were made from humans, human beings were involved in
the production.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has touched the cakes has left minute DNA material on
them, including the housewife, the scientist said.
</P>
<P>
   A DNA test could not distinguish between the genetic material
left by the casual handler, Kolman said, and material left by a
human ingredient. ``It'd be nice if science could provide an answer
for this, but right now there's no way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That limitation doesn't upset everyone. Rabbi Feldman, who
conducted the Atlanta burial service for the bars of soap in 1970,
was recently contacted in Israel via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he favored exhuming the small soap casket, the rabbi
replied, ``Maybe it would be best for it to remain a mystery.''

A PLACE TO TURN WHEN BREAST CANCER STRIKES

   &UR; ``Breast Cancer: The Complete Guide'' (third edition), by Dr.
Yashar Hirshaut and Dr. Peter I. Pressman (Bantam Books, $15.95). &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A diagnosis of breast cancer, and indeed even the possibility
that one has the disease, are sources of enormous stress.
</P>
<P>
   But as the authors of this definitive guidebook point out, there
is positive news about breast cancer: It is now stable at around
180,000 new cases in the United States each year, and the cure rate
is definitely improving.
</P>
<P>
   In this updated edition of a highly regarded resource, the
authors _ a medical oncologist and a surgical oncologist _ provide
both the support and every scrap of the information that a woman
needs to get the right treatment from the right doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The format is carefully organized and readable, covering all the
details of diagnosis, treatment options, follow-up, recurrence and
the social and emotional aspects of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   One especially valuable section demystifies the complicated
system of cancer classification, standards that unfortunately vary
from country to country, region to region and even from medical
center to medical center.
</P>
<P>
   The explanations offered are easily understandable, covering
essentials like the size of tumors, where they are attached, how
doctors arrive at cancer's stages and how one can be assured that a
lump is not cancer but a benign tumor or cyst, as 90 percent of
such growths turn out to be.
</P>
<P>
   The chapters on surgery, which remains the prime defense against
breast cancer, and on radiation are especially detailed, walking
the reader from pretreatment to procedure to aftereffects and
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, the book has no chapter on alternative treatments for
breast cancer. The authors describe that course of treatment as ``a
prescription for tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Research by the authors and others has shown that nontraditional
treatments are not known to work against this disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know everything about the mysterious factors that
govern why it is that one patient survives and another does not
under similar medical circumstances,'' the authors write. ``We do
know that imaging, enemas, macrobiotic diets, relaxation
techniques, deep massage, group healing and the like are not a
substitute for good medical treatment.''

POE HAPPY WITH FAME FRIEND BROUGHT HER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Crossing the International Dateline to get here, Kay
Poe got trapped in a time warp. Every traveler loses a day on the
calendar in the bargain, but Poe has had four months taken away
from her.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than being allowed to devote her attention to the ongoing
Olympic Games, she has been stuck on May 20 and the events of the
goodwill games. On that day, before the US taekwondo trials
featherweight division final in Colorado Springs, the samaritan act
of Poe's Houston stablemate and best friend, Esther Kim _ who
conceded the fight and the Sydney Games berth rather than
capitalizing on the dislocated kneecap Poe had suffered in the
previous bout _ dwarfed everything else about this fledgling
Olympic sport.
</P>
<P>
   Kim and her father, Jin Won Kim _ who coaches his daughter and
Poe _ are here as guests of the International Olympic Committee,
which recognizes how heartwarming, and bankable, the tale is.
</P>
<P>
   Poe understands this, too, and has tried to oblige the nonstop
requests to relive the details of May 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really happy it's had such a positive influence on the
Olympics and general public because there have been so many
negatives (involving Olympic scandals and litigation),'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the story doesn't end there, which only Poe seems to
understand. There is the small matter of her competition on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest,'' she said, ``right now I'm not looking back.
I've got an Olympic event and I'm not looking back until the final
journey.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a journey Poe, 18, began 13 years ago when her parents,
insurance agency owners Ken and Linda Poe, were seeking an outlet
for their daughter, who was, shall we say, a tad hyperactive.
</P>
<P>
   When Kay was 5, recalls Linda, Mom wanted to take a nap and
asked her daughter, ``Will you be all right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Mom,'' promised Kay.
</P>
<P>
   When Linda awoke, she discovered that Kay had been busy
landscaping the back yard, in which a huge hole had been burned
that wasn't there when Linda closed her eyes. Next to the hole was
a hose that Kay apparently had used for some volunteer
firefighting.
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting to waste this new feature, Linda and Ken installed a
little red chair in the hole and sentenced Kay to a half-hour of
quiet reading in it each day.
</P>
<P>
   Two elderly neighbors noticed this routine and eventually asked,
``What did you do to get sent here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ask,'' replied the 5-year-old, rolling her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   She was the type of child, Ken observed, ``that you really
didn't want to have too much free time on her hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Taekwondo proved a therapeutic diversion, and, eventually, Poe
caught fire in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   An international nonentity only two years ago when she lost a
qualifying bout for the Pan American Games, she vaulted to the
world's No. 1 ranking last year and guaranteed the United States a
taekwondo slot in Sydney by winning her division in the world
Olympic qualifying competition at Porec, Croatia, in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to write a book about what's most grueling, it's not
the Olympics, it's the Olympic team trials,'' said Ken Poe. ``It's
one thing to mess up for yourself. It's another thing to mess up
for your entire team. You go home and 50,000 people want to know
what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a fraction of the number who still want to know about the
US trials, which tends to obscure the fact that Poe is a
world-class force, not merely the beneficiary of a gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish she'd (won the trials) outright instead of the way it
happened,'' said Linda Poe, ``so she wouldn't have this hanging
over her.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Kay might find it quite crowded on the mat Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the immediate aftermath of Esther's decision, Jin Won Kim
advised Poe, ``You're going to the Olympics because Esther wants to
bow out. I want you to go and do your best for your country, your
family, your school.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's not company enough, Jin Won Kim says Poe will have
Esther's heart and soul with her during competition. And Poe
contends there's room for more, that this isn't simply the Esther
and Kay Show.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents have been so great to me,'' said Poe. ``My trainer,
Master (Seok) Kim, Esther's dad, my training partner, Simona Hradil
_ it's a shame they've gotten overlooked in all this.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Kim and Poe, one person apparently has resisted the
sentimentality in the wake of the act of charity. Master Choi owns
the Houston studio to which the women transferred when Jin Won Kim
moved his school to suburban Austin, Texas, two years ago. And Poe
credits her international success to one of Choi's trainers, Seok
Kim (no relation).
</P>
<P>
   But there won't be any reunion among the old gang. Poe and
Esther Kim no longer are affiliated with the school. The women
contend that though Choi claims they quit, he actually expelled
them because they didn't give him enough publicity after the
trials.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly free agents, Kim will continue her taekwondo career in
Korea, while Poe is confident she'll find a new base closer to
home.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Choi is about the only person she won't be
fighting for Wednesday.

EVERETT HELPS POWER AMERICAN BASEBALLERS TOWARD GOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ He may yet win Olympic gold. Someday he will no doubt
be a starting shortstop in the major leagues and possibly be the
first American to win a gold medal and a World Series ring.
</P>
<P>
   But in Boston sports lore, he forever will be the key player the
Red Sox surrendered in a deal which brought Jurassic Carl Everett
to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Everett (no relation to the Sox' combustible center
fielder) is the starting shortstop for Tommy Lasorda's no-name gang
that's threatening to win America's first gold in the sport we
invented. Hardball has been a medal event for only eight years and
the mighty Cubans won the first two Olympic tournaments, compiling
a 9-0 record each time.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cubans have shown some vulnerability this go-around,
losing to the Netherlands, 4-2. Cuba beat the United States, 6-1,
Saturday in a game marred by a bench-clearing episode when Cuban
righty Jose Ibar hit American cleanup hitter, Ernie Young. The
Americans and Cubans are both 6-1 as they go into Tuesday's medal
round. The Cubans play Japan Tuesday afternoon and the Americans
play Korea Tuesday night. A US gold-medal game with the Cubans
Wednesday would be the ultimate test for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously they didn't push us around,'' Everett said after
Saturday's loss to the Cubans. ``But you saw the way they play.
They hit our No. 4 hitter and a guy sliding into home plate went
out of his way to get our catcher (Pat Borders was spiked by Cuban
pinch runner Yobal Duenas). It was dirty. Borders was off the plate
by 6 feet. This was definitely a bonding experience for us. It
should get us fired up and get us going.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra was the American shortstop when baseball was
first played as a medal sport at the Olympics in 1992 in Barcelona.
Those Americans failed to earn a medal, losing to Japan in the
bronze-medal game.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Adam Everett is no longer a prize prospect in
the Boston organization because of the looming prescence of Nomar
at short. When Houston dangled the multi-talented Carl Everett last
winter, Red Sox GM Dan Duquette was willing to part with Adam
Everett (along with Greg Miller) because the Sox should be set at
short for another 10 or 12 years if Nomar stays healthy and signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Boston was a good organization for me,'' Adam
Everett said. ``You always want to stay with the team that drafts
you, and they were nice to me there. But I understood the trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett is from Georgia and was playing for the University of
South Carolina when Boston made him its first-round pick in the
June '98 draft. Baseball America ranked him as the best defensive
player in that draft.
</P>
<P>
   He plays a Mark Belanger-type game. Carrying only 156 pounds on
a 6-foot frame, he is never going to hit like Garciaparra. In his
two years in the Sox system, he hit .296 for the Lowell Spinners
and .263 for Trenton before he was dealt to the Astros. Houston
played him at triple-A New Orleans in 2000 and he finished at .246
after a slow start. Too often he falls behind on the count.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't take Lasorda long to recognize Everett's defensive
skills and the 23-year-old Georgian has been plugging the hole at
short and batting in the No. 9 spot in the order for the US. He
made two outstanding stops in a 4-0 win over Korea (``My best game
here so far'') and Saturday started a nifty double play against the
Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   Against Cuba, Lasorda showed confidence in his young shortstop.
Trailing, 5-0, in the seventh, the veteran manager let Everett hit
with with runners on first and third and two out. Everett grounded
to second. When the Americans rallied for their only run in the
ninth, Lasorda opted to pinch hit for his star glove-man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big-league shortstop, without question,'' said the Hall
of Fame former Dodger manager. ``He's outstanding. If he hits, he's
gonna be one helluva ballplayer.''
</P>
<P>
   What does Adam Everett think about his place in Boston sports
history _ the man who was dealt for Carl Everett?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'll ever be able to put up those kinds of
numbers,'' he said humbly.
</P>
<P>
   Then, demonstrating that he's been out of touch with recent
events at Fenway, the young infielder added, ``But it's an honor to
be mentioned in the same sentence as a great player like Carl
Everett.''

E. Vernon Laux is the author of ``Bird News'' (Four Walls Eight
Windows, 1999.  
 By E. VERNON LAUX   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAK BLUFFS, Mass. _ Once in a great while, a natural history
book changes the way people look at the world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1838, John James Audubon's ``Birds of America'' was one, the
first illustrated book of North American birds. In 1934, Roger Tory
Peterson produced ``Field Guide to the Birds,'' the first to use
paintings and drawings to depict living birds as they appear in the
field, with arrows pointing out specific markings.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson's guide stood the publishing world on its head with its
instant and widespread popularity. The Peterson system, as it has
become known, spawned a series of highly useful guides that is
still going strong.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes ``The Sibley Guide to Birds,'' an encyclopedic
illustrated guide to the birds of North America. The book will be
published in October, but birders and ornithologists who have seen
it are already hailing it and its author, David Allen Sibley.
</P>
<P>
   Many people, this writer included, did not see the need for
another guide to North American birds. It shows how wrong one can
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``David has just raised the bar,'' said Pete Dunne, author of
numerous books and director of the New Jersey Audubon Society's
Cape May Bird Observatory. ``This book represents the high-water
mark for bird guides.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon Perkins, field ornithologist for the Massachusetts Audubon
Society, calls the book ``a quantum leap.''
</P>
<P>
   Each species is depicted in a clear and easy to understand way
with multiple illustrations starting with the flying bird from
above and below, a first for any bird guide and a feature that will
be extremely useful to intermediate and advanced birders who often
deal with birds overhead at migratory hot spots along either coast
or inland.
</P>
<P>
   And each species is shown in juvenile, immature, male and female
plumages, both ordinary and breeding, more than other guides
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no subject is ever going to look exactly like the
illustration. A drawing is a composite of the artist's experience
and a photograph is a record of a fleeting instant, a snapshot in
time. Generally, though, paintings and drawings of birds can do
much more than photographs to emphasize field marks. And when the
artist is a master birder, with an eye for detail and tremendous
field experience, the results have a much greater chance of
depicting what it is one may actually see when confronted with a
certain species in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Birds, specifically sketching, drawing and painting them, have
been the central theme for Sibley's life from as far back as he
remembers. He began observing birds when he was 7, and by 12 he was
photographing birds in the hand, sketching birds and had already
amassed an impressive volume of data.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 years ago, he began thinking about producing a
field guide. ``I wanted all plumages, age classes and sexes, of all
species,'' he said. ``I wanted to know and categorize everything
about birds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``David is one of the supreme field birders in the United
States,'' said Dr. Noble S. Proctor, a professor of ornithology at
Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven and an author of
an ornithological textbook.
</P>
<P>
   That skill as a field observer, married with his gifts as an
artist, has given the guide a distinctive, personal feel. Whereas
most field guides are collaborative efforts, this one is the way
Sibley wanted it, envisioned it and shaped it in more than a decade
of work. It is the guide he always wished he could use.
</P>
<P>
   Each species has its common and scientific names as well as its
average measurements, including length, wingspan (also a first for
a North American guide) and weight in both imperial and metric
systems.
</P>
<P>
   But as Sibley points out in his introduction and elsewhere in
the book, birds are highly variable. ``Do not expect any bird to
look exactly like the illustrations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, bird weights are highly variable, a function of the
fantastic migrations that many undertake. Some long-distance
migrants having the ability to almost double their body weight in
some instances, storing subcutaneous fat to be used in long nonstop
flights. A warbler that has just arrived after a night of flying
may weigh far less than an individual that has been feeding for a
few days or longer. Side by side the differences are apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he painted his amazing flight shots, Sibley smiled.
``It is a question that requires a long answer,'' he said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sibley's father, Fred Sibley, is an accomplished and
well-traveled ornithologist who studied California condors in the
late 1960s, later directed the Point Reyes Bird Observatory in
California and then became vertebrate curator at the Peabody Museum
of Natural History at Yale, where he recently retired.
</P>
<P>
   David's older brother, Steve, started listing birds he had
observed, and by age 7, David was taking birds out of mist nets,
fine nets ornithologists use to capture birds without injuring
them, and competing against his older sibling. Sibling rivalry and
an insatiable desire for information spurred him on. He became
proficient at handling live birds by the next year, and he soon
began collecting and organizing information, facts and figures.
</P>
<P>
   At 12, he was taking photographs of birds in the hand with wings
outstretched. He took pictures of the open-winged birds from above
and below, of juveniles, immatures, females and males. He amassed a
file of pictures accompanied by sketches made of birds in flight
that featured pictures of birds displaying features and marks that
only a few accomplished birders knew about.
</P>
<P>
   When the idea came to him about how to organize the species,
depicting each bird with separate paintings for each plumage,
accompanied with notes on behavior or unique field marks,
descriptions of voice, range maps and similar confusing species all
on the same page, so did the idea of the paintings of the flying
birds at the top of each page.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley, 38, and his wife, Joan Walsh, credit Dunne of the Cape
May center and Will Russell, who operates a natural history tour
company called Wings, with enabling him to complete the project.
Dunne hired Sibley as a hawk counter in Cape May, giving him a base
from which to operate. And Russell hired him to conduct birding
tours.
</P>
<P>
   Expert birders who have seen the book call it a must-have guide
for anyone interested in birds.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are a few complaints. Some expert birders say
the book contains, if anything, too much information. And at 9.5
inches long and 2.65 pounds, it is more than some people will want
to carry into the field.
</P>
<P>
   For these and other reasons, Houghton-Mifflin, publishers of the
Peterson guides, need not worry that sales of its volumes will go
into eclipse. In fact, the company itself is coming out with a new
competitor to the Peterson books, ``Birds of North America,'' part
of a new series, the Kaufman Focus Guides, by Kenn Kaufman. It is
notable in that it uses computer-modified photographs to illustrate
each species.
</P>
<P>
   But Sibley's guide ``is far and away the best single book on
North American birds,'' said Denny Abbott, of Stratham, N.H., a
founding member of the American Birding Association.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Petersen, a field ornithologist at Massachusetts Audubon
and vice president of the American Birding Association, said the
book ``once again raised the standard of excellence in a North
American field guide.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sibley Guide's open format, telegraphic field
descriptions, consistency in artistic style and breadth of plumage
coverage combine to give North American birders a guide reminiscent
of those produced in the finest European tradition,'' Petersen
said. ``It's a gem!''

SERENA MANAGES TO OVERCOME SPIRITED SELES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Serena Williams is talking to Billie Jean King and Zina
Garrison, the US Olympic tennis coaches. ``Now you guys realize how
our parents feel when Venus and I have to play each other. Well,
you're our parents here. No fun, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   This was Monday afternoon, just before King and Garrison's
foster kids Venus Williams and Monica Seles collided in the
semifinals for the rights to go for gold.
</P>
<P>
   No fun for this mom-and-mom operation. No cheering from the
sidelines. No loud motivational and inspirationally profound
messages like ``Stay in the moment! Right here! Right here! Now's
your time!'' _ even though it was a terrific match, a no-lose
situation for the US.
</P>
<P>
   King and Garrison were far from the stadium court and the throng
of 10,000 where Venus Williams was . . . well . . . simply,
awesomely, Venus one more time, 6-1, 4-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on strong-armed and dangerous to 6-1, 4-2, she suffered
the inevitable power outage while Seles reached back 10 years to
win thunderbolting duels and five successive games. Reactivating
her generators, Williams zapped to 4-1 in the third, then
short-circuited as Seles almost caught up. OK, time to impersonate
a blast furnace in the stretch, she cooled a reviving Seles with
more high voltage.
</P>
<P>
   Up, 4-3, but lagging at 15-40, Williams unleashed destabilizing
serves _ a hook and a humming 10th ace _ erasing the two break
points that would have brought about a 4-4 clinch. She closed with
a service-cracking, line-splitting backhand return.
</P>
<P>
   That put Williams in Wednesday's gold-medal fandango against a
willowy Russian 18-year-old, Elena Dementieva, she a tormentor of
the Australian populace in a 2-6, 6-4, 6-4, victory over one of the
girlz from this `hood, 17-year-old Jelena Dokic. Metal is still
available for whoever's mettle holds up in a Seles-Dokic playoff
for the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches King and Garrison had exiled themselves from the
apoplectic outdoor exercise of screaming their brains out in
unseasonally cool fresh air to a quiet TV luncheon in the players'
dining room.
</P>
<P>
   It was idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy when you're working with both girls, and you
want the best for both of them,'' she says. ``I remember 1988 in
Seoul, and I played against Pam Shriver. The bronze was at stake,
and how hard it was for both of us, and our coach then, Marty
Riessen. You wonder what's going through his head, if he's told her
something he didn't tell me, and Pam wondering the same. (Garrison
beat Shriver to snare the bronze before they regrouped as doubles
partners, collaborating for gold.)
</P>
<P>
   ``So Billie and I decided we'd just stay away from it
altogether, watch on TV. And Serena was sweet, about the way we'd
feel like their folks. We were very quiet, just eating lunch and
watching the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweating it out wordlessly for both kiddies like the caring
earth mothers these champs are.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly watching? An unnatural act for perpetually effervescent
Billie Jean King. If she ever witnessed a game of tennis in neutral
silence it was because she had laryngitis or swallowed a jalapeno
pepper. This must have been no more difficult for her than Don King
saying, ``No comment'' or Eddie Andelman switching to pantomime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like a short lunch'' _ as the first set consumed
merely 19 minutes. ``You know, just the tunafish sandwich I always
have. But,'' Zina laughs, ``as Monica got back into it, and it went
on into the third set . . . and she had a chance to pull even at
4-4 . . . I think we ate too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Gulp, the perils of remote coaching at table.
</P>
<P>
   King says, ``Z and I were both pleased that it was close,
because you don't want to see either person beaten badly, the way
it started out for Monica. You know, she's lost 20 pounds and is
fitter than she's been in years. Now it will take a while for her
mind to catch up with the physical improvement. Monica's been
around forever, but she's only 26. She could be great again.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very competitive match like that helps our sport, especially
at the Olympics when so many eyes are on every sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is supposed to be fun, and it wasn't fun today.''
</P>
<P>
   King and Garrison couldn't let it all howl out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rooting, pulling for our kids, that's the fun,'' King says.
``Seeing `em come through. We're glad our Venus won her 31st
straight. But we're sad it was at our Monica's expense. That's what
I don't like about the Olympics _ teammates going head-to-head like
that when we've bonded and built a familial team spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it happens in track and swimming. But that's not quite
the same as looking someone in the eye, your teammate, and trying
to knock them out of the competition. That's why I think the format
should be changed to make it all team competition. Men's and
women's doubles and mixed doubles. Plus a mixed team event with the
World Team Tennis format. More medals, more fun. Of course I'm
biased.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as commissioner of World Team Tennis, she is. But, as
probably the sharpest observer of the game from the inside, King is
also right. Alterations are necessary to give Olympic tennis a
distinctive feel and look, a departure from its present appearance
as one more conventional tourney on an overcrowded calendar.
</P>
<P>
   King has the ear of the overall boss, Italy's Francesco Ricci
Bitti, president of the International Tennis Federation, on this
matter. It's to be hoped that he succumbs to her sweet somethings
and carries the bouncing ball of reform for 2004.
</P>
<P>
   After three matches within 24 hours, Williams said she was a
little hard-pressed in keeping two streaks alive: 31 straight
victories in singles, 20 straight in doubles with Serena. Sunday's
saga with Arantxa Sanchez Vicario (3-6, 6-2, 6-4) was a prelude to
the defeat of Seles, followed by the Sisters' 6-3, 6-2, crunching
of the top-seeded French, Amelie Mauresmo and Julie Halard-Decugis
to attain the semis.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm being lazy most of the time, not practicing much, not
doing much,'' Williams says. ``Just conserving myself. I'm pretty
young. My mom says when she was young she didn't get tired, so I
shouldn't get tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Moms King and Garrison are tired of shutting up. But now they
can counsel their kids and shout for them again the rest of the
way, boost Seles for a bronze and the Williams sisters for golds.
Resoundingly. The medals may be golden but, for Billie Jean King,
silence ain't.

   Birth and Death of Stars
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are stars all burning out, or are new ones forming?
</P>
<P>
   A. Stars are being born as well as dying, said Dr. Nolan
Walborn, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in
Baltimore, but the rate varies greatly from galaxy to galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   One mission of the Hubble Space Telescope is to observe
star-formation regions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stars form from huge clouds of dust and gas. If a cloud begins
to contract because of its own gravity, its interior heats up as
gravitational energy is converted to heat energy, reaching millions
of degrees, and nuclear reactions begin that change one element
into another, releasing energy.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure tends to expand the cloud back out, Walborn said,
but eventually equilibrium is reached. ``That is what a star is,''
he said, ``a mass of gas at equilibrium between gravity's inward
pressure and outward pressure from nuclear reactions.''
</P>
<P>
   A star has a finite lifetime because it is burning fuel. For 90
percent of its life, it burns hydrogen into helium. When the
hydrogen is used up, the pressure decreases, but gravity never
disappears, so the star contracts until the temperature climbs
again, this time reaching hundreds of millions of degrees, while
reactions convert helium to carbon and oxygen. The star can then
remain stable for a briefer time. Eventually the star dies, when
the reactions only consume energy but do not produce it.

<P>
   SYDNEY _ Medals or no medals. Monday was not a good day for the
USA.
</P>
<P>
   We won more gold on Day 10 of the 2000 Games, but charges of
Americans cheating filled the Olympic Stadium air like so many
poisonous javelins and shots.
</P>
<P>
   The International Amateur Athletic Federation confirmed that
shot-putter C.J. Hunter, the husband of Marion Jones, tested
positive for banned substances. Meanwhile, Olympic big shots
accused America of going soft on past cheaters, perhaps covering up
their crimes and allowing them to compete in the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Just as a thrilling night of competition started, the Sydney
Morning Herald's PM edition hit the streets with a full page cover
shot of Marion and her controversial husband accompanied by the
headline: ``Marion _ Does She Need This? Drug allegations against
the husband of US track star Marion Jones have cast doubt on her
ability to win a predicted five gold medals.''
</P>
<P>
   So while American Stacy Dragila was en route to the first
women's pole vaulting gold, Craig Masback, executive director of
USA Track and Field, was in the bowels of the stadium, staging an
impromtu, head-scratching press conference in which he admitted,
``The challenge facing Marion Jones is a prohibitive one. This very
real athletic challenge has only been made more challenging by
these events.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impression given by the media is that everyone is doing it
(using banned substances) and an athlete might think they are doing
something wrong if they don't. I'm disgusted by it. I don't think
anyone who cheats should be respected.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in the states we always assume the other guys are the
offenders. Remember those cheatin' East Germans and Chinese
stealing medals from our athletes? Remember Canadian Ben Johnson
denying Carl Lewis his moment in the 100 in Seoul?
</P>
<P>
   Ireland's Michelle Smith? An aging swimmer from a country with
no 50-meter pools shows up in Atlanta in 1996 looking like Rambo
and shreds the competition. She's married to confirmed drug cheat,
Erik de Bruin, which only adds to our suspicion. Sure enough, years
later she tests positive and is tossed from the pool. The husband
was a cheat. The wife was winning too much gold. She must have been
cheating, too. This doesn't bode well for the woman married to C.J.
Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch swimmer Inge de Bruijn was the Michelle Smith of these
games. At 27, she suddenly got better and faster than everyone
else. She was moved to tears by accusations that grew by the hour
with each record-shattering performance. Whisperers said her
protruding jaw was a sign of steroids.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Jones has one gold so far and is on deck for three or
four more. But now she's dealing with a whole new kind of pressure.
She's going to have to perform in the wake of old and new US drug
rumors. The IAAF's statement regarding her husband was only one of
a flurry of charges which tainted the American team.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Arne Ljungqvist, IAAF's anti-doping official, charged
that US track and field chiefs had failed to explain 15 suspicious
drug tests among their athletes in the past two years. Prince
Alexandre de Merode, medical chief of the International Olympic
Committee, Monday said US track and field officials covered up five
positive drug tests before the 1988 Seoul Olympics, then added,
``If it's happening now, I'm really not surprised. It's not the
first time such a problem arises in the US with the national
athletic federation.''
</P>
<P>
   Piling on, IOC athletics commission member Johann Olav Koss
(former Norwegian Olympic speedskating champion) effectively
charged the USOC with a coverup, saying, ``These athletes should
not be protected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the least bit defensive and I welcome a discussion
with Johann Koss,'' countered Masback.
</P>
<P>
   The charges and countercharges were quite confusing. Citing
confidentiality rules, Masback refused to talk about Hunter's
situation. Jones's husband was the 1999 shot put world champion,
finished second at the US trials, but pulled out of Olympic
competition citing a knee injury. He is with Jones in Sydney and
was at the track when she won the 100 meters Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Masback said none of the American athletes in Sydney tested
positive. But now they are all tainted. Inquiring minds want to
know when the US first knew about Hunter's positive test.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Michael Johnson. Ever-overshadowed, he won another gold in
the 400 meters Monday, but was asked if the new charges tarnished
his medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm feeling happy with what I accomplished,'' he
said. ``Call it selfish if you want. I just want to think about my
situation, not worry or deal with what might overshadow that.''
</P>
<P>
   American Alvin Harrison, who copped the silver in the 400, said,
``I feel like USA Track does everything it can to prevent it from
being a dirty game. There's a lot of clean athletes out there.
Unfortunately, some are not, but that's part of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Washington, American discus competitor said, ``If any of
it comes out to be true, it's a disappointment. I think some people
relish medals more than they care about themselves. I want to live
as long as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Gold-plated Johnson had the last word on how this will affect
the dynamic Mrs. Jones:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, she'll be able to focus on what she is here to do
and hopefully you will allow her to focus on what she is here to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Good luck, Marion. It just got harder to focus on the job at
hand.

 UNDATED: is threatened. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Under the restoration plan, much of the water now diverted to
the east or west _ where it dumps into the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf
of Mexico _ would be captured and sent through the Everglades, just
as occurred before humans started draining what turn-of-the-century
Florida Gov. Napoleon Bonaparte Broward had dubbed ``that
abominable, pestilence-ridden swamp.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, under the Everglades Forever Act passed by the Florida
Legislature in 1994, giant manmade marshes known as stormwater
treatment areas are being created over tens of thousands of acres
to snare agricultural runoff and filter impurities out of it. This
is being done primarily in the area south of huge Lake Okeechobee,
north of the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   One of the negative effects of altering the Everglades' water
flow has been to change the proportions of fresh and salt water in
the bays and estuaries of South Florida. These changes have damaged
breeding grounds for fish, shrimp and crab.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Texas increasingly faces threats to its coastal bays
and estuaries, said Myron Hess, an attorney in Austin for the
National Wildlife Federation, which supports the Everglades'
restoration project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will we be reaching a point to where we're having to try to
restore our bays and estuaries?'' Hess said of the Texas coastline.
``Let's hope we're a little earlier in the process where we can
avoid a lot of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Blackburn, an environmental lawyer from Houston, said the
damage wrought to Florida's bays and estuaries could be repeated in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Already, freshwater river flows to bays and estuaries on the
Texas coast have been altered as a result of increasing demands for
water in an often-dry state with a rapidly growing population,
Blackburn said. That could damage coastal areas that are important
breeding grounds for oysters, crab, shrimp and fish such as
speckled trout, redfish and flounder, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to make sure we don't make the same mistakes they
did in Florida,'' where ``it's costing billions of dollars to fix
it,'' Blackburn said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bauer director of the National Wildlife Federation's
Everglades project office in Florida, said the Glades' restoration
should be important to all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just Florida's Everglades,'' he said. ``It's
America's Everglades, just as the Grand Canyon is not just
Arizona's Grand Canyon and Yosemite is not just California's
Yosemite ... the Everglades' beauty and uniqueness is known
throughout the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The restoration plan was put together by the Army Corps of
Engineers and state and federal scientists. It has the backing of
several major environmental groups, including the National Audubon
Society, the World Wildlife Fund and the National Wildlife
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   But there are critics. Sierra Club officials and others, for
example, have expressed concern that the plan might become
primarily a huge water supply project for South Florida, thus
helping ensure more development and population growth there, rather
than being first and foremost an Everglades restoration effort.
</P>
<P>
   An explanation of the plan (on the Web site
www.evergladesplan.org) says that it ``will ensure a reliable,
adequate supply of fresh water for the environment, as well as
urban and agricultural users,'' with 80 percent going for
environmental purposes and 20 percent for urban and agricultural
water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens for a Sound Economy, a group known for a somewhat
libertarian viewpoint, has questioned why Congress would support an
expensive restoration while at the same time approving subsidies
for big Florida sugar cane growers whose farms have contributed to
the Glades' environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the plan itself, a huge political fight is brewing
over whether to create a large commercial airport and related
development at the former Homestead Air Force Base, which is only
10 miles east of Everglades National Park and two miles west of
Biscayne National Park.
</P>
<P>
   With a projected 245,000 flights a year, including flights over
the Glades, the airport would pose a huge pollution threat from
noise and runoff, environmental groups say. Critics oppose such an
airport and say that any development there should be less
environmentally threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club warns that park visitors ``would be constantly
bombarded by the high pitch blasts of engine turbines.'' Fish,
mammals and birds would face threats from pollution runoff from the
development, the organization said.
</P>
<P>
   Some find it ironic that the Army Corps of Engineers, which
constructed much of the flood-control system that damaged the
Everglades, is poised to play a leading role in attempting to undo
that damage. But the corps' engineering expertise and knowledge of
the Glades will be an asset in carrying out the restoration, some
observers say.
</P>
<P>
   When the corps undertook the flood-control program beginning in
the late 1940s, it did so at the behest of Congress and in the wake
of highly destructive hurricanes that caused major flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Blackburn, the Houston environmental lawyer, says the corps has
a ``remarkable staff'' and is ``probably more qualified than
anybody else'' to restore the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give them a project, and they'll find a way to do it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Adams, a National Audubon Society lobbyist in Washington,
said the corps' flood control effort was ``a project of the best
intentions based on the values of the time. They were taming nature
for human habitation. A lot of good has come out of it for Florida,
in terms of economic development. But looking at it in the lenses
of our times, great harm has been done as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The consensus is that the Everglades must be restored, but there
is great uncertainty as to how effective the complex restoration
plan will be.
</P>
<P>
   Most interested parties agree that it would be the kiss of death
for the Glades if nothing were done.
</P>
<P>
   Hiassen, the Miami Herald columnist, wrote in May that ``the
whole endeavor might end up as a bust.'' But it's a gamble that
must be undertaken, even if the results are highly uncertain, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final verdict will come from our grandchildren and
great-grandchildren,'' he wrote. ``They'll forgive us for failing,
but not for failing to try.''

EFFORT TO RESTORE THE EVERGLADES IS TOO IMPORTANT NOT TO ATTEMPT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JACK Z. SMITH 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If ever there were a project that required a master plumber, the
proposed restoration of the Florida Everglades is it.
</P>
<P>
   Plumbers are charged with making water systems work reliably.
That's precisely the challenge in the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   What's proposed is a colossal repair job _ a $7.8 billion
undertaking labeled as the largest environmental restoration
project in history.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is now considering legislation to provide federal
funding for the project in partnership with the state of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The project has two major goals.
</P>
<P>
   One is to resuscitate the Everglades' unique and heavily damaged
ecosystem by attempting to recreate, as nearly as possible, the
original natural water flow that gave it the name ``River of
Grass.''
</P>
<P>
   The second goal is to ensure adequate future water supplies for
the exploding population of South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration plan calls for storing hundreds of billions of
gallons of water along the fringes of the Everglades, both in
surface reservoirs and in hundreds of wells. At appropriate times,
when greater water flow is needed, it would be pumped into the
Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   It's an elaborate and complex endeavor that government
officials, engineers, environmentalists, scientists, water utility
officials, nature lovers, commercial fishermen, sport fishing
enthusiasts and others will be watching with one burning question
in mind:
</P>
<P>
   How well will it work?
</P>
<P>
   Despite the project's enormous cost, there's a widely held
opinion that it is a worthy endeavor. It's got broad support from
several major environmental groups, many members of Congress from
both major parties, and Florida officials including Gov. Jeb Bush,
brother of Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there is spirited debate about whether the
proposed restoration plan is adequate and about the particulars of
how to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: The project has applications far beyond
the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental destruction already wrought to the Everglades,
and the multibillion-dollar effort to rectify that damage, will
provide lessons in Texas and many other parts of the world about
the need to protect valuable wetlands, bays and estuaries _ and the
adverse environmental and economic consequences of not doing so.
</P>
<P>
   The Everglades once encompassed more than 8 million acres of
South Florida. That area has been cut in half by massive drainage
and development, primarily in the past half century. But the
``Glades,'' as they're often referred to in Florida newspapers,
still stretch across more than 100 miles of South Florida.
Everglades National Park constitutes only one-fifth of this
extraordinary ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   National Parks, the magazine of the National Parks Conservation
Association, has called the Everglades' restoration effort ``the
largest environmental restoration project in the history of
humankind.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Hiassen, a columnist for The Miami Herald, has described
the restoration project as ``the most ambitious plumbing repair in
the history of the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress is considering authorizing an early round of funding
for the restoration, which is estimated to cost $7.8 billion and
take more than 20 years to complete.
</P>
<P>
   As proposed, the federal government would pay half the cost, and
the remaining half would come from Florida and local agencies
there.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water
Management District would play leading roles in the project. But
there's already bickering about the financial burden likely to be
borne by various entities within Florida, including Miami-Dade
County government.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of damage imposed by humans, the Everglades is
suffering from a greatly diminished water flow that has caused
great harm to animal and plant life while also threatening the
commercial fishing, sport fishing and tourism industries of South
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to provide an adequate water supply for the human
population in the fast-growing region also has been imperiled.
</P>
<P>
   South Florida, which had only a half million people when
Everglades National Park was created in 1947, now has 6 million
people and is expected to have 12 million or more by 2050.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was the Army Corps of Engineers, targeted to help
direct the Everglades' restoration, that played a preeminent role
in its environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1940s, two monumental events in the Glades' history
occurred. Everglades National Park was created, and Congress
directed the corps to oversee a gargantuan flood control project
for South Florida after two hurricanes that had killed thousands of
people and caused widespread flooding.
</P>
<P>
   During the next 25 years, the corps built 1,400 miles of canals,
levees, dikes and pump stations that, while reducing flood damage,
also diverted much of the Glades' flow of fresh water by taking it
out to the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a staggering amount of water _ an estimated 1.7 billion
gallons a day _ is flushed out to sea. As a result, the Everglades
has been severely drained, and serious water shortages loom in
coming decades in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Under the restoration project, a sizable portion of the corps'
system of canals, dikes and levees would be dismantled and more
water would be directed through the Glades in an attempt to return
it closer to its natural state.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Everglades National Park Web site, the numbers
of wading birds nesting in the southern Everglades has declined by
93 percent since the 1930s _ from 265,000 to 18,500. These birds
include herons, egrets, ibis and storks.
</P>
<P>
   There also has been great damage to the habitat of animals such
as the Florida panther (now believed to number only a few dozen),
the West Indian manatee, the American crocodile and various species
of turtles.
</P>
<P>
   Human tinkering also has fostered the growth of unwanted plants
_ notably cattails _ at the expense of native vegetation such as
the Everglades' signature sawgrass.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Times-Union in Jacksonville has described the
Everglades as ``the kidney of the entire state's water system,
filtering out impurities in the water as it flowed into the
Atlantic Ocean and Florida Bay at the south end of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   But that filtering ability has been diminished by the alteration
of the Glades' water flow. Further damage has been done by
pollutants from sugar cane farms and other agricultural activity
north of the Glades. The result is that the quality of South
Florida's drinking water is threatened.

oaks and deep overhanging eaves. But step inside, and it's another

   SYDNEY _ But what about Marion?
</P>
<P>
   That's what the latest drug scandal to bedevil the Olympic Games
is really all about. Oh, the principals were busy Monday engaging
in a great debate concerning implications of guilt, presumptions of
innocence, the inalienable right of due process, and the integrity
of organizational agendas. But practically speaking, all the
profound rhetoric was pompous nonsense. Only one thing mattered to
the public, and it was of a decidedly personal nature because it
involved the most intriguing individual subplot of the Sydney
Games:
</P>
<P>
   Will this whole mess ruin Marion Jones's chances for five gold
medals?
</P>
<P>
   The fate of America's track sweetheart dwarfs the larger issues
in the wake of the revelation that her husband, 1999 world champion
shot putter C.J. Hunter, tested positive for the banned anabolic
steroid nandrolone at the Bislett Games in Oslo July 28. Hunter had
qualified for Sydney by finishing second in the US trials. But in
the wake of the drug test, he conveniently became a scratch when he
elected to undergo knee surgery Sept. 3, presumably forestalling
any fallout that might affect his wife's bid to become the most
decorated woman in a single Summer Games as she seeks a gold
necklace in the 100 and 200 meters, long jump, and 4x100 and 4x400
relays.
</P>
<P>
   When word of Hunter's drug test dropped from tabloid heaven with
a report in the Sydney Daily Telegraph _ later confirmed by both
International Olympic Committee vice president Dick Pound and
track's worldwide overseer, the International Amateur Athletic
Federation _ the sides started digging trenches.
</P>
<P>
   Several international officials _ Prince Alexandre de Merode,
the IOC drug czar; IAAF doping chieftain Arne Ljungqvist; and IOC
athletics commission member and former Olympic speedskating
champion Johan Koss, among others _ launched salvos of blanket
indictments. They variously accused the sport's American governing
body, USA Track and Field, of having covered up positive tests in
the past, refusing to adhere to international standards, and
employing a lax and tardy investigative process that gives its
athletes an unfair advantage.
</P>
<P>
   USATF chief executive Craig Masback parried with a series of
generalities in which he defended his organization's methods. He
never addressed Hunter's case specifically _ confidentiality rights
and all that, don't you know _ but he made it clear that he
believes truth, justice, and the American way should be the
foundation for drug policies among all nations and in all sports.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hunter took cover under a vague veil of innocence,
issuing a statement through Olympic broadcaster NBC in which he
said, ``I know what is going on and I am aware of the allegations
and am going to defend myself vigorously.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever that means, the nasty give-and-take can't be of any
service to his wife's cause.
</P>
<P>
   Even Masback, displaying a high-priced lawyer's grasp of
evasiveness during a press conference beneath the track at Olympic
Stadium on the sport's biggest night of the Games, acknowledged
that Hunter's situation would make Jones's campaign more
problematic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along that the challenge faced by Marion Jones
is a very significant one,'' said Masback. ``She's a prohibitive
favorite in only two of the five events, the 100 meters and 200
meters. She's the first to admit her shortcomings in the long jump
and she's working on that event. And the relays are by no means a
lock. So the challenge Marion Jones is facing, a very real athletic
challenge, has only been made more challenging by all the
developments here.''
</P>
<P>
   It continues Wednesday when Jones begins competition in the 200
and the long jump, hoping to add those to the 100-meter gold she
banked Saturday. At least one of her colleagues figures that task
has been complicated by the Hunter affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has the potential'' to affect Jones, said women's
400-meter world record-holder Kim Batten, who failed Monday to
qualify for the finals. ``He's her husband. She obviously loves
him. It's got to affect her somewhat. I know Marion. I went to her
wedding. I wish her well the whole way. But it's got to be
confusing to her. She's worked so hard for this, and now this
distraction. It makes that job a little bit tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was incommunicado Monday even as speculation swirled that
she must have known about Hunter's alleged actions. But Batten
ventured an educated guess about her teammate's state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little lost,'' said Batten. ``Scared. Very defensive. She's
doing all the things she shouldn't be doing right now. I wish I
could just tell her to put these things behind her. But it carries
over, no doubt. It's got to be devastating. Not just to her but to
everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope she has a very good adviser. If I were her, I wouldn't
answer any questions between now and the end because she has a job
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before, Masback had been busy answering a fusillade of
questions _ at least the ones he chose to.
</P>
<P>
   He vehemently defended the US testing policy, which emphasizes
confidentiality until the process of adjudication and appeal has
been exhausted, only after which a transgressor's name is revealed.
This is in contrast to the swift and public justice administered by
many other national governing bodies, who have expressed
frustration that the American system constitutes preferential
treatment. Masback countered that the procedure is an inevitable
response to a litigious society and a firm belief that no public
accusations should be made after one positive drug test _
especially since the B portion of the divided samples occasionally
has confirmed a defendant's innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tested more people for more substances more frequently
over a longer period of time than any national governing body, any
federation in any sport,'' said Masback. ``I'm not the least bit
defensive. Track and field doesn't have anything to apologize or be
defensive about. We are the world leader in this.''
</P>
<P>
   He took the opportunity to respond to some world leaders in drug
testing who have been critical of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   De Merode came in for the most pointed rejoinder. The IOC
executive had accused the United States of covering up five
positive drug tests before the 1988 Seoul Olympics _ an allegation
refuted by US Olympic Committee spokesman Mike Moran, who said the
cases had been publicized at the time and that all the athletes had
been exonerated because they inadvertently took the banned
stimulant ephedrine, found in some nonprescription cold
medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose I could get in a discussion with (de Merode) about
the history of the administration of the Olympic drug testing
program,'' said Masback. ``But that probably wouldn't be in
anyone's best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Lungqvist had been quoted as saying that USATF failed to respond
to 15 IAAF notifications of positive drug tests, which Masback
countered. ``I regret what he said because it was the result of a
misunderstanding and a lack of communication,'' said Masback. ``But
the good side of it is that we cleared that up. We have an
understanding of how (the IAAF would) like us to communicate with
them, how they would like us to pass along information, and how we
can keep them current so they don't feel there's anything they're
not receiving.''
</P>
<P>
   He was emphatic about one thing USATF has not received _ a
single notification of a positive drug test involving any American
athlete who qualified for these Olympics. That led to some sparring
with Koss, who maintained that the United States's protracted
testing and appeal process creates an uneven playing field for
athletes from other nations who are subject to more rapid
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of 210 countries, there are 190 who don't test out of
competition,'' which USATF does, said Masback. ``It's US athletes
who could complain about not competing on a level playing field.
Obviously, since no athlete has tested positive, I disagree (with
Koss). It's demonstrably false. I like Johan, He's a great guy. We
share opinions on a lot of issues, but I have to respectfully
disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Masback's efforts at damage control, US athletes were
feeling the stigma of guilt by association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the IOC and the media have drawn attention to this,
but at the same time, it makes me feel very on edge,'' said Batten.
``And I honestly think it puts a heavy burden on all the athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it angers a lot of athletes. We've had a number of
talks in the village among us about how this can affect you. It's
just heavy on the mind, and it's heavy on the heart. When you know
you're not doing anything wrong, you have to carry that weight,
too, because you're in it with everybody else. Until it's cleaned
up, I don't know what can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   More important in the immediate picture is what this might do to
Jones.

<TEXT>
<P>
   At the age of 11 Mary Karr wrote in her diary: ``I am not very
successful as a little girl. When I grow up, I will probably be a
mess.'' Writing, however, was already providing her with the tool
of detachment to cope with her sense of estrangement, and she knew,
as early as then, what her vocation would be: She wanted to grow up
and ``write one-half poetry and one-half autobiography.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is exactly what Mary Karr would do. In addition
to three volumes of poetry she would go on to write ``The Liars'
Club,'' one of her generation's most eloquent, heart-grabbing
memoirs, a pitch-perfect account of her childhood in the
hardscrabble East Texas town she calls Leechfield.
</P>
<P>
   Published to critical hosannas in 1995, ``The Liars' Club''
chronicled, with exceptional candor and grace, the harrowing events
of Karr's seventh and eighth years _ she was raped by a boy from
school, molested by a baby sitter and made witness to her mother's
spectacular nervous breakdown _ and it left the reader with an
indelible portrait of her eccentric family and its emotional legacy
of rebellion and disaffection.
</P>
<P>
   By the time ``Cherry,'' the sequel to ``Liars' Club,'' opens,
Karr's parents have receded into the background. Her father is
increasingly absent from the house, while her bohemian mother
shrugs off her maternal duties: She takes the reluctant 14-year-old
Mary to get birth control pills, then withdraws into a
Valium-fueled dream world of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Because Karr's parents _ who were such towering, mythic figures
in ``Liars' Club'' _ are more marginal in this volume, because the
events of Karr's teen-age years are less overtly dramatic than
those of her childhood, ``Cherry'' lacks, at first glance, the
fierce singularity of ``Liars' Club.'' And yet after a somewhat
hesitant start, she proves herself as fluent in evoking the common
ground of adolescence as she did in limning her anomalous girlhood.
</P>
<P>
   She captures, exactly, what it's like for a girl to kiss the
first boy she loves, her whole body purring, his face floating in
her mind's eye ``with red Magic Marker hearts scribbled around
it.'' She captures, exactly, what it's like to start high school,
to stride into the auditorium wearing a ``daisy-spattered dress,
scanning for the right place to sit,'' while jockeying with
schoolmates to establish a persona and a self. And she captures,
exactly, what it's like to be a book-hungry teen-ager, enraptured
by the words and heady ideas that offer transport from the
banalities of small-town life.
</P>
<P>
   Later in ``Cherry'' Karr conjures, with startling
verisimilitude, the glassy aerial state of being high on a
combination of pharmaceuticals, where time ``blinks on and off like
a strobe light,'' people take on a comic-book radiance, and ``the
membrane that separates your inner world from outer phenomena''
melts and fades away.
</P>
<P>
   As she did in ``Liars' Club,'' Karr combines a poet's lyricism
and a Texan's down-home vernacular with her natural storytelling
gift. Some of her stories are nostalgic for a vanished time and
place; some are scathing in their evocation of an insular world;
some are just plain funny.
</P>
<P>
   She recounts the time she tried to commit suicide by overdosing
on Anacin, then grumbling, as she waited for it to take effect,
that she was forced to die to the mundane sounds of her neighbors
arguing about their rosebushes. In another chapter she recounts her
efforts to work a voodoo love spell on her longtime object of
affection: Having retrieved his family's hairbrush, she tried in
vain to distinguish the hairs of her would-be lover from those of
his relatives, finally grabbing them all, figuring she would let
the entire household ``be nuts about me.''
</P>
<P>
   In many of Karr's stories, however, there is an undertow of
sadness and regret. The episode in which she and a group of friends
are arrested for creating a public disturbance (and later busted
for drugs) is a harbinger of more serious jail terms for some of
them, as well as assorted freak-outs, car wrecks and ``drug-related
obliterations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some kids leave elite prep schools like St. Paul's or Choate
with entry into certain colleges, mastery of certain protocols,''
she writes. ``In the same way, one leaves Leechfield with raw tales
on which to dine out, a sense of having escaped, and the capacity
for both pathos'' and rage ``that would make for either an
excellent nun or a fearless infantry soldier.''
</P>
<P>
   The self-portrait Karr draws in this volume is that of a
would-be outlaw, a rebel sometimes scared of her own impulses, a
girl avid to grow up and yet reluctant to relinquish her remaining
innocence. She was becoming, she writes, ``a worrier, a world-class
insomniac, what one friend would later call a grief-seeking
missile.''
</P>
<P>
   What she is, most insistently, is a witness to her own life: She
is there, she writes, ``to watch'' and report. Even as a child, she
is busy keeping a journal, transforming her experiences into prose,
and she will continue to do so throughout her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cherry'' begins teasingly with Karr referring to her decision
to leave Leechfield and invent a new self, ``golden and
unalterable,'' with her surfer pals in the promised land of
California. As it turns out, this volume ends before she actually
departs to take up that new life. For that story, we must wait _
and after ``Liars' Club'' and ``Cherry,'' we wait eagerly _ for
what will undoubtedly be the next installment of Karr's life.

`COMEDY OF INNOCENCE': EXCESSIVE MIND GAMES AND A LABORED CLIMAX 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the center of ``The Comedy of Innocence'' is a round-faced,
apple-cheeked moppet named Camille (Nils Hugon), who lives in
serene haut-bourgeois elegance in an old house in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after his ninth birthday, Camille, whose closest
companions are a possibly imaginary friend named Alexandre and a
videocamera, starts behaving strangely. He insists that his name is
Paul and starts addressing his mother (Isabelle Huppert), with cold
formality, by her first name, which is Ariane.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he has dragged her halfway across the city to the chic
bohemian apartment of the woman he claims is his real mother, a
flighty violin teacher named Isabella (Jeanne Balibar), whose son
drowned two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   What is going on here? Some kind of strange supernatural event?
Is this the latest movie to explore the possibility of parallel
realities, to imagine a kind of lived hypertext? For its first
hour, Raul Ruiz's film, adapted from a novel by the Italian writer
Massimo Bontempelli called ``The Boy With Two Mothers,'' weaves an
elegant spell of epistemological confusion.
</P>
<P>
   The quiet, elegant Parisian interiors take on a spooky,
claustrophobic feel, which is intensified by the odd behavior of
the people who inhabit them. Camille's uncle Serge (Charles
Berling), a psychiatrist, is prone to odd mood swings; the au pair,
Helene, sulks passive-aggressively around the house; and Isabella
has a creepy neighbor whose most banal utterances sound mysterious,
even threatening.
</P>
<P>
   But after a while the atmosphere starts to feel less haunting
than irritating. Ruiz might have approached this material with
Hitchcockian precision or Bunuelesque insouciance. Either of these
directors would have pushed the confusion to some kind of dramatic
or comic peak, but ``The Comedy of Innocence'' is content, like
Ariane, to wander and brood.
</P>
<P>
   Events that should at least provoke a tremor of surprise _ Why
does Isabella move in with Ariane? Why does Ariane permit it? _
unfold so casually that they seem less mysterious than matter of
fact.
</P>
<P>
   Huppert, a peerless purveyor of stifled melancholy, played a
similar role _ a sorrowful, wealthy wife wandering the sepulchral
halls of her ritzy home _ in Benoit Jacquot's ``Pas de Scandale.''
But she suffers with such passive stoicism that she robs the film
of a psychological perspective it desperately needs.
</P>
<P>
   On Ariane's living room wall hangs an etching of King Solomon
settling a quarrel between two women arguing over a baby. In the
Bible story, the real mother is the one who offers the child to her
rival, rather than stand by while the king cuts the baby in half.
(The picture, Serge comments, is ``a bit too pertinent.'' I agree.)
Perhaps Ariane's stunned acquiescence to Isabella's intrusion is
proof that she loves Camille more.
</P>
<P>
   But psychological motive is not the film's primary concern.
Rather, Ruiz seems enchanted with his own coyness and the curlicues
and indirections the story allows him. He makes enthusiastic use of
the video-within-the-film, which allows him to vary the movie's
visual texture. But this technique is fast becoming tired and
tiresome, and here it feels teasing and pretentious. The film's
labored climax turns on the revelation that someone has been
playing an elaborate mind game. This doesn't come as news: the mind
game is ``Comedy of Innocence'' itself, and the perpetrator has
been Ruiz all along.  &QL;

&HT;     WHITE HOUSE PANEL PUSHES BETTER EDUCATION FOR HISPANICS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: Avance Inc. is CQ)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States must make a concerted effort to
raise standards and increase involvement in education of Hispanics
so that young Latinos are on par with other children by 2010, a
White House commission said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of economic and national security that we make
sure the fastest growing community in these United States does not
fall behind,'' said Guillermo Linares, chairman of the President's
Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for Hispanic
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The commission released its report, ``Creating the Will,'' at a
news conference. ``We must not leave any child behind, and this
report is attempting to address that in a very direct way,''
Linares said.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes at an important crossroads for the education
issue. Vice President Gore, the Democratic presidential hopeful,
and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican nominee, are vying
over who can position himself as the education candidate and appeal
to voters for whom education is a top issue, particularly women.
</P>
<P>
   The 75-page report was less of a call for new programs and
spending than a summary of activities by government agencies,
corporations, schools, parents and community organizations to
improve the education of Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Many of its recommendations to the next administration are
non-controversial ideas already in place or endorsed by Bush and
Gore. For instance, the report concludes the next president must
play a role in helping states educate children, the education
secretary must make educating Hispanic children a high priority,
and the White House must continue to foster American leadership in
the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are very, very high indeed,'' said Education
Secretary Richard W. Riley, who noted that in less than 25 years
one in four public school students will be Hispanic. ``I am very
optimistic about the future of Hispanic education and the future of
our nation, and I think the two go hand in hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics comprise 15 percent of the nation's elementary school
population, and 13 percent of the high school population.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the administration's pushing through funding increases
to boost minority achievement, the gap between standardized test
scores of whites and minorities has either widened or stayed the
same since President Clinton was elected in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Gore advocates an ambitious $170 billion in spending over 10
years aimed at school construction, smaller class sizes, making
standards tougher and closing te test-score gap, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   Bush proposes a more modest $47.6 billion, focused primarily on
higher standards and closing the testing gap. He excoriates Gore
for his ``bricks-and-mortar'' approach to education, saying the
vice president pays less attention to the quality of classroom
learning.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also rarely fails to mention that on his watch as governor,
the test-score gap between minorities and whites narrowed. He lays
blame for the widening national gap at Gore's door.
</P>
<P>
   Some on the 21-member commission, appointed by Clinton in 1994,
gave qualified praise to Bush for his achievements in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a major effort for 15 years, including under
Gov. Bush, where the resources have actually continued (to grow),''
said Sonia Hernandez, vice chairwoman of the commission. ``He's
done a good of maintaining quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Rodriguez, president of San Antonio-based Avance Inc.,
which helps parents prepare toddlers for school, said ``we applaud
Gov. Bush's efforts in early childhood education. Could he have
done more? I'd say yes We still have a lot of problems, especially
in our border cities.''

   GORE-BIANCHI _ WASHINGTON - Ever since Al Gore described her as
``scary smart'' in a newspaper interview, Sarah Bianchi has gotten
a lot of good-natured kidding from family and friends. And when
asked to confirm Gore's assessment, she demurs. ``Scary, maybe,''
she says. But when it comes to issues like health care, Medicare,
Medicaid, Social Security and welfare reform, Gore turns first to
the 27-year-old Atlanta native. (Shepard, Cox News Service). 30.

County Sheriff's spokesman Paul Miller said the South Central

   ROVE _ In the midst of a heated election, there is the
suggestion that one campaign was illegally infiltrated. The FBI is

presidential race of 2000, but the Texas gubernatorial race of
1986. That year Karl Rove, now George W. Bush's chief political
strategist, announced he had found a bugging device in his office.
But Democrats, among them Mark McKinnon - now also working for Bush
- suggests Rove bugged himself. We lay out the events of 1986 and

   EDUCATING-HISPANICS _ WASHINGTON Ways to lift the educational

students by 2010 are spelled out in a final report to be handed to

Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence. In their swan song,
after years of explaining how and why so many Hispanics are so
poorly educated, the commissioners offer tips to educators,
businesses, Hispanic parents and the next president on how to reach
that goal. (Mollison, Cox News Service). 20.

   STONEMOUNTAIN _ STONE MOUNTAIN, Ga. _ To some who've never heard

choice destinations for lovers of retired country music acts, Elvis
impersonators and outlet shopping - it's an amusement park operator
that's about to blight a Confederate monument and Mother Nature.
Ever since securing a lease to manage Stone Mountain Park
operations, Silver Dollar officials have been fighting an uphill

operators they've been made out to be. (Smith, The Altanta

   RANCH-HOUSES _ WACO, Texas _ It's architecture that evokes Mom's

the 21st century as icons of suburbia, at its cookie-cutter worst
and its bucolic best. And now the moment of truth is arriving: Do

oaks and deep overhanging eaves. But step inside, and it's another
story altogether. Bursting with shiny orange, turquoise, hot pink,
black and yellow surfaces, furnished with sleek appliances and
furniture, the home's interior looks like a home decor ad from the
Kennedy era. Ralph Wilson Sr., founder of Wilsonart International
plastics company, built the house in 1959 as his private home and a
showcase for his laminates, then an exotic new material not widely
used in homes. In 1998, it was named to the National Register of

National Trust for Historic Preservation. (JBSmith, Waco

<P>
   In 1983, the morning sickness drug Bendectin was removed from
the market amid a barrage of lawsuits claiming that it caused birth
defects. Now, in what medical and legal experts say is an
unprecedented reversal of fortune, it may well be brought back.
</P>
<P>
   A small, privately held Canadian company, Duchesnay Inc., is
working with the Food and Drug Administration to gain permission to
market a generic version of Bendectin, which it calls Diclectin.
Duchesnay is already selling the drug, its only product, in Canada,
labeling and marketing it specifically for pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   The company says _ and medical experts agree _ that dozens of
studies, many prompted by the litigation, have failed to find that
Bendectin poses any dangers to pregnant women or their fetuses. And
the drug agency said that since Bendectin was withdrawn by its
maker, independently of the agency, and was not withdrawn for
reasons of safety or efficacy, it might not be difficult to bring
it back.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea C. Masciale, a lawyer for the agency, explained that all
Duchesnay had to do was show the FDA that its generic Bendectin was
chemically the same as the original drug. No clinical studies or
research are required, which simplifies the process of its
reintroduction. ``We think they can achieve a product that is the
same as Bendectin and therefore come in with a generic version of
Bendectin,'' Masciale said.
</P>
<P>
   The development has stunned medical and legal experts, who say
that the possible re-emergence of Bendectin is so bold and
unprecedented that they are at a loss for comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   For many drug companies, birth defect experts, obstetricians and
law professors, the Bendectin story is unforgettable. Bendectin is
the only drug withdrawn from the market solely because of
litigation, said Jeffrey Trewhitt, a spokesman for the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bendectin was the archetypical case of junk science scuttling
a perfectly safe product,'' said Dr. Michael Greene, the director
of maternal-fetal medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital in
Boston. ``It was a sad episode in American jurisprudence.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Bernstein, a law professor at George Mason University
in Virginia, said it was only a twisted sort of poetic justice to
bring back Bendectin. ``There's no justice to the company who spent
over $100 million in litigation, not to mention having their chief
executives tied up in litigation for years and years,'' Bernstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   By 1980, 10 percent to 20 percent of pregnant women in the
United States were taking Bendectin. But soon afterward, when the
litigation was in full swing, Bendectin acquired a reputation
similar to that of thalidomide, the sedative that caused horrific
birth defects when women took it early in pregnancy. Women who took
Bendectin and also had babies with birth defects, especially limb
defects like missing fingers or missing bones from an arm or a leg,
found it hard to believe that the drug was not the cause. In fact,
one out of every 2,000 American babies born each year has a limb
defect and 2.5 percent of babies have serious birth defects. Yet
even if Bendectin was safe, as its defenders argued, few women or
their doctors wanted to use it.
</P>
<P>
   But now, doctors say, many of their pregnant patients have never
heard of the drug. That means that if Bendectin does return, it may
come in as a fresh product to a generation that has no prejudice
against it, medical experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Gervais, Duchesnay's executive vice president, is
optimistic that he will get the drug agency's approval to market
his generic version of Bendectin. In Canada, he said, the company
sells 70,000 bottles of Diclectin each year.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anthony Scialli, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at
Georgetown University School of Medicine, agreed. ``There's a huge
amount of safety data on Bendectin,'' Scialli said. ``It was the
best studied medication in pregnancy of all time _ not just for
nausea and vomiting, but the best studied, period.''
</P>
<P>
   Bendectin's maker, Merrell Dow, removed the drug from the market
not because of jury verdicts, but simply because of the expense of
dealing with thousands of lawsuits, said one of the company's
lawyers, Frank Woodside of Cincinnati. In fact, Woodside said, the
company never actually lost a case.
</P>
<P>
   The litigation eventually made legal history. Lawyers
representing women who said the drug had damaged their children
brought experts into court who were unqualified to comment and were
propounding junk science, critics said. In 1993, the Supreme Court
ruled on the matter, concluding that judges are to act as
gatekeepers and ensure that ``any and all scientific testimony or
evidence admitted is not only relevant, but reliable.'' Many judges
have made it clear that they will no longer allow Bendectin cases
in their courts.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Nace, a Washington lawyer who has represented close to 200
Bendectin families, said the lawsuits were pretty much hopeless.
``They make it so hard for plaintiffs to win these cases that it
almost doesn't matter what you say.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the drug's safety, Nace said, ``In my mind, there is no
question that Bendectin causes birth defects.''
</P>
<P>
   While Nace says he shudders to think that Bendectin might
return, obstetricians say they welcome it.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Lockwood, chairman of the department of obstetrics
and gynecology at New York University School of Medicine, said he
has seen large numbers of pregnant women whose lives were made
miserable by nausea and vomiting. ``We try all sorts of different
remedies,'' Lockwood said. In desperation, a few doctors say they
tell women essentially to make their own Bendectin. The
ingredients, an antihistamine and vitamin B6, are available over
the counter.
</P>
<P>
   Lockwood suggests that women make their own Bendectin. ``I tell
my patients, `I'm going to give you something that is the
equivalent of a drug called Bendectin, which is a great drug that
was forced off the market by litigation,''' he said. ``Our patients
will take anything because they are so miserable.''

<P>
   Al Gore tossed a 74-page Medicare manifesto into the campaign
contest over specifics today, and, stoking distrust of managed
care, promised Florida seniors that he ``won't go along with plans
that would force (seniors) into HMOs.'' The Democrat also suggested
his Republican rival would force the elderly into welfare offices
to get prescription drugs. Campaigning with his wife, Tipper, in
St. Petersburg, Gore said George W. Bush's drug plan ``could run
seniors through welfare offices'' and would ``violate their sense
of dignity.'' Bush denies the characterization. He proposes to
phase in his drug plan, relying for the first four years on grants
to states. Currently, just four of the dozen or so states that
offer drug coverage to poor seniors run the program out of their
welfare offices.
</P>
<P>
   EDUCATION `RECESSION' SUGGESTED
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, opening a three-day West Coast swing, is
suggesting the nation is in the grips of an ``education recession''
even as it enjoys good economic times. Backed by new ads, Bush
planned to focus on his education proposals in Oregon, Washington
and California. ``I believe every child can learn, and I refuse to
accept excuses when they don't, and so should our society,'' Bush
said Monday. He stressed accountability for schools, while
criticizing Al Gore's plan for government-financed preschool for
children ages 3 to 6: ``He doesn't have nearly enough money to make
good on that promise.'' Meanwhile, a new Republican Party ad citing
low test scores, particularly in math and science, implied that
part of the blame rests with the Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   GORE INCREASING CALIFORNIA LEAD
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's campaign trips to California and his
advertising drive in the state have done little to reverse support
for Al Gore, according to a survey released today. A San Francisco
Examiner/KTVU-TV poll shows Gore leading Bush 50-to-38 percent _
the first time the vice president had hit the 50 percent mark. The
poll has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points. That same poll
taken in July, just before the national conventions, showed Gore 7
points ahead of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   WORKER TAX CUTS PROMOTED
</P>
<P>
   On his way to tour tornado-ravaged Xenia, Ohio, Dick Cheney
stopped at a steel plant in Streetsboro to tell employees the
federal budget surplus was ``created by the American worker'' and
should be returned to them through tax cuts. Cheney told workers at
Cleveland Steel Container Corp., where workers make $10 to $20 an
hour making steel pails, that they could get as much as $1,600 a
year in tax relief under George W. Bush's plan, but might get
nothing under the Democratic proposal. Cheney sported a blue
Cleveland Indians jacket and open-neck shirt instead of his usual
dark suit and tie.
</P>
<P>
   THAT OTHER CAMPAIGN TRAIL
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lieberman hopped off one campaign trail and onto another,
returning to Connecticut to campaign today for his Senate seat.
State law permits him to compete for Senate re-election and the
vice presidency at the same time, though Lieberman's critics _ and
even some supporters _ have questioned the wisdom of doing both.
Lieberman's schedule today was a mixed bag: some Senate business,
some Senate campaigning and a couple of fund-raisers for the
Democratic National Committee, where his role was that of Al Gore's
running mate. Some of the senator's vice-presidential campaign
staff dropped out of sight for the day so as to avoid any violation
of Federal Election Commission rules, and some old faces from his
Senate office suddenly appeared.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTIONNAIRE QUESTION AVOIDED
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney declined during appearances on the Sunday talk shows
to say if he had completed the questionnaire given to other
potential running mates for George W. Bush. Cheney had been in
charge of the vetting process for the ticket's No. 2 slot until
being tapped in late July by Bush. Asked by Cokie Roberts on ABC's
``This Week'' if he had completed the survey, he said, ``I did in
many parts of it.'' The issue of Cheney's own vetting process had
been raised again in a Washington Post article that reported many
of the issues Cheney has stumbled over in the campaign were
included in the lengthy and detailed questionnaire all the other
potential choices had to fill out.
</P>
<P>
   NEW POLLS SHOW TIGHTENING
</P>
<P>
   New national and state polls show George W. Bush regaining
momentum following a week of embarrassments and misstatements by Al
Gore and one of Bush's best weeks yet on the campaign trail.
CNN-USA Today-Gallup national poll: Bush 47 percent, Gore 46
percent (4 percentage point margin of error). Voter.com
Battleground national poll: Bush 42 percent, Gore 41 percent (3
point error margin). Bluegrass State poll (for Kentucky): Bush 51
percent, Gore 41 percent (4 point error margin). Marist Poll (for
New York): Gore 55 percent, Bush 32 percent (4.5 point error
margin). Wisconsin Poll (for Wisconsin): Gore 43 percent, Bush 38
percent (4 point error margin).
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: AS LITTLE BOSTON AS POSSIBLE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush may have finally agreed to next week's debate in
Boston, but his campaign is scheduling as little time there as
possible: Not even one night in the city. Bush, who has made no
secret of his disdain for the liberal establishment of his business
school alma mater, Harvard, had tentatively planned to stay over
Monday night. But those plans are now off, and campaign officials
don't expect that to change between now and Oct. 3. Massachusetts
is considered such a long shot for Bush that he has not set foot in
the state since June. Al Gore, meanwhile, is planning an overnight
stay in Boston on Oct. 3 after the debate.

   WEB VIDEOTAPE DEBATE FOR THIRD PARTIES
</P>
<P>
   It is apparent that the Green Party's Ralph Nader and Reform
Party's Pat Buchanan are not going to be allowed to appear in the
three nationally televised presidential debates, but that doesn't
mean their views will be shut out completely. Voters can check them
out on the Web. The video-on-demand Internet site
FreedomChannel.com has invited Nader and Buchanan, as well as
Natural Law Party nominee John Hagelin, Libertarian nominee Harry
Browne and Constitution Party nominee Howard Phillips, to submit
videotaped answers to all the questions posed to the major party
nominees. The answers will be posted within 24 to 48 hours of the
live debates and will appear directly along side George W. Bush's
and Al Gore's answers on the site.

   ROCKER'S ASSISTANCE FOR NADER
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Jam leader Eddie Vedder got political in Seattle,
performing a pair of songs at a rally for Ralph Nader during a
fund-raising event at Key Arena. Vedder, currently between touring
stints with his rock group, took to the stage only with an acoustic
guitar and a ukulele and strummed through ``Soon Forget,'' a track
from the band's new CD, and another song, ``I'm A Patriot.'' Vedder
dedicated ``Soon Forget'' to Microsoft co-founders Paul Allen and
Bill Gates, and he described the song as being ``about a man whose
immense wealth can buy Corvettes and high-rise apartments, but
can't buy back his soul.'' Nader, a longtime consumer activist, has
been campaigning against corporate power.
</P>
<P>
   BUT FIRST, THERE'S THE MATTER OF AN ELECTION
</P>
<P>
   Baylor University President Robert B. Sloan reportedly already
has begun plans for a library to house the papers and mementos of a
George W. Bush Presidential Library. ``You have to take a few risks
in life to be on the cutting edge.'' The Associated Press quoted
Sloan as saying. But Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker called the talk
of a presidential library ``very premature,'' adding, ``We're glad
that people are excited about it, but we've got to get there
first.'' The AP said Baylor's board of regents have yet to see a
proposal and have no money earmarked for a library. Baylor is in
Waco, Texas.

<P>
   APARTMENT HUNTING IN MANHATTAN?
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, who's running for the
Senate from New York, are looking for a New York City apartment for
after the president leaves office in January, according to the New
York Post. The apartment would serve as a second residence for the
Clintons, who bought a house in suburban Chappaqua last year. Two
possibilities are a two-bedroom Park Avenue condo and a
three-bedroom on Central Park West. Each is listed at just under $2
million, the Post said. The Clintons' primary considerations,
according to the newspaper, are proximity to Central Park and
midtown media outlets, and at least two bedrooms.

   FIRST SENATE DEBATE IN VIRGINIA
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Robb (D-Va.) aggressively challenged former Gov.
George Allen on education and abortion Sunday night in the first
televised debate of their U.S. Senate race. Robb went after Allen
on the Republican challenger's $2,000-a-family education expenses
tax credit proposal and on whether Allen would support abortion
restrictions. Allen countered by assailing Robb's record of voting
for tax increases and his introduction of a bill to increase the
gasoline tax by 50 cents a gallon seven years ago. Allen also tried
to link Robb closely to President Clinton _ who has been unpopular
in Virginia. Robb has been trailing by up to 10 percentage points
in recent polls. Both candidates are former governors: Robb, 61,
served from 1982 to 1986, and Allen, 48, served 1993 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   HE'S TRAILING, BUT PEOPLE KNOW HIM NOW
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein holds a commanding lead over Republican
Rep. Tom Campbell, who's trying to unseat her in California. A San
Francisco Examiner/KTVU-TV poll released today showed Feinstein
leading 53-36 percent. But while trailing, Campbell's bid for the
Senate has increased his name recognition. In May 1999, only 38
percent of the voters recognized Campbell's name. His recognition
factor in the new poll was 83 percent. The poll had a 3.5
percentage point margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   REPUBLICAN LEADS IN HIGH-PROFILE HOUSE RACE
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ernie Fletcher (R-KY.) holds a small lead over Democrat
Scotty Baesler in a closely watched House race, according to a poll
sponsored by the Lexington Herald-Leader and WKYT-TV. Fletcher, a
first-term congressman, has a 6 percentage-point advantage against
Baesler, an ex-congressman who hopes to regain the seat. The poll's
overall margin of error was 3.1 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   CONFIDENT GEPHARDT READY TO REACH OUT
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.) says he's optimistic
that Democrats will regain the House in November, which means he
would be elevated to speaker. In a CNN interview, Gephardt said he
is determined to reach out to centrist Republicans to try to find
policies they can agree on. Gephardt said that when he was majority
leader, before the 1994 Republican takeover, he met with
then-Minority Leader Bob Michel (R-Ill.) ``most every week,
sometimes every day.'' But he says there has been ``no
communication'' with Republican leaders in the House during the
past six years.
</P>
<P>
   IN LIEU OF FLOWERS . . .
</P>
<P>
   It was an unconventional request, but in keeping with their
father's outspoken character. When James E. Fete Sr. of Canton,
Ohio, died of natural causes Sept. 19 at age 71, his adult sons and
daughter ran an obituary in the Canton newspaper. The obit listed
the retired telephone repairman's accomplishments: Korean War
service and 39 years with Ohio Bell. Nothing out of the ordinary,
until the last line: ``In lieu of flowers, vote Bush.''

 &HT;    I gave it a sporting chance, but this Game show's a flop
 &HT;    By The Practical Man
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - The practical man had one heckuva column
worked up for you today, but you can't read it.
</P>
<P>
   Nope. 'Fraid not. Can't let you see it. How come? Because you're
too dang stupid!
</P>
<P>
   Hold your fire! The practical man didn't say that. His boss did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practical Man,'' she said. ``What is this garbage? `Legendre
Polynomials and Your Lawn,' `Better Parenting Through Resonance
Points.' Have you lost your mind? People don't want to read this
nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could throw in a section on `Handbag Dynamics.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get smart with me. Now get out there and write about
something people care about. Write about clothes, or movies. Hey,
write about the Olympics!''
</P>
<P>
   Yuck! Do people care about the Olympics? But the practical man,
being a practical man, wasn't going to argue. Besides, it all pays
the same.
</P>
<P>
   So he went home and whipped out his beer cooler, wrapped himself
in the flag, wedged his widest end into a couch corner and cozied
up to watch and wonder. He saw a parade of princesses perform some
jungle gym tricks. He saw some fat dudes flip four tons of iron
over their heads. He saw that knuckleheaded Equatorial Guinea
swimmer flail and flop all alone in the wide, wide pool. He even
saw that Thorpedo joker and his size 17 feet.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to like it. Honest he did. But it just wasn't there.
The juices weren't flowing. The whole thing had no mo.
</P>
<P>
   The Games were lame. That was obvious. But who was to blame?
That would take some thinking, so the practical man pondered the
puzzler during two nights of TV torture. He tore it up, broke it
down, examined it piece by piece _ and he came up with two reasons
why Sydney's a snooze.
</P>
<P>
   Reason 1:
</P>
<P>
   The events are phony.
</P>
<P>
   Do we really care who's balance beam champeen of the world? Of
course not. It's not only dull to watch kid after kid prance on a
fence post, it's downright depressing to imagine childhoods piddled
away in pursuit of such pointless perfection. And speed swimming _
why? Someone, and the practical man hereby volunteers, should pluck
those pimply punks out of the pool and bellow: ``Sweet mother of
heaven, move on! Cure the sick, write a book, build a bridge _ but
you've played Flipper long enough!''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the Olympics has lost its way. Originally,
the events were grounded in real life. Spectators could relate to
the javelin toss, the hammer throw, the chariot race, wrestling,
running, jumping, etc., because they were hunters, farmers and
warriors who swung, flung, fought, rode and ran every day. You
could admire the winners not only for their skill. You could admire
them as valuable members of society. Plus, you might pick up a few
tips.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Olympics is just a freak show. Here's a guy who can
run full-blast at a sawhorse, bounce on a springboard, twist and
tumble like a two-bit top and land on his feet! Here's another
who's devoted his life to pingpong! Wait! That fella's going to
launch himself kicking and flailing through the air and butt-flop
in a sand pit! And look, over there! Some maniac is going to ram a
3-foot sword down his gullet while walking through fire!
</P>
<P>
   Oops! Wrong circus.
</P>
<P>
   But you get the idea. Instead of the parallel bars, we need
Parallel Cars _ show us some fancy moves for getting around dumbo
drivers on I-95. Instead of the 1,000-meter relay, give us the
1,000-Errand Relay _ and see how many working parents perk up.
Instead of the high jump, institute the Teen Whump _ lots of us
have surly 16-year-olds whose attitudes we'd like to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   If we could see ourselves in the Olympics, it wouldn't be so
hard to care.
</P>
<P>
   Reason 2:
</P>
<P>
   We already won.
</P>
<P>
   Ugh! Oof! Ow! Arghhhh!
</P>
<P>
   That hurt, but don't worry. Extracting the painful truth is the
practical man's favorite pastime, and here's what he pulled out
today: The Olympics isn't about sports. It's not about ``human
drama.'' It's not about ``being the best you can be,'' or
``overcoming the odds,'' or any of that hokey bull they blare on
TV.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics is about war. It's weeny, watered-down war, but
it's war all the same _ and here's the kicker: We like it that way.
Nations can't wait to fly their colors, trumpet their fight songs
and pretend to send their champions onto the gory field to compete
for global dominance. And, heck yeah, we love the bloodless battles
because we get to see how our clan stacks up against potential
enemies _ without risking any real harm.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least we used to love them. We used to think it meant
something if the U.S. hockey team stomped the Russkies. We used to
get a jolt of comfort when our big, strapping boys whupped up on
those little Asian guys. We used to get worried when those
stone-cold European blondies marched over our hapless heroes. We
used to think the medal count pointed to some larger truth because
we used to think the Olympics resonated far beyond sports.
</P>
<P>
   But not anymore. For the U.S., the war's over. We won. We don't
seriously consider any other nation a threat, and so from our lofty
perch as the world's Big Daddy, The Games have become mere games.
And as games _ let's face it _ they stink. As games, they're just a
bunch of goofball, graybeard, gym-class mumbo jumbo that's just too
boring to watch. As games, in short, they're not even football, and
we all know how riveting that is.

 &HT;    Trust me, at their age there is no sex ... Scout's honor
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Back when I was a Boy Scout in the
mid-'50s, sex hadn't been invented, much less homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Married folks procreated by holding hands during Fred Astaire
and Ginger Rogers movies.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scout Manual did make some glancing reference to boys
who were troubled by impure thoughts and spent too much time alone
brooding. This didn't seem to apply to me and my Scouting buddies.
We rather enjoyed our impure thoughts, such as, ``Do Girl Scouts
wear green underthings?'' And if so, what assumptions can we make
about Brownies?
</P>
<P>
   About halfway through sixth grade, things changed. All the girls
were herded into a room, where the school nurse announced a
breakthrough in human relations: Sex.
</P>
<P>
   The boys were given an extra recess and not told doodley-squat
about sex. It was one of those need-to-know deals. The girls needed
to know and the boys didn't.
</P>
<P>
   We later learned from Martha Watson, an advanced thinker and
willing informant, that this sex business was strictly limited to
licensed, church-married adults for the solemn business of
producing babies. The choreography, as Martha explained over her
notes, was improbable and the dress code mortifying: complete
jaybird nakedness like your worst
coming-to-school-without-any-clothes-on nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost too weird to imagine, even with helpful anatomical
drawings on the cafeteria wall behind the Dumpster where Ryland
Tate and his toughs hung out after school.
</P>
<P>
   Except for leakage from the girls' meeting, the boys were left
to speculate.
</P>
<P>
   And speculate we did, especially on Boy Scout camp-outs. We
discussed among ourselves how pretty some of the girls were
getting, and the way girls walked around school holding hands and
whispering, and the exciting time a bunch of girls held down
Stewart Campbell on the playground and made Patricia Jones kiss
him, and how maybe this wasn't such a bad thing if only they knew
how feebly you would resist were they to bring, say, Carol Jo Boyd
over to plant one on you.
</P>
<P>
   I remember one camp-out at O'Leno State Park north of
Gainesville, when it was asked, but not satisfactorily resolved:
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does it feel so good to close-dance with Gussie Truluck?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is Miss Travis always stopping us from close-dancing when
it feels so good?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since you're just crushing up against a dress and crinolines,
why not just put a dress on a store dummy and hug it as much as you
please?''
</P>
<P>
   The session ended on a happy note when Eugene Clayton asked:
``Wanna see naked pictures of Marilyn Monroe in my dad's Playboy?''
</P>
<P>
   Mysteries without any clues, as Bob Seger observes in Night
Moves.
</P>
<P>
   As for homosexuality, I don't recall the subject coming up in
sixth and seventh grades. If our Scout leaders had any improper
thoughts about us, they kept them to themselves. In three years of
Scouting, I never heard a breath of scandal where an adult and a
youngster were concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when such matters were known to me, the adult offender
almost always turned out to be married and a father.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me to my opinion on Boy Scout policy and gays.
</P>
<P>
   I respectfully suggest that the organization waded into an area
that is none of its business. I have already established that sex
wasn't even invented when I was a Scout. I now propose that the
best thing the organization can do is uninvent it. The folks at
Scouting HQ should stick their heads in the sand, where they
belong. Don't ask, don't even admit to having a clue.
</P>
<P>
   I'll take questions now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So an admitted gay man ought to go camping with
impressionable young boys?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can't think of a person less inclined to engage in
inappropriate conduct than one known to be gay. It's the
unadmitted, married, heterosexual pederast that should worry you.
How are you going to screen for these guys?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Scouts are pledged to be morally straight. Gays behave
immorally. How can they be role models?
</P>
<P>
   A: Now I'm confused. All I know about gays is that they are
attracted to their own sex. I know that heteros are attracted to
the opposite sex. Just because you admit to a sexual orientation
doesn't mean you are having sex.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Oh, but they are, they are, and lots of it!
</P>
<P>
   A: OK, you've got me. If we go with the presumption that an
unmarried male _ gay or straight _ is having sex outside of
marriage, then you have to kick out all your straight, single Scout
leaders as improper role models. Let's get out of this impenetrable
thicket right now and set our compasses for the True North of
sexual know-nothingness.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You fool! This is the 21st Century! You can't go back, you
can't ignore sex.
</P>
<P>
   A: The heck I can't. There's no crying in baseball, and there is
no sex in Scouting. If anybody, straight or gay, talks about their
sex lives to youngsters, they should be drummed out of the
organization.

 &HT;    A famous face and a stupi question
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   During Fashion Week, the rules of the celebrity game are simple.
If you're a Big Name attending a show, you pose for pictures and
answer stupid questions. If you're a No Name covering a show, you
take posed pictures and ask stupid questions.
</P>
<P>
   At Oscar de la Renta earlier this week, ``Sex and the City''
star Sarah Jessica Parker was encircled by a press pack starving
for a famous face.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Jessica did her best, but she looked a little worn out by
the frenzy (her hair, however, looked fabulous: blonder than normal
and blown-out stick straight).
</P>
<P>
   When she started wilting, her handler tried to shut people down.
No more questions, the assistant barked. But the intrepid fashion
editor from The Palm Beach Post, not to be outdone by dot-com
scribes and cable-TV hosts, ignored the cease-fire. Her readers
deserved to know what Olympic event Sarah Jessica would most like
to compete in!
</P>
<P>
   Oh, how the handler hated that query. No more, she repeated. But
as the extra-petite Sarah Jessica, ever the gamer, slumped into her
seat, she said: ``I could never compete in any Olympics. My best
thing is as an audience member.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, a quote! Sarah Jessica, we award you the gold for good
sportsmanship!
</P>
<P>
   Oscar de la Renta always presents a winning show.
</P>
<P>
   He keeps the trappings simple _ a stark, white runway; a plain
white backdrop; a high-energy score that's not ear-splittingly
loud.
</P>
<P>
   He puts the biggest-name models on the runway and adoring,
longtime fans in the seats.
</P>
<P>
   The pacing, too, is always right. Even a show with the 66
outfits of Spring 2001 moves at a gallop.
</P>
<P>
   Among them: a lime-green cotton sundress for day, a silver
sequin halter dress for evening, a navy-blue organza evening gown
for the charity ball.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, there is the occasional misstep. But the pink satin
bloomers and turquoise pouf skirt, both of which looked as
unflattering as they sound, are forgiven when Oscar takes his bows.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a perfectly tailored suit and a triumphant smile, he is
the Cary Grant of Seventh Avenue, seemingly a class act in a world
that sorely needs one. Charming, distinguished, debonair, even at a
distance.
</P>
<P>
   A sure sign that designers weren't thinking ``South Florida''
when they made their spring sketches: the preponderance of leather.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Miller's gold leather jacket. BCBG's off-white
patent-leather trenchcoat. Vivienne Tam's midnight-blue leather
pants. Kenneth Cole's olive metallic leather skirt.
</P>
<P>
   Dudes, down in these parts, leather weather is limited to about
10 days a year. And none of them is in spring or summer.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Michael Kors' muse was ``Palm Bitch,'' a cool,
'70s-era socialite. The result was a fun, kicky collection, a
sartorial day at the beach.
</P>
<P>
   His new work, in contrast, is a weekend in Death Valley. The
colors are dusty _ sienna, barley, muslin, cactus _ and the
textures are deliberately a little rough: canvas-backed leather
jackets, cardigans and pullovers that Kors refers to as ``rustic.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with his recent forays into old-school society glamour,
this new group of suede shirts, washed-cotton dresses and shearling
coats looks tired. Like a traveler who spent too many days in the
desert.

 &HT;    I gave it a sporting chance, but this Game show's a flop
 &HT;    By The Practical Man
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - The practical man had one heckuva column
worked up for you today, but you can't read it.
</P>
<P>
   Nope. 'Fraid not. Can't let you see it. How come? Because you're
too dang stupid!
</P>
<P>
   Hold your fire! The practical man didn't say that. His boss did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practical Man,'' she said. ``What is this garbage? `Legendre
Polynomials and Your Lawn,' `Better Parenting Through Resonance
Points.' Have you lost your mind? People don't want to read this
nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could throw in a section on `Handbag Dynamics.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get smart with me. Now get out there and write about
something people care about. Write about clothes, or movies. Hey,
write about the Olympics!''
</P>
<P>
   Yuck! Do people care about the Olympics? But the practical man,
being a practical man, wasn't going to argue. Besides, it all pays
the same.
</P>
<P>
   So he went home and whipped out his beer cooler, wrapped himself
in the flag, wedged his widest end into a couch corner and cozied
up to watch and wonder. He saw a parade of princesses perform some
jungle gym tricks. He saw some fat dudes flip four tons of iron
over their heads. He saw that knuckleheaded Equatorial Guinea
swimmer flail and flop all alone in the wide, wide pool. He even
saw that Thorpedo joker and his size 17 feet.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to like it. Honest he did. But it just wasn't there.
The juices weren't flowing. The whole thing had no mo.
</P>
<P>
   The Games were lame. That was obvious. But who was to blame?
That would take some thinking, so the practical man pondered the
puzzler during two nights of TV torture. He tore it up, broke it
down, examined it piece by piece _ and he came up with two reasons
why Sydney's a snooze.
</P>
<P>
   Reason 1:
</P>
<P>
   The events are phony.
</P>
<P>
   Do we really care who's balance beam champeen of the world? Of
course not. It's not only dull to watch kid after kid prance on a
fence post, it's downright depressing to imagine childhoods piddled
away in pursuit of such pointless perfection. And speed swimming _
why? Someone, and the practical man hereby volunteers, should pluck
those pimply punks out of the pool and bellow: ``Sweet mother of
heaven, move on! Cure the sick, write a book, build a bridge _ but
you've played Flipper long enough!''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the Olympics has lost its way. Originally,
the events were grounded in real life. Spectators could relate to
the javelin toss, the hammer throw, the chariot race, wrestling,
running, jumping, etc., because they were hunters, farmers and
warriors who swung, flung, fought, rode and ran every day. You
could admire the winners not only for their skill. You could admire
them as valuable members of society. Plus, you might pick up a few
tips.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Olympics is just a freak show. Here's a guy who can
run full-blast at a sawhorse, bounce on a springboard, twist and
tumble like a two-bit top and land on his feet! Here's another
who's devoted his life to pingpong! Wait! That fella's going to
launch himself kicking and flailing through the air and butt-flop
in a sand pit! And look, over there! Some maniac is going to ram a
3-foot sword down his gullet while walking through fire!
</P>
<P>
   Oops! Wrong circus.
</P>
<P>
   But you get the idea. Instead of the parallel bars, we need
Parallel Cars _ show us some fancy moves for getting around dumbo
drivers on I-95. Instead of the 1,000-meter relay, give us the
1,000-Errand Relay _ and see how many working parents perk up.
Instead of the high jump, institute the Teen Whump _ lots of us
have surly 16-year-olds whose attitudes we'd like to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   If we could see ourselves in the Olympics, it wouldn't be so
hard to care.
</P>
<P>
   Reason 2:
</P>
<P>
   We already won.
</P>
<P>
   Ugh! Oof! Ow! Arghhhh!
</P>
<P>
   That hurt, but don't worry. Extracting the painful truth is the
practical man's favorite pastime, and here's what he pulled out
today: The Olympics isn't about sports. It's not about ``human
drama.'' It's not about ``being the best you can be,'' or
``overcoming the odds,'' or any of that hokey bull they blare on
TV.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics is about war. It's weeny, watered-down war, but
it's war all the same _ and here's the kicker: We like it that way.
Nations can't wait to fly their colors, trumpet their fight songs
and pretend to send their champions onto the gory field to compete
for global dominance. And, heck yeah, we love the bloodless battles
because we get to see how our clan stacks up against potential
enemies _ without risking any real harm.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least we used to love them. We used to think it meant
something if the U.S. hockey team stomped the Russkies. We used to
get a jolt of comfort when our big, strapping boys whupped up on
those little Asian guys. We used to get worried when those
stone-cold European blondies marched over our hapless heroes. We
used to think the medal count pointed to some larger truth because
we used to think the Olympics resonated far beyond sports.
</P>
<P>
   But not anymore. For the U.S., the war's over. We won. We don't
seriously consider any other nation a threat, and so from our lofty
perch as the world's Big Daddy, The Games have become mere games.
And as games _ let's face it _ they stink. As games, they're just a
bunch of goofball, graybeard, gym-class mumbo jumbo that's just too
boring to watch. As games, in short, they're not even football, and
we all know how riveting that is.

`THE CIRCLE': TABOOS AND PANIC CONFRONTING WOMEN IN IRAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jafar Panahi's first feature, ``The White Balloon,''
released in the United States in 1995 after its debut at the New
York Film Festival, was among the first products of the Iranian new
wave to reach a wide and enthusiastic audience in the West. That
film, the delicate, charming tale of a 7-year-old girl's search,
through the workaday bustle of Tehran, for the perfect pet
goldfish, showcased what have come to be seen as the hallmarks of
contemporary Iranian cinema: a sensitive, unsentimental interest in
childhood, extensive use of the outdoors and nonprofessional
actors, and an approach to storytelling at once straightforward and
elliptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Circle,'' which has been banned by the Iranian
authorities, is more ambitious and unsettling, and it announces the
presence of a tougher, more overtly political style of filmmaking.
While it shares the earlier film's narrative clarity and formal
precision as well as its feel for the bustle and surprise of daily
life, it focuses with unflinching candor on some of the harsher
aspects of life in that Islamic republic.
</P>
<P>
   The first scene shows an older woman's reaction to the news of
her granddaughter's birth, a reaction that passes from denial to
chagrin without stopping at joy. ``The ultrasound said it was going
to be a boy,'' she complains to the nurse. ``Now the in-laws will
insist on a divorce.'' Her scene of distress is a thematic prelude
to what follows. As she leaves the hospital, the woman passes a
group of three younger women huddled around a pay phone, and the
camera, as if distracted, stays with them. (The technique is
reminiscent of Richard Linklater's ``Slacker.'')
</P>
<P>
   For reasons that emerge only gradually and obliquely, the three
women are in a state of agitation and panic, hiding behind parked
cars when the police are in the area, darting into alleyways,
hastily throwing chadors over their heads and shoulders. They seem
to be in flight, though from what threat and toward what refuge
remains mysterious; we know before long that they, like many of the
women they meet in their peregrinations, have spent time in prison,
but we never find out why.
</P>
<P>
   Their chance separations, reunions and encounters with strangers
and old friends give ``The Circle'' a syncopated, anxious narrative
rhythm. The most vulnerable is Nargess (Nargess Mamizadeh), who has
a livid purple bruise under her left eye. She is desperate to
return to her home in the countryside, which she believes is
depicted in the reproduction of a van Gogh painting she discovers
while wandering through the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   She is sheltered for a while by the big-sisterly solicitude of
Arezou (Maryam Parvin Almani), but one of the film's discoveries is
that women in trouble can do very little to help one another.
</P>
<P>
   Arezou, Nargess and Pari (Fereshteh Sadr Orafai), who vanishes
early in the film only to reappear, running for her life, in its
last third, are not presented simply as victims of society's
cruelty to women. The film is startlingly forthright about the
problems they face, and not only by Iranian standards. With great
tact and sympathy, and without ever resorting to melodrama, Panahi
stares at what, in any society, are uncomfortable, even taboo
subjects: abortion, prostitution, family violence, the abandonment
of children. The political implications of the film are manifest,
as is the quiet courage of making it, but you never have the sense
that Panahi is stacking the deck or making an argument. His method
is investigative rather than didactic, and his bravery arises from
the bracing conviction that it is necessary and possible for an
artist simply to tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not so simply. One of the deepest impressions ``The
Circle'' leaves is of the terrifying but also in its way thrilling
complexity of experience. If the film declines to pass judgment on
Pari, Arezou and Nargess, it also refuses to condescend to them by
assuming their innocence. The three principal actresses give
remarkably open performances; their faces (which, given Iranian
standards of propriety, are all they have to work with) are alive
with emotions that compensate for the gaps in the story. Mamizadeh,
a nonprofessional still in her late teens when the movie was made,
is especially amazing in a scene where, for reasons destined to
remain opaque, she buys a man's shirt at a shop in the bus
terminal. The intimations of pleasure and fear that play across her
features are simply magical. Orafai, who also appeared in ``The
White Balloon,'' possesses a sensuous, mournful dignity that
recalls Ingrid Bergman in her prime. Pari's life history is treated
more fully than the lives of her companions, and she remains
strong-willed and good-humored even as she veers inexorably toward
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, it is unacceptable for a woman to smoke a cigarette in
public, a circumstance that Panahi uses both as a symbol of
repression and a poignant, sometimes comic motif. First Arezou and
then Pari, even as they are embroiled in more serious quests,
expend a lot of time and anxiety in the frustrated search for a
safe place to smoke. When, near the end, a prostitute on her way to
jail finally lights up, it's a moment worthy of 1940s Hollywood, a
small, ephemeral but in its way heroic declaration of freedom, and
therefore the perfect expression of this film's resilient spirit.  &QL;

 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In Seattle, an e-commerce start-up is looking for an Internet
Code Warrior. In San Francisco, a high-technology company needs an
XML Guru. In Albany, a computer maker has an opening for an
E-Commerce Solution Architect.
</P>
<P>
   Those job titles, from a recent batch of electronic help-wanted
ads, are at once grandiose and vague, designed to suggest the
limitless possibilities of careers in cyberspace. In a labor market
so tight that stock options and BMWs elicit a yawn, some personnel
managers hope that titles with a little panache will give them an
edge.
</P>
<P>
   Exotic job titles have been part of cyberspace culture since the
beginning, before computer geeks were masters of the universe and
were simply looking for respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weird titles are so much the norm in Silicon Valley that after
you've been here for any time at all, you stop noticing it,'' said
Paul Saffo, director of the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The practice began at Apple Computer in the mid-1980s, he said.
Everyone was allowed to have two business cards, one with a formal
title and the other with any title they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Titles were more entertaining then, Saffo said. One Apple
employee called himself Director/Off-Planet Operations. But after a
junior employee put ``chairman'' on his second card, Apple put
limits on the practice, he added.
</P>
<P>
   One of the earliest and most creative titles belonged to Guy
Kawasaki, who was known as Apple's ``Software Evangelist,'' when
the company was struggling for a share of the evolving personal
computer marketplace. Kawasaki joined Apple in 1983, when the
Macintosh PC was viewed as innovative but too slow for business
users.
</P>
<P>
   His job was to use the fervor of a missionary to persuade
software developers to write programs for the machines. Since then,
others have used the term, and others like it, but they have become
so commonplace that they now have little meaning, Saffo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first man to compare his lover's lips to a rose was quite
possibly a genius, but the second one and everyone after that were
quite certainly not.''
</P>
<P>
   Titles like ``visionary'' came into being because in
cyberspace's early days, people saw themselves as having a broader
mission than the ordinary worker, said Jan English Lueck, the
chairwoman of the anthropology department at San Jose State
University in California. ``It's very closely linked to a world
view that they're doing higher work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many in the computer industry do not take themselves
quite so seriously.
</P>
<P>
   At America Online, David Baker, a graphic designer, was known as
the Vice President of Cool in the mid-1990s. His job was to think
of ``cool and interesting ways'' to present the company's site to
users, said Tricia Primrose, a spokeswoman for America Online. And
Russ Leatherman, the voice and president of AOL Moviefone, is
commonly known as Moviefone.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the English language just does not contain words
adequate to describe what's happening in cyberspace, and so, it
would seem, new words must be invented. One is ``cybrarian,'' which
has forced its way into some acceptance. No less staid a body than
the American Library Association has begun publishing a
``Cybrarian's Manual,'' with sections on ``cyberciting'' and
``civic cybrarianship.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Geller Ettenheim, who holds the title of cybrarian at
Cybergrrl Inc., said she was a combination of librarian and
Internet specialist. Her services are available through
www.femina.com, a directory of international links to Web sites for
women.
</P>
<P>
   But some job recruiters offer a warning to companies tempted to
get too creative with job titles: potential employees may not know
what you're talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simpler you make the title, the more likely you are to
attract a candidate,'' said David Garcia, a recruiter for Hall
Kinion, an information technology employment firm in Cupertino,
Calif. Someone searching for a job as a senior software engineer is
likely to search using those key words, he said. If the position is
advertised as a ``guru,'' the applicant may never see it.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Garcia said, the title should be
comprehensible. He said he once tried to fill a company's request
for a ``product manager for syndicated services,'' but no one was
able to explain what that was. ``I have no idea. I never did know.
And they wanted someone with two to three years' experience.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as he knows, Garcia said, the company is still looking.

 By RON FEEMSTER  
 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   When Mallinckrodt Inc., a St. Louis-based health-care company,
sought Food and Drug Administration approval for a diagnostic
medical dye in 1998, it had to submit 198 volumes documenting its
clinical tests _ in duplicate. Each book was 2 inches to 3 inches
thick, and the company needed a truck to haul them to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA wants to dispense with all that paper by 2002, by
accepting applications for new drug approvals online. Because the
clinical-testing phase of new treatments can last for years,
companies such as Mallinckrodt are eager to convert paper
documentation trails into electronic archives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really enthusiastic about this,'' says Dr. Ray Schmelter,
the company's senior director of medical affairs. ``As we do more
and more tests on more and more patients, we can get buried in our
own paper.''
</P>
<P>
   But digging out involves some hard decisions. Mallinckrodt can
buy software and ask consultants to help customize it to handle a
particular set of drug trials, or the company can rent a Web-based
software solution such as those offered by EnMed Inc., a
Burlington, Mass.-based company that manages the flow of
information and documents from data entry by medical technicians to
the transmission of a finished report to the FDA
</P>
<P>
   EnMed did not create its software from scratch. It customized
the document-management programs of Documentum, a company in
Pleasanton, Calif., that also sells software directly to end users.
</P>
<P>
   FDA regulations require that every entry in a patient's file,
even the correction of a typographical error, be dated, and that
the person who changed the entry be identified in the file. EnMed
assigns each user a password and keeps track of such changes. When
the reporting phase begins, it creates links to databases and
raw-data entries to help FDA readers move more quickly through the
document.
</P>
<P>
   ``That information is there on paper,'' Schmelter says. ``But
you might have to go from volume to volume to track it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Mallinckrodt does enlist EnMed's services, the manufacturer
will pay a monthly fee for each individual user. EnMed, whose
business model is sometimes referred to as an application service
provider, or A.S.P., varies its fees based on user access.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to cutting costs,'' Schmelter says, ``we want to
reduce the clinical-cycle time as much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   He sees a future in which clinical-report forms will be replaced
by online entries, a great advantage when patients are scattered
across a large geographical area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Net data can be retrieved in real time, instead of sending
people to audit the results,'' he says. ``We can clean data as we
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial industries from Wall Street to Main Street face
similar issues, particularly as state and federal regulations
increase the pressures to keep track of e-mail messages and
electronic documents.
</P>
<P>
   SEC Regulation 17a-4, for example, requires that brokerage firms
keep every communication with each client in an easily accessible,
tamperproof archive for at least three years _ much longer, if a
broker leaves the firm. Such communications, which must also be
filed with a third party, are increasingly likely to be in the form
of e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   Zantaz.com, of Pleasanton, Calif., has become a third-party
archiver for the online-trading industry. Capturing, archiving and
retrieving the data, however, are only parts of the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zantaz helps us satisfy our compliance requirements,'' says
Tom Bevilacqua, a spokesman for ETrade. ``But, maybe as important
from a customer-service requirement, being able to quickly recall
customer e-mails is a huge value-added feature that we rely upon.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Schank, a Zantaz spokesman, added: ``Some of the
cyber-documents never really exist. It's just data sent through an
HTML page. So we not only archive things you think of as documents
_ e-mail, attachments and so on _ but also transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   Zantaz uses optical-storage media known as WORM disks _ it
stands for ``Write Once Read Many'' _ which are mentioned in the
SEC rules. The company says it ``e-staples'' related documents
together and stores everything in a ``digital safe.'' In the near
future, Schank says, individual consumers might rent space in a
digital safe in addition to keeping a safe-deposit box.
</P>
<P>
   Banks and credit unions have been scanning and digitizing
documents for years to reduce their paper archives. Unlike the
securities and pharmaceutical industries, however, they can't quite
do without paper yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``For binding legal documents, signatures still need to be made
on paper,'' says Diane Latine, director of optical services at
United Datatronics Inc., based in Tallahassee, Fla. United
Datatronics uses software by OTG, of Bethesda, Md., to provide
records-management services to five local credit unions.
</P>
<P>
   But when the binding digital signature arrives, Latine says,
paper may be history. Once a loan document has been created, it is
digitized and stored in a ``jukebox'' of CDs. The loan officers who
deal with customers after the initial paperwork is completed can
call up the digital copy without leaving their desks.
</P>
<P>
   Regulations allow records of paid-off loans to be destroyed
after five or six years. The real backlog of paper is in mortgages,
which stay active for 30 years or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've scanned 1 million documents for our clients since
1996,'' Latine says. ``And one of our credit unions has barely
touched its loan portfolio.''

<P>
   In Seattle, an e-commerce start-up is looking for an Internet
Code Warrior. In San Francisco, a high-technology company needs an
XML Guru. In Albany, a computer maker has an opening for an
E-Commerce Solution Architect.
</P>
<P>
   Those job titles, from a recent batch of electronic help-wanted
ads, are at once grandiose and vague, designed to suggest the
limitless possibilities of careers in cyberspace. In a labor market
so tight that stock options and BMWs elicit a yawn, some personnel
managers hope that titles with a little panache will give them an
edge.
</P>
<P>
   Exotic job titles have been part of cyberspace culture since the
beginning, before computer geeks were masters of the universe and
were simply looking for respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weird titles are so much the norm in Silicon Valley that after
you've been here for any time at all, you stop noticing it,'' said
Paul Saffo, director of the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The practice began at Apple Computer in the mid-1980s, he said.
Everyone was allowed to have two business cards, one with a formal
title and the other with any title they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Titles were more entertaining then, Saffo said. One Apple
employee called himself Director/Off-Planet Operations. But after a
junior employee put ``chairman'' on his second card, Apple put
limits on the practice, he added.
</P>
<P>
   One of the earliest and most creative titles belonged to Guy
Kawasaki, who was known as Apple's ``Software Evangelist,'' when
the company was struggling for a share of the evolving personal
computer marketplace. Kawasaki joined Apple in 1983, when the
Macintosh PC was viewed as innovative but too slow for business
users.
</P>
<P>
   His job was to use the fervor of a missionary to persuade
software developers to write programs for the machines. Since then,
others have used the term, and others like it, but they have become
so commonplace that they now have little meaning, Saffo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first man to compare his lover's lips to a rose was quite
possibly a genius, but the second one and everyone after that were
quite certainly not.''
</P>
<P>
   Titles like ``visionary'' came into being because in
cyberspace's early days, people saw themselves as having a broader
mission than the ordinary worker, said Jan English Lueck, the
chairwoman of the anthropology department at San Jose State
University in California. ``It's very closely linked to a world
view that they're doing higher work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many in the computer industry do not take themselves
quite so seriously.
</P>
<P>
   At America Online, David Baker, a graphic designer, was known as
the Vice President of Cool in the mid-1990s. His job was to think
of ``cool and interesting ways'' to present the company's site to
users, said Tricia Primrose, a spokeswoman for America Online. And
Russ Leatherman, the voice and president of AOL Moviefone, is
commonly known as Moviefone.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the English language just does not contain words
adequate to describe what's happening in cyberspace, and so, it
would seem, new words must be invented. One is ``cybrarian,'' which
has forced its way into some acceptance. No less staid a body than
the American Library Association has begun publishing a
``Cybrarian's Manual,'' with sections on ``cyberciting'' and
``civic cybrarianship.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Geller Ettenheim, who holds the title of cybrarian at
Cybergrrl Inc., said she was a combination of librarian and
Internet specialist. Her services are available through
www.femina.com, a directory of international links to Web sites for
women.
</P>
<P>
   But some job recruiters offer a warning to companies tempted to
get too creative with job titles: potential employees may not know
what you're talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simpler you make the title, the more likely you are to
attract a candidate,'' said David Garcia, a recruiter for Hall
Kinion, an information technology employment firm in Cupertino,
Calif. Someone searching for a job as a senior software engineer is
likely to search using those key words, he said. If the position is
advertised as a ``guru,'' the applicant may never see it.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Garcia said, the title should be
comprehensible. He said he once tried to fill a company's request
for a ``product manager for syndicated services,'' but no one was
able to explain what that was. ``I have no idea. I never did know.
And they wanted someone with two to three years' experience.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as he knows, Garcia said, the company is still looking.

 &HT;    (ART ADV: A picture of the Web site Zantaz.com is available in

 By RON FEEMSTER  
 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   When Mallinckrodt Inc., a St. Louis-based health-care company,
sought Food and Drug Administration approval for a diagnostic
medical dye in 1998, it had to submit 198 volumes documenting its
clinical tests _ in duplicate. Each book was 2 inches to 3 inches
thick, and the company needed a truck to haul them to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA wants to dispense with all that paper by 2002, by
accepting applications for new drug approvals online. Because the
clinical-testing phase of new treatments can last for years,
companies such as Mallinckrodt are eager to convert paper
documentation trails into electronic archives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really enthusiastic about this,'' says Dr. Ray Schmelter,
the company's senior director of medical affairs. ``As we do more
and more tests on more and more patients, we can get buried in our
own paper.''
</P>
<P>
   But digging out involves some hard decisions. Mallinckrodt can
buy software and ask consultants to help customize it to handle a
particular set of drug trials, or the company can rent a Web-based
software solution such as those offered by EnMed Inc., a
Burlington, Mass.-based company that manages the flow of
information and documents from data entry by medical technicians to
the transmission of a finished report to the FDA
</P>
<P>
   EnMed did not create its software from scratch. It customized
the document-management programs of Documentum, a company in
Pleasanton, Calif., that also sells software directly to end users.
</P>
<P>
   FDA regulations require that every entry in a patient's file,
even the correction of a typographical error, be dated, and that
the person who changed the entry be identified in the file. EnMed
assigns each user a password and keeps track of such changes. When
the reporting phase begins, it creates links to databases and
raw-data entries to help FDA readers move more quickly through the
document.
</P>
<P>
   ``That information is there on paper,'' Schmelter says. ``But
you might have to go from volume to volume to track it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Mallinckrodt does enlist EnMed's services, the manufacturer
will pay a monthly fee for each individual user. EnMed, whose
business model is sometimes referred to as an application service
provider, or A.S.P., varies its fees based on user access.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to cutting costs,'' Schmelter says, ``we want to
reduce the clinical-cycle time as much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   He sees a future in which clinical-report forms will be replaced
by online entries, a great advantage when patients are scattered
across a large geographical area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Net data can be retrieved in real time, instead of sending
people to audit the results,'' he says. ``We can clean data as we
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial industries from Wall Street to Main Street face
similar issues, particularly as state and federal regulations
increase the pressures to keep track of e-mail messages and
electronic documents.
</P>
<P>
   SEC Regulation 17a-4, for example, requires that brokerage firms
keep every communication with each client in an easily accessible,
tamperproof archive for at least three years _ much longer, if a
broker leaves the firm. Such communications, which must also be
filed with a third party, are increasingly likely to be in the form
of e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   Zantaz.com, of Pleasanton, Calif., has become a third-party
archiver for the online-trading industry. Capturing, archiving and
retrieving the data, however, are only parts of the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zantaz helps us satisfy our compliance requirements,'' says
Tom Bevilacqua, a spokesman for ETrade. ``But, maybe as important
from a customer-service requirement, being able to quickly recall
customer e-mails is a huge value-added feature that we rely upon.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Schank, a Zantaz spokesman, added: ``Some of the
cyber-documents never really exist. It's just data sent through an
HTML page. So we not only archive things you think of as documents
_ e-mail, attachments and so on _ but also transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   Zantaz uses optical-storage media known as WORM disks _ it
stands for ``Write Once Read Many'' _ which are mentioned in the
SEC rules. The company says it ``e-staples'' related documents
together and stores everything in a ``digital safe.'' In the near
future, Schank says, individual consumers might rent space in a
digital safe in addition to keeping a safe-deposit box.
</P>
<P>
   Banks and credit unions have been scanning and digitizing
documents for years to reduce their paper archives. Unlike the
securities and pharmaceutical industries, however, they can't quite
do without paper yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``For binding legal documents, signatures still need to be made
on paper,'' says Diane Latine, director of optical services at
United Datatronics Inc., based in Tallahassee, Fla. United
Datatronics uses software by OTG, of Bethesda, Md., to provide
records-management services to five local credit unions.
</P>
<P>
   But when the binding digital signature arrives, Latine says,
paper may be history. Once a loan document has been created, it is
digitized and stored in a ``jukebox'' of CDs. The loan officers who
deal with customers after the initial paperwork is completed can
call up the digital copy without leaving their desks.
</P>
<P>
   Regulations allow records of paid-off loans to be destroyed
after five or six years. The real backlog of paper is in mortgages,
which stay active for 30 years or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've scanned 1 million documents for our clients since
1996,'' Latine says. ``And one of our credit unions has barely
touched its loan portfolio.''

A STRING OF STARS FOR ISAAC STERN'S 80TH BIRTHDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Deciding evidently that one evening would not do,
Carnegie Hall took a weekend to celebrate Isaac Stern's 80th
birthday. On Saturday there were films. Sunday was packed with
family concerts. The Miro and Aviv String Quartets played at Weill
Recital Hall. Distinguished soloists, singers and members of the
New York Philharmonic were everywhere. And a long tribute _ a
parade of youth and celebrity _ serenaded Stern on Sunday evening.
Two of his sons conducted; a daughter spoke.
</P>
<P>
   A performer is by nature a public person, but Isaac Stern has
been more public than most. In his prime he was a violinist known
for powerful musicianship and an unadulterated sense of style. As a
civic activist, he prominently figured in saving of Carnegie Hall
from demolition 40 years ago and became its president. As a teacher
of individuals and chamber groups he has had the gift of avoiding
vague generalizations and empty rhetoric and addressing the
problems of learning acutely and specifically. Stern had serious
heart surgery barely a month ago, but he was present in a
first-tier box with his family on Sunday, frail yet happily
attentive.
</P>
<P>
   His colleague Leonard Bernstein came up more than once. Glenn
Dicterow was the splendid violinist in two movements from the
Serenade; Betty Comden and Adolph Green made boisterous appearances
in show tunes. Sarah Chang, Sharon Robinson and Joseph Kalichstein
did the first movement of the Beethoven Triple Concerto with great
sureness. A group heavy with members of the Guarneri and Juilliard
Quartets played two movements of Mendelssohn's E flat Octet.
Supporting the bigger pieces was the Symphony Orchestra of the
Curtis Institute of Music, a tight and elegant young ensemble that
David and Michael Stern conducted to great effect.
</P>
<P>
   Such events hover by nature between the carefully prepared and
the ad hoc, and some moments seem better rehearsed than others. It
would not be generous to dwell on the mismatch of Midori and
Pinchas Zukerman in two movements from Mozart's Sinfonia
Concertante for violin and viola: Midori with her slim, penetrating
music next to Zukerman's big bear-hug approach to Classical style.
If Yefim Bronfman and Leon Fleisher had a few balance problems of
their own in Schubert's D major Rondo for piano four hands, we have
to remember that this wonderful music (especially as played by
musicians this good) is best celebrated in a private not a public
place.
</P>
<P>
   Easily the evening's most satisfying music came with its most
familiar item: ``The Swan'' from Saint-Saens' ``Carnival of the
Animals,'' played here with magisterial simplicity by Yo-Yo Ma,
cellist, and Emanuel Ax, pianist. Sir Peter Ustinov, himself nearly
80, delivered his own text to the Saint-Saens, prefacing it with a
comic riff on German musicology.
</P>
<P>
   With Carnegie Hall's executive director, Franz Xaver Ohnesorg,
cheerleading and directing traffic, a grand finale adapted Ernst
Toch's spoken ``Geographical Fugue'' to a new text that followed
Stern's long career. Kurt Masur, music director of the New York
Philharmonic, conducted the chorus of Carnegie staff members who
may have been the best prepared of Sunday's small army of
performers. Everyone crowded the stage at the end. Stern spoke
briefly. ``Happy Birthday'' was sung.

   POVERTY-POLITICS (Undated) _ Poor people learn to keep hopes
small. So when President Clinton came calling on some of the
poorest places in the country last year with ideas to make things
better, it was like rain in the desert. The president's six-state,
four-day poverty tour, highlighting for the first time in his two
terms the places that remain untouched by the longest economic boom
in this nation's history, caused an excitement that bordered on the
spiritual. A year later, the president's modest proposals for tax
incentives to bring businesses to impoverished communities are
still awaiting Senate approval. The idea that anything big might
happen to places that have been down longer than they were ever up
has long faded. In dozens of interviews in communities that the
president visited _ Clarksdale, East St. Louis and the Eastern
Kentucky towns of Hazard and Annville _ what was clear is that
Democrats are Democrats, Republicans are Republicans and people are
more concerned with how to fix their own communities than in the
state of the country. By Evelyn Nieves. (With photos NYT9-11)

   BLACK-ALUMNI (Cambridge, Mass.) _ Across the country, more and

ambivalent are being welcomed back for the first time with buffets
piled high with collard greens, fried chicken and grits. Here at
Harvard, the law school played host to a Sunday gospel brunch and

   BIOENGINEER-FOOD-LABELS (Undated) _ The discovery of an

store-bought taco shells is prompting new calls for the labeling of
bioengineered foods. But the case, which led Kraft Foods to
announce a nationwide recall on Friday, also offers a foretaste of
some of the practical difficulties involved in such labeling. Among
the questions are the reliability of testing, the degree to which
conventional grains and foods can feasibly be kept separate from
those that are genetically modified and even the definition of
genetically modified food. By Andrew Pollack.

SENIOR CRUISE: AVERAGE AGE, 64.1 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 1)  
 By BARBARA DELATINER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was tempting. Six cities in 12 days, unpacking only once? Add
two days in London and it was even more inviting. Especially since
this tour-cruise to four Scandinavian capitals, St. Petersburg and
an optional side trip to Berlin was for ``experienced travelers.''
Make that ``mature,'' the brochure amended, using an adjective that
describes me better than ``experienced.'' Although I had never
before been on a cruise _ unless two nights aboard an informal
small ship gliding along Glacier Bay in Alaska qualifies _ or
vacationed on an organized tour, this Grand Circle Travel trip with
12 days aboard the Norwegian Cruise Line's Norwegian Dream looked
too good to pass up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But me? A nongambler who didn't dance and hated to dress up?
Would I take to the whole culture of cruising: the three nights of
formal dress, the potentially seductive (and destructive)
round-the-clock eating and, even, just sitting around watching the
ocean go by?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Could this if-this-is-Tuesday-it-must-be-Copenhagen trip (the
kind I always poked fun at in my more mobile youth and before knee
replacement surgery two years ago) satisfy my normal curiosity
about people and places, provide anything more than a fleeting
glimpse of fabled cities?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Would traveling with a group of my age peers be like spending
two weeks in a retirement home?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite these concerns I signed on for a tour in June. Grand
Circle Travel of Boston, begun in 1958 by the founder of the
American Association of Retired Persons, came highly recommended.
According to one of my two traveling companions, it provided fine
accommodations and stimulating, stress-free land tours run by
knowledgeable guides and, frequently, accompanying academics.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The trip got off to a good start at Heathrow in London, where
smiling Grand Circle representatives shepherded travelers wearing
official CGT badges to waiting buses that would take us and our
CGT-tagged luggage to the upscale Tower Thistle Hotel. Because the
hotel is far from the center of the city, sandwiched between the
Tower of London and a posh marina-housing development on the
Thames, Grand Circle provided hourly bus transportation to and from
the British Museum. This was in addition to breakfasts and a city
sightseeing tour _ with one of those knowledgeable guides _ that
were part of the package.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On our own, my friends and I set the stage for what we hoped
would be great things to come, with a night of theater we had
booked on the Internet (Maggie Smith in ``The Lady in the Van''),
dinner at a chic Piccadilly restaurant I had discovered on a
previous trip, and visits to places like the new Tate Modern and
the British Museum. On the morning of the third day all 148 of the
Grand Circle travelers from 23 states boarded our assigned buses
for the trip south to Dover.
</P>
<P>
   With minimum effort _ and with GCT personnel again riding herd
on us and our luggage _ we boarded the ship and checked in. For
about $250 more than my friends paid, I had booked as a
``guaranteed single'' which meant that instead of paying a ``single
supplement'' for a specific cabin at almost twice the double rate,
I would get a stateroom that the Norwegian Cruise Line had not
sold. It turned out to be a pleasant surprise: in the center of the
sixth deck with a queen-sized bed, sitting area, color television
with free movies and CNN, plenty of closet space (for one), and a
small shower-bathroom with a hair dryer and the usual hotel goodies
replenished every day. Not surprisingly, it was an inside cabin,
and, without a window, eventually claustrophobic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By early afternoon all 1,800 passengers and 700 crew members
were on board and we set sail. The first two days were spent ocean
cruising: across the English Channel into the North Sea, through
the Kiel Canal (where in an amazing engineering feat, the ship's
mast and funnel were flipped over so we could pass under a series
of bridges) and into the Baltic Sea. Once I realized that all the
seasickness cures that cruise veterans had urged me to buy were
unnecessary, I tried to make the most of my floating home.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a tastefully furnished, 12-deck colossus with three
dining rooms that had two seatings for each meal; an intimate
bistro where the food and ambience were a notch above the usual
pleasant, if unexciting, fare; two informal cafeterias, one of
which was open 24 hours a day; ample sun decks where attendants
were always ready with lounges, towels, blankets for cold days,
and, of course, drinks; two small outdoor pools, for dunking, not
really swimming; a nightclub with nightly entertainment ranging
from an abbreviated version of ``Crazy for You'' to a concert by
``the world's fastest banjo player''; a gym with, I'm told, the
latest equipment; a health club where I indulged in three massages;
shops; cocktail lounges where ``gentlemen hosts'' were happy to
dance with unaccompanied females of a certain age, and a casino
where, in record time (three minutes once) I lost $10 a night on
the slot machines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The service, by a friendly international crew, was impeccable;
courteous to sometimes fawning, but never pushy. One could sit in
the nightclub or the cocktail lounges for an entire evening without
feeling pressure to buy a drink. Each evening, along with The GCT
Bulletin and a piece of chocolate, we received a Cruise News that
in addition to ordering us to turn our watches back or forward,
detailed the next day's nonstop activities aboard. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There were bridge, golf, ballroom dancing and gambling lessons;
craft workshops to learn how to make essentials like crepe-paper
roses; talks on each port of call by both ship and Grand Central
Travel personnel; shopping seminars; bingo; trivia contests (did
you know that at any given hour there are 61,000 planes in the air
over the United States?); and even sessions of exercise sitting
down. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere, from either the cruise line or GCT, both of which
issued copious amounts of descriptive materials about our stops,
was there anything beyond the obvious historical facts and shopping
hints. After once walking around the ship three and a half times to
collect a congratulatory Mile With a Smile citation, I read a lot. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But ostensibly we were on a ship that was to take us to see the
sights on land. Long before we left on the trip, we had received a
list of available shore excursions. Although two program directors
accompanied us to act as troubleshooters, gift givers to clients
marking birthdays or anniversaries, and hosts at a cocktail party,
Grand Central Travel, like other touring groups aboard, did not run
the land tours. They were offered by the Norwegian Cruise Line.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carefully plotting our limited time ashore, we signed up for
morning ``highlights'' tours of Helsinki, Stockholm, Copenhagen and
Oslo. That, we thought, would give us time on our own. For St.
Petersburg, to save the cost of getting visas and because we were
advised that going it alone was difficult, we booked two tours: an
evening trip to a suburb of the city to visit Pavlovsk, the summer
palace of Paul I, and a full-day tour of Classical St. Petersburg
that included the Hermitage.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We thought wrong. The advance itinerary was misleading since a
``day'' in port, we discovered, began as late as 9 a.m. and ended
at about 3:30 p.m. leaving us a scant hour or two to explore.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Independently, we did manage to have lunch in Helsinki and
wander through its lively waterfront market. On our night in
Copenhagen, we took a cab to the Tivoli Gardens for a relaxed
evening of big-band music and admiring the gardens and lights. With
the help of friendly passers-by, who in Scandinavia all seemed to
speak English, we managed a public bus to the Vasa Museum in
Stockholm to see a 17th-century warship that inexplicably sank soon
after its launching; it was reclaimed from the mud in 1961. It was,
we heard a British tourist say in a stage whisper, a peculiar
monument to failure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, though, we were limited to the impressions that
our native guides were programmed to share. True, some of these
impressions will last a lifetime. Like the superb chamber music
concert in the glow of a White Night summer evening in Pavlovsk. Or
the stunning mosaics that give name to the Golden Hall in
Stockholm's City Hall. Or the eccentric Vigeland Sculpture Garden
in Oslo with its 150 statue groups representing one artist's view
of humanity. Or the massive Baroque Christiansborg Palace in
Copenhagen where contemporary Gobelin tapestries tell the history
of Denmark in a thoroughly modern, sometimes abstract, way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But generally there was little time to soak up our surroundings
as we raced to and then in and out of sites. For instance, it's
hard enough to appreciate the badly hung and lighted works in the
Hermitage. It's almost impossible when you're allotted about five
seconds a painting.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   If the sightseeing was disappointing, the company I kept was
amiable _ and spry. It was not, as I had feared, like waiting in
line for early bird dinners in Florida. ``Mature'' covers a lot of
ground, of course, both physically and chronologically.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While there were some families and even honeymooners on board,
the vast majority of passengers were of an age; that age. We were
an average 64.1 years old, a cruise line spokeswoman said. My GCT
tour mates, an informal survey revealed, were retired professional
couples, with only a sprinkling of us single folk.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There were a few incidents reflecting the crankiness that can be
part of the senior mystique. Like the platinum blonde (those of us
with gray hair made up a distinct minority) who during an emergency
boat drill peevishly insisted that ``on the Holland American line
we did this in the dining room, not on the freezing deck.'' Several
of my fellow travelers were in their 80s and 90s and, with
accompanying deafness, often loud.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since the ship has staterooms for the handicapped, there were
travelers in wheelchairs. Some like me carried canes. To
accommodate everyone the tours had been rated with symbols denoting
``moderate walking over relatively level terrain'' or
``considerable walking and/or climbing.'' No one in authority,
however, apparently told the guides about these ratings. Wherever
we went we were led at a brisk clip with only occasional restroom
stops. The long lines at ladies' rooms made our young women guides
impatient. While this could have happened with any group, given our
age bracket it was especially irksome. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen days and about $7,000 later I was of several
contradictory minds. As reluctant as I am to confess it, I did
enjoy being waited on and pampered aboard ship. Once. More cruising
could prove boring to my psyche and harmful to my waistline.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite having to wear name tags and traveling in a pack, I
found that a tour was not as regimented as I had feared. Was it
less expensive? I thought so until I later learned that booking the
cruise directly from the Norwegian Cruise Line would have cost
slightly less.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I have to admit that covering so much ground in such a short
time would have been prohibitive physically. Having a cabin to
settle into certainly beats living out of a suitcase.
Paradoxically, the very accessibility that this cruise made
possible is what also made it so frustrating. Knowing a city after
even a week is doubtful; three hours is a mere tease.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting the formula just right is a puzzlement; one that, given
retirement, time and unlimited funds, I'd be happy to solve.

   SYDNEY, Australia _ Memo to Rosie O'Donnell:
</P>
<P>
   Book her.
</P>
<P>
   Book the kid who can handle over 300 pounds, as well as any
question you can throw at her.
</P>
<P>
   Book a bright, 17-year-old nicknamed ``Fun.'' A Georgia peach in
a pit of drugs. A woman-child who wonders what it would be like to
be thin, but also has come to embrace her own beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Book her, and it won't be hard to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Haworth says she dreams of being on ``Rosie.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the dream of celebrity. Haworth did ``The Today Show''
on Friday and has already small-talked with Regis and Leno.
</P>
<P>
   Hear how she used to drag felled pines back in Savannah _ to
build tree houses at age 10?
</P>
<P>
   Regis loved it.
</P>
<P>
   Hear how she likes to move cars around the school parking lot?
Hear how ... there's more, starting at the beginning, when Haworth
won a beauty pageant when she was 3.
</P>
<P>
   After that, her body had other ideas. She grew as she played a
lot of basketball and softball, and she says she began to
understand she was different than her friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I was stronger than other people,'' she said. ``When
the catcher was blocking the plate, it was no problem to run right
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Leno loved it.
</P>
<P>
   Training for softball, she lifted some weights. At 13, she was
hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like something I could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, only two women in the world can lift more. She
won the bronze medal in weightlifting, and there's always the
chance she could finish higher in this, the Darryl Strawberry of
Olympic sports.
</P>
<P>
   As the Bulgarians like to say: Urine one day, you're out the
next.
</P>
<P>
   Haworth, however, could only be guilty of illegal grits. She's a
natural lifter with natural power and, given different
circumstances, maybe she could have challenged the Chinese woman
who won gold.
</P>
<P>
   But making sure they locked into a medal, U.S. coaches
instructed Haworth to lift lighter loads. So she won the bronze
while making all six lifts easily, smiling broadly after each.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certain I could have done more,'' she said. There will be
time for that. When she's 21, in 2004 in Athens, she will still be
considered a baby in this sport.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more than her bulk, or even her astounding athletic
ability (24-inch vertical jump and 5.5 speed in the 40). When the
questions come at her about her size, delicately asked but still
pointed, she shrugs and responds as few teens could.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't let it bother me,'' she says of her weight. ``I'm good
natured about it. When I go talk to kids about weightlifting,
that's the first thing they ask me. `How much do you weigh?'''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, it's 304 pounds and counting. It's the first
thing everyone wants to know, and America wondered, too, when it
tuned into the opening ceremonies and saw Haworth in a USA uniform.
</P>
<P>
   But she moves through crowds with more balance than Bela's
pixies, and certainly more than France's Perec. When she isn't
trading barbs with her coach, she's sketching her teammates. Still
in high school, she wants to pursue art in college.
</P>
<P>
   She's ``Fun,'' all right.
</P>
<P>
   And so when the questions came _ questions that wouldn't be
asked of other competitors _ she didn't blink. No, she doesn't get
asked out for dates. Yes, she eats what she wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to be small,'' she said. ``I'm trying to be
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, when asked about beauty, she said she hopes to ``show some
people they aren't finished looking for what makes them happy.''
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. publicist, Christine Hyde, smiled nearby when she heard
that. It had to do with Rosie.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde says Rosie is a role model for Haworth because Rosie, too,
``is not a perfect size 2.'' Rosie made Haworth feel good about
herself, and now Haworth wants to be for others what Rosie was for
her.
</P>
<P>
   Another memo to Rosie:
</P>
<P>
   How can you not book her?

disc, he was suspicious that she was simply jumping on the
Latin-music bandwagon, currently helmed by Ricky Martin and Enrique
Iglesias.
</P>
<P>
   Then Burr, a well-respected music reporter for the San Antonio
Express-News who has written about Latin music for 10 years, heard
the record, titled ``Mi Reflejo;'' he was quickly won over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid's got talent,'' Burr says of Aguilera, who will
perform Saturday at the State Fair of Texas in Dallas. ``I think
that, yes, if one wanted to be a cynic, they could say she was out
to make money strictly off the bandwagon. But she's got so much
versatility, power, soul and flavor, she could be singing in French
and have the same appeal. I think this a great record.''
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera and her army of record company personnel are hoping the
rest of the Latin community will think so, too.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera's expansion into Latin music is certainly a risk _ an
experiment that could expand her career, or, if she fails, turn it
into a joke. Throughout the history of pop music, well-established
Latin singers have sought to widen their appeal by crossing over
into U.S. territory, from Menudo to Martin to Enrique and Julio
Iglesias. Next up is Shakira, a young Latin singer who is huge in
Mexico but almost unknown beyond her homeland's borders; the recent
Latin Grammy winner will release her all-English debut next year.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera has decided to go in the opposite direction. Thanks to
the sale of millions of copies of her self-titled 1999 debut, the
singer is already a major star in the United States, making
entertainment headlines by day, playing to sold-out audiences by
night. And though she's just now learning to speak Spanish, she's
betting that her Hispanic heritage will give her a leg up in the
rapidly expanding Latin music scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it makes perfect sense for her to do this right
now,'' says Jose Valle, vice president and general manager of
Dallas Hispanic Broadcasting Corporation Group, which owns several
Spanish-oriented radio stations in North Texas. ``The United States
population is changing. There's a much larger Spanish population
here now, and it keeps growing, which means the Latin music scene
will, too. So, in a way, she's working toward the future.''
</P>
<P>
   But Aguilera isn't just interested in reaching Hispanics in the
United States. She's one of the first chart-topping American
artists to recognize that although the huge U.S. market is the holy
grail for performers the world over, it's not the only major market
anymore. Ricky Martin didn't need to top the charts in the United
States to be a huge star; his success throughout the '90s in Latin
America _ with its 500 million population _ was greater than it
probably ever will be in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera, however, says that potential sales south of the border
aside, she is simply paying homage to her roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very cool for me personally, because it gives me a chance
to explore my Latin side,'' Aguilera said in a prepared statement
(recent throat problems prevented her from doing interviews, her
publicist says). ``(It's) something I've wanted to do for a long
time, even before I was signed. I love the Spanish language. (It)
opens up a whole new musical arena for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks after the record's Sept. 12 release, there
are already signs that she's succeeding. The album debuted at No. 1
on Billboard's Latin chart, which reflects U.S. sales. Ans on the
heels of a critically lauded performance on the Latin Grammys
recently, ``Mi Reflejo's'' flagship single, ``Ven Conmigo'' (a
Spanish version of ``Come on Over Baby''), is doing well on Spanish
radio, says her producer, Rudy Perez, and the record is selling
well in Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latin American audiences love her,'' he says. ``I think she
could do just as well over there as Ricky did over here.''
</P>
<P>
   But John Ortiz, director of promotion for record company EMI
Latin, sees it in a different light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think she's in the same boat as Ricky,'' he says. ``I
don't expect to see the boom we saw with him. What a lot of people
don't realize is that he was such a superstar in Latin communities,
he already had a fan base over here within those communities.
Christina doesn't have that there. It's going to take a lot more
work.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Perez is perhaps Christina Aguilera's biggest fan _ and
defender. On the phone from his Miami Beach, Fla., recording
studio, where the bulk of ``Mi Reflejo'' was banged out, Perez says
Aguilera's all-Spanish disc was not the result of her or her label
wanting to cash in on her current popularity, but that Aguilera
simply wanted to do a Spanish effort to pay homage to her family
and heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel one of the reasons she did this was for her
grandparents and father,'' he says. ``She also wants to connect
with her Latin roots.''

RAOUL BERGER, 99; LAW SCHOLAR  
 PIQUED OPINIONS ON JUDICIAL RESTRAINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raoul Berger of Concord, Mass., a well-known constitutional
scholar whose legal writings helped undermine President Nixon's
claims of executive privilege, died at home Saturday. He was 99.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, who was born in Russia and brought to Chicago by his
parents at the age of 4, did not become a lawyer until he was 34.
He published seven books on constitutional law and more than 100
law review articles. He was actively writing and publishing into
his 97th year.
</P>
<P>
   His central legal thesis _ the principle of judicial restraint _
made him a frequent target in recent years of liberal scholars and
defenders of the court's jurisprudence under Chief Justice Earl
Warren.
</P>
<P>
   But many of those same people had embraced Mr. Berger during the
Watergate years, when they used his two books _ ``Executive
Privilege'' published in 1974 and ``Impeachment'' in 1973 _ to
bolster their arguments that Nixon had no constitutional right to
keep government matters secret from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Berger argued that impeachment did not require an indictable
crime, but was satisfied by abuse of an office. In his treatise on
executive privilege, he contends that the president's power as
commander-in-chief was subject to Congress's power to declare and
make war, and that the chief executive had no monopoly on foreign
relations.
</P>
<P>
   That same principle of judicial restraint also led him to
conclude that the far-reaching decisions of the Warren court _ from
abortion to one-man one-vote _ were inconsistent with the
intentions of the framers of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony is that he hated many of his conclusions no less
than did his critics,'' Charles J. Cooper, then a top Justice
Department lawyer, wrote in 1987 in a tribute to Mr. Berger. ``But
he loved the truth more than he hated his conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Mr. Berger always considered himself a liberal. His wife
Patricia Wolcott Berger, a well-known author of children's books,
said he relished the public debates he created with his
publications and his views.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raoul loved to roll up his sleeves and engage his critics,''
she said. ``He felt so strongly about his point of view, and he was
not afraid to stand up for it. He loved the controversies.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of his life was devoted to the law, Mr. Berger's
first profession _ and lifelong passion _ was the violin.
</P>
<P>
   He studied the violin in New York and Berlin and at the Curtis
School in Philadelphia. During the 1920s, he played for the
Cleveland Orchestra and the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra. He
became second concert master in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   At age 26, he returned to school, earning his bachelor's degree
at the University of Cincinnati and a law degree at Northwestern
University, where he was admitted to the Order of the Coif. He also
received a master's degree from Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Before and after World War II, Mr. Berger worked in Washington
for various federal agencies, including the Securities and Exchange
Commission. He later practiced law privately in Washington until
1962, when he joined the law faculty at the University of
California at Berkeley. Several years later he returned east to
become the Charles Warren Senior Research Fellow in Legal History
at Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Berger once mused that he left music and chose the law
because the legal profession is a ``field so totally removed from
what aptitude I had shown.''
</P>
<P>
   His first wife, Helen Beck, whom he married in 1930, died in
1958.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, he leaves a son, Dr. Carl Berger of
Philadelphia, and two grandaughters. His daughter Andrea Berger
Kalodner, a lawyer in New York City, died several years ago.

&HT;     GORE PUSHES MEDICARE REFORM, BUSH STRESSES EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rival presidential candidates jockeyed Monday for an edge
heading into next week's first campaign debate, with Democrat Al
Gore showcasing a 74-page plan to overhaul Medicare  &Cx1f; and Republican
George W. Bush's campaign calling the document so fanciful that the
vice president is becoming ``the Hans Christian Andersen of
American politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore unveiled a detailed collection of campaign promises
entitled ``Medicare at a Crossroads'' at a campaign appearance in
Florida in an effort to cast himself as the defender of a popular
middle-class entitlement that provides federally subsidized
health-care coverage to nearly 40 million elderly and disabled
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll defend you _ and the other side won't,'' Gore told
several hundred cheering senior citizens and baby-boomers gathered
in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president vowed to punish any managed-care providers
that drop the elderly from coverage. He outlined his 10-year, $338
billion plan to cover the costs of prescription drugs. And he
pledged to set aside $400 billion from the projected 10-year, $4.6
trillion federal budget surplus to prolong Medicare's projected
solvency by five years to 2030.
</P>
<P>
   Gore took a swipe at Bush's rival $158-billion proposal to
provide prescription drug coverage to seniors through
private-market competition and federal subsides, saying the Texas
governor's plan ``leaves out millions of middle-class seniors,
varies in coverage from state to state and could run seniors
through welfare offices'' to obtain their benefits _ a path that
would ``violate their sense of dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer accused Gore of ``trying
to turn voters against Gov. Bush by scaring seniors.'' The Bush
campaign said in a statement that Gore's blueprint ``offers
accounting gimmicks, distortions and made-up facts'' about both
candidates' plans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett added: ``Given all the things he
made up last week and is making up today, Al Gore is quickly
becoming the Hans Christian Andersen of American politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett was referring to Gore's claim that his mother-in-law,
Margaret Ann Aitcheson, was paying nearly three times as much for a
prescription arthritis medication as the Gores pay for the
veterinary version of the same medication for their 14-year-old
Labrador retriever. It later turned out that Gore's statement was
based on a House Democratic study of prescription drug prices
rather than his own family's experience.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Christian Andersen was a legendary 19th century Danish
author of 156 fairy tales for children, including the Ugly Duckling
and The Little Mermaid.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore pressed his efforts to win the support of senior
citizens in Florida, an electoral prize with the highest proportion
of elderly in the nation, Bush sought the support of women voters
in Oregon and Washington state where he touted his $48 billion plan
to bolster locally-run public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the nation is ``in the midst of an education recession
that can threaten our very future'' because ``some schools have
shown stagnation and decline'' and too many schools are not meeting
the challenge'' of educating the next generation. Almost seven out
of 10 4th graders in inner-city schools can't read, Bush said,
adding that the Clinton-Gore administration was ``not strong enough
to reverse the slide.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush plan would boost spending on literacy programs and college
scholarships as well as provide federal money to states to improve
pupil achievement. If schools continued to fail after three years,
Bush's plan would provide parents $1,500 a year to help finance
private education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's emphasis on education in the Northwest accompanied the
launch of a 30-second television spot by the GOP in 17 states
including Oregon and Washington in which Bush's allies claim that
America has been in the grips of an ``education recession'' during
the Clinton-Gore years.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates barnstormed as nationwide surveys showed Bush
regaining ground that he lost to Gore following the Democrats'
convention in mid-August. A Gallup tracking poll of likely voters
showed Bush edging ahead of Gore 47 percent to 46 percent _ only
the second time that Bush had taken the lead over Gore since
leading the vice president 55 percent to 39 percent on Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Newport of the Gallup Poll said the closeness of the race
emphasizes the importance of the three presidential debates in
ultimately deciding what appears to be one of the closest
presidential elections in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush are scheduled to face off in Boston on Oct. 3, in
Winston-Salem, N.C., on Oct. 11 and in St. Louis on Oct. 17. The
two third party candidates in the race, Green party candidate Ralph
Nader and Reform party candidate Pat Buchanan, have not been
invited to take part because they have failed to draw 15 percent of
the vote in six nationwide tracking polls used by the private
bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates to determine
eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Gore continued to lead in the daily electoral count maintained
by the National Journal's Hotline political newsletter. Gore held
the edge in state-by-state polls in 26 states commanding 307
electoral votes; Bush led in 22 states with 180 electoral votes. A
candidate needs to win 270 electoral votes to win the presidency.

<P>
   During his appearance in Florida, Gore tried to portray Bush as
less committed to protecting Medicare by insisting that Bush's plan
to provide taxpayers an across-the board 10-year $1.3 trillion tax
cut from the projected $4.6 trillion federal budget surplus would
jeopardize the money needed to bolster Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would spend ``more on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1
percent of taxpayers than they're willing to invest in health care,
prescription drugs, education and national defense combined,'' Gore
warned.
</P>
<P>
   Gore promised that under his plan ``no big drug company or HMO
can veto'' a patient's choice of the most convenient pharmacy to
obtain prescription medication.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign countered Gore's proposal by claiming that
Gore's plan would give senior citizens only one chance to qualify
for prescription drug coverage, cost some senior citizens $600 in
annual premiums and take more than eight years to be fully
implemented.
</P>
<P>
   With his appearance in Oregon and Washington _ states that have
not voted Republican in a presidential contest since 1984 _ Bush
tried to build upon his gains among women voters since successful
appearances last week on daytime television talk shows hosted by
Oprah Winfrey and Regis Philbin.
</P>
<P>
   Bush who suffered a 17-percentage point deficit among women
voters in nationwide polls earlier in September has narrowed Gore's
advantage to 9 percentage points in the latest survey for Newsweek.

TAPE SCANDAL IN FRANCE CROSSES POLITICAL LINES 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A whiff of scandal crossed the political aisle here
Monday when a former Socialist Cabinet official acknowledged that
he was given a copy of a videotape accusing President Jacques
Chirac of illegal activities, but did not notify the authorities
during the two years he had the tape.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac quickly called on the Socialist prime minister, Lionel
Jospin, for a speedy investigation into whether Jospin's former
finance minister, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, got the potentially
damaging tape from a lawyer in exchange for giving a huge tax break
to one of the lawyer's clients.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin, who said he knew nothing about the tape until he read
transcripts from it in Le Monde on Thursday, promised a swift
inquiry, and said that Strauss-Kahn would hand over all relevant
documents to investigators by the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac has denied the accusations made on the videotape, but the
detailed account of a vast illicit fund-raising scheme has
nonetheless dominated the news here. On the tape, the former party
official, Jean-Claude Mery, describes in detail the vast network of
kickback schemes he oversaw that netted Chirac's party millions of
dollars a year in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Mery said he worked under instructions from Chirac, who was the
mayor of Paris at the time and the leader of his Rally for the
Republic party. The tape was made in 1996, when Mery, who has since
died of cancer, was being investigated for illegal fund-raising. He
says on the tape that he made it to protect himself.
</P>
<P>
   The role of Strauss-Kahn, a close friend of Jospin, did not come
to light until Sunday night when a respected weekly magazine,
L'Express, which was to have printed the article on Wednesday, put
it on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The L'Express story says that a lawyer who helped Mery make his
tape gave the cassette to Strauss-Kahn in the summer of 1998 in
exchange for a huge tax break for one of his other clients, Karl
Lagerfeld, the fashion designer.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss-Kahn, who was forced last year to resign his ministerial
post after allegations of false accounting at his law firm arose,
denied all wrongdoing in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deny all political connections that people are trying to
make as well as any connections with any tax dossier,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the lawyer who gave him the tape, Alain Belot, was
an associate of his who gave him the tape because he thought it was
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was worth looking at and made no use of
it,'' Strauss-Kahn said. ``I don't even know where I put it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lagerfeld's fashion company, Lagerfeld Gallery in Paris, said he
was traveling in Italy and could not be reached. Belot did not
return calls to his office.
</P>
<P>
   Though Chirac and Jospin are longtime archrivals likely to meet
again in the 2002 presidential elections, they seemed to be in the
same boat on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal enveloped them both as did the lingering sense of
failure and poor timing that accompanied the results of Sunday's
referendum on whether France's presidential term should be cut to
five years from seven.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum, which both supported, was approved easily. But
nearly 70 percent of the voters did not bother to even go to the
polls and another 5 percent (nearly 2 million people) registered
their disdain for the question by leaving their envelopes empty or
filling them with ripped up ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters complained that they would rather have been
consulted on more pressing matters, like tax cuts or the 35-hour
workweek that the government has been putting in place during the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were heavily criticized in newspaper editorials Monday
as totally out of touch with the population.
</P>
<P>
   Accusations of corruption and illegal fund-raising are not new
to any of France's major parties. But the Mery tape has provided
the kind of drama that seems to have brought even France's most
cynical citizens to attention.
</P>
<P>
   On the tapes, Mery, a developer and a member of the governing
committee of the Rally for the Republic party, described how he got
kickbacks from almost everyone who wanted to do business with the
city, particularly those who wanted to build housing for the poor.
On one occasion, Mery said that Chirac was present when he handed
one of his aides $700,000 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The tape would be questionable evidence in court because Mery
cannot be cross-examined. But magistrates investigating illicit
fund-raising were nevertheless interested enough on Friday to
search the offices of the journalist who helped Mery make his tape.
On Monday, several magistrates were supposed to go to a bank vault
to obtain an envelope Mery apparently gave one of his lawyers for
safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   While Jospin and Chirac are now at the center of the political
storm, they arrived there along different paths. Jospin, stiff and
earnest, has a squeaky-clean reputation that could be shattered by
the scandal. He has held his ministers to high standards, for
instance, insisting Strauss-Kahn leave government until he had
cleared his name, though no charges have been forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac, on the other hand, who exudes warmth on the campaign
trail, is no stranger to accusations of wrongdoing. He cannot be
criminally prosecuted as long as he is president. The courts made
that ruling last year, after evidence emerged linking him with the
practice of giving party workers government salaries, though they
never showed up to do the government job.
</P>
<P>
   But the accusations on the Mery tape are the most direct so far
and could clearly have an effect on his bid for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   When transcripts of the Mery tape were first published in Le
Monde, Chirac made the highly unusual decision to go on television
that night to rebut the accusations. He called the accusations as
an ``abracadabra story'' that amounted to no more than producing
``a man who had been dead more than a year laying out implausible
events that supposedly happened more than 14 years ago.''

 &HT;    Ranch houses finally being appreciated for architectural
significance
 &HT;    By J.B. Smith
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas -- It's architecture that evokes Mom's green-bean
casserole, Dad's patio barbecues, Skip and Sis on their Schwinn
bikes and the Zenith TV console in the den.
</P>
<P>
   Ranch houses, those rambling, low-slung houses of the '50s and
'60s, hang on in the 21st century as icons of suburbia, at its
cookie-cutter worst and its bucolic best. And now the moment of
truth is arriving: Do we care enough about these houses to preserve
them?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone builds ranch-style houses anymore, at least if
they have the money to build the more monumental style favored
today _ the grand porticos, the cathedral ceilings, the steep
rooflines that dwarf the stories below.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the ranch house, even the upscale version, is
modest and low-profile. Low-pitched roofs and eight-foot ceilings
predominate; the facade seems to sink into the background. The
one-story houses are horizontally oriented, right down to the
picture windows. The whole house seems to be lying down for a
snooze.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there's a growing appreciation for the ranch in preservation
circles, partly because of these unpretentious qualities. The
National Register has begun to add ranch houses to its listings,
including an entire subdivision in Denver and the Temple home of
Wilsonart founder Ralph Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that as we get further into the 21st century, people
are starting to look at postwar architecture and evaluate what is
good and bad,'' said Marcel Quimby, a Dallas architect and an
adviser to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. ``Enough
time has passed now to be objective about it, and I think the ranch
is beginning to be appreciated. It's one of the few indigenous
American forms of architecture. It doesn't occur anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   The style dates back to the house designs of California
entrepreneur Cliff May in the 1930s. His designs, popularized
through house magazines like Sunset, were loosely based on the
traditional sprawling adobe houses of the 19th-century West. The
open interior designs, attention to landscaping and a streamlined
look offered an appealing departure from the past, and May even won
the rare praise of architect Frank Lloyd Wright.
</P>
<P>
   But it was in the housing boom after World War II that the
houses really caught on, said Jim Steely, chief historian for the
Texas Historical Commission. Ranch houses were easy to
mass-produce, and lending institutions saw them as safe bets. They
required large lots, but that was no problem: Families now had cars
and could take advantage of cheap land on the edge of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a product of the postwar automobile culture,'' Steely
said.
</P>
<P>
   Waco has an abundance of ranch houses, thanks to its postwar
prosperity. Census figures show that 41 percent of the houses in
Waco were built between 1950 and 1969, the height of the ranch era.
</P>
<P>
   Waco's best ranch houses are tucked away in leafy neighborhoods
around Cameron Park, Park Lake Drive, Lake Waco and the hills along
Wooded Acres, neighborhoods blessed with lots of elbow room.
Meanwhile, the sawed-off, mass-produced versions dominate the tract
neighborhoods of the same era.
</P>
<P>
   Ranch neighborhoods have mellowed over the years with the help
of mature trees and landscaping. Ranch houses can still fetch
decent prices if they are well-kept and situated in good
neighborhoods with ample lots, said Darwynn Nail, an agent with
Kelly Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he doesn't see nostalgia-driven homebuyers seeking
to restore ranch houses to their mid-century style. Instead,
homeowners tend to prefer complete makeovers to update the houses.
</P>
<P>
   Architect B.J. Greaves, who designed the restoration of the Dr
Pepper building downtown, said ranch houses may eventually become
fashionable again, but he hasn't seen it happen yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a lot of buildings that sort of fall into a gray area:
They're not new but they're yet old enough to be appreciated for
their age,'' he said. ``We saw the same thing happen to
turn-of-the-century buildings in the 1950s. People went in and
remodeled them, and some of the original style and detailing was
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Quimby, the Dallas architect, sees examples elsewhere in Texas
where ranch house devotees have done faithful restorations, but she
said it's not a sweeping trend yet.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she said she's troubled by a trend she sees in
Dallas, where aging ranch homes are being bulldozed and replaced
with mini-mansions, or ``North Dallas specials,'' that gobble up
the once-spacious lots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some great '50s and '60s homes that are being torn
down because people want bigger homes,'' she said. ``You see whole
streets of new two-story houses where there used to be ranch
houses. It really changes the character of the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   She said ranch houses, with their plentiful green space and
ample windows, tend to be outwardly oriented and sociable, whereas
the new tract mansions are about interior luxury.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of redevelopment might seem unlikely in Waco, where
land prices are generally cheap. But there are parts of Waco where
aging ranch houses sit on prime real estate.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a row of low-roofed ranch houses from the '50s and
'60s line the ridge on Mountainview Drive overlooking Lake Waco. In
this area, which is perched above Lake Shore Drive, a typical house
lot is worth about $70,000, according to neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Lent Hardeman, a local structural engineer, bought one
of those ranch houses and tore it down. In its place he is building
his dream house: A French-style home with pink-gray brick, leaded
glass windows, stone ledges, ornate trim and a huge roof. The
house, which barely squeezes into the lot, has 3,500 square feet,
twice the size of its predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We originally thought we might be able to remodel the house
that was there, but we could really seem to modify the older house
for what we wanted, so we decided to build a new house,'' Hardeman
said. ``If we were going to take advantage of the view, it only
made sense to build an upscale home.''
</P>
<P>
   The new house has 10-foot ceilings in most rooms, soaring to
nearly 30 feet in the great room. The old house had the standard
eight-foot ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was certainly nothing wrong with that, but we wanted a
little more vertical wall to give a feeling of more space,''
Hardeman said.
</P>
<P>
   Hardeman said the tall roof was simply an aesthetic
consideration. After he began building, a neighbor complained that
it blocked his view of the lake, but by that point it was too late
to change course, Hardeman said.
</P>
<P>
   Hardeman said lots with views of Lake Waco have become scarce,
and he expects more existing lots will be redeveloped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think over time, more people will be doing this sort of
thing, buying old homes and building better houses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hardeman's future next-door neighbor, Bruce Neatherlin, said he
welcomes the new addition, and he admires its craftsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had more people ask me, 'When is that guy building next
to you going to finish?' `` Neatherlin said. ``I tell them, I'll
let you know when it's done.''
</P>
<P>
   But as for himself, Neatherlin is content with his 1958 ranch
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing is that it's paid for,'' he said. ``It's easy to
upkeep, too. I think the fellow who built this house was a very
energy-conscious person.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the original ventilation system was ahead of its time,
but he decided to replace the original windows with more efficient
double-hung glass.
</P>
<P>
   Steely, the Texas Historical Commission historian, said energy
efficiency isn't a strong suit of ranch houses: There's too much
glass, the house is too thin, the roofs are too shallow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're probably looking at the demise of ranch houses with the
energy crisis of the mid-70s,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some historians also say the rising cost of land ended the era
of the ranch house. With smaller lots to work with, builders
preferred to build up instead of out. According to the National
Association of Homebuilders, 73 percent of homes built in 1971 were
one-story; in 1998 it was just 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their inefficiency, Steely said the best
architect-designed ranch houses offer some virtues.
</P>
<P>
   ``At their best, they would have some response to the natural
site,'' he said. ``They would fit among the existing trees, respond
to the rolling hills. They would have quality materials like brick
and stone. A good example would have a well-designed interior that
responds to the occupants' needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Steely said he expects ranch houses will come back in style some
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember 25 years ago, when people looked at bungalows
the same way we're looking at ranch houses now,'' he said. ``People
said, those are just 1920s tract houses. Now there's whole
magazines on how to preserve bungalows.''
</P>
<P>
   Neatherlin said he expects that with the rising cost of housing,
the simplicity of the ranch house may become appealing again to
young homebuyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What goes around comes round,'' he said.

 &HT;    Laminates abound in house once owned by Wilsonart founder
 &HT;    By J. B. Smith
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPLE, Texas _ You could easily overlook the Wilson House, a
ranch house in a quiet
</P>
<P>
   neighborhood of ranch houses east of Interstate 35. It's a
pleasant but unassuming
</P>
<P>
   U-shaped house of natural stone and brick, shaded by big oaks
and deep overhanging
</P>
<P>
   eaves.
</P>
<P>
   But step inside, and it's another story altogether. Bursting
with shiny orange, turquoise, hot
</P>
<P>
   pink, black and yellow surfaces, furnished with sleek appliances
and furniture, the home's
</P>
<P>
   interior looks like a home decor ad from the Kennedy era. And
that's by design.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Wilson Sr., founder of Wilsonart International plastics
company, built the house in
</P>
<P>
   1959 as his private home and a showcase for his laminates, then
an exotic new material
</P>
<P>
   not widely used in homes. Walls, counters, cabinets, tables,
even shower stalls were clad in
</P>
<P>
   the laminates, and the house was photographed extensively for
brochures and
</P>
<P>
   advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, this shrine to plastic interiors has been
bought by the company,
</P>
<P>
   restored to its original splendor, turned into a house museum
and given some of the nation's
</P>
<P>
   most prestigious preservation honors. In 1998, it was named to
the National Register of
</P>
<P>
   Historic Places, and last year it received an award from the
National Trust for Historic
</P>
<P>
   Preservation.
</P>
<P>
   All of which remains a source of amazement for Wilson's widow,
Sunny .
</P>
<P>
   A woman of admittedly traditional tastes, she papered over the
laminate walls in the late
</P>
<P>
   '60s, with the permission of her husband, who died in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place had a lot of things I enjoyed and liked, but that
style was not my first love,'' she
</P>
<P>
   said. ``I was not a '50s fan, so I covered up what I could. I
had different flooring put in. I had
</P>
<P>
   a beautiful chandelier hanging from those eight-foot ceilings.''
</P>
<P>
   When she decided to sell the house in 1997, a Realtor told her
that the house would sell
</P>
<P>
   better with a remodeled kitchen. Wilsonart officials offered to
install new kitchen and
</P>
<P>
   bathroom surfaces in exchange for the original laminates, which
would be put in storage for
</P>
<P>
   posterity.
</P>
<P>
   Laminate, a hard surface made of paper and plastic, is best
known by the trade name of a
</P>
<P>
   competitor, Formica, although Wilsonart now the leads the
market.
</P>
<P>
   The replacement job was almost complete when Grace Jeffers, an
art historian from
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan who works with Wilsonart, persuaded the company to buy
the house and put the
</P>
<P>
   laminates back.
</P>
<P>
   ``She saw this house and went gaga over it,'' Wilson said. ``She
persuaded them to take out
</P>
<P>
   these beautiful new cabinets and put the old ones back.''
</P>
<P>
   With Jeffers' guidance, the house was painstakingly restored to
its original 1959 vision, right
</P>
<P>
   down to the magazines on the coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was quite pleased,'' Wilson said. ``I never thought of a
thing like that happening. I could
</P>
<P>
   hardly believe it when I heard it. But it's exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The house is now used for company functions and is open by
appointment for visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda White, a company public relations coordinator who leads
the tours, said visitors
</P>
<P>
   come from all over the world, and they are often spellbound by
the interior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has some familiarity with this kind of house,'' she
said. ``It reminds them of their
</P>
<P>
   parents or grandparents. It's very nostalgic. Everything
mid-century is coming back now.''
</P>
<P>
   Professional preservationists are no less enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great house,'' said Gregory Smith, National Register
coordinator for the Texas
</P>
<P>
   Historical Commission. ``Going into that house is like stepping
back into the '50s.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the it's extraordinary for a house that's less than
50 years old to be named to the
</P>
<P>
   National Register, which is a service of the National Parks
Service. And he noted that the
</P>
<P>
   house was considered to have national, not just local
significance.
</P>
<P>
   Smith called the house a fine specimen of the mid-century ranch
style. But he said its historical significance really derives from
its importance in the history of housing materials.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, officials with the National Trust for Historic
Preservation called the house ``a
</P>
<P>
   national monument to the vision of our recent past.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Wilson helped design the house, with interior design help
from his daughter, Bonnie
</P>
<P>
   McIninch, a Wilsonart designer.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, an Indiana native, started the company in 1956 after he
sold a plastics company in
</P>
<P>
   California called Laminart. He started a small manufacturing
operation in Temple to supply
</P>
<P>
   laminates to the nearby American Desk Co., but the company grew
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   White said Wilson was an egalitarian at heart and chose to build
an ordinary ranch house

BERMUDA FIRM WINS BIDDING WAR FOR CGU INSURANCE GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT BERNARD NELSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A little-known offshore insurance company outbid
Boston's Liberty Mutual and industry giant Travelers Group for the
rights to CGU Insurance Group, the companies said in a hastily
called press conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
   White Mountains Insurance Group, which is based in Bermuda but
runs its US operations out of Hanover, N.H., agreed to pay nearly
$2.6 billion for Boston-based CGU, itself the American arm of
London's CGNU Group.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds like so-much alphabet soup, others behind the
deal are household names.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman Brothers loaned White Mountains $1 billion to complete
the deal, and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway group agreed to
buy $300 million worth of convertible preferred stock as a minority
shareholder. Lehman Brothers also guided White Mountains through
the financing process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were up against the biggest, smartest financial companies
in the world,'' White Mountain chief executive Jack Byrne said at a
press conference in Boston. ``But lightning struck and we're the
ones standing here today.''
</P>
<P>
   The purchase price includes $2.1 billion in cash, plus $470
million in assumed debt. It includes all of CGNU's
property-casualty operations in the United States, but not its US
life insurance division. Quincy-based CGU Life Insurance Co. will
continue to report to the CGNU's London headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Gowdy, president and chief executive of the acquired
division, said the insurer's 1,370 Massachusetts employees won't be
impacted. CGU Insurance Group's headquarters are in Boston, and
operates a computer processing center in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a lot of restructuring two years ago, and we have the
painful part of improving our efficiency already behind us,'' Gowdy
said. ``I wouldn't expect anything else to change now, other than
those things that just come up normally in the course of
business.''
</P>
<P>
   CGNU publicly said it was putting CGU Insurance on the auction
block in February. The London insurer said it was consolidating its
operations and wanted to concentrate on the European market and, to
a lesser degree, life insurance and pension business in the US
market.
</P>
<P>
   White Mountains, Liberty Mutual, and Travelers quickly
established themselves as leading contenders. Byrne and Gowdy
wouldn't comment on the specifics of the bargaining Monday, but
both made thinly veiled allusions to the larger firms.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne said his competitors ``had their minds on other things''
in late-stage negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the larger property-casualty insurers in this country
have problems of their own to deal with,'' Gowdy said. ``Others,
perhaps, have other acquisitions in the works right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrne seemed to personally revel in the deal Monday. A one-time
executive vice president of the Travelers Group, he attempted to
buy Travelers after he left to run Geico Direct.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag proved too high, but Byrne worked with Warren
Buffett while at Geico, and he used that personal connection to
outduel Travelers for CGU.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called him at home Sunday night in Omaha, and asked if he
would kick in an extra $100 million to make it work,'' Byrne said.
``He thought about it for a minute, said he would, and here we are
a few hours later.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors apparently thought it was a good move for White
Mountains. On the New York Stock Exchange Monday, White Mountain
shares gained $37.63 _ more than 21 percent _ to close at $212.13.
Berkshire Hathaway's B shares gained $24, or 1.3 percent, to close
at $1,864.

 &HT;    Garza's winning style: keep it steady
 &HT;    By Arnold garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Jesus Garza is one of those rare individuals in
public life whose private moments don't vary much from his public
ones.
</P>
<P>
   What you see is pretty much what you get. Like every one else in
a position of leadership, Garza has attracted his share of critics,
but he isn't the sort of fellow to give in to them. Being a city
manager anywhere is tough work, but in Austin ... well, what can
you say?
</P>
<P>
   This is a city populated by self-proclaimed geniuses who are
convinced that they can do any job so much better than the
incumbent. The sad fact that they are being denied a chance to
prove that self-evident truth is just one more sign of the world's
injustice, or so they'll tell you.
</P>
<P>
   Ask those who know him to describe Jesus Garza and the word you
hear most often is ``steady.'' He's not flashy. He's not
flamboyant. He's steady.
</P>
<P>
   The manager works the same way on the City Council dais as he
does on the golf course. Garza shuns histrionics in favor of a
methodical, studied advancement of the ball regardless of how bad _
or good _ its position.
</P>
<P>
   He exerts authority gently, but firmly. He listens to staff but
settles disagreements with these words: ``Allow me to refer you to
the organizational chart.''
</P>
<P>
   Garza has been all over a variety of organizational charts and
at the top of the city's for the past seven years. In that time,
Austin has gone from down and out to hot ticket. As is the city's
character, there really hasn't been that much in between.
</P>
<P>
   Austin needed someone steady at the top. He's been the right
person in the right place at precisely the right time. It's a
conviction shared by a number of people and about to be confirmed
in the November issue of Governing magazine. Garza was selected by
the magazine's editors as one of nine top public officials in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Never much of a self-promoter, Garza delivered the news a couple
of weeks ago to me and a few other close friends in his trademark
matter-of-fact manner.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the honor a grand recognition for the manager, it is
also further confirmation that the city's national profile is
growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot to be proud of in Austin,'' said Mayor Kirk
Watson who, long before he became mayor, was a Garza fan, ``but
Austin should be proud of Jesus Garza.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to recap his top achievements, Garza cited the
transformation of downtown, the lease of Brackenridge Hospital, the
acquisition of open space in the county's environmentally sensitive
western quadrant and a guaranteed 50-year water supply. None of
those accomplishments came or is coming without its share of those
signature Austin challenges, although the conservation initiative
was the most popular.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown construction has resulted in traffic congestion, which
in turn has attracted criticism from those who, evidently, don't
break eggs when making omelets. Cost objections to securing a
guaranteed water supply masked an anti-growth agenda. (The more
water you have, the more people you can have.)
</P>
<P>
   That sort of criticism comes with the territory, and, although
Garza expressed frustration at times, the manager responded to
objections and questions methodically, dutifully making
modifications as the council mandated.
</P>
<P>
   He is the epitome of a good officer: He knows how to give orders
and how to take them.
</P>
<P>
   Take the bus directive, for example. You may not know this, but
several months ago, Garza suggested that his department heads leave
their cars at home periodically and find other ways to get to work.
Doing so, he said in a memo, would demonstrate an individual
commitment to clean air and reduced traffic congestion. So, if
you're riding the bus one day and see the city manager come aboard,
it isn't a publicity stunt. He's just trying to get to or from
work.
</P>
<P>
   Garza likes his job but understands that keeping it depends on
keeping a majority of seven very distinct personalities happy.
</P>
<P>
   As stressful as that existence can be, Garza handles it well.
The mayor is right. Austin should be proud of Jesus Garza and not
just because a national magazine selected him for recognition.
</P>
<P>
   He's loyal, he's dedicated and, most of all, he's steady.

   Brazilian diva Marisa Monte began her performance at UCLA's
Royce Hall on Friday night wearing a white feathered headdress and
a white wraparound as if she were ready for carnivale. But soon the
tall, lovely Monte had assumed a rock 'n' roll pose, stripping down
to an appliqued tanktop, black pants and an electric guitar on a
stage filled with pieces of stretched white fabric on which were
projected various color images.
</P>
<P>
   This is in keeping with Monte's eclectic mix of music that
ranges from the romantic pop-oriented sounds of her latest album --
``Memories, Chronicles and Declarations of Love'' -- to traditional
sambas to percussion-driven pieces.
</P>
<P>
   What is remarkable about Monte is that she handles them all with
ease.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking off the set with ``Amor I Love You'' from the new album,
Monte quickly had the packed house on her side as she used her
long, elegant arms to express the emotions of the song. (She sang
primarily in Portuguese, but it was evident that many of the songs
were about love.)
</P>
<P>
   While during much of the evening she performed with her powerful
nine-piece backup band, including four percussionists, she also
showed her quiet side with ``Gotas de Lunar,'' a lovely samba
written in 1918 by Nelson Cavaquinho and Guilherme de Brito,
accompanied only by guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Monte demonstrated an effortless vocal style, seeming to be able
to go from a whisper to a shout and then back into something airy
without taking a breath. Even the few times she obviously did, they
were done for rhythmic effect.
</P>
<P>
   If Monte seemed a bit out of focus, jumping in too many
directions musically, it didn't take anything away from her lively
and entertaining performance. Even if one didn't speak Portuguese,
her immense talent required no translation. &QL;

PROJECT TO IGNITE TINY THERMONUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS IS $1 BILLION OVER
BUDGET

 By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
  Two years ago at a scientific conference in Madison, Wis.,
physicist E. Michael Campbell gave a triumphant progress report on
a project to build a stadium-size laser at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The big laser, which would be the most powerful ever built, had
won congressional approval despite a construction cost of $1.2
billion and another $1 billion for research and development.
</P>
<P>
   The key to this remarkable success, the physicist said, could be
found in its threefold attraction to science and society. When the
project was completed in 2004, its 192 laser beams would converge
on a tiny fuel pellet, crushing and heating it until fusion
reactions among its atoms began spewing out nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
   Those experiments would allow bomb makers to study the physics
of nuclear weapons without exploding them, helping to assure the
reliability of the nation's nuclear stockpile. They would also let
engineers explore the possibility of commercial power plants based
on this type of ``laser fusion,'' and they would offer scientists
the chance to probe matter under conditions never before created in
a laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   After using those advantages to help score a victory for the
project, called the National Ignition Facility, or NIF, the
scientist directing the project told the conference, ``I see how
hard it is to get a billion dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Participants listened with a mixture of envy and admiration to
the man they knew as Campbell. Many were deeply dispirited by
recent revelations of sky-high costs, technical questions and an
overoptimistic sales message that would soon bring congressional
wrath, and its budget ax, down on another titanic fusion project,
this one based on powerful magnetic fields and called the
International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a series of plot twists, the fabulous laser could
face a similar fate. Events since that conference have damaged
Livermore's credibility, derailed scientists' careers and perhaps
threatened the nation's ability to safeguard its nuclear stockpile.
Campbell even turned out not to have the Princeton Ph.D. that his
peers assumed he had.
</P>
<P>
   But in an ominous echo of his words in Madison, NIF will cost at
least $1 billion more than originally expected. If the project
survives, it may have reached its nadir on Sept. 7, when project
officials were denounced on the floor of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   As negotiations between the House and Senate for the fiscal 2001
budget conclude, lawmakers must now decide whether to move about
$100 million to NIF from other activities that safeguard the
stockpile. The reallocation, which has been requested by the Energy
Department, would more than double the Clinton administration's
original request for the project and save it for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that its scientists simply underestimated the complexity
of building the laser, laboratory officials dismiss all accusations
that technical problems were intentionally covered up. Still, the
plunge in the project's political stock has been breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked as if they had all the answers, and they were moving
on the project,'' said Dr. Dale M. Meade, head of advanced fusion
concepts at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, who attended
the Madison meeting and who specializes in the sort of fusion that
the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor might have
produced. ``And since that time, the roof has fallen in on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Dr. George H. Miller, a former nuclear weapons
designer, who is now associate director for NIF programs at
Livermore, argues that the laser is the only vehicle for scientists
to study the high temperatures and densities of matter that occur
in an exploding nuclear weapon _ except, of course, in actual
nuclear tests, which the nation has not conducted since declaring a
moratorium on them in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``NIF is one of the major experimental facilities that we were
lacking when we ended nuclear testing,'' Miller said. The purpose
of the laser, he said, is to ``allow us to maintain our nuclear
deterrent, and to maintain it in a condition that is safe and
reliable _ but do it without nuclear testing.''
</P>
<P>
   The American program to achieve that goal, called science-based
stockpile stewardship, would eventually rely on data from the
laser, lower-energy experiments involving high explosives, and
information from nuclear explosions before the moratorium. Powerful
computers would weave together all of that data as a substitute for
actual tests.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said it was crucial that fuel pellets crushed by the
laser beams become hot and dense enough to achieve a condition
called ignition, in which fusion reactions are pouring out
relatively large amounts of energy, just as a bomb does. If the
pellets do not ignite, he said, ``it will call into question
whether or not the whole stockpile stewardship paradigm will
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Physicists have an imperfect understanding of the physics of
ignition, and Miller concedes that that issue was controversial
even when it was assumed that the laser could be built exactly as
planned. It still is not known, for example, whether the precisely
spherical implosion of the pellets needed for ignition can be
achieved, since even tiny irregularities can cause energy to squirt
out sideways and quench the process.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gerald A. Navratil, an applied physicist at Columbia
University, said that because numerous scientific review panels
gave the laser project a passing grade, its ballooning costs and
technical problems raised still more troubling questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as an insider, you have to say that it causes you to
question the way the system works today,'' Navratil said. ``I think
it would benefit science if we learn from this and make sure it
doesn't happen again.''  &QL;

 &HT;    What worked against Ann won't against Al
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ George W. Bush's races against Ann Richards in
1994 and against Al Gore this year havehad one common thread:
bashing Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, it worked. In 2000, it seems to have quit working.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over,'' said Chuck McDonald, press director of Richards'
1994 campaign, about the strategy of using Clinton to hammer Gore.
``It's done with. People just don't care any more.''
</P>
<P>
   With impeachment behind him, ``Clinton has had his 15 minutes or
whatever it is of shame, and he's been punished,'' McDonald said.
``With unprecedented economic prosperity, nobody in America is
upset.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just one difference between the smooth-flying campaign
cruise missile Bush rode in his 1994 and 1998 gubernatorial races
and the recent turbulence of his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Clinton's secret health care plan, his stance on gays
in the military and other problems had virtually every Republican
office-seeker running against him. Tex Lezar, GOP candidate for
Texas lieutenant governor, made pounding Clinton the focus of his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in late October of that year, said Richards ``stands
shoulder to shoulder with Mr. Clinton in trying to advance a
liberal agenda. I stand with the overwhelming majority of Texans
who believe Mr. Clinton's policies are wrong for America.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's final TV ad showed Richards hugging Clinton at the 1992
Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Bush won. And Republican insurgents, led by Newt Gingrich, won
control of the U.S. House of Representatives for the first time in
decades.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, Bush got a lot of mileage from linking Gore with
Clinton _ until August. But then Gore escaped from Clinton's shadow
at the Los Angeles Democratic Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's natural after eight years of a Democratic administration
to entertain the idea of changing horses,'' said Bruce Buchanan, a
University of Texas at Austin government professor who specializes
in the presidency. ``(The public) looked at George W. Bush as
someone with a famous last name, and that made him seem like a safe
and reasonable alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   But the conventions were the first opportunity for people to
focus on the substance of the choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore did OK, and that was enough to activate the structural
advantages, which are all Democratic,'' Buchanan said. The economy
is humming, and Gore's approach to issues resonates better.
</P>
<P>
   ``He offers things that are easier to see as helpful to ordinary
folks,'' Buchanan said. ``If you're an old person on Social
Security and Medicare, would you rather just have someone hand you
a (prescription drug) program that's automatic, or go study 15
different programs and bargain with an HMO?
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush was appealing _ until it came time for really kicking
tires,'' Buchanan said. ``Then, Bush starts shooting himself in the
foot _ the debates debate, the cleverly planted Gore insinuation on
the RATS ad.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Bush is on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, now a public relations consultant, says a presidential
campaign gets far more intense media scrutiny than a gubernatorial
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 Bush's paid TV ads, particularly in the anti-Clinton,
anti-Democratic climate, controlled the campaign, McDonald said.
``The Bush campaign was disciplined, and they stayed on message.
And we were not able to force them off that message, and neither
was the media.'' In 1998 Democrat Garry Mauro said Bush outspent
him by so much that Mauro never got close.
</P>
<P>
   Not so in the presidential race, McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush may try to stay on message, but the campaign is longer, the
other side has as much money, and the media scrutiny is far more
intense. Never before has Bush had ``every move, every statement''
inspected by the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   And if the campaign doesn't have something new to feed the
ravenous, gaffe-seeking national press every day, reporters it will
find something.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, the political wind favored the Republicans. After
six years of a Republican Congress, it's behind the Democrats,
McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The external factors over which Governor Bush has no control
are as favorable for Gore as they were unfavorable for Governor
Richards in `94,'' said McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro is less kind about the box Bush is in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he does a good job of explaining his position on issues,''
Mauro said, ``he loses.''

 UNDATED: happen again.''   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A commentary published in the Sept. 14 issue of the journal
Nature by Dr. Stephen Bodner, former head of laser fusion at the
U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, and Christopher Paine, a senior
researcher at the Natural Resources Defense Council, titled ``When
Peer Review Fails,'' came to similar conclusions on the project's
history. ``The advocates became captives of their own rhetoric, and
dissenting voices were ignored,'' those authors wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Ground was broken for the NIF in 1997. Late the next year, in
the first hint that something was seriously wrong, an internal
Livermore review led by Dr. Edward I. Moses, an engineer familiar
with large projects, determined that constructing the laser would
cost far more than physicists on the project had estimated, in part
because the physicists in charge had not considered the difficulty
involved in putting together the individual high-tech pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each person would be told that there was a potential _ because
that is the way it was phrased for a long time _ a potential
serious issue,'' said Tarter. ``The reaction was, `How can that
be?' And can't possibly be right.''
</P>
<P>
   Moses' work turned out to be solid. A few months after the
disastrous speech by Richardson, anonymous faxes to Livermore
revealed that Campbell did not actually have the doctorate that he
had allowed the laboratory to believe he had. Campbell eventually
resigned. At about the same time, Richardson, having learned of the
overruns, angrily announced a management shake-up at the project, a
large fine for the University of California, which manages the lab
under contract with the Energy Department, and other measures
intended to put the project back on track.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the General Accounting Office, the congressional
auditing agency, reported last month that the true costs of the
project would be at least $4 billion and that it would not be
finished before 2008. The agency also confirmed that the laboratory
and low-level Energy Department officials had failed to disclose
the problems once they knew of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They lied to us,'' Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said during budget
deliberations on Sept. 7. ``They simply lied to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson has moved to save the project from collapse by asking
that Congress shift about $100 million from other areas of
stockpile stewardship to NIF in the fiscal year 2001, more than
doubling the Clinton administration's original request. Of that
effort, Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., who heads the energy
subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said he
believed that the ``GAO report will haunt it.''
</P>
<P>
   The project's immediate fate rests with end-of-year budget
negotiations in Congress. For their part, project officials say
that the overruns amount to $1 billion, and that the other costs
found by GAO had already been in the laser's operating budget and
were not a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   These officials also point out that it was an internal review at
Livermore that turned up the problems in the first place after
numerous external reviews missed them, and they say that there had
never been intentional deception about the overruns _ simply a
particularly ill-timed period of disbelief and confusion leading up
to Richardson's speech.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, walking through the cavernous NIF building, which is
mostly complete although no laser components have yet been
installed, Moses said that the project's budget was now realistic
and that all remaining engineering problems could be overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that'll stop us is people not giving us the
money,'' said Moses, who is now the laser's project manager, as he
looked down from a walkway onto a complex of huge concrete braces,
reminiscent of an indoor Stonehenge, but painted in pastels and
designed to hold laser optics and long ``beam tubes'' through which
the light would travel.
</P>
<P>
   Moses compares the earlier management problems to those that
arise when technology visionaries in private industry form
companies but lack practical and organizational expertise. He said
that a large part of the cost increases came about because project
officials simply did not think about how the laser parts would
actually be put together.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, the beam tubes must remain free of dust
that could drift onto optics and heat up, burning the optical
surfaces when the powerful laser light flashed upon them. But while
the tubes are constructed in special factory clean rooms, they must
be joined together in the NIF building, which would ordinarily
contain dust. Project officials had not thought about those things.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you started thinking about those, which any project
manager does, you realize there was a hole in the organization _
there was a hole in the plan,'' Moses said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the project maintain that the final set of optics
that will focus the intense beams onto the target will be
susceptible to damage no matter how clean they are. But Moses said
that at worst, the problem could be dealt with by changing those
optics occasionally, and he hinted that the laboratory was close to
a technical solution involving a treatment, called annealing, of
the surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the project faces other doubts.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, physicists believed that a much smaller laser at
Livermore, called Nova, would ignite its pellets. Nova never came
close, but Miller says that scientists understand the process much
better now and that he thinks the odds are good for NIF The
project's other credibility problems, however, have caused this
otherwise obscure chapter of science history to be much discussed
recently.
</P>
<P>
   The immense price tag for NIF, even if it works perfectly and
ignites, has also severely eroded hopes that anything resembling
this kind of laser technology can ever be used economically to
create commercial power.
</P>
<P>
   Even basic scientists, who once could not wait to tether their
wagons to a machine they could never afford on their own, are
having second thoughts. That possibility once seemed ``pretty
exciting'' to some scientists, said Dr. Michael E. Mauel, a
physicist at Columbia University. Now, he said, the idea sounds
``not very cost effective.''

   UNDATED: Latin roots.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Born Dec. 18, 1980, in Staten Island, N.Y., but raised primarily
in Pittsburgh, Aguilera is the daughter of a military father and a
musician mother who played violin and piano. Her father, Fausto,
was born in Ecuador, her mother, Shelly, in America.
</P>
<P>
   When Christina was young, it was difficult for her to call any
place home. As an Army serviceman, her father moved around a lot,
forcing the family to plant, then pull up, roots at a hectic pace.
They lived in Japan for a bit, and even in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera's family eventually settled in Wexford, Pa., where
Christina, at age 8, began taking singing seriously.
</P>
<P>
   During this time, though, Christina's parents separated, with
Christina living primarily with her mother. Perez says the
separation was so difficult for Christina, she blocked out most of
her early childhood, her Spanish influence through her father
included.
</P>
<P>
   ``She grew up in a Spanish-speaking domain,'' Perez says. ``But
after the separation, she had a lot of regret and she blocked out
the whole Spanish thing. It didn't help she was also growing up in
Pittsburgh and that all her friends were American. There aren't too
many Latinos there.''
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera's first break came from Ed McMahon's ``Star Search.''
Later came singing the national anthem for local sports teams and a
chance TV show audition that led to a stint on Disney's ``The New
Mickey Mouse Club,'' on which pop singer Britney Spears also
appeared.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Mickey Mouse Club'' gig led to Aguilera contributing a
track to the ``Mulan'' soundtrack, then to her current record deal.
Practically overnight, Aguilera's popularity exploded, sending her
not only around the country but around the world; she has already
visited several Latin American countries, which Perez says was
another contributing factor in her interest in releasing a Spanish
disc.
</P>
<P>
   ``She started visiting all these Latin American countries and
listening to Latin American singers, like Shakira. She's a ``big''
Shakira fan,'' he says. ``She heard the passion and romantic
melodies and just fell in love with it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Loving the music and understanding it, though, are two very
different things. One of the biggest roadblocks that could keep
Aguilera from attaining huge success across the border is her
inability to speak fluently, much less comprehend, the language of
the music lovers she's trying to win over.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the hardest thing about this,'' Perez says. ``She
doesn't fully speak the language. But it's not her fault. She has
been surrounded by English. She studied in English. She lived in
English. But instead of criticizing her, I think it's important to
encourage her and other bicultural kids to learn both languages.
And she has learned a lot since we began working on the record. Now
she has a full-time tutor. She's looking forward to being able to
conduct a full interview in Spanish with the Spanish press and
performing Spanish concerts. Those are some of her goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are important, perhaps mandatory, goals, says 106.1/KHKS
(KISS) FM's Dave Morales.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Latin audience) is gonna look at her and say, `Is this
the real deal or is she doing this to sell more CDs?' '' says
Morales, who, like Aguilera, has a history rooted in Latin America.
``Can she back it up in Latin communities? Can she play Latin
concerts? They're gonna watch real closely. If you're faking it,
they'll recognize it and turn their backs.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Morales' sentiments seem to be echoing through the Latin
community: Is Aguilera driven by dollars or true desire?
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what motivates artists, from ego to credibility
to the almighty dollar,'' says the Dallas Hispanic Broadcasting
Corp.'s Valle. ``I think Christina's people wanna sell records,
sure,'' he says. ``But her heritage is a big deal with her. I think
it's more that she wants to have a chance to cross over into an
audience that she hasn't had much exposure to yet.''
</P>
<P>
   EMI's Ortiz says she's already off to a good start by being
honest, making it public knowledge that she cannot speak Spanish
fluently, but that she is making an effort to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because she has a Hispanic last name doesn't means she
knows the language,'' he says. ``But I think (the Latin audience)
will respect her for the sheer fact that she is taking the time to
learn their language and be a part of their culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step, Morales says, is proving that she's serious about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera's publicist, Mayna Nevarez, says that along with being
the spokesperson for Coca-Cola in Latin America, Aguilera will also
visit San Juan, Puerto Rico, this winter, where the Spanish version
of ``Come on Over Baby'' has been No. 1 on the pop charts for
weeks. A tour of other major Latin American cities is being mapped
out, Nevarez adds.
</P>
<P>
   Perez says what will truly make or break Aguilera's Latin
career, though, is her dedication to supporting the disc, as
opposed to just letting it rack up sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me the other day, `I love this album better than my
English album,''' he says. ``I said, `Well, it's probably just
because it's a new toy.' She said, `No, it's such a special thing
for me, to be able to sing in Spanish and have my grandmother and
father hear it.' ''

   Outward Bound for Women
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I find an Outward Bound group for women over 50 with
a focus on hiking or cycling? _ Maida Beren, Manorville, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. Outward Bound USA, with headquarters in Garrison, N.Y., runs
five ``schools'' across the nation and offers dozens of ``courses''
a year. It refers to its programs this way because the outings try
to teach nature skills and self-understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Steele, the national vice president for marketing, said
all the schools offered ``adult renewal'' courses. Only a few are
for women only, but coed courses tend to have more women than men,
he added, and usually attract people in their 30s, 40s and 50s.
</P>
<P>
   One note about accommodations: Outings use tents or, sometimes,
just a tarp above as protection from the elements. Don't expect hot
showers (or even cold ones).
</P>
<P>
   The only cycling course next year for women is for ages 16 and
up on Aug. 12 to 25. It mixes mountain biking and rock climbing in
North Carolina's Appalachians. The cost is $1,995 (prices include
food and specialized equipment, including tents).
</P>
<P>
   There are two women's backpacking trips in Maine: One in the
White Mountains and Mahoosuc range near New Hampshire, June 30 to
July 7, and Canoeing and Hiking in the North Woods, Sept. 1 to 8.
Each costs $995. The Desert Sampler course, in Joshua Tree National
Park in California, includes hiking and rock climbing. This has two
sessions: An eight-day trip March 11 to 18 ($995), and five days,
March 26 to 30 ($795).
</P>
<P>
   To find out more, call Outward Bound at (888) 882-6863 or go to
www.outwardbound.org.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd prefer a bike tour and more comfort, Bicycle Holidays,
1394 Munger Street, Middlebury, Vt. 05753, (800) 292-5388, plans
one or two trips for women in the Lower Champlain Valley of Vermont
next summer or early fall. Dates are not set, but this year's trip
was six days with five nights in inns and B &AMP; B's and included most
meals. Riders pedaled 30 to 40 miles a day. The cost was $1,195
each, double occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   For more choices, try Adventure Women, 15033 Kelly Canyon Road,
Bozeman, Mont. 59715, (800) 804-8686, fax (416) 587-9449,
www.adventurewomen.com, which specializes in trips for women over
30. It rates trips easy, moderate or high energy. An easy hiking
tour is its Olympic Peninsula Walkabout in Washington, next Sept.
15 to 21, covering about three miles a day on foot in Olympic
National Park and environs. Lodging is mainly in rustic lodges. The
cost is $1,825 a person, double occupancy, including most meals and
ground transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site www.infohub.com allows you to search for women's
tours of all kinds in various price categories, time periods and
locations.
</P>
<P>
   Dance Lessons in Dublin
</P>
<P>
   Q. I will be taking my 13-year-old daughter to Ireland and she
would like to take a beginner-level Irish dancing lesson in Dublin.
Is this possible? _ Ann Steiner, Lancaster, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   A. A lesson certainly should be doable _ considering that there
are more than 80 teachers in the city registered with the Irish
Dancing Commission, according to Sean Fegan, project officer at the
commission, which regulates competitions and certifies teachers
worldwide. He said he could not recommend any member over another,
so he urged that you ask your daughter's teacher for a
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   You can also contact Dennis Denahy, president of the Irish
Dancing Association of America, the commission's affiliate in
America, for a list of schools in Dublin, at 10608 Lockwood Avenue,
Oak Lawn, Ill. 60453, or (708) 636-8241.
</P>
<P>
   One of those on the list is the O'Shea School, 237 Dellwood
Grove, Castleknock, Dublin 15. Sean and Aine (pronounced Annie)
O'Shea hold beginners' classes _ as at many schools, 90 minutes to
two hours long _ on Wednesday and Thursday afternoons at different
sites. O'Shea said the cost would be about $5.50, at $1.08 to the
punt. Contact the O'Sheas at (353-1) 821-4327 or (353-87) 250-9147.
</P>
<P>
   Olive Hurley, who runs the Hurley School of Irish Dancing in
Kilcamud, said she offers beginner classes on Monday and Thursday
afternoons. Hurley, who has been teaching for 20 years, said the
cost would be about $5.50. See www.olivehurley.com, for more
information, or call her at (353-1) 269-8005.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Cosgrave, a director of the Dublin Folk Dance Group,
48 Ludford Drive, Ballinteer, Dublin 16, phone and fax (353-1)
298-7929, said her school offered lessons three evenings a week in
Dunbrum, about six miles from Dublin center. Classes average about
20 students of various ages, and cost about $4.
</P>
<P>
   Genealogy in Basel
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I find out about genealogical societies or
professionals in Basel, Switzerland? _ Dorothy Kinney, Lafayette,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A. On the Web, genealogy.net leads to a page for the Swiss
Genealogical Society, which owns a library. To seek information,
contact Alfred Dobler, Alte Bilindenholzstrasse 14, 8616 Riedkikon,
Switzerland; e-mail, alfred.dobler(at)gmx.net.
</P>
<P>
   The Genealogical and Heraldic Society of the Region of Basel
deals with both Basel-Stadt, the city, and Basel-Landschaft, the
canton. The society's prsident, Dr. Hans B. Kaelin, Steinbuehlallee
189, CH-4054 Basel; (41-61) 301-7455, fax (41-61) 301-7451, said he
could help with addresses of archives and of members who have
knowledge of particular areas.
</P>
<P>
   But you might want to begin in the United States with The Swiss
Connection, a quarterly put out by Maralyn Wellauer. She wrote the
1979 book ``Tracing Your Swiss Roots,'' now out of print, and is
revising it. Wellauer's newsletter ($12 a year) prints articles on
researching family histories and runs personal queries from
subscribers free.
</P>
<P>
   She said she would personally take queries on genealogy; contact
her at 2485 North 72nd St., Milwaukee, Wis. 53210; (414) 778-1224,
fax (414) 778-2109. In addition, her Web site,
feefhs.org/ch/tsc/frg-tsc.html, includes a link to addresses of
cantonal archives in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Wellauer recommended using the Genealogical Library of the
Church of the Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City, saying it
contained all Basel parish registers. Call the livrary at (801)
240-2584, or start searching at www.familysearch.org.
</P>
<P>
   Another large and comprehensive Web site is www.genealogy.com,
with articles, search engines, chat rooms and links to other sites.
</P>
<P>
   For general travel information, contact Switzerland Tourism, 608
Fifth Ave., New York, N.Y. 10020, (212) 757-5944, fax (212)
262-6116.

'PET SOUNDS' ROCKS THE BOWL
</HEADLINE>
bc-LADN- (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c. 2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Get ready for the keyboard sound of the year!''
</P>
<P>
   Former Beach Boys musical leader Brian Wilson didn't have to say
the year he was talking about Sunday at the wonderful ``Pet
Sounds'' symphonic concert at the Hollywood Bowl was 1966.
</P>
<P>
   So, there were more than a few smiles in the audience when two
keyboardists in Wilson's superb backing band, which included
several members of local pop band the Wondermints, began playing
tinkling unison parts that seemed so quaint it's no wonder they've
probably never even been sampled.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who after decades of psychological problems, was back,
sitting center-stage in front of a keyboard that was apparently not
plugged in, singing such celestial ``pocket symphonies'' from his
brilliant ``Pet Sounds'' album as ``Wouldn't It Be Nice,''
``Caroline, No'' and ``God Only Knows.''
</P>
<P>
   In between songs, he offered one-liners and non sequiturs such
as ``We're almost there,'' ``Here's Pet No. 2'' and ``We're gonna
be rockin' and rollin' soon.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a marvelously paced event, opening with a gorgeous
20-minute suite of Wilson's major musical themes outside of ``Pet
Sounds,'' conducted by longtime Wilson collaborator Van Dyke Parks.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after a 40-minute set featuring Wilson and his excellent
band performing such songs as ``In My Room'' and ``Surfer Girl,''
the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, conducted by the good-natured
Woodland Hills-based Christopher Floyd, took its place, and Wilson
called off the first of the 14 tunes from ``Pet Sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bowl's 10,000-plus audience, consisting of Wilson obsessives
and Beach Boys fanatics, were plainly awed by the beauty of
saxophonist-flutist Paul Merten's arrangements based on Wilson's
own hand-crafted recordings. One of the best-received numbers from
the album was the odd, Esquivel-like instrumental title track,
which Wilson said he originally composed for a James Bond movie but
which was eventually turned down.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, we put it on 'Pet Sounds,' '' Wilson, 58, explained.
</P>
<P>
   The last of the Hawthorne-based brothers that founded the Beach
Boys in 1961, Wilson never seemed like an oldies act on stage,
thanks to the youthful exuberance and note-for-note perfection of
his sprawling backing band's lovingly placed instrumental and vocal
passages.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably true that the average age of the musicians on
stage, aside from Wilson, nearly matches the ages of the Beach Boys
when ``Pet Sounds'' was recorded in 1965-66.
</P>
<P>
   That may be one explanation why those spiritual-sounding
high-register harmonies on ``You Still Believe in Me,'' ``Good
Vibrations'' and ``I Know There's an Answer'' seemed so fresh
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome back, Brian. Don't stay away too long.

 &HT;    Gore's call to use oil reserves a bad idea and he knows it
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's something about oil that makes people irrational.
</P>
<P>
   People from around the world have become dependent on oil and
its many by-products. When oil supplies cannot reach consumers,
they experience severe withdrawal symptoms. That's when politicians
step in.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Vice President Al Gore was trolling for votes,
especially in the Northeast, when he called on President Clinton to
authorize pumping oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum
Reserves to moderate the price of gasoline and home heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   America's Strategic Petroleum Reserves were meant to be used for
strategic purposes, as the name implies, during times of war or
when the nation's oil shortages threaten national security.
</P>
<P>
   More that 570 million barrels of oil were not pumped into salt
dome caverns in Texas and Louisiana just to lower gasoline and
heating oil prices seven weeks before a national election.
</P>
<P>
   Every time the price of oil fluctuates upward causing increases
in the cost of gasoline, diesel and heating oil, politicians start
coming up with zany ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats are both guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, Congress orders an investigation into the
``price-gouging'' by oil companies that are making ``obscene''
profits.
</P>
<P>
   All of these companies are publicly held and their stock is
available for purchase. The fact is that oil companies do not set
the price of oil and their profits over their expenses do not come
close to profit margins in other industries.
</P>
<P>
   None of those investigations, including one called earlier this
year when gas prices shot up in the upper Midwest, has found
anything other than normal supply and demand forces behind
fluctuating oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year when someone else called on the president to
release oil from the nation's strategic reserves, Gore ridiculed
the request by saying that all Saudi Arabia would have to do is
crank its valves shut just enough to match whatever we took out of
our reserves. We would end up with depleted strategic reserves with
no benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was right. And that same thing could happen now that
Clinton is going along with Gore's request.
</P>
<P>
   The only way Americans can have more control over the price they
pay for petroleum products is to reduce the nation's huge appetite
for oil, increase domestic oil production, develop alternative fuel
sources or agree on some combination of the above. Reducing gas
taxes would help little since the federal tax revenues are
dedicated to build and maintain the nation's highway
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The nation needs a national energy policy that conserves energy,
encourages research and development of alternative energy sources
and boosts environmentally safe production of domestic energy
sources.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Strategic Petroleum Reserves should not be
used for short-term price reductions just before an election.

SOMETHING FOR THREE GENERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Iowa, Calif.)   (For release Sunday, Oct. 1)  
 By CHRISTOPHER HALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For several years before their 50th wedding anniversary, my
partner's parents, Frank and Lucy, knew exactly how they wanted to
celebrate the occasion. ``In March of 2000,'' they would tell their
children, their children's spouses and partners, and their
grandchildren, ``we're taking all of you on a Caribbean cruise.''
</P>
<P>
   No one doubted their sincerity or generosity, but still it was
with a pleasant sense of unreality that we finally convened in San
Juan, Puerto Rico, in March to board the brand new Ocean Princess.
Nineteen strong and ranging in age from almost 7 to 70, we had come
from Iowa and California for a floating family reunion, a
seven-night cruise with stops at Trinidad, Barbados, Antigua,
Martinique and St. Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   For everyone but Frank and Lucy, it was a first cruise, and it
was only the fifth voyage for the 2,012-passenger, 77,000-ton Ocean
Princess. Operated by Princess Cruises, a subsidiary of the
Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co. of London, the ship
had come into service a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It's a handsome vessel, inside and out. The long, sloping prow
creates a streamlined profile for a ship that is 14 stories tall
and 856 feet long. Inside, subdued lighting, potted palms and lots
of wood paneling give most of the public areas the understated look
of a classic ocean liner.
</P>
<P>
   One exception is the glitzy, four-story atrium adjacent to the
two main dining rooms. With its boutiques, marble and shiny brass,
the atrium seemed like an upscale shopping mall (except when tables
piled with bargain merchandise periodically appeared outside the
shops, making it seem more like Filene's Basement). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Ocean Princess has the casino, fitness center, live shows,
four pools and choice of restaurants you'd expect on a ship this
big and new, but my favorite feature turned out to be far more
elemental: the fresh, balmy sea air my partner, Mac, and I breathed
day and night thanks to the sliding glass door and private balcony
of our outside cabin. Of the ship's 975 staterooms, 410 have
balconies, and at roughly 4 by 10 feet, ours was large enough to
fit two chairs and a small table, where most mornings we had a
light room-service breakfast while watching the gymnastics of
flying fish.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 19 of us were spread among six identical aft cabins; Mac and
I had one to ourselves, as did Frank and Lucy, and the rest of our
group occupied the remaining four. The cabins were on the Aloha
deck, the 11th highest of 14 decks and one that gave us lofty views
of sea and port. Conveniently situated just above us was the
Riviera deck, with its three outdoor pools, gymnasium and spa.
</P>
<P>
   While most staterooms have a queen-size bed or two twins that
can be made into a queen, our group had four-berth cabins. Three of
the berths fold out of the walls and a twin serves as a sofa during
the day _ a fairly tight fit when all four are occupied, although
the wall of glass and the balcony beyond make it feel less cramped.
</P>
<P>
   Closets were ample for two people _ four was stretching it _ and
cabins were equipped with a safe, desk-dresser, small refrigerator,
telephone and television. Each bed had its own reading light. The
plush terry cloth robes were a nice touch, and the tiny bathrooms
had a stall shower, wash basin and seemingly endless supply of hot
water. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As handsome and amenity-filled as the ship was, the service was
its most impressive feature. The staff, which hailed from Central
Europe, the Philippines, Italy, Britain and other countries,
usually struck a note that was friendly, not chummy; helpful, not
obsequious . I was especially impressed by the special attention
given to Frank and Lucy's anniversary. One of their sons had
written to Princess and to a friend of his who knew someone at the
cruise line to ask if something special could be done to recognize
his parents' milestone. The result was a congratulatory note,
flowers and bottle of champagne from the captain, a fancy cake
presented with much fanfare at the end of our second formal dinner
and an invitation for all of us to visit the bridge during the
sail-away from Martinique that night.
</P>
<P>
   During the bridge visit, we chatted with the captain and his
officers and watched in awe as they maneuvered their massive, $300
million vessel out of an impossibly narrow space. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Each night in the dining room, we had three adjacent tables and
our own waiter, a wry, bespectacled Hungarian named Levent, who
told us he'd postponed starting a veterinary practice to see the
world for a few years. The food was uniformly good _ favorites like
tender Nebraska prime rib; wonderful pastas sauced by our Italian
head waiter; seafood dishes like tilapia in a citrus-caper sauce;
and always a nice selection of vegetarian and ``healthy choice''
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   It was great fun to watch the younger members of the family _
whose dining-out experience was mostly of the fast-food type _ rise
to the challenge of ordering from a multicourse menu. Gently
coached and encouraged by Levent, the kids became savvy restaurant
patrons. They tried escargots or asparagus tips in puff pastry,
ordered a starter or two in lieu of a full meal when they weren't
very hungry, or requested an extra dessert when they just couldn't
decide which of two to choose. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Princess bills itself as ``the Love Boat,'' and in the weeks
before our cruise, I kept spotting news reports of romance-related
publicity stunts preceding the launch of the Ocean Princess. From
the moment we stepped on board, however, it was clear that the ship
would be as much ``the family boat'' as ``the love boat.'' I saw
plenty of hand-holding couples of all ages, but also parents with
children, and a number of groups like ours that included three
generations.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, although there were 2,004 people aboard _ 99.7
percent of capacity _ the ship did not seem crowded, and everyone
seemed to get along fine. I have a fond memory of Kate, age ``6}''
chatting with newfound friends in their 30s and 40s as they all sat
one evening in an outdoor whirlpool. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Ocean Princess has indoor activity centers geared for
smaller children and teens, although none of the younger people in
our group seemed interested because there were more than enough
cousins with whom to swim, explore the ship and _ in the case of
the teen-age boys _ make raids on the round-the-clock buffet (from
7:30 p.m. to 4 a.m., it's bistro-style table service). Even we
adults seemed more inclined to read, visit and relax by the pool
than, say, play a round of virtual golf or attend an aerobics
class.
</P>
<P>
   I had every intention of using the well-equipped gym, but a
sinus infection _ quickly dealt with by the ship's doctor _ and
tropical lassitude got the better of me. I did, however, make
several forays to the library, have my hair cut in the salon ($25)
and take slow walks on the Promenade Deck, whose broad, teak path
outfitted with canopied steamer deck chairs seemed a world away
from the sun-tanning crowds around the main pool. I also indulged
in a terrific massage at the spa ($90 for 50 minutes); the masseur,
however, should rethink his posttreatment practice of bluntly
suggesting a 15 percent tip.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We picked up the pace during day trips at our ports of call,
each of which Mac and I had researched using guidebooks and the
Internet before leaving. Our homework, supplemented by guidebooks
in the ship's library, freed us from total reliance on organized
shore excursions or the shopping-heavy port information provided by
Princess, and allowed us to briefly sample island life while
escaping the cruise-ship hordes.
</P>
<P>
   For each island, our goals were simple: see one cultural or
historical site, have lunch at a nontouristy place and visit one
beach for an afternoon swim before heading back to the ship. By
using taxis we shared with others in our family group or by just
walking, we were able to achieve at least two of our goals on every
island, and at a cost that was no greater (and sometimes less) than
ship-organized excursions.
</P>
<P>
   In Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, for example, our long, fascinating
walk around this richly varied city of Afro-Caribbean and East
Indian culture and a visit to the botanical gardens were followed
by a vegetarian lunch at a popular neighborhood food stall. On
Barbados, our custom taxi tour included Harrison's Caves (an
extensive network of caverns with streams, waterfalls, stalactites
and stalagmites) and the Flower Forest (50 acres of flowers and
fruit trees) .
</P>
<P>
   We then had a wonderful buffet of island dishes in an old wood
house that is now Brown Sugar, a restaurant frequented by
government office workers. The Barbados excursion ended with a swim
at a powdery sand beach that we had almost to ourselves. &QL;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   On Martinique, one of the highlights of the trip, eight of us
hired a van for a trip through the inland rain forest and flower
farms to St.-Pierre, destroyed in 1902 by Mount Pelee's eruption.
There, we enjoyed French-Creole dishes like spicy kid stew and a
salad of avocado and salt cod on the flower-fringed terrace of Le
Fromager, a restaurant overlooking the Carribbean. On our return
along the coast, we made an impromptu stop in a tiny seaside
village to watch fishermen clean a shark they'd just caught. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mac and I did sign on for one ship-organized trip, a
$49-a-person catamaran excursion with about 60 other Ocean Princess
passengers to Antigua's barrier reef for an hour of snorkeling,
followed by a swim at an unremarkable beach. I had a good time even
though a recent eruption of the Soufriere Hills volcano on nearby
Montserrat had clouded the sea with ash and reduced underwater
visibility.
</P>
<P>
   On the ride back to port, when the crew broke out the rum punch,
fired up the recorded reggae and got a few people dancing, Mac was
drafted by a fellow passenger to lead the wobbling conga line _ a
goofy, happy and sunburned group _ around the deck.
</P>
<P>
   Before dinner on our last evening on board, I sat on our balcony
as the Ocean Princess slowly pivoted from the dock at Charlotte
Amalie, in a large, graceful arc, and headed out to sea. From one
deck above, where a poolside sail-away party was going on, I could
faintly hear the Sarah Brightman-Andrea Boccelli recording of
``Time to Say Goodbye,'' that lilting Italian-English ballad.
</P>
<P>
   I smiled, thinking how shameless it was of Princess to play the
song _ like a swelling movie soundtrack _ as we steamed away from
our final port of call. But I will concede that the smallest of
lumps had somehow found its way to my throat.  &QL;

bc-LADN- Two-time Oscar winner makes the leap to directing 
(For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c. 2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine Sally Field walking into her living room, greeting the
man she's about to go out with by saying, ``Does this look OK? Is
it too much? Too little? Maybe more jewelry. No, just earrings.
Really nice earrings.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiles but says nothing. She looks for a moment at her image
in a nearby mirror and says, ``Never mind. This is fine. What was I
worried about?'' A pause. ``It is OK, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   That's sort of how the two-time Oscar-winning actress seems to
feel about her feature directing debut, ``Beautiful,'' opening
Friday. There's a charming, down-to-earth professional insecurity
about her that mirrors that celebrated ``you like me'' speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful'' stars Minnie Driver as a young woman obsessed with
achieving greatness (or acceptance) in highly superficial beauty
pageants. It's a subject well-suited to big-screen treatment
because Hollywood, at its highly superficial best and worst, is the
biggest beauty pageant of them all.
</P>
<P>
   Mona Hibbard struggles to develop a sense of self-worth in a
home with a neglectful mother (Linda Hart) and a chronically angry,
lazy stepfather (Brent Briscoe). As a young teen-ager, she delivers
groceries to neighbors and siphons her profits to entry fees in
low-budget local beauty contests. Even when she picks up nothing
more than a ``participant'' medal when all the other girls score
trophies, she keeps her eye on the prize, the crown of the
internationally renowned Miss American Miss pageant.
</P>
<P>
   Mona befriends Ruby, a rather nerdy classmate with a kind heart
and a flair for sewing, and together they set out to transform Mona
into a beauty queen supreme.
</P>
<P>
   By their high school years, Mona (Driver) and Ruby (Joey Lauren
Adams) push toward Mona's goal, although Ruby's only reward is
seeing her friend happy.
</P>
<P>
   Mona succeeds in smaller competitions and is on track for the
Miss Illinois pageant when she discovers she's pregnant, the result
of one of a handful of meaningless flings. Ruby, who surely would
win Miss Congeniality if only she'd enter, makes the major
sacrifice of raising Mona's daughter (Hallie Kate Eisenberg) as her
own because motherhood would disqualify Mona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful,'' all about acceptance and validation from without
and within, is a good project for Field who, at 53, still is trying
to live down -- and explain -- her gushy 1984 best actress Oscar
acceptance speech for ``Places in the Heart'':
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had an orthodox career and I've wanted more than
anything to have your respect,'' she said then, referring to her
title characters in the lightweight TV comedies ``Gidget'' and
``The Flying Nun'' before her 180-degree turn with the film ``Stay
Hungry'' and ``Norma Rae,'' which garnered her first Oscar in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I didn't feel it, but this time I feel it and I
can't deny the fact you like me. Right now, you like me!''
</P>
<P>
   Field, who did a send-up last year of that moment for a Charles
Schwab &AMP; Co. commercial, found herself explaining with exasperation
-- once again -- what she meant with that speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``What that means is that the work worked,'' Field said. ``I
cannot deny to myself and I must feel it, that at this moment in
time, it worked. People have interpreted for years that it means I
don't think I'm likable.''
</P>
<P>
   Did her work work on ``Beautiful,'' her feature directing debut
after warming up on two made-for-TV movies? Asked how she will
gauge whether ``Beautiful'' is successful -- box office, reviews,
awards -- she dug in her heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing. I won't listen, I won't hear, nothing,'' she said
with a tinge of a pout in her voice. ``It's a success to me because
I directed it to the best of my capabilities and that's all there
is. And it's there and they're lovely little performances and it's
a nice little movie, and there's nothing else. There's nothing
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Invited to list her thank-yous for a hypothetical best director
Oscar, Field said, ``I wouldn't even go down that road, even in
like Pretendland, because I think it's biting yourself on the butt
or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, fair enough. But who did she turn to for support during the
process?
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I have anybody to call? No, and I think I do that
purposely. I think I don't want any advice,'' she said. ``I think
once you get into it you really have to fly by the seat of your
pants and really trust your own gut.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of people who were tremendously supportive of
me in day-to-day whatever, but was I calling Steven Spielberg in
the night and saying, 'Look, how would you set this up?' Because I
don't want him to see this movie, not now, not ever,'' she said,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have wanted to hear how he would have done it
because then I would say 'OK' and I would have done it that way.
And then I would not have learned how I would have done it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I say I hope Steven doesn't see it only because I have
such amazing admiration for him. It's almost like I don't want to
know. Even if he says, 'I love this movie,' I would be saying, 'No,
you don't! I know you don't!' And I don't want to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this was her third time behind the camera and she had
great confidence in the cast and the script, she said she was
nervous at the beginning of the shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly I think you're barking up the wrong tree -- whatever
saying you want -- if you don't come in nervous,'' Field said. ``If
you come in and you're just cool as a cucumber and had a fine
night's sleep and like you're going to have a picnic then I think
you'd better leave. You're in the wrong place.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd better be nervous, you'd better be anxious and have lost
5 pounds -- or gained 5 pounds, as the case may be -- because if it
doesn't mean that much to you, then it's just going to be too hard
for you to really continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Field (who says her secret to looking so young is to ``stay
scared'') thrives on that inherent anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live with those nerves,'' she said. ``They become your
friend. You feel most alive when you feel like you're falling off
the cliff.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams said she was willing to take the role even before reading
the script just because Sally Field was directing and had requested
her for the part of Ruby. She had never worked with Field before,
nor had she seen her TV directing work. She was just a major fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say don't meet your heroes, but there's nothing more
wrong in this case,'' Adams said. ``There was not one part of me
that was let down having worked with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she had a hard job in that it's weird to walk into a
situation where you already have respect and you haven't really
earned it for what you're there for, do you know? There was a huge
amount of admiration and respect and awe among everyone there, but
then she sort of had to prove herself, and I think she did.''
</P>
<P>
   Field has worked pretty steadily in TV and films for 35 years
and has two Oscars in her Brentwood den and a good start on a new
career that, as she says, allows her to tell stories of people who
are not necessarily her size, age and gender.
</P>
<P>
   But like so many successful people in Hollywood, she's still
reaching for that ultimate success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm waiting to make it. I don't know what you're supposed to
feel like when you've made it. I think that's when the Pearly Gates
become visible,'' she said with a laugh. ``That's when you make
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Sally Field has made it, whether she gets to make
another Academy Awards speech someday that will make us forget the
other one, we like her. We've always liked her. &QL;

TACO-SHELL RECALL RENEWS DEBATE OVER LABELING OF BIOENGINEERED
FOODS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Va., Iowa, Ohio, Texas, Ill.)  By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The discovery of an unapproved variety of genetically engineered
corn in a brand of store-bought taco shells is prompting new calls
for the labeling of bioengineered foods.
</P>
<P>
   But the case, which led Kraft Foods to announce a nationwide
recall on Friday, also offers a foretaste of some of the practical
difficulties involved in such labeling. Among the questions are the
reliability of testing, the degree to which conventional grains and
foods can feasibly be kept separate from those that are genetically
modified, and even the definition of genetically modified food.
</P>
<P>
   Such issues are already confronting the European Union,
Australia, Japan and other countries that already require labeling
or are moving toward it, with different countries, or even
different supermarkets in the same country, adopting different
standards.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, where about two-thirds of processed food
contains ingredients made from genetically modified corn, soybeans,
potatoes or other crops, Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich, D-Ohio, is
sponsoring bills requiring labeling and safety testing of such
foods.
</P>
<P>
   He seized upon the discovery, initially made by a coalition
opposed to bioengineered foods, that taco shells sold under the
Taco Bell brand contained small amounts of a genetically modified
corn known as StarLink. The corn, with a gene to make it more
pest-resistant, has been approved for use as animal feed but not
for human consumption because it contains a protein with some
characteristics of an allergen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It concerns me, and should concern American consumers, that
this is a glimpse of things to come as genetically engineered
products are rushed to store shelves without real mandatory safety
testing and labeling programs in place,'' Kucinich said in a
statement last week.
</P>
<P>
   He later elaborated in an interview that if labeling were
required the problem might have been caught, because labeling
``would establish a higher level of responsibility among those in
the biotechnology industry in controlling what is in their
products.''
</P>
<P>
   But those in the food industry say this was not a case of a
biotech product being rushed to market without safety testing.
Indeed, it was because of such tests that the corn in question had
not been approved for human consumption. Nor, they say, would
labeling have made a difference in this case, since the taco shells
were not supposed to have the StarLink corn in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft said the corn came from a Texas mill operated by Azteca
Milling, which said Monday that it was investigating what might
have happened.
</P>
<P>
   What the incident does show, in any case, is how difficult it is
to keep one crop from contaminating another. The problem has also
arisen this year in Europe, where genetically modified material was
discovered in supposedly conventional crops. Keeping crops
segregated will require duplicate grain elevators, trucks and
barges, raising food prices, some analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is the trickiness of testing whether food and
crops have been genetically engineered. Both Kraft, a subsidiary of
Philip Morris, and the Food and Drug Administration scrambled last
week to figure out how to test for the presence of StarLink corn in
the taco shells. A cottage industry has sprung up to offer such
tests, and the Department of Agriculture is setting up a laboratory
to develop standardized tests and certify testing laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grain markets want to have assurances that the tests they
are utilizing and the laboratories they are utilizing are
credible,'' said Steven N. Tanner, the official in charge of the
project. Although Washington believes that genetically modified
foods are the same as other foods and need no labeling, American
crops will have to be tested for export to countries with labeling
laws, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that the modified foods approved for human
consumption are harmful. But critics say safety testing has not
been adequate so such foods should be labeled to give consumers the
choice of avoiding them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If juice is from concentrate it has to be labeled,'' said Jean
Halloran, director of the Consumer Policy Institute of the
Consumers Union. ``The difference between juice that is from
concentrate and not from concentrate is much less than between
genetically engineered and nonengineered foods.''
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology and food industry executives say the critics want
labeling because it will scare people away. ``It is not designed to
inform people, it is designed to alarm people,'' said Gene
Grabowski, a spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers of America,
which represents food companies. ``In Britain, where they have
mandatory labeling, you cannot find biotech foods.''
</P>
<P>
   How costly labeling would be is a matter of some debate and
study. And to some extent it depends on the practical issues,
starting with what exactly should be labeled.
</P>
<P>
   Cheese, for instance, used to be made using an enzyme from
calves' stomachs that coagulates proteins in milk. But it was
sometimes hard to procure enough calf stomachs, so the enzyme is
now made by bacteria or yeast with the calf enzyme gene. Neither
the bacteria or yeast nor the enzyme get into the cheese. So is
such cheese genetically modified?
</P>
<P>
   What about pork chops from a pig that ate genetically modified
corn?
</P>
<P>
   The European Union requires labeling mainly for ingredients made
from modified corn and soy. But Kucinich's bill would require
labeling the pork chops and the cheese and any other product even
touched by genetic engineering. That could apply to most foods in
the supermarket. Enzymes made in genetically engineered microbes
are used as processing aids in making not only cheese but some
breads, yogurt and beer.
</P>
<P>
   Another question is how much contamination to allow. Europe does
not require labeling of ingredients that are less than 1 percent
genetically modified. Kucinich's bill, which has more than 50
co-sponsors but is not expected to be acted on this year, would not
set any threshold, so even a speck of genetically modified material
would qualify for labeling.
</P>
<P>
   But the American agricultural system moves grain so fast that it
tolerates 2 percent to 7 percent foreign matter in bulk shipments
of corn. So trying to provide grain with less than 1 percent
genetically modified content could be unrealistic, the Institute of
Food Technologists, a scientific society, said in a report last
week.
</P>
<P>
   How low the threshold can be set also depends to some extent on
the sensitivity of the tests. Those using the tests now say that
while they usually work, there can be occasional inconsistencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had samples rejected on the barge with 30 percent GMO
and then re-tested at zero percent,'' said John Benz of the Ursa
Farmer's Co-op in Ursa, Ill., referring to genetically modified
organisms. Experts say results can vary based on the seeds chosen
for sampling.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Testing processed food is harder than crops. Heating and other
steps in food processing can destroy both the protein created by
the implanted gene and the implanted DNA itself. Some highly
refined foods like corn oil and refined sugar contain virtually no
DNA or protein at all. Europe does not require such oils to
labeled, even if they are made from genetically modified corn or
soy.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic ID of Fairfield, Iowa, the company that did the initial
tests of the taco shells for the coalition of biotech critics,
found about 1 percent of the StarLink corn, an amount on the
borderline of what would require labeling in Europe. The test was
for the DNA, so it did not establish that the protein itself, the
potential allergen, is in the taco shells.
</P>
<P>
   When the coalition announced its findings last Monday, Aventis
CropScience, which developed StarLink corn, challenged their
validity. And on Friday, it said Kraft's test might have confused
the unapproved corn with another ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that many tests detect only a single type of
modified grain. As the number of different genes put into plants
grows, testing for all of them could become burdensome. So a
labeling system could not be based solely on testing. Rather, crops
would have to be followed from seed through food processing with a
paper trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you know the history of the sample, you don't know what
you are testing for,'' said Eluned Jones, associate professor of
agriculture and agribusiness at Virginia Tech. ``It has to start at
the farm level. You can't just test it at the final level and put a
label on.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the practical problems, the food and biotechnology
industries themselves will have a strong interest in making crop
segregation and testing work. Genetic engineering is currently used
to make crops resistant to insects or herbicides, traits that have
little value to consumers. But biotech companies are working on
genetically modified crops to produce food oils lower in
artery-clogging fats, or tomatoes rich in cancer-fighting
substances. The industry will want those crops segregated and foods
made from them labeled.

BIG BROTHER IS PAINTING YOU

<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His 15 minutes of artistic fame may end Friday when the reality
series ``Big Brother'' names a winner and ends its three-month run
on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artist'' Tony Marsico appeared Sept. 6 on a live segment of
``Big Brother,'' which airs in prime time from a camera-laden,
wired-to-the-carpet-tacks home on a Studio City lot.
</P>
<P>
   The show's producers featured Marsico, 42, because he had been
selling (on the auction site eBay) paintings based on people from
the show, using primitive technique and bright colors.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than ``primitive,'' Marsico calls his technique
``crappy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a lot of reviews saying it's really crap,'' Marsico
says. ``Everyone says that, and yet they're selling like
hotcakes.''
</P>
<P>
   His creative regimen is equally as severe and exacting, says
Marsico. ``I do most of my paintings, in fact, sitting on the
couch, drinking a beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia native Marsico's ``real job'' is as a bassist who
has toured with Neil Young, Roger Daltrey and Willie Nelson. He
currently hits the road with singer-songwriter Matthew Sweet and
also appears with his swing band, the Hoagie Kings, Wednesdays at
Lola's in West Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   His paintings are just a sideline, one he indulges in his
studio, a 15-foot, 1962 Princess travel trailer. (His Web site is
www.badart.4t.com.)
</P>
<P>
   Marsico does each work in less than 10 minutes, including such
favorites as ``George Sits on Chiquita'' and ``Brittany Stands on
Head.'' His most profitable work was ``inspired'' by CBS'
``Survivor.'' ``Gay Rich Catches a Fish'' sold on eBay for $530.
</P>
<P>
   All the paintings are 5 by 7 inches, not because of aesthetics,
but because he buys cheap paintings from discount stores and carves
them up.
</P>
<P>
   Response from the ``Big Brother'' appearance has increased
demand, even though he put his first painting on eBay as a joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just ridiculous the prices I'm getting for my paintings.
I'd never sold a painting in my life. And the truth is, I'd never
tried to. I didn't even start out to. I just did this for fun.'' &QL;

Sega's console may fulfill gamers' dreams &QL; 
By David Bloom &QL; 
Staff Writer
</P>
<P>
   Despite the looming arrival of Sony's much-vaunted PlayStation 2
next month, and two more tough competitors in a year, Sega's
Dreamcast machine keeps rolling out a string of entertaining,
offbeat games, in some cases radically different from what's been
out there before.
</P>
<P>
   And after all, as this next generation of videogaming consoles
comes out over the next year -- with their eye-popping graphics and
amazing technical specifications -- it's still going to come down
to who has good games. Sega, first out of the gate and with the
least powerful tech specs, is making the most of its comparative
limitations with some fun games.
</P>
<P>
   One of the oddest is Seaman, which may be one of the more
uncategorizable games ever made. The voice of Leonard Nimoy greets
you as you enter a lab where a nautiluslike creature and others are
swimming.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, you'll seed the water with what become several
Seamen (no jokes, please). You have to regularly tweak the
temperature and oxygen of the water tank, and are expected to
interact regularly with your creatures as they grow.
</P>
<P>
   The game comes with a special microphone attachment that slips
into one of the two VMU slots on your Dreamcast controller. An
entire separate VMU also must be devoted to the game, given its
sophisticated demands for information storage.
</P>
<P>
   As the creatures grow, you talk with them, teaching them words
and interacting with them. To put it mildly, the Seamen, who are
essentially fish with faces, have an attitude, and will smart off
to you as they grow and learn a vocabulary of more than 1,000
words. The ultimate goal is to evolve your creatures out of the
tank.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a game? Well, maybe not strictly, but it !ital!is!off!
quite engaging. Best of all, there's no violence (though these
creatures do have a smart mouth) and nothing is getting blown up.
My young children, 9 and 8, found it as absorbing, in a bizarre
way, as did I. That's a very good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Another unusual Dreamcast title, also set underwater, is Ecco
the Dolphin: Defender of the Future.
</P>
<P>
   In it, everyone's favorite post-Flipper cetacean must fend off
an outer-space invasion. Controlling Ecco is delightfully
intuitive, and you can send him shooting out of the water to do
various flips and other tricks if you'd like. Of course, he does
have to breathe regularly, so there are practical reasons to send
him topside, too.
</P>
<P>
   I found the game beautiful to look at, with stunning and
realistic underwater backdrops based on National Geographic
photography.
</P>
<P>
   The gameplay itself emphasizes cooperation and nonviolent
approaches to problem solving. Again, it's a gentle alternative to
the usual explosions and mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   For those who like their games a little more adrenaline-laced, I
was quite engaged by two racing titles, one with plenty of goofy
nostalgia, the other straight from the arcades.
</P>
<P>
   Infogrames has recently come out with Wacky Races, which uses
the characters and high jinks from the old Hanna-Barbera
Saturday-morning cartoon. It's a fun and silly take on the combat
racing subgenre, as each of the characters has distinctive special
weapons it can use against its competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Dreamcast's graphic power (which is still prodigious
compared to anything other than the competition that still hasn't
hit the market) makes for really attractive visuals that more than
do justice to the original cartoon's stripped-down look.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Wacky Races is the kind of fun and somewhat different
game that can appeal to children while making parents happy. Up to
four can play at once, which makes it good for a rainy Sunday
afternoon, perhaps as a rental.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Midway has taken one of the installments of its
crackerjack Rush arcade-racing games, San Francisco Rush 2049, and
brought it to the Dreamcast.
</P>
<P>
   I was impressed with how easy it was to handle the customizable
race cars, a legacy of the game's arcade heritage. It still has the
basic arcade game structure, with 19 new tracks set in a futuristic
Frisco with tons of fun shortcuts that make the races more
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   The game also comes with a stunt mode and a battle mode that
provide their own alternative ways to have fun. I also found it
interesting how Midway is adding a bit of Internet connectivity to
the game by allowing you to download the best saved races and
compete against their ``ghosts'' on screen.
</P>
<P>
   As racing games go, this is a good one that will appeal to a
wide range of ages, given its great graphics, easy handling and fun
alternatives. And that, to my mind, makes for a set of very good
games. Maybe Sega's got a chance in this whole console war after
all. &QL;

   YUGO-ELECTIONS (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ With evidence mounting
of a sweeping triumph by the opposition, Vojislav Kostunica claimed
outright victory Monday over Slobodan Milosevic as Yugoslavia's new
president. But Kostunica and the opposition face difficult choices
about how to turn the claim into reality. Even if Kostunica's
assertion of a first-round victory is not accepted, Sunday's
elections could mark the beginning of the end of Milosevic's
13-year rule, which might begin to unravel quickly if the scope of
his defeat is verified. By Steven Erlanger.

   POVERTY-POLITICS (Undated) _ Poor people learn to keep hopes
small. So when President Clinton came calling on some of the
poorest places in the country last year with ideas to make things
better, it was like rain in the desert. The president's six-state,
four-day poverty tour, highlighting for the first time in his two
terms the places that remain untouched by the longest economic boom
in this nation's history, caused an excitement that bordered on the
spiritual. A year later, the president's modest proposals for tax
incentives to bring businesses to impoverished communities are
still awaiting Senate approval. The idea that anything big might
happen to places that have been down longer than they were ever up
has long faded. In dozens of interviews in communities that the
president visited _ Clarksdale, East St. Louis and the Eastern
Kentucky towns of Hazard and Annville _ what was clear is that
Democrats are Democrats, Republicans are Republicans and people are
more concerned with how to fix their own communities than in the
state of the country. By Evelyn Nieves.

NONVIOLENT CONSOLE COULD BE THE TICKET

<P>
   Despite the looming arrival of Sony's much-vaunted PlayStation 2
next month, and two more tough competitors in a year, Sega's
Dreamcast machine keeps rolling out a string of entertaining,
offbeat games, in some cases radically different from what's been
out there before.
</P>
<P>
   And after all, as this next generation of videogaming consoles
comes out over the next year -- with their eye-popping graphics and
amazing technical specifications -- it's still going to come down
to who has good games. Sega, first out of the gate and with the
least powerful tech specs, is making the most of its comparative
limitations with some fun games.
</P>
<P>
   One of the oddest is Seaman, which may be one of the more
uncategorizable games ever made. The voice of Leonard Nimoy greets
you as you enter a lab where a nautiluslike creature and others are
swimming.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, you'll seed the water with what become several
Seamen (no jokes, please). You have to regularly tweak the
temperature and oxygen of the water tank, and are expected to
interact regularly with your creatures as they grow.
</P>
<P>
   The game comes with a special microphone attachment that slips
into one of the two VMU slots on your Dreamcast controller. An
entire separate VMU also must be devoted to the game, given its
sophisticated demands for information storage.
</P>
<P>
   As the creatures grow, you talk with them, teaching them words
and interacting with them. To put it mildly, the Seamen, who are
essentially fish with faces, have an attitude, and will smart off
to you as they grow and learn a vocabulary of more than 1,000
words. The ultimate goal is to evolve your creatures out of the
tank.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a game? Well, maybe not strictly, but it !ital!is!off!
quite engaging. Best of all, there's no violence (though these
creatures do have a smart mouth) and nothing is getting blown up.

</P>
<P>
   Another unusual Dreamcast title, also set underwater, is Ecco
the Dolphin: Defender of the Future.
</P>

an outer-space invasion. Controlling Ecco is delightfully
intuitive, and you can send him shooting out of the water to do
various flips and other tricks if you'd like. Of course, he does
have to breathe regularly, so there are practical reasons to send
him topside, too.
</P>
<P>
   I found the game beautiful to look at, with stunning and
realistic underwater backdrops based on National Geographic
photography.
</P>
<P>
   The gameplay itself emphasizes cooperation and nonviolent
approaches to problem solving. Again, it's a gentle alternative to
the usual explosions and mayhem.
</P>

BARAK AND ARAFAT MEET, HOPING TO EASE STRAINED RELATIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In an effort to improve a strained relationship,
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian
leader, met Monday night for the first time since the Camp David
peace talks ended two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian officials do not expect anything
tangible to come from the closed-door, late-night meeting. They do
not presume to hope that the deadlock in the faltering peace
negotiations will be broken.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, relations have deteriorated to the point where a mere
meeting of the leaders is considered progress, and especially one
held in an intimate setting _ in Barak's private home in the
central Israeli town of Kochav Yair, according to the Israeli
radio.
</P>
<P>
   Although the location was kept secret until the meeting began,
Jewish settlers gathered outside to protest, forcing Arafat to
enter through the backdoor.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Barak has been insisting that there is no point in a
meeting if Arafat will not agree in advance to consider American
proposals to bridge the differences between them, especially on the
seemingly intractable issue of Jerusalem's status. But under
pressure from American officials and from dovish Israeli ministers,
particularly Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, Barak dropped his
precondition.
</P>
<P>
   After the Kochav Yair meeting, senior Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators are expected to fly to Washington for talks in the next
few days. American mediators have prepared a working paper that
summarizes points of concord and differences between the parties
and suggests solutions, but it is unclear whether they will use the
document.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli newspaper Haaretz said Monday that Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright informed Barak and Foreign Minister Shlomo
Ben Ami over the weekend that the Americans were going to hold off
on presenting the document. The newspaper said the Americans had
identified too many disparities on almost every issue to formulate
a workable overall proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Ami visited Amman, Jordan, and Cairo Monday to promote the
idea of entrusting the sacred heart of the Old City, known to Jews
as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram al Sharif, to the
United Nations Security Council to resolve conflicting Israeli and
Palestinian demands for sovereignty over the site.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in English to reporters, Ben Ami announced, ``There is
going to be an agreement this week!'' Quickly, he corrected himself
and said he had meant a meeting, not an agreement. Then he repeated
his mistake, laughing and saying his dual slips revealed how badly
he wanted to see a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Barak told his cabinet this weekend that he would be willing to
accept a partial deal with the Palestinians that set a time line
for resolving unresolved issues, like Jerusalem. Haaretz endorsed
this idea in an editorial Monday as a way to ``prevent a crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Palestinians have rejected both the proposal for United
Nations control over the site and the idea of a partial agreement.
</P>
<P>
   If Monday night's meeting is meant to re-establish a link
between the two leaders, that will be no easy feat. A senior
American official said recently that Arafat never cottoned to
Barak's terse military manner, and that the Americans constantly
find themselves trying to interpret Barak's intentions to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammed Rachid, a senior economic adviser to Arafat, said
rapport between the two leaders never gelled. This summer, right
before Camp David, Rachid said Barak always gave the impression
that he thought he was smarter than anyone else in the room; and
maybe he was, Rachid allowed.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak made it clear that he felt that if he just had several
minutes alone with each individual, he could convince them that his
way was right for everybody, Rachid said.
</P>
<P>
   And, Rachid suggested, that is not a good way to do business
with Arafat.

RULING BOOSTS COLLEGES' RIGHT TO DISCIPLINE STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICK HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Ruling that colleges can sharply limit the legal rights
of students, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Monday upheld
Brandeis University's closed-door disciplinary system that had been
challenged by a former student found guilty of sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   In a 3-to-2 verdict for Brandeis, the majority of judges said
colleges may discipline and punish students as they saw fit,
without interference from the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A university is not required to adhere to the standards of due
process guaranteed to criminal defendants or to abide by the rules
of evidence adopted by courts,'' the majority ruled.
</P>
<P>
   College officials nationwide were relieved by Monday's ruling.
Even though it only applies to Massachusetts colleges, the decision
could set a precedent for schools everywhere when they seek a free
hand in dealing with charges of student misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Alan D. Rose, the lead attorney for Brandeis, called Monday's
decision a victory for parents as well as colleges. ``Now
administrators who believe a student has misbehaved can punish the
student quickly, without fear that a court will come in and second
guess them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But David M. Lipton, the lawyer for the accused student, David
Schaer _ who sued Brandeis for allegedly denying him a fair hearing
_ said the ruling is a blow to students' rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were the parent of a student going to a Massachusetts
university, I'd be extremely worried about whether I could expect
fair treatment,'' Lipton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Schaer case has transfixed the university legal community
since it was filed in 1996, because of the controversial nature of
campus judiciary panels, and the few court decisions on how a
university can mete out punishment. At bottom, the case was about
date rape, a problem almost all campuses face.
</P>
<P>
   Schaer was accused of having sex with a female Brandeis student
without her consent. He said it was consensual.
</P>
<P>
   The two dated and had been lovers during the summer of 1995, but
had broken up when the female student called Schaer in February
1996 and asked him to come to her dorm room. There, according to
the woman's complaint, they kissed, but she told him that she ``did
not want to have sex.'' At some point, she fell asleep, but later
woke up and allegedly found Schaer having sex with her.
</P>
<P>
   About six weeks later, the woman filed a complaint against
Schaer with the student judiciary system. Brandeis, like many
colleges, allows a panel of students and faculty member to act as
both judge and jury in handling misconduct complaints.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of five students and two professors found that Schaer
engaged in ``unwanted sexual activity'' and had created a hostile
environment. A junior at the time, Schaer was put on academic
probation for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Schaer sued Brandeis in June 1996. In a seven-count complaint,
he charged that the university violated his civil rights and
bungled its own disciplinary process, denying him a fair chance to
defend himself.
</P>
<P>
   A state judge dismissed his complaint, but a state appeals court
found that one count should go forward to trial _ Schaer's claim
that Brandeis erred in handling his case.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Judicial Court, in its decision Monday, analyzed
only that finding by the appellate court, which had cited five
mistakes by Brandeis:
</P>
<P>
   _ It did not make a ``careful evaluation'' of the facts in the
case, or the credibility of those reporting them;
</P>
<P>
   _ It failed to write a detailed record of the hearing, reducing
the testimony by 13 witnesses _ who spoke over the course of five
hours _ to 12 lines of text;
</P>
<P>
   _ It allowed the use of ``irrelevant and inflammatory''
evidence;
</P>
<P>
   _ It did not base the decision on whether the evidence met a
``clear and convincing'' standard;
</P>
<P>
   _ It violated Schaer's rights to due process.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge majority sided with Brandeis, saying a section
of its conduct code about students' ``rights'' does not guarantee
an opportunity for students to defend themselves against misconduct
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in this section requires university officials to
obtain an interview from the accused student, to seek evidence from
the accused student, or to grant the accused student an opportunity
to provide witnesses at the investigatory stage,'' the decision
stated.
</P>
<P>
   Schaer's complaint about the brief, written record of the
Brandeis hearing was also discarded. Nothing in Brandeis's
procedures required ``a more complete report,'' even though one
would have been preferable, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissent, Justice Roderick L. Ireland said that Brandeis had
a loose set of rules to judge misconduct, and that even these rules
weren't followed in the Schaer cas.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a hearing on a serious disciplinary matter there is simply
too much at stake for an individual student to countenance the
university's failure to abide by the rules it has itself
articulated,'' Ireland said.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary panels like Brandeis's often come under scrutiny and
attack, seen by critics as ``star chambers'' where accused students
are not permitted lawyers and may have limited rights to present
evidence and question witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But college officials believe these panels provide a jury of
peers for students, and are part of the educational experience that
campuses provide outside of the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   The Brandeis panel is made up of five students and two
professors, who act as both judge and jury, setting the rules and
recommending sanctions to the dean of students. The dean then metes
out the punishment, which may be greater or lesser than suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Schaer, in an interview Monday, recalled that he walked into his
hearing in April 1996 already branded as a rapist on campus.
Without a lawyer or a system of evidence to protect his rights, he
listened as a campus police officer testified that the female
student ``looked like a rape victim'' a month after the alleged
incident took place. One student was allowed to call Schaer an
``egotistical bastard.''
</P>
<P>
   Schaer said Monday he was ``dumbfounded'' by the court's
decision. ``I thought the law was on our side here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheldon Steinbach, general counsel for the American Council
on Education, a national umbrella group for colleges, said colleges
_ especially private schools _ had the right to set their own
policies and enforce them as they chose.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what the rules of the game are when you enroll,''
Steinbach said. ``If you don't like the process at a private
university, you can always go somewhere else.''

COMMENTARY: GORE'S OIL PLAN WON'T FREE US FROM OPEC
</HEADLINE>
  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
  TOKYO _  It's interesting watching the American oil crisis/debate
from here in Tokyo. The Japanese are cool as cucumbers today _ no
oil protests, no gas lines, no politicians making crazy promises.
That's because Japan has been preparing for this day since the 1973
oil crisis by steadily introducing natural gas, nuclear power,
high-speed mass transit and conservation, and thereby steadily
reducing its dependence on foreign oil. And unlike the U.S., the
Japanese never wavered from that goal by falling off the wagon and
becoming addicted to SUVs _ those they just make for the
Americans. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine if America had that sort of steely focus. Imagine, in
fact, if at this time of soaring oil prices and endangered
environments, America had a presidential candidate who could offer
a realistic plan for how to preserve our earth in the balance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute _ that was supposed to be Al Gore, but in the heat
of the campaign Gore has shamelessly offered us instead a
fly-by-night plan for putting America out of balance. The new Gore
energy theory is to demonize the oil companies, tap into the
nation's strategic oil reserve _ which only a few months ago he
declared shouldn't be touched to manipulate prices _ and talk about
developing new magic energy-saving technologies that will create
jobs in the swing states where Gore needs to get elected and will
allow Americans to keep driving gas-guzzling big cars and indulging
their same energy-consuming habits without pain.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How nice! How easy! And how far from what's really required to
free us from the grip of OPEC. Here is how we got into this pickle,
which you won't hear from Gore:
</P>
<P>
   OPEC came along in the 1970s and pushed the crude oil price up
too far too fast, and it created a global economic slowdown,
triggering both energy conservation and widespread new exploration
outside of OPEC. The result was an oversupply of oil from 1981 to
1998 _ culminating in 1998 with oil falling to $10 a barrel, when
the glut coincided with Asia's economic crisis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This cheap oil lulled us into retreating from conservation, and
was like a huge tax cut. And because it coincided with the
technology revolution, it added to the booming U.S. economy, which
helped fuel a world economic recovery. But this boom eventually
stretched OPEC's capacity for quality oil, used up most of the
world's oil tankers and once again pushed up prices. As such, today
we either have to start to consume less oil _ by shrinking our
SUV's, raising gasoline taxes and again taking conservation
seriously _ or find more non-OPEC oil, which means figuring out how
to tap more of Alaska's huge natural gas reserves without spoiling
Alaska's pristine environment. Or else we pay the price.
</P>
<P>
   Gore knows this, but instead of laying it on the line he opted
for an Olympic-quality, full-body pander _ offering a quick fix to
garner votes, and pain-free solutions for the future. Prime the
pumps, pump the polls and pay later. Don't get me wrong, tapping
the strategic reserve makes some sense to ease the current
distribution crisis _ but doing it without also offering a real
program for consuming less oil and finding more makes no sense at
all.
</P>
<P>
   It's also dangerous. Another name for the Gore strategy would be
``The Saddam Hussein Rehabilitation Act of 2000.`` Because tapping
into the strategic reserve, without conservation or exploration,
only guarantees OPEC's dominance. And when the oil market remains
tight, it means that Saddam is in an ideal position to hold America
hostage. Any time he threatens to take any of his oil off the
market, he can make the price soar.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's oil pander also reminds many Democrats of what it is that
bothers them about the vice president. Many Democrats really are
not wild about him, yet they know they have to vote for him over
Bush. They would at least like to feel good about that vote.
</P>
<P>
   But when you hear Gore bleating that ``I will work for the day
when we are free forever of the dominance of big oil and foreign
oil'' _ without leveling with Americans that the only way to do
that is by us consuming less and drilling more _ you just want to
cover your ears. Surely Gore is better than that. Surely Gore
supporters are entitled to expect more from him. I guess all they
can hope for now is that he will show more spine and intellectual
honesty as a president than he has as a candidate. You really start
to wonder, though.

A NEW PORT OF CALL: PANAMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 1)  
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like children with their noses pressed up against a candy-store
window, Panamanian tourism officials had watched with longing and
frustration as cruise ships full of tourists glided tantalizingly
through the canal on their way to the Caribbean or South America.
But starting this month, vacationers who would have seen Panama
only from a ship's railing finally will be able to go ashore when
Panama inaugurates Colon 2000, a $45 million cruise ship port on
the Caribbean entrance to the legendary canal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The project, a joint venture between the Panamanian Government
and a private developer, is a major advance in Panama's quest to
transform its image and economy since the United States handed over
the last of its military bases on Dec. 31. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While other projects in the former Canal Zone have been geared
to the more mundane businesses of shipping and cargo, backers of
Colon 2000 hope to lure tourists ashore with the promise of
duty-free shopping to the accompaniment of music and folk dancing
at a two-story, 190,000-square-foot mall and a 150-room Radisson
Hotel, scheduled to open in June.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eighty port calls are already expected for the first year, by
ships from Carnival, Celebrity Cruises, Holland America and
Princess Cruises. Visitors can go fishing or golfing near Colon, or
even dash down to Panama City at the canal's Pacific entrance and
tour the Canal Museum or shop at the handicrafts market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the only port of call that can offer a shore excursion
that would include a tour of both the Caribbean and the Pacific.''
said Augusto Terracina, the marketing manager for Colon 2000.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lush lands along the canal's route boast bird sanctuaries
and eco-tourism resorts. An odd transformation has taken place at
the former School of the Americas, the controversial finishing
school for Latin American military leaders, which the Spanish hotel
chain Sol Melia has converted into a secluded resort on Gatun Lake
near Colon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are security concerns for tourists. The city, which was a
boom town during the canal's construction between 1904 and 1914,
has many rundown areas rife with crime. Panamanians hope the new
projects will create jobs and ease unemployment. Although tourism
officials are hopeful enough about Colon that they will offer tours
of its old section, some Panamanians are doubtful that the city's
fortunes have improved enough to make it attractive to tourists. At
any rate, it is not the kind of place where tourists should wander
alone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The city's grim sections are in contrast to the commercial buzz
inside the Colon Free Trade Zone, the biggest in the world after
Hong Kong. Panamanian officials are taking advantage of the port's
proximity to the free zone to offer bargains in everything from
electronics to Gucci. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The prices tourists are going to find here will be much better
than in other ports because we have the free trade zone which
distributes to the Caribbean,'' Terracina said. ``St. Thomas is one
of the most popular shopping ports. Well, we distribute to St.
Thomas. That right there would save the passenger lots of money.''

BUSH SAYS GORE PLAN WON'T REDUCE EDUCATION WOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Repeating the words ``recession'' and
``stagnation'' nearly a dozen times in an hour, George W. Bush
Monday tried to blunt the political impact of the booming national
economy by warning of a mounting education crisis that his opponent
has failed to fix.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, encouraged by poll numbers that show him again running
even with the vice president, sought to close the gender gap that
has separated him from Al Gore, focusing on an issue that
traditionally plays well with women. But in doing so, the Texas
governor walked a fine ideological line: Between holding the
federal government accountable for public education failures, and
saying that educational policy should be dictated mainly at the
local level.
</P>
<P>
   Bush blamed Gore for not taking a more active role in closing
the ``achievement gap'' between rich and poor children in public
schools, and pledged to improve standards in ``every public school
in America'' if elected president. Yet Bush also embraced a more
traditional Republican line, saying that as president he would not
expect the government to manage expensive problems such as teacher
shortages or crowded classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush pointed to his home state as an example of what
can be accomplished with proper leadership at the local level,
saying that test scores for minority students in Texas have risen
in recent years. The Gore campaign immediately disputed the claim,
but it did not stop Bush from accomplishing his mission of Monday
morning: Discussing, without distraction, an issue he has made
central to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Across this country entrepreneurs and small businesses are
creating jobs in record numbers,'' Bush told a select crowd
gathered in at the Bethany Elementary School in Beaverton, a suburb
of Portland. ``And yet there are some warning signs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The most significant warning sign is the achievement gap in
our public schools between rich and poor, Anglo and minority,'' he
said. ``There is an education recession in America that threatens
our future.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government pays for about seven percent of all
public school funding.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's new ``education recession'' catch phrase _ imprinted on
glossy new pamphlets distributed at his campaign stop _ is one the
Republican nominee plans to repeat in the Democratic stronghold of
California and again as he moves into Midwestern swing states later
in the week.
</P>
<P>
   He is scheduled to travel to a total of five states this week,
taking some time off on Wednesday in Austin to practice for next
week's presidential debate in Boston. Bush is also planning to hold
another mock debate this weekend with Senator Judd Gregg,
Republican of New Hampshire, playing the part of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, though, the focus appeared to be on simply getting out a
consistent message, continuing his recovery from a month of
slipping poll numbers and verbal gaffes. Although he met with a
local newspaper editorial board in Oregon, Bush continued a new
policy of selective silence with the media, declining to hold an
open news conference with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the Bush education plan is accountability _ a
requirement he says the Clinton administration has virtually
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal, which would cost $47.6 billion over 10 years,
would require schools that receive federal funding for poor
students to administer state-determined tests to see if they are
improving each year. If schools don't improve after three years,
the federal funding would be redirected to parents, who could spend
it on sending their children to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   But parents would receive a voucher worth only about $1,500 _
thousands less than the cost of most private schools. Even a Bush
education advisor, B. Alexander Kress, conceded the federal money
would not fully cover the cost of sending a child to private
school. Instead, the Bush proposal is designed primarily to send a
warning to failing urban schools _ either improve, or risk losing
federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   Other key elements of the Bush plan include creating more
charter schools, increasing federal funding on teachers, and moving
Head Start, the federally-funded program for health and social
services, into the Department of Education. Bush would not carry
out the Clinton plan to hire 100,000 new teachers to reduce class
size, instead leaving that to each state.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has outlined a $115 billion, 10-year plan to continue the
existing Clinton education agenda, as well to expand teacher
salaries and benefits. At the center of the vice president's plan
is a $50 billion proposal to make sure every 4-year-old has access
to preschool.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides immediately pounced on the Bush proposal, saying
that, despite its relatively small size, the Texas governor had no
mechanism to pay for it and still offer his $1.3 trillion tax cut.
The Democrats also quarreled with Bush's account of his success in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need to look beyond the borders of Texas to see the
governor has failed when it comes to education,'' Gore spokesman
Chris Lehane said. ``They're not suffering from an education
recession, they're suffering from an education depression.''

   TRAVEL-CRUISE-TRENDS (Undated) _ This year is shaping up as a
record for the cruise industry with the number of passengers
possibly exceeding 7 million. A major reason is the many low fares.
The reason for such bargains is not a mystery: almost 80 new ships
joined the North American fleet during the 1990s, and 52 more are
scheduled by 2005. To offset the low fare, some lines have added
more charges on board and have come up with even more competitive
cruises. Coming up is a floating health club from Canyon Ranch and
nearly 2,000 short cruises. By Edwin McDowell.

<P>
   PRACTICAL-TRAVELER-CRUISE-REFUNDS (Undated) _ On Sept. 14, with
2,800 passengers aboard five vessels in the Bahamas, Cozumel,
Mexico, and Nova Scotia, Premier Cruises was shut down, seized by
creditors. For Betsy Wade, this was more than a news story. In June
she was a Premier passenger when the air conditioning failed on the
Big Red Boat en route to Nova Scotia. Passengers were put on a bus
and sent back to New York. Ever since then she had been trying to
get a refund. Now she finds she is in a really big boat _ 7,000
passengers are due refunds. By Betsy Wade.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-CRUISE-SENIORS (Undated) _ In her youth, Barbara
Delatiner, confesses to a bias against
if-this-is-Tuesday-it-must-be-Copenhagen trips. As for a cruise,
for ``mature'' travelers, she was concerned it would resemble a
floating retirement home. Twelve days after boarding the Norwegian
Dream, she disembarked with mixed feelings. She enjoyed the
pampering aboard ship, preferred having a cabin to living out of a
suitcase on a land tour and had some memories that will last a
lifetime. But she found the time on shore rushed to the point she
figured out she had about five seconds per painting at the
Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. By Barbara Delatiner.

   TRAVEL-STEAMBOAT (UNDATED) _ One blast of the American Queen's

GORE SEEKS SUPPORT IN UNCERTAIN STATE OF FLORIDA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Even as she entered the auditorium
Monday, even as she smiled at the chance to see the vice president
in person, Tess Laurente was unsure.
</P>
<P>
   Gore or Bush? Republican or Democrat? With the presidential
election just six weeks away, Laurente said her single vote was as
much a toss-up as the entire state of Florida's suddenly appears to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't say right now,'' said Laurent, 64, a nurse who
plans to retire next March and puts Medicare and Social Security
benefits at the top of her voting agenda. ``I want to make sure I'm
in good hands, so I'll listen to Mr. Gore today and maybe Mr. Bush
the next time he comes around.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurente is likely to get a go at the Texas governor. With
Florida, once considered a lock for George W. Bush, now
unexpectedly up for grabs for a variety of reasons, both candidates
have been putting in as many appearances as possible. While
unwilling to give the November election to Gore just yet, if at
all, political observers said recent polls have forced the Bush
campaign to divert time and attention to a state it considered a
given.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was betting, I'd still have to bet that George Bush will
win the state,'' said Aubrey Jewett, an assistant professor of
political science at the University of Central Florida in Orlando.
``But clearly it's going to be tight, tight, tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was in St. Petersberg Monday to tout his proposals for
seniors, playing to the largely elderly crowd from the start by
describing his wife, Tipper, as the grandmother of his grandson.
The topic _ Medicare _ was meant to appeal. The speakers were
turned up extra loud, and still the clapping sometimes drowned out
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fighting for the seniors of America, the people who have
worked hard all their lives, paid their taxes, and deserve some
peace and security in their older years,'' Gore said to wild
applause at the Coliseum, where a pink sign outside advertised
Wednesday afternoon tea dances.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors are a key constituency in Florida, where almost 20
percent of the residents are age 65 or older. They're among the
most consistent voters, too, with political observers in the state
saying that they typically constitute as much as 35 percent of
election day turnout. Now, apparently impressed by his sweeping
proposals for prescription drug plans and his guarantee that Social
Security will survive in its familiar form, a good number of them
appear to be turning toward Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In a state where his opponent's father won in 1992 and his
brother Jeb is now governor, and where the state House and Senate
are both Republican, other factors may be working to Gore's
advantage, too. As Jewett explained, Gore's New Democrat moderate
line on some issues appeals to many Florida voters, as President
Clinton's did in 1996 when Florida went into his reelection column.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's nomination of Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut as his
running mate also helped solidify the Democratic base in
southeastern Florida, although that section of the state was
expected to support him anyway, political analysts said. Bush is
expected to win southwestern and northern Florida, leaving the
midsection known as the I-4 corridor after its highway as the
current campaign battleground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida has always been a pretty competitive state,''
particularly in statewide races, said Thomas Carsey, an associate
professor of political science at Florida State University in
Tallahassee. ``There are roughly equal numbers of people who
identify themselves as Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Florida has always had a different Democratic mix compared
with other states,'' he added, ``so the Republican gains in the New
South are muted a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, for instance, Miami's large Cuban population voted
Republican. But, analysts said, US-born Cubans tend to be at least
slightly more liberal than their immigrant,
anti-Castro-at-all-costs parents. In Central Florida, the newcomers
include Puerto Ricans and an increasing number of
Mexican-Americans, a population that has tended to vote Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Carsey put it, ``two or three months ago, it would
have been stunning if the state went to Gore because Jeb Bush is
governor. Now it would only be surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, most of the people who made their way to the
Coliseum in Monday's early afternoon broil were Gore supporters.
Like Eloise Harrington, a 53-year-old account manager for a credit
reporting firm who paid $10 for a Gore-Lieberman 2000 T-shirt, many
did say they themselves were surprised by Gore's newfound
popularity in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people I know say they're going to go Democratic for
the first time,'' Harrington said. ``I think Gore's got a great
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people James Whaley knows, however, remain
undecided, except for what he called dyed-in-the-wool Democrats.
Even his Republican pals are uncertain, as is he. Whaley did not
attend Gore's speech, which was invitation only.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could be for Al, but he's got to do something rather than
just be for something -- not that George Bush is going to do
something,'' said Whaley, 57, a hotel limousine driver originally
from Missouri and a Clinton supporter in 1996. ``He did pick a
great running mate, though. But I'm still going to take my time to
decide.''

DEFEATED BY BALLOT, MILOSEVIC REFUSES TO CONCEDE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a sweeping electoral defeat looming, President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia Monday resisted world pressure to
concede _ or even to jump immediately into a runoff with opposition
candidate Vojislav Kostunica.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and most of the European governments
warned Milosevic against trying to use fraud to change the ballot
results, which come after his 13 years at the helm have left his
state shrunken and, after the Kosovo war, snubbed.
</P>
<P>
   Exuberant crowds swelled in Belgrade and other Yugoslav cities
to celebrate the election results. At least a day before the
government was to announce the tally, some of the roughly 30,000
opposition supporters in Belgrade chanted, ``Kill yourself Slobodan
and save Serbia!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowds are growing much larger,'' said a European
diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The point is these
celebrations should not turn out to lead to any problems because
then Milosevic can say, `This is instability; I must take power.'
But I think the event is so big now. Everyone is trying to guess
what Milosevic's next move will be. But he's never looked so
vulnerable as now.''
</P>
<P>
   As senior US officials deliberated on how to respond to the
surprisingly strong showing by the opposition, P.J. Crowley,
spokesman for the National Security Council, called on Milosevic to
accept the ``credible reports'' of his apparent defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether the government will listen,'' Crowley
said.
</P>
<P>
   The belief among senior US officials, diplomats, and political
analysts was that Milosevic had never looked so vulnerable. But
they also believed that the odds were extremely slim that he would
step down voluntarily, and could attempt to stall the process as he
did in 1996 in hopes of shoring up his support among the military
and oligarchy. Washington has invested $77 million in bolstering
the opposition by supplying computers and fax machines, training
organizers, and paying for sophisticated polling.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition candidate Kostunica, speaking to reporters, said he
was sure he had won the first round of voting.
</P>
<P>
   If forces loyal to Milosevic attempt to change the outcome _ a
feat that by the opposition's reckoning would mean tampering with
hundreds of thousands of ballots _ Kotunica said, ``We will defend
our victory by peaceful means and we will protest for as long as it
takes.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, using unofficial results from about 60 percent
of the polling stations, said Kostunica was leading Milosevic by 55
percent to 34 percent, a result supported by the independent Center
for Free Elections and Democracy, which put Kostunica's lead at 57
percent to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the ruling Socialist coalition offered their own count that
put Milosevic in the lead with 45 percent and Kostunica with 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even as glum looking Socialist party leaders were shown on
state-owned television, Milosevic's party general secretary, Gorica
Gajevica, declared Milosevic was in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This result gives us optimism that we can win in the first
round,'' Gajevica said. But the spokesman did not claim that
Milosevic would win 50 percent of the tally, the percentage needed
to stave off a second round of voting. A runoff election, if it was
set, would be held Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Ljudisa Ristic, the spokesman for the president of the Yugoslav
United Left Party, said figures showed Milosevic could win the
first round, but if there were a runoff election, ``The will of the
people will be respected.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Yugoslav electoral commission shut down operations
Sunday night _ and ejected representatives of the opposition _
results were not expected at least until Tuesday. Wednesday is the
deadline for results, under Yugoslav law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing Milosevic wants is time right now,'' said a
senior Pentagon official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
``He wants another two weeks for the runoff. We think it's
significant that the party didn't even try to declare a first
ballot victory.''
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, Bane Andjelich, owner of the independent Web site
www.beograd.com, said in a telephone interview that opposition
candidates had won overwhelming victories in local council
contests, including winning an unofficial 119 out of 120 seats in
the capital.
</P>
<P>
   As for the presidential contest, ``The ruling coalition is
trying to wiggle their way out of things,'' said Andjelich. ``They
are trying to find a way of hanging on to some power without being
too obvious. This will be the first time in Serbian history that
the government has been changed in election polls. People didn't
believe it was possible.''
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Samuel R. Berger briefed President
Clinton on the elections over the telephone as the president flew
from California to New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's increasingly apparent that the opposition has prevailed
in that election and any claims by Milosevic to contrary are
false,'' White House spokesman Jake Siewert said.
</P>
<P>
   As a sweetener to forces opposing Milosevic, the State
Department Monday said that the United State would lift sanctions
if the opposition is declared winner of the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the democratic change occurs, we will take steps to lift
sanctions,'' said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher. The
sanctions include blocking international bank loans to Yugoslavia,
an oil embargo and denying visas to Yugoslav officials.
</P>
<P>
   One of Milosevic's problems now is that he has nowhere to turn
after being indicted as committing war crimes in Kosovo by a Hague
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Dusko Doder, who wrote the 1999 biography ``Milosevic: Portrait
of a Tyrant,'' said it was unlikely that the Yugoslav leader would
buckle under international pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's going to stall a while, temporize a bit, but he
can't leave _ that's the problem,'' Doder said. ``There's no
face-saving gesture. He faces jail.''
</P>
<P>
   But Eric Gordy, a sociology professor at Clark University who
wrote ``The Culture of Power in Serbia,'' said ``it's hard to tell
what the regime gains by waiting two more weeks for an election.
It's already been a while now that people opposed to Milosevic
aren't afraid of him anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic,'' said Gordy, ``can only steal this election if
people who support him are afraid of him, and that we don't know.''

 &HT;    SENATE OK'S BILL FOR EVERGLADES RESTORATION
 &HT;    500&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Monday overwhelmingly approved a
comprehensive, $7.8 billion plan to restore the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   The bill still must be approved by the House, where an unrelated
fight over prevailing wages on other water projects threatens final
action.
</P>
<P>
   The bill provides a blueprint for a joint federal-state project
to replumb the South Florida ecosystem. It would restore much of
the water flow that historically fed the southern part of the
state, and provide additional water for agriculture and the
region's growing population.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would create a system to retain and gradually release
water now largely being diverted to the Atlantic Ocean, plus a
series of deep-well storage areas and untested technology designed
to improve water quality throughout the ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's 85-1 vote came on a bill to authorize $3.9 billion
worth of water development projects for the next two years.
Included in the bill, at a cost of $1.1 billion, were the first 10
of 68 Everglades restoration projects and four related pilot
projects costing $69 million.
</P>
<P>
   Portions of the plan are designed to be altered as new
technology and new methods are developed over the next several
decades. The plan is not expected to be completed until at least
2036.
</P>
<P>
   With lawmakers hoping to adjourn by Oct. 6, action now moves to
the House, where Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., has introduced a
bill virtually identical to the Senate's provisions.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after the Senate vote, Shaw said he was
confident the Everglades bill would be adopted, but was unclear as
to how the bill would reach a final vote.
</P>
<P>
   The initial plan will be to allow the House Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee to consider the water bill. But if that
bill becomes entangled in unrelated disputes, Shaw said, he would
attempt to pass the Everglades provisions either as a individual
bill or as part of other comprehensive legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the goofy season'' as Congress races toward
adjournment, Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   A possible roadblock in the House involves efforts by Democratic
lawmakers to guarantee that federal water projects pay prevailing
union-scale wages similar to those paid on federal transportation
projects. Republican lawmakers oppose those efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, the sole dissenting vote came from James M.
Inhofe, R-Okla., who warned that the cost of the Everglades
legislation ``is really open-ended ... and it could cost a
tremendous amount of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from both parties noted that the Everglades plan is
the largest environmental restoration project ever attempted in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., who as governor initiated the state's
Save Our Everglades effort in the early 1980s, called the bill a
major step in ``overturning 120 years of attempts to convert the
Everglades from a unique ecosystem into a pedestrian ecosystem'' so
that ``we can leave to our children and grandchildren an Everglades
... (that is) unique, unprecedented and special.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., who chairs the Environment and Public
Works Committee that shepherded the bill to passage, noted that
lawmakers from both parties cooperated on passage despite the fact
that Florida was being fiercely contested in the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is enough credit to go around. Let the credit fall where
it may,'' Smith said. ``The truth is we did the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., who telephoned Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla.,
at a post-passage news conference to extend his congratulations,
issued a statement applauding the Senate action and calling on the
House to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's passage of legislation saving the Florida Everglades
by the United States Senate represents a major step toward
restoration of one of America's greatest natural treasures,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Representing the Clinton administration, Environmental
Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner _ who was born and
raised in Miami _ praised Clinton and Vice President Al Gore for
supporting a workable restoration plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commitment we make today is about ensuring that the heart
of the Everglades will pulse again with clear, fresh, abundant
water,'' Browner said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups also hailed the outcome as one sought for
several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Decades of acrimony have been set aside, and we now are
working together to pass legislation that will restore the
quantity, quality, timing and distribution of water to America's
Everglades,'' said Daniel P. Beard, senior vice president of the
National Audubon Society. ``The single greatest threat to
restoration of America's Everglades remains the lack of time left
in this congressional session.''
</P>
<P>
   As the linchpin of the deal between the state and the federal
government, the bill shares the cost of building and maintaining
the restoration projects equally between the federal and state
governments.
</P>
<P>
   An attempt by Sens. John Warner, R-Va. and George Voinovich,
R-Ohio, to force Florida to pay the full cost of operation and
maintenance of the Everglades projects once they are completed was
rejected last week on a 71-24 vote.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate agreed to a provision inserted by Voinovich
expressing concern about the planned conversion of Homestead Air
Force Base into a regional commercial airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty strong language,'' Voinovich said. ``It's about as
strong as we could get without killing it.''

 &HT;    Should Congress tame daytime TV? No, but outrage should
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every time Washington talks about reining in entertainment it
shows how out of touch it is.
</P>
<P>
   Question, viewers. What's the biggest problem with daytime
television? Is it:
</P>
<P>
   (A) Blood-and-guts violence?
</P>
<P>
   (B) Testimonials from slack-jawed low-lifes about their sexual
perversity, packaged with on-stage fist fights?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is B _ as in, Jerry Springer, please B gone, and take
your mutant strain of trash-talk TV with you.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting and odd that last week the Senate Commerce
Committee voted for a bill that would ban TV shows with graphic
bloodshed or gratuitous violence from daytime hours, creating a
``safe harbor'' for unwatched children who watch too much blood and
gore.
</P>
<P>
   Troll the harbor, however, and find that if one removed blood
and gore from the daytime offerings, one would find much else that
is just as destructive, like what Springer, Jenny Jones and others
dish out.
</P>
<P>
   Government control of Springer? That's a hard case to make with
free speech the most fundamental freedom we have. Would a
government board sit in judgment of every word uttered by
Springer's low-rent guests? How about all those Einsteins in the
studio audience?
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't. Government should tread lightly on regulating
speech over the air waves. It has the authority to do so, as those
airwaves are regulated. But when it gets in the business of picking
and choosing acceptable thoughts, it is treading on a most basic
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, government chooses a sticky wicket trying to determine
what shows are too violent for day-time. Cartoons? Reality cop
shows?
</P>
<P>
   Government is in no position to discriminate for viewers (and
parents) who should be doing the discriminating.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to influence TV is to influence the networks or the
advertisers through the marketplace of ideas. Viewers must voice
their outrage. Networks and individual channels must realize their
role in shaping what kind of society we have.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end the responsibility is parents'. Government can't
protect us from every vile influence, nor should we expect it.

 &HT;    Questions of campaign deception bugging Rove
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stakes were high, and crucial information seemed to be
leaking from the Republican camp to the Democratic camp. The big
debate was upcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Finger-pointing and blame-throwing ensued. Each side implicated
the other. The feds were called in.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 1986 Texas gubernatorial race, and key players
involved then are involved now as a similar scenario unfolds. The
FBI is trying to figure out how a tape of GOP presidential nominee
George W. Bush's debate preparation wound up in the hands of an
adviser to Democratic nominee Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Some Texas Democrats are suggesting _ while reminding reporters
Monday of the earlier event _ the similarities between the latest
flap and the one 14 years ago are more than coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's vintage Republican, and I say that as a former
Republican,'' said Texas Democratic Chair Molly Beth Malcolm.
``When Republicans are desperate and they can't get back on message
_ because they don't have a message to begin with _ they try to
find a distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   The story line is familiar, but key antagonists in the 1986 race
are now allies in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Mark McKinnon was the media guru for Democratic Gov.
Mark White and Karl Rove was the chief strategist for GOP
challenger Bill Clements. As the gubernatorial campaign's only
debate drew near, word got out that a private eye hired by Rove
found an electronic transmitter hidden behind a red, white and blue
elephant needlepoint framed and hung behind Rove's desk.
</P>
<P>
   Aha, said Rove, who hired the private eye after becoming
convinced that campaign inside information was leaking out. The
White campaign denied any involvement and fired back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me the Republicans are the ones who have
experience at this kind of stuff,'' McKinnon said at the time,
referring to Watergate. ``If their goal is to distract the campaign
from the issues, they've done it fully. This thing stinks and the
wind is blowing from over there.''
</P>
<P>
   This time around, McKinnon is over there, and, as a former
Democratic strategist, he knows he is a natural suspect as
speculation grows about the purloined tape. But Bush campaign
officials say they have no reason to doubt the loyalty of the
trusted, top-level aides, such as McKinnon, who had access to the
tape.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon now speaks glowingly about Rove.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm, operating on nothing but surmise and her recollections
of 1986, believes McKinnon had it right the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has Karl Rove's fingerprints all over it,'' she said
Monday, convinced that top Bush aides were somehow involved in
making it look like the Gore camp was spying.
</P>
<P>
   So far, investigators have pointed no finger of blame. In 1986,
the FBI investigation played out to no conclusion. No charges were
ever filed and nobody ever figured out how the bug got behind the
elephant.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, during a Senate confirmation hearing when he was
nominated for the East Texas State University regents, Rove noted
that he never blamed the White campaign for the bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you'll recall, I specifically said at the time that we
disclosed the bugging that we did not know who did it, but we knew
who might benefit from it. And no, I do not know'' who planted the
bug, Rove testified. ``As to who bugged it, senator, I do not know,
and the FBI does not know.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 1986 race, Texas politics moved on, leading directly
to the current presidential race. Clements beat White. Four years
later, he did not seek re-election, clearing the way for Democrat
Ann Richards, with McKinnon as a top adviser, to beat Republican
Clayton Williams.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Bush ousted Richards. In 1998, Bush, with McKinnon as
his media adviser, won re-election in the race that set him up for
the current presidential bid with former adversaries Rove and
McKinnon as allies.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials acknowledge that McKinnon, because of
his Democratic past, quickly pops up as a suspect in the
clandestine tape shipment. But Bush aides, who insist the tape and
related documents were accessible only to trusted, top-level
staffers, do not suspect McKinnon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are absolutely confident it's not anyone within the Bush
organization,'' a Bush confidante said Monday. ``We've certainly
upgraded our security.''
</P>
<P>
   On the record, officials with both campaigns are complying with
FBI requests to keep quiet about details. Top Bush aides have been
interviewed by federal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, the Gore campaign suspended Michael Doyne, a
28-year-old junior staffer, who had made comments indicating he
knew of a ``mole'' in the Bush campaign office here. Doyne later
recanted the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Mark Fabiani said the Democratic
campaign found ``no evidence whatsoever that the campaign has
either received or used confidential information from the Bush
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Gore told reporters he did not know who sent the
stolen tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've read the reports that the FBI has identified a Bush
campaign official as the person responsible but I have no knowledge
other than that,'' said the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Rove on Monday was unavailable for comment. Since 1986, he has
consistently denied self-bugging his office for political gain in
that gubernatorial race.
</P>
<P>
   Some writers have tried to make something of the fact that Rove
likes to recommend the Sidney Lumet film ``Power,'' a tale of a
political consultant who helps get a less-than-qualified man
elected governor.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which includes a scene in which the political
consultant discovered his office was bugged, was released in 1986.

GRAHAME OUT 2-3 MONTHS WITH ANKLE FRACTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ This was supposed to be the year John Grahame got his
shot to play in the NHL for an entire season. Now that opportunity
is on indefinite hold. The Bruins' backup goalie is scheduled for
surgery this week to repair a broken ankle. He will be sidelined
2-3 months.
</P>
<P>
   Grahame, 25, hurt himself late Saturday, the team's first day
off since training camp began, when he tripped off a curb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard he was outside an establishment,'' said assistant
general manager Mike O'Connell. ``It was past 1 in the morning. I
don't really know the details. We'll see how it goes, but right now
he's not with us. He's got to get this operated on when the
swelling goes down.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was concerned about the circumstances surrounding
the injury, O'Connell said yes, ``But we'll wait until the facts
come in.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the amount of information about the injury was oddly
scarce as of Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It's the most recent blow to a team that hasn't had much going
right for it recently. Three of the Bruins' top five forwards are
out of the lineup because of contract disputes. The top goalie is
rehabilitating from two arthroscopies on his right knee. And of the
top three defensemen is on his way back from a knee arthroscopy.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Grahame puts added pressure on goalie Byron Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate for him at this point of the year,'' said
Dafoe during practice at suburban Wilmington. ``It definitely makes
me try to get this knee back as quick as possible now. There is a
little bit more of a sense of urgency in that I've got to be ready.
But I'm right on schedule, so it really doesn't affect me all that
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Andrew Raycroft is the only other goalie in camp, and the
20-year-old has done nothing to hurt his cause. But Dafoe is
expected to carry the load. Asked asked if he was ready to handle
that, Dafoe said, ``It's just a question of the knee and how it
feels back to back. It will be a good test this week because I
think I'm going to (play exhibition games) Thursday and Saturday,
which will be two games in three nights. And it's full games, so
we'll see where we're at.''
</P>
<P>
   The knee has come along very well, and although there is still
pain, Dafoe believes he'll only get better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got another week before the start of the season,'' said
Dafoe. ``It's almost where I want it to be and each day is a little
bit better. If I was completely healthy right now, this wouldn't
make me flinch. I love to play every game. There's nothing wrong
with that. It just puts a little pressure on because before, if it
wasn't quite ready, Johnny was there. Now, maybe it had better be
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Raycroft, who expected to be heading for Providence in
the next few days, he said he's keeping a level head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just taking it day by day,'' he said. ``(My confidence)
has grown a lot. Obviously the games have gone pretty well for me.
As long as I can keep progressing, I think every thing will go my
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe said he has faith in Raycroft.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was goalie of the year in the Canadian junior league, and
that's a pretty good resume to come up with,'' said Dafoe. ``He
hasn't looked out of place at all in the games that he's played.
It's not the end of the world here. We have to realize we still
have two good goaltenders here and we should be all right.''
</P>

   Update on the rest of the MASH unit: Forward Eric Nickulas
(charley horse) said he's improving steadily. ``I'm 100 times
better than I was,'' he said. ``I'm taking it day by day.'' Forward
Jay Henderson (concussion) said he tried riding the exercise bike
Sunday but had headaches so he remained off the ice Monday and was
scheduled to see a doctor. Center Andre Savage, who suffered a
dislocated left shoulder during Thursday's game against Detroit,
could need surgery. If that is the case, Savage would be sidelined
until Christmas. Forward Cameron Mann (stiff neck) is making
progress. ``Every day is a better day,'' said Mann. ``I'm coming
along slowly but surely.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Thirty-seven years ago, in the autumn of another political
season, Joseph Lieberman and a carload of other Yale students
headed south from New Haven, Conn., on a trip of nearly 1,300
miles, stopping only for gas and a quick dinner in the Washington
suburbs. They were eager to get to Mississippi, where they hoped to
make a little history.
</P>
<P>
   Recruited by William Sloane Coffin Jr., Yale's radical campus
chaplain, and Allard Lowenstein, the crusading student organizer
and future New York congressman, Lieberman was among 67 Yalies who
formed the first large group of Northern white students to travel
south for the cause of civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   It was dangerous work. Although Lieberman escaped harm, some of
the students were beaten, others were jailed, and almost all
endured petty harassment. They found dirt in their gas tanks, and
were ticketed by sheriffs for running nonexistent stop signs.
</P>
<P>
   The students canvassed the state, raising awareness about a mock
election that was intended to debunk the segregationist myth that
black Mississippians had no interest in voting. Like Lieberman,
most only stayed a week or two before returning to their classes.
But in that short time they demonstrated the vital role that white
students could play in what had been an almost exclusively black
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Lieberman and his Ivy League friends came the
attention of the Northern press and, to some extent, the protection
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Their efforts helped
inspire a much larger invasion of students in the summer of 1964 _
``Freedom Summer'' _ which in turn generated pressure for the
passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Until Lieberman, the Connecticut senator, became the Democratic
candidate for vice president, he did not talk much about this brief
but intriguing interlude of his youth. But Lieberman's civil rights
history, including his sojourn to Mississippi and his participation
in the March on Washington, captivated the Gore aides who
researched his life during the vice-presidential selection process.
And it has since been elevated by Lieberman and others into a
significant component of his political biography as the campaign
seeks to energize its base of black voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I hadn't talked about it for years and years and
years,'' Lieberman said in a telephone interview this week, ``but I
think it just struck people when I went through the vetting
process. They kind of carried it on, and then it was picked up by
others when I became a candidate to just say, you know, here's who
he is.''
</P>
<P>
   When Vice President Al Gore announced his vice-presidential
selection in Nashville on Aug. 8, he concluded by reading from a
column written by Lieberman in The Yale Daily News explaining why
he went to Mississippi. In Lieberman's own convention speech he of
how he ``walked with Martin Luther King in the March on Washington
for jobs and freedom'' and then ``went to Mississippi, where we
worked to register African-Americans to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Several black leaders said in interviews that Lieberman's
background made them more willing to forgive what they saw as his
apostasy on some issues. What he did as a 21-year-old, they said,
showed that he supported their cause with more than just political
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is given a lot of slack,'' said Julian Bond, the chairman
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
``The dangerous work he did in Mississippi is a sure sign that he
is a good person, willing to accept great risk to advance civil
rights for black Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, some of the same black leaders also question how
someone who marched with King and risked a trip to Mississippi
could have later questioned affirmative action and supported a
voucher experiment that black leaders broadly oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when Lieberman said in 1995 that he could no longer
defend policies that were ``based on group preference instead of
individual merit,'' Bond wrote a scathing rebuke for the op-ed page
of The Hartford Courant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps Senator. Joseph I. Lieberman has forgotten that trip
south three decades ago,'' wrote Bond, himself a civil rights
leader who now teaches the history of the movement. ``Perhaps he
believes 32 years is long enough to overcome a 300-year-old system
of inequality.''
</P>
<P>
   That critique stung, Lieberman said. ``It was the first time in
my life that I recall, certainly the first significant time,'' he
said, ``when people I respected, like Julian Bond but also just
generally the civil rights community, was on the other side from
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Since joining Gore's ticket, Lieberman has said he now supports
affirmative action and plays down the rather explicit opposition he
expressed in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also clear that in his public life as a state senator,
as state attorney general, and as a U &UR; . &LR; S &UR; . &LR;  senator, civil rights
matters have not taken precedence over moral issues, consumer
protection and foreign policy. Black leaders in Connecticut
consider him a friend, but say he rarely takes the lead on their
concerns. His ratings by civil rights groups have been good, but
inconsistent. His votes sided with the NAACP's positions 100
percent of the time in the current Congress but only 60 percent of
the time in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   As attorney general, Lieberman was credited with diversifying
his staff. When he began in 1983, one of the office's 119 lawyers
was black and 15 were women. When he left in 1989, 15 of 168
lawyers were minorities and 51 were women. Of his 58 Senate staff
members, 6 are African-Americans and 31 are women.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said in the interview that he had no desire to inflate
his role in the civil-rights movement. He recalled working in an
office in Jackson, drafting press releases and calling reporters.
On other days, he attended mass meetings at churches and handed out
brochures in black neighborhoods, encouraging people to vote in the
mock election for Aaron Henry and Edwin King, the designated
candidates for governor and lieutenant governor. Eventually, some
85,000 black Mississippians voted in ballot boxes placed in
churches, restaurants and barber shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to overstate what I did,'' Lieberman volunteered.
``I'm very proud that I went. It was a very important experience in
my life. But, you know, there were others who were there much
longer and did much more than I did.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman had grown up with black neighbors and friends in
Stamford, Conn., and had attended integrated schools. As an
observant Jew, he said, his parents and religious studies had
placed a heavy emphasis on respecting diversity.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1963, while working as an intern for the
Connecticut senator, Abraham A. Ribicoff, Lieberman joined the more
than 250,000 marchers in Washington who heard King deliver his ``I
Have a Dream'' speech. While it did not instantly strike him as one
of the defining speeches of the century, he said he knew that
``something extraordinary had happened.''
</P>
<P>
   At The Daily News, Lieberman wrote frequently and often movingly
in support of civil rights, declaring in one column that ``the
history of the Negro in America is a blatant contradiction to all
that this nation promises.'' In a column explaining his decision to
go to Mississippi, he wrote, ``There is much work to be done there
and few men are doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   But having been largely sheltered from racism and even
anti-Semitism as a child, Lieberman had little direct exposure to
segregation until he arrived in Mississippi. ``It was at once
stunning and infuriating to see it for real,'' he said. ``For the
first time in my life, I was uneasy, even fearful, in the white
community and comfortable and secure in the black community.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Having seen Mississippi change, Lieberman now says the trip
taught him profound lessons about the courage of the oppressed,
about the perils of caution and about democracy's capacity for
change. ``It was such a denial, a shocking denial,'' he said, ``not
only of the religious principles of equality that I'd been brought
up with but of the promises that America makes to its citizens.''

 &HT;    Equifax, Microsoft join forces to verify online buyers'
identities
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Equifax and Microsoft have combined forces to provide
a new level of protection in online shopping.
</P>
<P>
   The companies announced Monday that Equifax's PayNet Secure
technology will be used on Microsoft's Passport function with
Microsoft's e-commerce service to provide increased protection
against online identity fraud. Participating Internet retailers
will be able to verify the identity of customers almost instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Passport function provides a single name and
password that a consumer can use for verification when ordering
from a number of online retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Equifax, an information services company based in Atlanta,
already has credit-related information on millions of consumers.
Its PayNet product uses that database to verify the identity of an
Internet user, than assigns the user a unique password.
</P>
<P>
   The combination applies Equifax's security measures to
Microsoft's one-password convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Crutchfield, executive vice president for Equifax Internet
Solutions, said Equifax will receive a fee from the merchant each
time the PayNet technology is used. The fee will be 50 cents to
$1.50 for the first use by a consumer, and about 25 cents for each
subsequent use.
</P>
<P>
   He would not estimate how much revenue the service will generate
but noted the rapid growth of Internet retailing. ``We estimate
that by the year 2003, you're probably looking at 2.4 billion
retail transactions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate announcement Monday, Equifax said PayNet Secure
also will be used by Paymentech, a Dallas-based company that
processes online credit card charges. Paymentech handled 3 billion
transactions totaling $93 billion in sales during 1999, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
   The online consumer has limited contact with Equifax. The first
time the consumer charges an online purchase with a PayNet
customer, he or she would be hotlinked to Equifax.
</P>
<P>
   The Equifax computer would ask two to six questions based on
information already stored in Equifax's database. ``The questions
will be uniquely tailored to you, based on information that only
you and Equifax should know,'' Crutchfield said. ``If you have a
mortgage, it might ask, `Who is your mortgage with?' Or it may ask
about an auto loan, or gas credit cards or student loans.''
</P>
<P>
   The customer verifies his identity by answering the questions
correctly. Then the customer gets a password, which can be used for
verification with any participating merchant.

STOCKS SLIP IN ANTICIPATION OF LOWER TECHNOLOGY EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices slipped again Monday, pulled down by
continued worries about upcoming earnings reports from big
technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared during morning trading that the impact of Intel's
warning late Thursday about a shortfall in its third-quarter
revenue figures had entirely dissipated. The Nasdaq composite index
opened higher and remained in positive territory for a good part of
the session.
</P>
<P>
   But sellers began to lighten or eliminate positions in big-cap
technology names later on, reasoning that if Intel is having
problems, other companies must be having trouble too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Intel spoke to a secular issue, meaning demand,
and not a cyclical one, meaning currency, suggests that if they are
having a demand slowdown so are a bunch of the rest of the gang,''
said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co. in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like there is someone out there who is about to give
us bad news on the earnings front.''
</P>
<P>
   Pulled down by a further decline in Intel plus drops in
bellwether issues like Microsoft and Cisco Systems, the Nasdaq
composite index fell for a third consecutive session, dropping
62.54 points, or 1.6 percent, to 3,741.22.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.69
points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,439.03. And the Dow Jones industrial
average slipped 39.22 points, or 0.4 percent, to 10,808.15.
</P>
<P>
   Five stocks fell for every four that rose in price on the New
York Stock Exchange. Volume on the Big Board was 990 million
shares. Just under 2 billion shares changed hands on the Nasdaq
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Weakness in big technology stocks masked a good performance in
other sectors of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Financial service stocks did better, helped by a decline in
market interest rates and a further drop in spot oil prices. Shares
of biotechnology companies had a good day. And most big
pharmaceutical stocks were good performers.
</P>
<P>
   But large cap technology names got most of the attention.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which plunged 22 percent on Friday after it issued its
revenue warning, fell again Monday. The stock closed at $45.38,
down $2.56.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco was another big loser, dropping $3.13, to $57.19.
Hewlett-Packard dropped $6.19, to $98. And International Business
Machines closed at $121.63, down $2.25.
</P>
<P>
   Among Nasdaq stocks, Network Appliance was a big loser. It
closed at $130.44, down $16.94, after an analyst from Wit Soundview
said the company was likely to see revenue growth slow. Shares of
Network Appliance, which makes computers that store and deliver
files on networks, have more than tripled so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ciena, by contrast, was a big winner on the Nasdaq. The
fiber-optic equipment maker jumped $6.81, to $127.56, after it said
Korea Telecom had agreed to use Ciena systems for Internet and
data-network traffic in Seoul and other cities in the country.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, however, traders and analysts said it was
difficult to discern any sort of recognizable pattern in the price
action. And some said that is likely to be the rule rather than the
exception for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has a lot of things to be confused about, from the
election to energy prices to earnings,'' said Henry Herrmann, chief
investment officer at Waddell &AMP; Reed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is a lot of downside risk, because I think
earnings will be okay, but I think it will be hard to make a lot of
progress until we get some of these things sorted out.''

PIERCE LUCKY INJURIES WEREN'T WORSE, DOCTORS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Paul Pierce was doing well after doctors at New England
Medical Center sewed up knife wounds in his face, neck, and back _
including one that penetrated his abdomen and diaphragm and hit his
lung. Medical sources say he should recover enough to soon play
basketball for the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   They also say that is a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only inches difference between doing something
unbelievably bad versus something that is minor,'' said one person
close to the case about Pierce's knife wounds, adding that Pierce's
injuries fall in the latter category. While there still could be
complications, including infections stemming from his deep wounds
with a dirty knife, for now it appears the basketball star ``is all
patched back together.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce does have facial injuries, but they, too, are largely
superficial and unlikely to be permanent. ``He could have gotten
those sorts of things banging his head playing basketball,'' said
one person who saw the player after his attack. ``They are nowhere
near disfiguring.''
</P>
<P>
   Stabbings like Pierce's involving the upper extremities
typically set off so many alarms in hospitals that even before the
patient arrives a surgeon is standing by and an operating room is
ready. That's because there are so many vulnerable body parts
there, from the wind pipe and larynx to the carotid arteries that
carry blood to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are patients who have a high likelihood of something
with bad consequences being damaged and will likely need very rapid
assessment,'' explained Dr. Alasdair Conn, who runs the emergency
room at Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``A stab wound to the neck or chest,'' he added, ``can be life
threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   Several factors explain why Pierce's injuries were not more
damaging. He apparently was wearing a leather jacket, which slowed
down and partly cushioned the knife's impact. His assailant did not
rip through his spinal cord or any vital organs or vessels, and
those like the lungs that were injured were relatively easily
reinflated or repaired. The final critical factor cited by several
doctors is one medical science can not create but are highly
dependent on: luck.
</P>
<P>
   As a way of suggesting just how lucky Pierce is, one doctor
recalled the 1976 stabbing of Harvard football player Andrew
Puopolo during a fight in the Combat Zone. One wound was to his
lung, the other, which killed him, hit his heart.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the 1993 stabbing by a fan of top-ranked tennis
player Monica Seles that left her with an inch-deep slit between
her shoulder blades. But she came back to regain her tennis form
and winning ways.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce is not home free yet. He was listed in ``fair and stable
condition'' Monday night by officials at New England Medical
Center, where he was in the surgical intensive care unit surrounded
much of the day by his family. What they are watching for now,
doctors say, is to ensure that infection does not set in around his
wounds and to watch for underlying injuries that were not visible
on X-rays and other early tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If complications don't set in we think he'll be fine but we
can't say for sure for another week,'' said one source familiar
with the case. Others say it is a good sign that the Celtic checked
himself into the hospital and apparently never lost consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   As for the number of times he was stabbed, estimates range from
the police's ``more than five'' to other sources who say it was
anywhere from seven to 11. Part of the difficulty in telling is the
impossibility of knowing, when they are so close together, whether
a slash or penetration constitutes a separate stab or is a
continuation of another earlier wound.

 &HT;    Five things you should know about depression
 &HT;    Staff reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Years ago, few people admitted to clinical depression and fewer
still sought treatment. Those who have made their battles public,
as former Beers Construction Co. Chief Executive Officer Lawrence
Gellerstedt III did in an article in this newspaper this week, are
even rarereatment may be more intense, with psychotherapy and
antidepressants usually used together, sometimes with
hospitalization; electroconvulsive (shock) therapy may be used for
major depression that doesn't get better with therapy and
antidepressants alone. Treatment for depression has a success rate
of 85 percent.

   DEAD-LY SERIOUS: It may be groovy to download Internet music by
the Grateful Dead, but the group's lawyer doesn't have good vibes
about the practice. In advance of a federal court ruling on the
banning of the Napster Internet music-sharing site next Monday, the
band's attorney, Eric Doney, made it clear where his clients stand:
``If someone is going to make money, it should be them. The music
belongs to the creators, not someone else.'' For decades, the group
has encouraged Deadheads to record and trade audiotapes from the
group's 2,300 live concerts. Piracy was never much of a problem
until technology made it easy to swap digital recordings. Band
members haven't taken an official stance on the Napster
controversy, but last year they issued a digital policy declaring
that ``no commercial gain may be sought by Web sites offering
digital files of our music.'' Bummer.

researchers have determined that chemicals used on computer screens
can provoke allergies. A flame-retardant compound known as
trephenyl phosphate may cause itching, nasal congestion and
headaches, says a study published recently in Environmental Science
and Technology. Reactions may be caused when the video screen or
monitor heats up. The scientists found that more than half of the
18 computer brands tested contained significant levels of the
chemical. The cure: Sufferers should have plenty of ventilation

LAW TO PREVENT WASTE DUMPING BY CRUISE SHIPS MAY BE AMENDED 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress is close to passing legislation that the
Justice Department says would legalize cruise ships' dumping of
toxic chemicals from dry cleaning and photo processing on board,
offenses for which a major cruise-ship, Royal Caribbean, pleaded
guilty last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the provision's Senate sponsor, Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska),
said it would protect the environment by putting new limits on
where the ships can dump waste water in Alaska. His spokesman said
the provision was not meant to let ships put chemicals like dry
cleaning fluids into the waste water.
</P>
<P>
   An industry trade group said the legislation would give the
Coast Guard the authority to determine whether cruise ships are
living up to a voluntary agreement on when ``gray water'' _
untreated water from sinks, showers and washing machines _ can be
released.
</P>
<P>
   Pollution from cruise ships is becoming more troublesome as
their numbers grow, according to environmentalists. The General
Accounting Office said in February that cruise ship activity in
North American ports increased by almost 50 percent between 1993
and 1998. Some ships carry 5,000 people, and include light
industries and retail stores that produce hazardous wastes, like
print shops, dry cleaning shops and film processing shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are just giant seagoing hotels,'' said Robert C. Bundy,
the U.S. attorney for Alaska. He added that the new legislation
would make prosecutions difficult or impossible all over the United
States by contradicting older laws.
</P>
<P>
   Among other problems, according to Justice Department officials,
is a provision that would allow the release of gray water if
testing showed that it did not contain dry-cleaning and
photo-processing wastes in ``amounts that would constitute a
hazardous waste.'' But existing law bans any release of those
chemicals, and the proposed provision could be read to allow the
discharges as long as the chemicals ``were sufficiently diluted,''
according to the Justice Department. The department wants the
proposal modified to prohibit the release of the chemicals. The
Coast Guard is studying what position to take on the measure, which
is part of an authorization bill for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski's chief of staff, David K. Garman, said prosecutors
were misreading the provision. ``We're not trying to allow
something that's not currently allowed to happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor of Alaska, Tony Knowles, a Democrat, said in a
letter to Murkowski on Sept. 14 that the senator's legislation
``may cause more harm than good.''
</P>
<P>
   Allowing toxic chemicals to be released if diluted would be ``a
significant retreat from current law which treats the entire waste
stream as hazardous waste if any hazardous waste is mixed with
it,'' he wrote on Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Knowles also said that a new study of waste-water discharges by
large cruise ships, conducted by the state and the Coast Guard,
found that ``not a single sample of the sewage discharges fully
complied with existing state and federal standards.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is part of a Coast Guard authorization bill that
has passed the House and Senate in slightly different forms and is
expected to be the subject of a conference committee soon. The
Justice Department stated its objections in a letter to the House
Transportation Committee, Rep. Bud Schuster, R-Pa. But Shuster,
whose landlocked district does not see cruise ship traffic, will
leave the issue to his colleagues from Alaska, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists are unhappy that the law would shift
enforcement powers to the Coast Guard, which they see as more
sympathetic to the industry than the Environmental Protection
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has developed a voluntary code of ``waste
management practices and procedures,'' available on its Web site,
www.iccl.org/publicinfo/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, the second-largest cruise line,
pleaded guilty in July 1999, and agreed to an $18 million fine. Its
offenses included dumping hazardous chemicals into gray water, and
making false statements to the Coast Guard.

 &HT;    Embolization offers some women a way to avoid hysterectomy
 &HT;    By Gracie Bonds Staples
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a lot of ways, this day was no different than any
other Angela Brown had spent during long, hard stretches in the
pediatric specialty clinic at Hughes Spalding Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   She was tired, but as a registered nurse, wife and mother of
6-year-old twins, she couldn't give in to her body's signals. Not
the fatigue. Not the ice cravings. Not the heavy menstrual periods,
or pain, or frequent urination.
</P>
<P>
   But this June day in 1999 would become one of reckoning. There
could be no more denial. A fibroid tumor in her uterus was the size
of a 16-week pregnancy, literally draining her lifeblood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to see a patient when I became dizzy and short of
breath,'' Brown, 42, of Atlanta, recalled. ``It was so bad I didn't
trust myself to walk back alone, so I called my supervisor to come
get me.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors determined that Brown was anemic, her condition caused
by fibroids, a noncancerous tissue growth that is a source of
misery for legions of American women. Fibroids account for a third
of the up to 600,000 hysterectomies performed nationwide each year.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, hysterectomy was the most frequently recommended
treatment. But Brown instead chose the newest option: uterine
artery embolization, a treatment still considered experimental by
some doctors and insurers.
</P>
<P>
   As a former radiology nurse, Brown had only heard of fibroid
embolization, part of the growing field of interventional
radiology, but she knew a hysterectomy didn't figure in her future.
</P>
<P>
   She knew, for instance, that hysterectomy permanently removes
fibroids but does so at the price of a six- to eight-week recovery
period, the usual risks associated with major surgery and loss of
the uterus and fertility. But uterine embolization, which shrinks
fibroids by blocking their blood supply, would not only preserve
her uterus, but her recovery would be much quicker. Most patients
can be discharged within 24 hours and can return to their normal
activity level after one or two weeks. Pain from the procedure _
the most common postoperative complaint _ can be controlled with
medication.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who underwent the 90-minute procedure in April, called it
a ``cakewalk.''
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent to 40 percent of American women older than 35
have fibroids, benign growths that arise from the muscle tissue of
the uterus. For African-American women like Brown, it's closer to
50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the tumors are so small and inconsequential that women
are unaware of them. For many others, though, the growths can cause
abnormal menstrual flow, severe pain and heavy bleeding. Large
fibroids can even compress the ureter and cause frequent urination,
incontinence and painful sexual intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, women with fibroids had only two options besides
a hysterectomy: hormone therapy to decrease the amount of estrogen
so the tumors would stop growing; or myomectomy, major surgery that
removes the tumors while preserving the uterus _ a treatment that
may be closed to some women depending on the size, number and
location of their tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Fibroid embolization, available in France since the early 1990s
and at U.S. hospitals since 1996, is giving women another choice.
</P>
<P>
   Because long-term data comparing the procedure with other
treatments are not available, the American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists still considers it experimental and recommends it
be performed only as part of a clinical study.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, most of the data I've seen indicate this is a
viable treatment,'' said Dr. Mark Silverstein, an Emory University
interventional radiologist who specializes in fibroid embolization.
``Women tolerate the procedure well, and only about 10 percent need
additional therapy like hysterectomy because it didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   He has performed 13 fibroid embolizations at Emory in the past
two years and has scheduled about half a dozen more. Interventional
radiologists at Piedmont Hospital also perform the procedure, which
can cost up to $17,000, about the same as a hysterectomy. Patients
do not have to be enrolled in a clinical study to try it.
</P>
<P>
   As of 1998, the last year for which data are available, an
estimated 2,000 of the procedures had been performed nationwide,
according to the Society of Cardiovascular and Interventional
Radiology. About 950 of the society's members list themselves as
doing the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Scott Goodwin, the first radiologist in the United States to
perform uterine artery embolization for fibroids, said that at the
time he began doing the procedure, he did not feel it to be
experimental, based on a 20-year history of embolization for
obstetrical and gynecological hemorrhage and on work in France
specifically for fibroids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uterine artery embolization was started at UCLA outside of any
clinical trial and, in fact, most of these procedures since then
have been done outside of any clinical study,'' said Goodwin, chief
of vascular and interventional radiology at UCLA's Department of
Radiological Science.
</P>
<P>
   Reservations about the procedure center around the fact that no
one really knows the long-term effect, whether embolization
permanently corrects the problem or what the effects are on ovarian
function and fertility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people feel this shouldn't be the treatment for women who
desire fertility,'' Silverstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Rony Adam, director of the division of gynecology and
urogynecology at Emory University School of Medicine, isn't ready
to give the procedure his full support but says doctors should
offer uterine artery embolization as one of the choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do remain cautious about its long-term effect because
there's no data available,'' said Adam. ``I believe it's an
appropriate procedure in selected patients, but very careful
screening needs to be done and serious consideration given to all
the options, since those include more established procedures for
which we know the outcomes and results.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown swears by the procedure, saying she had all but forgotten
what it felt like to feel good. ``Before, I was so tired. I
couldn't go outside and play with my kids. At work, I felt guilty
because I didn't feel like I was doing my workload,'' she said. ``I
tolerated it so long it was normal. I didn't realize I could feel
so good again.''

 &HT;    George visits Rocker's hometown
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Rocker and the fallout from his politically incorrect
verbal outbursts are the subject of another magazine article, but
this time the tone is more sympathetic. George ($2.95) magazine
writer Pat Jordan talks to the Atlanta Braves pitcher's friends in
Macon about the real John Rocker. His pals are baffled by the
reaction to Rocker's comments. ``I mean he didn't choke his coach
or take drugs or beat up his girlfriend or be accused of murder,''
says his friend Jake Fincher. In Macon, he adds, ``John Rocker is
seen as an upstanding, Christian young man.'' Rocker apparently has
learned one lesson. When Jordan approached him about an interview,
he politely declined.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the magazine, George profiles Michael J. Fox as one
of its seven ``Citizens of the Year.'' Others include Missouri
journalist Frank Martin, whose weekly newspaper continually fights
bigotry and racism; Unita Blackwell, the first African-American
woman mayor in Mississippi; TV's good neighbor Fred Rogers; medical
missionary Glenn Geehoed; Kelly Stone, who operates a camp for
homeless kids and their moms; and public education crusader Lisa
Belzberg.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Entertaining dialogues: A couple of the best pieces in Talk
($3.50) are articles in which the subjects are allowed to, well,
talk. Actor Ben Affleck answers questions about his career after
``Good Will Hunting,'' his future films, the gay rumors and his
relationship with Gwyneth Paltrow. In a round-table discussion with
five successful women, author Erica Jong talks about feminism and
families. As Jong notes, a recent study indicated that 68 percent
of young single and married women would prefer not to work outside
the home.

   &QR;  The lad mags: Details ($3) has been relaunched after a brief
hiatus with a new look and a new focus. The magazine aimed at
25-35-year-old men has more fashions, more articles of substance
and no scantily clad female models. Robert Downey Jr. gives a
revealing interview about life after incarceration; Michael
Douglas' son Cameron talks about his life as a DJ in the shadow of
his famous father; and Jakob Dylan discusses his new album and the
burden of being Bob Dylan's son. ``It's just uncomfortable to be 22
and have 55-year-old guys screaming for songs that aren't yours,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the other magazines for young men are sticking to
their tried-and-true formulas. Maxim ($3.99) features a sexy cover
shot of Jessica Alba, one of the stars of Fox's new TV series
``Dark Angel.'' Other titillating articles include an interview
with Charlie Sheen about his sex life and his role on ``Spin
City''; a chat with Mets catcher Mike Piazza; and a male couch
potato's guide to the fall TV shows. Included are categories such
as Weepy Chick Fare (``Providence'') and Shows to Slit Your Wrists
To (``Bette'').
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Fiction focus: No, ``Rabbit'' Angstrom is not back, but John
Updike's famous character is very much evident in ``Nelson and
Annabelle.'' The first installment of Updike's two-part story about
the children of Angstrom appears in the fall books issue of The New
Yorker ($3). Nelson is the legitimate offspring of his father's
marriage while Annabelle is the result of an adulterous affair.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Caught Napstering: Shawn Fanning was only 18 a year ago when
he wrote a computer program that changed the musical world. Now
he's at the center of a court battle with musicians and the
recording industry. Time ($3.50) profiles the creator of Napster
and looks at what's next for the young programmer. Fanning called
his Internet application Napster because it was his high school
nickname for having ``nappy'' hair. But, as Time notes, even if
Napster is shut down (a hearing is set for Monday) , there are new
software programs such as Gnutella that allow files to be traded
from computer to computer without going through a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick reads: Atlanta ($3.95) offers its annual weekend guide
to autumn getaways along with a timely article about Alpharetta
horse farms that are in danger of vanishing in the wake of
residential development and urban sprawl. ... Newsweek ($3.50)
raises an alarming point with its cover story on the impending
teacher shortage. Half of all teachers will retire by 2010, and
many schools are scrambling to find good professionals for the
classroom.

PIERCE LUCKY INJURIES WEREN'T WORSE, DOCTORS SAY 
</HEADLINE>

 By LARRY TYE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Paul Pierce was doing well after doctors at New England
Medical Center sewed up knife wounds in his face, neck, and back _
including one that penetrated his abdomen and diaphragm and hit his
lung. Medical sources say he should recover enough to soon play
basketball for the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   They also say that is a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only inches difference between doing something
unbelievably bad versus something that is minor,'' said one person
close to the case about Pierce's knife wounds, adding that Pierce's
injuries fall in the latter category. While there still could be
complications, including infections stemming from his deep wounds
with a dirty knife, for now it appears the basketball star ``is all
patched back together.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce does have facial injuries, but they, too, are largely
superficial and unlikely to be permanent. ``He could have gotten
those sorts of things banging his head playing basketball,'' said
one person who saw the player after his attack. ``They are nowhere
near disfiguring.''
</P>
<P>
   Stabbings like Pierce's involving the upper extremities
typically set off so many alarms in hospitals that even before the
patient arrives a surgeon is standing by and an operating room is
ready. That's because there are so many vulnerable body parts
there, from the wind pipe and larynx to the carotid arteries that
carry blood to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are patients who have a high likelihood of something
with bad consequences being damaged and will likely need very rapid
assessment,'' explained Dr. Alasdair Conn, who runs the emergency
room at Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``A stab wound to the neck or chest,'' he added, ``can be life
threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   Several factors explain why Pierce's injuries were not more
damaging. He apparently was wearing a leather jacket, which slowed
down and partly cushioned the knife's impact. His assailant did not
rip through his spinal cord or any vital organs or vessels, and
those like the lungs that were injured were relatively easily
reinflated or repaired. The final critical factor cited by several
doctors is one medical science can not create but are highly
dependent on: luck.
</P>
<P>
   As a way of suggesting just how lucky Pierce is, one doctor
recalled the 1976 stabbing of Harvard football player Andrew
Puopolo during a fight in the Combat Zone. One wound was to his
lung, the other, which killed him, hit his heart.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the 1993 stabbing by a fan of top-ranked tennis
player Monica Seles that left her with an inch-deep slit between
her shoulder blades. But she came back to regain her tennis form
and winning ways.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce is not home free yet. He was listed in ``fair and stable
condition'' Monday night by officials at New England Medical
Center, where he was in the surgical intensive care unit surrounded
much of the day by his family. What they are watching for now,
doctors say, is to ensure that infection does not set in around his
wounds and to watch for underlying injuries that were not visible
on X-rays and other early tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If complications don't set in we think he'll be fine but we
can't say for sure for another week,'' said one source familiar
with the case. Others say it is a good sign that the Celtic checked
himself into the hospital and apparently never lost consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   As for the number of times he was stabbed, estimates range from
the police's ``more than five'' to other sources who say it was
anywhere from seven to 11. Part of the difficulty in telling is the
impossibility of knowing, when they are so close together, whether
a slash or penetration constitutes a separate stab or is a
continuation of another earlier wound.

 &HT;    Wachovia president, COO to take an early retirement
 &HT;    By Christine Van Dusen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wachovia's president and chief operating officer, G. Joseph
Prendergast, will retire in January after almost 28 years with the
financial holding company. He is 55.
</P>
<P>
   Wachovia _ based in Atlanta and Winston-Salem, N.C. _ does not
plan to name a successor at this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like my best friend is leaving,'' L.M. Baker Jr., the
58-year-old chairman and chief executive officer, said Monday.
``But one of the things that happens is that people come and go and
the organization continues to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Prendergast earned a base salary of $616,667 and a bonus of
$770,800 in 1999, up from a salary of $540,000 and a bonus of
$573,800 in 1998. Because he is retiring at age 55, he will receive
reduced retirement benefits. Company officials declined to say just
how much he will lose.
</P>
<P>
   According to Prendergast, the package is still ``pretty
attractive'' and the reduction is not significant enough to deter
him from retiring.
</P>
<P>
   When Prendergast leaves, two other executives will take on his
duties. Jean E. Davis, chief technology and operations officer,
will oversee retail financial services and electronic business.
Davis, 44, has worked at Wachovia for 15 years in a number of
positions, including human resources director.
</P>
<P>
   Stanhope A. Kelly, head of the banking division, will oversee
the asset and wealth management line of business and direct
Wachovia's branches. He joined Wachovia in 1980 and has served as
head of the consumer financial services division.
</P>
<P>
   Prendergast's departure doesn't put a wrinkle in Wachovia's
succession plans, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been clear to me that Joe could run Wachovia,'' he
said. ``If something had happened to me, the directors would have
agreed. But now we can look in other directions. That's the way it
works.''
</P>
<P>
   Prendergast joined the company in 1973. In April 1999, he
assumed the roles of president and chief operating officer. One of
his recent duties was to spearhead the company's restructuring
project. Wachovia _ whose stock price has fallen almost 25 percent
on the year _ announced in August that it would cut about 1,800
positions in an effort to lift pretax earnings by $425 million by
2002. Wachovia closed Monday at $55.25, up 6 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Prendergast believes he has seen the restructuring project
through and can now ``come up for air,'' he said. He plans to spend
more time with his wife, who is retired, and his 30-year-old son,
his parents and his four siblings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody retires for good,'' he said. ``Anything
I do in the future would have a decidedly different shape.''

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ In the 13 years since she graduated, Cheryl
Jenkins Haywood has viewed calls from Harvard Law School as an
intrusion. When the school asked for her help in recruiting others
like her _ young, talented, and black _ she refused.
</P>
<P>
   As she puts it, ``I didn't want to tell them how much I hated
it.''
</P>
<P>
   For many black alumni, being at Harvard Law School meant feeling
like stepchildren or guinea pigs in an experiment where neither the
school nor the students felt confident of the result.
</P>
<P>
   But last weekend, as school officials stood before them and
declared, ``This is  &UR; your  &LR; school,'' many black alumni said they
felt for the first time that maybe it is.
</P>
<P>
   About 600 had returned to campus _ a number of them for the
first time in 20 or 30 years _ to celebrate the law school's first
black alumni weekend. Across the country, colleges and universities
are adding similar black-oriented events to their roster of fall
homecomings.
</P>
<P>
   At Holy Cross in Massachusetts, Kenyon College in Ohio and
Colorado College, alumni who left campus profoundly ambivalent are
being welcomed back for the first time with features like Sunday
gospel brunches and black bands; Harvard played host to the Ohio
Players at a Friday night dinner, while at Macalester College in
Minnesota, the main event was a show by the Sounds of Blackness.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the reunions are partly an exercise in public
relations. Schools have for years lamented that black alumni do not
attend regular reunions or donate much money. In the late 1980s,
Harvard Law endured bitter demonstrations by students protesting a
lag in the hiring of black professors.
</P>
<P>
   But the schools and the alumni say the timing of last weekend's
event has much to do with the waning of affirmative action, which
has come under legal and political attack in the past five years.
Universities have been looking for ways beyond racial and ethnic
preferences to attract top black candidates and have decided that
one way to do so is to mend relations with their black graduates,
who go into the world as potential ambassadors of their alma
maters.
</P>
<P>
   An argument that institutions under attack make in favor of
continuing affirmative action is that it has worked _ it has
created the core of the country's black professional class.
</P>
<P>
   For the alumni _ here at Harvard Law, Pulitzer Prize-winning
fiction writers and filmmakers as well as judges and congressmen _
the reunions offer a chance to demonstrate that they have made good
use of the opportunities they were given, for their own sakes and
for the sake of the larger debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will send a clarion call,'' said Eric V. Moye, a trial
lawyer and former state district judge in Texas who graduated from
Harvard Law in 1979. ``You name a walk of life and one of our
brethren is at the vanguard. That says to the whole country, `The
whole notion of black inferiority is bull.' It says to the schools,
`If you work hard to find people and you give them a chance, they
will not only succeed, they will flourish. It doesn't diminish the
quality of your institution, it doesn't diminish the quality of
your student body. In fact, it enriches both.'''
</P>
<P>
   To some blacks, though, the race-specific attention is a kind of
resegregation, and officials at some schools question how far to
tailor the events. At some schools, gay alumni are pressing for a
reunion of their own. Williams College, among others, renamed its
reunion for ``Alumni of Color'' to reflect pressure from Hispanic-
and Asian-Americans for their own reunions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When was the last time the Jewish alumni had a reunion? It's
ridiculous,'' said William T. Coleman, a former secretary of
transportation who was honored at Harvard this weekend for his work
on the team that argued the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education school
desegregation case before the Supreme Court. When Coleman graduated
from the law school in 1946, he could not find a job as a lawyer in
Philadelphia. But now, he said, ``There's much more opportunity
than there's ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, say the point is not segregation, but
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our presence has not always been taken for granted at Harvard,
and our gathering is a real symbol for progress at Harvard and for
society at large,'' said Stephanie K. Bell-Rose, head of the
Goldman Sachs Foundation and a 1984 graduate. ``Reflecting on that
progress at different stages is important.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, the institutions could not have done this much earlier
because, as Harvard President Neil L. Rudenstine told the alumni
Saturday, ``Fifteen or 20 years ago, there were not enough people
to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, many here last weekend said they would not have
attended any events. Almost all expressed deep appreciation for the
opportunity to earn degrees from one of the nation's foremost law
schools. But they also recall the difficulty of being in what was
for many years a tiny minority, feeling as though other students,
and even the school, regarded them as there by dint of race, not
merit.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1965, there was only one black student in Harvard
Law's graduating class. Reginald E. Gilliam Jr., who arrived in
Cambridge that year, spoke of professors who seemed to have ``black
days,'' when they would only call on students of one race.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the white kids would sit back and close their books;
it was like entertainment day,'' Gilliam, now a Washington
lobbyist, said. ```We'll get the handful of blacks, then we'll go
about our real business,' that was the attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Some suspicion toward the institutions is tempered by age.
Still, what brings those who remain bitter back is the sense that
there are now administrators and faculty at the schools who look
like them. At Smith College, a group of black alumni who came back
in the spring of 1999 said they were inspired to attend by Ruth J.
Simmons, the college's first black president. At Harvard Law, many
said they came back because David Wilkins, a graduate and professor
here who is black, was behind the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is, for me, a coming to terms with it,'' said Deborah C.
Wright, class of 1984, now head of Carver Bancorp, Inc, the
nation's largest black-operated bank. ``It's important to make a
statement to the school that we're out there, this can be a
positive resource if you're willing to listen to the reality of how
we felt and figure out how to use us.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Walking for the first time into the enormous white tent set up
behind the law school for the weekend, many alumni looked taken
aback at the elaborate flowers and buffet tables _ on Sunday
morning, laden with collard greens, fried chicken and grits _ and
by the sheer number of black faces.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard devoted part of the weekend to review the past,
including a lesson in the history of blacks at Harvard, which
included the fact that the school was endowed by money that the
founder, John Harvard, earned from selling his slaves in the cane
fields of Antigua.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Bell, the law school's first black professor, who quit
to protest the lack of tenured black women on the faculty, returned
to a hero's ovation, the same reception that greeted Lani Guinier,
the first black woman professor, who was hired in 1998. Rudenstine
defended the need for diversity on campus so ardently in a speech
Saturday morning that one black professor jokingly referred to him
as ``Reverend Rudenstine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have brought to Harvard means every bit, if not more,
than what you take away,'' Rudenstine told the alumni. ``We, as an
institution, need you.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end, some who arrived reluctant left grateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone keeps saying this is the best time they ever had at
Harvard,'' said Jenkins Haywood, who until recently was a clerk in
Brooklyn's drug-treatment court. Now, she said, she would welcome
the calls from Harvard, even help recruit. ``To be here in true
numbers, it makes us feel like we really were here.''

NIGERIAN HURDLER'S TEAMMATES SUPPORT HER IN HER SORROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM CAPLE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The day before hurdler Gloria Alozie was to
arrive at the Olympics, the Nigerian coach called her teammates
together. I know you are sad, he said. I know you hurt. But for
Gloria's sake, you must stop crying. You must not show her your
tears.
</P>
<P>
   The Nigerian team did its best. Alozie's teammates welcomed her,
they comforted her, they supported her.
</P>
<P>
   But with all their words, all their hugs, what really could they
say, what could they do to remove her pain, her sadness? Too
little.
</P>
<P>
   And so when Alozie went to bed in the athletes' village that
first night, her teammates, her friends, could hear the Nigerian
hurdler crying. Crying over the death of Nigerian sprinter Hyginus
Anugo. Crying over the death of a teammate. Crying for the man
Alozie was to marry after the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Alozie and Anugo grew up together in the small village of
Amator. They played together, ran together. Attended church. Became
friends. Fell in love.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been together,'' Alozie said. ``Training
together, competing together. Many competitions together. But I
don't like to remember for long.''
</P>
<P>
   The two had hoped to compete in the Olympics together but Anugo
just failed to earn a spot on Nigeria's relay team. He came here
anyway to be with his fiance, to cheer her when she ran the 100
hurdles, to support her during her attempt to become the first
Nigerian to win a gold medal in track.
</P>
<P>
   He will not do so. A week before the Olympics began, Anugo was
hit by a car and killed while crossing a Sydney street on an
errand. He was 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very shy, a very nice guy,'' Nigerian hurdler Angela
Atede said. ``He was a good Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   Alozie was in Japan training at the time of the accident and
didn't arrive here until days later. When she did, she wanted to
return home right away before the Olympics began, to get away from
the land where her beloved died. Her teammates talked her into
staying, convinced her to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is gone is gone,'' fellow hurdler Angela Atede said.
``The only thing to do was to stay and compete. Stay and win the
gold medal for him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to bring the body back right away but Gloria said
that if they took him, she would go with him. And it is so far back
to Nigeria that she would not be able to come back in time. So they
are waiting to send the body back after the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked years to be here and I still wanted to compete,''
Alozie said. ``Since he is no longer here, I still like to
compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Alozie is 22, a small woman, just 5-foot-1. Her middle name is
Oluchi, which means ``Work of God.'' A devout Christian, she spoke
little of Anugo Monday when talking to reprorters for the first
time _ the memory is too painful _ and much about her faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``When everything happened, it was difficult,'' she said. ``But
God comforted me. He encouraged me and takes care of me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to remember things (about the death). My answer
is God has taken care of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Because she is competing in the Olympics, Alozie is allowed no
tranquilizers or other drugs that might help her in her grief. The
Nigerian team provided her with a counselor and her teammates
helped as best they could.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first night, I heard her crying in her room and knocked
on the door and talked to her,'' Atede said. ``Everyone heard her
and talked to her that night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been very kind,'' Alozie said. ``Everyone is so nice
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Alozie will run in the 100 hurdles final Wednesday and is
favored to win a medal (her best time is second only to Olympic
champion Gail Devers). Atede will not run, though. After Alozie ran
in the first heat, she ran in the second, then watch the third and
final heat on the television monitor. After the final heat, Atede
saw that her time was not fast enough to advance to the final. She
dropped her head into her hands and began to cry.
</P>
<P>
   And when she did, Alozie sat down next to her and held her
teammate. Supporting her, comforting her.

MORE SHOCK FOR A TEAM WITH A HISTORY OF TRAGEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The feeling is always the same. Experience doesn't
soften the blow or cushion the shock. The reaction to news that a
young man, a world-class athlete, is near death can be as much
physical as it is emotional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had that same emotion all over again,'' Jan Volk said Monday
after learning that Celtics forward Paul Pierce was fighting for
his life after being stabbed in a Boston nightclub. ``You get that
lump in your throat, that pang in your stomach. I know exactly what
it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than three years since Volk was replaced as
general manager of the Celtics. In almost three decades with the
team, he witnessed many great moments, including five world
championships, as well two tragedies from which the franchise is
still reeling. Thoughts of the death of Lenny Bias in 1986 and the
fatal collapse seven years later of Reggie Lewis came rushing back
when he heard the news about Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just a flood of repressed memories when you hear about
this, and you realize it never disappears,'' said Volk. ``It can be
shunted aside, but it will always be there, below the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Auerbach felt the same way. He got an early morning call at
his Washington, D.C., home informing him of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary, it really is,'' Auerbach said. ``You do think
about all the other stuff. But the main thing now is that the kid
is going to be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, of course, the most important difference. Officials at
Boston Medical Center reported that Pierce was in fair and stable
condition after surgery to repair the damage caused by the knife
attack. The Celtics said their star swingman was alert and in good
spirits.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few days, we will learn more about the events at the
club that left Pierce with more than five stab wounds. He will
continue to recover in his hospital room and his family said he is
looking forward to ``putting this ordeal behind him.'' Yes, Rick
Pitino might have a gaping hole in his lineup. But he will trade
that any day for not having to attend a funeral or having to
comfort a grieving parent.
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach and Volk didn't have that luxury with Bias or Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, fresh off their 16th (and still last) NBA title, the
Celtics had the second pick in the draft and took the sleek, strong
Bias, a star at the University of Maryland. Auerbach had closely
followed Bias's college career and had even counseled the star to
stay in college for the full four years. Larry Bird, then in his
prime, was so enthused by the selection that he said he'd come to
rookie camp, a rarity for a veteran star. Bird said he was looking
forward to playing against Bias in practice and with him during
games. He never got the chance. Bias died a few days after the
draft from a cocaine overdose.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Lewis collapsed during a playoff game in Boston Garden
and was taken to the hospital. Two months later, he collapsed and
died while shooting baskets at Brandeis University. Lewis was the
captain of the Celtics and had been an NBA All-Star. Questions
continue to surround Lewis's death more than seven years after the
fact. The doctor who diagnosed Lewis's heart problem as a benign
fainting condition was cleared in a malpractice lawsuit. However,
Lewis's widow last week sought to reopen her right to appeal the
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   For some scary moments Monday, there was genuine concern that
Pierce might be another Celtic casualty. He suffered stab wounds to
the face, neck, and back. It remains to be seen what happened, why
it happened, and why Pierce _ and no one else _ was stabbed.
</P>
<P>
   But he's going to make it and he is, by all accounts, a most
fortunate individual. Barring further complications, he will be
able to play for the Celtics again.
</P>
<P>
   And that awful feeling that hit home Monday to the Celtics'
executives, while never fully going away, at least had a different
ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``For anyone who has gone through it, you can never be fully
desensitized,'' Volk said. ``I know how (the Celtics) feel. It's a
terrible, terrible feeling. Thankfully, this appears as if it will
have a better result for everybody.''

 &HT;    Freeman a beacon of hope for many
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - Angela Bates stood behind her mother's chair. Their
hands clasped as Cathy Freeman, heroine to them and all
dark-skinned, indigenous people of Australia, stepped into the
blocks on the 19-inch television screen.
</P>
<P>
   Maraea Bates, 51, does not discuss her own experience as a
target of racial discrimination. ``Just struggles everyday,'' she
said wearily. ``You have to learn to live with it. Try not to let
it get you down.''
</P>
<P>
   Angela, bold and 22, is not so compromising. As a schoolgirl,
classmates fired off the same sort of slurs often aimed at blacks
in America _ and then some. ``They told us to get back in our
canoes and go back to our countries,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The unspeakable persecution of the indigenous is comparable to
that of Native Americans, but far more recent. As a result, the
wounds have not scabbed over.
</P>
<P>
   So, with the aborigine Cathy Freeman crouched over to start the
400-meter finals Monday, a roomful of worshipers wanted to reach
into the TV and push her forward. To help her show their white
countrymen that they, too, can excel. Angela's sister Chantal, 19,
said teachers treated her as if she were too dumb to learn. ``It
just really crushed me emotionally,'' she recalled. ``I was
confused. I always thought we were all one people.''
</P>
<P>
   Her friend Louise Togo, 24, remembers coming home from school 10
years ago in tears daily for three weeks, the nasty names burning
in her ears, the tugs on her hair causing hurt. Enough, her father
told her.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, a boy yanked her hair and called her a ``burnt
sausage.'' In a rage, she pushed the edge of a desk up against his
throat. Then she ignored the teacher's plea to desist and was
ejected from class.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' she said. ``My parents never punished me for
doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday they had gathered to watch Freeman at Koori Radio, a
community station for the indigenous with matching mottos: ``Black
Is Back'' and ``Putting The Soul Back in Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   Station volunteer Phil Ahwang, a pal of Freeman's who grew up on
the same street, said her motivation goes beyond personal glory.
``Running is a way for her to tell a wider community, 'Let's be
friends,' `` he said. ``The more she ran for the people, the easier
it became for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Next to him on the couch, Tjarani Barton-Vaofanilla, 4, chanted
``Go, Cathy.'' With a second youngster, they held out the red,
black and gold aborigine flag.
</P>
<P>
   As the runners raised in the blocks, the room was shushed
silent. In a flash, it was filled with screams, shouts and stomping
feet. It grew louder as Freeman trailed entering the straightaway,
and louder still as she drew away to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at her shoes,'' exulted program director Grant Saunders.
They were the colors of the flag.
</P>
<P>
   As if Freeman could hear, they implored her to carry the
Aborigine flag on her victory lap. Freeman was roundly criticized
when she did so at the Commonwealth Games. On cue, the TV showed
Freeman clutching the flag of her country and of her heritage.
</P>
<P>
   More bedlam. More admiration than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom always told me to stand up for my rights,'' Chantal
Bates said. Now she had a role model to show what can be
accomplished when you stand tall and firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cathy has made me proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Louise Togo, ``It's amazing what she overcame. She instills
pride in us to achieve our goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The race over, Maraea Bates still clutched her older daughter's
hands. ``I'm so overwhelmed,'' she said, pulling one hand free to
wipe away a tear.

 &HT;    What's another 440 feet after 10,000 miles? A lot
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - I haven't gotten a good night's sleep since my editor
assigned me to climb up Harbor Bridge -- 440 feet above sea level
-- and write about my experience.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not terrified of heights, but I am mildly scared of them. I
don't do ladders over 10 feet. I can ride roller coasters for
7-year-olds. But when my son graduated from American Adventures to
Six Flags, he was on his own.
</P>
<P>
   So for five nights I dreaded this assignment. But since they
sent me 10,000 miles to cover the Olympics, what's another 440
feet?
</P>
<P>
   On Monday at dusk it was time to take the one-hour train ride
from Olympic Park to the harbor area to meet my fate.
</P>
<P>
   Several people told it me the three-hour climb was nothing. But
one person's nothing is another person's something.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, more than 340,000 people have climbed the bridge in the
nearly two years this tourist attraction has been open.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's perfectly safe. You wear a harness and are tethered
to a static line.
</P>
<P>
   And sure, I would have an unbelievable panoramic view of the
city. That is, of course, if I decided to look up from the steel
stairs that would carry me to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arrival at BridgeClimb Sydney, I received a little
reassurance. Chelsea Clinton's picture testified to the fact that
she had climbed the bridge just three days ago. Surely, the Secret
Service wouldn't let the First Daughter do something stupid.
</P>
<P>
   But when the BridgeClimb staff started to drag out the
equipment, I became anxious again. First the breathalyser test. No
drunks allowed. Then the liability release forms. No plaintiffs
allowed. Then the jumpsuit, handkerchief that attached to your
wrist, hat, flashlight, gloves, harness and safety cable.
</P>
<P>
   I felt like an astronaut and I didn't like the feeling.
</P>
<P>
   After a short walk from the company's headquarters, my group of
eight plus three guides were at the base of the bridge. I could
hear the roar of trains and cars cruising above.
</P>
<P>
   I took a deep breath, got hooked to the static line and started
praying as we began walking up the stairs with my fingers firmly
clutching both handrails. I was glad I was tethered on the left
side of the handrail, because the most visible part of the water
was off to the right.
</P>
<P>
   As we began to climb, I kept looking at the stairs and the bolts
around them, too afraid to peek at the water or the Opera House
nearby. I honestly thought about bailing out at this time. But I
convinced myself I would get fired, which would not go over well
with my wife, especially after spending three weeks away from home.
</P>
<P>
   So I pressed on. Even though the incline was very gradual, the
wind was blowing and I was getting more frightened as the height
started to noticeably increase.
</P>
<P>
   I still kept my head down as I walked. After going about
two-thirds of the way up the bridge, I started to take little peeks
at the scenery. I wouldn't look straight down at the water. I would
just try to look horizontally off into the distance at the Opera
House, tall buildings or the boats.
</P>
<P>
   One of the guides pointed out the Olympic flame 10 miles to the
left. But I was too scared to look in that direction, because I
would have to turn around and look downward. I wasn't ready for
that.
</P>
<P>
   My little peeks, however, started to increase my confidence
level. So did the frequent stops for members of the group to take
pictures. The longer I stayed in one spot, the more secure I began
to feel. Then I could take more frequent looks at the scenery
without having to stare at the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, the view of the harbor was breathtaking. The sun was
setting and the city's lights were starting to take up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   My trepidation would wax and wane as we continued up the final
leg of the climb to the top. A key moment came when I spotted the
Australian flag at the top of the bridge. I literally began singing
``God Bless Australia'' to myself.
</P>
<P>
   But I didn't realize that the worst wasn't over yet.
</P>
<P>
   After reaching the top, we had to walk across a catwalk from one
side of the bridge to the other. I couldn't avoid seeing the cars
and water below.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to take a picture on the catwalk, but couldn't muster up
the nerve. It was the only spot where standing and waiting for
others to take their photographs produced more anxiety, not less.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, feelings of relief started to take over as I crossed to
the other side of the bridge and headed down. As we descended, I
grew more comfortable and was able to take much longer looks at the
scenery. I saw the Olympic flame and got a rush of adrenalin. After
all, I'm on the Harbor Bridge overlooking one of the most beautiful
cities in the world, covering the Olympics. What's to worry about?
</P>
<P>
   To be honest, it appeared that I was more scared than any of the
other members of the group. Of course, you never really know what's
going on inside someone else.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not afraid of heights and are ever in Sydney, I would
certainly recommend the climb. It costs between $63 and $80 in U.S.
money, depending on when you go.
</P>
<P>
   It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience. And, for me, the operative
word is once.

 &HT;    Lackluster pin trading has collectors surprised
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - Pin trading is taking a beating at the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The collecting frenzy seized Atlanta four years ago and
intensified in Nagano. But the wind has gone out of its sails in
Sydney, where people browse the pin tables but are hesitant to
trade and loathe to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people just don't take to the collecting,'' said Don
Bigsby, president of the Olympin Collector's Club in Schenectady,
N.Y. ``You ride the trains, the buses, you go to events, you don't
see people trading pins like you always did before.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta collectors who made the trip Down Under have been
surprised by the lackluster response.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible ... very, very slow,'' said Jody Sanders of
Atlanta Sports Collectibles, who anticipates losing money on the
venture. ``A few people are getting interested. They say, `What is
this about pin collecting?' And you try to explain it, but when you
say $10, they just kind of nod and walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   That's $10 in Australian currency, about $5.60 in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   But just because people aren't trading doesn't mean they don't
have pins.
</P>
<P>
   In the past four days, 450,000 official pins have been sold in
stores. That brings the total since 1997 to an astonishing 8
million pins. According to SOCOG, shoppers have bought an average
of six pins per transaction _ the cheapest costing $10 (Australian)
_ and organizers hope to sell 20 million by the end of the year.
There are more than 3,000 different designs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it appears buyers would rather keep the pins they like as
souvenirs than trade them away.
</P>
<P>
   Bigsby now believes that the Japanese people's fanatical
behavior in 1998 was an aberration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stores didn't have any pins,'' he said. ``I think the
people had a lot more spending money in Japan and I also think that
a lot of the Japanese were buying pins, not for the pins, but for
the cultural experience or exchange. They thought we were sort of
unique and strange, and this was a way to make contact with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Pin dealers thought the Aussies would be just as excited,
especially since pre-Olympic pin shows in Sydney were extremely
popular. Now, after sneaking through customs with pounds of pins,
some dealers are afraid they're going to be stuck with them.
</P>
<P>
   The Sanderses have three locations. Jody Sanders has a table at
the Coca-Cola pin trading center, which is conveniently located in
Darling Harbor. Her husband, Barry, has set up at an official pin
site in Paramatta, a working-class suburb, and their son Darren is
at a park near Sydney's Central Station. Vince Swain of Atlanta
began trading pins in 1996, and he wants to pass his love of the
hobby along to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has a good attitude,'' he said. ``They're just
learning about pins. Everybody's amazed it's such a big deal. Until
it comes to your town, you don't understand it. If you give
somebody a pin, they're kind of shocked. If they don't have pins to
trade, I say, `Here's your first one.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so generous. The sharks in Australia aren't just
in the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no pin trading; there is pin stealing and pin
giving,'' said Mary Jo Gettmann of Friday Harbor, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular pins from outside Australia are the ``NOCs,''
which stands for national Olympic committees. In other words,
country pins.
</P>
<P>
   Congo, Madagascar and new Olympic entries, East Timor and Palau,
have been among the hardest to acquire.

 &HT;    Athletes score big in party district
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - Olympic athletes may say they have a glamorous life.
But don't believe a word of it. By 10 p.m. Monday, most of Sydney's
Olympians had eaten a healthy supper, called their parents and
retired to bed, where they fell into blissful slumber and dreamed
of the medals they would win the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Monday was a repeat performance of what has become a
nightly ritual of these Olympic Games. Thousands of athletes turned
the clubs and bars of Darling Harbor into a pleasure zone of
drinking, dancing and carousing.
</P>
<P>
   By 10, most of them probably hadn't even decided on an outfit.
There had been other things to attend to, like watching Cathy
Freeman and Michael Johnson take their gold medals. But by 3 a.m.,
The Last Lap, the exclusive athletes' only club on Cockle Bay, had
turned into a Tower of Babel.
</P>
<P>
   Sex was in the air. And suds. And Susie O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   While a rock 'n' roll band thrashed and a hanging caldron flamed
above the dance floor, the Aussie gold medal swimmer was hoisted
into the air for a body surf. For a few moments, she was Madame
Butterfly again. It was the same treatment that swimmer Pieter van
den Hoogenband got over the weekend at Heineken House, the Dutch
party enclave across the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best vibe, like everything around you is unreal,''
said James Irving, an 18-year-old University of Sydney student, who
was swigging rum and Coke with his ``uni'' buddies.
</P>
<P>
   Not that these guys had any hope of getting into The Last Lap.
They were hanging out at the Moose Lodge (usually known as
Pontoon), a bar just down the sidewalk, which has become the
favored watering hole of Canadian athletes and fans.
</P>
<P>
   Outside The Last Lap, a security officer was telling a group of
policemen to brace themselves for another big night. ``Now that
word has gotten out that the athletes are here, as the venues start
to empty out tonight, we are expecting it to be a mad house, just
like Saturday night,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In order to get into the club, you have to have be an athlete or
an invited guest. Even athletes pay a $20 cover. But some fans were
willing to give a bouncer up to $50 to give them one of the yellow
arm bracelets that would let them in. ``This is very
Hollywoodish,'' said one observer, as rubber-neckers staked out
their territory on the sidewalk and an adjacent set of stairs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Moose Lodge, where anybody could pay $5 and get in, there
was a long queue by 10 p.m. At 3 a.m., people still were waiting in
line. ``I'd like to put out a special welcome to the Olympic
athletes and their families who will be joining us here tonight,''
said the deejay to the crowd. The bar was packed, the floor was
throbbing with dance music, but there were no athletes to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Irving and his buddy, David Blight, 19, a University of
Western student, were jazzed about Cathy Freeman's victory in the
400 meters.
</P>
<P>
   At Heineken House, the deejay was playing Queen's ``We Are the
Champions,'' Cyndi Lauper's ``Girls Just Wanna Have Fun'' and the
Weather Girls ``It's Raining Men.'' The makeshift beer hall was
full of Dutch fans wearing bright orange, and there were even
planters of orange tulips.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Bree, a 19-year-old Olympic swimmer from Ireland who
plans to attend the University of Tennessee next year, was loving
it all. He didn't win a medal at this Olympics, but he said he'd be
on the 2004 team in Athens. ``We'll be there. We'll definitely be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   At The Last Lap, an unnamed Sydney Olympics official also was
thinking of Athens _ sort of. ``The Olympics may be back here again
in four years,'' he said. ``Athens has already gotten two red
strikes. One more and the Games revert to the previous host city.''
</P>
<P>
   Now wouldn't that be something. At least the athletes will know
where to party.

   I didn't see Cathy Freeman win the gold medal Monday night, but
I heard it. About 100 of us were standing outside a Sydney Olympic
Park bar watching a television through the window. We had our backs
to the stadium, which was only about 200 yards away, so we could
hear the cheering when it wasn't drowned out by our own chants of
``Let's Go Aussie! Let's Go!'' As the runners came down the
homestretch, the man in front of me got so excited that he started
jumping up and down and I never saw Freeman cross the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   That's OK. I saw the replays. Afterward, I hung around to watch
Michael Johnson's race. I chatted with Carter Hennessey and Ryan
Hewett, who had met at a Sydney youth hostel and decided to see the
Games. ``If someone asks me, `Was I there?' Yeah, I was there,'''
said Carter, a Connecticut native. ``I'm as close as you can

 &HT;    Building boom may be different now, prof says
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Real estate developers and banks usually blame each other when
too many office buildings, hotels and other commercial structures
get built. In fact, there are multiple reasons for overbuilding,
writes Don Sabbarese, co-director of econometrics at Kennesaw State
University, in Business-to-Business (September).
</P>
<P>
   He cites research showing that the 1980s building boom was
caused by ``disaster myopia,'' or excessive optimism within a real
estate market; poor data and weak analysis by lenders; and
``perverse incentives'' _ such as the ``too big to fail'' attitude
in the '80s _ which prevented lenders and regulators from
recognizing excessive risk taking.
</P>
<P>
   With construction cranes sprouting all over, is metro Atlanta
headed for another bout of overbuilding?
</P>
<P>
   ``Disaster myopia'' can never be eliminated, says Sabbarese, but
he sees reason for optimism that the magnitude of any overbuilding
can be controlled.
</P>
<P>
   A reformed Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. now has greater power
over bank lending risk, and public and private sources of real
estate information have improved, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmailing with oil
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein has been escalating tension in the
Persian Gulf since August.
</P>
<P>
   Though military action by Iraq can't be ruled out, the big worry
now is that Saddam might unleash potentially the scariest weapon in
his depleted arsenal _ oil blackmail, Business Week (Oct. 2) says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam's threats are a reminder that the world badly needs
Iraqi oil. World consumption has increased 4.5 million barrels per
day since the Gulf War, and Iraq has again become a key exporter,''
the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, Barron's (Sept. 25) says the president's decision
to sell some of the government's oil reserves won't help American
consumers very much this winter, because refiners are already
running at full speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expect more price volatility,'' the business weekly says.
</P>
<P>
   Indians' big gamble
</P>
<P>
   American Indians have created a $9.6 billion industry in 28
states by operating gambling casinos, which they have the right to
do under U.S. treaty. A byproduct of this is a new stereotype, says
Fortune (Oct. 2) _ the ``rich Indian.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet a trip into Indian country reveals what should come as no
revelation to all: that most of America's 1.7 million Indians are
poor,'' the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the 556 federally recognized tribes, 361 have no gambling
operations at all, and of the 195 that do, just 23 account for 56
percent of revenues,'' the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning ...
</P>
<P>
   Forbes (Oct. 9) is out with its annual edition on the 400
richest people in America. The magazine, which has already
announced the list, devotes all the articles to wealth and the
wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Working Woman (October) says Hispanic women are on the front
line of the U.S. economic boom, leading the nation in starting new
businesses.

 &HT;    Networld+Interop show putting focus on e-business
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If e-business is like a bullet train that's picking up
speed, a lot of transit customers will be in Atlanta this week to
study the rails.
</P>
<P>
   Networking, storage and the other infrastructure that make it
possible for companies and consumers to carry on commerce via the
Internet will be the featured topics for Networld+Interop here this
week, one of the nation's largest technology trade shows.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers expect the show to draw about 50,000 people to the
Georgia World Congress Center for a series of conferences, seminars
and speeches, as well as a huge exhibition of products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do better than last year when there was some impact from
Hurricane Floyd the same week,'' said Will Wise, vice president for
Networld+Interop.
</P>
<P>
   The show formally opens today, although some of the conference's
tutorials and seminars began Sunday. Kicking off the general
session is a talk at 9 a.m. today by one of the world's pre-eminent
executives, Carly Fiorina, chief executive of $42 billion-a-year
Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, the predominant theme was preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Workers carried signs and cell phones around the halls. Others
were lifted by green machines to ceilings to hang banners. Drilling
could be heard, as well as the sound of the Allman Brothers and
other rock 'n' roll music. Meanwhile, hundreds of exhibitors
trooped through the huge facility _ often in matching shirts _ as
they set up their company booths.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the show draws two types of participants. First come
corporate America's representatives who ar responsible for making
decisions about what products and systems are purchased by their
organizations. Then come thousands of technical professionals for
various service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Many in both camps are techies, Wise said.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the largest contingent of attendees are coming
from companies and agencies in metro Atlanta, he said. ``I would
say about 40 or 45 percent of those coming to the show will be in
the no-hotel-room group.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the others are from the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   The show floor _ where potential buyers can talk to the people
doing the selling _ will include 550 exhibitors. They range from
the monsters of the industry _ Cisco Systems, Intel,
Hewlett-Packard _ to 60 just-out-of-the box companies clustered in
``Start-up City,'' Wise said.
</P>
<P>
   Networld+Interop has an annual September show in Atlanta,
another one in Las Vegas each May. Not many attendees go to both _
about 10 percent, Wise said. The company also runs Networld+Interop
shows in Toronto, Sydney, Paris and Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta remains one of the few places in the country with
facilities that can handle a show this large, a group that also
includes Las Vegas, Chicago, Orlando and New Orleans, Wise said.
``There is pretty big, and then there is the World Congress
Center.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who might make a last-minute decisions to attend should
know that some of admissions to the show are free with coupons
available in newspapers, including The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. Charges for an attendee paying for all the
possible offerings would total $2,800. The exhibition floor is open
from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. today and Wednesday and from 10 a.m. to 4
p.m. Thursday. Various seminars continue through Friday.

ON THE MISSISSIPPI, OVER THE TOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: A 600-word information box appears at end of 2nd take.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``When I was a boy there was but one permanent ambition among my
comrades in our village on the West bank of the Mississippi River.
That was to be a steamboatman.'' _ Mark Twain, ``Life on the
Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You think it's going to be just another cruise until they blow
the whistle.
</P>
<P>
   That's the steamboat whistle, and what a sound it is: nothing
less than the voice of the American past. We were sauntering toward
Ol' Man River along the Robin Street Wharf in New Orleans, mildly
cranky that we'd been unable to linger forever over lunch at
Commander's Palace. But we were dutifully making our way to the
Mississippi mooring of the world's largest paddlewheel steamboat,
the American Queen.
</P>
<P>
   That's when its four-foot brass whistle cut loose. There is the
urgency of departure here, the reverberation of countless partings.
But it is also the joyful sound of running free on the Mississippi,
the rush of challenging the fogbound dangers of the ever-shifting
channels. There is warmth and welcome in this bellow. It says, all
aboard: we are safe, we are dry, we offer food and drink and
fellowship and fun.
</P>
<P>
   So, as the whistle shrilled, my wife, Sarah, and I began
pressing forward, eager to get to our cabin, to find our bags, and
to push off for our four-night Huck Finn adventure.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``paddlewheel steamer'' conjures images of
cigar-chomping card sharks, fiery whiskey and a fierier Ava Gardner
on the levee in ``Show Boat,'' trying to conceal her Creole
provenance. But we really had no idea what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of a paddleboat cruise also threatened discomfort,
and we wondered whether this jaunt might be cramped and
interminable. But to give away the ending right here: the trip
exceeded our expectations in almost every respect, and hardly the
least of the entertainments was the mighty Mississippi itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Delta Queen Steamboat Co. offers a confounding variety of
cruises ranging from 3 to 14 nights. Our four-night voyage paddled
away from New Orleans and made Louisiana stops along the
Mississippi at the Oak Alley Plantation, St. Francisville and Baton
Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   Our flight from Newark arrived shortly after 9 a.m. on a
Thursday; the boat wouldn't leave until 7 p.m. So we took a taxi to
the wharf and checked our bags with the American Queen porters. The
day was ours: a grace period, a bit of time to make a leisurely
reconnection with the Big Easy. Back on the air-conditioned
American Queen our bags awaited us in the cabin. The requisite
chocolate was on the pillow, as well as a room key and a way-cool
plastic dining card imprinted with our names and our dinner-table
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling frugally, we had taken an inside cabin on Texas Deck
with two single beds a shower and absolutely no river view at the
two-person discount rate of $2,100 (passengers can spend as much as
$9,240 a person for a two-week cruise).
</P>
<P>
   Though we had jokingly fretted about Lusitania steerage, the
10-by-10-foot cabin and 7-by-4 1/2- foot bathroom were snug but not
oppressively small.
</P>
<P>
   Our cabin, named for the Rosedown Plantation, was hardly spare:
we found floral wallpaper, floral-print bedspreads, a wrought-iron
headboard, Victorianish lighting fixtures and pretty steamboat
prints on the bulkheads.
</P>
<P>
   The cabin did present one challenge: the toilet would not flush.
(This turned out to be a boatwide problem afflicting the
vacuum-powered system; it was fixed by dinner time.)
</P>
<P>
   We wandered about the six-deck, 418-foot-long sternwheeler,
charmed by its bright brasswork, cut-glass doors and the abundance
of chandeliers (which Mark Twain, referring to a long-ago
paddlewheeler, described as ``an April shower of glittering
glass-drops'').
</P>
<P>
   There were parquet floors in the Grand Saloon, hunting trophies
in the Gentlemen's Card Room, and wicker and rattan furniture in
the cheery veranda called _ appropriately _ the Front Porch of
America.
</P>
<P>
   The American Queen still looks new (it was launched in 1995 with
the breaking of the world's largest bottle of McIlhenny Tabasco
Sauce). It is, in a sense, a fantasy of the Victorian steamboat,
built from archival plans and photos from the golden age, including
the J.M. White, the most lavish of the floating hotels, built in
1878 for an unheard of sum, around $250,000, according to the Delta
Queen Steamboat Co.
</P>
<P>
   If the Queen is a regal sight, its over-the-top opulence is not
exactly that of the Hotel Carlyle. But gold swag curtains in the
dining room are hardly bad form on a luxury paddlewheeler. Its
antiques include 100-year-old fireplaces and an 1891 grand piano.
On deck, the Queen's steamboat-Gothic curlicues, fretwork
embellishment and filigree trim seem appropriate, justifying such
19th-century hyperbole as ``floating wedding cake,'' ``gingerbread
palace'' and ``glory boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it isn't a gambling steamer, the vessel offers an
abundance of other amusements. Within minutes we parked our
skeptical New York attitudes and became hooked on the nightly 6:45
p.m. show in the Grand Saloon on the Main Deck. Thankfully, the
shows never took themselves seriously. There was, of course, a
``Show Boat'' medley (what could be finer than hearing ``Ol' Man
River'' belted out while heading up the Mississippi?). Other revues
included a tongue-in-cheek salute to Hollywood and a hugely
entertaining rock 'n' roll parody, all performed by four singers
with strong musical-theater voices accompanied by a seven-member
orchestra, the Steamboatin' Syncopaters.
</P>
<P>
   Big-band dancing in the Grand Saloon, pianoman soirees at the
Captain's Bar and lounge-act dancing and carrying on in the Engine
Room Bar were among additional diversions. Each day, in the Texas
Deck theater, there was a first-run movie video we wanted to see,
but onshore options had a stronger pull. On some days the
attraction was the just-barely-large-enough workout center, with
its half-dozen bikes and treadmills and small pool.
</P>
<P>
   Another draw was the spectacle of the calliope on Promenade
Deck. This instrument, with its 37 gold-plated brass pipes, is
driven by live steam and produces just about the happiest sound
there is.
</P>
<P>
   We often sought the wisdom of the boat's ``Riverlorian,'' Clara
Christensen, an onboard lore-dispenser and lecturer. She was
available much of the day, overseeing the quaint Chart Room where
riverboat-pilot wish-they-weres could consult maps of the
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, shuttle buses delivered passengers from the boat's
moorings to towns, antebellum plantations and cities. Guided tours,
selected by the Delta Queen company and run by local residents,
were of high quality. For example, after our first breakfast on the
Mississippi, we strolled down a landing stage and headed for a tour
of Laura: A Creole Plantation, in Vacherie, La. Our guide was the
owner, Norman Marmillion, who over the past seven years has
orchestrated the 1805 plantation's restoration.
</P>
<P>
   The project has preserved 4 of the original 69 slave cabins
where, according to Marmillion, tales from African-American
folklore, similar to those told by Joel Chandler Harris, the
Georgian author of the Br'er Rabbit stories, were first recorded.
He said they were collected in Creole French at Laura and other
plantations by the folklorist Alcee Fortier, and that the
translations were adapted by Harris for his stories.
</P>
<P>
   Next day, at a new mooring, we toured St. Francisville
(population 1,716) and headed for Catalpa Plantation, where John
James Audubon worked as a tutor, and the Myrtles Plantation, said
to be ``one of America's most haunted houses.''
</P>
<P>
   If we adopted a New Orleans attitude toward the daily tours and
amusements _ too much ain't enough _ in truth, the grandest show
was the simplest: the Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   For us, there was no greater satisfaction than lounging on the
spacious deck, watching Louisiana go by as we steamed through bend
after bend, enjoying the parade of plantations, port facilities and
overgrown riverbank; even the odd tanker dock looked picturesque.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   As river neophytes, we had wondered about seasickness, but for
most of the journey there was little sensation of being on a boat,
save for the faint but reassuring vibration of the engines and the
swift pageant of the riverbank.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The American Queen also offered some little-boy thrills for
passengers fascinated by things nautical, especially by the
workings of a modern steamboat. For example, the 30-foot-wide,
45-ton, bright red paddlewheel is fitted with wooden ``boards''
(more easily replaced, and less dangerous, than steel if the
paddles break when hitting river debris).
</P>
<P>
   An engineering fanfare was achieved with the lowering of the two
black, feathery-crowned smokestacks (the 42-foot above-deck
sections lower on hydraulic hinges), to pass under a river-spanning
power line.
</P>
<P>
   The boat seems to take as its culinary prime directive the
cruise-ship maxim that customers ``shall come on as passengers and
shall leave as cargo.'' The five-course dinners in the 226-seat
dining room offered choices that always included indigenous
specialties such as gumbo with andouille sausage, crawfish etoufee
and fried green tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   The food could be quite good, as when the salmon and the redfish
appeared; alas, the tournedos of beef offered a fine cut of meat
that was devoid of taste, and it was thumbs down on the scallops en
papillote, with six small cold scallops in a tasteless crust. The
heart-healthy options were always safe, despite the nightly
changing, but never-relenting dessert menu, which included such
options as the decadent bread pudding in bourbon sauce, the
sugar-free peach pie and the bananas Foster.
</P>
<P>
   With its crew of 180, the Queen has a passenger capacity of 436
in 222 cabins; our cruise was fully booked with people from 19
states, Germany and Britain. The passengers, many but by no means
all of whom were getting up in years, dressed in sort of golfing
duds for most of the cruise, donning suits and ties (but not tuxes)
and dressy jewelry for such occasions as the Captain's Reception
and the Captain's Dinner.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed that those happiest on the Queen were the passengers
on family reunions, travelers who were inveterate learners or who
had the history bug, and those with an appreciation of the Midwest.
The unhappiest seemed to be young singles, teen-agers and
hypercritical Manhattanites bereft of their real-time Dow Jones
Internet quotes.
</P>
<P>
   Many passengers on our cruise were repeat visitors. ``I just
loved it then and I love it now,'' said Esther Ramsay, of Redmond,
Ore., who took her first steamboat trip in 1977 and described
herself as ``a retiree who loves to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, our jaunt was a voyage of days so filled with
promise that we couldn't wait to get up in the morning. Happily,
when the steamboat moored at our last landing on Monday morning, we
found ourselves ashore in the home of laissez les bons temps
rouler: New Orleans, not exactly the worst alternative to life on
the Mississippi.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Two hours before our flight home, we wandered down Bourbon
Street, only to be caught in an impromptu, pseudo-Mardi Gras parade
through the French Quarter. Masked revelers pelted us with classic
shiny-bead necklaces. Grateful for the gifts, we draped them around
our necks as amulets to ward off the sinister influence of
mundanity as we headed to the airport.  &QL; 
RIVER VOYAGES  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The lowest-end rooms are inside cabins, with twin beds and a
bathroom with shower; the most expensive suites include private
verandas.
</P>
<P>
   There is occasional discounting; through our travel agent we got
a couple's discount, so that my fare cost $1,400 and my wife's cost
$700, for a total of $2,100. Travelers often need to make
reservations months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Our cabin had no TV but a four-channel cabin radio offered live
audio from CNN Headline News.  &QL; 
TRIPS ASHORE  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   American Queen passengers paid $34 a person for their tour
combining both the Laura and Oak Alley Plantations.
</P>
<P>
   The aristocratic French life of New Orleans and the Creole life
of the plantations are described during the visit to Laura, which
is at 2247 Highway 18, Vacherie, La. 70090; (225) 265-7690. The Web
site is www.lauraplantation.com. Vacherie is 35 miles northwest of
New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Oak Alley Plantation is at 3645 Highway 18, Vacherie, La. 70090;
(225) 265-2151. The Web site is www.oakalleyplantation.com. It
takes its name from the quarter-mile row of 28 live oak trees,
planted nearly 300 years ago, that lead from the gate at River Road
to the mansion.
</P>
<P>
   As part of our tour of St. Francisville, we visited the Catalpa
Plantation, 9508 Old U.S. 61, St. Francisville, La. 70775; (225)
635-3372. The owner, Mary Thompson, greeted us with coffee in
bone-china cups as well as sherry in cut-glass tumblers. She led a
vivid and eccentric tour through the house showing her exquisite,
five-generation collection of china, silver, enamels and paintings.
Afterward we were taken by bus to the Myrtles Plantation, 7747 U.S.
61, St. Francisville, La. 70775; (225) 635-6277. (The American
Queen tour visiting both Catalpa and the Myrtles cost $48 a
person.)
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1796 by Gen. David Bradford, a leader of the Whiskey
Rebellion in Pennsylvania two years earlier, the mansion at the
Myrtles has been called ``one of America's most haunted houses.''
The sunny mansion gives little hint of its murder-marred past in
the ordered display of its Baccarat crystal chandeliers, Aubusson
tapestries and Carrara marble mantels.
</P>
<P>
   We also took the Cajun Heritage Tour ($48 for American Queen
passengers), which included a half-hour bus ride to the Bayview
Tavern in Port Vincent, La., a local music hangout on the bayou.
Deborah White, our wry tour guide, proved to be an irrepressible
storyteller on Louisiana politics.
</P>
<P>
   At the Bayview we listened to a talk about Cajun history and
were treated to an all-out Cajun party, with music, Cajun dancing
and jambalaya, the traditional spicy stew of rice, seafood and
chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Information on the tour is available at the Bayview Tavern,
17510 Highway 16, Port Vincent, La. 70726; (225) 698-3147.

ITEMS ON A FUEL SURCHARGE ON U.S. AIR FARES; AN ART NOUVEAU SHOW AT
THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART; AN `URBAN RESORT' IN TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Oct. 1) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 SURCHARGE ON FUEL RAISES AIR FARES IN U.S. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Domestic round-trip air fares rose $20 in early September when
all of the major airlines except Southwest imposed a surcharge that
the industry said is necessary to offset the recent increase in the
price of jet fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The surtax, the second this year, was initiated by Continental
Airlines and promptly matched by American, America West, Delta,
Northwest, United, US Airways and TWA _ airlines that carry about
90 percent of the nation's domestic passengers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Southwest _ which in March added a fuel surtax
from $2 to $8 depending on the length of the flight, but said it
would not go along with the latest increase _ AirTran Airways and
most regional and low-fare airlines also have not added the surtax.
</P>
<P>
   Continental did not give details about its surtax decision,
which was announced on the same day that crude-oil futures closed
above $35.39 a barrel, the highest in nine years (it has since
risen an additional $2). (Airline fuel costs, like the cost of
gasoline, move virtually in tandem with increases in the price of
crude oil.) Northwest said that each one-cent increase in the price
of fuel costs the airline $29 million to $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the airline industry trade group, the Air Transport
Association, has estimated that fuel will cost the carriers $5.5
billion more this year than in 1999, when it cost $10.4 billion.
Through June of this year, the latest month for which figures are
available, aviation fuel was up 59.5 percent, compared with a 3.6
increase for all of 1999. The price of aviation fuel averaged 75
cents a gallon in that six-month period, compared with an average
53.1 cents a gallon in 1999 and 51.3 cents in 1998. Aviation fuel
currently averages about $1 a gallon.

ART NOUVEAU TO STAR AT THE NATIONAL GALLERY  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Art Nouveau, 1890-1914,'' which opens next Sunday at the
National Gallery of Art in Washington, is, according to Paul
Greenhalgh, curator of the exhibition at the Victoria and Albert
Museum, among the most extensive collections of the style ever
presented. The exhibit closed in London in July, and will travel on
to Tokyo in April 2001.
</P>
<P>
   More than 350 works will be on display, including lithographs by
Toulouse-Lautrec and Alphonse Mucha. Also featured are
extraordinary, organically shaped furniture pieces in exotic woods
by Hector Guimard, who designed the plantlike cast-iron entrance
gates to many Paris Metro stations.
</P>
<P>
   Art Nouveau is characterized by its synthesis of structure and
richly ornamental decoration based on natural forms, but
intimations of more stripped-down 20th-century art can be seen in
pieces like Josef Hoffmann's gridlike ``Skyscraper Basket.'' The
exhibition ties together the manifold sources of the style at the
turn of the century, from Celtic revival to the Symbolist movement
and a new interest in Oriental art.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights include dragonfly and cobweb lamps from the
Tiffany Studios and housewares by Frank Lloyd Wright.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition will run through Jan. 28, 2001, at the National
Gallery of Art, East Building. The gallery is open Monday through
Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission
is free. Information: (202) 737-4215, or visit the museum's Web
site at www.nga.gov.

   TEXAS RESORT COMBINES WORK AND PLAY  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Westin Hotels and Resorts' latest property is made for mixing
business and pleasure. The Westin Stonebriar Resort in Frisco,
Texas, which opened Sept. 5 just north of Dallas, is what the
company calls an ``urban resort,'' offering modern business
facilities and country club amenities _ most notably a golf course
by the designer Tom Fazio, scheduled to open Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel, close to a number of major corporate headquarters,
offers 11 meeting rooms and a ballroom with fiber optic wiring and
T1 Internet connections. Besides golf, recreation options include a
200-foot lagoon-style pool, a fitness center and a day spa.
</P>
<P>
   The 300 rooms have high-speed Internet access,
mini-refrigerators and balconies.
</P>
<P>
   The new golf course, the Stonebriar Fazio, will be shared with
the private Stonebriar Country Club, which has a separate clubhouse
and an existing course (not open to resort guests). The Fazio
course measures 7,001 yards from the championship tees and is built
around two lakes with native-grass border areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Westin Stonebriar, at Highway 121 and Legacy Drive in
Frisco, (800) 937-8461, fax (972) 668-8100, is about 30 minutes
from downtown Dallas. Until the end of the year, a standard room
will cost $165 a night; after that, the rate will be $295. Golf
packages are available.

   E-MAIL ABUSE: A coalition of e-mail marketing firms wants to
give consumers ``control'' over messages they receive and has
drafted a set of rules for the industry. If successful, consumers
will see less spam, according to Chris Wolf, president of the
Responsible Electronic Communications Alliance. E-mail could be
sent only to consumers who have given their consent. They also
would be told what personal data are being collected, potential
recipients and the use of such tools as cookies. After public
comment, the rules would go into effect early next year. Firms that
don't comply would be subject to a sliding disciplinary scale.

and calculate rates. The world's largest transportation firm
launched its new and expanded wireless service in the United States
on Monday. Industry officials say wireless devices such as Web
telephones, pagers and digital devices have surpassed personal
computer sales. By 2003, about 1 billion people will own wireless
devices. ``We expect demand for these services to grow rapidly,''
said Robert Conner, UPS director of interactive marketing. FedEx
Corp., a UPS rival, offers wireless connections to its information
system through some portable computers. But UPS says it can tie
into 94 percent of the digital devices on the market _ a far higher
percentage than any competitor.

   CHIPS TO CHINA: IBM Corp. will be the prime supplier of advanced
chips to the company mainly responsible for China's Internet
system. The world's largest maker of computers will supply a
variety of processors and chips to Huawei Technologies Co. as part
of a multiyear contract. While financial terms were not disclosed,
the deal could pave the way for IBM to sell a broader range of
computer products to China.

   E-RESTRUCTURING: NBC Internet is reinventing itself with a major
restructuring of its online operations. The company, whose shares
rose 25 percent after the announcement Monday, will integrate its
consumer Web sites such as Snap.com, Xoom.com and NBC.com under one
brand name and carry content from the NBC, MSNBC and CNBC
television networks. The company also announced it will distribute
customized, co-branded versions of NBCi.com to free Internet-access
services. Its first pact is with Montgomery Ward. NBCi's stock
closed up $1.56 at $7.75.

MORE SHOCK FOR A TEAM WITH A HISTORY OF TRAGEDY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Makes total of stab wounds at least 7)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The feeling is always the same. Experience doesn't
soften the blow or cushion the shock. The reaction to news that a
young man, a world-class athlete, is near death can be as much
physical as it is emotional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had that same emotion all over again,'' Jan Volk said Monday
after learning that Celtics forward Paul Pierce was fighting for
his life after being stabbed in a Boston nightclub. ``You get that
lump in your throat, that pang in your stomach. I know exactly what
it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than three years since Volk was replaced as
general manager of the Celtics. In almost three decades with the
team, he witnessed many great moments, including five world
championships, as well two tragedies from which the franchise is
still reeling. Thoughts of the death of Lenny Bias in 1986 and the
fatal collapse seven years later of Reggie Lewis came rushing back
when he heard the news about Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just a flood of repressed memories when you hear about
this, and you realize it never disappears,'' said Volk. ``It can be
shunted aside, but it will always be there, below the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Auerbach felt the same way. He got an early morning call at
his Washington, D.C., home informing him of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary, it really is,'' Auerbach said. ``You do think
about all the other stuff. But the main thing now is that the kid
is going to be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, of course, the most important difference. Officials at
Boston Medical Center reported that Pierce was in fair and stable
condition after surgery to repair the damage caused by the knife
attack. The Celtics said their star swingman was alert and in good
spirits.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few days, we will learn more about the events at the
club that left Pierce with at least seven stab wounds. He will
continue to recover in his hospital room and his family said he is
looking forward to ``putting this ordeal behind him.'' Yes, Rick
Pitino might have a gaping hole in his lineup. But he will trade
that any day for not having to attend a funeral or having to
comfort a grieving parent.
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach and Volk didn't have that luxury with Bias or Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, fresh off their 16th (and still last) NBA title, the
Celtics had the second pick in the draft and took the sleek, strong
Bias, a star at the University of Maryland. Auerbach had closely
followed Bias's college career and had even counseled the star to
stay in college for the full four years. Larry Bird, then in his
prime, was so enthused by the selection that he said he'd come to
rookie camp, a rarity for a veteran star. Bird said he was looking
forward to playing against Bias in practice and with him during
games. He never got the chance. Bias died a few days after the
draft from a cocaine overdose.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Lewis collapsed during a playoff game in Boston Garden
and was taken to the hospital. Two months later, he collapsed and
died while shooting baskets at Brandeis University. Lewis was the
captain of the Celtics and had been an NBA All-Star. Questions
continue to surround Lewis's death more than seven years after the
fact. The doctor who diagnosed Lewis's heart problem as a benign
fainting condition was cleared in a malpractice lawsuit. However,
Lewis's widow last week sought to reopen her right to appeal the
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   For some scary moments Monday, there was genuine concern that
Pierce might be another Celtic casualty. He suffered stab wounds to
the face, neck, and back. It remains to be seen what happened, why
it happened, and why Pierce _ and no one else _ was stabbed.
</P>
<P>
   But he's going to make it and he is, by all accounts, a most
fortunate individual. Barring further complications, he will be
able to play for the Celtics again.
</P>
<P>
   And that awful feeling that hit home Monday to the Celtics'
executives, while never fully going away, at least had a different
ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``For anyone who has gone through it, you can never be fully
desensitized,'' Volk said. ``I know how (the Celtics) feel. It's a
terrible, terrible feeling. Thankfully, this appears as if it will
have a better result for everybody.''

BARGAINS PREVAIL IN A VERY CROWDED SEA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Mex., Wis., Ariz., Mass.)   (For release Sunday, Oct. 1)  
 By EDWIN McDOWELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year is shaping up as a record for the cruise industry,
officials say, with the number of passengers possibly exceeding 7
million, well above the record 5.8 million in 1998. A major reason,
according to the cruise industry trade group, the Cruise Lines
International Association, is the many low fares this year, which
some industry observers have described as ``the best prices since
1980.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not they have been that low, many cruises have been
priced at less than $100 a night a person, something that has been
rare in the 90s. But low fares are likely to continue this fall and
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The AAA, the biggest leisure travel agency in the United States,
recently declared that cruising was the best value in travel and
that discounts ``should be a staple of the cruise industry for the
foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   As examples, the AAA cited certain seven-day cruises to the
eastern Caribbean through December on Holland America for $599, and
similar discounted fares by Carnival Cruise Lines to both the
eastern and western Caribbean this month. Costa Cruises, in which
the Carnival Corp. has a controlling interest, is offering
seven-night Caribbean trips from Fort Lauderdale beginning next
month from $699 a person.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for such bargains is hardly a mystery: almost 80 new
ships joined the North American fleet during the 1990s, and 52 more
are scheduled by 2005. Altogether, the new ships will add about
77,000 berths to the current 170,000.
</P>
<P>
   But if Premier Cruise Lines calls it quits _ as seems likely
following its abrupt shutdown last month, after its ships were
repossessed by creditors _ it will reduce capacity growth next year
to 10 percent from 12 percent, according to James Winchester, an
analyst with Lazard Freres.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the cruise industry is in ``an overbuilt
situation,'' said Robert C. Biege, the owner of the Cruise Center,
an agency in Elm Grove, Wis. ``The cruise lines' philosophy is,
`Let's get them on board cheap, but get them _ and be sure they
bring their credit card so we can charge for everything.'''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Driscoll, editor in chief of Cruise Week, agrees that
cruise ships _ despite their claims of being all-inclusive _ are
trying to offset the low fares by charging for everything from soft
drinks to hamburgers to alcoholic beverages. But he noted that
Royal Caribbean beat a hasty retreat in June, when after widespread
complaints, it rescinded its $8 charge for 90 minutes on the
Voyager of the Seas' rock climbing wall, and its $6-an-hour fee for
ice skating.
</P>
<P>
   Like other analysts, Driscoll thinks deep discounts will last
throughout 2001. He noted, for example, that published fares for
some Alaskan cruises next year were already 10 percent lower than
this year's.
</P>
<P>
   But the region with the most bargains and the deepest discounts
is still the Caribbean, which this year is expected to attract 45.9
percent of all cruise passengers, according to the Cruise Lines
International Association. All but a handful of its 25 members have
ships in the Caribbean, and the competition is likely to heat up
now that the Disney Magic has begun weekly cruises to the eastern
Caribbean and that Princess plans to keep its 2,600-passenger Grand
Princess in the Caribbean all next year after its repositioning
from Europe this month.
</P>
<P>
   That prospect should sit well with passengers. ``While a lot of
our customers go to Alaska,'' said Alisanne Toomey, of Cruise
Shoppe Travel in Albuquerque, N.M., ``we also sell a lot of
Caribbean cruises because people like the low fares.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Another thing that should sit well with passengers, if not
necessarily those looking for low fares, will be the scheduled
arrival in 2002 of Canyon Ranch's Quest I and Quest II. They will
be the flagships of Canyon Ranch at Sea, a new division of the
health resorts in Lenox, Mass., and Tucson. Each ship will carry up
to 320 guests and, according to a Canyon Ranch spokeswoman, ``will
be a health resort from stem to stern.'' They will have worldwide
itineraries.
</P>
<P>
   Although many discounts are announced in ads and over the
Internet, many are also passed along in less obvious ways,
particularly for luxury cruises, for which fares can easily exceed
$700 a day a person. These include offering discount air fares to
and from the ship's departure city, or cutting fares for those who
pay well in advance.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the rate for a cabin on the veranda deck of
Radisson's Paul Gauguin during its weekly round trips from Tahiti
in 2001 is $5,495 a person _ but $300 less for those booking 120
days prior to sailing.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers on Windstar's seven-day Costa Rica trips next January
and February have a choice of three bonuses: $299 round-trip air
fare from Miami, two free hotel nights in Costa Rica plus $399
round-trip air fare from Miami, or 5 percent off the cruise fare,
which starts at $2,482.
</P>
<P>
   Those who pay a deposit at least six months ahead for a cruise
of six or more nights on any of the Delta Queen Steamboat Co.'s
ships next year, can choose free round-trip air fare, a $250 a
person travel allowance, or two free nights in a hotel in any of a
dozen port cities, including Chicago, St. Louis and New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Facing greater competition in popular Panama Canal trips,
Crystal Cruises is cutting fares as much as 50 percent on five such
cruises between mid-November and Dec. 20, and eight more next year.
</P>
<P>
   While it may seem that cruise lines will soon run out of new
destinations, many of them avoid offering the same itinerary over
and over by adding a twist or two. Silversea Cruises, for example,
will return this fall to Australia for the fourth time, but for the
first time it will sail around the western coast, visiting
Fremantle, Adelaide and Broome.
</P>
<P>
   Windstar is adding New Zealand to its Pacific cruises starting
late next year, with its Wind Song scheduled for 10 trips of 10
days each, visiting ports on both the North and South Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Many other ships have new or additional itineraries in Asia or
the South Pacific, a region where the number of cruises this year
will rise to 237, compared with 192 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The number of South American cruises has doubled in five years,
to 72. Cunard Line's refurbished Caronia (formerly the Vistafjord)
will sail the west coast of South America from January through
March, then make two voyages between Fort Lauderdale and the Amazon
River.
</P>
<P>
   The Celebrity Mercury, in its first full season in South
America, has a 15-day cruise leaving Buenos Aires on Feb. 22. It
will spend two days in Rio de Janeiro during Carnaval, with
passengers getting seats in the Sambadrome for the main Carnival
parade. Crystal has five South American cruises from January
through March. Norwegian Cruise Line will increase its berths in
South America by almost 300 beginning this December, when it
replaces the Norwegian Majesty with the 1,748-passenger Norwegian
Dream.
</P>
<P>
   A new destination is Cuba. Beginning Nov. 18, the Cuba Cruise
Corp., a division of Blyth &AMP; Co. Travel of Toronto, will begin
twice-weekly cruises there from Nassau, the Bahamas. They will be
aboard a 550-passenger ship, the Funchal, then after three weeks,
the 350-passenger Arion, both of which will be renamed La Habana
for these voyages. Except for the inaugural cruise, which departs
on a Saturday, the three-night cruises will depart Thursday, and
the four-night cruises on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Longer cruises are the most profitable for cruise lines, because
they attract bigger spenders to begin with and offer more exotic
and more expensive land tours. But changing lifestyles, which often
make it difficult to fit a weeklong or 10-day cruise into work
schedules, have resulted in a bumper crop of shorter cruises.
Cruise Lines International figures show that there were 1,468
three-to-five-day cruises in 1999 and that there will be nearly
2,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   For those who haven't noticed, informal dress pretty much reigns
aboard ship. Now Norwegian Cruise Line is making it more or less
official. Instead of the usual two ``formal nights'' during a
seven-day cruise, this summer, Norwegian announced ``resort
casual'' for the whole cruise with one optional formal night aboard
the Norwegian Sky, and it plans to expand the casual code to its
entire fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in what Norwegian describes as a way to simplify things
for passengers, tips will automatically be added to on-board
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from bargain fares, the most notable change in cruising
this year is the virtual omission of what was all the rage this
time last year: millennium cruises, those overpriced voyages
designed to see who and what ships would be first to welcome last
year's faux millennium and bid goodbye to the old. This New Year's
Eve, there will be the usual number of year-end voyages, but there
has been little talk of welcoming the actual millennium.
</P>
<P>
   As the ball is descending in Times Square on Dec. 31, Celebrity
Cruises' new 1,950-passenger Millennium is scheduled to be midway
between Fort Lauderdale and Key West, thousands of miles from the
international date line and those islands and atolls that many
considered the place to be last New Year's Eve. As of this writing,
there are still berths available.

COMMENTARY: A HOT BUTTON ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Public Interests) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The presidential campaign has stopped talking about nuclear
defense because married women, the critical swing voters, aren't
supposed to be interested. (Our motto: If it hasn't come up on
Regis it can't be all that important.)
</P>
<P>
   Look, we're not going to be satisfied with six weeks of
prescription drug coverage and dragging Dick Cheney to kindergarten
show-and-tell sessions. We are thinking people. We ponder the big
stuff. We do not quail at the mention of the word ``pixels.'' (As
in ``How many pixels does it take to make an exoatmospheric kill
vehicle?'')
</P>
<P>
   You're ready to talk weaponry, and you probably already know
more than you think. Check your nuclear IQ:
</P>
<P>
   1. In its last three tests, the hardware for the Clinton
administration's proposed $60 billion antimissile defense program
has hit:
</P>
<P>
   A) Three targets.
</P>
<P>
   B) Two targets.
</P>
<P>
   C) One target that was flying in front of a large bright
balloon.
</P>
<P>
   2. Explaining the latest $100 million failure, the head of the
Pentagon Ballistic Missile Defense Organization said:
</P>
<P>
   A) ``We're closing the pixel gap.''
</P>
<P>
   B) ``It all depends on what you mean by the word `hit.'
</P>
<P>
   C) ``This is rocket science.''
</P>
<P>
   3. The missile shield is supposed to protect the United States
against weapons launched by ``rogue nations'' like North Korea. The
Clinton administration has abolished the term ``rogue nation'' in
favor of:
</P>
<P>
   A) ``Diplomatically challenged nation.''
</P>
<P>
   B) ``The nation formerly known as rogue.''
</P>
<P>
   C) ``State of concern.''
</P>
<P>
   If you guessed C on every question, you are very well versed in
nuclear weapons issues, and qualified to head the Senate Armed
Services Committee. (The current chairman, John Warner of Virginia,
recently demanded of an expert witness: ``Look straight into the
cameras and say, `We are, as a nation, defenseless.''')
</P>
<P>
   You are also way ahead of your fellow citizens, who believe we
already have a system that will shoot down any incoming missiles.
When told that no such item exists, a quarter of the respondents in
one poll said we should build one even if it isn't actually going
to work.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us in the Bush-Gore generation were not raised to put
much faith in the defensive side of military technology. As
youngsters, we were told that we could ward off a nuclear attack by
hiding under our desks with our heads down.
</P>
<P>
   We spent the gulf war watching those Patriot missiles on CNN,
weapons apparently so precise they could trail an Iraqi Scud down
the street and into a saloon, and blast it right off the bar stool.
It was only much later that we learned the Patriots may not have
ever hit anything, and that the secret to our defense against the
Scuds was that the Scuds were lousy weapons.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush and Al Gore both support an antimissile program,
although Gore's heart doesn't seem to be entirely in it. The vice
president is cautious _ what about the downside? If we put up a
shield, the Chinese could respond by simply adding more missiles.
We could raise the odds of an attack, and then the shield might not
work when it happens. (Unless we get lucky and the North Koreans
decide to assail us with large balloons.)
</P>
<P>
   Bush, characteristically, goes for something more daring. (When
the last interceptor flunked its test due to a computer glitch,
Bush suggested that the problem was a lack of ``the right
leadership.'') His shield proposal is frequently referred to as
``robust'' _ the French roast of ballistic missile defense. Further
details, such as what it would look like and how much it will cost,
will become available after the inauguration. ``He is an excellent
decision maker, but you don't have time on the campaign trail, nor
really the resources on the campaign trail, to make a decision of
this magnitude,'' his foreign policy adviser, Condoleezza Rice,
told The Washington Post last week.
</P>
<P>
   If the recollections of their old friends are right, Bush and
Gore were two early baby boomers who didn't spend their youth
practicing what to do if the Soviet Union decided to bomb their
classrooms. ``Down here we had tornado drills,'' said John Bizilo,
who was principal of Bush's elementary school in Midland, Texas. No
wonder Bush is a diplomatic risk-taker. He was raised to fear
Mother Nature more than Mother Russia. (BOX)

 &HT;    Bulldogs look to special teams for edge against Arkansas
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS - Georgia will be looking for any type of edge when it
tries to snap Arkansas' 16-game home winning streak on Saturday.
And, for the first time in a couple of seasons, the Bulldogs may
find one in their special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's special teams have improved this season, especially in
punt returns and punting. Meanwhile, the Razorbacks' specialists
haven't been so special this season.
</P>
<P>
   Bulldogs punter Jonathan Kilgo, a sophomore from Silver Creek,
ranks third in the SEC with an average of 42.4 yards per punt. He
trails only Mississippi State's Prentiss Cole (44.0) and Auburn's
Damon Duval (43.2) in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia hasn't had a punter average more than 42 yards per punt
since Cris Carpenter averaged 44.1 yards in 1986. Carpenter was the
last Bulldogs punter to earn All-SEC honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've only been average this season,'' Kilgo said.
``One thing I really need to work on is my pooch punting. When
we're facing the end zone, that can be a big factor as far as field
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia was concerned about punt returns after receiver Michael
Greer, who handled those duties the past two seasons, was suspended
for the first five games. But redshirt freshman Damien Gary, who
missed last season with a thumb injury, ranks fifth in the SEC in
punt returns, averaging 9.8 yards on 10 returns. The Bulldogs have
had only two players average more than 10 yards on punt returns the
past eight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   However, not all of the Bulldogs' special teams have been
consistent. Kicker Brett Kirouac was replaced by walk-on Billy
Bennett after he missed his second extra-point attempt of the
season in Saturday's 37-0 victory over New Mexico State.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, a left-footed freshman from Athens Academy, kicked two
extra points and a 43-yard field goal against the Aggies. He's
expected to keep the place-kicking chores against the Razorbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Special teams are a big concern for Arkansas coach Houston Nutt.
The Razorbacks have had several breakdowns this season, and kicker
Matt Swartz had made only 2-of-5 field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Arkansas' special teams were a comedy of errors in
Saturday's 28-21 victory over Alabama:
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second quarter, a punt bounced off Arkansas
receiver George Wilson's knee and Alabama recovered at the Tide 42.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the third quarter, a poor snap allowed the Tide to
block Swartz's 36-yard field goal attempt.
</P>
<P>
   After a Cedric Cobbs TD cut Alabama's lead to 21-20 in the third
quarter, the Razorbacks never got off the point-after attempt
because of another botched snap.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the fourth quarter, Alabama blocked a punt when free
safety Ken Hamlin missed a block. The Tide reached the Arkansas 20,
but missed a field-goal attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Those mistakes came a week after the Razorbacks missed two field
goals, had a punt blocked and gave up a kickoff return for a
touchdown in a 38-31 victory over Boise State.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is going to be more of a sense of urgency,'' Nutt said.
``We're going to look at everything. The first thing is they are
not going to sit down in practice. The (kickers) may not kick their
legs out for two hours, but they are going to be holding, snapping
and working on their execution as long as the team is practicing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get better, and if we get that part better,
we'll be in every game.''

 &HT;    Falcons' Anderson tempers remarks made after loss to St. Louis
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. - Atlanta Falcons running back Jamal
Anderson on Monday backed off the pronouncement he made after
Sunday's 41-20 loss to the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Anderson had said he was ``definitely going to
have a talk with a couple guys to see if they're serious.'' But on
Monday, he again echoed the idea that players have to look within
themselves to see if they are giving it their all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always going to start with Jamal,'' he said. ``I'm going
to see where I can play better, . . . and I think that's going to
go for everybody on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night at Philadelphia, some players apparently will do
their soul-searching from the bench. Coach Dan Reeves said he will
make lineup changes.
</P>
<P>
   Most fingers are pointing to the offensive line. While the line
was not responsible for all eight St. Louis sacks, most offensive
failures, and successes, start there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to get our best people in there,'' Reeves said. The
line has worked rookie starter Travis Claridge and Ephraim Salaam
at right tackle, starter Anthony Redmon and Claridge at right guard
and starter Bob Hallen and Chris Banks at left guard.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves would not get specific about lineup changes. ``We've got
to try to get people in there and . . . see if we can get better.''
</P>
<P>
   The line has changed a lot since last year. Starting center
Robbie Tobeck and right guard Gene Williams are gone. Salaam lost
his starting job in the summer when surgery on his right knee
caused him to miss five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Collins, who started every game at left guard when the
Falcons went to the Super Bowl in 1998, has struggled at center.
Sunday was not the first time he snapped the ball on the wrong
count, but it was the first time it precipitated an interception by
Chris Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Some league personnel men think that Collins' best spot is
guard. Tobeck, now on injured reserve after signing a contract with
Seattle as a free agent, was very effective calling blocking
schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Collins is not as assertive as Tobeck, and there sometimes is
confusion along the line, occasionally after the snap.
</P>
<P>
   Even the dean of the line, nine-year veteran Bob Whitfield,
doesn't fit the role of outspoken leader. But Whitfield agrees that
every man has to take care of his job to make it all work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a real vocal person that way,'' he said. ``There
shouldn't be (any) misunderstandings. Even in a team sport, there's
an individual component.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler took seven of the eight sacks, but he did not criticize
the line. ``It's not just the line,'' he said. ``It might be the
backs. It might be me. It might be a receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the quarterback said he can relate to Anderson's
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're not doing as well offensively as we feel we should,
. . . there comes a time when you say, `We've got to make a change
to make it work,' `` Chandler said. ``I think that's where Jamal is
coming from.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys up front have a hard job. Every week, (defenses)
throw another package at them. It's the ability on Sunday to adjust
to it, and I don't know if we've done that real well.''
</P>
<P>
   The implication is that coaching also is an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves agreed. ``One of the things we did poorly staff-wise was
we didn't adjust,'' he said. ``They did a corner blitz an awful
lot. We talk about it on the sideline, but we still didn't make
probably as good of an adjustment as we needed.''

7,000 PASSENGERS IN THE SAME BOAT - SEEKING REFUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif. , Wis., Va.)  (For release Sunday, Oct. 1.) 
 By BETSY WADE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Sept. 14, with 2,800 passengers aboard five vessels in the
Bahamas, Cozumel, Mexico and Nova Scotia, Premier Cruises was shut
down.
</P>
<P>
   For me, this was not just a news report; I was a Premier
passenger in June, and my cruise was a bust. Along with my husband
and three of our grandchildren, I had gotten as far as Boston on a
cruise to Nova Scotia out of New York when the company gave up
trying to fix the air-conditioning on the Big Red Boat II and
canceled after two days. All 992 passengers aboard were promised
full refunds as well as vouchers for a future date. The line then
sent us back to New York on buses.
</P>
<P>
   Our crushed, weary grandchildren were met by their parents, who
had been summoned by cell phone after two days of their first
child-free week in 14 years. No one who has lost a vacation needs
more grim details.
</P>
<P>
   Every week from then on, our travel agent called Premier about
the promised refund. We had paid $2,834 in all, starting with
deposits in mid-April, all charged to American Express. On Sept. 8,
our agent, Anne Davies of Linden Travel in New York _ who is
retiring from the travel business _ said that she could no longer
reach the woman she had been speaking with in Premier's accounting
department. Instead, she was getting a taped message from the
refund department saying ``every effort'' was being made to provide
refunds, but five canceled or shortened trips made it impossible to
handle the high volume of calls.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, Premier, a privately held company with a capacity
of over 5,000 passengers, stopped operating.
</P>
<P>
   Failure has no sponsors. Bruce Nierenberg, president and chief
executive officer of Premier, said in an interview after the
shutdown that in effect, he had not been in charge of the line
since April. Nierenberg said that Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, an
investment bank that had lent the line $55 million in 1998 with
five vessels as collateral, had really been running things.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette precipitated the shutdown by
abruptly seizing four mortgaged ships on Sept. 14; Catherine M.
Conroy, a spokeswoman for the banking company, said it feared that
other creditors would get there first, and that it also wanted to
ensure the orderly debarkation of passengers. The fifth mortgaged
vessel, the Seawind Crown, being operated under charter in the
Mediterranean, was seized in Barcelona, said Alan Twaits, Premier's
counsel; however, Conroy said the banking company had not seized
it. A sixth vessel, our own Big Red Boat II, which Premier was
operating under charter, was recovered by its British owner,
Oceanic Marine Ltd., at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Twaits, who during the week of Sept. 10 had the unhappy task of
announcing that the company was laying off virtually everyone
remaining on its staff, supplied a rough tally of the passengers to
whom Premier had earlier promised refunds for cancellations or
shortened cruises.
</P>
<P>
   The total is inexact because the company rebooked passengers who
chose to try again, in addition to giving them vouchers for another
time. Some disappointed passengers were transferred immediately to
another Premier boat, or got another cruise. Our kids loved their
one day at sea, the games and computer room and the cabin steward,
I Wayan Muryartha, who twisted their towels into swans; they were
ready to go again immediately, but other obligations made that
impossible, so we asked for the refund.
</P>
<P>
   Twaits' record showed that a canceled June 3 New York-Nova
Scotia trip of the Big Red Boat II had 800 passengers booked; its
June 10 round trip was completed, although the anchor snagged a
power cable in Newport, R.I.; its canceled June 17 trip had 775
passengers, of whom 230 did not transfer to another vessel; our
June 24 trip ended in Boston when all 992 passengers were put
ashore (no other ship was available to take those who wished to
continue). In Houston, 1,210 passengers never got aboard the Big
Red Boat III for a cruise June 10 because a tug damaged a
propeller; the June 17 cruise, with 1,140 passengers, was also
canceled for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum possible number of claimants in these figures would
be 4,372. Twaits said many refunds had been made; our travel agent
was told by the Premier employee that she was starting on refunds
for June 24 just before she was replaced by the taped message.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated 2,800 passengers put ashore Sept. 14 and 15 at the
time of the vessels' seizure would bring the potential total to
about 7,200. Beyond that are the unknown number of people who paid
for or made deposits on cruises leaving on Sept. 16 and later.
</P>
<P>
   What are the avenues of recourse for passengers who got no
cruise or a partial cruise and no refund? Twaits said that 20
percent of Premier's passengers had not used credit cards. The 80
percent who did and who hold reservations for cruises that will
never take place should seek a refund through the credit-card
company first, as soon as possible. For bank-linked credit cards,
contact should be made with the issuing bank. American Express
prints an 800 number on its cards for use in disputing charges.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Reynolds, a senior attorney at the Federal Trade
Commission in Washington, says that the Fair Credit Billing Act of
1974 provides two avenues for claims in such situations.
</P>
<P>
   First, Reynolds said, is the billing-error provision (which the
American Society of Travel Agents is recommending to agents and
consumers in writing to their card companies). The billing error
involved is something that was not delivered as agreed.
</P>
<P>
   A drawback is that the law says the cardholder should send a
letter reporting the problem within 60 days of the mailing date of
the bill with the error. Reynolds says that a claim should be made
even if the 60 days have expired, and three major card issuers say
that Premier passengers who used their cards ``will be protected,''
whether they have paid the bill containing the Premier charge or
not. The companies use varying language to describe their policies,
but the message is that they are prepared to cancel or refund
Premier charges for those who lost their cruises. The banks or
companies then have to pick through the remnants of Premier to get
their money.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Healy, a spokesman for Visa USA, said that Visa cardholders
have 120 days from the ``expected delivery date,'' meaning the date
they would have boarded the ship, to dispute a charge. William P.
Binzel, a vice president of MasterCard, said that the issuing banks
in his organization had a provision for refunds on something
ordered for ``delayed delivery'' that does not arrive a long time
after payment has been made. Nancy Muller, a spokeswoman for
American Express, said that the Premier collapse would be a typical
billing dispute: American Express gives the cardholder a temporary
credit, and if it gets no response from an inquiry to Premier, the
credit becomes permanent.
</P>
<P>
   The second avenue cited by Reynolds of the FTC is the ``claims
and defenses'' provision. This applies to amounts that have been
billed but not paid. Three tests must be met: That the cardholder
made a good-faith attempt to resolve the problem with the merchant;
that the amount involved is more than $50 and that the transaction
took place in the state where the cardholder lives, or within 100
miles of the home address.
</P>
<P>
   Most states have laws governing where phone transactions take
place. A good argument can be advanced that someone who calls a
travel agent from home and then gives the agent a credit card
number over the phone has made a transaction from home, wherever
the agent may be. The ``billing error'' route is probably the
better way to approach the problem, even for those who have not
paid the bill with the Premier charge in it.
</P>
<P>
   For those who take that approach, the American Society of Travel
Agents has prepared a model letter for a billing-error complaint
that its member travel agents can provide to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the passengers who lost their cruises were in a
relatively fortunate position, because they had bought
trip-cancellation insurance, as we had. Our policy, which cost
$257, was chosen by our agent from CSA Travel Protection, which is
a supplier recommended by the consortium her agency belongs to.
</P>
<P>
   The CSA policy covers default of the travel operator. Some
policies limit payment of benefits to situations where an operator
declares formal bankruptcy; others exclude default as a reason for
claims. Claudia Fullerton, a spokeswoman for CSA, which is based in
San Diego, said her company would probably have $500,000 in claims
from Premier passengers. She said on Sept. 20 that the company was
already receiving calls from policyholders at (800) 348-9505 and
was sending out claim forms. Fullerton further said that agents
were advising clients that seeking a refund from their credit cards
was an option, but were not requiring that they do this before
filing an insurance claim.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Tom Zavadsky, an executive vice president of Travel Guard in
Stevens Point, Wis., said that his company expected $1.5 million in
Premier claims. ``Our phone is ringing off the hook,'' he said,
adding that the company's agents, rather than sending out claim
forms, were taking client information over the phone and entering
it into the computer on the spot. The number is (800) 826-1300.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Godlin, senior vice president of World Access of Richmond,
Va., which sells Access America policies, said that she expected
her company would have $1 million in claims. She said that when the
company began to receive calls, she ran a report and found that in
the collapse of Regency Cruises almost exactly five years ago,
Access America paid $1.5 million in claims.
</P>
<P>
   Some people will get their money back under a combination of
claims. Dan McGinnity, a spokesman for Travel Guard, said that in
another case, a policyholder had spent $30,000 for a deluxe cruise
that was canceled, and the credit-card company covered only
$18,000. Travel Guard paid the rest, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The third source of compensation for the lost fares is a surety
bond ($15 million in Premier's case) that the Federal Maritime
Commission requires cruise companies to take out. The Government
requires the bond as evidence of financial responsibility and as a
way to indemnify passengers and others for deaths or injuries, or
for nonperformance by passenger vessels. The bond size, according
to Sandra L. Kusumoto, a spokeswoman for the commission, is based
on passenger revenue and is typical for cruise ships because they
take deposit money for cruises far into the future. This bond
covers only cruise payments, and not the cost of air fare to or
from a port.
</P>
<P>
   The yield from the bond is intended to compensate those who will
not get help from credit cards or trip insurance. The bond is
underwritten by the Greenwich Insurance Co. and NAC Reinsurance.
The handling of claims and other matters will be directed by a law
firm retained by the insurers and by companies experienced in
liaison between lawyers and passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The Regency collapse five years ago went through bankruptcy
court, and the proceedings dragged on for months and months. George
B. Freehill of Freehill, Hogan &AMP; Mahar of New York, a lawyer
working on this case who also worked on the Regency case, said that
duplicate claims had created huge delays, but that everyone the
firm could identify was paid by the insurer. He said that some
claimants were still being sought. The information he and the
Federal Maritime Commission are issuing urges all Premier claimants
to start with their credit-card companies and trip-cancellation
insurers.
</P>
<P>
   ``By filing a claim with the credit card company, or under any
applicable travel policy, the passenger will avoid the delays that
inevitably occur in the investigation and claims- settling
process,'' the Freehill statement says.
</P>
<P>
   Those who paid for canceled cruises by check or cash, the
statement continues, may obtain claim forms and instructions by
calling (212) 425-1883, faxing (212) 425-0392 or sending an e-mail
message to premier(at)freehill.com. The Web sites of the Federal
Maritime Commission (www.fmc.gov) and the insurance company
(www.nacre.com) both have the full text of the announcement. A Web
page is being set up by the legal organizations involved in the
claims process.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, I have worthless cruise vouchers to give to the kids.
They would rather have had the trip to Nova Scotia. I am sure the
same goes for the rest of the claimants.

<P>
   CLARKSDALE, Miss. _ In Eastern Kentucky, a 15-year-old boy
dreams of quitting school to make real money working at a pizza
parlor. Here in Clarksdale, a 68-year-old widow thanks God that she
can manage the $200-a-month rent on a house one good rain could
wash away. In East St. Louis, Ill., a 20-year-old mother of six
wishes she could find a public housing project where the broken
glass on the stoop is swept away.
</P>
<P>
   Poor people learn to keep hopes small. So when President Clinton
came calling on some of the poorest places in the country last year
with ideas to make things better, it was like rain in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   The president's six-state, four-day poverty tour, highlighting
for the first time in his two terms the places that remain
untouched by the longest economic boom in this nation's history,
caused an excitement that bordered on the spiritual. He was like a
charismatic preacher, stirring the congregation to believe.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the president's modest proposals for tax
incentives to bring businesses to impoverished communities are
still awaiting Senate approval. The idea that anything big might
happen to places that have been down longer than they were ever up
has long faded. And so is the notion, if it ever existed, that the
federal government is the answer to the empty downtowns, idle
laborers and the dilapidated buildings all too common in these
communities.
</P>
<P>
   In a presidential election season, when the two main candidates
are suggesting that everyone should benefit from the nation's
prosperity, the people who might be buoyed by the words have little
use for national politics. In dozens of interviews in communities
the president visited _ Clarksdale, East St. Louis and the Eastern
Kentucky towns of Hazard and Annville _ what was clear was that
Democrats are Democrats, Republicans are Republicans and people are
more concerned with how to fix their own communities than in the
state of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the extensive attention given Robert F. Kennedy's tour of
poor communities as a presidential candidate in 1968, Clinton's
tour was a day's headlines. And perhaps because this is the age of
welfare changes, the places Clinton visited expected little beyond
the visit. East St. Louis, which looks left over from a bombing, is
bent on proving that it is not the urban war zone it became known
as a decade ago. Appalachia, which is humming along, in parts, is
concerned with telling the world that it is not a haven for
barefooted hillbillies in shotgun shacks.
</P>
<P>
   CLARKSDALE: Facing Adversity, Showing Resilience
</P>
<P>
   Clarksdale, in the heart of the Mississippi Delta, is determined
to prove that with grit, it will not only endure, but prevail.
</P>
<P>
   It is, as the mayor says, ``resilient in the face of
adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   The morning of the day the president came to town, Sheila Fair
opened Ooo So Pretty flowers and gifts at the regular time, 9 a.m.
Fair nodded to the Secret Service agents on the roof, said hey to
the ones who had been hanging around the store for 10 days and
managed to take a few orders for bouquets.
</P>
<P>
   Her store, on the corner of a nearly abandoned strip of downtown
Issaquena Street, had been chosen as the site of a meeting between
the president and local small-business owners. Word was that he was
bringing ways to lure businesses that fled to Route 61 back to
town, besides enticing new ones.
</P>
<P>
   But Fair, barely getting by after 21 years in business, would
bet on just two things that day. It would be hotter than heck, and
Clinton's visit would make great pictures.
</P>
<P>
   She was right. When Clinton strolled through the tired, broken
streets of downtown, sweating enough for two men in the 105-degree
heat, it was the most exciting thing to happen to Clarksdale
(population 22,000) in a long time. Maybe ever. He passed the
boarded Roxy Theater, the closed-down Pac-Man lounge and the
falling-down wooden houses as if he was right at home. Then he came
into Ooo So Pretty and listened to people sing the business blues
for about an hour, a lot longer than his schedulers had planned.
</P>
<P>
   And then, he left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great Kodak moment,'' Fair said.
</P>
<P>
   As she expected, nothing has really changed on Issaquena Street.
Like so many downtown buildings abandoned for highway strips, the
Roxy (the mayor pointed it out to the president as a place that
might make a great cultural center with some kind of grant or loan)
is still boarded. The Pac-Man lounge is still closed. The falling
down houses look ready to give up completely.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Newson is still putting in the long hours at Newson's
Auto Parts, in a block-long building, inherited from his dad,
across the street from Ooo So Pretty. Newson opens at 7 and stays
until 7 or 8 to compete with the Wal-Mart and Auto Zone on Route
61. ``Right now,'' he said, ``it's just like the president never
came.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people say the same thing. Hardly anyone blames the
president, though. In Clarksdale, people pay as little attention to
Washington politics as Washington politics pays to them. No one
faults any of the presidential candidates for not coming around;
they are used to being ignored.
</P>
<P>
   They tend to blame Wal-Mart for their problems, for stealing
business from downtown. Or Memphis, 75 miles away, for stealing
brain power. Or the local politicians, for letting downtown slip
into a coma without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   They blame themselves, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``People got to want to improve,'' said Ethel Mae Clark, sitting
on her mother's porch on downtown Yazoo Street. Next door was a
boarded shack of a house. Across the street, where houses used to
be, was a lot overrun with weeds.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who lives nearby, has diabetes and a failing kidney, and
her world is framed by the $400 Social Security check she receives
each month. Her mother, Martha Riley, who sitting on the porch
sewing a quilt under a sign for ``Pigee's Beauty Salon'' _ a
remnant of her landlord's defunct business _ is in similar straits.
Riley pays $200 a month rent for the house and wishes she could
afford better. She blames not being able to read or write for her
lot. ``Here,'' she said, ``things just get worser.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clarksdale is a proud old place. Some of the biggest
names in the blues walked these streets. Muddy Waters and John Lee
Hooker grew up in town. Bessie Smith died here.
</P>
<P>
   The Delta Blues Museum, which is fighting for financing from the
Clarksdale Board of Commissioners, attracts visitors from all over
the world. Tony Czech, the director, showed off the guest book to
prove it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at these,'' Czech said, leafing through a few pages that
revealed addresses from Paris, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany and
Alaska. ``And these are just over a couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   But after these visitors tour the museum, they have nowhere else
in Clarksdale to go.
</P>
<P>
   In May, J.C. Penney closed its downtown store and replaced it
with a catalog store next door to a former pharmacy, which had
moved to Route 61.
</P>
<P>
   For the really poor people, shopping means taking a long walk
along a busy road. Local bus service is nonexistent. And in
Clarksdale, 40 percent of the residents have incomes below the
poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Webster Jr., the mayor, had hoped the president's visit
would lead to real change. But Webster is not surprised that it did
not. ``We Deltans have learned to be resilient,'' he said.
``Resilient in the face of adversity. Just the fact that we are
able to live and work here is a sign of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are occasional cries of desperation. Dave Williams, a
part-time carpenter, started calling out, ``Factories! Factories!''
when he saw a reporter and photographer walking around town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Factories,'' Williams shouted. ``We need some factories
here.''
</P>
<P>
   He has lived here all his life, 42 years, but cannot see
sticking it out much longer. ``I would like to have a full-time
job,'' Williams said. ``So would a lot of people. I know a friend
of mine, he's living in one of those cattle boxes that sit on the
tracks. So are a lot of people. See for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   On a scorching day, there was no one in the metal cars. Hardly
anyone walked the streets, either, except for a twig-skinny woman
who asked for $5 for a fix, and a man gathering cans in a plastic
grocery bag.

<P>
   EAST ST. LOUIS: SELF-HELP IS SEEN AS THE SOLUTION
</P>
<P>
   It was Sunday, the sun shining like a halo, and the streets of
East St. Louis were virtually empty, as though the city had been
warned of an air raid.
</P>
<P>
   This made the abandoned buildings all over town stand out in
bold relief. From boarded churches to closed-down gas stations and
burnt-out houses and storefronts, the rotting buildings, more than
1,500 in all, mocked the city's pride, marring every neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses, even on State Street, the main drag, are few and far
between. The city's only places to eat are the kind that measure
customers by the millions. So many businesses have left that when
the president stopped by on his poverty tour, the best example of a
positive economic growth that the city could come up with was a new
Walgreen's.
</P>
<P>
   East St. Louis, with about 32,000 residents, 99 percent of them
African-American, is clearly one very poor city. About 40 percent
of the residents live below the federal poverty line of $16,600 for
a family of four. A three-bedroom house can be bought for $10,000.
The unemployment rate is more than 10 percent, twice the national
average.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, with an entourage that included the Rev. Jesse Jackson
and several Cabinet members, promised that East St. Louis would not
be forgotten. But while his brief visit has yielded little concrete
change, residents overwhelmingly vote Democratic, all the time. Few
people have anything but praise for the president's gestures toward
their city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The visit shed a lot of light on the things that we have to
offer,'' said Greg Lewis, one of a dozen members of the local
Democratic club who was spending his Sunday afternoon renovating a
building the club recently bought for its headquarters. ``A lot of
it,'' Lewis added, to a chorus of yeahs, ``depends on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other members of the committee, Lewis, who is 38, the
father of two boys, 12 and 15, and a relocation supervisor in St.
Louis, could not say enough good things about his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I have a six-figure income between us,'' he said.
``We live in this city because we believe in it. The stigma is
something we're trying to get away from.''
</P>
<P>
   Told that the city looks grim, Lewis and other residents talk
about how much it has improved from 10 years ago. The police cars
did not have working radios and the fire engines would not run.
Trash piled high in the streets because the city had no money to
hire haulers. In 1990, a man who was physically abused while in
jail sued East St. Louis and won, forcing the city to turn over the
deed to City Hall to satisfy the court judgment. And when things
seemed like they could not get any worse, they did. In 1991, the
city posted 68 homicides, a record.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with tax revenue from the Casino Queen riverboat, which
opened here in 1993, just across the Mississippi River from St.
Louis' Gateway Arch, and the new $15 million waterfront hotel
adjacent to it, the city can afford at least basic services. Still,
many of the casino's 1,200 employees, even those who come from East
St. Louis, live elsewhere, where the schools are better and there
are neighborhoods where houses appreciate in value.
</P>
<P>
   For the very poor in East St. Louis, prone to not voting or
participating in civic life, the city still looks very bleak.
Andrea Mitchell, a 20-year-old mother of six, moved to East St.
Louis from Washington Park, Ill., less than two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   With local schools too overcrowded to accept her 5-year-old and
4-year-old, Mitchell said she was about ready to move again. She
lives in the Normandy Houses, a barrackslike public housing
complex, and despite help from neighbors, she can not manage her
young family in her two-bedroom apartment and police her
neighborhood as well.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``All these empty lots and empty houses are terrible,'' Mitchell
said. ``The streets need to be fixed. There really ain't no
businesses here. People should all pitch in and clean this place
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the president's visit, a Blockbuster video store and
Save-A-Lot grocery store that were already in the works have opened
by the Walgreen's, creating a small but bona fide shopping center
in the heart of town. They represent the first major retail
development in the city since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   But with so much abandonment, and such seemingly intractable
poverty, longtime residents and business owners say it will take
more than a few new chain stores to lift the city off its knees.
</P>
<P>
   Fredericka Nash and her two sisters run the Nash Funeral Home,
which their parents opened more than 70 years ago. Nash, 80,
remembers when East St. Louis was ``a bustling city.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To look around, you certainly wouldn't see it,'' Nash said.
``Sometimes, it looks like a battle zone. The people want better.
But how are you going to achieve that?''
</P>
<P>
   Like others, she brushed off the possibility of a federal
solution. ``With the proper city administration,'' she said
sternly, ``possibly it may be able to stem the tide.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, Debra Powell, did not keep a scheduled appointment to
talk about her city and was busy the next day as well. Her
assistant said Powell was too busy planning to meet the actors
Harry Belafonte and Danny Glover, who were considering investing in
the city.
</P>
<P>
   APPALACHIA: ANGER AT BEING PART OF POVERTY TOUR
</P>
<P>
   Of all the jobs in Jackson County, Ky., those on the assembly
line at the Mid-South Electronics Co. in Annville are among the
most coveted.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-South, a contract manufacturer for several multinational
companies, has nearly 900 employees, up from 40 workers 10 years
ago. And the nonunion shop keeps hiring more workers, while few
leave. Employees say the pay, which starts at $5.75 an hour, is
pretty good, especially considering medical benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Dunn, who has worked at Mid-South for 7 years, after 11
years at a textile plant in London, a town 22 miles away, considers
himself lucky. ``I'd say it's one of the better jobs around,'' said
Dunn, 50, the single father of two boys.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stopped at Mid-South on his poverty tour to prove his
point that companies can park themselves anywhere and do well.
</P>
<P>
   Folks at Mid-South say it was a big thrill to have the president
walk through the plant, even though many workers are Republicans
through and through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for him, but I'd better not say that too loud,'' said
Dunn, as he sat on a picnic table outside the plant on his lunch
break. About a dozen co-workers sat at the table next to him.
</P>
<P>
   Della Dell, a quality control supervisor who has been at
Mid-South for 16 years, said she was excited to meet the president,
even though she is a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stopped in here because he cared about jobs,'' Dell said,
``even if we were doing fine already.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of that kind of talk in Eastern Kentucky. People
are weary of the image of Appalachian hillbillies in miners' hats
and rope belts. Time and again they said it would be wrong to take
pictures or interview the rural poor without including the rest of
the people. Some were insulted that the president's visit was part
of a ``poverty tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, nearly 35 percent of the people in Jackson County, which
includes Annville, live below the poverty line, as do 30 percent of
those in Perry County, where the president addressed a rally in
Hazard. But as poor as the region is, the emphasis is on telling
the world that encouraging private investment is the way to go.
</P>
<P>
   This is God's country. From Annville to Hazard, people grow
patches of tobacco in the backyard and post the Ten Commandments on
their lawns. Signs on lampposts read: ``God is coming soon. Are you
ready?'' There seem to be as many churches as houses on the road,
most of them Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   People time and again said they were blessed to live in a place
as beautiful as Kentucky, where the mountains are green and lush
and the trees look as old as time.
</P>
<P>
   William Gorman, the mayor of Hazard (as in the old television
show, ``The Dukes of Hazard,'' which he never liked), invited the
president to visit his town months earlier, largely to show how
well Appalachia is doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Republican, and I really think he did us a great
honor,'' said Gorman, who traces his family's roots in the region
to the Revolutionary War. ``The greatest problem I've seen with
people is the lack of hope. You give them hope and they'll conquer
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton talked about his ``new markets initiative,'' to entice
businesses to invest here, but for Gorman, who has been mayor for
23 years, Hazard (population 5,416) is already benefiting from the
new economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Appalachia has a lot of problems,'' he said, taking the time
on a Saturday with his assistant and friend of 50 years, Charlie
Hammonds, to give reporters a tour of the town. All traffic pointed
to the Wal-Mart, and the grand opening of a new off-track betting
center, the U-Bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the quality of life here is no different than it is
anywhere in the country,'' Hammonds piped in. ``We're just the same
as most places.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammonds was worried that the president spent a little too much
time in places where the old stereotype of Appalachia persists _ on
rural roads, out where families have little education or work.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact remains that very poor people still live along the
back roads of Appalachia, in houses that look like abandoned barns.
Some of them even live right on the roads for all the world to see.
</P>
<P>
   Take Jesse McWhorter and his family, who live off a county road
in Burning Springs, up the road from Annville (population about
500).
</P>
<P>
   Jesse, 15, lives with his mother and two sisters, 11 and 8, in a
house with so many dogs and puppies and cats and kittens that no
one can say exactly how many they own.
</P>
<P>
   He owns cocks, too, beautiful bantam roosters that he has spared
from death despite his belief, once he was born again last year,
that raising cocks is the devil's business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept two cocks because they're so beautiful,'' Jesse said.
``The other ones I just took and went like this,'' he said,
twisting his hands to show how he snapped their necks.
</P>
<P>
   When the school van dropped him off the other day, his mother,
Linda, was on the porch with his youngest sister, Chrissie, home
from school because she did not feel like going. An old friend,
Martha Couch, was on the porch, too.
</P>
<P>
   McWhorter and Couch vaguely remember the president's visit,
though they say they do not vote or pay much attention to politics.
</P>
<P>
   Couch, who recently learned from a social worker that she was 75
years old _ ``I thought I was 72'' _ said that there were not many
people like her and the McWhorters left, families who have lived in
the area for generations, growing tobacco or mining, minding no
one's businesses but their own.
</P>
<P>
   But Jesse, chewing tobacco and spitting it, awkwardly, said he
was going to live a different life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to start making some money,'' he said. ``I can
drive a truck. Or I can make pizzas.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was not even thinking of college. ``I can't afford
it,'' he said, dismissing the notion of scholarships or loans. ``I
can afford to find my own way, though. I can definitely afford
that.''

<P>
   CLARKSDALE, Miss. _ In Eastern Kentucky, a 15-year-old boy
dreams of quitting school to make real money working at a pizza
parlor. Here in Clarksdale, a 68-year-old widow thanks God that she
can manage the $200-a-month rent on a house one good rain could
wash away. In East St. Louis, Ill., a 20-year-old mother of six
wishes she could find a public housing project where the broken
glass on the stoop is swept away.
</P>
<P>
   Poor people learn to keep hopes small. So when President Clinton
came calling on some of the poorest places in the country last year
with ideas to make things better, it was like rain in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   The president's six-state, four-day poverty tour, highlighting
for the first time in his two terms the places that remain
untouched by the longest economic boom in this nation's history,
caused an excitement that bordered on the spiritual. He was like a
charismatic preacher, stirring the congregation to believe.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the president's modest proposals for tax
incentives to bring businesses to impoverished communities are
still awaiting Senate approval. The idea that anything big might
happen to places that have been down longer than they were ever up
has long faded. And so is the notion, if it ever existed, that the
federal government is the answer to the empty downtowns, idle
laborers and the dilapidated buildings all too common in these
communities.
</P>
<P>
   In a presidential election season, when the two main candidates
are suggesting that everyone should benefit from the nation's
prosperity, the people who might be buoyed by the words have little
use for national politics. In dozens of interviews in communities
the president visited _ Clarksdale, East St. Louis and the Eastern
Kentucky towns of Hazard and Annville _ what was clear was that
Democrats are Democrats, Republicans are Republicans and people are
more concerned with how to fix their own communities than in the
state of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the extensive attention given Robert F. Kennedy's tour of
poor communities as a presidential candidate in 1968, Clinton's
tour was a day's headlines. And perhaps because this is the age of
welfare changes, the places Clinton visited expected little beyond
the visit. East St. Louis, which looks left over from a bombing, is
bent on proving that it is not the urban war zone it became known
as a decade ago. Appalachia, which is humming along, in parts, is
concerned with telling the world that it is not a haven for
barefooted hillbillies in shotgun shacks.
</P>
<P>
   CLARKSDALE: Facing Adversity, Showing Resilience
</P>
<P>
   Clarksdale, in the heart of the Mississippi Delta, is determined
to prove that with grit, it will not only endure, but prevail.
</P>
<P>
   It is, as the mayor says, ``resilient in the face of
adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   The morning of the day the president came to town, Sheila Fair
opened Ooo So Pretty flowers and gifts at the regular time, 9 a.m.
Fair nodded to the Secret Service agents on the roof, said hey to
the ones who had been hanging around the store for 10 days and
managed to take a few orders for bouquets.
</P>
<P>
   Her store, on the corner of a nearly abandoned strip of downtown
Issaquena Street, had been chosen as the site of a meeting between
the president and local small-business owners. Word was that he was
bringing ways to lure businesses that fled to Route 61 back to
town, besides enticing new ones.
</P>
<P>
   But Fair, barely getting by after 21 years in business, would
bet on just two things that day. It would be hotter than heck, and
Clinton's visit would make great pictures.
</P>
<P>
   She was right. When Clinton strolled through the tired, broken
streets of downtown, sweating enough for two men in the 105-degree
heat, it was the most exciting thing to happen to Clarksdale
(population 22,000) in a long time. Maybe ever. He passed the
boarded Roxy Theater, the closed-down Pac-Man lounge and the
falling-down wooden houses as if he were right at home. Then he
came into Ooo So Pretty and listened to people sing the business
blues for about an hour, a lot longer than his schedulers had
planned.
</P>
<P>
   And then, he left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great Kodak moment,'' Fair said.
</P>
<P>
   As she expected, nothing has really changed on Issaquena Street.
Like so many downtown buildings abandoned for highway strips, the
Roxy (the mayor pointed it out to the president as a place that
might make a great cultural center with some kind of grant or loan)
is still boarded. The Pac-Man lounge is still closed. The falling
down houses look ready to give up completely.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Newson is still putting in the long hours at Newson's
Auto Parts, in a block-long building, inherited from his dad,
across the street from Ooo So Pretty. Newson opens at 7 and stays
until 7 or 8 to compete with the Wal-Mart and Auto Zone on Route
61. ``Right now,'' he said, ``it's just like the president never
came.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people say the same thing. Hardly anyone blames the
president, though. In Clarksdale, people pay as little attention to
Washington politics as Washington politics pays to them. No one
faults any of the presidential candidates for not coming around;
they are used to being ignored.
</P>
<P>
   They tend to blame Wal-Mart for their problems, for stealing
business from downtown. Or Memphis, 75 miles away, for stealing
brain power. Or the local politicians, for letting downtown slip
into a coma without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   They blame themselves, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``People got to want to improve,'' said Ethel Mae Clark, sitting
on her mother's porch on downtown Yazoo Street. Next door was a
boarded shack of a house. Across the street, where houses used to
be, was a lot overrun with weeds.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who lives nearby, has diabetes and a failing kidney, and
her world is framed by the $400 Social Security check she receives
each month. Her mother, Martha Riley, who sitting on the porch
sewing a quilt under a sign for ``Pigee's Beauty Salon'' _ a
remnant of her landlord's defunct business _ is in similar straits.
Riley pays $200 a month rent for the house and wishes she could
afford better. She blames not being able to read or write for her
lot. ``Here,'' she said, ``things just get worser.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clarksdale is a proud old place. Some of the biggest
names in the blues walked these streets. Muddy Waters and John Lee
Hooker grew up in town. Bessie Smith died here.
</P>
<P>
   The Delta Blues Museum, which is fighting for financing from the
Clarksdale Board of Commissioners, attracts visitors from all over
the world. Tony Czech, the director, showed off the guest book to
prove it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at these,'' Czech said, leafing through a few pages that
revealed addresses from Paris, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany and
Alaska. ``And these are just over a couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   But after these visitors tour the museum, they have nowhere else
in Clarksdale to go.
</P>
<P>
   In May, J.C. Penney closed its downtown store and replaced it
with a catalog store next door to a former pharmacy, which had
moved to Route 61.
</P>
<P>
   For the really poor people, shopping means taking a long walk
along a busy road. Local bus service is nonexistent. And in
Clarksdale, 40 percent of the residents have incomes below the
poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Webster Jr., the mayor, had hoped the president's visit
would lead to real change. But Webster is not surprised that it did
not. ``We Deltans have learned to be resilient,'' he said.
``Resilient in the face of adversity. Just the fact that we are
able to live and work here is a sign of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are occasional cries of desperation. Dave Williams, a
part-time carpenter, started calling out, ``Factories! Factories!''
when he saw a reporter and photographer walking around town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Factories,'' Williams shouted. ``We need some factories
here.''
</P>
<P>
   He has lived here all his life, 42 years, but cannot see
sticking it out much longer. ``I would like to have a full-time
job,'' Williams said. ``So would a lot of people. I know a friend
of mine, he's living in one of those cattle boxes that sit on the
tracks. So are a lot of people. See for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   On a scorching day, there was no one in the metal cars. Hardly
anyone walked the streets, either, except for a twig-skinny woman
who asked for $5 for a fix, and a man gathering cans in a plastic
grocery bag.

 &HT;    Bengals players ready to work for new coach
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ For better or worse, the Bengals are ready to go to
war for new head coach Dick LeBeau.
</P>
<P>
   That's something not all the players were willing to do for
Bruce Coslet, who resigned on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some players probably respected (Coslet). Some players
probably didn't,'' quarterback Akili Smith said. ``There are some
players on the team that probably don't respect each other. That's
just nature. Hopefully, we can build all that back up.''
</P>
<P>
   The players expressed shock, sadness and surprise at the sudden
change of leadership. They could sense a move was coming with the
team's fifth 0-3 start since 1991. They just didn't know when. It
came the day after a 37-0 loss at Baltimore on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A change had to happen,'' Smith said. ``It starts from the
top. Unfortunately, it was not all Bruce's fault. You feel sorry
for him because he's put a lot of effort into us getting better. We
didn't get it done. We're a young team and the burden fell on
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite complaining on numerous occasions about his lack of
carries in three previous seasons, tailback Corey Dillon said he's
``going to miss'' Coslet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been a good coach to me and I loved him as a
person,'' Dillon said. ``As a player, enough is enough. Something's
got to change and something's got to give. I didn't think it would
be Bruce. He's taking the burden for a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dillon attributed his brief verbal exchange with Coslet on the
sidelines in the second half of Sunday's game to frustration. He
was held to nine yards on 12 carries and has 82 yards rushing on 41
attempts this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A point came (Sunday) where I was tired and enough was enough,
and I was kind of frustrated with what was going on,'' Dillon said.
``I kind of let my emotions get the best of me, but it wasn't
anything personal toward Bruce. It was just how the whole day was
going. I was pretty upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret it. But at the same time, it was emotion. It was
football. Sometimes when your emotions take over, you do things you
wish you didn't do. I just came out and went back in and got myself
together and continued to play ball. I always respected him. At
times, I get frustrated. I've got to control what's going on with
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Added right offensive tackle Willie Anderson: ``A man just lost
his job. Losing your job is nothing to be rejoicing over. We all
feel bad for Bruce. Each guy should feel personally responsible for
what happened to the man. It was hard on the man for his health. It
was hard on him mentally and not being able to sleep at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still going to be on the players to execute no matter who
the head coach is. It's not going to be anything magical.''
</P>
<P>
   Left offensive tackle John Jackson said the team's initial shock
came from sadness.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we'll get over it because we understand this is a business
and we have to move on,'' he said. ``I think they made a wise
decision with Dick LeBeau, and I think we can do some pretty good
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will follow Dick LeBeau anywhere, especially into war.
That's what the NFL is on Sunday. It's a war.''

 &HT;    LeBeau tries to stay focused amid storm
 &HT;    By Marty Williams
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Dick LeBeau stood at ground zero and tried to
ignore the desolation that surrounded him.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 8 a.m. on Monday, LeBeau learned he was the new
head coach of the winless Cincinnati Bengals. LeBeau replaces Bruce
Coslet, who resigned in the aftermath of Sunday's embarrassing 37-0
loss in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our task as a coaching staff is to get the team back on the
right course and that's a course that's on the rise,'' said the
63-year-old LeBeau, whose previous title was assistant head coach
and defensive coordinator. ``We think we have quality young players
here and we think we can do that. We think we can win and win on a
regular basis with these people.''
</P>
<P>
   It has, of course, been a long time since the Bengals were on a
positive course. They were 52-108 during the 1990s and are 0-3 this
season, including back-to-back shutouts in Jacksonville and
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Club insiders said team president Mike Brown first offered the
job to linebacker coach Mark Duffner, the only Coslet assistant
with head coaching experience. But Duffner, who guided Holy Cross
and Maryland for a total of 11 seasons, apparently turned him down
in deference to LeBeau, who has spent 42 years in the NFL as a
player and coach.
</P>
<P>
   Brown declined to answer any questions about Duffner, who was
not available to the media because the coaches were preparing for
Sunday's game with Miami at Paul Brown Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Brown praised LeBeau for his ability to ``relate to players.
He's a good teacher. He knows how to present his ideas and he has a
lot of ideas to present. I think he can step in now and take our
situation and get it back on course as quickly as anybody could.''
</P>
<P>
   LeBeau promised some changes for a team that has been outscored
74-7 and has gone 10 quarters without scoring, but said he wasn't
ready to spell out what those changes will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think performance is a problem right now,'' LeBeau said.
``We have to address everything we're doing. There's a reason why
we're not performing up to our capabilities. We have to find that
reason and resolve it.''
</P>
<P>
   The search for answers will be difficult because there are so
many questions. When asked what areas needed improvement, LeBeau
indicted everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to stop people (on defense) with more consistency,''
he said. ``We have to score more points. And our kicking game has
to be more consistent. So you're talking about all areas of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   LeBeau met with the players shortly before his promotion, then
gave them the rest of the day off. He said his message was brief
and to the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them to meet with their position coaches, to be
introspective momentarily, to look at themselves and to come in
Wednesday (when on-field preparations for Miami begin) ready to get
this thing going in the right direction,'' LeBeau said.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the coaching staff will remain intact, although
there will be some changes in duties. Duffner will play an
increased role in preparing the defense and Ken Anderson will
direct the offense and call the plays. Anderson was listed as
Coslet's offensive coordinator, but Coslet retained most of the
play-calling responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   LeBeau has had two tours of duty as a Bengals assistant, first
under Forrest Gregg and Sam Wyche and then under Coslet, and
coached in both of Cincinnati's Super Bowl appearances. In between
the Bengal stints, he spent five years in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   He was Wyche's defensive coordinator for three seasons and the
Bengals ranked 26th, 16th and 15th in the NFL. Since 1997, the
rankings have been 28th, 28th, 25th and the current 19th.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he realized the coaching change will not send a
welcome message to fans who have been alienated by the team's
well-documented failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Winning) is the only message that really matters,'' he said.
``I think this (change) will help us win on the field and if we do,
the fans will respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown did not attach the word ``interim'' to LeBeau's new title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick is the head coach and as head coach, he's no different
than any other head coach,'' Brown said. ``It's a bottom-line
business. If we do well (over the next 13 games), he would stay the
head coach well into the future.''

   ``All these empty lots and empty houses are terrible,'' Mitchell
said. ``The streets need to be fixed. There really ain't no
businesses here. People should all pitch in and clean this place
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the president's visit, a Blockbuster video store and
Save-A-Lot grocery store that were already in the works have opened
by the Walgreen's, creating a small but bona fide shopping center
in the heart of town. They represent the first major retail
development in the city since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   But with so much abandonment, and such seemingly intractable
poverty, longtime residents and business owners say it will take
more than a few new chain stores to lift the city off its knees.
</P>
<P>
   Fredericka Nash and her two sisters run the Nash Funeral Home,
which their parents opened more than 70 years ago. Nash, 80,
remembers when East St. Louis was ``a bustling city.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To look around, you certainly wouldn't see it,'' Nash said.
``Sometimes, it looks like a battle zone. The people want better.
But how are you going to achieve that?''
</P>
<P>
   Like others, she brushed off the possibility of a federal
solution. ``With the proper city administration,'' she said
sternly, ``possibly it may be able to stem the tide.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, Debra Powell, did not keep a scheduled appointment to
talk about her city and was busy the next day as well. Her
assistant said Powell was too busy planning to meet the actors
Harry Belafonte and Danny Glover, who were considering investing in
the city.

<P>
   APPALACHIA: Anger at Being Part of Poverty Tour
</P>
<P>
   Of all the jobs in Jackson County, Ky., those on the assembly
line at the Mid-South Electronics Co. in Annville are among the
most coveted.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-South, a contract manufacturer for several multinational
companies, has nearly 900 employees, up from 40 workers 10 years
ago. And the nonunion shop keeps hiring more workers, while few
leave. Employees say the pay, which starts at $5.75 an hour, is
pretty good, especially considering medical benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Dunn, who has worked at Mid-South for 7 years, after 11
years at a textile plant in London, a town 22 miles away, considers
himself lucky. ``I'd say it's one of the better jobs around,'' said
Dunn, 50, the single father of two boys.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stopped at Mid-South on his poverty tour to prove his
point that companies can park themselves anywhere and do well.
</P>
<P>
   Folks at Mid-South say it was a big thrill to have the president
walk through the plant, even though many workers are Republicans
through and through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for him, but I'd better not say that too loud,'' said
Dunn, as he sat on a picnic table outside the plant on his lunch
break. About a dozen co-workers sat at the table next to him.
</P>
<P>
   Della Dell, a quality control supervisor who has been at
Mid-South for 16 years, said she was excited to meet the president,
even though she is a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stopped in here because he cared about jobs,'' Dell said,
``even if we were doing fine already.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of that kind of talk in Eastern Kentucky. People
are weary of the image of Appalachian hillbillies in miners' hats
and rope belts. Time and again they said it would be wrong to take
pictures or interview the rural poor without including the rest of
the people. Some were insulted that the president's visit was part
of a ``poverty tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, nearly 35 percent of the people in Jackson County, which
includes Annville, live below the poverty line, as do 30 percent of
those in Perry County, where the president addressed a rally in
Hazard. But as poor as the region is, the emphasis is on telling
the world that encouraging private investment is the way to go.
</P>
<P>
   This is God's country. From Annville to Hazard, people grow
patches of tobacco in the backyard and post the Ten Commandments on
their lawns. Signs on lampposts read: ``God is coming soon. Are you
ready?'' There seem to be as many churches as houses on the road,
most of them Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   People time and again said they were blessed to live in a place
as beautiful as Kentucky, where the mountains are green and lush
and the trees look as old as time.
</P>
<P>
   William Gorman, the mayor of Hazard (as in the old television
show, ``The Dukes of Hazard,'' which he never liked), invited the
president to visit his town months earlier, largely to show how
well Appalachia is doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Republican, and I really think he did us a great
honor,'' said Gorman, who traces his family's roots in the region
to the Revolutionary War. ``The greatest problem I've seen with
people is the lack of hope. You give them hope and they'll conquer
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton talked about his ``new markets initiative,'' to entice
businesses to invest here, but for Gorman, who has been mayor for
23 years, Hazard (population 5,416) is already benefiting from the
new economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Appalachia has a lot of problems,'' he said, taking the time
on a Saturday with his assistant and friend of 50 years, Charlie
Hammonds, to give reporters a tour of the town. All traffic pointed
to the Wal-Mart, and the grand opening of a new off-track betting
center, the U-Bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the quality of life here is no different than it is
anywhere in the country,'' Hammonds piped in. ``We're just the same
as most places.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammonds was worried that the president spent a little too much
time in places where the old stereotype of Appalachia persists _ on
rural roads, out where families have little education or work.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact remains that very poor people still live along the
back roads of Appalachia, in houses that look like abandoned barns.
Some of them even live right on the roads for all the world to see.
</P>
<P>
   Take Jesse McWhorter and his family, who live off a county road
in Burning Springs, up the road from Annville (population about
500).
</P>
<P>
   Jesse, 15, lives with his mother and two sisters, 11 and 8, in a
house with so many dogs and puppies and cats and kittens that no
one can say exactly how many they own.
</P>
<P>
   He owns cocks, too, beautiful bantam roosters that he has spared
from death despite his belief, once he was born again last year,
that raising cocks is the devil's business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept two cocks because they're so beautiful,'' Jesse said.
``The other ones I just took and went like this,'' he said,
twisting his hands to show how he snapped their necks.
</P>
<P>
   When the school van dropped him off the other day, his mother,
Linda, was on the porch with his youngest sister, Chrissie, home
from school because she did not feel like going. An old friend,
Martha Couch, was on the porch, too.
</P>
<P>
   McWhorter and Couch vaguely remember the president's visit,
though they say they do not vote or pay much attention to politics.
</P>
<P>
   Couch, who recently learned from a social worker that she was 75
years old _ ``I thought I was 72'' _ said that there were not many
people like her and the McWhorters left, families who have lived in
the area for generations, growing tobacco or mining, minding no
one's businesses but their own.
</P>
<P>
   But Jesse, chewing tobacco and spitting it, awkwardly, said he
was going to live a different life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to start making some money,'' he said. ``I can
drive a truck. Or I can make pizzas.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was not even thinking of college. ``I can't afford
it,'' he said, dismissing the notion of scholarships or loans. ``I
can afford to find my own way, though. I can definitely afford
that.''

SENATE APPROVES $7.8-BILLION PLAN TO RESTORE EVERGLADES 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate voted overwhelmingly on Monday to
approve a $7.8-billion plan intended to restore the Everglades and
its ecosystem, a project supporters say is the most ambitious
environmental restoration effort ever.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, drafted by the Army Corps of Engineers, would revamp
South Florida's water supply by capturing and storing more rain
water, then redirecting its flow into the Everglades. It comes
after years of delicate negotiations between the Clinton
administration, the state of Florida, Congress and an unlikely
coalition of environmentalists, sugar growers, utility companies,
home builders and the Indian tribes that live on the land.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare bipartisan twist, the project also made allies of Vice
President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, Gov. George
W. Bush, his Republican challenger, and Bush's younger brother Jeb,
the Republican governor of Florida. All three men support the plan,
in which Gore took an active interest early on and which Gov. Jeb
Bush helped to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Having the fourth largest number of electoral votes, Florida is
likely to play a role in the November election and Gov. George W.
Bush and Gore are engaged in a fierce contest to win over voters
there.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the plan, which is attached to a larger bill
on water resources, by a vote of 85-1. Now, attention turns to the
House, where the measure is tangled in unrelated partisan disputes.
So far, the House has not scheduled a vote on the bill, but Florida
Republicans said on Monday that they would pursue several different
strategies to try to pass the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's truly bipartisan, it's truly historic'' said Sen. Robert
C. Smith of New Hampshire, the Republican chairman of the Committee
on the Environment and Public Works, about the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a national treasure; it is a vast freshwater marsh,
which once was connected by the flow of water, a sheet of water, a
river of water, flowing south from Lake Okeechobee all the way into
the Gulf of Mexico,'' he said. ``But now the Everglades is in
peril; it is half the size it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   By redirecting the flow of water into the Everglades, which
includes Everglades National Park, the legislation aims to
resuscitate the 12 million acres of sawgrass and swamp that cut
across southern Florida and revitalize its dying plants and
animals. As many as 68 plant and animal species in the Everglades
are fighting off extinction.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, backers of the plan say it would ensure an
adequate supply of fresh water for South Florida cities and farms,
a major concern to local governments, Florida utilities, the sugar
industry and citrus farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The bill calls for the federal government to split the cost of
the $7.8 billion project with the state of Florida, a tacit
recognition of the federal government's role in damaging the
Everglades. In 1948, facing severe flooding in South Florida,
Congress ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to reroute the flow of
water there.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Corps built a series of levees and canals that
changed the natural flow of water into the Everglades and shunted
1.7 billion gallons of fresh water into the ocean every day. The
Everglades wound up receiving too little water during the dry
season and too much during the rainy season.
</P>
<P>
   While the work made the east coast of the state safe for
development and permitted the lucrative sugar industry to flourish,
it also drained the Everglades of fresh water and nearly killed it.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new project is expected to take 30 to 40 years to
complete, the bill would establish the Army Corps' plan as the
framework for the restoration. The plan was first submitted two
years ago. The bill would also authorize the first $1.1 billion for
10 of the 68 projects in the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the largest, most complex environmental restoration
project, not only in the history of the United States of America,
but in the history of the world,'' said Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla.,
who worked closely with his Republican colleague, Sen. Connie Mack,
in support of the program.
</P>
<P>
   To keep track of the costs, which a few senators viewed as
exorbitant, the legislation states that no individual project can
go 20 percent over budget without an explanation to Congress. And
it instructs the Corps of Engineers to come back to Congress
periodically for more money.
</P>
<P>
   Most environmental groups signed on to the project early,
although a few question whether so complicated and untested a plan
is truly necessary. The Corps of Engineers, they say, must be
closely watched as it carries out such a complex project over such
an extended period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The details, design and operation phases are things that will
need monitoring constantly,'' said Stuart Strahl, president and
chief executive officer of Audubon Florida. ``But this is a huge
step.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups have also raised concerns about a proposal
to convert the former Homestead Air Reserve base, which was
demolished by Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and sits near the
Everglades, into a commercial airport. Environmental impact studies
say the noise and pollution generated by an airport could cause
further harm to the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the criticism, the Senate included in the bill
nonbinding language, drafted by Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio,
urging that the redevelopment of the former base be consistent with
the restoration of the Everglades. The bill also requests that the
federal government issue a report to Congress in two years on the
base's redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   The Corps of Engineers' long-term plan to restore the Everglades
would require capturing fresh water and storing it in limestone
quarries and acquifers, methods that are untested in that area.
Engineers would also remove dikes and barriers at the eastern edge
of the Everglades, which abuts with urban Miami, to permit the
water to flow into the marshland.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of the captured water would be used to restore
the ecosystem, giving the Everglades half the total expanded water
supply. Currently, farms and cities get 70 percent of a smaller
water supply.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the work begun by the Corps of Engineers in the
late 1940s, Elliot Diringer, the White House deputy press
secretary, called the new plan ``a replumbing of the replumbing.''

GORE TAKES HIS MEDICARE PROPOSALS TO AGING FLORIDA VOTERS
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORAL GABLES, Fla. _ Campaigning in Florida, where nearly 40
percent of the voters may be 60 or older, Vice President Al Gore
pledged Monday to strengthen sanctions against health maintenance
organizations that pull out of the Medicare market, and to
eliminate Medicare co-payments and deductibles for a variety of
preventative tests.
</P>
<P>
   Gore unveiled those proposals in a speech in St. Petersburg that
opened a weeklong discussion of Medicare policy. Before flying here
to attend several fund-raisers, Gore used his speech to convey his
differences on the issue with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Gore
drew attention to a five-year-old interview in which Bush expressed
support for the deep Medicare cuts championed by former House
Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides provided reporters with a videotape of the Oct. 19,
1995, interview by an Austin, Texas, television station in which
Bush commended that year's House Republican plan to cut $270
billion over seven years from Medicare. The proposal died after a
prolonged budget battle with congressional Democrats and the White
House that prompted two government shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elderly people will not suffer as a result of this plan,''
Bush said in the interview with KXAN. ``It's going to make the plan
solvent. And Republicans will be heralded, not only for saving
Medicare, but at the same time for having the political courage to
balance the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides then made him available for an interview with The
New York Times, in which he said Bush's comments were ``very
revealing of his basic attitude toward Medicare'' and belied his
claim to being a new kind of Republican. ``He doesn't like it,''
Gore said. ``He disagrees with its basic premise, and he is looking
for any politically viable opportunity to gut it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Bush, said Bush had made it clear
with his 10-year plan to restructure Medicare, at a cost of $198
billion, that he is committed to the program. Bartlett said, ``What
is important here is not what Governor Bush said about a plan five
years ago that wasn't even his. What's important is what he says
about his plan today.''

   WASHINGTON _ When Vice President Al Gore isn't quite sure about
some obscure detail of his health care plan, he will end his
remarks with a fleeting, almost unnoticed question: ``Isn't that
right, Sarah?''
</P>
<P>
   A quick nod, a thumbs-up or a clenched fist in the air from the
fidgety young woman who always seems to be nearby means the
Democratic presidential nominee has nailed it. A few words of
clarification or some additional details means he was close _ but
not close enough for Sarah.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Bianchi, a 27-year-old Atlanta native, is deputy domestic
affairs adviser to the Gore campaign. But the title understates the
way Gore has come to depend on her.
</P>
<P>
   By the vice president's assessment, Bianchi is ``scary smart'' _
a walking, talking encyclopedia of the way he intends to run
federal health care programs if he is elected president this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``Medicare at the Crossroads,'' the 74-page booklet Gore
released at a St. Petersburg, Fla., campaign event Monday, was
largely produced by Bianchi this past weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But that booklet was just one item on her ``to do'' list before
heading back out on the campaign trail this week.
</P>
<P>
   She also briefed Gore campaign surrogates about the details of
the vice president's Medicare plan. And, at least as important
strategically, she helped pull together the information needed to
criticize competing proposals from Gore's rival, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Scary smart?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just scary,'' said Bianchi, with a quick laugh that punctuates
much of a conversation with her. It is an easy, natural laugh, not
at all in keeping with her constant fidgeting, a condition not
uncommon among the sleepless twenty-somethings on presidential
campaigns who are fueled by too many candy bars and Diet Cokes.
</P>
<P>
   The quick nod, the thumbs up, the clenched fist _ they are not
just signals to Gore. They are Bianchi's way of talking about
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my mania,'' she said. ``The vice president knows his
stuff. It's just incredible to me how much detail he knows, about
so many things. I'm just there if he has a question.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, she resembles a cheerleader, nearly jumping in the air
when the vice president responds exceptionally well to a question
at a town hall meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all exciting,'' she explained. ``I know that at some
point, I probably need to get a little more balance in my life. But
this is an unbelievable experience. And it's an honor to work on
issues that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Bianchi's interest in health care policy stems from her
childhood in Atlanta. She often accompanied her mother, Barbara, a
developmental psychologist, on visits to Henry W. Grady Hospital,
where she worked with children on Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Her interest in public service is rooted in the Paideia School.
The progressive private school was founded by children of the
1960s, including her father, Paul, the school's only headmaster, a
Boston native inspired by John F. Kennedy's call to service.
</P>
<P>
   The school made her ``very idealistic,'' she said. When she
wasn't playing basketball for the school team, she was tutoring
low-income children or coaching youth soccer and basketball teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really great growing up in the school community,''
Bianchi said. ``Sometimes I didn't like the idea of my father being
right around the Coke machine at school. But most of the kids
really liked him. And I only had one occasion where my date wanted
to drop me off a few blocks away from the house. He said he didn't
want to get any closer.''
</P>
<P>
   From Paideia, Bianchi went to Harvard University, where she
became friends with Karenna Gore, the vice president's eldest
child. Bianchi spent time enough time with the Gore family that she
became known as ``Sarah B.'' to distinguish her from Sara Gore, one
of Karenna's two sisters.
</P>
<P>
   A standout basketball player _ she once was Georgia High School
Player of the Month _ Bianchi has occasionally shot baskets with
the vice president. And proving that she has learned a lot about
politics, she insists that the vice president always won. ``That's
the right answer,'' she said with that quick laugh of hers.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But, ironically, it was Bill Clinton, not Al Gore, who
originally inspired Bianchi _ or rather, the Kennedyesque call to
service that Clinton incorporated into his campaign for the
presidency in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was telling young people that they could make a
difference,'' she said of Clinton. ``And for the first time in my
life, someone at the national level was talking about things that
resonated with me and with my life.''
</P>
<P>
   After Harvard, then, she became a White House intern. It was
1995, the government was being shut down, and like some many other
volunteers, she was thrown into tasks that she would otherwise
never had a chance to take on.
</P>
<P>
   Her talents were quickly recognized, and when a job came open in
the health care section of the White House Office of Management and
Budget, she was the first choice.
</P>
<P>
   She moved from OMB to the office of Bruce Reed, the director of
the president's Domestic Policy Council, again working on health
care. And in 1998, she moved to the vice president's office,
becoming his chief adviser on health care, eventually shifting over
to the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Klain, Gore's former chief of staff, hired Bianchi
without knowing her personal connections to the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me I could get in on the ground floor,'' she said,
noting the irony.
</P>
<P>
   Bianchi is quick to express the hurt and frustration she felt
over Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a White House
intern at the same time as Bianchi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough and, of course, disappointing,'' she said. ``But
now I find myself hoping that at the end of the day the country
will remember the good things about him, because I do believe he
accomplished a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   But being at the White House during Clinton's impeachment ``also
was a good lesson of staying focused and keeping positive things
coming out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lesson that has guided her through the bleakest times of
the Gore presidential campaign as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned a lot watching the vice president keep going,''
Bianchi said. ``There are a lot of ups and downs and there are a
lot of fair-weather friends in politics. But it's a four-quarter
game, and you've got to stick with your team when they are down.
And you just keep going, if you think you're right on the issues.''

DODGERS COACHES UNCERTAIN, TOO

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Davey Johnson could have six games remaining in
his Dodgers managerial career, and his tenuous status also puts a
strain on many in the organization, including the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The constant scrutiny of Johnson affects his staff -- bench
coach Jim Tracy, batting coach Rick Down, third-base coach Glenn
Hoffman, first-base coach John Shelby, pitching coach Claude Osteen
and bullpen coach Rick Dempsey -- in some manner.
</P>
<P>
   Their futures are closely tied to Johnson's fate, though team
officials said some of the coaches could remain even if Johnson
doesn't return. In fact, Down, Tracy and Hoffman could all be
involved in the managerial search if Johnson is fired, baseball
officials said. However, the Dodgers brass might not want to take a
chance with a young, inexperienced manager.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, while Johnson has lived through the months of
speculation and reports about his job status, so, too, have his
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all think about it, no question,'' Tracy said. ``It's the
idea about the uncertainty that's involved, but as a group of
coaches, it hasn't affected one of us from continuing to do our job
as professionally as we could possible do it. It cannot affect you
when you go out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The on-field staff has been together since former pitching coach
Charlie Hough was fired in May of the 1999 season. He was replaced
by Osteen. During the winter, Johnson fought hard to keep Osteen on
staff while the front office contemplated another direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really been difficult,'' Tracy said of the situation.
``I can't speak on behalf of the other coaches, but it's something
when you put your name on that (contract), you're very aware of the
fact that it's part of what comes with the territory. It comes with
it. I think the most important fact is you have to know in your
mind what's within the realm of your job description, that you're
responsible to do that job as well as you can do it. That's what
you can control.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Park honored: Chan Ho Park was named National League pitcher
of the week after going 2-0 and not allowing a run. Park twice won
1-0 games in which he pitched eight innings. He allowed eight hits
and struck out 23 in 16 innings.
</P>
<P>
   A strong second half of the season for Park, which he's done
routinely in his career, has thrust him into position for a huge
contract if the Dodgers and his agent, Scott Boras, can reach an
agreement during the offseason. Park is 17-10 with a 3.40 ERA and
he's 8-4 with a 2.44 ERA since the All-Star break. Also, Park has
97 strikeouts in 96 innings since the break.
</P>
<P>
   Park is making a base salary of $3.85 million and will earn an
additional $400,000 in incentives, and he isn't eligible for free
agency until after the 2001 season. The Dodgers and Park are both
interested in signing a contract extension. But it's likely talk of
such a deal won't take place until January, after much of the
free-agent market is settled. Park could average $10 million a year
for his deal.
</P>
<P>
   -- Odds and ends: Utility player Jim Leyritz will have surgery
Wednesday in Florida to repair a small tear in his right rotator
cuff.... Right-hander Ismael Valdes will undergo tests today to
make sure he has no problem with his right pinkie. He was forced to
miss a start this month because of numbness in the finger and
hasn't pitched since.

 &HT;    Cowboys want to fix a leaky defense
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas - With the exception of George Teague's blindside
attack on 49ers' receiver Terrell Owens, defensive highlights for
the Dallas Cowboys were hard to find in Sunday's 41-24 loss to San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the defense has been the most disappointing unit
for the 1-3 Cowboys this month.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of blame to go around. Emmitt Smith has not had
a good game. The quarterback situation is confusing. The offensive
line has more leaks than they can fix. Yet Coach Dave Campo knows
where the real problem is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Number one, you're not going to win football games when you
give up 35 points,'' Campo said Monday. ``I don't care who's
playing quarterback or wide receiver. We have to fix our scoring
defense and it's my responsibility to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Cowboys are remarkably soft on defense. That's a
surprise to many, considering they have eight starters back from a
team that gave up 17.2 points a game last season.
</P>
<P>
   This year, it's 33.7.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have given up 40 points on consecutive home games
for the first time in 40 years. In their inaugural season the
Cowboys lost to Cleveland 48-7 and Baltimore 45-7 at the Cotton
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   It starts with the defensive line, which has four players with a
combined 30 seasons of NFL experience. Cornerbacks Phillippi Sparks
and rookie Kareem Larrimore have been lost since the opener. On
Monday Campo admitted that former middle linebacker Randall
Godfrey, now with Tennessee, is missed.
</P>
<P>
   The defense was exposed when Philadelphia's Duce Staley rushed
for 201 yards in the opener. San Francisco proved that was no fluke
when Charlie Garner rushed for 201 yards Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Don't blame that on Troy Aikman, Campo and several Cowboys said
after losing to the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A win is not going to come easy for us,'' team owner Jerry
Jones said. ``It's a series by series, quarter by quarter thing for
us. There are little things our offense needs to improve upon. I am
disappointed and surprised to be 1-3, but I'm not looking at any
dramatic personnel of philosophical changes. I believe in what
we're trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones declined to criticize Teague, who has tossed out of
Sunday's game for hitting Owens, who was about to taunt the Cowboys
-- for the second time -- on the painted star at midfield. Jones
said he was ``inspired'' by Teague's play.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys expect Teague will be fined by the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like people who fight for their territory,'' Campo said.
``Unfortunately, there is no place for that in the game. It
shouldn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens was suspended for one game by San Francisco coach Steve
Mariucci on Monday. The fine for missing one game for Owens is
$24,294.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Ebenezer Ekuban has a sprained right big toe and
will not be available for Sunday's game against Carolina. Players
who are questionable are defensive tackle Leon Lett (strained right
hamstring), wide receiver Rocket Ismail (sprained left ankle), and
receiver Wane McGarity (high left ankle sprain).
</P>
<P>
   Campo said he and San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci apologized
to each other for the taunting and fighting throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman downplayed speculation that the team was emotionally
drained after beating Washington 27-21 just six days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotion was a big part of the Redskins game, but we can't use
emotion as an excuse,'' Aikman said. ``We are played to come out
and play each week. If we weren't prepared (for San Francisco),
that's our fault.''

   For years, Thomas K. Brown threw verbal darts in a profession
known for cozy collegiality. A top-rated stock analyst, he
frequently blasted top bankers who were stringing together mergers
at prices he believed were too high.
</P>
<P>
   Brown so irritated Edward Crutchfield Jr., the former chief
executive of the First Union Corp. _ he once said Crutchfield
``never saw an acquisition proposal he didn't like'' _ that
Crutchfield dismissed the freckle-faced Brown as ``that little
red-haired boy.''
</P>
<P>
   And Brown even sent Hugh L. McColl Jr., who was gobbling up
companies as the chief executive of NationsBank, a business card
embossed with a quote from Warren E. Buffett about the ``egregious
imbalance'' of acquisitions, namely their usually negative impact
on the stock of the acquiring company. The flip side of the card
said simply, ``Compliments of Thomas K. Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   McColl, now chief executive of Bank of America, wrote back that
he found the note ``arrogant and insulting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not work for you, and don't plan to,'' McColl added.
``Please remove me from your mailing list.''
</P>
<P>
   No such luck. Though Brown, 41, has moved from one buttoned-down
profession to another, his bombs are still trained on McColl.
Earlier this year, he opened an investment firm, Second Curve
Capital, started a hedge fund for wealthy investors and began
posting his barbs on a Web site he created called Bankstocks.com.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the hedge fund industry is the most secretive and
private part of the investment world, Brown's Web site is an
unfettered forum for his sharp-edged analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it is kind, sometimes it cruel. Earlier this year,
Brown wrote a positive review of Bank One's hiring of James L.
Dimon, a former Citigroup executive, as its new chief. Brown
praised Dimon as ``right'' and said he was a charismatic outsider
who could address the company's internal divisions and who had the
backing of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's favorite target, however, remains McColl, a 65-year-old
take-charge ex-Marine from North Carolina who keeps a hand grenade
on his desk, but who is also known for his progressive streak,
including his extension of Bank of America health benefits to
same-sex partners.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has attacked McColl over last year's $48.5 million pay
package, and options on 1.4 million shares, compensation Brown
called ``truly nauseating'' since the company's stock was falling.
He even posted an invitation on the site to Bank of America's
outside directors, promising to ``travel to any location at any
time'' to explain why McColl and the firm's senior management
should be ousted.
</P>
<P>
   What does McColl think of all this? He declined to comment, but
Bank of America issued the following statement:
</P>
<P>
   ``While we respect the role of stock analysts in expressing
their opinion about a company's financial prospects, we are puzzled
by Brown's approach, which more nearly resembles personal attacks
than financial analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Brown's criticism of McColl is directed at his
acquisition strategies. As chief executive of NationsBank, McColl
was an aggressive buyer, purchasing BankSouth in 1995, Boatmen's
Bancshares in 1996 and Montgomery Securities in 1997. His
acquisitions culminated in 1998, when NationsBank merged with _ and
eventually took the name of _ Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has always confused size with winning,'' Brown wrote in a
commentary last week, entitled ``McColl's Latest Outrageous
Comments,'' that offered a point-by-point refutation of an
interview with McColl that appeared in U.S. Banker magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shareholders don't care about owning the biggest bank,'' he
added. ``They want to own shares in the banking company that is
going to provide them with the best risk-adjusted return on their
capital.''
</P>
<P>
   After falling 16.5 percent last year, Bank of America's stock
has rebounded with almost a 9.5 percent gain this year, through
Monday. But it lags the 12.3 percent return of the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange/KBW Bank index. Still, there are certainly analysts
who disagree with Brown's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been some concerns because McColl has done so many
mergers and he is thought of, along with Crutchfield, as one of the
two big serial acquirers of the industry,'' said James Ellman, a
Bank of America investor who manages the $80 million Merrill Lynch
Global Financial Services fund, and a $200 million offshore fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Nationsbank was a very good investment for a long time and
so was Bank of America for the last few years,'' he added. ``You've
got two management teams who have shown the ability to create
shareholder value.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown has also come up with an unusual analytical approach _ he
is inviting Bank of America employees, past and present, to write
to his Web site with ``what you believe are the best and worst
practices at the company.'' Bankstocks.com has received over 100
replies since posting the request in June, some from Bank of
America e-mail addresses, the firm said. It counts more than 1,000
unique visitors a day.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another e-mailer, identified as a shareholder and a former
executive of a competing bank, complained about the long lines at
Bank of America branches. A third e-mail, dealing with the
company's technology infrastructure, was from someone who said he
had recently left Bank of America for a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are way behind on core systems, despite having invested
heavily, and B of A was worse,'' the correspondent wrote. ``Now,
you put the two together, and voila, a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Can one believe the veracity of these any more than postings on
a message board? Bankstocks.com has no formal verification process,
but it has started dialogues with some of the executives and
employees who write in. Bankstocks.com also says the e-mail
messages it gets, because they are usually from people in the
industry, generally have a level of specificity one does not find
on a message board.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get stories,'' said Stephen D. Krug, chief operating
officer of Second Curve Capital and a former Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette junior analyst. ``They're not message board postings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like this is our only input,'' he added. ``We know
well enough what Bank of America is doing by talking to other banks
and financial institutions. When e-mails come in, we look at the
specifics they discuss, the names they use, the context.''
</P>
<P>
   In his new role as a money manager, of course, Brown is not
unbiased. He writes about companies in which his firm has a stake _
whether as a buyer of its stock or as a short-seller trying to
profit by betting a stock price will fall. Each commentary he
writes comes with a disclaimer to that effect. Brown's firm
declined to say whether it was long or short on Bank of America.
Certainly, his approach has raised eyebrows in the world of hedge
funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard anybody say they cared about what he thought,''
said one hedge fund manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``I just don't put any merit one way or the other on what he
says.''
</P>
<P>
   A money manager at a second hedge fund, also speaking on
condition of anonymity, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom's an excellent analyst, very opinionated,'' the manager
said of Bankstocks.com. ``Some people despise Tom, and other people
think he's sharp. In many cases, it's important to the stock and
its shareholders that someone is out there pointing out
management's missteps.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Colvin, chief operating officer of Tremont Advisors, a
hedge fund consulting firm, said Brown was likely to remain a
lonely voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be interesting in terms of publicity, but it's a
short-term gain potentially sacrificing long-term access,'' Colvin
said. ``Not only are you cutting yourself off from Bank of America
_ they'll never talk to you again _ but it also scares off other
management.''
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America said it would continue to grant Brown access to
the company. ``He has been an active participant in analyst calls
and we anticipate continuing to provide him access,'' the bank said
in its statement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is no surprise that relations are strained. Brown says
he now has freedom that he never had when he led a team of banking
analysts at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. Most Wall Street analysts
walk a tightrope between offering unvarnished opinions and being
careful not to rankle potential investment banking clients.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he was fired in 1998 because Donaldson ran out of
patience with his criticisms of large bank mergers, even though he
had been named the top regional bank analyst by Institutional
Investor magazine for eight of nine years. (A Donaldson spokesman
declined to comment on Brown's departure, citing the firm's policy
of not talking about former employees.)
</P>
<P>
   Brown does not see his Web site as a journalistic enterprise, in
the mold of TheStreet.com, the financial Web site co-founded by
James J. Cramer, another outspoken hedge fund manager. He sees it
as a research tool.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said his firm had spent no money to advertise and had no
intention of using the site as a commercial enterprise. Rather than
becoming a chat board for retail investors, he hoped Bankstocks.com
would become a forum for employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We brought up the site in January and didn't know what was
going to happen,'' he said. ``What we were surprised by is the
interactivity it creates. People want to talk. It creates a
different view of a company than people get today.''

SENATE PUSH TO TOUGHEN DRUNK-DRIVING STANDARD STALLS TRANSPORTATION
BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   By   STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A major fight has erupted in Congress over a
proposal to force states to adopt a more stringent standard for
drunk driving, under the threat of losing millions of dollars in
federal highway aid.
</P>
<P>
   The fight has held up agreement on a massive transportation
spending bill that provides money for highways and mass transit
systems and that also pays for air traffic controllers, the Coast
Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board, which
investigates air crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Under a provision of the Senate's $54.8-billion version of the
spending bill, people whose blood alcohol level is .08 percent _
meaning that eight-tenths of one percent of the liquid in their
blood stream is alcohol _ would be considered to be driving under
the influence. On average, a 170-pound man generally reaches that
blood-alcohol level by consuming five 12-ounce beers in two hours,
and a 120-pound woman by drinking three 12-ounce beers in that
time. The Senate bill, which was sponsored by Senator Frank R.
Lautenberg (D-N.J.) and passed in June, would require states to
adopt this standard within three years. If states decline to adopt
the standard, they would lose 5 percent of their Federal highway
funds the following year, another five per cent the next year and
10 per cent the year after that.
</P>
<P>
   Currently 18 states and the District of Columbia use the .08
percent criterion to define drunken driving, while 30 others set
their standard at the higher level of .10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Two states, Massachusetts and South Carolina, do not set a
specific blood-alcohol level for drunken driving but leave it up
the judgment of the arresting officer.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate negotiators are meeting this week to resolve
differences between the Senate bill and a $55.2-billion House
transportation measure that does not contain the .08 percent
blood-alcohol level requirement.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has drawn powerful antagonists in the restaurant
industry and provoked complaints from some states that the Federal
government should not be dictating requirements to them. Opponents
of the proposal cite evidence to argue that is not clear that
lowering the blood-alcohol level will save as many lives as its
proponents claim.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the last year in which complete statistics are
available, 38 percent of all traffic fatalities nationally involved
a driver who had been drinking. Of the 18 states and the District
of Columbia that have adopted the .08 percent standard, 9 had
alcohol-related fatalities greater than the national average, 8 had
alcohol-related fatalities that were below the national average and
two were at the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the tougher standard, including the Clinton
administration, argue that it will save 500 lives a year. They
point to studies that indicate that drivers exhibit significant
impairment, including slowed reflexes, at blood-alcohol levels even
lower than .08 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen at least eight studies dealing with impairment that
found that, on average, these laws have resulted in a 6 to 8
percent reduction in crashes,'' said Rodney Slater, the secretary
of transportation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Clinton administration, the law has drawn
support from groups like Mothers Against Drunk Driving &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried for over 10 years to have this standard adopted in
many states,'' said Millie Webb, National President of Mothers
Against Drunk Driving, whose 19-year-old nephew and 4-year-old
daughter were killed in 1971 by a driver whose blood-alcohol level
was .08 percent. ``That's why we have to have a federal mandate.
The general population knows you're too impaired at .08. But it's
the special interest that the legislators listen to, especially in
the committees.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is of great importance to groups like the Wholesale
Beer Distributors and the American Beverage Institute that
represents restaurants with liquor licenses. Of the more than
191,000 full service restaurants that provide table service, more
than 111,000 of them sell alcoholic drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists representing the restaurant industry say the new
mandate will force states to shift resources away from catching
people who are seriously drunk to concentrate on drivers who are
only mildly impaired.
</P>
<P>
   Also fighting the Senate provision are the National Governors
Association, the National League of Cities and groups representing
state legislatures who see the federal-mandated standard as a
states rights issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``States really don't like to be dictated to about what's the
most effective use of resources in their states,'' said Frank
Shafroth, Director of State-Federal Relations for the National
Governors Associations. ``They don't like to be told, here's the
money, but you can only spend it the way we think it ought to be
spent and not the way you and your citizens think.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress tried to pass a similar blood-alcohol limit two years
ago, but the proposal was beaten back by Rep. Bud Shuster (R-Pa.),
the chairman of the House Transportation Committee, who controls
billions of dollars in highway funds.

 &HT;    After another loss Coslet resigns from Bengals
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Unable to raise the sunken Bengals from the bottom
of the NFL, Bruce Coslet resigned as head coach in an emotional
farewell meeting with team president Mike Brown on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Brown then appointed 63-year-old defensive coordinator Dick
LeBeau as the eighth head coach of the Bengals the day after a 37-0
loss at Baltimore, the most lopsided defeat in the franchise's
33-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Bengals radio analyst Dave Lapham reported that Brown first
offered the job to linebackers coach Mark Duffner, who rejected it
in a show of support for LeBeau. Club officials didn't deny
Lapham's claim.
</P>
<P>
   LeBeau becomes the NFL's oldest rookie head coach since 1970. A
pair of 62 year olds _ Bud Wilkinson of the St. Louis Cardinals and
Rod Rust of the New England Patriots _ broke into the league in
1978 and 1990, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   What Coslet couldn't do _ turn around a team that owns a 43-104
record since 1991 and is off to its fifth 0-3 start in that span _
LeBeau is eager to try.
</P>
<P>
   He said offensive coordinator Ken Anderson will call the
offensive plays and Duffner, a former college head coach at Holy
Cross and Maryland, will help him run the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches and I recognize the challenge that's in front of
us,'' LeBeau said at an afternoon news conference at Paul Brown
Stadium. ``It's an honor to be charged with that responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a difficult day. It is not a particular happy day, but
nonetheless we welcome this challenge. We think we can be a great
part of the solution. I expect our players to play hard and
spirited, and I think you will see a spirited team.''
</P>
<P>
   LeBeau said he spoke with Coslet and tried to talk him out of a
resignation that ends his 24-year stay with the team _ eight as a
player (1969-76) and 16 as a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he was not to be swayed,'' LeBeau said. ``I was totally
shocked by this. As a friend, my heart goes out to him. He's a
tremendous coach and a tremendous man.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is done is done. Bruce understands that. Our task is to
look forward from this day and to build this team back to where
it's competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Coslet's spirit was broken after the loss at Baltimore dropped
his record to 21-39. He went 7-2 as Dave Shula's replacement in
1996, but steadily went downhill: 7-9 in '97, 3-13 in '98, 4-12 in
'99 and 0-3 in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the Ravens ``thrashed us every way imaginable. It was
hard for our people. It was hard for Bruce. This was a rock bottom
occasion, and when I walked into the locker room after the game, he
said to me: 'Could I talk with you first thing (Monday) morning?' I
said 'yes.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a petty good idea of what he had in mind, but I wasn't
sure that after he thought about it all night that he would look on
it any differently (Monday) morning,'' Brown added. ``When I met
with him, he simply offered his resignation and I accepted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt that coaching was harder on him than it was meant to
be. That it wasn't clear that he could do for the team what needed
to be done and he decided he should leave. He was apologetic to me
for leaving in the middle of the season, and it was hard for me
because he's a good man, a good friend and a good coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very emotional, personal conversation. There wasn't a
lot exchanged in words. But I appreciate what he has done and what
he has gone through. He gave it his best effort. No one can
question that.''
</P>
<P>
   Coslet couldn't be reached Monday at his Butler County home. He
had left the complex before the afternoon news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing he said was he had no plans,'' Brown said. ``He
needs some time to step back and think about his situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown broke the news to the players in a meeting and LeBeau put
the team on alert to be ready for practice on Wednesday for the
Miami Dolphins on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten to the point that this (losing) has to stop,''
right guard Mike Goff said. ``It's as simple as that. He basically
said that it's going to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   LeBeau, a native of London, Ohio, and an Ohio State star from
1954-57, spent 1959-72 as a cornerback for the Detroit Lions. He
played in 171 straight NFL games, was voted to three Pro Bowls and
is tied for sixth on the league's all-time interceptions list with
62.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anyone with the Bengals who is more knowledgable
about football,'' Brown said about LeBeau ``He can talk to players
in a way they understand he's a good teacher. I think he can step
in now and take our situation and get it back on course as quickly
as anybody could. But it isn't going to be an easy challenge for
him and we're fully aware of how difficult it will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has our confidence. He has the confidence of his fellow
coaches and of the players as well.''
</P>
<P>
   LeBeau has a reputation for being quiet and laid-back, but he's
intense and serious about his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen very animated coaches. I've seen seen very
introverted coaches and both types be very successful,'' LeBeau
said. ``I don't know that my particular personality will have any
bearing other than how the players react to me, which I think will
be positive. I'm positive of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Are the Bengals better than they play?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question about that,'' LeBeau said.
``We're going to answer that on the field. Hopefully, what happened
to us Sunday will not happen to us again, and you'll begin to see a
much more competitive performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 0-3. I think there are accountability issues at every
phase, coaching and playing. There will be some changes. I was a
player for 14 years. I've coached in this league for 28 years. That
adds up to 42, so I think I have some ideas. We are in the process
of formulating those.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we have a good talented young football team. We've
got to look at all the reasons why we're not getting it done.''

 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Salone del Gusto of Slow Food, at the end of October in Turin,
Italy, promises an array of good things to savor. The official Slow
Food Web site describes it as an international movement with 60,000
members, intended to counter ``the effect fast food has on our
society and life. It questions the validity of the fast food
philosophy as an unconscious credo that erodes our culinary
heritage in the guise of efficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   The five-day conference includes meals and ``taste workshops''
such as:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Cream puddings . . . From French chocolate mousse to Italian
panna cotta, not forgetting bavarois.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Fat ox country,'' based on the Fair of the Fat Ox in Carru,
Italy, where the speciality _ hit the deck, vegetarians _ is boiled
meats. ``Trolleys piled high with the smoking cuts _ blade bone,
head, shin, tongue and tail, plus chicken and cotechino, and all
the classic sauces _ do the rounds among the ecstatic.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Beer and chocolate. A workshop not to be missed. . . . A
selection of stouts go where even wine fears to tread: as an
accompaniment to chocolate. A tough, carefully prepared challenge
to discover beers of the highest level capable of happily marrying
chocolate.''

</P>
<P>
   Cristina is eight months pregnant, and the Times of London
reports that some Spaniards aren't happy that a child who could
become king of Spain _ he will be seventh in line _ could be born
in Australia. The mother-to-be is traveling with her gynecologist.

YUGOSLAVIA'S OPPOSITION LEADER CLAIMS VICTORY OVER MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The opposition candidate in the Yugoslav
presidential election claimed victory Monday over Slobodan
Milosevic, but with official vote counting suspended, there were
concerns whether Milosevic was willing to acknowledge defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Vojislav Kostunica, the opposition candidate, said
that according to their tally of more than 65 percent of the vote
from Sunday's election, he was ahead of Milosevic by 55 percent to
34 percent, which would give Kostunica a clear first-round victory,
without the need for a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to our count, a first-round victory is certain,''
Kostunica declared. ``Dawn is coming to Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the opposition's assertion of a first-round victory is
not accepted, Milosevic's allies fear the election could be the
beginning of the end of his 13-year rule. Monday night more than
20,000 people gathered in central Belgrade for a concert and rally
to celebrate the showing of Kostunica (pronounced
kosh-TOON-eet-zah).
</P>
<P>
   But earlier in the day, Milosevic's government said, in effect,
not so fast. After a long night and day of debate within the ruling
coalition, headed by Milosevic and his wife, Mirjana Markovic,
together with the heads of the police and the army, the decision
seemed to be to buy time. No official results were released, and
indications were that they could come as late as Thursday, the
legal deadline.
</P>
<P>
   By the ruling coalition's count, based on some 37 percent of the
vote, Milosevic leads, 45 percent to 40 percent. A Socialist Party
official, Gorica Gajevic, said these results show ``the probability
that our candidate, Slobodan Milosevic, will win in the first
round.''
</P>
<P>
   But declaring a first-round win would be difficult for the party
to tough out, given the apparent size of Milosevic's defeat _ but
he and Markovic may decide to try.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defeat is too obvious to be denied,'' said one former
party official. ``They didn't expect such poor results. Even a
small defeat is a problem for Milosevic. Now it's hard for him to
find a way out without creating a crisis inside the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its Western allies, who have made ousting
Milosevic a priority and who made war against Yugoslavia last year
over Kosovo, urged Milosevic to accept defeat. While they
originally cast doubt on the freedom and fairness of these
elections, Western officials are now hailing them as a marvelous
demonstration of the popular will.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said Monday
that if Milosevic accepts defeat and democratic change takes place,
Washington would take steps to lift sanctions against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Milosevic's federal prime minister, Momir Bulatovic,
said that Milosevic's mandate as president runs through its
original term of July 2001, regardless of the outcome of these
elections. The Constitution is unclear on the point, but other laws
indicate that his mandate should end within 10 days of losing the
election.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica, a 56-year-old constitutional lawyer, is a moderate
nationalist who has deeply criticized the legal justification for
NATO's bombing war over Yugoslavia. He has called the bombing of
civilian targets possible war crimes, and says he would not hand
over Milosevic to the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica describes himself as a Western-oriented liberal
democrat and once translated ``The Federalist Papers'' into
Serbian.
</P>
<P>
   Ljubisa Ristic, president of Markovic's party, the Yugoslav
United Left, suggested that if there were a runoff, the government
would accept ``the will of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   A second round, judging by the first, would mean an even more
crushing defeat for Milosevic, and some in his party were said to
have argued against trying to force one, instead urging recognition
of defeat. Milosevic officials say they won control of the federal
parliament, largely because the government of the sister republic,
Montenegro, decided to boycott the election.
</P>
<P>
   A number of officials, especially in Markovic's party,
reportedly argued that any concession could mean the rapid
disintegration of Milosevic's control over Serbia, and they urged
delay, a second round or even the rerunning of the elections.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition leaders said Monday that if their final tally
still indicates that they won a first-round victory, they will
demand it, even if the Federal Election Commission disagrees and
calls for a second round.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders said the commission, which must verify the
vote totals reached at local polling stations, had stopped its work
early Monday morning and had not resumed counting, which they
regarded as suspicious and another effort by the government to buy
time.
</P>
<P>
   Each party has representatives at the polls who are informed of
those counts, but the electoral commission in Belgrade has not
announced vote totals. The commission contains two representatives
from each political coalition, but a majority of its 28 members are
appointed by the government. Its task is formally technical, to
total local polling results and rule on any disparities. The
opposition intends to call a large rally in Belgrade and other
towns across Serbia for Wednesday night to demonstrate for
recognition of their victory, an opposition leader said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Socialists declare victory or say we go to a second
round, and it goes against the voting data we gather, we must
defend our vote,'' said one opposition leader, Zarko Korac. ``Why
should we accept his offer for a second round, if it's illegal? Our
problems are in a way beginning: We have to get him to concede his
defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   While the opposition and Kostunica appear to have little taste
for street revolution, many analysts believe that the size of
Milosevic's apparent defeat will quickly become known, despite his
control over the state media, and that even the police will be
reluctant to beat or shoot demonstrators now. While they broke up
rallies against him after his defeat in Kosovo, Milosevic was still
widely accepted as the legitimate and legal president of
Yugoslavia. Now matters are not quite so clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers speak for us,'' Kostunica said. ``We will fight in
democratic ways. The truth is our strongest weapon. We don't want
to provoke internal tensions and foreign intervention.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The opposition also did extremely well in municipalities,
sweeping Belgrade and other large cities despite a split with the
Serbian Renewal Movement of Vuk Draskovic, which suffered enormous
defeats along with the Radical Party of ultranationalist Vojislav
Seselj. Draskovic admitted Monday he had been wrong to run a
campaign separate from Kostunica. Both Draskovic and Seselj offered
to resign _ offers their parties are unlikely to accept.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica's insistence on unity at both federal and local levels
proved to have been wise in the landslide of anti-government
voting.
</P>
<P>
   While the pro-Western president of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic,
succeeded in protecting his base by boycotting the federal
election, the boycott handed Milosevic control of both houses of
the federal parliament, which he could not have won otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he takes office, Kostunica _ already contemplating
choices for prime minister _ will not have many formal powers as
president. Milosevic really runs the country from his position at
the apex of the Socialist Party and its web of politicians and
businessmen. But if Milosevic is beaten, his own party will have to
look beyond him and Kostunica will be a major voice and symbol of
democratic change.

<P>
   CORAL GABLES, Fla. _ Campaigning in Florida, where nearly 40
percent of the voters may be 60 or older, Vice President Al Gore
pledged Monday to strengthen sanctions against health maintenance
organizations that pull out of the Medicare market, and to
eliminate Medicare co-payments and deductibles for a variety of
preventative tests.
</P>
<P>
   Gore unveiled those proposals in a speech in St. Petersburg that
opened a weeklong discussion of Medicare policy, an issue that is
particularly potent in Florida. Before flying here to attend
several fund-raisers, Gore used his speech to convey his stark
differences on the issue with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, a
comparison that illustrates the broader philosophical differences
between the two campaigns. Along those lines, Gore also drew
attention to a five-year-old interview in which Bush expressed
support for the deep Medicare cuts championed by former House
Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides provided reporters with a videotape of the Oct. 19,
1995, interview by an Austin, Texas, television station in which
Bush commended that year's House Republican plan to cut $270
billion over seven years from Medicare, the federal health
insurance program for the elderly. The proposal died after a
prolonged budget battle with congressional Democrats and the White
House that prompted two government shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elderly people will not suffer as a result of this plan,''
Bush said in the interview with KXAN. ``It's going to make the plan
solvent. And Republicans will be heralded, not only for saving
Medicare, but at the same time for having the political courage to
balance the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides then made him available for an interview with The
New York Times, in which he said Bush's comments were ``very
revealing of his basic attitude toward Medicare'' and belied his
claim to being a new kind of Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't like it,'' Gore said. ``He disagrees with its basic
premise, and he is looking for any politically viable opportunity
to gut it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore then charged that Bush would do ``virtually the same thing
to Medicare that Gingrich proposed _ raising premiums, taking money
out of Medicare for a tax cut that goes mainly to the wealthy,
forcing seniors into HMOs, privatizing Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Bush, said Bush had made it clear
with his 10-year plan to restructure Medicare, at a cost of $198
billion, that he is committed to the program. Bush's proposal,
issued earlier this month, would allow private insurers to compete
with the government to provide a variety of coverage options, some
of which could include prescription drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``His proposals will strengthen Medicare so it will be just as
successful in the future as it has been in the past for millions of
seniors,'' Bartlett said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bush's comments in 1995, Bartlett said, ``What is
important here is not what Governor Bush said about a plan five
years ago that wasn't even his. What's important is what he says
about his plan today.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's trip was Gore's fourth to Florida since the Democratic
convention last month, and his ninth since early March. But despite
that sign that Gore is competing aggressively for the state's 25
electoral votes, his campaign admits that it is being badly
outspent here on television advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Koch, a senior consultant to the campaign in Florida, said
the Bush campaign and the Republican National Committee had spent
an estimated $2.2 million on advertising from Sept. 11-19, compared
to $330,000 by the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A senior campaign official said Monday that Gore or his running
mate, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, would travel to Florida each week
between now and election day. The official also said the campaign
would be increasing its advertising and ground troops in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign considers Medicare a major issue partly
because it plays well in key states like Florida that have large
elderly populations. But Gore's strategists also know that with 39
million beneficiaries nationwide _ a number that is projected to
more than double by 2035 _ Medicare is a significant concern for a
large cross-section of voters. Indeed, The vice president also used
the Medicare issue to batter his opponent in the Democratic
primaries, former Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech in St. Petersburg, Gore vowed that ``the heart of
my agenda is a rock-solid commitment to Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading from a TelePromTer, Gore explained the key elements of
his Medicare proposals: to protect the projected $360 billion,
10-year Medicare surplus by placing it in a secure fund, to add a
voluntary prescription drug benefit at a cost of $338 billion, and
to invest $40 billion in reimbursement for nursing homes, teaching
hospitals, rural hospitals, home health agencies and rehabilitative
services.
</P>
<P>
   Those were among the proposals that were repackaged in a 74-page
booklet on Medicare that was released by Gore Monday, three weeks
after he issued a 191-page synopsis of his economic plan.
</P>
<P>
   But the booklet also outlined Gore's new proposals to impose an
array of sanctions against health maintenance organizations that
pull out of the Medicare market, a growing problem. Gore would
prevent HMOs that drop coverage of Medicare recipients from
returning to that market for four years, double the existing
sanction of two years.
</P>
<P>
   He also would require HMOs to sign up Medicare beneficiaries for
two years instead of the current one year. And the vice president
would ban HMOs from the Medicare market if they show a persistent
pattern of cherry-picking the least expensive recipients by
offering coverage in relatively healthy communities while not
offering it in less healthy ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will no longer just accept the rising wave of HMOs dropping
seniors and denying them coverage, all to enhance their bottom
line,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Another new proposal would eliminate existing Medicare
copayments and deductibles for preventive services like hepatitis B
vaccinations, colorectal and prostate cancer screenings,
mammographies, pelvic exams and bone mass measurements. Gore aides
said those changes would cost $8 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``No seniors should be priced out of tests that could save their
lives,'' Gore said.

COLLEGE, THE NEW MIDDLE CLASS ENTITLEMENT

<P>
   LEXINGTON, Mass. _ California's legislature has created a new
educational entitlement: Lots of kids will be going to college free
of charge.
</P>
<P>
   Sound good? It isn't. It's likely to harm the great public
universities of the state, as well as undermine California's drive
for standards in elementary and secondary education. And it won't
address the real problem: the inadequate academic preparation of
too many high school graduates, particularly those from low-income
families.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the program works. Students who maintain a ``B''
average in high school are guaranteed a grant (called a Cal Grant)
sufficient to cover the costs of attending a state college or
university. Even those who plan to go to private institutions like
Stanford University will receive impressive help in the form of a
voucher worth up to $9,708 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Children of the rich won't qualify, but students don't have to
be poor. The annual income ceiling for a family of four is $64,100;
for a family of six, it's $74,100.
</P>
<P>
   There's help as well for students whose high school grades
average only a ``C,'' but who are from families earning less than
$33,700 a year. If they go to a community college, the state will
provide roughly $1,500 for books and living expenses. If that
student later transfers to a four-year school, he or she will
receive full tuition plus the same stipend for additional expenses.
</P>
<P>
   It's the ``most ambitious financial aid program in America,''
Gov. Gray Davis has noted. All of California seems to be in a
swoon. Every legislator voted for it. Newspapers are lavishing
praise. College administrators are ecstatic. ``This reinstates the
California dream,'' one state university chancellor said.
</P>
<P>
   Promoting mediocrity on behalf of middle class kids would be a
more accurate description. The program is advertised as helping the
``needy,'' but community colleges are free, California state
colleges only charge student fees, and even the elite University of
California schools are inexpensive compared with private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Low-income students are already served by federal, state,
private and university programs, and California offered no evidence
that financial need was a barrier to college attendance. More
low-income students will attend college only when they have the
skills to do the work demanded.
</P>
<P>
   The main beneficiaries of the new policy are thus likely to be
middle class students who have traditionally had limited access to
scholarships. This will especially be the case if colleges use
funds typically reserved for low-income applicants to help the
financially unchallenged. The academically accomplished kid from a
family earning, say, $85,000 a year may now have a good shot at
financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   A high school diploma is already close to an entitlement in the
view of the American public _ an unacknowledged problem in states
threatening to deny diplomas to students unable to demonstrate
competency in core subjects.
</P>
<P>
   As Ward Connerly, a member of the University of California Board
of Regents, has noted, California is now ``moving toward the notion
that college, too, is an entitlement instead of something you
earned.''
</P>
<P>
   What school will have the courage to turn down applicants upon
whom funds have been bestowed with a promise of ``access''?
Admissions standards to the selective public colleges will
inevitably drop; course requirements will become less rigorous.
</P>
<P>
   Already inflated grades at high schools are also likely to rise.
In the last decade, while national SAT scores have dropped, the
percentage of students reporting an average in the ``A'' range has
risen from 28 to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Davis claims that the Cal Grants will encourage
students to work harder. It is more likely to force high schools to
inflate grades further. If a ``B'' grade is worth up to $9,000,
what ``caring'' teacher will give anything less?
</P>
<P>
   In any case, a ``B'' is hardly a bang-up grade, and its meaning
differs from one school to the next. California could have tied
grants to test scores, but the idea of merit has become an elitist
notion. Instead of playing entitlement games of one sort or another
and throwing money where it's not needed, why not just educate the
kids?

   LONDON _ As Yugoslavia voted over the weekend, one friend's
message summed up the e-mail from Belgrade pouring into my mailbox.
``We're all in election fever, hope and horror at the same time.
Wish us luck!''
</P>
<P>
   No amount of analysis and informed guesswork could have caught
the mood better.
</P>
<P>
   At dawn yesterday, less than 12 hours after the polls had
closed, Zarko Korac, my friend and the leader of one of Serbia's
opposition parties, sent this: ``It is a cold and cloudy morning in
Belgrade, but I see some strange light. Whatever happened, Serbia
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's not over yet. As I write, both the opposition
and the forces of Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, are
claiming victory, and votes are still being counted.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever happens next, Serbia is highly unlikely ever to be
the same. Milosevic has suffered a tremendous blow. He may not be
out, but he is certainly down.
</P>
<P>
   This was clear already on Sunday night, when the riot police
deployed in the center of Belgrade to head off potential clashes
between supporters of Milosevic and his opposition ended up
chatting with the Milosevic opponents, who were chanting: ``Slobo,
kill yourself! Save Serbia!'' Only a couple of hundred Milosevic
supporters showed up, and, dejected, they went home.
</P>
<P>
   So, Milosevic has lost a battle. But has he lost the war? We
will see what he decides to do in the next few days. But, with the
opposition claiming a landslide in both presidential and local
elections, it would seem very hard now for Milosevic to recapture
the genie of democracy that he unwittingly released. Of course his
own camp is also declaring victory, but in a muted sort of way. And
that is important. With credibility oozing away, the bonds of
loyalty loosen.
</P>
<P>
   It is not too late, of course, for Milosevic to clamp down and
send Serbia squarely back on the road to becoming Europe's own
pocket Cuba. But with every hour that passes, it becomes more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   How did Slobodan Milosevic, the archtactician who, until now,
had gambled and lost everything except his own hold on power, make
such a fatal mistake? He set the terms of the election. He said:
``It's me or NATO!''
</P>
<P>
   But the opposition finally managed to unite, and it shrewdly
chose a candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, who could not be tarred as a
NATO supporter. This turned the tables. The question became:
Milosevic or someone else? And more people than ever before have
chosen someone else.
</P>
<P>
   In part this is thanks to the students from the Otpor resistance
movement who trudged the highways and byways of Serbia, quietly
mobilizing people against their president. Many in the West
dismissed this sort of challenge to Milosevic, saying dictators are
not removed through the ballot box. But that is to misunderstand
the nature of Milosevic and to fall prey to our own Western
rhetoric of Serbian tyranny and dictatorship. For Serbs, Milosevic
is an authoritarian ruler, but not a tyrant.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting Albanians or Muslims may be one thing, but Milosevic
has not been shooting young Serbs, at least as of yesterday.
Thousands have been detained, beaten and intimidated. Newspapers
have been shut down, and one brave journalist, Miroslav Filipovic,
is in prison.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no Serbian gulag, and there are no mass graves of
young Serbs who have raised their voices against Milosevic.
Whatever he does now, and unless he does start shooting people, it
is equally unlikely that Otpor and the opposition will give up the
struggle until he is gone.
</P>
<P>
   So, what if Milosevic is indeed on the way out?
</P>
<P>
   First, the issue of independence for Montenegro would fade away.
The question of Kosovo would not, but with Kostunica at its head, a
new Serbia would argue with words, not bullets, that Kosovo
belonged to Serbia. That would be bad news for Kosovo's Albanians,
who want independence and for whom Milosevic, an indicted war
criminal with whom no one could be expected to talk, has therefore
been an asset.
</P>
<P>
   And for Serbia itself, for the heartland? It is now a disaster
zone economically and socially, not helped by 78 days of NATO
bombing, of course, but a catastrophe primarily of Milosevic's
making.
</P>
<P>
   The last 10 years have knocked Serbia back to an extraordinary
degree. Huge problems remain to be solved, both among the Serbs and
between Serbs and their neighbors. But it seems clear that there is
reason for hope and that Zarko Korac is right: Something has
changed.

 &HT;    Cheney greeted by soggy protesters in Ohio
 &HT;    By Susan M. Cover

<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ohio _ As his motorcade pulled up Montgomery
Avenue, Republican vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney was
greeted Monday by soaking wet but enthusiastic Gore-Lieberman
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen people holding signs in favor of the Democratic
presidential ticket gathered outside Eagle Tool and Machine Co. to
wave signs and shout slogans. The constant rain and cold
temperatures didn't keep 80-year-old C.W. Gatten from speaking his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a taxpaying citizen, I object strongly to the state
troopers, squads and police,'' he said. ``The don't need half of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's entourage included plenty of local and Secret Service
protection _ complete with at least two men stationed on the roof
of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Young-Johnson didn't mind letting Gore-Lieberman
supporters get out of the rain by standing on her porch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knocked on my door this morning and told me Cheney would
be right next door,'' she said as she held her 10 month-old-son
J'Aun. ``I said 'Yeah, I'll stand for my party.'''
</P>
<P>
   Young-Johnson, who works as an accountant at the local Wal-Mart,
said she has been a Democrat since she took high school government.
</P>
<P>
   Wittenberg University Professor Jeff Ankrom and Democratic
candidate Ron Rhine stood on Young-Johnson's porch to talk about
why they think the Gore tax cut proposal is better than the one
proposed by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like about the Democratic plan is that it looks at
individual circumstances and targets the tax cuts,'' said Ankrom,
an economics professor at Wittenberg for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ankrom, a Democrat, said the party asked him to analyze the tax
cut proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Rhine, who faces Republican Roger Evans in the race for the 73rd
District Ohio House of Representatives seat, said more
Springfielders would benefit from the Gore-Lieberman plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the people in Springfield and Clark County need to
know that Bush and Cheney's plan has absolutely nothing in it for
the working people, the labor people in this community,'' Rhine
said.
</P>
<P>
   Just down the street, a group of ardent Democrats gathered
directly across from the plant holding signs that said ``Gore
Fights for Working Families,'' and ``Read My Lips Goodbye George.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Dyer, 18, a senior at Springfield North High School,
started to go hoarse toward the end of the rally. He said he's
working to get students interested in the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to fix the problem, but he's part of the
problem,'' Dyer said of Cheney.

<P>
   If chivalry is not dead, then maybe Terrell Owens just needs
more time. The San Francisco 49ers wide receiver provided NFL fans
a decidedly classless gesture Sunday, sprinting to the Dallas
Cowboys star logo at midfield of Texas Stadium after scoring both
of his touchdowns and exulting, arms spread wide.
</P>
<P>
   Owens was unrepentant after the game, although both Owens'
coaches and teammates were puzzled, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what got into Terrell,'' linebacker Winfred Tubbs
said. ``He must have been excited. When the adrenaline starts
flowing, you do things you shouldn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the team fined Owens a week's pay, $24,294, and
announced he has been excused from team activities for the week and
won't play Sunday against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, though, does win the irony award for the week. In the
first quarter, wide receiver Jerry Rice and coach Steve Mariucci
got into a heated argument on the sideline. Guess who was there to
calm down the steamed Rice?
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Owens.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, his actions sullied San Francisco's second win in
its past 16 games. Running back Charlie Garner set a club record
with 201 rushing yards and quarterback Jeff Garcia threw a
career-high four touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is: Is he going to do this every time he
scores?
</P>
<P>
   McNabb index up
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Philadelphia quarterback Donovan McNabb was a
hero in the Eagles' demolition of Dallas. He floundered the next
two weeks, and Philadelphians said he was regressing. Sunday,
McNabb threw for 222 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions.
Apparently, he's back on track to becoming the next Joe Montana.
</P>
<P>
   The performance shouldn't be downplayed. McNabb handled himself
well on the road against the league's top-ranked defense. But, this
hardly means his problems are over. Considering it was only his
10th career start, it's safe to assume there will be more
inconsistency before he evens out.
</P>
<P>
   Bucs fumble, stumble
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the biggest problem that Tampa Bay has to solve after its
humbling loss to the New York Jets is to figure out why its offense
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into the game, the Buccaneers ranked a decent 13th in the
league in total offense and quarterback Shaun King was the
fourth-ratedpasser in the NFC. Sunday, the Bucs gained 239 yards _
59 in the second half. King was 7-for-19 passing and threw his
first two interceptions of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Mike Alstott fumbled late in the fourth quarter, his
second of the year. It set up the Jets' winning touchdown pass from
running back Curtis Martin to wide receiver Wayne Chrebet. Alstott
fumbled six times last year, tying him with New Orleans' Ricky
Williams for most by an NFC running back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of this offense being the butt of the whole team,''
guard Frank Middleton said. ``We better get this thing going back
in the right direction right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's news
</P>
<P>
   Carolina defensive end and ex-Falcon Chuck Smith will have
surgeon James Andrews look at his surgically reconstructed knee
today, Panthers coach George Siefert said. Andrews performed
surgery on Smith's creaky knee in February after Smith signed a
five-year, $21.75 million contract with the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Smith rarely practices and missed the second game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco defensive lineman Junior Bryant will miss the rest
of the season because of a bulging disc in his neck. He suffered
the injury when he landed head-first on the turf at St. Louis'
Trans World Dome two Sundays ago.

 &HT;    Surgeon remembered for device that helped hearts
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - It's hard to say how many years earlier Josh
Hennessy could have been born without the right side of his heart
and still survived. Even eight years ago, he barely lasted 48
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot has changed since my mom and dad were my age,'' the
second-grader said, excerpting from the short speech he gives
occasionally to raise money for heart research. Doctors didn't have
so many ways to fix bad hearts back then, he said. ``Kids like me
didn't have a chance to grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Josh not only can ride his bike and play baseball and
soccer, he also has gotten to know the doctor whose innovation 45
years ago made it possible to repair hearts even if surgery made
them temporarily useless for pumping blood. Dr. Richard DeWall of
Oakwood developed the first heart-lung machine that was practical
for widespread use when he was at the University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was designed for children,'' DeWall said. People with the
most serious congenital heart defects didn't become adults.
</P>
<P>
   Josh was born without a tricuspid valve, which separates the
blood-receiving chamber on the right side of the heart from the
pumping chamber that sends blood to the lungs for oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Without that valve, the entire right side of his heart was
undeveloped. Only because of another defect was any blood able to
make its way to his lungs and carry oxygen to the heart's left
side, which pumps blood throughout the body. He had heart surgery
twice in his first year and again at 3.
</P>
<P>
   The problem wasn't apparent right away, but ``When he went for
his 24-hour checkup, he didn't get returned very fast,'' his
mother, Heidi, said. Heidi and her husband, Kelly, still
celebrating the birth of their first child, suddenly were
bludgeoned with the news that their bundle of joy had turned blue
from oxygen deprivation and might not go home alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing was controlling your imagination, trying not
to think of all the things that could go wrong,'' Kelly said. The
couple, now with three more healthy children in Troy, took turns
that night lifting each other up from the chasms of anger and
depression, reminding each other to focus on hopes instead of
fears.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's first thought was that the doctors would just put in an
artificial valve. ``We're so used to medical solutions,'' he said,
but Josh's heart needed more than just a valve. An operation wasn't
even feasible right away. His tiny lungs needed to develop more
before they could accept a better blood source than the leak Josh
was born with.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was getting enough oxygen to survive,'' Kelly said. So
about a week later, the Hennessys took home their new baby boy with
what his mother called ``kind of a blue tint to him all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   After Josh's first surgery at 3 months, Heidi's eyes glanced
right past the disturbing sight of countless tubes coming out of
her baby boy. The first thing she remembers noticing, she said, was
``he had pink fingernails.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next two surgeries, doctors constructed a conduit that
would redirect the blood from Josh's veins directly to his lungs,
bypassing the nonfunctioning right side of his heart. In order to
do that, to work inside the heart, they had to find another
mechanism for sending blood through his body to nourish his cells
with oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a machine to temporarily replace the heart and lungs
was discussed in the early 19th century and scientifically examined
in an 1848 publication, DeWall said. A hundred years later,
physicians and technicians still were trying to design one that
worked.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's med school had a culture that encouraged surgical
innovation in the 1940s. It required residents in training to do
laboratory research projects. It also had surgeons repairing the
heart's exterior with new procedures, including one to reopen a
valve that had been closed up by rheumatic fever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a very sophisticated operation,'' DeWall said. ``You
just opened the heart and stuck your finger in it and stretched
open the closed valve.'' But at its time, it was the kind of
cutting-edge technology that drew patients from hundreds of miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   That was about when Dr. Walton Lillehei arrived at Minnesota,
followed by Dr. Morley Cohen and Herbert Warden as residents after
Lillehei established a lab dedicated to cardiovascular surgery.
Cohen's wife was pregnant, as DeWall tells the story, and the three
of them got to wondering that if a fetus could be supported by an
auxiliary circulation _ the mother _ why couldn't doctors do
something similar during heart surgery?
</P>
<P>
   Working with dogs, DeWall said they determined it was possible
for a bigger dog to share its blood volume with a smaller dog and
``supply all of the blood needs of the patient dog. Then you could
open up the patient dog's heart and work on the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota was doing these controlled cross-circulation
procedures on dogs when DeWall came along, a family-practice doctor
looking for research experience. The school didn't have money
budgeted for another doctor, so he was hired as an animal
attendant. ``That was fine by me,'' he said, ``because it paid
several times what the residents were getting.''
</P>
<P>
   Lillehei's team began doing heart surgery with human donors for
cross circulation in 1954. ``It wasn't terribly dangerous for the
donor,'' DeWall said, with a calibrated pump making sure the person
shared and took back identical amounts of blood. But still, the
doctors were putting healthy people under anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walt received a lot of criticism at that time about taking on
a procedure that had a potential for a 200 percent mortality
rate,'' DeWall said.
</P>
<P>
   His loudest critic soon settled down, however, after being part
of the first surgical team that put a healthy person under
anesthesia in order to transplant a kidney to someone else.
Chuckling at the memory, DeWall said, ``They say there's a great
deal of knowledge that comes out of Boston but very little gets
back in.''
</P>
<P>
   When DeWall soon took charge of the lab, Lillehei encouraged him
to devise a machine that could replace the human donors. DeWall
already had given a lot of thought to open-heart surgery since
helplessly watching a young seaman die during the Korean War
because of a defective heart valve. We replace bad valves on
mechanical pumps all the time, he thought. Why can't we do that
with hearts?
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to fix the valve you have to get inside the heart,''
DeWall said. ``In order to do that, you have to be able to bypass
the blood (around the heart) and support the body by some other
means.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government wasn't funding medical research back
then, so the American Heart Association paid for DeWall's expenses
and salary. Even so, he built the various machines he tried out of
``odds and ends, scraps out of the laboratory.''
</P>
<P>
   Helped by Warden's expertise in the physiology of flowing blood,
DeWall came up with something that used a plastic hose and an
industrial pump, which massaged fluid through the hose with
mechanical fingers. ``It only cost about $15 or $18 to make,'' and
was disposed after one use. It put oxygen into the patient's blood
by blowing oxygen at it, literally bubbling the blood.
</P>
<P>
   So the first practical heart-lung machine was called a bubble
oxygenator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to give anybody the impression that my work was
the sole work in the world at that time,'' DeWall said. In fact,
similar research was going on less than 100 miles away at the Mayo
Clinic, ``So there was kind of a mutual supporting system.''
</P>
<P>
   After using the bubble oxygenator on a number of dogs, DeWall
said, ``I didn't kill any of them,'' so the med school's review
board gave approval to use it on humans. The first open-heart
surgery with a mechanical oxygenator was in May 1955.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the real heroes to us,'' Heidi Hennessy said. ``We
just get a feeling of awe that someone invented something that made
it possible for my son to be alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 114,000 Americans under 21 are living with congenital
heart defects after having undergone surgery at least once.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox Heart Institute drew DeWall to Dayton in 1966, and he
eventually helped establish Kettering Medical Center's open-heart
surgical program and the Wright State University School of
Medicine. Now 73 and retired, he was recognized last spring when
the Miami Valley American Heart Association attached his name to
its annual award for life-changing treatment of cardiovascular
disease and stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Josh met DeWall at the banquet and eventually recruited the
surgeon for his team in the fund-raising Heart Walk. He's
remarkably healthy at 8, taking medicine only to prevent blood
clotting and control his blood pressure. His future is uncertain,
simply because there are very few people older than Josh who had
the same operation.
</P>
<P>
   But his parents are encouraged by the pace of medical research.
When they think Josh might need a heart transplant someday, they
remember that Dr. Joseph Ross, his cardiologist, says heart
transplants might turn out to be as routine as heart bypasses by
the time he needs one.
</P>
<P>
   Josh has three younger brothers and sisters whose first days of
life were uneventful. Like most parents, Heidi and Kelly probably
would have taken the babies' health for granted if Josh hadn't
shown them so vividly what could go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happened,'' said Heidi, ``is this enormous appreciation
whenever we had a healthy child.''

 &HT;    Managers of park defend their plans
 &HT;    By Ben Smith
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STONE MOUNTAIN, Ga _ To some who've never heard of Silver Dollar
City, the company that runs Stone Mountain Park must sound like a
Vegas casino.
</P>
<P>
   To those who know the company operates theme parks in Branson,
Mo., and Pigeon Forge, Tenn. _ choice destinations for lovers of
retired country music acts, Elvis impersonators and outlet shopping
_ it's an amusement park operator that's about to blight a
Confederate monument and Mother Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since securing a lease to manage Stone Mountain Park
operations, Silver Dollar officials have been fighting an uphill
battle to convince opponents that they aren't the tacky carny
operators they've been made out to be.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they operate parks in Pigeon Forge and Branson. But the
parks are located on the edge or well outside those towns on
heavily wooded tracts. They say they replant two trees for every
one they cut down. They've won environmental awards.
</P>
<P>
   They operate their parks ``all in manner consistent with
Christian values and ethics'' without being preachy, they say.
</P>
<P>
   They don't sell schlocky rubber tomahawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to leave Atlanta. We want to prove that we're
the good guys,'' company chief executive officer Mel Bilbo said
during a tour of the Branson theme park by a Stone Mountain Park
delegation this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Stone Mountain Memorial Association, the park's governing
board, last week voted to accept the company's 10-year, $75 million
plan in concept to build theme park attractions at the Confederate
memorial.
</P>
<P>
   They are opposed by longtime park lovers who consider the
3,200-acre tract one of the last significant sanctuaries of green
space in a metropolis overrun by development. The opponents vow to
continue their objections to the company's projects as the
schematics for each retail shop, restaurant and ride are delivered
to the board.
</P>
<P>
   The company already has begun to deliver detailed plans for
Grandpa's Barn, an attraction for children complete with swing,
slides and hay bale tunnels, a project to be completed by 2001.
Then in 2002 comes a 4D theater near the skylift. The movie house
will tell ``The Story of the South'' with a ``multi-sensorial''
film experience. For example, if there's a scene with fog on the
screen, mist will fill the audience.
</P>
<P>
   For scheduling the development of the remainder of the projects,
Silver Dollar City is adopting a wait-and-see attitude. These
projects include food and beverage stands and restaurants, shops,
craft and history exhibits, indoor rides, farm and wild animal
exhibits, a ropes course, rock climbing, hiking trails, a mountain
lodge and cabins.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials insist that what gets built in Stone Mountain
Park will be representative of Georgia, not just copies of
attractions from Branson and Pigeon Forge.
</P>
<P>
   But those parks do give some indication of what future man-made
features at Stone Mountain Park might look like.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dollywood has Dolly Parton's cabin homestead and an
old country church. Branson has an imported restored 1880s log
cabin and a replica ``Wilderness Church.'' In both places there are
mountain re-enactors, such as schoolmarms, homemakers and farmers.
Both feature craftsmaking attractions such as a blacksmith shop, a
baseball bat maker, basketweavers, glass blowers and jewelry
makers.
</P>
<P>
   Several merchants in Stone Mountain village, just outside the
park, have expressed fears of being run out of business by new
shops in the park.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers of antiques and collectibles might not be affected.
There aren't any true antique stores in the Silver Dollar City
theme parks. But in both Branson and in Stone Mountain village
there are gift shops, funnel cakes, ice cream parlors and other
similar eateries. Both have general stores. The Stone Mountain Park
plan calls for a Christmas shop; the village already has one.
</P>
<P>
   But Hilde Friese, who owns the The Village Corner German Bakery
with her husband, Claus, isn't worrying about whether a bakery
might open in the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just work three times harder to be three times
better,'' said Friese. ``This is America. Competition is good for
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Friese suggested that village businesses could even do better
with the increased number of visitors at the park. They may have to
change their hours, increase the variety of goods -- maybe pursue a
different marketing angle.
</P>
<P>
   Park authority members who've toured Silver Dollar City's theme
parks are convinced the company's redevelopment plans for Stone
Mountain would not be the environmental disaster opponents of the
company fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to see that it isn't turned into an amusement park.
We're not going to let that happen,' said Stone Mountain Memorial
Authority chairman Wayne Garner. ``I think in five or six years
people will be very pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver Dollar City officials insist there's a big difference
between amusement parks and theme parks. They only operate the
latter.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-acre Branson park stands atop Marvel Cave amid 1600 acres
of Ozark woods. It is heavily shaded by white and red oak trees. If
it could be transplanted to Stone Mountain Park, it would fit
completely in the space between the marina and the skylift.
</P>
<P>
   The point of the attractions, according to the company's vision
statement, is to bring ``the Heritage and Fun of a Geographic
Location to Life.''
</P>
<P>
   For Civil War enthusiasts, the park's historical representations
should be more solemn. For nature lovers, the park is a quiet
refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some state officials say the park's historic and ecological
credentials have been overstated. While the park is a Confederate
memorial, it has no direct historic connection to the Civil War.
Instead, it is the site of the 20th century rebirth of the Ku Klux
Klan and contains remains of an old granite quarry. The most
significant evidence of Native American life there, a prehistoric
rock wall that had encircled the summit, was obliterated before
work began on the famous rock carving.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the park's lake is man made. Its hardwood trees were
harvested a half-century ago, though there have been many
replantings since then. And the noted Yellow Daisy, Georgia Aster
and clam shrimp that can be found in rainstorm pools on top of the
mountain - while unique - are not endangered and can be found
outside the park.
</P>
<P>
   A 1993 cultural resource survey of the entire park found that
only the mountain itself might qualify for the National Register of
Historic Places. Stone Mountain is not currently on that list.
</P>
<P>
   But such facts don't make the park any less important to its
regular users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out here it's all we have,'' said Bill Chambers, owner of
Earth Star, a crystal and minerals shop in Stone Mountain village.
``We're developing everything and we don't need a roller coaster
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then again,'' Chambers added, ``in a thousand years the roller
coaster will be gone and Stone Mountain will still be there.''

   SYDNEY, Australia -- Mark Crear decided he couldn't finish
unless he started and that sensible bit of caution might have cost
him an Olympic gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   One false start from disqualification, Crear stayed in the
blocks a bit later than he wanted and gladly settled for a bronze
medal in the men's 110-meter hurdles Monday at the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering everything, I'm just happy to be on the podium one
more time,'' said Crear, silver medalist at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Anier Garcia of Cuba won the event in 13.00 seconds. Terrence
Trammell of the U.S. was second in 13.16 and Crear third in 13.22.
It was only the fifth time in 25 Olympic runnings of the event that
a non-American took the gold.
</P>
<P>
   After false-starting Monday before 110,000 people in Olympic
Stadium, Crear flashed back on the 1999 World Championships in
Seville.
</P>
<P>
   In the Worlds, he false-started twice and was disqualified.
``The false start kind of hurt me, but I learned my lesson from
Seville, so I wanted to make sure I stayed in the box,'' Crear
said.
</P>
<P>
   Crear's reaction time of .214 seconds was well behind Garcia's
.172, and Crear never caught up. He didn't break out of the pack
until the eighth hurdle and didn't reach third place until the
10th.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of start did he think he had?
</P>
<P>
   ``Evidently not a good one,'' he said, laughing. ``I tried to
sneak one in there, but we all have our bad days.''
</P>
<P>
   Crear, 32 next Monday, walked through the interview area
hand-in-hand with 4-year-old daughter Ebony.
</P>
<P>
   Did the false start cost him gold?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's hindsight,'' he said, ``but at the same time,
understand I wanted to win the gold. But to repeat as the silver
medalist, or get the gold medal ... that's my gold medal right here
in my hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you have to be thankful for what you receive. We
went through a lot of great athletes today. This is one of the best
fields, I think, in the 110 meters that's ever been assembled.
</P>
<P>
   ``So just to come in the top three, you know, I'm very happy and
thankful.''
</P>
<P>
   In his career, Crear has two national championships, two Olympic
medals and a Goodwill Games championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think this is a blessing to show what hard work, family
and dedication results in,'' he said. ``Hopefully, I represent
that.''

BUSH SAYS CLINTON ADMINISTRATION CREATED AN `EDUCATION RECESSION'

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAVERTON, Ore. _ Sounding a new slogan intended to raise
anxieties about the nation's well-being, Gov. George W. Bush
accused the Clinton administration Monday of helping to create an
``education recession'' in which minority and low-income students
are routinely allowed to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to draw a clear link between the nation's economic
health and the quality of it schools, Bush asserted that the nation
faced a reading crisis that had contributed to crime and caused
American students as a group to fall behind their peers in other
industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a leading indicator of troubles to come,'' Bush told
500 supporters in an elementary school gymnasium in this suburb of
Portland. ``Children who never master reading can never master
learning. As uneducated adults, they face a life of struggle on the
fringes of our society. Some will turn to crime and end up in
prison.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor, the Republican nominee for president,
outlined his proposals to improve grade-school reading programs,
expand scholarship programs for math and science students and
encourage annual testing of students in grades 3 through 8. He
accused his Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, of
promising change but instead protecting a failed status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call for new spending without real reform or
accountability,'' Bush said. ``It's like pumping gas into a flooded
engine.''
</P>
<P>
   Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for the Gore campaign, countered that
Bush would not be able to afford his education proposals because he
would need the entire federal surplus to pay for his proposed
military programs and tax cuts. Bush denies that.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's school event kicked off a three-day West Coast swing that
Monday took him through Washington and Oregon, states that have
voted Democratic in recent presidential elections but where recent
polls show him running neck-and-neck with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In both states, Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, has
recently drawn enthusiastic crowds of more than 10,000 people and
is considered a threat to draw disaffected Democrats away from
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also plans to spend two days in California, where polls
show Gore holding a comfortable lead. Part of Bush's for visiting
the state is to tap into its wealth: He plans to raise more than
$1.4 million for the state Republican party at fund-raisers in
Silicon Valley and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, asserted that the governor
also wanted to show that he planned to contest California until
Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't be going there, at a critical point in the
campaign, if we didn't think we couldn't compete in California,''
Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Coming nearly one week before what will probably be among the
most important moments of the fall campaign _ a nationally
televised debate with Gore _ Monday's event also gave Bush an
opportunity to fine tune his message on a signature issue before a
friendly audience.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not hold a news conference but instead fielded gently
worded questions from the largely partisan audience. With each
response, Bush expounded at length about his plans to cut taxes,
increase military spending and improve education.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has sought to lay blame for the nation's education
problems squarely on the administration's doorstep, many educators
contend that the federal government plays a relatively minor role
in primary and secondary education. The most important decisions _
over curriculum, standards, testing, personnel and construction _
are made by state and local officials.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bush himself acknowledged the limitations of federal
action Monday, noting that Washington provides only 7 percent of
public education spending. ``It's not as if the federal government
is going to solve 100 percent of the problems,'' he said. ``The
best education is that where it's focused at the state and local
government.''
</P>
<P>
   The focus of Bush's education plan is to ensure that all
children read proficiently by the fourth grade. He would provide
aid to help primary schools expand reading programs and reward
schools that administered standardized tests annually, to help
educators diagnose learning problems early. For those and other
proposals, Bush has called for increasing federal education
spending by $47 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Schools that failed to reduce the gap in test scores between
low-income students and their more affluent peers in three years
would lose some of their federal Title I funds, which are earmarked
for low-income children. That money, $1,500 a student, would be
given directly to parents of children in failing schools, who could
use it for other educational purposes, like hiring tutors or paying
private school tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has called for increasing federal education spending by
$115 billion over 10 years to help districts build new schools,
provide preschool programs for most students, hire more teachers
and raise teacher salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush, he has proposed withholding federal aid from states
where test scores do not improve. But unlike his opponent, he would
redirect that money to the local schools with the greatest
problems, rather than give it to parents.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``education recession'' was carefully poll-tested by
the Bush campaign. Paradoxically, toward the end of his education
event, Bush was asked what could be done to help voters reconnect
with politics. He recommended that candidates not make decisions
based on polls or focus groups.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush was pitching his education ideas, his running mate,
Dick Cheney, continued his sharp attacks on Gore, accusing him of
having a conflict of interests involving stock and oil prices.
Cheney told reporters in Springfield, Ohio, that Gore supported
extending a moratorium on royalties paid by U.S. firms drilling for
natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   That position, Cheney said, would benefit Occidental Petroleum _
a company whose stock is held in a trust belonging to Gore's
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore continues to be the prospective beneficiary of holdings
of stock in Occidental Petroleum in the family trust,'' Cheney
said, ``and I think that that does constitute a conflict of
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said the vice president should either recuse himself from
participating in decisions about energy policy or ask his mother to
divest the family trust of oil stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Spell said Gore neither owned nor controlled any stock in
Occidental, and that it was unsure what stocks would be in the
family trust when he inherited them. &QL;

DRIVER WHO HIT STEPHEN KING IS DEAD OF UNKNOWN CAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRYEBURG, Maine _ In the 16 months since Bryan Smith's Dodge van
plowed into horror-writer Stephen King, shattering his bones and
sending him flying, both men's lives changed course.
</P>
<P>
   Fortified with painkillers, King returned to his desk and
angrily poured out the story of the accident, including the
impression he had, as Smith sat beside him at the side of the road,
that he had ``nearly been killed by a character out of one of my
own novels.''
</P>
<P>
   And Smith, who had been heavily medicated for back pain
following a construction injury years ago, found that hitting
Stephen King had made him strangely famous. The accident that took
place last June 19 linked one of Maine's most famous men with a
hard-luck neighbor he would never have known otherwise. But now in
a twist that spread lightening fast King has nearly recovered, and
Smith is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was found in his mobile home Friday night, tucked into his
bed, with no signs of violence or trauma, said Captain James Miclon
of the Oxford County Sheriff's office. Toxicology results of an
autopsy performed Monday probably won't be made public for another
month, he said.
</P>
<P>
   King, who had pitched a public campaign for harsher charges
against Smith, issued a brief statement saying he was ``very sorry
to hear of the passing of Bryan Smith. The death of a 43-year-old
man can only be called untimely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve felt kind of sad about the whole thing,'' added Julie
Ugley, one of King's assistants.
</P>
<P>
   King was on an afternoon walk when Smith, as King later put it,
``took from me . . . my time, my peace of mind, and my ease of
body.''
</P>
<P>
   Swiveling in his seat to restrain his Rottweiler, Pistol, Smith
veered onto the shoulder and slammed into the best-selling author
who suffered catastrophic damage to one leg, a collapsed lung, and
a broken hip, among numerous other injuries.
</P>
<P>
   As king gradually recovered _ a process he has visibily
recounted in a book and a magazine article _ he turned his
attention to Smith, excoriating his history of driving offenses and
pushing for the unusual charge of aggravated assault, which could
have resulted in a jail sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Although Smith did not go to jail, his life in Fryeburg became
more isolated after he pled guilty to the lesser charge of driving
to endanger and gave up his driving license for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said they would see him walking on crutches along the
highway, sometimes carrying armloads of groceries in hopes of
hitching a ride the six miles from his trailer to the center of
town.
</P>
<P>
   John Thompson, 65, recalled veering over to the side of the road
to where Smith was crutching along and then joking that Stephen
King had given him a thousand dollars to run him over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bryan had nothing left,'' Thompson said. ``He said something
strange to me this summer. He said, `As long a I make it through
this summer, but I'd hate to go through another winter dragging my
way up and down the highway in the snow.''
</P>
<P>
   Miclon, who found Smith's body at 9:30 Friday night said inside
the ruffled curtains the trailer home was well-kept, and that Smith
was lying so peacefully in bed that ``you would think that he was
sound asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's relatives had asked police to check on him when they did
not hear from him from for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Miclon said Smith was taking six different medicines for
constant back pain. ``There is no indication that Smith committed
suicide,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's family members, including a brother who is a police
officer in Fryeburg, refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment that Smith's van struck King last summer the
accident's aftermath was colored by the author's massive
international following.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Silver, King's attroney, purchased the van from Smith in
order to keep it out of the hands of curiosity seekers who were
already calling in bids. Media interest flared up within hours and
never seemed to abate _ nearly five months later NBC's Dateline was
still seeking the release of the 911 tapes for the afternoon King
was injured.
</P>
<P>
   But here in Maine, locals soon began to complain that Smith was
being harshly punished because he happened to hit a celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Smith's lawyer complained that because of King's
enormous popularity he couldn't get a fair trial anywhere in Oxford
County. And several neighbors interviewed said they had never
shaken the suspicion that King was throwing his weight around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been with the department for 24 years, and I had more
local people _ everyday Joes who go to work everyday _ siding with
Smith than were siding with King,'' Miclon said. ``I think that's
Maine.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Carl Magee, who attended local schools with some of
Smith's siblings, angrily pointed out a headline announcing the
death of the ``driver in accident that injured Stephen King.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could go out in five minutes and run ober a little kid _ it
could happen to anyone of us,'' said Magee, who is 62. ``All I`m
saying is with an average Joe none of this would have happened. But
Stephen King is on national TV, he's pissing and moaning and
whining.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he was injured in a construction accident, Smith had been
a skilled woodworker, who wore his sideburns long, fashioning
himself after Elvis Presley when his peer group was interested in
disco.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Smith had brought a girlfriend by Thompson's house to
show off a table he had built years ago out of a wooden sign.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before it he held out his hands and told her he hadn't
always been a cripple.
</P>
<P>
   What Thompson's companion Sue remembers, though, is a phone call
from Smith in the early morning hours, begging her to bring him
more pain medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if Stephen King can even begin to see what it is to
live with that kind of pain,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But most locals interviewed seemed to agree that Smith's brief
celebrity is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think outside of Maine, within a month or so, people will be
saying, `What the heck is the name of that guy who hit Stephen
King?' '' Miclon said.

TROUBLE FOLLOWS BOSTON ROCK GROUP 
</HEADLINE>

 By JOHN ELLEMENT AND MARCELLA BOMBARDIERI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Made Men seems to be ever in the wrong place, at
the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   It was early Monday morning when Celtics star Paul Pierce was
stabbed outside a nightclub. Rush hour had barely ended when a
Boston police spokeswoman went on live television and said police
were looking into whether the Made Men, a local rap act _ or their
associates _ were responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The stabbing is still under investigation, and it's unclear
whether the members of the group are instigators, suspects,
scapegoats, or perhaps all of the above. What is clear is this:
where the Made Men go, trouble follows.
</P>
<P>
   The stabbing is the latest in the long and troubled history of
Made Men, which has its roots in the city's ethnic Roxbury and
Mattapan sections, and was once known as Almighty RSO, or just RSO.
</P>
<P>
   Their difficulties stretch back to 1991, when group member
Rodney Pitts was stabbed to death in a nightclub brawl, and are as
recent as April, when five people _ including Made Men member Marco
Ennis _ were stabbed after a backstage fight at the FleetCenter.
Police blame Made Men for instigating the brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, however, the group vehemently denied any
involvement in Pierce's stabbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can say absolutely that Made Men had nothing to do with the
melee that took place (Sunday) night,'' said group member Raymond
``Ray Dog'' Scott in a statement. ``We do not condone or advocate
violence against anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott and Ennis were both at the party, held after a hairstyle
and fashion show at Symphony Hall, according to the group. A third
member, Anthony Grant, was in New Jersey at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Made Men has achieved some national success, and its lawyer,
John Swomley, insists its members are artists and legitimate
businessmen. They hold a financial stake in the rap/hip hop
magazine The Source and other entertainment ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Swomley also said police seem to have a grudge against Made Men.
``Generically, there is a desire on the part of the Boston Police
Department to talk (about Made Men) whenever something goes
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Made Men has never gotten along with law enforcement. In the
early 1990s, Boston police threatened to sue them over suggestive,
cop-killer lyrics. Last June, Scott said two Braintree police
officers manhandled him and sprayed him with pepper spray when
questioning his credit card purchases at the South Shore Plaza
shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   Police went to the mall after Macy's employees reported that two
black men were purchasing thousands of dollars of merchandise with
an American Express Gold Card.
</P>
<P>
   The officers were charged with assault but an all-white jury
acquitted them in District Court in July.
</P>
<P>
   One officer, John Ouelette, said Scott was abusive, but Scott,
35, of Easton, said Macy's and the officers didn't believe an
African-American man would have access to a premium credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Frank J. McGee, the lawyer who defended Ouelette, also
threatened to sue Almight RSO in 1992 on behalf of the Boston
police officer's union for their single, ``One in the Chamba,''
arguing that it advocated the use of violence against police.
</P>
<P>
   The song told the story of two young men shot and killed by
Boston police officers, and included the phrase ``keeping one in
the chamba'' _ a reference to a cocked, loaded gun kept as
protection against police.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit never materialized, but Almight RSO was dropped by
its record label at the time, Tommy Boy Records, a subsidiary of
Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Like many rap groups with tough-guy images, Made Men was founded
by streetwise young men. News reports have said that gang members
from several housing projects created Almighty RSO and built the
group's reputation on tapes they produced themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, group member Rodney Pitts, just 17, was fatally stabbed
during a fracas at the Gallery, a popular Roxbury nightclub, a few
years after a bodyguard for the group was gunned down, according to
news accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Gallery club manager Michael Adams was shot to death;
friends said he was involved in the fight that ended in Pitts'
death and had been the target of death threats since then. He was
not indicted for Pitts' murder.
</P>
<P>
   Only one person was charged after the April FleetCenter
backstage brawl during the Ruff Ryders/Cash Money Tour, but police
focused on Made Men. The group denied culpability; ``We don't want
no problems,'' Scott said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Some hip hop Internet chatrooms have suggested Made Men were
involved in a fight that broke out last month during the taping of
The Source awards show in Pasadena, California, but police said
there apparently is no connection.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the group's musical success seems tied to its renegade,
street-smart image, and its scrapes with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Rolling Stone wrote that Made Men's latest album
``showcases the personal growth of a group that has survived more
than its share of grief, including a lousy industry reputation
(possibly deserved) and the death of two members . . . Made Men
have proved that sometimes in hip-hop, there is life after death.''

 &HT;    Piper Aircraft sued for $75 million
 &HT;    By Amy Martinez
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - The New Piper Aircraft Inc. of Vero
Beach, Fla., faces a $75 million lawsuit over a faulty engine part
in the Malibu Mirage, a sleek six-seat airplane billed by the
company as ``perfection.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed last week in U.S. District Court in Fort Pierce,
targets Piper and the plane's engine manufacturer, Textron Lycoming
of Williamsport, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff, Dallas businessman William Montgomery, contends
Piper and Textron knew about the engine problem for several years
and did nothing about it, jeopardizing safety and costing owners
hundreds of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Though no one was killed, four plane crashes in the past four
years were caused by the problem _ a lead alloy in a rod bearing
that melts when the engine heats up, said one of Montgomery's
attorneys, Charles Ames of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Textron last month acknowledged a problem with the engine's rod
bearing and offered to replace it starting in October, but Ames
said Mirage owners deserve at least $75 million for maintenance
expenses, lost flying time, alternative travel costs and lower
resale values.
</P>
<P>
   Mirage owners are supposed to be able to fly 2,000 hours before
overhauling the engine but instead are averaging about 600 to 700
hours, said Ames, part of a team that includes Fred Misko of Dallas
and Michael Pucillo of West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys are seeking class action status for the suit.
</P>
<P>
   An engine replacement costs about $95,000, plus six weeks of
down time, Ames said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you buy something that you think will go for 2,000 hours
and it only goes 600 or 700 hours, you've lost two-thirds of what
you bought,'' Ames said Monday from his Dallas office. ``The owner
is taking a huge financial loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The single-engine Malibu Mirage, which lists for $869,800, is
popular with business travelers because of its ability to fly at an
altitude of 25,000 feet _ uncommonly high for a single-engine
airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Piper's Web site bills it as ``Perfection: It's no illusion,
it's a mirage.''
</P>
<P>
   Since production began in 1987, Piper has built and sold about
465 Malibu Mirages, the suit states.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,200 past and current owners could be eligible for
compensation if damages are awarded, Ames said.
</P>
<P>
   Piper President and Chief Executive Chuck Suma was unavailable
for comment Monday. The company said in a press release: ``Textron
Lycoming, with New Piper's participation, has addressed and is
currently resolving all known component issues. New Piper is
committed to manufacturing safe and airworthy products and
maintains that the Malibu Mirage is a safe and reliable aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Piper, a privately held company with 1,400 employees, did $146
million in revenue last year and expects to do $200 million this
year.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of past and current Mirage owners, accounting for 111
planes, found that there were 60 in-flight engine failures, 66
premature engine overhauls, 46 instances of metal in the oil and 32
replaced engines, the suit claims.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery filed suit after participating in an initial survey
last spring by Enhanced Flight Group of Lexington, Ky., which
uncovered similar complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Pilot Jonathan Sisk ran into problems with his Mirage and
started Enhanced Flight Group this year on the theory that he could
make better engine parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Responses to our survey came back a lot more negative than we
anticipated, and it put us in a funny situation,'' said Sisk, who
also owns an electronics manufacturing business in Lexington.
``What we initially tried to find out is whether there's enough of
a problem to warrant a business venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the issue is: Do we want to be involved in any way in this
engine?''

TROUBLE FOLLOWS BOSTON ROCK GROUP 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Made Men seems to be ever in the wrong place, at
the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   It was early Monday morning when Celtics star Paul Pierce was
stabbed outside a nightclub. Rush hour had barely ended when a
Boston police spokeswoman went on live television and said police
were looking into whether the Made Men, a local rap act _ or their
associates _ were responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The stabbing is still under investigation, and it's unclear
whether the members of the group are instigators, suspects,
scapegoats, or perhaps all of the above. What is clear is this:
where the Made Men go, trouble follows.
</P>
<P>
   The stabbing is the latest in the long and troubled history of
Made Men, which has its roots in the city's ethnic Roxbury and
Mattapan sections, and was once known as Almighty RSO, or just RSO.
</P>
<P>
   Their difficulties stretch back to 1991, when group member
Rodney Pitts was stabbed to death in a nightclub brawl, and are as
recent as April, when five people _ including Made Men member Marco
Ennis _ were stabbed after a backstage fight at the FleetCenter.
Police blame Made Men for instigating the brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, however, the group vehemently denied any
involvement in Pierce's stabbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can say absolutely that Made Men had nothing to do with the
melee that took place (Sunday) night,'' said group member Raymond
``Ray Dog'' Scott in a statement. ``We do not condone or advocate
violence against anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott and Ennis were both at the party, held after a hairstyle
and fashion show at Symphony Hall, according to the group. A third
member, Anthony Grant, was in New Jersey at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Made Men has achieved some national success, and its lawyer,
John Swomley, insists its members are artists and legitimate
businessmen. They hold a financial stake in the rap/hip hop
magazine The Source and other entertainment ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Swomley also said police seem to have a grudge against Made Men.
``Generically, there is a desire on the part of the Boston Police
Department to talk (about Made Men) whenever something goes
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Made Men has never gotten along with law enforcement. In the
early 1990s, Boston police threatened to sue them over suggestive,
cop-killer lyrics. Last June, Scott said two Braintree police
officers manhandled him and sprayed him with pepper spray when
questioning his credit card purchases at the South Shore Plaza
shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   Police went to the mall after Macy's employees reported that two
black men were purchasing thousands of dollars of merchandise with
an American Express Gold Card.
</P>
<P>
   The officers were charged with assault but an all-white jury
acquitted them in District Court in July.
</P>
<P>
   One officer, John Ouelette, said Scott was abusive, but Scott,
35, of Easton, said Macy's and the officers didn't believe an
African-American man would have access to a premium credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Frank J. McGee, the lawyer who defended Ouelette, also
threatened to sue Almight RSO in 1992 on behalf of the Boston
police officer's union for their single, ``One in the Chamba,''
arguing that it advocated the use of violence against police.
</P>
<P>
   The song told the story of two young men shot and killed by
Boston police officers, and included the phrase ``keeping one in
the chamba'' _ a reference to a cocked, loaded gun kept as
protection against police.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit never materialized, but Almight RSO was dropped by
its record label at the time, Tommy Boy Records, a subsidiary of
Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Like many rap groups with tough-guy images, Made Men was founded
by streetwise young men. News reports have said that gang members
from several housing projects created Almighty RSO and built the
group's reputation on tapes they produced themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, group member Rodney Pitts, just 17, was fatally stabbed
during a fracas at the Gallery, a popular Roxbury nightclub, a few
years after a bodyguard for the group was gunned down, according to
news accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Gallery club manager Michael Adams was shot to death;
friends said he was involved in the fight that ended in Pitts'
death and had been the target of death threats since then. He was
not indicted for Pitts' murder.
</P>
<P>
   Only one person was charged after the April FleetCenter
backstage brawl during the Ruff Ryders/Cash Money Tour, but police
focused on Made Men. The group denied culpability; ``We don't want
no problems,'' Scott said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Some hip hop Internet chatrooms have suggested Made Men were
involved in a fight that broke out last month during the taping of
The Source awards show in Pasadena, California, but police said
there apparently is no connection.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the group's musical success seems tied to its renegade,
street-smart image, and its scrapes with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Rolling Stone wrote that Made Men's latest album
``showcases the personal growth of a group that has survived more
than its share of grief, including a lousy industry reputation
(possibly deserved) and the death of two members . . . Made Men
have proved that sometimes in hip-hop, there is life after death.''

ANALYSIS: INTERNATIONAL LENDERS' NEW IMAGE: A HUMAN FACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ Deepa Narayan, a Indian woman with a
steely gaze who spends much of her time in the poorest villages on
earth, speaks of power, voice and equality as the keys to ending
poverty. Keeping men from beating women does far more to raise
living standards than any dam project ever did, she argues.
</P>
<P>
   She would make a fine spokeswoman for the demonstrators who plan
to blockade World Bank and International Monetary Fund officials in
their hotels here Tuesday, when they hope to send a message that
global lending agencies hurt the poor.
</P>
<P>
   But Narayan, 48, works for the World Bank, and seems to like it
there. And therein lies one of messages emerging from the meetings
here: the World Bank and the International Monetary fund are
successfully repelling the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Like those who disrupted the World Trade Organization's meeting
in Seattle last year and the bank and the fund's meeting in
Washington last spring, the protesters here view the World Bank and
the monetary fund as retrograde institutions that carry water for
multinational corporations. But increasingly the protesters are
aiming stationary cannons at moving targets. The bank and the fund
are, by the standards of huge bureaucracies, changing quickly,
largely because of outside pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Narayan just completed a two-year, two-volume survey of
20,000 people who live on less than $1 a day. She and others at the
bank say the study is one of several revolutionizing who gets the
bank's $30 billion in loans each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some of the protests have been helpful in bringing
about changes,'' Narayan said on the sideline of the bank's annual
meetings here Monday. ``But they are also worrying. You can destroy
overnight what has taken so long to build.''
</P>
<P>
   Narayan's study, called ``Voices of the Poor,'' is one example
of how James D. Wolfensohn, has tried to reinvent poverty programs.
But equally telling is how he and Horst Kohler, the German who
heads the IMF, have cast themselves as allies of governments and
charity groups in poor countries, sometimes taking stands against
the rich nations that provide most of their funding.
</P>
<P>
   The Prague meetings may be remembered among globalization
experts as the time when the two institutions, so much under
attack, managed to gain some footing. Their tormentors on the
streets, always at a disadvantage because of their small budgets
and mixed messages, seem to be taking the blows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolfensohn and Kohler have become extremely important allies
for us,'' said Trevor A. Manuel, South Africa's finance minister
and the chairman of the Prague meetings. ``Our real problem is the
U.S., Britain and France. The protesters seem not to understand
these things.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the reluctance of the rich nations,
especially the U.S. Congress, to provide more money to the bank and
the fund that could be used to relieve the old debts of developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel also criticized the reluctance of industrial countries to
share power at the two lending agencies. Wolfesohn and Kohler have
quietly pushed ministers of wealthy nations, especially Europeans,
to give up some of their voting power.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics are actually spending more time inside Prague's
Congress Center than on the streets this year. Kohler and
Wolfensohn gave entry passes to some 300 charity and watchdog
groups so that they could attend the annual meetings, and the
outreach seems to be working. Many protesters now call the two
lending agencies potential friends or, at worst, ciphers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are civil servants,'' says Ann Pettifor, organizer of the
Jubilee 2000 coalition of debt-relief groups, said of Wolfensohn
and Kohler. ``We know who the bad guys are. It's the G-7,''
referring to the seven most-developed nations.
</P>
<P>
   To some outside protesters, a mix of anarchists, Marxists,
student activists and environmentalists, this is a distinction
without a difference. But their lack of discrimination is a
handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Their main protest event is scheduled for Tuesday, when the bank
and the fund hold their formal meeting ceremonies. The G-7
ministers, including Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers,
attended their sessions Saturday at the German embassy here
unhindered. Some top ministers have already left town.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The bank and the IMF, along with the World Trade Organization,
make appealing protest targets. They are symbols of globalization
because they are supra national. Their leaders are hand-picked, not
elected, and they have historically been secretive. They make tens
of billions of dollars of loans each year.
</P>
<P>
   They are accountable to nations who are members, rich ones most
of all, but also poor ones. And, like any bureaucracy, they are
scrambling to survive in a new era, making themselves imperfect
proxies for multinational corporations or other presumed forces of
evil.
</P>
<P>
   Take Kohler, the new managing director at the fund. He took over
the reins of the Washington-based monetary fund at perhaps the
low-point of its reputation last spring, when it was under attack
for mismanaging bailouts in Asia and Russia in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly departed on what he called a listening tour of 16
developing countries and when he returned he began talking about
changes in how the fund makes loans. He says he will streamline the
much-criticized conditions its attaches to its money.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when the fund provided $40 billion in emergency
financing to Jakarta during the Asian crisis, it attached a list of
more than 100 conditions. It required, for example, that the
government disband its clove monopoly and eliminate price subsidies
on basic foodstuffs, seen as ways of using the lending as leverage
to move the country toward a free market.
</P>
<P>
   Kohler said the conditions went too far, alienating Indonesians.
``I will not have another Indonesia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also agreed to eliminate a requirement the fund had imposed
on Mozambique. There, fund officials had told the government to
eliminate import tariffs on sugar, which the government had imposed
to help the troubled industry. Kohler now says he will no longer
force developing nations to implement trade liberalization that
rich countries like the United States or those in Europe have no
yet undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   At the World Bank, Wolfensohn routinely points out that almost
half the world's population lives on less than $2 a day. He readily
admits that many of the bank`s traditional clients have not done
much to improve the lives of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wolfensohn is a former investment banker, he is proving
hard to outflank on the left. He gave Narayan's team of economists
latitude to write what the bank calls its World Development Report,
a flagship document that _ after much internal debate _ threw
stones at the orthodox temple of development economics by
challenging the notion that all loans should aim to stimulate
growth. Freeing trade, privatizing government companies, and
limiting government spending were once seen as main ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   The latest report does not attack those ideas. Instead it
focuses on ``empowering'' poor people, addressing dysfunctional
family structures, and cutting government middlemen out of aid
distribution. It reads like something written by people Wolfensohn
himself once described as the ``Berkeley Mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   Bank officials promise that their loan portfolio will look
radically different in five years, reflecting the report's new
priorities. But it already looks quite different than it did when
Wolfensohn took power five years ago when the bank spent one in
five of its aid dollars on electrical infrastructure projects.
Today that ratio is one in fifty.
</P>
<P>
   This year the bank is spending hundreds of millions of dollars
to fight AIDS and malaria. It has begun a $500 million pilot
program in Indonesia examining how to channel aid directly to
villages where poor people live, rather than entrusting authorities
to do that for them.
</P>
<P>
   All this talk raises pressure on the bank and the fund to make
far more progress in fighting poverty over the next ten years than
they made during the past decade, when living conditions for the
poor in Africa, the former Soviet Union and much of Latin American
actually deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   But now, at least, the protesters have worthy challengers in the
battle for public opinion.

<P>
   RAMLE, Israel _ Calling a young man up to the stage, Rabbi
Yehuda Deri beamed as the youth was draped in a prayer shawl and
vowed to become an observant Jew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blessed are you, Lord, for letting us live to reach this
moment,'' the young man recited as a hearty ``Amen'' went up from
the crowd in a tent set up here in a dusty lot outside Maasiyahu
Prison. Other young men followed in turn, taking the stage to
commit themselves to the faith.
</P>
<P>
   The prison holds Rabbi Deri's brother, Aryeh Deri, the
charismatic leader of the strictly Orthodox Shas Party of Sephardic
Jews who was sent to prison on Sept. 3 for corruption. Since then
the area near the jail has mushroomed into a pilgrimage site where
hundreds _ and sometimes thousands _ of people gather nightly for
the Jewish equivalent of a religious revival meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The gatherings have taken on a life of their own, drawing mostly
Sephardic Jews of Middle Eastern and North African origin, many
from economically depressed communities. There are newly religious
young men and people who are already strictly Orthodox, as well as
the nonobservant.
</P>
<P>
   Every night men, women and children stream to the prison area in
a demonstration of ethnic resentment and religious fervor that
echoes the discontents of Israel's underclass.
</P>
<P>
   To them Deri is a Sephardic martyr, his imprisonment the latest
example of oppression by a secular elite of European background.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've realized that I'm a stranger in my own country,'' said
Hillel Tzabari, 50, of Ramat Gan.
</P>
<P>
   The nightly meetings, which include prayer, sermons and song,
seem to offer many who take part the solace of faith, resembling
pilgrimages to tombs of holy men across Israel, where people pray
for divine help to heal sickness, find a spouse or bear children.
</P>
<P>
   Deri himself has been transformed by his followers into
something of a saint, a suffering servant of the Torah whose mere
presence in a nearby cell has already worked wonders. ``Every day
that he's there, people are returning to religion,'' said a woman
from Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes near the jail, which have also drawn strictly
Orthodox Ashkenazic Jews of European origin, have led some experts
to suggest that something new is in the making, inspired by Deri's
imprisonment but reflecting broad undercurrents in Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a grass-roots religious movement that goes beyond
Shas, that unites various people who reject Israeliness, with its
secular modernism,'' said Avirama Golan, who writes about religious
politics for the newspaper Haaretz.
</P>
<P>
   The lines have been drawn more sharply in recent weeks as a
public debate has grown over proposals by Prime Minister Ehud Barak
to push through a ``civil reform'' program that would remove
constraints of religious law from various aspects of public life.
</P>
<P>
   His suggestions include speeding up legislation for a
constitution, which Israel has never had, as well as sanctioning
civil marriages and running bus and national airline services on
the Jewish Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   Menachem Friedman of Bar-Ilan University, an expert on radical
religious movements, said the people drawn to the gatherings near
Deri's prison were from parts of Israeli society that felt
economically marginalized and overtaken by Israel's increasingly
globalized culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The huge growth in social gaps in Israel has left these people
at a dead end,'' he said. ``They feel left behind, that their
identity has been erased. ``They're saying, `We have a home, we
have warmth, we have togetherness and we have a face _ we're not
just anybody.'''
</P>
<P>
   The lot outside the jail, a makeshift yeshiva by day, was
transformed into a religious bazaar on a recent night. Peddlers
hawked cassettes of rabbinical sermons and religious books, charms,
amulets, candles, bottles of oil, posters of revered rabbis,
skullcaps for men and hats for women, and even electrical
appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting next to a Torah scroll strung with flashing lights, a
man urged people to sign up to sponsor the copying of a new scroll
in honor of Deri. On the main stage, a prayer leader led
recitations for the penitential Jewish month of Elul, and speakers
praised Deri and exhorted the crowd to pray for his speedy release.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can feel the sacredness of this place,'' said Meir Levy,
from Ramle. ``After work you come right here without even going
home. It pulls you like a magnet.''
</P>
<P>
   Shlomo Vaknin, a soldier on leave sporting a big white skullcap,
said he had become a regular at the nightly gatherings although he
was not an observant Jew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm slowly getting close to Judaism, feeling more comfortable
with it, more whole,'' he said. ``There are no class differences
here. People treat each other with respect.''
</P>
<P>
   David Cohen, an unemployed drug addict from nearby Lod, said he
had come to get help. ``I want to listen to words of Torah, to get
stronger and to find someone who can refer me to a rehabilitation
program,'' he said. Later, he was brought on stage to proclaim his
return to religion.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Nissim, a newly religious follower of the 19th-century
Hasidic rabbi Nachman of Bratslav, said the meetings brought people
together. ``I like the unity here, Ashkenazic and Sephardic Jews,
strictly Orthodox with secular people,'' he said. ``You see the
people of Israel getting close to the Creator.''

AOL CLOSE TO DEAL WITH JAPANESE MOBILE INTERNET COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKI TANIKAWA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ NTT DoCoMo Inc., the largest mobile communications
company in Japan, confirmed Monday that is in advanced talks about
an alliance with America Online. A deal could greatly expand AOL's
presence in Japan, where it has made little headway since
introducing its services here three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   NTT DoCoMo has attracted 12 million subscribers in Japan to its
service, known as i-mode, which allows users to gain access to the
Internet from their mobile phones. AOL, by contrast, has attracted
400,000 to 500,000 users.
</P>
<P>
   A tie-in would give AOL greater access to the Japanese market,
where computer-based use of the Internet is minimal compared with
that in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hooking up with DoCoMo allows them to quickly gain a lot of
users in this market,'' said Kevin Williams, a senior analyst with
IDC Japan, ``since DoCoMo is the dominant player and the effects
are immediate.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL officials declined to comment, but NTT DoCoMo confirmed that
both companies were in the advance stages of negotiations.
``Anything could change in the final stages,'' DoCoMo said through
a spokesman. ``So we cannot discuss this at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   An imminent deal was first reported on Friday in a Japanese
daily, Sankei Shimbun, which said that DoCoMo would acquire a stake
of at least 40 percent in AOL Japan, a joint venture between
America Online and a partnership of two Japanese companies _ the
huge trading house Mitsui and the financial news publisher Nihon
Keizai Shimbun.
</P>
<P>
   AOL Japan has fared badly since it was formed here in 1997. The
current subscriber base trails far behind the nearly four million
customers of a Fujitsu subsidiary, the Nifty Corp., the leader
among Internet service providers in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Whether there are any immediate benefits to DoCoMo from an
alliance with AOL is not clear. While DoCoMo would gain access to
AOL's content, the Japanese company already has other ways to get
content for its i-mode service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to play with DoCoMo, not the other way
around,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Longer term, a DoCoMo linkup with AOL could prove enormously
useful to the Japanese company in its effort to expand
internationally. The alliance would ``bring DoCoMo a lot of
exposure to AOL customers in the U.S.,'' Williams said. ``A lot of
consumers in the U.S. don't know much about DoCoMo. With this deal,
it brings i-mode services and other DoCoMo services out in the open
and could potentially accelerate the introduction of i-mode type
services in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Sankei Shimbun said the two companies also agreed to establish a
joint venture in the United States as part of a wider accord for
cooperation on matters relating to wireless access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The wireless Internet has taken off in Japan, and DoCoMo's
expertise is considered a valuable resource for other companies
seeking to expand their wireless presence.

 &HT;    Bengals' head coach leaves mess behind
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Unable to raise the sunken Bengals from the bottom
of the NFL, Bruce Coslet resigned as head coach in an emotional
farewell meeting with team president Mike Brown on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Brown then appointed 63-year-old defensive coordinator Dick
LeBeau as the eighth head coach of the Bengals the day after a 37-0
loss at Baltimore, that equals the largest margin of defeat in the
franchise's 33-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Bengals radio analyst Dave Lapham reported that Brown first
offered the job to linebackers coach Mark Duffner, who rejected it
in a show of support for LeBeau. Club officials didn't deny
Lapham's claim.
</P>
<P>
   LeBeau becomes the NFL's oldest rookie head coach since 1970. A
pair of 62-year-olds _ Bud Wilkinson of the St. Louis Cardinals and
Rod Rust of the New England Patriots _ broke into the league in
1978 and 1990, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   What Coslet couldn't do _ turn around a team that owns a 43-104
record since 1991 and is off to its fifth 0-3 start in that span _
LeBeau is eager to try.
</P>
<P>
   LeBeau said offensive coordinator Ken Anderson will call the
offensive plays and Duffner, a former college head coach at Holy
Cross and Maryland, will help him run the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches and I recognize the challenge that's in front of
us,'' LeBeau said during an afternoon news conference at Paul Brown
Stadium. ``It's an honor to be charged with that responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a difficult day. It is not a particular happy day, but
nonetheless we welcome this challenge. We think we can be a great
part of the solution. I expect our players to play hard and
spirited, and I think you will see a spirited team.''
</P>
<P>
   LeBeau said he spoke with Coslet and tried to talk him out of a
resignation that ends his 24-year stay with the team _ eight as a
player (1969-76) and 16 as a coach. ``But he was not to be
swayed,'' LeBeau said. ``I was totally shocked by this. As a
friend, my heart goes out to him. He's a tremendous coach and a
tremendous man.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is done is done. Bruce understands that. Our task is to
look forward from this day and to build this team back to where
it's competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Coslet's spirit was broken after the loss at Baltimore dropped
his record to 21-39. He went 7-2 as Dave Shula's replacement in
1996, but steadily went downhill: 7-9 in '97, 3-13 in '98, 4-12 in
'99 and 0-3 in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the Ravens ``thrashed us every way imaginable. It was
hard for our people. It was hard for Bruce. This was a rock-bottom
occasion, and when I walked into the locker room after the game, he
said to me: `Could I talk with you first thing (Monday) morning?' I
said `yes.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a pretty good idea of what he had in mind, but I wasn't
sure that after he thought about it all night that he would look on
it any differently (Monday) morning,'' Brown added. ``When I met
with him, he simply offered his resignation and I accepted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt that coaching was harder on him than it was meant to
be. That it wasn't clear that he could do for the team what needed
to be done and he decided he should leave. He was apologetic to me
for leaving in the middle of the season, and it was hard for me
because he's a good man, a good friend and a good coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very emotional, personal conversation. There wasn't a
lot exchanged in words. But I appreciate what he has done and what
he has gone through. He gave it his best effort. No one can
question that.''
</P>
<P>
   Coslet couldn't be reached Monday at his Butler County home. He
had left the complex before the afternoon news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing he said was he had no plans,'' Brown said. ``He
needs some time to step back and think about his situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown broke the news to the players in a meeting and LeBeau put
the team on alert to be ready for practice on Wednesday for the
Miami Dolphins at home on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten to the point that this (losing) has to stop,''
right guard Mike Goff said. ``It's as simple as that. He basically
said that it's going to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   LeBeau, a native of London, Ohio, and an Ohio State University
star from 1954-57, spent 1959-72 as a cornerback for the Detroit
Lions. He played in 171 straight NFL games, was voted to three Pro
Bowls and is tied for sixth on the league's all-time interceptions
list with 62.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anyone with the Bengals who is more knowledgable
about football,'' Brown said about LeBeau. ``He can talk to players
in a way they understand he's a good teacher. I think he can step
in now and take our situation and get it back on course as quickly
as anybody could. But it isn't going to be an easy challenge for
him and we're fully aware of how difficult it will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has our confidence. He has the confidence of his fellow
coaches and of the players as well.''
</P>
<P>
   LeBeau has a reputation for being quiet and laid-back, but he's
intense and serious about his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen very animated coaches. I've seen seen very
introverted coaches and both types be very successful,'' LeBeau
said. ``I don't know that my particular personality will have any
bearing other than how the players react to me, which I think will
be positive. I'm positive of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Are the Bengals better than they play?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question about that,'' LeBeau said.
``We're going to answer that on the field. Hopefully, what happened
to us Sunday will not happen to us again, and you'll begin to see a
much more competitive performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 0-3. I think there are accountability issues at every
phase, coaching and playing. There will be some changes. I was a
player for 14 years. I've coached in this league for 28 years. That
adds up to 42, so I think I have some ideas. We are in the process
of formulating those.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we have a good talented young football team. We've
got to look at all the reasons why we're not getting it done.''

   Tonight is the weakest night of prime-time programming. The
day's most compelling event will be on NBC's morning show at 10
a.m. when it airs the surging U.S. team in the gold medal softball
game against Japan. There will be gymnastics tonight, but it's the
just-for-fun performances known as the Champions' Gala. The serious
competition will be in men's springboard diving with Mark Ruiz as
the top American; in weightlifting where Shane Hamman's attempt to
medal in the super heavyweight final will be shown; and in the duet
finals of synchronized swimming. There's also an interesting
feature called ''Blood in the Pool,'' which revisits the fiercely
contested Hungary-Soviet Union water polo match during the 1956
Melbourne Games, a showdown for the gold that took place just three
weeks after the Soviets invaded Hungary. MSNBC (TV 33) will have
tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams in a doubles match against
Belgium; the U.S. vs. Korea in baseball with a berth in the
gold-medal game on the line; the surprising men's U.S. soccer team
in the semifinals against Spain; and Americans Dain Blanton and
Eric Fonoimoana going for the gold in beach volleyball.

U.S. RULES KENNEWICK MAN'S BONES BELONG TO INDIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore.)   By TIMOTHY EGAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Moving to resolve a custody battle over one of the
oldest and most significant set of human remains ever found in
North America, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt Monday announced
that the bones of Kennewick Man belong to five American Indians
tribes that claim him as an ancestor and wish to bury him.
</P>
<P>
   The bones, estimated to be about 9,300 years old, were
discovered four years ago in a mud bank of the Columbia River. They
quickly became a source of archaeological contention after several
scientists who initially examined the skeleton said its features
were closer to people who once lived in Europe or Asia. It raised
the possibility that Europeans or Asians lived in North America
before many of the tribes inhabited the land.
</P>
<P>
   The tribes have sought to control the bones under a federal law,
the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, that
requires skeletal remains to be turned over to people who can show
a geographic or cultural affiliation with them.
</P>
<P>
   A group of scientists filed suit in Portland, Ore., seeking to
block repatriation and saying that a treasure trove of information
about the lives of ancient Americans would be lost if the bones
were turned over to the Indians. That lawsuit could be resolved in
the next year.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision Monday, Babbitt appeared to bypass the
conclusions of a panel of scientists who were assigned by the court
to determine the ethnic origins of Kennewick Man. That panel said
the remains resembled those of people from Asia, particularly the
Ainu of northern Japan, and Polynesians from southern Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said he based his decision on the Indian grave
repatriation law. First, he said the tribes were able to
demonstrate some cultural affiliation with the bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although ambiguities in the data made this a close call, I was
persuaded by the geographic data and oral histories of the five
tribes,'' said Babbitt.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the tribes were able to demonstrate that the land
where the bones were found has been an aboriginal home for the five
tribes seeking Kennewick Man. ``These tribes,'' he said, ``have
inhabitated, hunted and fished this area around the confluence of
the Columbia and Snake Rivers for millennia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous victory _ a big win,'' said Armand Minthorn,
a member of the governing board of the Umatilla Nation, one of five
tribes claiming the bones. ``It just can't be expressed how much
this means to us culturally.''
</P>
<P>
   The bones are currently being held in the Burke Museum in
Seattle, where they are likely to remain until the litigation is
over. But if Babbitt's decision is upheld by the courts, Kennewick
Man would be given a proper burial as a sacred ancestor, said
Minthorn.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt's decision was criticized by some of the scientists who
want to further study the bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they would have allowed us to study the skeleton when they
first discovered it, this thing would be over by now,'' said Alan
Schneider, an attorney for the scientists who are suing for access
to the bones.
</P>
<P>
   In the four years since Kennewick Man was discovered, the bones
have obtained icon status by some self-professed Pagan groups who
said the discovery was evidence of early European habitation in the
United States.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several political leaders in the Northwest said the case
demonstrated a need to change the Indian graves act, saying it was
too broad.
</P>
<P>
   Although they were never able to place the bones with any one
ethnic group, the scientists who studied Kennewick Man provided
additional fodder for the debate over how the Americas were first
peopled.
</P>
<P>
   By tracing the bones to Asian and Pacific Islander groups with a
long maritime heritage, the scientists bolstered the case that some
of the first Americans may have come by boat, crossing the Pacific
or following islands north of Japan to the Bering Sea and then
south along the West Coast.

   SYDNEY, Australia -- Cathy Freeman gladdened the hearts and
soothed the souls of a nation. Michael Johnson capped a solid-gold
international career. And Stacy Dragila set a lofty standard for
women's pole vaulting.
</P>
<P>
   It was a wildly bipolar day for track and field at the Sydney
Olympics on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After depressing revelations early in the day of a positive drug
test by U.S. shot putter C.J. Hunter, the husband of American
superstar Marion Jones, the athletes put on a rousing show before
another capacity crowd of 110,000 at Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman's victory in the women's 400-meter dash was the
feel-good story of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, an Aborigine, has become a sort of an icon of
rapprochement between Australia's white majority and its native
peoples. She was chosen to light the Olympic cauldron and her
competition was eagerly anticipated by Australians of all creeds
and hues.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I did and what I symbolize will make a difference in a
lot of people's attitudes,'' she said. ``All I know is I made a lot
of people happy of all kinds of backgrounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman pulled away to win her event in 49.11 seconds, setting
off a loud and long celebration among the overwhelmingly Australian
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could feel the crowd all around me, all over me,'' she said.
``I could feel everybody's emotion. Happiness and joy absorbed into
every pore of my body.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman's gold was the 100th in Australian Olympic history and
the first individual gold for an Aborigine. She carried the
Australian and Aboriginal flags in a victory lap of the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Johnson became the first man to win consecutive
gold medals in the 400, churning to the wire in 43.84 seconds, well
ahead of teammate Alvin Harrison (44.40).
</P>
<P>
   In his remarkable career, Johnson has never finished anything
but first in individual competition at the Olympics and World
Championships. He has nine gold medals in those events.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of pressure,'' said Johnson, 32. ``I had
the opportunity to make history. I mean, no bronze, no silver. This
is my last major competition. I was here to defend my last
individual race in the Olympic Games. This Olympics is special,
because it's my last.''
</P>
<P>
   He plans one more race, in the 4x400 relay on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Dragila became the first Olympic women's pole vault champion,
clearing 15 feet, 1 inch. Dragila, the world-record holder at
15-2\, survived the challenge of Australia's Tatiana Grigorieva,
who topped out at 14-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be on the victory stand at the Olympics ... I was an
average athlete when I decided to pick up a pole seven years ago
and dedicate myself to the pole vault and hope it would become an
Olympic event,'' said Dragila, a former rodeo goat-roper. ``And
then to win the first gold ...''
</P>
<P>
   For a time, news that Hunter failed an IAAF drug test from an
event in Norway in July cast a pall over the day and created a
cloud over Jones' bid to win five gold medals here.
</P>
<P>
   USA Track and Field CEO Craig Masback insisted all current
Olympians passed drug tests before the Games and said the current
U.S. team is drug-free. Jones is sure to face repeated questions
about drug topics as she tries to add to the gold medal in the 100
she won Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence Trammell and Mark Crear ran 2-3 in the men's 110-meter
hurdles, won by Cuba's Anier Garcia in 13.00 seconds. It was only
the sixth victory in the event by a non-American in 25 runnings.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. failed to medal in six of Monday's nine finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks were shut out in the men's discus, traditionally a
strong event for them. Virgilijus Alekna of Lithuania won with a
throw of 227-4. Adam Setliff was fifth in 216-7 and defending
gold-medalist Anthony Washington was 12th at 196-5.
</P>
<P>
   Haile Gabrselassie of Ethiopia won an extremely tight 10,000,
clocking 27:18.20, a mere .09 ahead of Kenya's Paul Tergat.
Americans Abdihakim Abdirahman and Meb Keflezighi were 10th and
12th, and ran personal-best times.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a superb race for me,'' said Keflezighi, an emigre
from Eritrea who attended UCLA. ``But it was a tough race; when
they surged with 10 laps to go, I was just not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's distance diva Gabriela Szabo of Romania won the women's
5,000 in an Olympic-record 14:40.79, beating Sonia O'Sullivan of
Ireland in a charge to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Mutola and Stephanie Graf ran 1-2 in the women's 800, and
Jonathan Edwards of Great Britain won the triple jump with a hop,
skip and jump of 58-1\. Robert Howard of the U.S. was seventh at
55-11\.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. sent Angelo Taylor and James Carter into the finals of
the men's 400 hurdles, and the trio of Gail Devers, Melissa
Morrison and Sharon Couch all reached the semifinals of the women's
100 hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Stember and Gabe Jennings advanced in 1,500 qualifying,
but Dwight Phillips was the only Yank to make the long jump final.
Seilala Sua was the lone American to gain the women's discus final.

   CLARKSDALE, Miss. _ In Eastern Kentucky, a 15-year-old boy
dreams of quitting school to make real money working at a pizza
parlor. Here in Clarksdale, a 68-year-old widow thanks God that she
can manage the $200-a-month rent on a house one good rain could
wash away. In East St. Louis, Ill., a 20-year-old mother of six
wishes she could find a public housing project where the broken
glass on the stoop is swept away.
</P>
<P>
   Poor people learn to keep hopes small. So when President Clinton
came calling on some of the poorest places in the country last year
with ideas to make things better, it was like rain in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   The president's six-state, four-day poverty tour, highlighting
for the first time in his term the places that remain untouched by
the longest economic boom in this nation's history, caused an
excitement that bordered on the spiritual.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the president's modest proposals for tax
incentives to bring businesses to impoverished communities are
still awaiting Senate approval. The idea that anything big might
happen to places that have been down longer than they were ever up
has long faded. And so is the notion that the federal government is
the answer to the empty downtowns, idle laborers and the
dilapidated buildings.
</P>
<P>
   In an election year, the people who might be buoyed by campaign
promises have little use for national politics. In dozens of
interviews in communities the president visited _ Clarksdale, East
St. Louis and in Eastern Kentucky _ what is clear is that people
are more concerned with how to fix their own communities than in
the state of the country.
</P>
<P>
   CLARKSDALE: FACING ADVERSITY, SEEING FEW CHANGES
</P>
<P>
   The morning of the day the president came to town, Sheila Fair
opened her flowers and gifts shop at 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Her store, on a nearly abandoned downtown strip, had been chosen
as the site of a meeting between Clinton and small-business owners.
</P>
<P>
   Fair, barely getting by after 21 years in business, would bet on
just two things that day. It would be hotter than heck, and
Clinton's visit would make great pictures.
</P>
<P>
   She was right. ``It was a great Kodak moment,'' Fair said.
</P>
<P>
   As she expected, nothing has really changed in the town of
22,000. The old movie house is still boarded. The Pac-Man lounge is
still closed. The falling down houses look ready to give up
completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's just like the president never came,'' said
Johnny Newson, still putting in the long hours at Newson's Auto
Parts to to compete with the Wal-Mart and Auto Zone.
</P>
<P>
   People here don't tend to blame the president, though.
</P>
<P>
   They blame Wal-Mart, for stealing business. Or Memphis, 75 miles
away, for stealing brain power. Or local politicians, for letting
downtown slip.
</P>
<P>
   They blame themselves, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``People got to want to improve,'' said Ethel Mae Clark, sitting
on the porch of her mother, Martha Riley, next door to a boarded
shack and across the street from a lot overrun with weeds.
</P>
<P>
   Riley's rent is $200 a month and she wishes she could afford
better. She blames not being able to read or write for her lot.
</P>
<P>
   But here, she added, ``Things just get worser.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, for some, Clarksdale is a proud place. Huge names in the
blues walked these streets: Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker grew
up here. Bessie Smith died here.
</P>
<P>
   The Delta Blues Museum attracts visitors from all over the
world. But after these visitors tour the museum, they have nowhere
else in Clarksdale to go.
</P>
<P>
   EAST ST. LOUIS: SELF-HELP IS SEEN AS THE SOLUTION
</P>
<P>
   It was Sunday, the sun shining like a halo, and the streets of
East St. Louis were virtually empty, as though the city had been
warned of an air raid.
</P>
<P>
   This made the abandoned buildings all over town stand out in
bold relief. From boarded churches to closed-down gas stations and
burned-out houses and storefronts, the rotting buildings, more than
1,500 in all, mocked the city's pride, marring every neighborhood.
So many businesses have left that when the president stopped by on
his poverty tour, the best example of a positive economic growth
that the city could come up with was a new Walgreen's.
</P>
<P>
   East St. Louis, with about 32,000 residents, 99 percent of them
African-American, is one very poor city. About 40 percent of the
residents live below the federal poverty line of $16,600 for a
family of four.
</P>
<P>
   The president's visit ``shed a lot of light on the things that
we have to offer,'' said Greg Lewis, one of a dozen members of the
local Democratic club who was spending his Sunday renovating a
building for its headquarters. ``A lot of it,'' Lewis added, to a
chorus of yeahs, ``depends on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other committee members, Lewis, 38, the father of two boys
and a relocation supervisor in St. Louis, could not say enough good
things about his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I have a six-figure income between us,'' he said.
``We live in this city because we believe in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and other residents talk about how much the city has
improved in 10 years. Then, the police cars did not have working
radios and the fire engines would not run. Trash piled high in the
streets. In 1990, a man who was physically abused in jail sued and
won, forcing the city to turn over the deed to City Hall. In 1991,
the city posted 68 homicides, a record.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with tax revenue from the Casino Queen riverboat, which
opened here in 1993, and the new $15 million hotel adjacent to it,
the city can afford at least basic services.
</P>
<P>
   But for the very poor, the city still looks very bleak. Andrea
Mitchell, at 20 the mother of six, moved here from Washington Park,
Ill., less than two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these empty lots and empty houses are terrible,'' said
Mitchell, who lives in a barrackslike public housing complex. ``The
streets need to be fixed. There really ain't no businesses here.
People should all pitch in and clean this place up.''
</P>
<P>
   APPALACHIA: ANGER AT BEING PART OF POVERTY TOUR
</P>
<P>
   Of all the jobs in Jackson County, Ky., those at Mid-South
Electronics Co. in Annville are among the most coveted.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-South, a manufacturer for several companies, has nearly 900
employees, and the nonunion shop keeps hiring more workers.
Employees say the pay, starting at $5.75 an hour, is pretty good,
especially considering medical benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stopped at Mid-South on his tour to prove that companies
can park themselves anywhere and do well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stopped in here because he cared about jobs, even if we
were doing fine already,'' said Della Dell, a supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of that kind of talk here. People are weary of
the image of Appalachian hillbillies. Some were insulted that the
president's visit was part of a ``poverty tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, 30 to 35 percent of the region lives below the poverty
line. For many, it didn't matter. People time and again said they
were blessed to live in a place as beautiful as Kentucky, where the
mountains are green and lush and the trees look as old as time.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact remains that very poor people still live along the
back roads of Appalachia, in houses that look like abandoned barns.
Some of them even live right on the roads for all the world to see.
</P>
<P>
   Take Jesse McWhorter, 15, and his family, who live off a county
road in Burning Springs, up the road from Annville (population
about 500).
</P>
<P>
   Jesse lives with his mother and two sisters, 11 and 8, in a
house with so many dogs and puppies and cats and kittens that no
one can say exactly how many they own.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse, chewing tobacco and spitting it, awkwardly, said he was
going to live a different life, looks forward to bright day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to start making some money,'' he said. ``I can
drive a truck. Or I can make pizzas.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ Celtics forward and guard Paul Pierce was stabbed
repeatedly early Monday morning while playing pool in a downtown
nightclub during a packed after-hours party.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapped in gauze and bleeding from at least seven stab wounds,
including one that pricked his lung, Pierce staggered into the
emergency room of nearby New England Medical Center, where friends
had driven him.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources close to Pierce, the leather jacket he wore
to the private party at the Buzz Club/Europa helped save his life,
protecting his vital organs when he was stabbed in the neck, back
and face, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   The sources also said Pierce, 22, was hit over the head with a
bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Battie, brother of Celtics player Tony Battie, and
Pierce's half-brother, Steve Hosey, were at the party with Pierce
and drove him to the hospital moments after the stabbing, according
to sources close to Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials said they expected Pierce _ the team's top
draft choice in 1998 who is regarded as a key player in rebuilding
of the Celtics _ to recover fully from his mostly superficial
wounds. He was in fair and stable condition after undergoing
surgery to repair his damaged lung.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Monday, relatives said, ``We would like to thank
everyone in Boston and the Celtics fans for their thoughts and
prayers. . . . Paul is in good spirits and is looking forward to
putting this ordeal behind him and returning to doing what he does
best, playing basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Early reports of the stabbing had Celtics fans fearing the
worst, calling to mind the untimely deaths of other young,
promising players such as Len Bias and Reggie Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   The stabbing marked the second time in less than three months
that a Celtics player has been the victim of a crime. In July,
Celtic Antoine Walker and Nazr Mohammed of the Philadephia 76ers
were robbed of cash and jewelry, including a $55,000 watch, while
sitting in a car with friends outside a Chicago restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   As Pierce recovered, police focused on two separate targets:
Associates of a rap group from the city's Roxbury section,
identified by witnesses as the alleged stabbers; and a nightclub
with a history of violence and code violations.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokeswoman Mariellen Burns said investigators had no
suspects or motive in the stabbing, which occurred at 1:10 a.m.
Monday, but were investigating associates of the group Made Men.
</P>
<P>
   But according to a police report, a witness who was working as a
security guard for the party said he recognized the suspects as
members of Made Men.
</P>
<P>
   In April, a member of the Made Men's trio, Marco Ennis, was
among several stabbing victims when a brawl broke out backstage at
the Fleet Center during a national tour of rap artists. The group
has been linked to several melees in the past, and one of its
former members was stabbed to death in a Roxbury nightclub in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But a lawyer representing Made Men said none of the rap group's
three members were involved in Pierce's stabbing and accused Boston
police of waging a vendetta against them after the group recorded a
controversial song criticized by police as an anti-cop rant.
</P>
<P>
   ``My clients had nothing to do with (Pierce's stabbing),'' said
John Swomley, who represents Ennis, Raymond ``Ray Dogg'' Scott and
Anthony Grant. ``Whether or not anyone who is wanna-be (Made Men)
did, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Swomley said he had contacted investigators in the stabbing and
asked if they wanted to speak to his clients, but the investigators
declined.
</P>
<P>
   Scott and Ennis, through Swomley, said they were at the party,
but had nothing to do with the brawl. Grant, they said, was
recording in New Jersey at the time. They said they didn't know
Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Ennis, who owns a clothing store, was at the party because he
outfitted models who had appeared in a hairdressers' show earlier
at Symphony Hall. The party at the club followed the show.
</P>
<P>
   As police searched for suspects and a motive, attention also
focused on the Buzz Club/Europa, whose liquor license has been
suspended five times in five years. The club is also the target of
a lawsuit by a former employee who was stabbed in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   According to a police source, a club manager who helped bandage
Pierce refused to call 911, and later denied having any knowledge
of the stabbings when police questioned him.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be the first time the club was accused of failing
to call an ambulance: In April, the club received a warning
stemming from a that fight broke out a few months earlier in which
club officials refused to call emergency medical crews, despite a
patron's request, according to the city's licensing board.
</P>
<P>
   According to state records, the club is owned by International
Europa Inc. The company is being sued by the guardian and family of
Torrey McCargo, the former employee who was stabbed in the heart
and lungs by a patron.
</P>
<P>
   McCargo, who reportedly stepped between fighting patrons, has
been in a vegetative state since his injury, said his attorney,
Clyde Bergstresser.
</P>
<P>
   Robert LaBerge, who said he is the club owner, said he is still
investigating the latest incident, which he termed rare. ``We hope
for a speedy recovery and our best wishes are with (Pierce) and his
family,'' said LaBerge.
</P>
<P>
   The building's owner, William M. Kaylor of Boston, could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to Pierce said the player, who is from Inglewood,
Calif., had resisted the pull of thug life at an early age and was
careful to avoid violent situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul is the type of individual who's very selective of who he
hangs around with and where he goes out,'' said Patrick Roy, his
coach from Inglewood High School. ``Inglewood was a tough area to
live in. If you can survive in Inglewood, you can survive anywhere.
If people or places present a remote change of something bad
happening, he wouldn't go.''

DEFENSE CHIEFS OF TWO KOREAS MEET ON REDUCING TENSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHEJU, South Korea _ In the most important meeting between North
and South Korea since their leaders met in June, the defense
ministers from both countries traveled here Monday to discuss
lowering tensions across their border, the most heavily armed in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was in what for the visiting 13-member North Korean
delegation must have been almost surreal opulence, a luxurious
seaside resort on the southernmost island of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps appropriately for countries that only recently began to
discuss political and military issues after more than a
half-century of animosity and threats, the lush meeting site, with
its beaches and volcanic peaks, is best known as a honeymooners'
destination.
</P>
<P>
   But just how difficult progress on the security issues that
separate the two sides will be was underscored even before the
talks began Monday morning by the lack of a working agenda for the
two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The sessions began with smiles after a lengthy handshake for the
cameras between the South Korean defense minister, Cho Seong-tae, a
retired general, and Kim Il Chol, minister of the People's Army of
North Korea, who was dressed in an olive-green uniform bedecked
with medals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see the morning papers?'' Cho asked his guest, to
which Kim replied, ``I feel a great sense of responsibility, given
all the expectations for these talks.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite a huge range of potential items for discussion, the
delegations remained behind closed doors for less than one and a
half hours before setting off on a sightseeing tour to view
mountain fortifications on Cheju built centuries ago against Mongol
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   An official of the South Korean Unification Ministry said the
first day's talks had been positive and relaxed. Although he
declined to elaborate, he said the discussions had allowed each
side to ``better understand the other side's position.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim and Cho were each in charge of their countries' military
forces the last time the countries exchanged fire, in June 1999, in
a naval skirmish in a disputed border area in seas west of the
Korean Peninsula. The fighting sank at least one North Korean
patrol vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Before the talks began, it was widely reported here that North
Korea had sought to keep the discussion between the two military
forces narrowly focused on demining and other security problems
related to reopening rail service between the countries, which the
heads of state agreed on in June. Train travel between the Koreas
ended just before the start of the Korean War in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea has reportedly been pushing for a much broader
discussion of security problems. Among the early
confidence-building measures that it seeks to propose for early
adoption are a hot line between the two armies, prior notification
of major troop movements and observation of military exercises by
each side.
</P>
<P>
   Seoul has also proposed a second round of talks by the defense
ministers, in the North in November, and seeks to make the meetings
a regular feature of the improving relations between the two
countries. After the talks tonight, the semiofficial Yonhap News
Agency agency reported that the two sides had agreed to hold the
second round in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, in November.
</P>
<P>
   In the background here, not on any public agenda but
unmistakably in the air, are increasingly bitter charges by the
South Korean opposition that the government is rushing through
financial assistance, food aid and diplomatic support for the
Communist North with little to show for the effort beyond the
symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   While the military delegations met Monday, two other delegations
met in Seoul to discuss investment in the North, whose economy has
been devastated by the disappearance of its former Soviet-bloc
allies and by a destructive cycle of drought and flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, North Korea said that it would require 1.4 million tons
of grain from international donors to feed its population of 22
million and to avoid a return of the famines that are believed to
have killed as many as two million people in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   On top of the pressure that the South Korean government has
begun to feel from its opposition, there have been related
expressions of concern from its main allies, the United States and
Japan, that have urged greater attention to security issues.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William S. Cohen visited South Korea and Japan
on an Asian tour last week. He emphasized at the stops that with
its suspected programs in nuclear, chemical and biological weapons
North Korea remained the major threat to peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's visit coincided with the release of a Defense Department
report that said North Korea's military preparedness had increased
substantially in the last year, despite the economic crisis and its
rapprochement with the South.
</P>
<P>
   In one example of combat readiness, according to recent
congressional testimony by Pentagon experts, North Korea fields an
artillery force of more than 12,000 self-propelled and towed weapon
systems. Without moving any artillery pieces, the North could
sustain up to 500,000 rounds an hour against the border defenses
for several hours.

   WORCESTER, Mass. _ The air is thick with sunlight and the smell of new paint
on walls and woodwork.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors, prospective owners and tenants, and older people who lived here
in less troubled times climb the stairs at an open house on a bright
September day and peek into the freshly renovated empty rooms of the
three-decker's ample apartments.
</P>
<P>
   The building will soon be sold _ the asking price is $149,900 _ to people of
modest means. The first-time home buyers' income may not exceed $43,500 for
a family of four; the buyer must live in one of the apartments and rent the
others to people with even less means.
</P>
<P>
   With the sale by now owner and developer Worcester Community Housing
Resources Inc., the green-and-cream three-decker at 8 Townsend St. becomes
another anchor in a fierce effort by a neighborhood group to reclaim
Worcester's Elm Park neighborhood from absentee landlords, gangs and drug
traffickers. Blighted property next door at 65 Russell St. was bought at the
same time and torn down for parking.
</P>
<P>
   Subsidies to fix up the Victorian-era three-decker came from the city and
state, and the acquisition and construction loans were given by WCHR's
largely church-backed Community Loan Fund and Flagship Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Key in an 11th-hour effort to wrest the property from a slumlord buyer's
hands was $35,000 in loans and grants raised by Evangelical Congregational
Church of Harvard and the Worcester Area Mission Society. The money helped
to shore up the overextended Community Loan Fund ""and avert disaster,''
said Peter S. Fellenz, executive director of WCHR.
</P>
<P>
   The role of U.S. churches in economic development reaches back 350 years.
But lately, faith-based initiatives such as the Community Loan Fund and the
Martin Luther King Jr. Business Empowerment Center that have built housing,
helped launch companies, prepare people for better-paying jobs and teach
financial literacy are receiving ringing endorsements from politicians and
the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston added its voice to the choir,
convening a three-day national conference on Faith-Based Community Economic
Development: Engaging the Black Church. The gathering drew more than 500
urban and rural participants from churches, government, businesses, schools,
foundations, nonprofits and other institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Fed President Cathy E. Minehan said the effort continued the bank's ongoing
work with diverse groups to collaborate and develop strategies that address
critical issues in community development. ""Now we embark on this very
exciting effort to engage faith-based organizations in developing wealth
creation strategies in the communities they serve,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The black church's special role as an agent of change in communities of
color was noted by conference co-chairs and Boston clergymen the Rev. Wesley
A. Roberts and the Rev. Ray Hammond. But the belief that faith-based
organizations should accept the challenge of leading their communities to
new levels of economic awareness and then act on that knowledge to
measurably improve the quality of life is a broad imperative with roots in
New England history.
</P>
<P>
   ""Three-hundred and fifty years ago, the Congregational ministers of
Massachusetts exhorted their congregations to invest in ironworks, sawmills,
gristmills and other elements to create a firm economic foundation for the
new Commonwealth,'' said the Rev. Robert S. Bachelder, minister for mission
and service of the Worcester Area Mission Society, United Church of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ""They were engaged in a radical experiment to test whether local churches
and communities could govern themselves without direction from kings and
bishops, and they realized the experiment could not succeed in the absence
of a solid physical and financial infrastructure,'' said Mr. Bachelder.
</P>
<P>
   The message from pulpits today about the responsible use of wealth is very
similar, he said. The challenge now ""is to reinvent America's historic
double commitment to economic opportunity and social equality in city
neighborhoods that have been disconnected from the wider structures of
opportunity by radical economic change.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Fed conference celebrated the success of faith-based economic
development initiatives across the nation and encouraged participants to
imagine what more could happen through partnerships, such efforts have been
quietly bearing fruit in Worcester for some time.
</P>
<P>
   In a former envelope factory at 237 Chandler St., for example, the MLK Jr.
Business Empowerment Center bustles with activity. The brick-and-mortar
result of a charge to Executive Director Robert L. Thomas from the Rev.
Richard Wright, pastor of Main South's Emmanuel Baptist Church, the center
houses a business incubator that is nurturing 10 small enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Tenants share office equipment, administrative support and technical
resources. Forums, workshops and seminars offer advice and guidance to
business owners and entrepreneurs in the broader community. The
42,000-square-foot building also provides space to a federal Business
Information Center, the Business Inclusion Council and University of
Massachusetts Extension Service.
</P>
<P>
   Revitalizing the inner city neighborhood doesn't just mean housing
development. The nearly $2 million Community Loan Fund _ half of its funds
come from churches, denominations, church members and people connected to
churches _ also supports business creation and expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Its funds are sometimes called ""tugboat'' money because they pull other,
bigger institutional participants into the mix. A $30,000 loan for
structural steel work on Santiago's Plaza, a minority-owned grocery store at
300 Pleasant St., leveraged a $200,000 loan from BankBoston, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Such efforts ""are a reflection of the religious community's enduring
commitment to use its resources to care for persons and communities in their
entirety,'' said Bachelder, a WCHR board member. ""A more humane society may
be built upon the foundation of a more prosperous society.''
</P>
<P>
   That people in churches far from Worcester's inner city are willing to
invest their money for a tiny 3 percent rate of return is perhaps difficult
to fathom in a day when stock market millions are made (and lost) overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ""These are people who believe they have been blessed in a lot of ways, they
have the money to invest and they want to do it in a socially responsible
way,'' said the Rev. Diana J. Augspurger, pastor of Evangelical
Congregational Church of Harvard. ""For these individuals and families, it
has to do with their understanding of putting their faith into practice and
saying let's do something with our money that makes a difference in the
world, not just in our bank accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   The exuberance on a fall day of a neighborhood celebrating the paint drying
on a renovated three-decker was palpable evidence of faith's good works.

<P>
   In 1983, the morning sickness drug Bendectin was removed from
the market amid a barrage of lawsuits claiming that it caused birth
defects. Now, in what medical and legal experts say is an
unprecedented reversal of fortune, it may well be brought back.
</P>
<P>
   A small, privately held Canadian company, Duchesnay Inc., is
working with the Food and Drug Administration to gain permission to
market a generic version of Bendectin, which it calls Diclectin.
Duchesnay is already selling the drug, its only product, in Canada,
labeling and marketing it specifically for pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   The company says _ and medical experts agree _ that dozens of
studies, many prompted by the litigation, have failed to find that
Bendectin poses any dangers to pregnant women or their fetuses. And
the drug agency said that since Bendectin was withdrawn by its
maker, independently of the agency, and was not withdrawn for
reasons of safety or efficacy, it might not be difficult to bring
it back.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea C. Masciale, a lawyer for the agency, explained that all
Duchesnay had to do was show the FDA that its generic Bendectin was
chemically the same as the original drug. No clinical studies or
research are required, which simplifies the process of its
reintroduction. ``We think they can achieve a product that is the
same as Bendectin and therefore come in with a generic version of
Bendectin,'' Masciale said.
</P>
<P>
   The development has stunned medical and legal experts, who say
that the possible re-emergence of Bendectin is so bold and
unprecedented that they are at a loss for comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   For many drug companies, birth defect experts, obstetricians and
law professors, the Bendectin story is unforgettable. Bendectin is
the only drug withdrawn from the market solely because of
litigation, said Jeffrey Trewhitt, a spokesman for the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bendectin was the archetypical case of junk science scuttling
a perfectly safe product,'' said Dr. Michael Greene, the director
of maternal-fetal medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital in
Boston. ``It was a sad episode in American jurisprudence.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Bernstein, a law professor at George Mason University
in Virginia, said it was only a twisted sort of poetic justice to
bring back Bendectin. ``There's no justice to the company who spent
over $100 million in litigation, not to mention having their chief
executives tied up in litigation for years and years,'' Bernstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   By 1980, 10 percent to 20 percent of pregnant women in the
United States were taking Bendectin. But soon afterward, when the
litigation was in full swing, Bendectin acquired a reputation
similar to that of thalidomide, the sedative that caused horrific
birth defects when women took it early in pregnancy. Women who took
Bendectin and also had babies with birth defects, especially limb
defects like missing fingers or missing bones from an arm or a leg,
found it hard to believe that the drug was not the cause. In fact,
one out of every 2,000 American babies born each year has a limb
defect and 2.5 percent of babies have serious birth defects. Yet
even if Bendectin was safe, as its defenders argued, few women or
their doctors wanted to use it.
</P>
<P>
   But now, doctors say, many of their pregnant patients have never
heard of the drug. That means that if Bendectin does return, it may
come in as a fresh product to a generation that has no prejudice
against it, medical experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Gervais, Duchesnay's executive vice president, is
optimistic that he will get the drug agency's approval to market
his generic version of Bendectin. In Canada, he said, the company
sells 70,000 bottles of Diclectin each year.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anthony Scialli, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at
Georgetown University School of Medicine, agreed. ``There's a huge
amount of safety data on Bendectin,'' Scialli said. ``It was the
best studied medication in pregnancy of all time _ not just for
nausea and vomiting, but the best studied, period.''
</P>
<P>
   Bendectin's maker, Merrell Dow, removed the drug from the market
not because of jury verdicts, but simply because of the expense of
dealing with thousands of lawsuits, said one of the company's
lawyers, Frank Woodside of Cincinnati. In fact, Woodside said, the
company never actually lost a case.
</P>
<P>
   The litigation eventually made legal history. Lawyers
representing women who said the drug had damaged their children
brought experts into court who were unqualified to comment and were
propounding junk science, critics said. In 1993, the Supreme Court
ruled on the matter, concluding that judges are to act as
gatekeepers and ensure that ``any and all scientific testimony or
evidence admitted is not only relevant, but reliable.'' Many judges
have made it clear that they will no longer allow Bendectin cases
in their courts.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Nace, a Washington lawyer who has represented close to 200
Bendectin families, said the lawsuits were pretty much hopeless.
``They make it so hard for plaintiffs to win these cases that it
almost doesn't matter what you say.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the drug's safety, Nace said, ``In my mind, there is no
question that Bendectin causes birth defects.''
</P>
<P>
   While Nace says he shudders to think that Bendectin might
return, obstetricians say they welcome it.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Lockwood, chairman of the department of obstetrics
and gynecology at New York University School of Medicine, said he
has seen large numbers of pregnant women whose lives were made
miserable by nausea and vomiting. ``We try all sorts of different
remedies,'' Lockwood said. In desperation, a few doctors say they
tell women essentially to make their own Bendectin. The
ingredients, an antihistamine and vitamin B6, are available over
the counter.
</P>
<P>
   Lockwood suggests that women make their own Bendectin. ``I tell
my patients, `I'm going to give you something that is the
equivalent of a drug called Bendectin, which is a great drug that
was forced off the market by litigation,''' he said. ``Our patients
will take anything because they are so miserable.''

WILLIAMS HAS ISSUES TO DIGEST AFTER LUNCH WITH BRASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Red Sox CEO John Harrington, no longer able to ignore
the rift between manager Jimy Williams and general manager Dan
Duquette that Duquette repeatedly had claimed did not exist, had
lunch with both men before the Sox headed to Chicago for their
final trip of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington was not available afterward for comment, according to
club spokesman Kevin Shea, but Duquette said that Williams was told
the Sox want him back to manage next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``John and I made it clear we'd like him to return as field
manager,'' Duquette told the Globe. ``We made it clear we expect
him to return.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, before boarding the team bus that took the team from
Fenway Park to Logan Airport, declined comment, according to Shea.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he'll see you tomorrow,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was given a one-year extension in the spring that
reportedly will pay him close to $1.1 million next season.
According to Duquette, who spoke with a Globe editorial writer
Monday, Williams did not disclose his intentions for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's reviewing the meeting and wants to digest it,'' Duquette
said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are credibility issues that Williams would be
wise to weigh before deciding whether he should return for his
fifth season, a term that would be longer than that of any Sox
manager since Mike Higgins (1955-59).
</P>
<P>
   Williams, after all, was here when Harrington and Duquette
claimed they wanted Mo Vaughn back after the 1998 season, an
exercise in duplicity that ended when the Sox allowed Vaughn to
become a free agent before making him an offer, one they knew would
fall far short of what Vaughn could command.
</P>
<P>
   And even before Williams finally felt compelled to call into
question management's loyalty to him after Duquette declined to
chastise All-Star center fielder Carl Everett for his behavior last
Thursday, when he showed up late, cursed his manager, and nearly
came to blows with teamDarren Lewis, there were indications that
the Sox were trying to submarine Williams over other issues. Those
included his refusal to play Izzy Alcantara and the release of
veteran Mike Stanley, which seemed to come as something of a
surprise to the manager.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, when it was suggested to Williams that he values
his self-respect and dignity more than money, he agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're right,'' he said. ``But I'm not leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   This much is certain. Williams will not quit before this season
ends in Florida against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. And the weight of
public opinion would make it highly inadvisable now for the Sox to
fire Williams, not when it would appear he was being sacrificed for
the sake of Everett, whom Duquette already has pledged will be back
next season, even if his own clubhouse has become sickened by
Everett's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said Monday that Williams was told the team would back
him if he chooses to take any disciplinary action against Everett,
who has been limited to pinch-hit duty since taking himself out of
the lineup last Thursday. That's a 180-degree flip from Duquette's
assertion last Thursday night that no disciplinary action against
Everett would be taken, a decision Duquette made even before
discussing the matter with Williams.
</P>
<P>
   And back in early August, when Everett engaged Williams in a
profane tirade on the day he returned from his 10-game suspension,
Duquette appeared to make light of the matter after Everett had a
big game that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   One of Williams's closest friends said Monday that he suspects
Williams does not know himself yet what he intends to do. This much
is known: If Williams leaves, he will have no trouble landing
another job. Lou Piniella almost certainly will leave Seattle after
this season, perhaps for the Tampa Bay job. Williams has a big fan
in Seattle GM Pat Gillick. And even if the right managerial job did
not surface for Williams, he would be perfectly content to return
to Atlanta and be a coach for Bobby Cox, his longtime friend.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, meanwhile, had one highly attractive potential
successor eliminated from the field Monday when the Montreal Expos
announced that Felipe Alou will be back next season.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Sommers played baseball with Williams at Fresno State.
Sommers played third base, Williams shortstop. Sommers was the farm
director for the Angels when he hired Williams for his first job as
a minor league manager, in 1974. Sommers is now in the insurance
business in Fresno but has remained close to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say he'll be back to manage next season,'' said
Sommers, who hasn't spoken with Williams during this latest crisis.
``He genuinely likes Boston, and genuinely loves his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, he needs to feel like the organization is
supporting him, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I have known him, he has never once, when we've spoken,
criticized Dan Duquette or the ownership. We had a long
conversation a couple of weeks ago when I heard some frustration in
him, the first time I'd ever heard that in him, but he said, `I'll
be all right.'
</P>
<P>
   ``In all my years in baseball, I've never known anyone who
worked harder, paid more dues, or had greater integrity than Jimy
Williams. He will not lie to anybody, hide anything, or do anything
fuzzy. He's a straight arrow, which is why I think so many players
and coaches like him, because they know they can trust him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not perfect by any means, but he really loves managing in
the big leagues. And he'll stand by his principles.''

OIL PRICES EBB AFTER RELEASE OF EMERGENCY CRUDE RESERVES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The prices of crude and home heating oil fell Monday in the wake
of the Clinton administration's decision last week to release 30
million barrels of oil from the nation's emergency reserve. But it
still appears that this will be a difficult winter for consumers,
as home heating oil and gasoline prices remain near 10-year highs.
</P>
<P>
   Even optimistic energy analysts do not think the added supply
will rescue home heating oil users from a bitter fall and winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be tight; prices will be high,'' said Charles T.
Maxwell, senior energy analyst at Weedon &AMP; Co. in Greenwich, Conn.
``But we will get through the winter without people freezing for a
lack of fuel.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, this means that people will be wearing sweaters
and may be paying close to $2 a gallon to fill their home heating
oil tanks. The East Coast retail price averaged $1.4635 a gallon
last winter, with a high of $1.9470 in the first week of February,
according to the Energy Information Administration. The price
reached $2.1230 in New York state that week.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the additional oil from the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
inventories of crude oil, which reached 24-year lows in August, are
still tight. Heating oil inventories nationally, according to the
energy agency, are at 48.1 billion barrels, down from 72.4 billion
a year ago. On just the East Coast, heating oil inventories are
24.4 billion barrels, down from 48.5 billion a year ago. The 3
million to 5 million barrels in additional home heating oil the
Clinton administration is promising would reduce that gap only
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   The 800,000 barrels a day in increased production that OPEC
promised earlier this month will not start flowing until Oct. 1,
and it takes about six weeks to arrive at refineries in the United
States. The crude oil from the reserve is not expected to show up
as home heating oil at the retail level until the end of November
or December. Bill Richardson, the energy secretary, said that the
extra barrels of home heating oil expected assumes that refineries
produce that fuel at a pace above their normal rate.
</P>
<P>
   And things can go wrong. First, there is the weather. Last
winter was unusually warm. So if this winter is just average, it
will be colder, increasing the demand for home heating oil. The
Energy Information Administration is projecting a 6 percent
increase in consumption this winter in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The other wild card is Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader. Iraq
produces 2.3 million barrels of crude oil a day, about 4 percent of
daily consumption. With the United Nations about to debate
reparations for Kuwait and the approach of the expiration in
December of the Iraq food-for-oil program, which allows it to sell
oil to meet its country's humanitarian needs, some analysts are
worried that the Iraqi leader might cut or halt production.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook, said Irene King, senior oil markets analyst at J.P.
Morgan &AMP; Co., ``depends on the weather now and Saddam.'' She said
that Iraq had temporarily halted production in the past when its
food-for-oil program came up for renewal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that the SPR sale does not change the
reality of a tight supply-demand balance, with capacity constraints
in both OPEC and non-OPEC nations,'' Merrill Lynch's energy team
said in a bulletin on the effect of the release of the 30 million
barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   But despite questions on the impact of the extra oil from the
reserve, the announcement on Friday did affect prices. On the New
York Mercantile Exchange, the price of crude oil for November
delivery dropped $1.11, or 3.4 percent, to $31.57. The price of
home heating oil for October delivery fell 1.41 cents, or 1.5
percent, to 94.07 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The price of unleaded gasoline for October delivery fell 1.26
cents, or 1.3 percent, to 92.70 cents a gallon. Much of the crude
oil from the petroleum reserve will go into the production of more
gasoline and diesel fuel. Richardson said on Friday that this
action ``will likely benefit everyone who drives a car.''
</P>
<P>
   The average price of retail regular unleaded gasoline nationally
hit a high of $1.681 a gallon in June. While it fell to $1.447 a
gallon in August, it is rising again as the strong economy and the
popularity of low-mileage vehicles like sport utility vehicles is
keeping demand strong. The price for the week ended Monday was
$1.548 a gallon, the Energy Information Administration said.
</P>
<P>
   Two parts of the crude oil release helped enhance its effect,
analysts said. One is that the administration released 30 million
barrels of crude oil, instead of the 5 million barrels that Vice
President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, had asked
for. In addition, the administration said it would review the need
for oil in 30 days, which could mean another release just before
Election Day on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has taken some of the risk premium and the
panic from the price,'' King said. She added that the larger amount
of oil released and the threat of more would make traders who had
been betting on further price increases more cautious.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell said that some of the recent surge in prices, which took
crude oil to $37.80 a barrel last week and home heating oil to
$1.0760 a gallon two weeks ago, may be, in part, a result of both
local home heating oil companies increasing their normal reserves
and homeowners filling up their tanks earlier than normal. If this
is the case, then some of the normal winter pressure on home
heating oil prices may have just come earlier in the season.
</P>
<P>
   But he is still worried about the outlook, especially because
this will be a fall and winter season when the inventories and
stocks of home heating oil and natural gas, the other winter fuel,
will be at much lower than normal levels, in large part because of
strong demand. ``It is a difficult problem when you have a lack of
oil,'' he said. ``It is a double whammy when you have a lack of oil
and natural gas.''
</P>
<P>
   The other reason that the announcement of the release of the 30
million barrels may mislead some is that very little of that crude
oil ends up as home heating oil. This is because oil refiners
cannot alter their production mix much and because there is still
demand for other oil products, including gasoline and diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Petroleum Institute, a refined barrel
of oil generally produces about 45 percent gasoline and 20 percent
to 25 percent depending on the season, of distillate. Home heating
oil and diesel fuel are made from distillate. The rest of the
barrel is jet fuel, petrochemical stocks and the residual fuel used
by utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Of the distillate, about one-third goes to home heating oil and
two-thirds to diesel fuel. Based on this formula, about 2.5 million
barrels of the 30 million would be home heating oil. The extra
production the administration is counting on would bring the number
into the 3 million to 5 million range. &QL;

   THE MEDIA'S SUBLIMINAL REACTION
</P>
<P>
   The cover of The New Republic, dated Oct. 2, looks a lot like
any other cover of the weekly political magazine. But careful
readers might notice something different. In the solid red bar that
appears on the cover of every issue are the barely visible words
``Don't Trust Arafat.''
</P>
<P>
   What gives with the subliminal sloganeering? Peter Beinart, the
editor, said he ran the hidden headline, which does not refer to an
article inside the magazine, as ``a response to the media obsession
with subliminal advertising'' _ a reference to the brouhaha that
erupted after the barely visible word ``rats'' flashed in an
advertisement for Gov. George W. Bush, intentionally or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everyone was suddenly venting their deepest darkest
obsession in subliminal ways,'' Beinart went on, ``why not us?
``It's a humorous caricature of our position,'' he said.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mayor Anthony A. Williams, backed by Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan and Eleanor Holmes Norton, this city's nonvoting
congressional delegate, on Monday urged the reopening of
Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House, calling it a
``visual blight'' to ``America's Main Street.'`
</P>
<P>
   The street was closed in the wake of the 1995 bombing of the
federal building in Oklahoma City, but Williams unveiled an
architectural plan by the firm of Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill and a
security study by the Rand Corp. that he contended showed a way to
safeguard the president and those working at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The key element would be solid pedestrian bridges that would
permit access by cars and even by sport utility vehicles less than
7 feet, 6 inches high _ but not trucks like the one used in the
Murrah Center bombing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also calls for narrowing the avenue, which once
held eight lanes of traffic, to four lanes and bowing it away from
the White House _ drawn from a design once suggested by Thomas
Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service was cool to the proposal. ``We are agreeable
to sit down with anybody on this issue to hear anyone's proposal
and concerns,'' said Jim Mackin, a Secret Service spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Mackin said the agency had received a summary of the proposal,
and added that from ``what we have seen so far, in our opinion, the
same vulnerabilities exist that led to the closing of Pennsylvania
Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   A meeting involving the proponents, the Secret Service and
Lawrence Summers, secretary of the Treasury, which oversees the
Secret Service, will be held later this week, government officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   But before that, Norton and Moynihan were each sharply critical
of the Secret Service Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Norton called it a ``secret police,'' and said said it
``operates with tunnel vision, considering security almost alone,
not other American values or the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan, the retiring senior senator from New York who has
worked to develop Pennsylvania Avenue for four decades, said the
service pursued the impossible goal of ``zero risk,'' and would
accept this plan ``if they have any reason left to them at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan was put together by the Federal City Council, a
private, nonprofit business-supported organization. Its president,
former Sen. Bob Dole, issued a statement saying, ``The closed
section of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House not only
symbolizes giving in to our fear of terrorism, but it has resulted
in literally cutting in half the downtown of the nation's
Capital.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that ``fundamental American values, such as openness and
accessibility, must not be sacrificed for the sake of security.''
</P>
<P>
   The official White House response to the proposal, first
reported on Monday by The Washington Post, did not deal with any
concerns other than security. The Rand study said the Secret
Service and the Treasury Department had been unwilling to meet with
the study's authors, who got their security information from the
FBI instead.
</P>
<P>
   Security and the principle of openness are not the only issues.
Terence Golden, chairman of the Federal City Council, said the
closing of the main east-west thoroughfare in the city ``is
strangling our transportation and our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Joyner of the Parsons Transportation Group said the
avenue used to carry 29,000 vehicles a day, which have been
diverted to other streets.
</P>
<P>
   The traffic-free area in front of the White House is now used by
pedestrians, skateboarders and roller-hockey players. The tour
buses that once idled there now park on the other side of Lafayette
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Another change made in 1995, blocking 13,000 vehicles a day from
westbound lanes on E Street south of the White House, will end this
fall when reconstruction of the street further from the White House
is completed.

Predictive, based in New York, will pay $9 million in cash and 2.2
million of its own shares for Synet. Predictive's shares closed
Monday at $15.12, down $1.88, giving the deal a value of about $42
million. ``What was attractive about Synet was that in addition to
having very strong technical people who are up on the latest

   SYDNEY, Australia -- Everybody who witnessed Cathy Freeman's
gold-medal run in the 400 meters on Monday - there were 110,000 at
Olympic Stadium, but many of them undoubtedly had their eyes
covered or closed during the race - will tell you the same thing:
</P>
<P>
   It was an easy win.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe them.
</P>
<P>
   It's true Freeman thundered out of the third turn and put a
comfortable distance between herself and silver medalist Lorraine
Graham of Jamaica. The win was a gift to the indigenous people of
this country from one of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sister Girl,'' as Freeman is fondly known to a small but
increasingly vocal Aboriginal population, was timed in 49.11 to
Graham's 49.58.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after arriving on the international scene as a 1600
relay runner at the Commonwealth Games, Freeman, 27, had fulfilled
her destiny. She had become the first Aborigine to win an Olympic
gold medal in an individual sport.
</P>
<P>
   But at what cost?
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour before the race, Tony Ryan was sitting on a
felled tree limb in Victoria Park, blowing on an Aboriginal wind
instrument called a didgeridoo. This city's illuminated downtown
skyline provided a breathtaking backdrop to the soulful scene
playing itself out in the tent city some Aborigines are calling
home for the duration of the 27th Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   A bonfire was burning nearby and a few women were dancing with
the flames. Everyone else was gathered around a television that was
tuned to live Olympic coverage.
</P>
<P>
   A man fiddled with the antenna atop the set until the 21-inch
picture was as sharp as the contrast between an Aborigine's life in
Australia and the average white person's. The night air was brisk
and billowing with anticipation. The mood was more somber than
celebratory.
</P>
<P>
   White Australia loves Freeman because she has breathed life into
its moribund track program (her gold medal was the first won by the
Australia in track since 1988).
</P>
<P>
   Aboriginal Australia worships Freeman because she has breathed
life into their moribund dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the 386,000 Aborigines in this country of 19
million live in poverty. To be an indigenous person in Australia is
to feel largely invisible in myriad ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only place where we are the majority,'' said Ryan
ruefully, ``is in the prisons.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the marginalization of the Aborigines' lives more
manifest than in the Stolen Generation, a systematic government
policy adopted in 1918 and carried out for nearly 60 years whereby
Aboriginal children were removed from their homes and placed with
white families.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman cannot forget that the same government that regards her
as a national treasure once spirited two of her grandparents away
from their homes as children and placed them with other families.
In July, she lashed out at a government official who downplayed the
damage done by the policy.
</P>
<P>
   As the start of the 400-meters final drew near, Ryan's thoughts
turned to the two different worlds Freeman is constantly having to
straddle and the toll it must take on the self-described ``shy
little thing'' to satisfy everybody, never mind herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``She starts out as a little girl who likes to run.'' Ryan said.
``Now she has become a symbol for the Aboriginal people, our great
hope. Great pressure has been put on her. Why does one person have
to strive so much for the rest of us? Why does it take somebody to
run so fast to gain the respect of people?''
</P>
<P>
   In his job counseling teens who abuse alcohol and drugs, Ryan
sees the flip side of Freeman: Aboriginal kids who find excellence
elusive and feel worthless in the eyes of the larger culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not excellent, you're nothing,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman is nothing more than a runner; nothing less than a
symbol of a country's reconciliation with its past. So much had
been placed on her slight shoulders, it was a small wonder to Ryan
that defending Olympic 400 champion Marie-Jose Perec was the one
who fled the country last week and not Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how Cathy does it,'' Ryan said. ``It's a lot of
pressure to handle. I believe when Cathy's sitting down at the end
of the day, she's saying, `What gets me through this, man?'
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is it's taking a power greater than her to see her
through. No single person could do it herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan started to say more, but his words were drowned out by a
cheer that reverberated like a thunderclap. It came from the crowd,
now numbering nearly 100, that was gathered around the television.
</P>
<P>
   He hurried over to join the semi-circle just in time to see
Freeman in a network promo, saying, as if she herself couldn't
quite believe it, ``I am an Olympian. I actually am the best in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ahh, Sister Girl,'' someone hollered.
</P>
<P>
   A few members of the German women's volleyball team joined the
crowd, conspicuous in their black sweats with the ``Deutschland''
written on their backs, just as a studio television announcer was
setting up the race.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Freeman didn't win, the talking head said, ``We love her
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We love her more,'' a man shouted back.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the minute in which this oversized island stood still.
As Freeman ran free down the stretch, politics and posturing gave
way to genuine pride and pleasure. An unadulterated cheer went up
when Freeman crossed the finish line. There were smiles all around
at Victoria Park.
</P>
<P>
   On the television screen, Freeman wore no smile, just a look of
tortured relief.

yesterday in my mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   My college transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   The horrible part about all this is: I actually wrote to the
nice people who report for duty every day at the Official
Transcript Office at THE Ohio State University, a busy, busy place,
I'm sure, and I asked for this. I even paid money. But that's
another story for another day. Literally.
</P>
<P>
   So, the transcripts arrived and I pulled them out and looked at
them and I had a warm feeling, a feeling of nostalgia, an odd
feeling of been-there, done-that, a feeling that I was young with
clear skin and it was fall and the air was crisp and I was skipping
and looking vainly and insanely for love. A feeling that I was
young again, cute and pudgy, not old and fat.
</P>
<P>
   And then I looked at my grades. The world started spinning and
the voices inside my head started going backward, like on the
Beatles' ``White'' album, and I fell into my salmon-colored,
ergonomically correct home office chair with the permanently
greased ball-bearing wheels and I cried:
</P>
<P>
   Bless me, father, for I have sinned.
</P>
<P>
   No. Wait.
</P>
<P>
   That's the nightmare I had night-before-last about condoms and
the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   I cried:
</P>
<P>
   Bless me, father, for I am stupid!
</P>
<P>
   See. All these years I've been sailing through life resting on
my laurels from my tearful induction into the Columbiana High
School National Honor Society (I've never washed where the sword
tapped my shoulder). I mean, come on. How many times in a woman's
life does she have to prove she's smart?
</P>
<P>
   Isn't once in 1973 enough?
</P>
<P>
   Well, apparently there are certain individuals in our society
who want us to keep proving ourselves and keep proving ourselves
and keep proving ourselves, a little goal I forgot to make note of
from 1974 to 1979 in my college-ruled spiral notebook. Apparently,
I just wrote down: Drink beer. Go to Big Ten football game. Drink
more beer.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I got some A's. My first quarter at that zany Ivy League
college of OSU, I sailed through Freshman Composition, Elementary
French, Education Survey 101 (?????). But after that, my dear
friends, it was all downhill, and as time went on, I even went
below the Earth's surface. I got D's! I got F's! Some quarters I
signed up for five classes and withdrew from four. Yet this is what
I've told ``people'' for the past 21 years of my life:
</P>
<P>
   ``I did OK in college. I never went to class. I never studied.
But I got decent grades.''
</P>
<P>
   Repression is a marvelous thing.
</P>
<P>
   Please understand: I don't shy from challenge. I got married
once. I gave birth once. Once I even made pie crust FROM SCRATCH!
But I do not recommend pulling out your economics and linguistic
grades from 22 years ago, not even once. What's the point? A lot of
us parents know that if we went to college now, we'd do it all
differently. We'd go to class. We'd sip red wine, not chug cheap
beer. We'd take business courses, not Introduction to Logic 150,
because, what is the logic in studying logic? Like that's really
going to help when the obnoxious 2-year-old won't put on his shoes.
</P>
<P>
   So, there you have it. My sordid past. I must call my parents
ASAP and anoint them with sainthood. I must call my parents ASAP
and repent.
</P>
<P>
   I must call my parents and poke around a bit to see if I even
went to college. Maybe they had me locked in my old room or
something? One can hope.
</P>
<P>
   Because, see, the most troubling thing about my past is not the
grades _ which, OK, weren't quite up to my CHS NHS standards. (And
I'd like to apologize right now for letting the old group down.)
The most troubling thing is the gap in time, huge gaps in time,
gaps that are more mysterious than the silence on the Watergate
tapes.
</P>
<P>
   According to my Official College Transcript _ and why would a
piece of paper lie? _ I had a six-month period in 1978 when I did
not attend college. No F's. No D's. No withdrawals. Nothing. And to
the best of my recollection _ which I realize now might be a little
suspect _ I wasn't off doing anything interesting. I wasn't off
doing anything important. I wasn't backpacking around Europe. I
wasn't learning yoga. I wasn't even doing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, I just wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope I recycled the beer cans.

IN THIS GLADIATOR ARENA, EVEN NERO IS BLOODLESS
</HEADLINE>
  By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The first lesson at the gladiator school of the Roman
Historical Society stressed discipline. ``You are slaves, and that
is how I will treat you,'' Giuseppe Coluzzi, 32, barked at eight
adults fidgeting in short white togas.
</P>
<P>
   Coluzzi, who uses the name ``Korakos'' in the arena, glared at
them icily. Using the Latin phrase for ``Hail, teacher,'' he said,
``You will address me by saying `Ave, magister,' and you will never
use your swords outside the arena or without a magister present.''
</P>
<P>
   There were a few snickers, but mostly, the five men and three
women who signed up last week to learn how to fight to the death
listened raptly through two hours of gladiator history and combat
theory (two points for a blow to the thorax).
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always been a Roman history buff, but I want to relive
it more intensely,'' Giuseppe Pecorelli, 51, an employee of a
German multinational corporation, explained as he yearningly flexed
his wooden practice sword. ``It is one thing to read histories or
Roman poetry. I want to get in touch with my warrior side.''
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Historical Society, which has about 100 members, was
founded in 1994, and is fittingly situated on the Via Appia Antica,
the ancient Appian Way, the road where legend has it that St. Peter
saw an apparition of Christ, and asked, ``Quo vadis, Domine?''
(``Whither goest thou, Lord?'')
</P>
<P>
   The society has a Web site (digilander.iol.it/sergioiac/), a
clubhouse and a yard littered with helmets, shields, pikes, nets,
catapults and other martial accessories. The members devote most of
their time to staging Roman scenes and battles for pageants and
town fairs. But the society, which had long hoped to open a
gladiator school, seized the coattails of the summer Hollywood hit
``Gladiator,'' starring Russell Crowe, to begin offering classes
this month.
</P>
<P>
   And these Roman history buffs, unlike many classicists in Italy
and the United States, do not quibble with the liberties
``Gladiator'' screenwriters took in rewriting ancient Roman
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie was excellent,'' Korakos stated defiantly. The
trainer, whose day job has him printing Euro currency bills for the
Bank of Italy, said he had seen ``Gladiator'' four times.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the new students, who paid $100 for a two-month
course, said they were drawn to gladiator school by the movie.
Training for the female ``Amazon'' division, Patricia Mincone, 29,
a hospital worker, said she would never be influenced by Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for a workout that wasn't the typical routine _
tennis, aerobics, the things everybody does,'' she said. A tall
woman with muscular arms and legs, Mincone looked as though she
could easily stab, bludgeon or harpoon any of her fellow rookies.
</P>
<P>
   But gladiator school does not sanction real bloodletting.
Mostly, students are taught how to choreograph combat (four
sequences, six blows per sequence), both to savor simulated
savagery and, eventually, to perform gladiator combat the way it
was done in the Colosseum more than 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike American Civil War buffs who rigorously re-enact the
Battle of Gettysburg or Manassas, Italians are not known for an
obsession with dressing up and reliving past wars. Italy's somewhat
concise history of modern battlefield victories could be one
reason.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that Italians already have a centuries-old tradition
of religious re-enactments _ pageants and processions in which
whole towns turn out to recreate favorite passages of the Bible or
a saint's life. Every Easter since the 17th century, the city of
Sezze, in central Italy, performs its Passion Play, a re-enactment
of agonized journey to the cross on Good Friday. As many as 700
locals take part, playing roles as diverse as Mary, Pontius Pilate
and vicious bare-chested Roman guards who whip chained Hebrew
slaves as the procession moves through the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, even religious pageants bring out the ancient
brutality of some players, however. Several years ago, a few young
amateur actors in Sezze got carried away and inadvertently flogged
members of the audience. They were banished from future parades
until last Easter, when Sezze brought its Good Friday procession to
St. Peter's in Rome for the Holy Year.
</P>
<P>
   Gladiator school seems to appeal to Italians eager to rediscover
their pagan roots. ``We are the descendants of the early Romans, so
we of all people should explore our past,'' said Lia Cinque, 44, a
homemaker who is married to Pecorelli. Sighing, she said their
24-year-old son was also a history buff, but in a spurt of filial
rebellion, had joined a group whose members dress up as Scottish
clan warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Cinque explained that she herself was not interested in
gladiator training, and spent much of the lesson with her head
buried in a historical novel set in antiquity, ``Neropolis'' by
Hubert Monteilhet.
</P>
<P>
   A little like English history buffs who blame Shakespeare for
blackening the reputation of Richard III, longtime members of the
Roman Historical Society feel that Tacitus and others grossly
misjudged Nero.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Iacomoni, 47, who took the name Nero when he was elected
president of the society, held court over the class in a
full-length tunic embroidered with gold. Regally affable with the
new recruits, he nevertheless took umbrage at the suggestion that
his imperial role model was a bloodthirsty madman. ``Nero was
nowhere near Rome when the fires started,'' he said sternly,
referring to the legend that Nero fiddled as Rome burned.
</P>
<P>
   Iacomoni noted that many historians took a more revisionist view
of Nero, but perhaps in a re-enactment of his predecessor's
megalomania, he quickly added, ``Of course, I was the first, but
now there are others who also defend Nero.''

PROGRAMMER SPOTS E-TRADE COOKIE FLAW 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM ZUCKERMAN  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A freelance Internet security expert said he
found a potential cybernightmare in online broker E-Trade Group's
Internet operations _ a programming flaw that could have given
hackers easy access to customer accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Baker, a San Francisco computer programmer who hunts for
Internet security problems in his spare time, claimed malicious
computer jockeys could get a customer's user name and password
simply by stealing a ``cookie.'' Those are hidden files that Web
sites place on visitors' computers that are used to track return
visits.
</P>
<P>
   In what Baker described as an elementary security mistake,
customer data, including ultrasensitive passwords, were included in
E-Trade cookies and protected only with the most-easily broken type
of code.
</P>
<P>
   Unauthorized people could get their hands on the cookies using
basic hacking techniques and gain full access to customers'
accounts. That could have let hackers trade in customers' names and
remove money.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was incredibly boneheaded,'' Baker said. ``It was by far
the worst security breach I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet industry has experienced several cases of sensitive
customer information leaking out because of poor security, most
notably earlier this year when CDUniverse, a popular online music
store, was penetrated by a hacker who seized 300,000 credit card
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade has been the victim of attacks by hackers intent on
disrupting its operations.
</P>
<P>
   But stealing account information from a major Web brokerage
would be unprecedented and would raise fundamental questions about
the safety of managing finances online. Baker said he informed
E-Trade security personnel of the problem more than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company didn't remove the account information from cookies
until after Baker publicized his findings Friday and reports of the
problem surfaced on several Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   After E-Trade's repairs yesterday, hackers can still get some
account information, but can't steal passwords or carry out
brokerage operations, Baker said. ``It's been reduced from a
security problem to a privacy problem,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade, the No.3 online broker, confirmed it removed sensitive
account information from its cookies during the weekend. ``No
customer information has been compromised,'' said spokeswoman
Heather Fondo.
</P>
<P>
   Fondo said she had no information about other security issues
raised by Baker.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet site  &LR; securityfocus.com &LR;  said it received an e-mail
from E-Trade security director Clifford Reeser Friday describing
the cookie vulnerability as ``minor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We always maintain several checks and balances in our systems
and procedures to ensure that new vulnerabilities ... do not pose a
significant risk,'' Reeser wrote, according to SecurityFocus.com.
</P>
<P>
   At least one security buff who read Baker's notice posted a
message on the SecurityFocus site saying it took him 30 minutes to
figure out out how to obtain and read E-Trade cookies, which he
wrote were ``trivially encoded.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can easily steal that cookie,'' the security buff
wrote.

FOR ASIAN SATELLITE NETWORK, SIMPLICITY IS SIMPLY BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After months of gloomy news in the satellite communications
sector, analysts are looking forward to the commercial debut on
Wednesday of an Indonesian satellite phone venture focused strictly
on Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Iridium, the $5 billion global satellite system that went
bankrupt last year, and Globalstar, a $3 billion system struggling
with patchy service and too few customers, the Asia Cellular
Satellite System, known in the industry as ACeS, is based on a
single satellite in a fixed location more than 22 miles above earth
instead of an expensive constellation buzzing around in lower
orbits.
</P>
<P>
   That simplicity will result in slightly poorer voice quality,
but with base prices ranging from 35 cents to 75 cents a minute,
calls could be as much as 50 percent cheaper in some cases,
analysts say. The satellite has a unique antenna design capable of
directing traffic to the ground stations that can handle traffic
most efficiently. And ACeS will be the first venture to offer
satellite service on cell phones small enough to fit in a pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything from one end to the other has been done right,''
said Roger Rusch, president of Telastra, a satellite consulting
company based in Palos Verdes Estates, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   However, in what might serve as a timely reminder for investors
of how tough the satellite telecommunications business is,
Globalstar, a former high-flyer on Wall Street that now is
struggling financially, provided scant comfort to investors when it
announced on Monday that it had rounded up $68 million in new money
from its major backers. Globalstar shares, which have fallen 77
percent this year, edged up just 28 cents, to $9.97.
</P>
<P>
   Globalstar's new funds will push the projected date when it will
run out of money back about three months, or into next summer.
Analysts said the new funds represented something less than a
ringing endorsement from Loral Space and Communications Ltd., which
controls the venture, Qualcomm Inc., the Vodafone Group and the
other major investors.
</P>
<P>
   Globalstar's new funding came on the heels of a deal last week
in which Bear, Stearns agreed to buy $105 million in new Globalstar
stock. But Merrill Lynch analysts, in a note to investors, warned
them not to interpret it as a vote of confidence from Bear,
Stearns. Instead, they said, Bear, Stearns is getting the shares at
prices that should allow it to make a quick profit selling them.
</P>
<P>
   Another satellite venture, Orbcomm Global, filed a bankruptcy
petition last Friday so that it could continue to negotiate a plan
to convert some of its debt to equity to reduce its interest
expenses. Teleglobe Inc., a Montreal-based telecommunications
company, owns 68 percent of Orbcomm. The remaining 32 percent is
owned by the Orbital Sciences Corp. of Dulles, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Orbcomm's low-earth satellites do not carry voice communications
but instead are used to track rail cars, trucks and other vehicles
and to monitor the status of pipelines. The company ran into
trouble, analysts said, because each user needs what amounts to a
customized system. New customers are not being brought on line fast
enough to provide the cash needed to service the debt.
</P>
<P>
   ACeS seems more straightforward, but it will not be generating
profits anytime soon, said Adi R. Adiwoso, chief executive and
president of P.T. Pasifik Satelit Nusantara, the Indonesia company
that heads the ACeS partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Service will be expanded to the Philippines next month and
Taiwan by January, Adiwoso said. The satellite is capable of
reaching from Korea to India, covering 3 billion people, but ACeS
has yet to reach an agreement for operations in China, the single
biggest potential customer. Still, analysts like the venture's
focus and the fact that Adiwoso's partners include companies like
Lockheed Martin Global Telecommunications, the Philippine Long
Distance Telephone Co. and Jasmine International of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any mobile satellite phone system is going to survive, it
will be a regional player like ACeS,'' said William Pitkin, who has
been following Pasifik Satelit's stock for Merrill Lynch. A similar
system called Thuraya that has been developed by the Hughes Space
and Communications Co., a unit of General Motors, is scheduled for
deployment in the Mideast next month.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest hurdle for ACeS, said Michael French, an analyst at
ING Barings, is the cost of the GSM-format phones, which are made
by Sweden's L.M. Ericsson. The list price of about $1,000 is
cheaper than the Globalstar phones, which are listed at $1,500, but
still a hefty investment for many potential users.

LITTLE TO GAIN IN SWITCH TO DECIMAL STOCK TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
   By ARTHUR M. LOUIS  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The recent launch of decimal trading _ the
buying and selling of stocks priced in dollars and cents, rather
than fractions _ has been hailed as a great benefit for individual
investors.
</P>
<P>
   A benefit it may be _ but great?
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on it.
</P>
<P>
   Decimal trading was imposed on the nation's stock markets by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, acting in turn under pressure
from Congress. A pilot program began on Aug. 28 on the New York and
American stock exchanges, and Nasdaq will begin decimal trading in
March.
</P>
<P>
   All stocks on all markets must be decimalized no later than
April 9.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of decimal trading say it has three things going for
it:
</P>
<P>
   It will make it easier for the average investor to comprehend
stock prices. (Quick, what is the decimal equivalent of 13/16?)
</P>
<P>
   It will bring the U.S. markets in line with those of virtually
every other country.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing stock prices in decimals will narrow the spreads
between bid and asked prices, saving money for investors. (An
academic study suggests that this already is happening.)
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Michael G. Oxley, R-Ohio, a senior Commerce Committee
member and the person most responsible for jawboning the markets
into adopting decimal trading, has estimated that it will save
American investors as much as $3 million per trading day.
</P>
<P>
   Oxley's staff didn't respond to a request for information about
how the figure was calculated. But one can safely assume that Oxley
would not understate the value of decimal trading.
</P>
<P>
   While $3 million a day may seem impressive at first blush, in
fact it amounts to a measly $3 per year for every man, woman and
child in the United States. That will buy you somewhat more than a
gallon of gas _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, not every man, woman and child trades stocks
regularly _ or at all. Only about 30 million Americans own stock
directly, and only about 3 million trade as often as once a month.
</P>
<P>
   The people who stand to benefit most from decimal pricing are
professionals _ brokers, exchange specialists and other active
traders. The more they trade, the more they will save.
</P>
<P>
   The ordinary investor won't save much.
</P>
<P>
   The spread is the difference between a stock's bid price _ the
highest price offered by buyers at any given moment _ and its ask
price _ the lowest price offered by sellers.
</P>
<P>
   On Nasdaq, the spread is established by brokerage firms that
make a market in a stock. On the Big Board and Amex, the spread
generally reflects the limit orders (buy orders with a maximum
price, sell orders with a minimum price) submitted by investors.
</P>
<P>
   With fractional pricing, the minimum difference between the bid
and ask prices is commonly 1/16th of a dollar, or 6.25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, for example, that the Nasdaq marketmaker's bid on
Microsoft stock is $62 and the ask is $62-1/16. A buyer can come
into the market, supersede the existing high bid price by offering
$62-1/16 _ the minimum increase _ and buy the stock. On a
1,000-share transaction, the buyer will pay a total of $62.50 more
than the stock would have cost at the superseded bid price.
</P>
<P>
   With decimal pricing, by contrast, the spread between the bid
and ask prices could be as small as 1 cent per share _ the standard
decimal increase.
</P>
<P>
   So, on a 1,000-share trade, you might be able to beat the
existing bid and do the deal for a total extra payment of $10 _
$52.50 better than you could have done with fractional pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the situation is a bit more complicated than that.
</P>
<P>
   If you raise the bid price by only 1 cent _ to $62.01 in our
hypothetical Microsoft example _ you may not find a marketmaker
willing to sell you the full 1,000 shares at that price.
</P>
<P>
   You might, for example, get only 100 shares, forcing you to
scale up your bid prices on the remaining 900 shares. So, in our
example, you may wind up saving considerably less than $52.50.
</P>
<P>
   Decimal trading also will make it safer for market professionals
_ brokers, marketmakers, stock-exchange specialists _ to pull off a
controversial trading maneuver known as front-running.
</P>
<P>
   With front-running, professionals who have access to a list of
outstanding limit orders on a given stock will scrutinize it,
looking for signs of strong buying demand that could push the stock
up.
</P>
<P>
   If a stock looks like a buy, the front-runner places a buy order
higher than the highest bid then waits for a seller to place a
market order _ an order not specifying any price limit. The
professional will then buy the stock from that seller.
</P>
<P>
   With stocks traded strictly in fractions, the front-running
trader typically had to offer at least 6.25 cents more than the
highest bid. With stocks traded in decimals, a bid 1 cent higher
can do the job, reducing the amount the trader risks in case the
stock declines.
</P>
<P>
   Len Mayer, executive vice president of Schwab Capital Markets, a
market-making subsidiary of Charles Schwab Corp., says decimal
pricing will result in more trades, fewer shares per trade, and
more price movement, or volatility.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Spellman, a spokesman for the Securities Industry
Association, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   He cautions that the increase in the number of trades will have
a big impact on the industry's computer systems, perhaps causing
jams as more trade-confirmation notices and other messages flow
between customers and brokers.
</P>
<P>
   For marketmakers like Schwab Capital Markets, the average profit
per trade will decrease as spreads decrease.
</P>
<P>
   But Mayer figures that at least some of that slippage will be
offset by increasing volume. That's because traders, finding it
less costly to trade, might be motivated to trade more.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq hasn't begun decimal trading yet because of delays in
adapting its computer systems, says spokesman Scott Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   On the Big Board and Amex, decimal trading began Aug. 28 with
seven and six stocks, respectively. Yesterday, those exchanges
added 103 more securities.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of diligent finance professors already have published a
study _ and even added an update _ on the market effects of decimal
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Market spreads have indeed shrunk, according to the study by
Sugato Chakravarty of Purdue University and Robert A. Wood of the
University of Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   In their updated study, they compared the spread sizes for the
13 original stocks during the 15 days before decimal pricing began
on the Big Board and Amex and the 10 days after it began.
</P>
<P>
   On the Big Board, the spreads were down an average of 38
percent, while on the Amex, they were down 47 percent.

 &HT;    EPA tightens arsenic standard for drinking water
 &HT;    By Kristin McAllister
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUTLER COUNTY, Ohio _ If approved, a new rule proposed by the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
</P>
<P>
   will begin enforcing in January a new standard for the maximum
contamination limit of arsenic in drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Application of the new standard will affect Butler County, said
John Thomas of Environmental Science &AMP; Engineering Inc., because
southwest Ohio has hot spots of the element.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 amendment to the Safe Drinking Water Act requires the EPA
to revise
</P>
<P>
   the existing drinking water standard for arsenic. The current
arsenic limit is 50 parts per billion, though the international
arsenic standard is set at 10 ppb _ a discrepancy that prompted EPA
officials to examine varying opinions concerning long-term health
effects related to low-level exposure.
</P>
<P>
   The new standard calls for the current standard to be changed to
5 ppb. Because arsenic is an element, contamination to a
drinking-water source can result from both natural or human
activities, the EPA reports, indicating that about 90 percent of
industrial use falls into wood preservative
</P>
<P>
   purposes. A ban now restricts the use of arsenic in the making
of pesticides, weed killers and embalming fluids, although these
substances have contributed to drinking-water contamination, the
EPA reports.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA reported that Southwest Ohio purveyors have detected
levels between 5 to 10 ppb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some well field areas have 7 ppb levels,'' Thomas said. The
EPA estimates that the new standard will protect about 22.5 million
people from cancer and other health problems, including diabetes
and
</P>
<P>
   cardiovascular disease, as well as developmental and
neurological effects.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a reduction per year of about 20 cases of bladder
cancer and about five bladder cancer deaths, the agency estimates.
At the same time, the EPA proposed that non-transient,
non-community water systems, serving at least 25 of the same people
for more than six months per
</P>
<P>
   year _ including schools and nursing homes _ be required to
notify people served by those systems when arsenic exceeds the
standard.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA reports that more than 98 percent of the new rule
compliance costs will come from adding treatment equipment,
chemicals, and the overseeing of the new treatment. The EPA
estimates that the new 5 ppb standard will cost per year and per
household about $28 for homes served by large water systems, and
about $85 for those served by small water systems.
</P>
<P>
   Compliance of the new rule is required by 2004 to 2006, with
varying dates, depending on the size of the water system.

endangering children and
</P>
<P>
   illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material.
</P>
<P>

RULE CHANGE WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR INSIDERS TO MAKE LEGAL TRADES 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHLEEN PENDER  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Starting next month, it should get easier for
the Securities and Exchange Commission to prosecute illegal
insider-trading charges and for employees to avoid them.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for this apparent contradiction is SEC rule 10b5-1,
which was adopted with little fanfare last month but could have
profound implications for employees, directors and shareholders of
public companies.
</P>
<P>
   The rule, which takes effect Oct. 23, says insiders can legally
buy or sell their company's shares while they are aware of material
nonpublic information if the trade was specifically set forth in a
written contract before the person acquired the inside information.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time the SEC has established an ``affirmative
defense'' against charges of illegal insider trading.
</P>
<P>
   It could be a godsend for executives who own a lot of company
stock and want to diversify their holdings but have a hard time
finding a window of opportunity to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Many firms prohibit officers, directors and some lower-level
employees from buying or selling stock during a period that
typically extends from two to four weeks before the end of a
quarter until a few days after the quarter's results have been
announced.
</P>
<P>
   This handcuffs insiders for up to 24 weeks a year. On top of
that, no employees can trade when they know about mergers,
management changes, factory mishaps or any other information that
could affect the company's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard for directors and officers of companies that
are active in the mergers-and-acquisitions market to find times
times when they  &LR; don't &LR;  know material nonpublic information,'' says
Brian Pastuszenski, a partner with the Boston law firm Testa
Hurwitz &AMP; Thibeault.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, executives could set up a regular program _ such
as selling 5,000 shares at the market price on the 30th day of
every quarter _ and avoid insider-trading charges, as long as the
program meets certain criteria.
</P>
<P>
   These plans can be altered, as long as the insider doesn't have
any material nonpublic information at the time the change is made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The SEC is essentially creating a safe harbor,'' Pastuszenski
says.
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news for insiders. The bad news is that if they
don't play by the rules, they could have a tougher time defending
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the SEC never had an insider-trading rule on the
books. Insider-trading cases were brought under the general
antifraud provision of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The
decisions in these cases established today's insider-trading laws.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC has long maintained that insiders were guilty of illegal
insider trading if they bought or sold stock while in ``knowing
possession'' of material nonpublic information. And for many years,
courts went along with the SEC's position.
</P>
<P>
   But two appellate courts, including the the U.S. Court of
Appeals in San Francisco, recently ruled that mere possession of
inside information was not sufficient to nail an insider. Instead,
these courts said prosecutors had to prove that the insider
actually ``used'' the information in making a trade.
</P>
<P>
   One of those courts, however, invited the SEC to adopt a
nationwide standard for insider-trading cases.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what the SEC did with Rule 10b5-1, which states: ``A
trade is on the basis of material nonpublic information if the
trader was aware of the material, nonpublic information when the
person made the purchase or sale.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the SEC replaced the conflicting ``use'' and
``possession'' standards with a new ``awareness'' standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The awareness standard reflects the common-sense notion that a
trader who is aware of inside information when making a trading
decision inevitably makes use of the information,'' the SEC says.
</P>
<P>
   It will take some time to see how courts interpret this new
wording, but most attorneys think it will get easier for the SEC to
win insider-trading cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Awareness is a lot closer to possession than use,'' says David
Levine, senior adviser to the SEC's director of enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC still must prove that an insider who traded stock while
in possession of a confidential document actually read it, he says.
On the other hand, the SEC can show that an executive was aware of
inside information, even if he didn't possess a document.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, awareness is a looser standard than possession,''
says attorney Jared Kopel, a litigation partner with Wilson Sonsini
Goodrich &AMP; Rosati.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks the SEC could argue that an insider knew his company
was going downhill ``because the breakfast doughnuts were canceled
. . . and there was a white board in the manufacturing department
that showed shipments were late.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sidener, a plaintiff's attorney with Gold Bennett Cera &AMP;
Sidener who represents shareholders in class-action suits, also
thinks the SEC will have an easier time prosecuting insider-trading
cases.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he thinks it will become easier for insiders
to defend themselves if they can argue their trades were part of a
preestablished plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as being helpful to executives,'' he says.
``There's still a lot of wiggle room.''
</P>
<P>
   Suppose an executive routinely sells shares on the 15th day of
every month. On the 13th, he discovers his company won't meet
earnings estimates. Instead of disclosing this information
immediately, he waits until after the 15th, following his
prearranged sale.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC's Levine says this is lawful, as long as the sale didn't
deviate from the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 10b5-1 didn't get much publicity because it was adopted the
same day the SEC announced its new ``fair disclosure'' regulation.
Reg FD says that whenever a company discloses material nonpublic
information to one or more analysts or shareholders, it must
simultaneously or promptly disclose the same information to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   The two regulations were unrelated. But Reg FD got more
attention because it was SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt's baby and
because the media likes it.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing in Reg FD that requires insiders to disclose
their trades any earlier than usual or to disclose information
before a preplanned trade is executed.
</P>
<P>
   Pastuszenski says Rule 10b5-1 ``has the potential to really
change the landscape,'' but only if executives are willing to
``give up some control of their portfolios'' and enter into regular
trading programs.
</P>
<P>
   From a shareholder's standpoint, the new rule is ``neutral to
positive,'' says Jesse Brill, chairman of the National Association
of Stock Plan Professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some companies, insiders have been reluctant to sell stock
for fear it would send a bad message to the marketplace. Now there
will be a cloak of legitimacy for people to engage in some of the
transactions they should be doing for financial and estate
planning.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he says, ``I don't think it will result in a lot more
selling. I think it will smooth over concerns that shareholders
have when they see insiders selling. Who knows, maybe these
services (that publish insider-trading activity) will put an
asterisk next to sales that are pursuant to an estate planning
program. It may smooth out some ups and downs in stock prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Gabele, director of insider research at First Call, warns
that insider sales are always difficult to analyze because
employees sell for all sorts of reasons. But he'd be concerned
about a company if a lot of executives suddenly embarked on
prearranged sales programs. ``If insiders think there's a ton of
upside in their stock, they are not likely to enter these plans,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   A second part of the SEC's new insider-trading rules affect the
families of insiders. I'm out of space, so more on that tomorrow.

   LOS ANGELES _ Question: I am in a sales/marketing position with
a manufacturing company, and I am considering changing jobs. I
informally met with a marketing manager from a dot-com company. I
am not a techie, but I am not ignorant in technology either. I
could hardly understand what this person was saying. The vocabulary
was almost completely foreign, and I am wondering if this is his
problem or mine? S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: So, this person said that you are on the radar screen,
depending on the build-out and soft launch, but only if the content
strategy was no longer tied to partner links in the application,
and this led to several questions about co-branding ahead of the
next build cycle or when the content server is ramped up and
deployed. Translation: Hello.
</P>
<P>
   You are absolutely correct that there is an entire dot-com
language out there, and if you are going to function effectively in
that community, you need to learn it. As a person with some
technical knowledge, you should be very close to being up to speed
already. At the same time, as you do more reading and spend time in
dot-com pursuits, your command of this language will only increase.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are some dot-communicators out there who use
their special vocabulary to exclude, impress, or even dominate
outsiders who want to be insiders. When you encounter dot-com talk
that puzzles you, do not be afraid to say that you do not
understand. This shows your interest in the subject, along with
your self-confidence and self-assurance, and these are add-ons that
should ramp up your marketability in the dot-community.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am an independent contractor and I was in the process of
lining up a project with a rapidly growing company. My contact
person was smart, organized, and supportive. Unfortunately, she had
to turn my project over to an individual who is impossible to deal
with. He won't return calls, he cancels meetings at the last minute
and he has all but shelved the project. What do you suggest? M.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: When a prospect gives any independent contractor or
salesperson second-class treatment, he is acting like a first-class
fool. Most of today's independent contractors and salespeople work
with client companies on a partnership/consultative basis, and to
treat them poorly by figuratively slamming a door in their face is
archaic and mean-spirited.
</P>
<P>
   Your original contact person obviously thought that your project
would meet some of the needs of the business. However, it is
possible that these needs have changed, and hence the company's
needs for your services have changed as well. The problem is that
you should be learning this in clear and specific language from
your prospect. But instead of giving you information, your prospect
is giving you the slip.
</P>
<P>
   The best step is to increase your assertiveness with this
prospect. Be very persistent in setting up a date and time to meet.
If he calls to cancel, do not get off the phone until another date
is set. It is time to get an answer from him, whether it is yes or
no. You should also consider calling your original contact with the
company. Perhaps she can let you know more about what is going on,
and she may also do some internal marketing for you.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I worked very hard over the past year and received an
outstanding review. My performance and contribution were definitely
above average, but my pay increase was the same as everyone else's.
When I voiced concern about this, my manager said that many
criteria are used in the process, and he thinks this is fair. How
does it sound to you? T.H.
</P>
<P>
   A: Your manager is correct in the sense that it is fair to use
various criteria in the raise determination process, but it sounds
like there is some of unfairness here.
</P>
<P>
   It is fine for your manager to say that many criteria are used
in the raise process, but you should know exactly what those
criteria are. If you are unfamiliar with some of the factors that
are playing a role in this process, that is unfair to you.
</P>
<P>
   Looking further at the fairness issue, there is a strong sense
of inequity associated with granting people the same amount of pay
for markedly different performance. In fact, one of the primary
sources of pay-related dissatisfaction is not one's pay level per
se, but the perception that others are doing less work or inferior
work while being paid the same or even more.
</P>
<P>
   Also from the fairness standpoint, it is not even fair to a
company to have a raise policy that generates dissatisfaction and
ill will. An equitable raise policy contributes to employee
satisfaction, motivation, and commitment, while an inequitable
raise policy contributes to dissatisfaction and turnover.

IRS SAYS PARENTS CAN CLAIM DEDUCTION FOR MISSING CHILD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Va., Minn.)   By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The IRS, which came under fire in Congress three weeks ago over
a legal memorandum that said the parents of a kidnapped child could
not receive a tax break for the missing child in years after the
abduction, reversed itself Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The original memorandum was written in response to a question
posed last April to the IRS by an unidentified parent whose child
was kidnapped and remains missing. It said Congress allowed the
parents to take an exemption for the child in the year of the
abduction but denied it in subsequent years because the parents
could not prove that they provided more than half of the child's
support. The memorandum said the ``the issue is not free from
doubt'' and noted that the only court case that touched on the
issue involved not an abduction by a stranger but the more common
case of a parent taking a child from an estranged spouse.
</P>
<P>
   The revised memorandum tiptoes around the issue of ``subsequent
years'' to the abduction by avoiding that language. The new
memorandum states that ``we believe it should ordinarily be
presumed that the parents have incurred sufficient expenses'' to
qualify for the exemption as long as the child remains missing and
no one else is legally qualified to take the deduction. Under the
law a kidnapper, even if he is the child's parent, cannot qualify
for the income tax exemption.
</P>
<P>
   Don Roberts, an IRS spokesman, said the general counsel's office
intended the revised memorandum to be read as allowing the
exemption in future years that parents would otherwise be entitled
to it.
</P>
<P>
   Two law school professors who specialize in family tax matters
said the language was not a clear reversal.
</P>
<P>
   John Barry Forman, a professor at the University of Oklahoma Law
School who specializes in family tax matters, said the agency ``is
still not giving the exemption away. A presumption doesn't go
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he expected auditors to read the revised memorandum
as making it clear that parents can take the exemption in the year
of the abduction and ``could stretch it to suggest, `OK, go ahead
and give it the next year or two,' but beyond that I would not take
too much comfort'' from the memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Thomas R. White of the University of Virginia Law
School, who is conducting a study of taxes and divorce, said he
concurred. Congress has limited the agency's discretion, he said,
so it ``used some weasel words'' to get around the statute.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who criticized the original IRS memo was Rep. Jim
Ramstad, a Minnesota Republican and a member of the House Ways and
Means Committee. On Sept. 6, he said that ``for the IRS to penalize
parents of missing and abducted children is as low as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRS ruling is anti-family, cruel and heartless,'' he
added. ``On top of more pain and devastation than a family can
bear, the IRS is now forcing a tax hike on the families of missing
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramstad and about two dozen other lawmakers have sponsored a
bill that would allow parents in such circumstances to take the
exemption until a kidnapped child's 18th birthday or until he or
she is declared dead.
</P>
<P>
   Karin Hope, Ramstad's legislative affairs director, said the
congressman did not think the fault lay with Congress and that
existing law gave the IRS sufficient discretion to grant the tax
break without his bill.

 &HT;    Taylor reaches finals of 400-meter hurdles
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - Maybe no one starts out to be a hurdler. Who really
wants to make running any harder than it has to be? Hurdling just
happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurdles were the last thing Angelo was going to try before he
gave up (track). He had tried all the other events. When he got
over that first hurdle without any trouble, he just kept with it,''
said Subrena Glenn-Everett, who as Angelo Taylor's mother was there
for every step. She was seated in Sydney's cavernous Olympic
Stadium, so try to guess where this is going.
</P>
<P>
   From a 12-year-old's last-chance event to Olympic final, just
nine years later. Atlanta's Taylor got through Monday's 400-meter
hurdle semifinal, finishing second in his heat to advance to
Wednesday's eight-man medal race.
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult to read Taylor's mood as he left the track.
Head down, looking to neither side, he walked directly off the
track, ignoring reporters requests for a synopsis. The body
language spoke of a runner who was either focused or unsatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   It is just as difficult to try to read anything into a semifinal
time or performance. The world's No. 1-ranked 400-meter hurdler
finished with only the seventh-best time among all qualifiers
(48.49). He seemed to labor at the close of his semi, vainly
chasing South Africa's Llewellyn Herbert.
</P>
<P>
   Running with Herbert might be good experience for the final. The
two are old acquaintances. They have met four times this year and
Herbert has won three of those. Taylor's single victory was in the
largest of the meets, Zurich. Come Wednesday, Taylor has his final
2000 Olympic opportunity at Herbert and six others.

IN LIEBERMAN'S OWN PARTY, PRESSURE TO EXIT SENATE RACE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Nev., Pa., Conn., N.D., S.D., N.J., Ga., Ind., Mont.)  By ERIC SCHMITT with RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Democrats growing more confident about their
chances of regaining control of the Senate this fall, several
colleagues of Sen. Joseph Lieberman are pressuring him to let
another Connecticut Democrat seek his seat so that the party will
not lose it if he becomes vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he is campaigning as Vice President Al Gore's
running mate, Lieberman is also seeking a third term in the Senate,
which he is entitled to do under state law.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic strategists and senators said that two senior
Democrats, Harry Reid of Nevada and Byron Dorgan of North Dakota,
had approached Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic
leader, to ask Lieberman to step aside. Daschle rebuffed their
appeals, aides and senators said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who heads his party's
re-election efforts, said this month on NBC's ``Meet the Press''
that the ``right decision'' for Lieberman would be to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   If Lieberman wins his Senate campaign and the vice presidency,
he would give up his Senate seat and Gov. John Rowland, a
Republican, would be able to appoint his replacement. That would
cost the Democrats a Senate seat, at a time when they are trying to
narrow the Republicans' 54-46 advantage. Under state law, the
interim senator appointed by the governor would serve for two
years, with a replacement chosen in the 2002 general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge worry that we could pick up four seats and then
lose the Senate because Joe hasn't stepped down,'' said one Senate
Democrat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``It's one of
the main topics among Democratic senators.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Democrats picked up four seats and won the White House,
the party could control narrow votes in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has explained his decision to continue his Senate
campaign by saying that there would not be enough time to hold a
primary so voters could choose a replacement candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the replacement would be chosen by the 72-member state
Democratic Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, Lieberman has until Oct. 27 to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's intent to seek a third term scared away all of the
best-known, best-liked potential Republican Senate candidates,
leaving the field to Philip Giordano, the mayor of Waterbury, who
lacks money and name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Democrats mentioned most often is Richard Blumenthal,
the state attorney general who could step in and be heavily favored
to beat Giordano. The oddity of Lieberman's dual political identity
was on full display Monday, as he shifted for a day from the
national campaign to stump in Connecticut for his re-election.
Responding to questions about it, he referred to polls that showed
voters by a slight margin opposed his dual candidacy. He and the
voters have ``agreed to disagree'' on that point, he said, while
noting that polls show him with an overwhelming lead over Giordano.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Senate Democrats say their hopes of recapturing
control have been buoyed by new polls _ which Republicans have
quickly challenged with surveys of their own _ showing Democratic
candidates closing the gap in states the party had discounted or
even written off, including Montana, Pennsylvania and Nevada. These
hopes also shot up when former Gov. Zell Miller of Georgia was
named to replace Sen. Paul Coverdell, a Republican who died in
July.
</P>
<P>
   This boost also coincides with the post-convention surge enjoyed
by the Gore-Lieberman ticket against their Republican rivals, Gov.
George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' strong showing in the presidential race, however,
has fueled fears among Lieberman's colleagues. While few if any
have made their concerns known directly to the senator, several
Democrats spoke to a reporter Monday on the condition of anonymity,
knowing their remarks would reach him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish Joe would step aside,'' said one Democratic senator.
``As his likelihood of success becomes more apparent, that seat of
his could make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Senate Democrat said, ``I would certainly say he should
take a hard look at it in 10 to 12 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Ind., said, ``I have heard a lot of chatter
about it, but ultimately it's up to him and his conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Lieberman would say only that the senator ``has felt
great support from his colleagues,'' and referred all other
questions to Daschle.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Daschle defended Lieberman's decision: ``He's
had a very impressive record in the Senate for 12 years. To throw
away something that's a sure thing, another term in the Senate, for
the possibility of a new position of vice president is a choice and
decision that only he can make.''
</P>
<P>
   As he campaigned in Connecticut Monday, Lieberman faced a
barrage of questions about his balancing act.
</P>
<P>
   Might he change his mind? Didn't he worry about a Republican
taking his seat? Was he hedging his bets against a possible loss by
Vice President Al Gore?
</P>
<P>
   The senator handled the questions calmly, saying that while the
people of Connecticut are split over his decision, polls show that
they overwhelmingly favor his re-election. Last week, a Quinnipiac
College poll showed that 46 percent of voters opposed Lieberman's
double campaign and 45 percent supported it. But he enjoys an
extraordinary 80 percent approval rating and leads his Republican
opponent, Giordano, 72 percent to 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I understand this is an unusual situation and I
appreciate the questions that people in Connecticut are asking,''
he said, after a stop at the Harbour Park Restaurant in Middletown.
``I and my extended family in Connecticut, that is, the people of
Connecticut have agreed to disagree, but ultimately, I'm heartened,
deeply heartened, and grateful by their response in the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has called for a change in the state law, so that a
special election would be held next year, rather than 2002. Rowland
said last week that he would veto such a bill, but that, Lieberman
insisted, had not shaken his resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not change my view, and hopefully, the Legislature and
the governor will work on this if it becomes necessary to work on
it next year,'' he said. ``I still think that the best course is
for there to be a special election, should I be fortunate enough to
be elected vice president, there should be a special election early
next year, giving enough time for party nominations, full open list
of candidates, primaries if that's required, and then a good debate
and election of a successor.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore his dual demands, Lieberman took time out
from a day ostensibly devoted to his re-election to attend three
fund-raisers for the Democratic National Committee, which raised
more than $3 million.''

 &HT;    Cheney pounds Gore on oil interests
 &HT;    By Joy Heselton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ohio _ Republican Dick Cheney went on the offensive
Monday, accusing Vice President Al Gore of an oil-related conflict
of interest as Cheney visited a Springfield airplane parts plant.
</P>
<P>
   The vice presidential candidate said that in June Gore advocated
extending a moratorium on royalties U.S. companies are required to
pay to drill for oil in the Gulf of Mexico, while a Gore family
trust fund owns stock in Occidental Petroleum Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time (Gore) did this, it was clear that perhaps the
biggest beneficiary of that proposed extension of the moratorium
was Occidental Petroleum,'' Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   Oil has been back in the news since President Bill Clinton's
decision last week to open up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an
effort to reduce fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney called on Gore to abstain from making energy-related
decisions in his role as vice president, or else the family trust
fund should sell the Occidental stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush and Cheney have been carrying water for their friends in
the oil industry and they are obviously on the defensive about
that,'' Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway told the Associated Press in
response to Cheney's criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney retired last month as the chief executive officer of
Halliburton Co., a Dallas-based oil services company and has been
criticized by Democrats for his industry connections.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney raised the issue after making a speech about a tax-cut
plan to about 60 employees of the Eagle Tool and Machine Corp. on
Montgomery Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which employs about 90 people in Springfield,
manufactures spare parts for both military and commercial aircraft,
including a landing gear component for the warfare EA-6B Prowler
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney told Eagle Tool employees that their decision in this
year's presidential election was key to the future of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might set the tone and the direction of the country for the
next 25 years,'' Cheney said, a lifesize American flag hanging over
his left shoulder on the wall of the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney accused Gore and running mate Sen. Joe Lieberman,
D-Conn., of not understanding how the economy works in the United
States because neither of them have spent any time in the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really believe government is the engine that drives our
economy. I don't,'' Cheney said. ``I think what drives our economy
are 270 million Americans who get up every day and go to work and
give a day's work for a day's pay.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice presidential candidate also took a tour of Eagle Tool
and spent some time talking with a local ``typical working family''
during his visit. Cheney highlighted the differences in the way
Texas Gov. George Bush's and Gore's tax plans would affect that
family.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Powell, a corporate training and safety manager at Ohio
Stamping and Machinery Inc., and his wife, Dawn, an artist at Olan
Mills, make a combined income of $69,000 per year and pay $7,628 in
federal income taxes. The Powells have two children, ages 15 and
11.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Bush plan, the Powells would pay $5,195 in federal
taxes, a 32 percent cut, Cheney said. The family would pay $7,236
in taxes, only a 5 percent cut, under the Gore plan, Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed a $1.3 trillion tax cut over 10 years to
virtually all who pay federal income taxes. Gore's plan calls for a
$480 billion tax cut over the same period, but he offers cuts to
low- and middle-income families who are paying for specific special
expenses, such as higher education or disability care for a
relative.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at the Eagle Tool and Machine Corp. called the Bush
plan attractive after hearing from Cheney on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all good if it works out. But you know what they say,
talk is cheap,'' said machinist Jim Lookabaugh. The 37-year-old
said he is leaning toward supporting the Bush/Cheney ticket, but
has not decided who he will vote for in November.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Keeton, a machine maintenance officer, said tax reform is
needed. Keeton, who is married and has three children, said he
doesn't often see the benefits from his tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's something that needs a lot of attention because I
pay out a lot in taxes,'' Keeton said.

 &HT;    Cheney tours tornado-stricken town
 &HT;    By Joy Heselton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   XENIA, Ohio _ Republican vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney
congratulated rescue workers and community leaders in Xenia on
Monday for their response to Wednesday's devastating tornado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm impressed with how quickly the county has responded,''
Cheney said. ``I've seen these situations before, but this is one
of the more dramatic ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by Xenia Mayor John Saraga and Ohio Gov. Bob Taft,
Cheney toured damaged areas of the city, including the Dayton
Avenue Baptist Church, which lost much of its roof, and West
Richard Drive where bare foundations and piles of glass and
building debris mark are all that's left of several houses.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Davis, an American Red Cross worker, thanked Cheney for
coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closer you got, the better the weather got,'' Davis said,
referring to a temporary let-up in a steady rain that had fallen
for much of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Taft announced Monday that he has asked President Bill Clinton
to declare the city a federal disaster area, making residents
eligible for federal assistance funds and low-interest loans.
</P>
<P>
   The F4 tornado, with winds of more than 200 mph, damaged more
than 300 homes and businesses and destroyed more than 100, causing
more than $5 million in uninsured damages, Taft said.
</P>
<P>
   He said it could be days or a week before Clinton determines
whether to grant the state's request.
</P>
<P>
   Moses Bynum took a timeout Monday from clean-up work as an Ohio
Department of Transportation machine operator to shake hands with
Cheney and have his picture taken with the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-year-old Xenia resident said he and about 170 ODOT
employees from across the state have been working since Wednesday
night to clear buildings and streets hit by the tornado.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't the first time Bynum has been so employed. He's been
involved in cleaning up after other storms, including a tornado
that hit Blue Ash last year.
</P>
<P>
   But this tornado was personal for Bynum. His two sons,
21-year-old Robert and 20-year-old Samuel, ducked into the CD
Connection near Wal-Mart when they saw the tornado coming. A pile
of rubble is all that's left of the store now, although his sons
survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Cheney seems to be a nice person,'' Bynum said. ``They
seemed to be concerned. It was good to have somebody of his status
there who would stop and take the time and check on people.''

U.S. SAYS ASYLUM IN PANAMA HELPED AVERT A COUP IN PERU 
</HEADLINE>
  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American officials Monday defended their role in
pressing Panama to give refuge to the ousted intelligence chief of
Peru, asserting that his departure was necessary to avoid a
military coup by officers loyal to him.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials confirmed that the intelligence chief,
Vladimiro Montesinos, has had a longstanding relationship with U.S.
intelligence agencies. But they said the contacts were informal and
had no bearing on the efforts to help him settle in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Even as administration officials insisted that Montesinos'
departure was important to helping Peru remain on a path toward
democracy, human rights groups voiced skepticism. They criticized
the United States for seeking to arrange a soft landing for
Montesinos outside Peru, where it may be more difficult to
prosecute him for widespread abuses that were reportedly carried
out under his command.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos, who was a top adviser to President Alberto Fujimori
for a decade, sought political asylum in Panama on Sunday, 10 days
after the release in Peru of a videotape in which Montesinos
apparently sought to bribe an opposition lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has announced that he will step down next year after
holding new elections and that he will abolish the National
Intelligence Service. Montesinos had headed the agency, which was
implicated in numerous cases of extortion, human rights abuses and
even killings.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian authorities have granted Montesinos a 30-day tourist
visa and have retained his passport, officials said. The decision
to let him remain was made after appeals from the Organization of
American States and six Latin American presidents, as well as
telephone calls from Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering.
</P>
<P>
   A senior American official said Peruvian army officers loyal to
Montesinos had given numerous signs, beginning last week, that they
would attempt a coup against Fujimori unless they received an
``ironclad guarantee'' that Montesinos would be given safe haven
outside Peru.
</P>
<P>
   American officials were specifically concerned about a military
celebration, Armed Forces Day, that was held as planned on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as U.S. and Latin American diplomats struggled to
defuse a confrontation between supporters of Fujimori and
Montesinos, army leaders loyal to Montesinos sounded out the
nation's two vice presidents to gauge their support for a coup, but
were rebuffed, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos' loyalists in the army and the national police agreed
to sign a document in support of Fujimori's government only after
they had seen U.S. and Latin American leaders' efforts for
Montesinos.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts on Peru and human rights advocates voiced
skepticism about the rationale for granting Montesinos safe haven.
Cynthia McClintock, a political scientist at George Washington
University, said Montesinos' military support in Peru was shallow,
limited to several senior army officials. She raised the prospect
that the CIA might have been eager to remove Montesinos from Peru
as he increasingly faced the prospect of prosecution there.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the CIA, Mark Mansfield, declined to discuss
Montesinos' ties. An American official insisted, however, that the
intelligence agency did not play a role in arranging Montesinos'
exit.
</P>
<P>
   A regional specialist for Human Rights Watch/Americas, Jose
Miguel Vivanco, called the coup threat groundless and said the
United States and other nations of the region were promoting
impunity for a major violator of human rights. ``This shows how
powerful Montesinos is, how he managed to get full support of the
Peruvian government and the sympathy of key governments in the
region, including the U.S., to find a nice sweet deal for him,''
Vivanco said.
</P>
<P>
   Vivanco's organization said Montesinos had ordered numerous
crimes, including the ``disappearances,'' torture and executions of
nine students and a professor from La Cantuta University in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such allegations, Montesinos drew praise from some
American officials for helping eradicate a threat posed by
guerrilla organizations in Peru and cooperating with American
anti-drug efforts.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the State Department, Richard A. Boucher,
acknowledged Washington's role in persuading Panama to accept
Montesinos. But he challenged the idea that the administration was
standing up for anti-democratic forces in Peru. He also left open
the possibility that Montesinos could eventually be prosecuted.

In 1983, the morning sickness drug Bendectin was removed from the
market amid a barrage of lawsuits claiming that it caused birth
defects. Now, in what medical and legal experts say is an
unprecedented reversal of fortune, it may well be brought back. A

and Drug Administration to gain permission to market a generic

 &HT;    Mets still mettlesome in NL race
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Cue the German Shepherds. Stoke the trash can fires
in the parking lot. A steady drizzle is predicted for Flushing,
N.Y., tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Mets-Braves live from Shea Stadium. It's Armaggedon II.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a fine place to visit,'' Reggie Sanders said.
``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the weather forecast, this trip may well not be so
stormy, for all the Braves need do is win once in these next three
games and the NL East is decided. Though the magic number is
officially 3, the Braves only need one victory to take the season
series from New York and hence, the division title.
</P>
<P>
   Currently 6-4 versus the Mets, Atlanta can clinch the series
with one more win. If the two clubs finished the regular season
tied, the Braves would be determined division champions based on
the first tie-breaking criteria _ head-to-head record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we're swinging the bats pretty good,'' manager Bobby Cox
said. ``But (tonight's starter Al) Leiter had a no-hitter going
into the sixth (in Atlanta last Wednesday).''
</P>
<P>
   ``Four games up with six left,'' said third baseman Chipper
Jones. ``It's not a guarantee but both teams know they're in. I
don't think you'll see the intensity of past (Mets) series.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves rolled out of Canada after taking three of four from
Montreal.Atlanta hit .318 in the four Expos games with six homers
and outscored them 34-11.
</P>
<P>
   That outburst however came against the NL's 13th ranked pitching
staff. The Mets are ranked fourth and are starting two
right-handers (Rick Reed on Wednesday and Bobby J. Jones
onThursday) as opposed to three lefties last week, which played to
Atlanta's strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (Montreal) was a more important series than the one in
New York,'' catcher Javy Lopez said. ``This one put us four up. Now
we go to New York and the worst that can happen to us is we lose
two out of three and we're still ahead. This is good.''
</P>
<P>
   At 93-63, the Braves are a season-high 30 games over .500 and
Monday's 6-0 win tied them with San Francisco for the best record
in the league. If the Mets are playing these three for the
division, the Braves are playing for the home field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty good feeling,'' center fielder Andruw Jones
said. ``We just have to keep playing like this.''

this is an unbelievable experience. And it's an honor to work on

his PBS broadcast show, ``The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer,'' and has

had no hesitation in picking Lehrer as the sole moderator of all
three of next month's matches between Vice President Al Gore and
Gov. George W. Bush which starts in Boston on Oct. 3. Like most
journalists about to moderate a presidential debate, Lehrer says he
has no political biases that might get in the way of the job
because he doesn't vote. Lehrer works at his desk at WETA studios

Maasiyahu Prison in Ramle, Israel holds Aryeh Deri, the leader of
the strictly Orthodox Shas Party of Sephardic Jews who has been
jailed since Sept. 3 for corruption. Since then the area near the
jail has mushroomed into a pilgrimage site where hundreds of people
gather nightly for a religious revival meeting. Some consider
Deri's imprisonment to be the latest example of oppression by a
secular elite of European background. Outside Maasiyahu Prison,
Deri's supporters hold a meeting in a tent. (Rina Castelnuovo/The

POVERTY-POLITICS-5 -- Poor people learn to keep hopes small. So
when President Clinton came calling on some of the poorest places
in the country last year with ideas to make things better, it was
like rain in the desert. The president's six-state, four-day
poverty tour, highlighting places that remain untouched by the
longest economic boom in this nation's history, caused an
excitement that bordered on the spiritual. A year later, the
president's modest proposals for tax incentives to bring businesses
to impoverished communities are still awaiting Senate approval.

For many black alumni, being at Harvard Law School meant feeling
like stepchildren or guinea pigs in an experiment where neither the
school nor the students felt confident of the result. But last
weekend, as school officials stood before them and declared, ``This
is your school,'' many black alumni said they felt for the first
time that maybe it is. About 600 had returned to campus -- a number
of them for the first time in 20 or 30 years -- to celebrate the
law school's first black alumni weekend. Across the country,
colleges and universities are adding similar black-oriented events
to their roster of fall homecomings. Relatives of Harvard Law

-- Jim Lehrer, 66, interviews public figures five nights a week on
his PBS broadcast show, ``The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer,'' and has
been doing so for 25 years. The two main presidential candidates
had no hesitation in picking Lehrer as the sole moderator of all
three of next month's matches between Vice President Al Gore and
Gov. George W. Bush which starts in Boston on Oct. 3. Like most
journalists about to moderate a presidential debate, Lehrer says he
has no political biases that might get in the way of the job
because he doesn't vote. Lehrer works at his desk at WETA studios

Washington Mayor Anthony A. Williams, left, backed by Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, and Eleanor Holmes Norton, center, the city's

closed after the 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma
City. Williams unveiled an architectural plan by the firm of

 &HT;    Drugs get spotlight in Sydney Olympics
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ With each swirling rumor and new drug scandal, the
Sydney Olympics are on the verge of earning a legacy as the most
tainted Games ever _ or at least for most thoroughly exposing the
underbelly of sports.
</P>
<P>
   All told, six positive drug cases have been reported _ triple
the number in Atlanta four years ago. And that doesn't count a
significant number of athletes who were left home by nations that
feared they couldn't pass drug tests in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The doping issue assumed new urgency Monday amid serious charges
of cover-ups of positive tests by the U.S. track federation,
following reports that shot putter C.J. Hunter, the husband of
track star Marion Jones, tested positive for steroids this summer.
</P>
<P>
   That startling development was followed by news that Romania's
Andreea Raducan was stripped of her all-around gymnastics gold
medal after testing positive for a banned stimulant.
</P>
<P>
   Three Bulgarian weightlifters have also lost their medals,
including Izabela Dragneva, the gold medalist in the women's
105-pound event, while a hammer thrower from Belarus and a rower
from Latvia have been expelled for positive drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, everyone's favorite athlete is under suspicion when
they pedal fast or jump high. And when performances don't measure
up to the performances of past champions _ as was the case in the
shot put last week _ it raises the question of inadequate testing
at previous Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just shows we're all clean,'' said shot put bronze
medalist John Godina.
</P>
<P>
   At past Olympics, the real scandal had not been that athletes
succumb to the pressure to go higher, faster, farther through
chemistry. It had been, rather, the reluctance of sports
authorities to institute tight drug-testing policies and to impose
tough sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the word was out early that drug testing at the Millennium
Games would be serious business. The IOC boasted that the
drug-testing lab would be the best ever at an Olympics, that
athletes were subject to both random out-of-competition tests and
blood tests.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Games, 27 Chinese swimmers were cut from their team
because of fears they would not pass drug tests in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan, Canada, Norway, Kenya, Bulgaria, Belarus, Romania,
Germany, Iran, Kazakhstan and the Czech Republic all removed
athletes who tested positive.
</P>
<P>
   No issue has cut to the heart of the Olympics like doping.
Fairly or unfairly, it casts doubt over highly successful athletes.
And often it pits country against country in the politics of sport.
</P>
<P>
   International sports officials roundly criticized the American
track and field federation for failing to immediately disclose
Hunter's positive test, leading to speculation that they didn't
want to jeopardize his wife's quest for five gold medals. Many of
those same officials were pleased when a Sydney newspaper, citing
sources, reported Hunter's suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the first time such a problem arises in the U.S. with
the national athletic federation,'' said Prince Alexandre de
Merode, head of the International Olympic Committee's medical
commission.
</P>
<P>
   As the Hunter story unfolded, de Merode raised the accusation of
U.S. track and field officials covering up five positive drug tests
before the 1988 Seoul Olympics. He said five American athletes
tested positive before the Seoul Olympics ``and were enlisted at
the Games. We learned this from the U.S. team doctor at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent ill will toward the United States also has some basis
in White House drug policy director Barry McCaffrey's criticism of
the International Olympic Committee's handling of the drug issue _
while, at the same time, the U.S. Olympic Committee and its sports
federations are seen as no better. At a world anti-doping
conference in February 1999, McCaffrey clashed publicly with the
IOC over its efforts and the need to be more open.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey's blunt plea for openness was mentioned Monday, in
light of the U.S. track federation's ``no comment'' about Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reaction to Mr. McCaffrey was sort of representative of
many others in the sports community,'' said Arne Ljungqvist, the
chief anti-doping official of the international track federation.
``That we felt strange to be told by Americans what to do and how
to behave, when we all knew and experienced over the years a
problem with American regulations.
</P>
<P>
   International officials frequently accuse the United States of
being too protective of its athletes, fueling suspicion the
Americans have used athletes who had tested positive for drugs at
this and previous Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Masback, head of the U.S. track federation, said no
members of the Sydney team had tested positive.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the case in Atlanta, where distance-running great
Mary Slaney represented the United States at the 1996 Games even
after she had tested positive for elevated levels of testosterone
at the trials. It was a year after the Games that her test was
reported, and her two-year suspension was over before she exhausted
all her appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Ljungqvist accused U.S. track officials last week of withholding
information on 12 to 15 positive samples in the past two years.
Masback said it's simply a misunderstanding between the
federations.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is what constitutes a positive test. When athletes are
tested, the urine samples are divided into an ``A'' and ``B''
sample before being sent to the laboratory. To confirm a positive
``A'', the ``B'' sample is later tested.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. track federation doesn't make a public disclosure
unless both tests come back positive and until appeals are heard.
Thus, the U.S. federation still refuses to confirm that Hunter is
the subject of a positive test.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confidentiality is very important for fairness,'' Masback
said. ``It's the difference between the civil and common law
system. It's the notion of innocent till proven guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Ljungqvist acknowledged the U.S. legal system complicates
enforcement of IAAF rules, adding: ``It does not prevail in other
parts of world, and other parts of world have not had a problem
adopting IAAF regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has long been a target in international
sporting circles, at least partly because of a perceived
superiority _ from sending the largest Olympic contingents to
winning the most medals. In doping, the United States stands
accused of a holier-than-thou attitude, while at the same time not
playing by the same rules and failing to report positive drug
tests. The Olympic Games have always been a flash point for the
doping issue. The most notorious case involved Ben Johnson, the
Canadian sprinter stripped of his gold medal and world record in
the 100-meter dash after testing positive for steroids at the 1988
Seoul Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The hoopla around Hunter is nearly as large, as it casts a
shadow over Jones and her quest to make history in Sydney. But even
before the competition started, suspicion was heightened when
several prominent athletes withdrew after organizers announced they
would test for EPO, a drug that benefits endurance athletes. Only
two athletes flunked tests for steroids at the Atlanta Games, while
the IOC ignored five other samples that were detected by high-tech
equipment and found to contain banned strength-builders. An
arbitration panel threw out the disqualifications of five other
athletes who tested positive for using a stimulant.
</P>
<P>
   Questionable drug testing dates back to the 1984 Games in Los
Angeles. Dr. Don Catlin, a UCLA professor who assisted in the
Atlanta lab and oversaw drug testing in L.A., said that nine
positive tests turned up ``missing'' after the Los Angeles Games.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Olympics track coach Pat Connolly told a Senate
judiciary committee she believes ``at least 40 percent of the
(U.S.) women's team in Seoul had probably used steroids at some
time in their preparation for the Games.'' None of the Americans
tested positive.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, talk of pharmacology and positive drug tests is bad for
Olympic business, bad for sports federations who scrounge for
funding, and a reason why their keepers stand accused of coverups
and shoddy methods.

this is an unbelievable experience. And it's an honor to work on
issues that matter.'' ``Medicare at the Crossroads,'' the 74-page

POVERTY-POLITICS-5 -- Poor people learn to keep hopes small. So
when President Clinton came calling on some of the poorest places
in the country last year with ideas to make things better, it was
like rain in the desert. The president's six-state, four-day
poverty tour, highlighting places that remain untouched by the
longest economic boom in this nation's history, caused an
excitement that bordered on the spiritual. A year later, the
president's modest proposals for tax incentives to bring businesses
to impoverished communities are still awaiting Senate approval.
Once a thriving commericial street, Issaquena Avenue in Clarksdale,
Miss., now has few surviving businesses. Clinton visited Shirley

in the country last year with ideas to make things better, it was
like rain in the desert. A year later, the president's modest
proposals for tax incentives to bring businesses to impoverished
areas are still awaiting Senate approval. The fact remains that
very poor people still live along the back roads of Appalachia, in
houses that look like abandoned barns. Some of them even live right
on the roads for all the world to see. Jesse McWhorton, 15, in

When President Clinton came calling on some of the poorest places
in the country last year with ideas to make things better, it was
like rain in the desert. The president's six-state, four-day
poverty tour, highlighting places untouched by the longest economic
boom in this nation's history, caused an excitement that bordered
on spiritual. A year later, the president's modest proposals for
tax incentives to bring businesses to impoverished communities are
still awaiting Senate approval. Of all the jobs in Jackson County,

George W. Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, getting set

in the grips of an ``education recession'' even as it enjoys good
economic times. Timed to coincide with Bush's trip is a new
Republican National Committee ad citing low test scores,
particularly in math and science. It implies that part of the blame
rests with the Clinton-Gore administration. It also praises Bush's
record in Texas. Bush and his wife Laura leaving Austin-Bergstrom

JEWELRY MARKET JUST TOO CROWDED FOR MIADORA.COM 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN SAID  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Miadora.com, an online luxury jewelry store, has
ceased operations, according to Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Barry Gilbert. The San Mateo, Calif., company, which had
about 75 employees, laid off its entire workforce on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Miadora, which aspired to be the Tiffany's of the Web, was among
a throng of luxury-goods sites that opened for business just a year
ago. Other online jewelry sellers include Mondera, BlueNile,
IJewelry and Ashford.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of how crowded the online jewelry market had become,
Miadora in February bought Jewelry.com, a Southern California
online seller of more-moderately priced jewelry, even though that
site was only 3 months old.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had twinkling predictions for the online jewelry
market. In June, research firm International Data Corp. predicted
that jewelry e-tailers could take in $179 million this year and hit
annual sales of $1 billion by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   But the glut of companies may have been too much. ``There is
room for probably only a couple of companies in each category
online,'' said Barry Parr, director of e-commerce research at IDC
of Mountain View. ``I think the net effect (of so many online
jewelry firms) was to divide up the market to an extreme degree.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Parr said, the spoils in online jewelry may fall to
bricks-and-mortar companies. ``Zale's and Tiffany could wind up
with the bottom and top of the market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Miadora joins a long litany of e-tailers that have either shut
down or laid off staff this year. According to Chicago outplacement
firm Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, 4,805 dot-com workers lost their
jobs in September. The total number of Internet-related layoffs
this year has hit 16,590, according to the report. The layoffs were
dispersed among 217 companies, 37 of which failed.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Internet bubble burst on Wall Street in April,
Miadora had no problems lining up funding.
</P>
<P>
   It raised a first round of $6.2 million from Sequoia Capital and
private investors last summer, followed by $25 million from
Amerindo Investment Advisors, Pivotal Asset Management and others
in September 1999. In early April, it scored another $20 million,
led by equity investment firm Freeman Spogli &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Now, according to sources, Miadora will be liquidated by
Comdisco Ventures, another of its investors. Comdisco declined to
comment, as it is filing registration papers for an IPO.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert, Miadora's chief executive, was widely credited with
helping turn around Sharper Image during 21/2 years as vice
chairman and chief operating officer. Previously, he was an
executive at Warner Bros. Studio Stores.

AT 38, EWING IS `A FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH' AT SUPERSONIC INTRODUCTION
</HEADLINE>
  By TOM SPOUSTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A highlight film preceded his entrance, offering
archival evidence of Patrick Ewing in his prime, back when he could
finish a fast break with an inspiring dunk and an emphatic scowl,
or spin swiftly past an opponent and drop a baby-finger roll into
the bucket.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing's era in New York officially ended Monday when the former
Knicks center attended a news conference here and draped a green
and white SuperSonics jersey in front of his 38-year-old frame,
symbolically removing himself from the team he led for 15 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing sat, looked again at his new No. 33 jersey and gave a
reflective smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new start for me. It's like fresh air,'' Ewing said.
``Sometimes, change can be like the fountain of youth, another
chapter in your life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to kid you, I am nervous. I've been in New York
15 years and on the East Coast my entire life. But this is a
challenge and an opportunity I'm looking forward to.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first public statements since the four-team, 12-player
and four-draft-pick trade _ the biggest in National Basketball
Association history _ Ewing gave no hint of animosity toward the
Knicks, calling his departure a mutual decision. He talked of
playing into his 40s and finishing his career as a Sonic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell me that I'm old and ancient, but I think I left my
wheelchair back in New York,'' Ewing said. ``I felt I have a lot of
basketball left in me. My goal is to play as many games as I can,
stay healthy and rested and be ready for the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing added: ``Athletically, I'm not where I was back in my
prime, but mentally, I'm much better. When I think about what I
knew back then and what I know now, I realize how great I could
have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can still play. I can still make a contribution. I can still
help a team win. I'll be ready to play when they throw the ball
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing said that he requested a trade last spring, shortly after
the Knicks had lost to the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, management agreed to shop him around the league.
Ewing's agent, David Falk, said the Sonics were high on his
client's list of five or six teams.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Sonics' mission was to acquire a true center to go
with their all-stars Vin Baker and Gary Payton. The acquisition of
Ewing means the 6-foot-11-inch Baker can now play power forward.
</P>
<P>
   With Ewing in the middle, Payton can become even more of a
daring playmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our priority was to get bigger and stronger,'' said Wally
Walker, the Sonics' president and general manager. ``We had a good
team, but we needed more. This trade transformed our franchise and
our roster.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing stopped short of saying he was the last piece to the
Sonics' championship puzzle. But when asked about his dream
scenario in Seattle, he said he envisioned the one victory party
that had eluded him as a Knick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where will you have the parade when we win it all?'' Ewing
asked Sonics Coach Paul Westphal. ``My best-case scene is us
winning the championship and me finally getting to ride on that
float. I know it's now going to be Fifth Avenue, but I want to know
what it's like to have all that confetti dumped on my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Had he not been traded, Ewing said he would have remained a
loyal Knick and reported for duty as he did for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't have been difficult,'' Ewing said. ``I would have
went in and did my job and tried my best to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no ill feelings or will toward the Knicks. They have
compensated me well over the years. I wish I could have brought
them a championship, but it didn't happen. I still respect
everybody there. I just felt it was time for me to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing said it was a combination of things that made him request
the trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely going to miss the Garden,'' he said. ``I'll
miss a lot of the fans and my friends. We had good times and bad
times, but for the most part, I loved being there.''`
</P>
<P>
   Ewing will be in uniform next Monday when the Sonics open
training camp. The Knicks face the Sonics here on Nov. 14. Ewing's
first road game in Madison Square Garden will be Feb. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in a videotaped interview from the Olympics in Sydney,
Australia, Baker and Payton agreed that the addition of Ewing
should make the Sonics contenders for the Western Conference title.
</P>
<P>
   ``He better get a lot of ice for his knees, because we're going
to want him to run a bit,'' Payton said. ``With Patrick, people are
going to expect a lot from us. Now we can play with the Portlands
and the Lakers and bang with their big men. We're going to be able
to go deep in the playoffs.'' &QL;

FDA REJECTION OF CANCER DRUG SENDS DEVELOPER'S STOCK DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a fabled story in the biotechnology industry. Floyd
Nichols, a computer salesman and entrepreneur who had a rare
disease that leads to colon cancer, heard of a drug that might save
his life. When he could not interest a pharmaceutical company in
developing the drug, he formed his own company. And although it was
too late for Nichols _ he died of cancer in 1996 at age 43 _ the
drug is now being used experimentally to treat his son, Eric, who
also has the disease.
</P>
<P>
   But the story may not have a happy ending. The company Nichols
started, Cell Pathways, said Friday that it had been told by the
Food and Drug Administration that the drug would not be approved.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement put Cell Pathways' stock into free fall on
Monday, with the shares losing two-thirds of their value. The stock
closed at $9.31, down $20.69, with 12.8 million shares changing
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Towarnicki, president of Cell Pathways, said in a
conference call with investors on Monday that the company had not
yet received a letter from the FDA outlining the agency's reasons
for rejecting the drug. The FDA, as a rule, does not comment
publicly on applications it is considering.
</P>
<P>
   Cell Pathways, based in Horsham, Pa., was seeking approval to
sell the drug, Aptosyn, to treat familial adenomatous polyposis, or
FAP, the hereditary disease that Nichols had. The disease causes
hundreds of precancerous growths called polyps to form in the
intestine, leading almost invariably to colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But Aptosyn, which can induce pre-cancerous or cancerous cells
to destroy themselves, a process known as apoptosis, is also being
tested to treat or to prevent several more common types of cancer,
including colon cancer, prostate cancer and breast cancer. Cell
Pathways executives said in the conference call that the company
would continue with clinical trials for those diseases and that
they were encouraged by those trials and by animal studies that
seem to show the drug is effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current event is a regulatory event rather than a
scientific or medical event,'' said Rifat Pamukcu, the company's
co-founder and chief scientific officer, referring to the FDA's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if Aptosyn is not approved for FAP, it could take another
year to three years for Cell Pathways to get a drug on the market,
company executives said in the conference call. But perhaps the
biggest risk for investors is that the problems the FDA has found,
will also hurt prospects for Aptosyn to be approved for other
cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Cell Pathways suffered a setback in February 1999 when Aptosyn,
known generically as exisulind, failed to show a statistically
significant difference compared to a placebo in treatment of
familial adenomatous polyposis. But the company reanalyzed its data
and treated more patients with the drug. Its stock had nearly
tripled in the last year before losing virtually all of that gain
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrex, the popular arthritis pill made by Pharmacia Corp.'s
Searle division, earlier this year became the first drug approved
for FAP. Before that, treatment was basically limited to surgically
removing the polyps or the entire colon.

   A British chemicals maker, Laporte PLC, said it would sell 60
percent of its business to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co., the U.S.
buyout firm, for $1.2 billion in cash. The disposals are the latest
in a line of restructuring efforts dating back to 1996, and will
leave Laporte focused on its fine and performance chemicals
business. Among the businesses being sold are pigments, additives,
compounds, water technology, timber treatment and electronics,
which had operating profit before exceptional items of 83 million

   The London Stock Exchange argued in its official defense
document that the takeover bid from OM Gruppen, the Swedish company
that runs the Stockholm exchange, would represent a loss of
influence, inadequate value and an unattractive business
proposition, and it urged shareholders to reject the hostile bid.
London exchange shareholders, the document asserted, would own just
18.5 percent of the merged entity, even though the exchange would
contribute nearly half of the new group's profits. In the wake of
its failed plan to merge with the Deutsche Bourse, the London
exchange has been the subject of merger speculation.  &QL;

the way they compile their indexes. Elliott Flynn, a senior analyst
in ING's London office, said $155 billion might flow out of Asian
equity markets as a result of the changes, which assign new weights

TALK OF EURO'S REVIVAL MAY BE PREMATURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ As a show of market power, the joint
intervention to rescue the euro seems not to have impressed its
audience much.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, on the first full business day after major central banks
intervened in the currency markets to revive the downtrodden
European common currency and threatened to do so again, the markets
barely reacted.
</P>
<P>
   The euro, the currency adopted by 11 European nations nearly two
years ago, traded throughout the day around 88 cents to the dollar,
and weakened to 87.30 cents to the dollar in late New York trading,
compared with 87.87 cents late Friday. That is still about 3 cents
above its low and well below what some European officials consider
its true value.
</P>
<P>
   As finance ministers and central bankers from around the world
attended annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank here Monday, there were new signs that the American
leaders are less worried than Europeans about reversing the euro's
decline.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected decision by the United States to join the rescue
attempt on Friday surprised investors and lent further credibility
to the European Central Bank's move. Japan and Canada intervened,
as well.
</P>
<P>
   But the tone of American statements was more ambivalent than
that of European bankers. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers
insisted over the weekend that the United States had not changed
its view that ``a strong dollar'' is in the interests of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst Welteke, president of Germany's central bank, let it be
known Monday that he and other German officials were frustrated by
Summers' remarks, as they seemed to undermine the use of future
interventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought the remarks of Larry Summers had not been very
helpful,'' said Rolf-Ernst Breuer, chief executive of Deutsche
Bank, who met with Welteke and other senior German officials here
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   European leaders made clear that they wanted to do more than
simply stop the decline of the euro, which has lost about 25
percent of its value against the dollar since the currency's
introduction in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Finance Minister Laurent Fabius of France
emphasized the need to achieve a higher rate.
</P>
<P>
   Wim Duisenberg, the president of the European Central Bank,
talked about achieving an ``orderly reversal'' in the euro's
decline.
</P>
<P>
   Because a failed intervention would do greater damage to the
euro's credibility than no intervention at all, it is hard to
imagine that the European Central Bank will not act again.
</P>
<P>
   European officials meeting here in Prague said repeatedly in the
last couple of days that they would intervene again if it was
appropriate and made clear that the euro's current value is nowhere
near the level they want.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no hint of a follow-up campaign Monday, nor was
there any anxious repositioning of portfolios by currency traders
in anticipation of one.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the pressure, European officials are preparing for
another blast of bad press on Thursday when Denmark votes on
whether to adopt the euro. Recent polls show the Danes almost
evenly divided, but the euro's decline in the last few weeks
appears to have strengthened opponents.
</P>
<P>
   While a Danish rejection of the euro might have little immediate
impact on its trading value, it could increase resistance in the
two bigger countries that have stayed out of the monetary union,
Britain and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it would be bad news for the euro,'' said Klaus
Friedrich, chief economist at Dresdner Bank. ``Right now, all news
about the euro is bad news.''
</P>
<P>
   The more fundamental problem, analysts say, is that the euro's
weakness does not lend itself to a quick fix through central bank
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Intervening on behalf of a currency generally works best if a
large number of speculators have already been betting heavily in
one direction, because central banks can often squeeze out traders
with a short but intense bout of buying in the other direction.
</P>
<P>
   But the euro's core troubles are reflected in long-term
investment flows, and may stem from the effects of corporate
mergers and acquisitions as well as portfolio investments. In
general, those investments have been pouring out of Europe and into
the United States, reflecting higher American growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the long-term flows that are leaving the country,'' said
Tony Norfield, chief currency analyst at ABN Amro, ``not the mad
speculators. There are very few positions out there to squeeze.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that money managers, particularly in Asia, bet too
heavily in favor of the euro. Many did so initially because they
liked the idea of having an alternative to the dollar, but they
continued on the mistaken conviction that the euro was overdue for
a rebound after its early declines.
</P>
<P>
   Those expectations were kindled by almost all major bank and
investment banks, which were consistently over-optimistic about the
euro's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Axel Siedenberg, head of economic research at Deutsche Bank,
said the goal of intervention is not so much to strengthen the euro
as to keep it from sinking further. And that, he said, is an
attainable goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intervention was not intended to start a new trend toward
a strong euro,'' Siedenberg said. ``The message to the market is
that this is the bottom.''

2 PENSION FUNDS SEEK MEETING WITH AT&AMP;T OVER STOCK SLIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The comptrollers of the state and city of New York,
representing pension funds for public employees that are among the
largest shareholders in AT&AMP;T, have requested a meeting with its
chairman to discuss the company's long-term prospects.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to C. Michael Armstrong, AT&AMP;T's chairman and chief
executive, state comptroller H. Carl McCall and city comptroller
Alan G. Hevesi also expressed concern over AT&AMP;T's sagging share
price and options the company's management is debating to improve
its fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the public officials highlights the distress with
which some of AT&AMP;T's largest institutional shareholders have
witnessed an erosion of their investments in one of the the
nation's leading telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   Battered by concern over the relatively slow growth of revenue
from services like long-distance calling, AT&AMP;T's share price has
declined by more than 50 percent this year. On Monday AT&AMP;T stock
fell to a 52-week-low of 28.63 before rebounding slightly to close
at $28.81.
</P>
<P>
   The New York State Common Retirement Fund holds more than 11.8
million shares of AT&AMP;T's common stock, while the New York Pension
Funds and Systems hold about 13.3 million shares of common stock.
Together, they own less than 1 percent of the company's outstanding
shares, according to information AT&AMP;T made available at the end of
June.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the pension funds are substantial investors in the
company. For example, John C. Malone, the former chairman of
Tele-Communications who is the largest individual shareholder,
owned approximately 32 million shares at the end of the
second-quarter, only about 7 million more shares than the combined
New York pension funds.
</P>
<P>
   At AT&AMP;T's annual strategy session late last week, the company's
board reportedly discussed a variety of strategies, including an
alliance with British Telecommunications, an acquisition of Nextel
Communications, a wireless carrier, and the issuance of a new
tracking stock. None of these options seemed to inject optimism
into investors' perception of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long-term investors we want to be assured that the options
are being considered to promote growth and stability in the
long-term, and not simply to produce a short-term boost in the
stock price,'' McCall and Hevesi said in their letter.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, AT&AMP;T's chairman, received the letter but declined to
comment on its contents or whether a meeting with the funds has
been scheduled. ``We understand McCall and Hevesi have concerns
about our share price within a situation affecting not just our
company but the sector as a whole,'' said David Couette, an AT&AMP;T
spokesman. ``So are we.''

SENATE PUSH TO TOUGHEN DRUNK-DRIVING STANDARD STALLS TRANSPORTATION
BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to correct figure in third graph)  
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A major fight has erupted in Congress over a
proposal to force states to adopt a more stringent standard for
drunk driving, under the threat of losing millions of dollars in
federal highway aid.
</P>
<P>
   The fight has held up agreement on a massive transportation
spending bill that provides money for highways and mass transit
systems and that also pays for air traffic controllers, the Coast
Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board, which
investigates air crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Under a provision of the Senate's $54.8-billion version of the
spending bill, people whose blood alcohol level is .08 percent _
meaning that eight-hundreths of one percent of the liquid in their
blood stream is alcohol _ would be considered to be driving under
the influence. On average, a 170-pound man generally reaches that
blood-alcohol level by consuming five 12-ounce beers in two hours,
and a 120-pound woman by drinking three 12-ounce beers in that
time. The Senate bill, which was sponsored by Senator Frank R.
Lautenberg (D-N.J.) and passed in June, would require states to
adopt this standard within three years. If states decline to adopt
the standard, they would lose 5 percent of their Federal highway
funds the following year, another five per cent the next year and
10 per cent the year after that.
</P>
<P>
   Currently 18 states and the District of Columbia use the .08
percent criterion to define drunken driving, while 30 others set
their standard at the higher level of .10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Two states, Massachusetts and South Carolina, do not set a
specific blood-alcohol level for drunken driving but leave it up
the judgment of the arresting officer.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate negotiators are meeting this week to resolve
differences between the Senate bill and a $55.2-billion House
transportation measure that does not contain the .08 percent
blood-alcohol level requirement.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has drawn powerful antagonists in the restaurant
industry and provoked complaints from some states that the Federal
government should not be dictating requirements to them. Opponents
of the proposal cite evidence to argue that is not clear that
lowering the blood-alcohol level will save as many lives as its
proponents claim.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the last year in which complete statistics are
available, 38 percent of all traffic fatalities nationally involved
a driver who had been drinking. Of the 18 states and the District
of Columbia that have adopted the .08 percent standard, 9 had
alcohol-related fatalities greater than the national average, 8 had
alcohol-related fatalities that were below the national average and
two were at the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the tougher standard, including the Clinton
administration, argue that it will save 500 lives a year. They
point to studies that indicate that drivers exhibit significant
impairment, including slowed reflexes, at blood-alcohol levels even
lower than .08 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen at least eight studies dealing with impairment that
found that, on average, these laws have resulted in a 6 to 8
percent reduction in crashes,'' said Rodney Slater, the secretary
of transportation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Clinton administration, the law has drawn
support from groups like Mothers Against Drunk Driving &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried for over 10 years to have this standard adopted in
many states,'' said Millie Webb, National President of Mothers
Against Drunk Driving, whose 19-year-old nephew and 4-year-old
daughter were killed in 1971 by a driver whose blood-alcohol level
was .08 percent. ``That's why we have to have a federal mandate.
The general population knows you're too impaired at .08. But it's
the special interest that the legislators listen to, especially in
the committees.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is of great importance to groups like the Wholesale
Beer Distributors and the American Beverage Institute that
represents restaurants with liquor licenses. Of the more than
191,000 full service restaurants that provide table service, more
than 111,000 of them sell alcoholic drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists representing the restaurant industry say the new
mandate will force states to shift resources away from catching
people who are seriously drunk to concentrate on drivers who are
only mildly impaired.
</P>
<P>
   Also fighting the Senate provision are the National Governors

SOTHEBY'S STOCK RISES AFTER CLASS-ACTION CLAIM IS SETTLED 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shares of Sotheby's Holdings rose more than 15
percent Monday after the board of the beleaguered auction house
agreed to pay $256 million to settle a class-action claim that it
colluded with Christie's to fix commissions charged to buyers and
sellers.
</P>
<P>
   The board's action, taken Sunday, also set off speculation that
the company was more ripe than ever for a takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Sotheby's rose $3.13, to $23.44.
</P>
<P>
   A. Alfred Taubman, the company's largest shareholder and former
chairman, agreed to pay $156 million of the auction house's
settlement cost. Of the $100 million Sotheby's has to pay, $50
million can be in the form of certificates offered like lines of
credit to future sellers.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the agreement, which is now before a federal judge
for review, the privately held Christie's also has to pay $256
million.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have had little interest in Sotheby's stock for some
time. Its price nosedived after a federal investigation into
collusive practices gathered steam last January.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a stock no one cared about yesterday,'' said George
Sutton, a managing director of Dain Rauscher Wessels in
Minneapolis. ``But today they do because now that there's been a
settlement something has to happen to the Taubman shares.''
</P>
<P>
   Speculation that Sotheby's might be sold has been rife ever
since Taubman, a 75-year-old real estate magnate and the majority
shareholder, resigned as chairman in February amid accusations that
he set commission fees with his one-time counterpart at Christie's,
Sir Anthony Tennant. Sotheby's and Christie's are part of the
ongoing federal antitrust investigation.
</P>
<P>
   While Sotheby's may still have another big check to write to
settle its case with the Department of Justice, officials at the
auction house said they believed that sum would not be as large as
the $256 million payment.
</P>
<P>
   The stock is far from its high last spring of $46.75 a share,
but Ronald Baron, chairman and chief executive of Baron Capital,
the company's largest outside shareholder, with a $500 million
holding, said he was pleased with yesterday's settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It removes a cloud from the company,'' he said. ``But I don't
think I've made much so far. I bought the stock for a little over
$20 a share.''
</P>
<P>
   James M. Meyer, director of research at Janney Montgomery Scott,
the Philadelphia investment firm, said that despite its current
woes, Sotheby's has many valuable assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the two trusted entities in the art world and a
company with access to the richest people in the world,'' he said.
``The message now is that the shoe that hasn't dropped _ the
criminal side _ is about to.''
</P>
<P>
   This, he said, could precipitate a change in ownership.
``Shareholders are eager to find somebody else to run the
business,'' he said. ``Like the Yankees, it's a franchise worth
owning.''

PLAN BY RUSSIAN METALS PRODUCER OUTRAGES SHAREHOLDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SABRINA TAVERNISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's Norilsk Nickel, the world's biggest palladium
producer, sought Monday to allay growing investor anger over a
reorganization plan that minority shareholders call a brazen move
to dilute their stakes.
</P>
<P>
   The company last week surprised investors with the plan, which
has already reduced the size of their holdings through a series of
share issues and purchases that nobody outside senior company
management had even known about.
</P>
<P>
   The company today pledged it would take steps to limit
shareholders' dilution and tried to persuade investors the
reorganization would ultimately increase the value of Norilsk
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've stolen our wallet and are promising to give most of it
back,'' said a Moscow-based portfolio manager who holds Norilsk
shares and asked to remain anonymous. ``But the bottom line is that
they've stolen it.''
</P>
<P>
   The manner in which Norilsk disclosed the reorganization and the
angry response from shareholders illustrates one of the most
persistent problems in Russia's evolution toward a market-driven
economy _ poor corporate governance. Although the economy is
growing for the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union
serious problems remain among many privatized Russian companies. As
they become more profitable and valuable, the problem of corporate
control becomes worse, pitting large owners against minority
shareholders in bitter property fights. While the new government is
racing to reform Russia's legal system, many inconsistencies and
loopholes remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows yet again that there is a very high risk for
shareholders here,'' said Svetlana Smirnova, a metals analyst at
Renaissance Capital investment bank in Moscow. ``It explains why
Norilsk shares are priced at only half their true value. In the
West, you wouldn't see half a restructuring carried out without
shareholder notification.''
</P>
<P>
   The central element of the company's restructuring is in the
value of a metal trading company called Norimet, which Norilsk
purchased last April in exchange for a stake in its most valuable
subsidiary. That subsidiary, called Norilsk Mining Co., produces
most of Norilsk's revenue and owns all its valuable licenses.
Analysts said Norilsk management cheated investors out of a fair
price for the stake by assigning too high a value to Norimet, which
sells Norilsk's metals on world markets.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in July, the subsidiary issued new shares, further
reducing the stake owned by shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, these shareholders, which include major Western
investment funds, lost more than two thirds of the subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   The company argues the changes will help make Norilsk more
efficient and reduce its tax liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shareholders will get a smaller piece of a more delicious
cake,'' said Alexander Khloponin, Norilsk's general director, at a
news conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company's reorganized plan continues to raise
questions. Khlopinin admitted Monday that among Norimet's previous
owners was Norilsk's majority shareholder, Interros, indicating
management has given away company value to itself.
</P>
<P>
   Interros is a financial group, which includes a bank, machinery
producer and media companies. It is controlled by Vladimir O.
Potanin, a businessman who amassed his fortune during Russia's
economic free-for-all in the early 1990s. Minority shareholders own
about 30 percent of Norilsk. Its share price has fluctuated wildly
on the news, losing up to 20 percent last week and gaining more
than 14 percent Monday. Interros owns about 60 percent.

TESTAVERDE BRISTLES OVER BEING BLINDSIDED BY BENCHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Skedded earlier as Jets-George.)  
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Wayne Chrebet was at the center of one circle
of reporters Monday, joking about the 100 e-mail messages he had
received on his Web site after Sunday's shocking 21-17 victory over
Tampa Bay, including the one that suggested a new moniker for him:
the Green Lantern.
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away, Curtis Martin reviewed the details of his
winning touchdown pass to Chrebet, likened by Keyshawn Johnson to a
flashlight compared to his aura as a star. Martin was talking about
how his own defense had teased him in practice last week that he
would give away the play by shucking the glove he wears on his
right hand as the ball was about to be snapped. Martin successfully
removed it finger by finger and was now talking about the Jets'
upcoming bye week with all the glee of a teen-ager approaching
spring break.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Jets were filled with jubilation over their
franchise-best 4-0 start and their elite standing as one of only
three undefeated teams remaining in the National Football League,
there was one player in the Jets' locker room Monday who was
noticeably not smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Testaverde had seemed downcast in the moments after the
Jets' come-from-behind victory Sunday and his mood had not improved
with the trip home. Testaverde, who threw three interceptions in
the game and endured an embarrassing and surprising one-series
benching, was still chafing at Coach Al Groh's move to relieve him
after he was halfway onto the field and alluded Monday to other
vague problems he hoped to address during the bye week. Testaverde
usually measures his words carefully, but Monday his irritation was
plain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't pleased at all,'' Testaverde said of his benching and
the circumstances surrounding it. ``I'm really not, to be honest.
There is nothing I can do about it. The moment it happened I didn't
know if I was going back. I just kept saying to myself, he's making
a big mistake taking me out. Because I really believe the fourth
quarter belongs to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I was disappointed, but not necessarily in how I was
playing,'' he said of his postgame demeanor. ``Some things I don't
need to discuss but they'll get worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde had been on the sideline, unaware that he was about
to be benched, collecting his thoughts for the next drive. He
looked at the clock, and 7 minutes 57 seconds remained. He figured
that all the Jets needed was a touchdown, a 2-point conversion and
a field goal to tie the game. Testaverde did not know he was coming
out of the game until he had already stepped on the field to start
the next drive and turned to the tight ends coach Ken Whisenhunt to
get the play. That is when he heard someone yelling that Ray Lucas
was in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The person he heard was Groh, who said he became so wrapped up
in being on the phone with the defensive coaches during the
defensive stand that he had failed to tell his quarterback he was
giving him a rest. Groh took responsibility Monday for that lapse
in communication. Groh said he yanked Testaverde because he had
looked in his eyes as he came off the field after throwing his
third interception and saw profound frustration. He heard it in the
voices of his offensive coaches and players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think the third quarter had gone too great,'' Groh
said. ``One of the things that the opponent had feasted upon is
teams getting frustrated and impatient against them. I had gone
back to players on the bench during the third quarter and said,
`Don't get frustrated.' So when I sensed there was frustration, I
thought we'd try to remove that frustration and not hustle right
back out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Groh insisted again Monday that he planned all along to put
Testaverde back in the game no matter what Lucas did on his drive.
The Jets went three-and-out on that drive as Lucas threw a pass to
Richie Anderson for 5 yards, was sacked for a 6-yard loss and then
scrambled up the middle for 9 yards. Testaverde, who had received
moral support from several of his teammates during his time on the
sideline, returned. But what if Lucas had given the Jets the spark
that Groh obviously sought?
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wasn't thinking far enough ahead,'' Groh said. ``I
just put Ray in and I was planning on putting Vinny in.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Groh sense Testaverde's anger at the decision to bench him,
albeit temporarily?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't try to sense anything,'' Groh said. ``I had my plan
in mind. The actions and results speak for what the plan was. With
the game on the line, who was in the game?''
</P>
<P>
   For that, Testaverde credits linebacker Bryan Cox. Testaverde
said there was ``no question'' in his mind that he had been pulled
for the day but that Cox went over to Groh and said, ``If we lose,
we lose with Vinny.'' Cox confirmed that account. The move paid
off. Testaverde completed 8 of 9 passes for 44 yards on the drive
that resulted in a 6-yard touchdown pass to Martin to pull the Jets
to 17-14.
</P>
<P>
   Groh said he did not think there was anything to smooth over
with Testaverde, and compared his benching to that of left tackle
Jason Fabini after he accumulated four penalties in the season
opener against Green Bay. Testaverde is 16-2 in the regular season
as a starter, but he has not put together four quarters of
outstanding play this season. He has completed 77 of 155 passes
(49.7 percent) for 911 yards with six interceptions and six
touchdowns. His overall quarterback rating is 64.7. But in the
fourth quarter, Testaverde has completed 26 of 38 passes (68.4
percent) for 360 yards, four touchdowns and only one interception.
His rating is an astonishing 122.7.
</P>
<P>
   Groh was guarded in his comments about Testaverde's play but, in
an early effort to tamp down any chance of a quarterback
controversy, said Lucas would not get more snaps in practice than
usual.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Testaverde frequently floated balls and underthrew
receivers, but he pointed out Monday that he was 10 of 20 in a
first half that he felt was marred only by the interception at
Tampa Bay's 5-yard line with 22 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have had better performances,'' Testaverde said.
``The last four weeks, I feel what I've brought to the team in the
fourth quarter is somewhat discredited by what the perception is of
what I've done in the first three quarters. I'd much rather have a
big fourth quarter than a big first quarter. The standard is high
because of how I played in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also said my performance will be determined by how good my
team plays around me _ not necessarily only the players. People
have to be accountable, players and coaches. The better we all
perform, the better we all look. Period. There are things we need
to take care of that will be fixed.'' &QL;

MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS DRUG EFFECTIVE IN EARLY STAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   By DENISE GRADY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Researchers have shown for the first time that the onset of
multiple sclerosis can be delayed, and its severity reduced, by
drug treatment for neurological problems thought to be very early
signs of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment consists of weekly injections of Avonex, also
called interferon beta-1a, which is already used to treat multiple
sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   In the new, three-year study, Avonex reduced the rate of
development of the disease by about half in patients who were
considered to be at very high risk because of symptoms that did not
themselves meet the definition of the disease, but that often
preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Reingold, vice president for research programs at
the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, who was not part of the
study, said: ``Nobody has ever tried an intervention this early in
the course of the disease for somebody at high risk for developing
multiple sclerosis. The results are both clinically and
statistically significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Reingold emphasized that the study did not continue long enough
to show that Avonex prevents multiple sclerosis, but only that the
drug delays its onset.
</P>
<P>
   About 250,000 to 350,000 Americans, two to three times as many
women as men, have multiple sclerosis. It is an autoimmune
disorder, in which the patient's immune system attacks the nervous
system. It destroys myelin, the protective sheath around nerve
fibers in the brain and spinal cord, and gradually damages the
nerves themselves. Although it is not commonly fatal, it can cause
permanent weakness, paralysis, cognitive problems and loss of
eyesight and memory.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment, in which half of 383 patients got placebos and
half took Avonex, had to be halted a year ahead of schedule because
data revealed that the Avonex group was doing so much better. All
patients were then offered the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study was so positive it was unethical to continue it,''
said Dr. Lawrence D. Jacobs, head of neurology at Buffalo General
Hospital and director of the research, which was conducted at 50
hospitals in the United States and Canada from April 1996 until
March 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Patients in the study had all had one episode of neurological
symptoms, including double or cloudy vision, and problems with
balance, strength, sensation or bladder or bowel control. They also
had brain lesions suggesting myelin damage that showed up on
magnetic resonance imaging.
</P>
<P>
   According to the current definition of multiple sclerosis,
patients do not have the disease until they have two such episodes
at different times, affecting different parts of the brain, and
until other conditions like brain tumors and lupus are ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, those who have had only one episode are considered
at high risk.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 383 patients in the study, 193 got Avonex and 190 got
placebos. Over three years, 76 in the placebo group developed the
disease, as opposed to only 46 in the Avonex group.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, made by Biogen, costs about $10,000 a year. But
because it has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration
for full-blown MS and not for patients merely at risk, some
insurers may not cover it. But Jacobs said the company has asked
the drug agency to extend the approval to high-risk patients.

<P>
   If you wanted a house fit for a children's picture book, you
could do no better than Mia Farrow's home in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Snow White, happening upon it, would say it was perfect,
especially for a large family: Down a hill on a dirt road you go,
and there, behind a white picket fence and an overgrown English
garden, is a pretty old farmhouse, with little rooms with low
ceilings. There's a goldfish pond in front, a small lake in the
back, four dogs, chickens in a coop, a cat. Even the name is
storybook perfect: Frog Hollow.
</P>
<P>
   We are talking an older and wiser and financially independent
Snow White here, by the way: Snow White at 54 in baggy jeans and an
old Gap T-shirt, with 70 choice acres in Litchfield County and more
of a sense of humor than you might think. A Snow White who had
relationships with famous men that were not always wonderful, who
lost one of her 14 children to death earlier this year, who calls
up her friend Carly Simon to congratulate her on her song about her
mastectomy scars. Snow White in middle age, with a bemused and
cautious attitude about the press.
</P>
<P>
   Duty is the reason she's talking now, doing the celebrity
spokeswoman thing.
</P>
<P>
   The cause is polio, a conference on the Global Polio Eradication
Initiative, which the United Nations Children's Fund has called for
Tiesau at the U.N. The goal is eradication of polio by 2005. It
seems to be working: In 1988, there were an estimated 350,000 cases
worldwide; last year, an estimated 20,000, but would you be paying
attention if not for the chance to get a look at Mia and find how
she can afford to raise all those kids? (Answer, offered dryly:
``Well, I work sometimes. I just did a movie for Showtime. You
probably haven't noticed.'')
</P>
<P>
   Farrow, who had polio when she was 9, is speaking at the
conference. She will be accompanied by her adopted son Thaddeus,
12, who was abandoned at a Calcutta train station as a young child.
He also had polio. His legs are scarred from dragging himself on
the ground. He gets about today with braces or a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Farrow suffered no serious physical damage. But sitting on her
back porch, she talks about being isolated in a polio ward for
three weeks. She was allowed no physical contact with her family.
Orphaned, in a sense; she heard adults scream, and she saw other
children die.
</P>
<P>
   She is not a believer in psychoanalysis. If you want to theorize
about the effects of having had a father (the director and writer
John Farrow) who was brilliant, alcoholic and a womanizer and a
mother (the actress Maureen O'Sullivan) who soothed and placated
and kept the family together or to tie that to an actress who
married or became involved with talented, difficult men (Frank
Sinatra, Andre Previn, Woody Allen), you're on your own.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of polio, Farrow will discuss. ``I believe it's why
I wanted to be a mother to a child who had the disease. I theorize
those weeks in the hospital gave me perhaps a social conscience,
the beginning of empathy, maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   A bit of self-apology, which sometimes flares up. ``Of course,
I'm only theorizing, but it was such an eye opener. I had not
realized, growing up in Beverly Hills, that such things existed.
I'm sure that's why I have the children that I have, children with
disabilities. The number I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the big questions: Why does Mia Farrow keep
adopting children? There are five now at home, ranging from 5 to
15.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's not continuing,'' Farrow says. ``I come from a
large family, there were seven of us. I raised seven children and
began a second family of seven again.''
</P>
<P>
   A mild complaint. ``It's always odd to me that I have to defend
my sanity in those circumstances. If I kept 100 racehorses would
anyone think I was crazy? Not that I'm comparing children to
racehorses.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other big questions, of course, which relate to
Farrow's 11-year relationship with Woody Allen: the ugly custody
battle with allegations of child abuse regarding their adopted
daughter Dylan, then 6, and Allen's marriage to Farrow's adopted
daugher Soon-Yi. The subject hovers about like a rude guest who
everyone wishes would leave and yet must be acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Aren't people sick of the subject? Farrow asks.She's sick of it.
She does say a few things: She tried to make contact with Soon-Yi
but was rebuffed. None of her children have contact with Allen, by
their choice. That includes the son Allen and Farrow had together,
who is 12 and attends college.
</P>
<P>
   A happier subject seems called for. You were married, at 19, to
Frank Sinatra. Most people had to put on Sinatra, you had Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't sing to me,'' Farrow says, her voice suggesting it's
wearing to be a celebrity spokeswoman. ``But he was pretty
terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   Warming up to the memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would do scales, before he was gonna sing some place. Jimmy
Van Heusen would come over and he would vocalize, but I don't think
it's the same thing as singing to some one. Did anyone ever sing to
you?''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, lots of times.
</P>
<P>
   Then, ``Who?''
</P>
<P>
   Guys who wanted to be Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   Farrow, now laughing: ``And they're free now? He was a very cool
guy, he would never do anything he thought was uncool, and I think
he would think singing to someone was uncool. It wasn't like he was
Nelson Eddy. And God knows I was no Jeanette MacDonald.''

SIXTH DUKE OF SUTHERLAND, 85, ART COLLECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH LYALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The sixth Duke of Sutherland, a Scottish landowner who
held one of the largest private collections of old master paintings
in the world, died on Thursday. He was 85 and lived on the family
estate near St. Boswells, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   The duke's collection, inherited down the line from a long list
of wealthy and acquisitive ancestors, comprised some 500 paintings,
including Rembrandts, Poussins, Raphaels and Titians, many of which
had been in the family for more than 200 years.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what will happen to the works, said a spokesman
for the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh, where 27
paintings from the collection were placed on permanent loan in the
1940s, with another one added in 1994. Francis Egerton, the duke's
heir, a cousin who inherits his title and his estate, has not made
his plans known.
</P>
<P>
   John Sutherland Egerton was born on May 10, 1915, into a world
of privilege and great wealth. His ancestor the first Duke of
Sutherland was one of the richest men in the world in the 19th
century and put his family's already impressive art collection,
some of which had belonged to Louis-Philippe, the Duc d'Orleans, on
view to the public in 1806.
</P>
<P>
   The duke, who was known as Lord Ellsemere until 1963, when he
inherited the dukedom from his cousin Geordie, held many lesser
titles. He was also the Marquess of Stafford, Earl Gower, Viscount
Trentham, Viscount Brackley and Baron Gower.
</P>
<P>
   He was not, however, the Earl of Sutherland, a position
inherited from the fifth Duke of Sutherland by another branch of
his large and complicated family. Despite all his titles, he was
too shy to ever take his seat in the House of Lords or enter much
into public life.
</P>
<P>
   The duke was educated at Eton and at Trinity College, Cambridge,
and parachuted into Crete with the Royal Armored Corps in World War
II. He was captured by the Germans and spent several years in a
succession of prison camps, an ordeal that increased his shyness
and reticence.
</P>
<P>
   The family's proud art collection was kept in Bridgewater House,
its London home, but was sent to Mertoun House, the estate on the
Scottish Borders, in 1944 when the sixth duke inherited the
artworks, along with the earldom of Ellesemere, from his father.
Soon afterward, the gallery at Bridgewater was struck and
devastated by German bombs. The sixth duke sold the house,
overlooking Green Park, after the war to pay estate duties.
</P>
<P>
   When asked some years later how he had responded to this sudden
inheritance, the duke merely said, ``Responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The duke was forced to sell many of his family's treasures over
the years to raise money. In the 1970s he sold a group of old
master drawings at auction and later a number of works by Turner,
Van Dyck and Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   The duke took part in local politics, was a keen fishermen and
maintained his family's tradition of racing and breeding
racehorses.
</P>
<P>
   He never had children, and was married twice, to Lady Diana
Percy, who died in 1978, and then to Evelyn Moubray, a former
interior decorator who shared his love of fishing. She survives
him.

CELTIC STABBED FIVE TIMES IN NIGHTCLUB ALTERCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Pierce, considered one of the Boston Celtics' rising stars,
was stabbed more than five times during an altercation early Monday
inside a Boston nightclub, according to the police.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce, a versatile 6-foot-7-inch, 220-pound swingman who played
guard and forward last season, underwent surgery for wounds to his
face, neck and back at the New England Medical Center. A hospital
spokesman said Pierce was listed in fair condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing fine. We're all hoping for a speedy recovery,''
Celtics Coach Rick Pitino told The Associated Press as he left the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report on the Boston radio station WEEI-AM, the
injuries to Pierce, a 22-year-old former Kansas All-American, did
not appear to be so grave as to threaten his career. Pierce
averaged 19.5 points for the Celtics last season and was second in
the National Basketball Association in steals with 2.08 a game.
</P>
<P>
   WBZ-TV in Boston reported that Pierce had been hit over the head
with a bottle and that most of the stab wounds were superficial
except for a 7-inch-deep cut to his sternum.
</P>
<P>
   Boston police said the stabbing took place around 1 a.m. Monday
in a poolroom at the Buzz Club in the city's theater district.
Pierce, who was scheduled to report for training camp next Monday,
was attending a private party with friends, including another
Celtics player. Several stations and The Associated Press reported
that the player was Tony Battie.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce was driven by friends to a nearby hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Mariellen Burns, director of information for the Boston Police
Department, said Monday that no arrests had been made. She said the
police were looking into statements made by witnesses that the
incident might have involved associates of the Boston rap group
Made Men.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Pierce decided to forgo his senior year at Kansas to
enter the NBA. He was drafted by the Celtics in the first round. In
his rookie season, he started 47 of the 48 games he appeared in and
averaged 16.5 points, 6.4 rebounds and 1.71 steals. He was named to
the all-rookie first team.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Monday, Kansas Coach Roy Williams
described Pierce as ``one of the greatest young men I have ever
been around.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am shocked and saddened by last night's events,'' he said.
``I have been in contact with the Celtics people and the hospital
and I expect to be in touch with the family later today. Right now,
it's just too early to tell what the final word on this will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Chenowith, a junior center at Kansas who played with
Pierce, said he was surprised when he heard about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a happy-go-lucky guy,'' Chenowith said in a statement
released by the college. ``He always jokes around with guys, always
has a smile on his face. From what I heard he was breaking
something up, and that's totally in the character of Paul to break
something up.'' &QL;

   More than 90 people have died in a cholera outbreak in Badghis,
a drought-affected northwestern Afghan province. At least 20,000
Afghans need emergency health aid, the United Nations office in
Kabul said. The drought, the worst in three decades, has caused

MRS. CLINTON WILL STILL RAISE SOFT MONEY FOR DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DEAN E. MURPHY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton said Monday that she would
continue to help raise soft money for the Democratic Party even
though she had agreed with Rep. Rick Lazio not to allow
advertisements in their New York Senate race paid for with the
largely unregulated money.
</P>
<P>
   Answering questions at a news conference in Manhattan, Clinton
said that she had helped raise money over the years for Democratic
candidates and that she would continue to do so because ``I believe
in the Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that she had promised the party that she would
participate in additional fund-raising activities before the
election on Nov. 7 _ a pledge, she said, not affected by her deal
with Lazio to ban the use of soft money in their television and
radio advertising. Campaign officials said Clinton would be out of
the state on Thursday and Friday raising money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to fulfill my remaining obligations to the
Democratic Party in the coming weeks, to fulfill the commitments I
have made to help raise money they believe is important in using in
other races,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that she would have no say in how the soft money
she raised would be spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not my money,'' she said. ``It is the money of the
Democratic Senate Campaign Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, still buoyant after pressing Clinton to accept the
restrictions on soft-money advertising, tried to keep the issue
alive by appearing at Battery Park in lower Manhattan with Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., who has been a leader of campaign finance
reform in Congress. McCain, standing beside Lazio at the Navy war
memorial with the Statue of Liberty in the distance behind them,
congratulated both candidates on the deal and urged all campaigns
for federal office to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be an example for all campaigns in America,''
McCain said, ``and it's an important step in getting rid of the
evil and pernicious and corrupting influence of the so-called soft
money.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain suggested that the deal came just in time because
several groups were prepared to begin raising and spending soft
money on behalf of Lazio, who has not raised any of his own soft
money. ``I know that there were people who were prepared to give
unlimited amounts of money to the Lazio campaign, because I've
talked to them,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan McLagan, a spokesman for Lazio, said he did not know which
groups McCain was referring to, adding that the congressman was not
raising soft money.
</P>
<P>
   The deal struck between the two candidates remained fragile,
however, and Lazio's campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, described it
Monday as tenuous. He wrote a letter to the Conservative Leadership
PAC, a supporter, to persuade the group to abide by the agreement.
Other independent groups, like the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League, are meeting this week to decide
whether to comply.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had tried to steer the day's news away from the debate
over soft-money spending and toward more friendly ground. She had
called the news conference to criticize the Palestinian leader,
Yasser Arafat, for ``sowing the seeds of future hatred.'' The
questions about soft money came only after she issued a strong
rebuke of Arafat for not removing anti-Semitic references in
Palestinian schoolbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Clinton visited the Margaret Tietz Center for
Nursing Care in Jamaica, Queens, where about half of the residents
are Holocaust survivors. She was joined by Rep. Tom Lantos,
D-Calif., a Holocaust survivor, who used the opportunity to cast
Lazio as a right-wing Republican trying to persuade New Yorkers he
is moderate.

BACK TO THE BARRICADES: ROCKER RETURNING TO SHEA 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Rocker will be in New York with the Braves again
for a three-game series starting Tuesday night, and the Mets will
use most of the same security measures that were in place when
Rocker visited Shea Stadium for the first time this season in June.
</P>
<P>
   More than 600 police officers were at Shea Stadium when Rocker,
who made inflammatory remarks about New York City, Mets fans,
foreigners and the No. 7 subway train, was here three months ago.
David Howard, the Mets' senior vice president for business and
legal affairs, would not say how many officers would be in
attendance this time, but it is believed there will be close to
500. There are 45 officers at a typical Mets game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will still be a significant police presence,'' Howard
said. ``We definitely get the sense that there seems to be less
focus on him in particular and more focus on where the team stands
in relation to the Braves.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard said the Mets had also restored the protection that they
had constructed near the visitor's bullpen in left field to protect
Rocker, who is the Braves' closer. There will be a tall fence
alongside the bleacher seats near the bullpen and a canopy over the
bullpen's bench and mounds. Howard noted that the extra police and
security details had been effective during Rocker's first visit.
More than 40,000 fans are expected for each of the Mets-Braves
games this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time there was a focus on him because it was the
first time he came to New York after his off-season comments,''
Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, officials with the Braves and the players association
said it was their understanding that Rocker would again refrain
from any attempt to ride the No. 7 train to Shea Stadium. &QL;

GOVERNMENT RULES `KENNEWICK MAN' SHOULD BE RETURNED TO TRIBES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID FISHER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Interior Department ruled Monday that the
9,000-year-old bones of ``Kennewick Man,'' one of the oldest
skeletons ever found in North America, should be returned to the
five modern American Indian tribes who claim him as an ancestor.
</P>
<P>
   But the ruling far from ends the 4-year-old conflict between the
Indians, the U.S. government and the scientists who want to study
the bones. And the decision may have only cleared the way to
intensify the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Kennewick Man _ a skull, 380 bones and fragments constituting a
nearly complete skeleton _ were found in the shallows of the
Columbia River in 1996 by a pair of college students.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists who studied the skeleton for the Interior Department
determined that some of its features bore a stronger resemblance to
the peoples of modern-day Polynesia or southern Asia, rather than
to the northern Asian features of modern American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   That could help call into question the currently accepted theory
that the continent's first immigrants arrived across a land bridge
from northern Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Most scientists have been barred from studying the bones,
though, while the government has tried to determine whether they
should be given to the local tribes for reburial under the 1990
Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt announced his decision Monday
in a letter to the Army Corps of Engineers, the agency currently
responsible for the remains, which are being stored at the
University of Washington's Burke Museum of Natural and Cultural
History in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although ambiguities in the data made this a close call, I was
persuaded by the geographic data and oral histories of the five
tribes that collectively assert they are the descendants of people
who have been in the region of the Upper Columbia Plateau for a
very long time,'' Babbitt wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Eight prominent anthropologists have sued the government for the
right to study the remains. They say that no reasonable cultural
link can be found between a modern tribe and bones estimated at
between 9,320 and 9,510 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was stayed while the Interior Department completed its
studies. Now that a decision has been rendered, the
anthropologists' attorney, Alan Schneider of Portland, Ore., said
he will immediately request that the stay be lifted so the lawsuit
can proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The Graves Protection and Repatriation Act applies to remains
housed in museums or found on federal lands, which constitute vast
portions of the American West. It states that human remains must be
returned to local tribes if a cultural affiliation to the tribes
can be established.
</P>
<P>
   If the Interior Department ruling stands, Schneider said it
could allow modern-day tribes to put nearly any human remains found
on federal lands off-limits to scientific study, regardless of age.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes, in many respects, are the future of archaeology in
North America,'' Schneider said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   A summary of the Interior Department's study, posted on its
Internet site, established few solid links between the world of
Kennewick Man and the modern tribes.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the Columbia Basin of 9,000 years ago
was a grassy, post-ice age savanna people by small, widely roving
groups of hunters who left few buildings, no evidence of extensive
food storage and only scant evidence of burial customs.
</P>
<P>
   The study found strong links between modern-day tribes and
people who inhabited the land 2,000 to 3,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But between 3,000 and 9,000 years ago, the area was
intermittently racked by huge floods, long dry periods and volcanic
eruptions, including the catastrophic explosion 7,600 years ago
that formed Crater Lake.
</P>
<P>
   It's not known whether the tribes of Kennewick Man's era
weathered those changes, or were replaced by outside bands.
</P>
<P>
   Pieces of the skeleton were sent to three laboratories, but they
were unable to extract DNA for analysis because of Kennewick Man's
age and mineralization.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is just so much that can happen over that space of
time,'' Schneider said. ``We are talking somewhere in the
neighborhood of 440 generations.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups that have claimed Kennewick Man, which include the
Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, the Colville
Confederated Tribes, the Wanapum Band, the Yakama Nation and the
Nez Perce Tribe, have an entirely different perspective on what's
important, Yakama Nation Tribal Council vice chairman Jerry
Meninick said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yakamas believe that, regardless of who or what placed
Kennewick Man in the Columbia Park riverbank where he was found, he
was placed there by the natural world, and he is now on a spiritual
journey.
</P>
<P>
   Disturbing his bones will disturb his journey, and that's enough
of a connection between past and present to justify his
repatriation to the native peoples who currently inhabit the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are of the thought that there is nothing we can do to
change the mind of Mother Nature,'' Meninick said. ``If it wants to
rain, or wants to snow, or wants to be spring and let the flowers
out, there is no law that we can change that can rearrange that.
And these remains are part of that nature now.''

MORE COMPANIES OFFERING SAME-SEX-PARTNER BENEFITS  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More companies are offering health insurance
benefits to partners of gay and lesbian employees than ever before,
including more than 100 of the Fortune 500 companies, a new study
has found.
</P>
<P>
   As of August, 3,572 companies, colleges, universities, states
and local governments were offering or had announced that they
would offer health insurance coverage to domestic partners of their
employees _ an increase of 25 percent from last year, the study
found. In August 1999, 2,856 of these companies, educational
institutions and governments offered such benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five percent of those in the survey provide domestic
partner benefits to same-sex and opposite-sex couples; 35 percent
offer benefits only to same-sex couples, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted by Human Rights Campaign, a
Washington-based group that represents gay, lesbian and transgender
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers have discovered that these benefits help attract and
keep the best workers, a critical consideration in the current
tight job market,'' said Kim I. Mills, education director for the
Human Rights Campaign and an editor of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Among Fortune 500 companies, the number of employers offering
benefits to domestic partners increased 46 percent, the study
found, to 102 this year from 70 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Three automakers _ DaimlerChrysler, General Motors and
Ford _ announced in June that they would offer health benefits to
the same-sex partners of their 466,000 hourly and salaried
employees in the United States. This was a ``landmark move'' in the
effort by corporate America to provide such benefits for gay and
lesbian couples, the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola also announced in June that it would extend health
coverage to domestic partners, joining General Mills and Pillsbury,
two other leading food producers that offer these benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing decided last October that it would offer health coverage
to nonunion members and their partners. Honeywell, another leading
aerospace company, provides benefits to domestic partners.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, the two largest American companies offering
same-sex benefits had been IBM and Citigroup, Mills said. Both
companies are based in the New York area, where gays and lesbians
are more politically and economically influential than they are in
the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a cultural shift taking place,'' Mills said. ``People
want to be open about their lives in the workplace. The public
attitude is that this kind of discrimination is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, President Clinton issued an executive order
prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation in the
federal civilian work force. To date, all cabinet-level departments
and 24 independent agencies have adopted nondiscrimination policies
with regard to sexual orientation. But the federal government does
not provide same-sex benefits for its employees.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety state and local governments or government agencies,
however, provide domestic partner health benefits, the report
showed. Since August 1999, Connecticut and Washington have added
benefits for state workers, joining California, New York, Vermont
and Oregon. In addition, 12 cities and counties have added or
announced that they would begin to offer these benefits, including
Atlanta, Phoenix, Montgomery County, Md., and Albuquerque, N.M.

NEW YORK CITY SCHOOL BOARD PIONEERING USE OF OUTSIDE ADVISERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a concession to the complexity of running a
21st-century school board, the New York City Board of Education is
planning to add outside experts from the corporate world,
government and community organizations to its committees that deal
with everything from finance to education policy.
</P>
<P>
   Although the board has previously asked outside experts to serve
on temporary task forces, this will be the first time the board has
used outsiders on its permanent committees. Education policy
experts say the board's plan is one of the first such moves by a
school board in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan comes as school boards around the country are being
called on to deal with issues that range far beyond education
policy, including details of employment law, computer networks and
financial management. Increasingly, education experts say, school
boards are not up to the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``School systems, and life in general, have become more
complex,'' said Carol A. Gresser, a former president of the board.
``They are no longer places where kids go just to learn to read and
write. They've become a one-stop shop where parents drop kids off
and ask the school to raise them. Schools offer dental care,
distribute condoms'' and offer a variety of other programs that
school board members are not qualified, by themselves, to oversee,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The outsiders, who will be appointed as committee advisers by
board members who are not themselves members of a given committee,
will have no voting rights. They may be affiliated with the public,
private or nonprofit sectors, and they will be reviewed for
potential conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   William C. Thompson Jr., president of the board, who outlined
the new policy in a memorandum to board members on Sept. 15, said
in an interview that the change was intended to ``make us
smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to bring in people who have these areas of expertise
to highlight the critical issues and make people aware of
everything that is going on in a field,'' Thompson said. That might
include budget and financial experts from corporations or
government agencies to help the audit and finance committees, or
parents and community organizations to help committees that focus
on English language learners or parent involvement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocacy groups, however, expressed initial skepticism
about the plan. Ruth Cohen, president of Pencil, an organization
that works to increase corporate involvement in the New York City
schools, warned that unless the new committees had clear goals, the
outsiders' time could easily be wasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume the committees will be structured in a way that
addresses the most urgent issues first,'' Cohen said. ``They had
better be careful about just putting another layer of bureaucracy
on an organization that has not exhibited any special kind of
talent in managing groups of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said that the notion of adding outsiders to board
committees grew out of the board's recent experiences, most notably
with the task force on teaching and learning in cyberspace. Earlier
this year, that group recommended building a new education Web site
for students and teachers to use in the classroom and at home,
distributing portable computers to children in the 4th through 12th
grades to enable them to use the site, and paying for the
enterprise through a separate commercial Web site that included
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The cyberspace task force included representatives from several
technology companies, including IBM, Toshiba and Cisco Systems;
technology experts from the United Federation of Teachers and the
Board of Education; academicians; and financial consultants.
</P>
<P>
   The task force was disbanded soon after making its
recommendations, in part to avoid conflicts of interest, board
officials said. Some of the companies represented on the task force
are interested in selling products or services to the Board of
Education for whatever technology program is eventually adopted.
</P>
<P>
   To streamline the board's committee structure, Thompson has
winnowed the number of standing committees to six _ technology,
education policy and program development, English language learners
and special education, finance, audit, and parent outreach and
involvement _ and appointed two board members, one as chairman, to
each committee.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, three board members were assigned to each of as many
as a dozen committees; some of those groups had been all but
dormant for years, board officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Board members were asked to submit recommendations for advisory
appointments to Thompson by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Simmons, the director of the Annenberg Institute for
School Reform at Brown University, said that school boards
typically rely on experts on a district's staff for advice on
technical issues, which presents an inherent conflict of interest
between the board and the people it is supposed to oversee.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, task forces that include outside experts are helpful
for bringing in new ideas to a school system, but their limited
life span denies the school board any ongoing expertise on an issue
after the task force issues its recommendations, Simmons said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a move in a good direction to bring in
independent experts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gresser, the director of the Institute for School Board
Leadership at Teachers College at Columbia University, said the new
policy could be effective ``as long as they don't just round up the
usual suspects'' of academic experts and policy advocates who have
advised the board for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mission of any school board is to get out into the
community and talk to the community-based organizations, the
neighborhood leaders and business people,'' Gresser said. But
school boards generally have forgotten that mission, getting too
caught up in local politics and micromanagement of the district
superintendent, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to screening advisory panel members for potential
conflicts of interest, Thompson said in his memo to the board that
advisers would not participate in all committee activities. ``There
may be an an occasion when the committee is discussing confidential
information and advisory members may be asked not to join a
specific meeting,'' he said.

NEW OWNER TAKES GUY'S OUT OF HOT OIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN MARGOLIES  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a hot Thursday morning recently, amid the din of massive
potato fryers and clanking conveyor belts, George Fulghum Jr.,
Guy's Foods' director of manufacturing, loudly reeled off some fast
food facts. On any given day, the Guy's plant:
</P>
<P>
   - Receives nine to 11 truckloads of potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   - Ships 17,000 cases of potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   - Processes 50,000 pounds of corn.
</P>
<P>
   - Uses 45,000 pounds of oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers just love us,'' he said as he picked up a potato and
checked it for blemishes.
</P>
<P>
   Things are looking up these days at Guy's Foods, the snack maker
founded 62 years ago by Guy Caldwell. The company, after descending
into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in February, has emerged with new
ownership, new management, an overhauled manufacturing and
distribution operation, and _ remarkably, given its recent
financial straits _ solid monthly earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was querying some of my academic colleagues to find some
precedents for what we're trying to do,'' said Guy's Foods
President Ron Hirasawa, who took over in April after buying the
company's assets out of bankruptcy. ``And there aren't any. Because
what we've done is essentially take the company out of bankruptcy,
done a turnaround with it and then merged it with another
company.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the talk these days of the new economy, it's sometimes
easy to forget that the economy isn't driven strictly by bytes but
also by products that you can, well, bite _ potato chips, for
instance, or pretzels, corn chips or cheese curls.
</P>
<P>
   Those are among the 1,500 items made by Guy's at its massive
325,000-square-foot manufacturing and distribution complex,
Liberty's fourth-largest employer with 600 workers.
</P>
<P>
   In just six months, Hirasawa, 56, has reorganized Guy's from top
to bottom, stanching the flow of red ink that threatened to put the
company out of business for good. He has restructured every
department, reduced payroll, upgraded the plant's machinery,
revamped an archaic distribution system and reorganized much of the
plant's work flow.
</P>
<P>
   The results _ more than $15 million in annual cost savings and
the restoration of Guy's to monthly profitability _ have surprised
even Hirasawa, a graduate of the Wharton School of Business with 20
years' experience in the food industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should be able to make it because they still have a
strong following in Kansas City and they nibble in St. Louis a
little bit,'' said Bernard Pacyniak, editor of Snack Food &AMP;
Wholesale Bakery, an industry publication. ``If you can get the No.
1 or No. 2 position in your market, you can make a go of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The highly competitive world of salty snacks is dominated by a
handful of giants, most notably Pepsico subsidiary Frito-Lay, which
accounts for nearly two-thirds of total potato chip production and
reaps $1.2 billion from that category alone. Guy's, by contrast,
had $12.2 million in potato chip sales last year, a minuscule 0.5
percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for years regional players like Guy's were able to hold
their own by catering to local tastes, cultivating strong
partnerships with retailers and developing strong regional brand
identities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall Guy's being a pretty reputable company that made
good-quality products,'' said Don Petty, an industry consultant in
the Dallas area. ``... If you have a quality chip and sell it at a
competitive price, you can still get some of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   But Guy's seemed to lose its way after dairy giant Borden Inc.
bought it in 1979. The 50 percent share of the local market held by
Guy's plummeted to around 13 percent by the early 1980s, and Guy's
never quite recovered its local edge.
</P>
<P>
   Borden eventually got out of the snack food business and sold
the company in 1994 to a group of Guy's executives led by Victor
Sabatino, who became its president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   The buyout, however, left Guy's with a heavy debt load. And its
ill-advised purchase in 1998 of a snack maker in North Carolina put
additional strain on the company's finances. Plans to expand
production and distribution on the East Coast floundered, and the
North Carolina operation filed for bankruptcy in September 1999,
five months before its parent company.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Guy's sought refuge in bankruptcy court, it was
losing $600,000 a month, according to court filings. That came atop
losses of more than $3 million in fiscal 1999 and projected monthly
losses of $1 million in the aftermath of the bankruptcy filing.
</P>
<P>
   The company appeared all but doomed. Three days before seeking
Chapter 11 protection, Guy's closed its plant and halted retail
deliveries. The shutdown threatened Guy's with the loss of valuable
retail shelf space and its hard-won customer base.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Hirasawa stepped in. Hirasawa, owner of Fort Wayne,
Ind.-based General Products and Services Corp., offered to assume
$14.3 million in Guy's debt and other expenses in exchange for the
company's assets. After some other would-be bids fell through, U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Frank Koger approved the offer and the deal closed
on March 28.
</P>
<P>
   Hirasawa is no stranger to Kansas City. Thirty years ago he
worked in sales and brand management at Folger Coffee's downtown
plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had fond memories of this place,'' he said in a recent
interview at the Guy's facility.
</P>
<P>
   Hirasawa's career after Folger took him through a succession of
jobs: a product manager at Johnson Wax in Racine, Wis.;
new-products director at Morrell Meat Co. in Chicago; an account
executive at the Leo Burnett advertising agency in Chicago; and an
independent food consultant.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, while working as a consultant, he decided to start his
own food company, Ultima Foods. Hirasawa, the grandson of Japanese
immigrants, grew up in Washington state, where his parents raised
row crops. There he came to appreciate the allure of spicy foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always loved the Tex-Mex food that the migrant workers on
the farm made,'' Hirasawa said. ``I used to make salsa for friends
and everyone loved it. So I decided to go commercial with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The tiny Ultima operation initially contracted with a center for
mentally retarded adults to produce its first products, salsa and
pepper jelly, which were distributed mainly in the Chicago area.
When sales reached seven figures, Hirasawa began looking for a
plant to buy.
</P>
<P>
   He found it in Fort Wayne, where a salty snack maker called
Seyfert's Foods operated a 145,000-square-foot plant built in 1964.
Seyfert's, which was founded in 1934 and also was once owned by
Borden, had about $40 million in annual sales but was losing money.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by a group of private investors, Hirasawa purchased
Seyfert's in February 1999, merged it with Ultima and renamed the
company General Products and Services Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized there was a bigger opportunity in the Midwest for
consolidation and integrating different salty snack companies,''
Hirasawa said. ``So we did the merger with Seyfert's, which was 30
times larger (than Ultima). They badly needed marketing, sales and
new-product development help. And we badly needed a plant.''
</P>
<P>
   About a year later, Guy's was looking for a buyer. By then, its
only hope of survival rested on an infusion of new capital.
Seyfert's, meanwhile, continued to rack up losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had lost so much money that we needed to do another deal to
get economies of scale,'' Hirasawa said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides assuming Guy's Foods' debts, including more than $11
million owed to LaSalle National Bank of Chicago, Hirasawa brought
$5 million in private capital to the table, most of it from the
group that backed his Seyfert's bid. LaSalle agreed to assume
Seyfert's indebtedness to another bank, bringing the total purchase
package to about $27 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hirasawa acted quickly to get Guy's back on its feet. The
combined payroll of Guy's, Seyfert's and Ultima, which were merged,
was reduced from 1,400 to 900. (Many Guy's workers who quit pre-
and post-bankruptcy weren't replaced.) Those let go included
Sabatino and about 40 other middle and top managers.
</P>
<P>
   Hirasawa then inked a new collective bargaining agreement with
United Food and Commercial Workers Local 211, which represents
Guy's hourly workers, route salesmen and transport drivers. The
agreement called for the same wages as the company's pre-bankruptcy
agreement but changed the noneconomic terms to match those in Fort
Wayne, which was also a union shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to tell you that, overall, our experience with the new
ownership has been extremely positive,'' said lawyer John Lilla,
who represents the local. ``Their attitude in negotiations was
pretty much `You need an agreement and we need an agreement, so how
do we get one?' It was never take it or leave it, which is what we
were used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Lilla said the union has had ``virtually no grievances'' under
the new regime ``because whenever a problem comes up, they sit down
and talk about it. It's really been a different world.''
</P>
<P>
   One sign of the changing times at Guy's: The company has
converted a small building that once housed its credit union into a
licensed day-care center. The center accommodates both
manufacturing shifts, opening at 5:30 a.m. and running as late as
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a powerful drawing card for skilled workers,'' Hirasawa
said.
</P>
<P>
   Having taken care of labor relations, Hirasawa then turned to
the company's distribution system, a major source of overhead. He
slashed the number of delivery routes from 330 to 230 and got rid
of 123 garage-type storage bins spread out over six states,
replacing them with a dozen large distribution centers. That cut
nearly $1 million in direct, leasing and insurance costs.
</P>
<P>
   In the warehouse, Hirasawa eliminated the practice of loading
trucks by hand, which allowed 20 percent more product to be placed
on the trucks but also took two hours or more to do and led to
frequent product breakage. Products instead were pallet-loaded, a
process that takes 20 to 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before you had 20 different items on these trucks that were
stopping at hundreds of bin locations. But they couldn't deliver
because it was all crammed into 48-foot-long trailers,'' Hirasawa
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the route drivers come in with their panel trucks and pull
off exactly what they need from the distribution centers. It's more
efficient and the amount of your damage and stale (products) goes
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirasawa also salvaged millions of dollars in equipment from the
Fort Wayne plant, which he shut down after the Guy's purchase. A
1,200-pound-per hour pretzel machine, a 15-ton monster, was moved
to Liberty, as were 13 packaging machines.
</P>
<P>
   Hirasawa has now turned his attention to strategic
considerations: boosting sales and growing the market.
</P>
<P>
   How does he propose to compete in an industry dominated by a few
giants?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he said, by building on and expanding
relationships with such retailers as Wal-Mart, ``where we can
customize by market and provide a higher level of services.''
</P>
<P>
   For another, by developing niche products, such as the blue corn
chips made by Ultima, for the specialty and health food markets.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, by giving employees at Guy's reason to think that
their futures are secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a breath of fresh air,'' said Fulghum, the director
of manufacturing. ``Things are definitely a lot different now.''

A N.Y. HOSPITAL MOURNS 4 NURSES KILLED IN VIRGINIA BEACH MISHAP 
</HEADLINE>
   By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Friends since nursing school, the four women had
worked a combined 158 years at St. Vincents Hospital in Manhattan,
caring for ill children. They loved traveling almost as much as
they loved their work, and that common passion sent them on trips
around the world together.
</P>
<P>
   That bond offered some comfort to their colleagues Monday as
they mourned the deaths of the women, pediatric nurses who died
together Sunday afternoon in Virginia Beach, Va., when their car
smashed through a parking garage wall and fell 41 feet onto a busy
beachfront entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The crash killed Mary Ann Dono, 60, of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn; Mary
Ann Going, 60, of East Elmhurst, Queens; Kathleen Mollick-Kelly,
63, of the Upper West Side of Manhattan; and Joan Ellen Walsh, 56,
of Flatlands, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wanted to get one of them, all you had to do was call
one of the others,'' said Dr. Anthony Gagliardi, the medical
director of St. Vincents Hospital and Medical Center, who had known
the women for more than 20 years. ``They were almost inseparable, a
true family. They made care at this institution not just clinically
proper but humanistically proper.''
</P>
<P>
   Police in Virginia Beach, where the women were vacationing,
remained puzzled Monday as to what caused the women's 1999 Honda
Accord to plow through a 3-foot-high concrete wall and crash to the
ground from the top floor of the five-story parking garage. A
police spokesman said a preliminary investigation showed no signs
of mechanical problems with the car or alcohol use by the driver,
Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``They worked together, they traveled together,'' said Barbara
Rogus, a neighbor of Walsh's in Brooklyn. ``So God took them
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Dono, who was known around the hospital as the ``walking
pediatrics encyclopedia,'' managed the pediatric and neonatal
intensive care unit and had worked at St. Vincents since 1960,
officials said. Going, who joined the staff a year later, was the
unit's nursing care coordinator and staff education instructor.
Walsh began work at the hospital in 1964 and was the pediatric case
manager. Mollick-Kelly, the only one of the women to ever marry,
was the head nurse of the hospital's pediatric and
obstetrics/gynecology outpatient clinic. She was divorced and had
worked at the hospital since 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Dono, who was a eucharistic minister at St. Patrick's Church in
Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, had been an instructor at St. Vincents'
nursing school, which closed in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In between consoling one another, colleagues spent the day
reminiscing and marveling at how the women had dedicated their
lives to caring for children but never had any of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were totally, totally dedicated to children and
nursing,'' said Sister Miriam Kevin Phillips, the former nursing
school director, who knew the women for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   As St. Vincents began to grapple with the loss, the police in
Virginia Beach continued to try to piece together the details of
the accident. Witnesses who saw the car before it fell shortly
after 12:30 p.m. Sunday told the police they saw it drive into the
garage then plunge from the rooftop level. The garage is next to
the Sandcastle Oceanfront Motel, where the women were staying.
</P>
<P>
   ``In almost 30 years of policing, this is one of the most
bizarre accidents I've ever seen,'' said Don Rimer, a spokesman for
the Virginia Beach Police. ``The car drove up the ramp, made a
turn, then went through the wall. There is no evidence that the
brakes were applied and no evidence that excessive speed or alcohol
were involved. We don't know what caused this one.''
</P>
<P>
   The motel's general manager, Varshid Vachhani, said: ``The
management and the staff are deeply shocked. It's something that we
can't imagine happening in our wildest nightmares.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people had been milling about the area for an
end-of-summer festival at the time of the crash. ``The true miracle
is that no one on the ground was hit,'' said Rimer, the police
spokesman.

DEFENSE IN BOMBING TRIAL ALLEGES COERCION OF WITNESSES 
</HEADLINE>
   By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lawyers for a suspect in a terrorism case involving
the bombing of two U.S. embassies have accused federal prosecutors
of employing a ``pattern of coercion and intimidation'' against at
least eight potential defense witnesses through improper use of the
grand jury and other tactics.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute, now being played out in secret in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan, has led the defense lawyers to ask that a
federal judge quash grand jury subpoenas issued to four witnesses
who were friends or former business associates of the defendant,
Wadih El-Hage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only relief that can ensure that Mr. El-Hage receives a
fair trial is simply to halt the government's abuse of the grand
jury,'' the lawyers wrote on Sept. 13 in a letter sent to a federal
judge, Barrington D. Parker Jr., who supervised the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said the effort to intimidate some witnesses was
likely to be particularly effective, considering their ``membership
in a vulnerable minority community'' _ that of Muslim Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute comes just three months before El-Hage and five
co-defendants are to stand trial on allegations that they were part
of a terrorist conspiracy led by Osama bin Laden. The government
said the conspiracy was behind the bombings of embassies in
Tanzania and Kenya in August 1998. More than 200 people died in the
bombings, while thousands more were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times was given a copy of the defense lawyers'
10-page letter by someone who is not a lawyer in the trial, but who
knows one of the subpoenaed witnesses and said the matter should be
publicized.
</P>
<P>
   El-Hage's lawyers, Sam A. Schmidt and Joshua L. Dratel, said
Monday night that ``the letter speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney for the
Southern District of New York, refused to comment. It could not be
determined whether White's office had responded to the letter.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony of all four subpoenaed witnesses, the lawyers
wrote, would aid El-Hage's defense. But the lawyers also wrote that
all four ``have been threatened, pressured and warned that the
government believes they are lying'' because they differed with the
government's view of El-Hage's role.
</P>
<P>
   ``By abusing the grand jury and its subpoena power,'' the letter
said, the government will ``haul each of the four before the grand
jury, admonish each about the penalties for perjury _ with each
witness knowing the consequences of testimony that deviates from
the government's version of events.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers asserted that the tactics had already deprived
El-Hage of the testimony of another potential witness, Moataz
Al-Hallak, a friend of El-Hage and the former imam of the Islamic
Society of Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   Al-Hallak refused to talk with the defense team, the lawyers
wrote, ``a recalcitrance that is most likely due to fear of
reprisals by the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Hallak's lawyer, Stanley L. Cohen, confirmed on Monday that
his client, who had testified three times before the grand jury,
refused to speak with El-Hage's lawyers more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said Al-Hallak ``felt endangered and subject to further
government harassment if he cooperated'' with El-Hage.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution has accused Al-Hallak in court, but never
charged him, with serving ``as a contact between members of the bin
Laden organization,'' an allegation he has denied.
</P>
<P>
   El-Hage's lawyers cited other examples of ``heavy-handed
coercive tactics'' by the government. For example, they wrote,
Khadar Ibrahim, a former business associate of El-Hage in Texas,
was arrested and charged last April with illegally harboring his
own brother, who had an asylum petition pending with the U.S.
government. Ibrahim has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said Ibrahim was told that ``his wife and other
family members were in jeopardy of being arrested, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Removing any doubt that the arrest was effected as a means of
influencing Ibrahim in connection with his possible testimony in
this case,'' El-Hage's lawyers wrote, he ``was visited only days
later by the assistant United States attorney in charge of this
case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``During that meeting,'' they wrote, `` Ibrahim was offered
assistance in his own case in return for cooperation with the
government against El-Hage.''
</P>
<P>
   Another witness, Khalil Zaidan, was arrested by federal agents
earlier this year in Oregon, the lawyers wrote. Zaidan was accused
of mislabeling the speed of computers he was selling, a charge he
has denied.
</P>
<P>
   As in Ibrahim's case, the government offered assistance in
return for the witness' cooperation in their investigation of
El-Hage, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Such tactics were also having a chilling effect on witnesses
overseas, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   In advance of a trip to Germany this year to interview a former
business associate of El-Hage's, the lawyers said, they had filed a
travel voucher seeking court approval for the trip. But before they
arrived, the man was interrogated by German law enforcement
authorities about his dealings with El-Hage, and was fired by his
employer.
</P>
<P>
   Two other potential defense witnesses in the Republic of
Slovakia were visited and questioned about El-Hage by local law
enforcement officials at about the same time his lawyers traveled
there to interview them, the letter said.

JUDGE DISMISSES STATE SUIT OVER POLLUTION OF HUDSON 
</HEADLINE>
   By KIRK JOHNSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lawsuit filed by New York state's attorney general, Eliot L.
Spitzer, against General Electric last year arguing that the
company should be held liable for the economic costs of pollution
in the Hudson River has been dismissed by an Albany judge, who
called it ``premature'' and ``meritless.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer refused to admit defeat, however, and said the lawsuit's
central argument would be revived in another suit.
</P>
<P>
   The case marked what legal authorities said was a novel approach
in the decades-long drama of the Hudson's contamination and the
tortuous path to its cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of focusing on environmental or health damage from the
polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, that General Electric factories
discharged into the river during three decades, Spitzer asked to
court to look at the harm to navigation, tourism and the economic
life of the river.
</P>
<P>
   The suit contended that shipping and tourism traffic on the
35-mile-long Champlain Canal, which stretches from the southern tip
of Lake Champlain to a point just down river from two General
Electric factories, has become severely restricted because
contaminated silt has built up in the river.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office asked the judge to order that
section of the river dredged, and to make the company pay for the
damage to the local economy because larger boats can no longer make
the canal journey. The state has not dredged the silt that blocks
the vessels' way because the need to prevent the PCB's from
spreading would make it too costly, officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision, which he signed on Sept. 14 but apparently only
issued to the parties Monday, Justice Stephen A. Ferradino of State
Supreme Court said, in effect, that the court was being asked to go
into uncharted territory. Since the agencies with regulatory
control over the dredging issue, especially the Environmental
Protection Agency, have not rendered a decision on whether dredging
is the best solution to the PCB problem, the judge said, the court
could take no action on its own.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric has spent tens of millions of dollars asserting
that the PCBs should be left entombed in the river bottom silt, and
that dredging could repollute a river that the company officials
say is cleansing itself. Justice Ferradino stressed that even if
the company wanted to dredge the river, it could not legally do so
now, nor could he order it to.
</P>
<P>
   ``G.E. would be under court order to do what it could not do,''
he wrote. ``The court will not put the defendant in such an
untenable position.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said he believed an equally important element of the
decision was the judge's ruling that the statute of limitations
governing legal claims over the PCB pollution had not expired, as
General Electric's lawyers contended.
</P>
<P>
   The company's plants discharged into the river, legally and
under state permit, about one million pounds of PCBs from the 1940s
to the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists mostly agreed with Spitzer that the decision
left room for future maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge left the door open for the attorney general to come
back at this issue once the EPA has rendered its decision,'' said
Cara Lee, the environmental director of Scenic Hudson, a private
conservation group in Poughkeepsie.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for G.E., Mark L. Behan, characterized the ruling as
dismissing Spitzer's overall argument about the canal. The statute
of limitations finding would do nothing to bolster any future
lawsuits, Behan argued.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA has said it will issue a final decision on a cleanup
plan by the end of this year.

EDITORIAL: REPUDIATING MILOSEVIC  
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Sept. 26: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During his decade in power, Slobodan Milosevic has lost piece
after piece of his country. His Serbian nationalism and demagoguery
ended in the independence of Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia, their
borders drawn in blood. Today Macedonia is independent, Kosovo is
under United Nations control and Serbia's sister republic,
Montenegro, has seceded in all but name. Milosevic is left with
only Serbia, and after Sunday's elections, Serbia is no longer his.
</P>
<P>
   While the government is still insisting that its partial count
gives Milosevic 45 percent to Vojislav Kostunica's 40 percent, the
more credible vote count carried out by opposition election
monitors shows an overwhelming opposition victory, despite
widespread reports of government vote-rigging. Kostunica, according
to this tally, has 55 percent, 21 points more than Milosevic and
enough to avoid a second round of balloting. The European Union,
Germany, Britain, France and Italy all urged Milosevic to accept
defeat, while the United States said on Monday that it appeared he
would lose.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kostunica expected to come out ahead, the opposition
did not expect the large margin of victory, or its success in
municipal elections. Turnout was high, with nearly 70 percent of
registered voters casting ballots. Several of Milosevic's powerful
allies have defected from his side. Government officials, who
seemed to have made the mistake of swallowing their own propaganda,
seemed stunned. Word of the defeat is seeping through the army and
security forces, which may make them less likely to enforce a
fraudulent result. Whether or not he acknowledges defeat, this
election is surely the beginning of Milosevic's demise.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Yugoslav authorities have been stalling, announcing no
official results. It appears likely that the government will stick
with the claim that a runoff in two weeks is necessary. By that
time, presumably, Milosevic will have his fraud better organized,
and he might even make one last try at rallying nationalist
sentiment by attacking Montenegro or staging an act of violence he
can attribute to his enemies. As a backup, Milosevic's aides are
maintaining that even if he has lost this election, he is entitled
to stay as Yugoslavia's president until his term ends in June 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition should be wary of a runoff. Its leaders plan to
hold a new round of rallies Tuesday night in various cities. After
Milosevic lost local elections in 1996, three months of large
street demonstrations forced him to acknowledge those defeats.
Although in the last few years the opposition has drawn sparse
crowds, its energy and electoral victory should prove a bigger
attraction now.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica should reject deals that allow Milosevic to retain
power behind the scenes. Even if Milosevic decides to accept
defeat, he will negotiate every step that trims his power.
Kostunica should not start by making concessions. It would only
undercut his goal of making Serbia a modern and democratic nation.

ROMANIAN GYMNAST TESTS POSITIVE AND LOSES GOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Less than a week after the charismatic
Romanian Andreea Raducan won the prestigious Olympic all-around
gold with a style some compared to Nadia Comaneci, she was stripped
of her medal Tuesday after testing positive for a banned drug.
</P>
<P>
   A Romanian team doctor administered the drug stimulant
pseudoephedrine to the diminutive 16-year-old Raducan in the form
of a cold medicine. Dr. Ioachin Oana was held responsible and was
expelled from the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Raducan is the first gymnast to be stripped of her medal because
of a drug violation. She is the second athlete at these Games to
lose a gold and is the sixth positive drug case at the Sydney
Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``A team physician should be able to read a bloody label on a
package,'' said Dick Pound, vice president of the International
Olympic Committee and head of the world anti-doping program. ``It
was reckless on the part of the physician. His athlete tested
positive; and because of it, her medal was withdrawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Raducan was allowed to keep the gold she won as a part of the
team competition and also the silver medal she took in the vault.
But with Raducan's disqualification, the Romanian sweep of the
all-around medals came to an end. Romanian Simona Amanar claims the
gold in the individual all-around competition, and her teammate,
Maria Olaru, moves up from bronze to silver. Liu Xuan of China, who
placed fourth, is the bronze medalist.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement issued Tuesday by the IOC's executive
board, the presence of the banned substance was detected in the A
urine sample. The Romanian delegation was informed of the results
on Monday, and they requested a B sample be tested. The results
were the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this case is completely irrelevant,'' Ion Tiriac,
the president of the Romanian National Olympic Committee, told the
Associated Press. ``The athlete is the best gymnast in the world at
this time _ she has proved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Raducan was part of a mighty Romanian gymnastics team. On
Thursday night, she stood atop her coaches shoulders and smiled
brightly after her dominating performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of them,'' said Bela Karolyi, the U.S. team
coordinator, who laid the groundwork for the Romanian program. ``I
feel good about what has happened to their program.''
</P>
<P>
   Raducan has been the sparkling ornament on the Romanian program.
Steadily, she has risen through the factory-like system in Romania
and had become one of the elite gymnasts. On Thursday, she also
proved adaptable to even the most bizarre circumstances. When the
vault was mismeasured two inches too low during the first two
rotations of the all-around competition, Raducan was one of the few
who did not allow the error to disrupt her form or technique.
Effortlessly, she stuck her vault with a score of 9.7.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the long-limbed Russian Svetlana Khorkina _ who was one
of the favorites for the gold, but saw that chance ruined by the
error in the vault _ Raducan revealed herself to be the template
for the gymnastic pixie. At 4 feet 10 inches tall, and just 82
pounds, she is the perfect size to impress the judges. She is also
better equipped to adjust on the fly. But now, after a team
physician administered a cold medicine with the banned drug,
Raducan, who was the first Romanian to win the gold in the
all-around since Comaneci, has been stripped of her glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless the physician is a moron, he should know what he is
giving an athlete,'' Pound said. ``If there is a presence of a
banned drug, he should be able to realize that.''
</P>
<P>
   Raducan is the fourth athlete to be stripped of a medal because
of drugs. Three Bulgarian weightlifters lost their medals,
including Izabela Dragneva, the gold medalist in the women's
105-pound event.
</P>
<P>
   Sevdalin Minchev lost his bronze in the men's 137-pound class,
and Ivan Ivanov lost his silver medal in the 123-pound class.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, two other non-medalists, a hammer thrower from
Belarus and a rower from Latvia, have been expelled for positive
drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first drug controversy for the Romanian team in
Sydney. Two weightlifters were expelled for failing pre-game,
out-of-competition tests. The entire weightlifting team faced being
kicked out, but paid a $50,000 fine to allow the ``clean''
weightlifters to stay.

OCEANSIDE RECEIVER SAYS IT'LL BE USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC has received an oral commitment from wide
receiver William Buchanon of Oceanside High School.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanon, 6-foot-3, 180 pounds, is one of the top four receivers
listed on PrepStar magazine's Dream Team of the nation's top
players. He caught 24 passes for 553 yards and five touchdowns last
season.
</P>
<P>
   He is the son of former Green Bay Packers and San Diego Chargers
football player Willie Buchanon.
</P>
<P>
   Including Buchanon, USC now has commitments from six players.
The others are quarterbacks Matt Leinart of Mater Dei and Billy
Hart of Mission Viejo, tailback David Kirtman of Mercer Island,
Wash., defensive tackle Jason Wardlow of Upland and defensive back
John Walker of Birmingham High.
</P>
<P>
   __ Not-so special teams: After having a punt blocked and missing
two extra points against San Jose State, USC coach Paul Hackett
said he will begin placing more emphasis on the kicking game this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not one thing, it's a number of things we need to work
on,'' Hackett said. ``We certainly will (stress it) now. I don't
feel we're way off but we need to clean it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said a bad snap caused the first of the two missed extra
points and that kicker David Newbury was responsible for the second
miscue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I hit it good but it hit the upright,'' said
Newbury.
</P>
<P>
   USC will continue to use freshman Norm Katnik as the snapper on
punts, after he made his debut last week. The Trojans want to rest
starting linebacker Zeke Moreno, who has been the punt snapper.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be the snapper. We're real raggedy right now,''
Hackett said. ``The problem is Lonnie Ford is out and Zeke is
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who has a sprained ankle, is expected to return this week
against Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   __ Still confident: The oh-so-close victory over San Jose State
hasn't deterred the eighth-ranked Trojans from continuing to think
the Orange Bowl, site of the national-championship game, remains a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're undefeated, and only the undefeated teams will go to the
Orange Bowl,'' Moreno said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Change in philosophy: After some criticism that USC had not
run any pitch plays to tailback Sultan McCullough in its first two
games, Hackett was quick to point out that he called the play
against San Jose State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've taken a lot of flak for not pitching the ball and now
we're pitching the ball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Secondary situation: Although junior Chris Cash made his
first start, filling in for Kris Richard at left cornerback,
Hackett said Cash would return to the right side and again share
time with Darrell Rideaux.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's worked well,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard will continue to be backed up by sophomore Kevin Arbet.
</P>
<P>
   __ Arizona kickoff: USC's game against Arizona on Oct. 7 at the
Coliseum will start at 12:30 p.m. and be televised on Channel 7.
</P>
<P>
   __ Fast start: Entering the week, USC is 27-1 in football, water
polo, women's volleyball and women's soccer. The only team to lose
a game is women's soccer, while the water polo and volleyball teams
are ranked No. 1 in the nation.

EDITORIAL: A SOFT-MONEY TREATY 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Sept. 26: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rep. Rick Lazio both claim credit for
taking the initiative and agreeing mutually to ban soft-money
broadcast ads in their New York Senate campaigns. That is fine with
us. Each deserves praise for taking a step that, while limited,
could curb an egregious fund-raising abuse and sends a powerful
signal to other campaigns around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's challenge to Clinton to sign a soft-money treaty was a
centerpiece of his performance in their recent debate. He got mixed
reviews for presentation, but the effort was worthwhile. The first
lady showed independence and resolve in accepting an accord that
puts her at some political disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio-Clinton accord should not be seen as a substitute for
campaign reform legislation that would ban all raising and spending
of unlimited party donations from corporations, unions and rich
individuals, known as soft money. Under their accord, both
candidates will still allow parties and groups supporting them to
spend such money on telephone banks, mailings and get-out-the-vote
drives. Clinton has made it clear that she intends to raise such
money for the Democrats to spend on her own race and others, and it
would have been better if she had agreed to forgo such activities
altogether. But realistically, the ban on raising and spending soft
money for television and radio ads was a step in the right
direction.
</P>
<P>
   There have been occasional pacts in the past on limiting
fund-raising. The Senate race in 1996 between Sen. John F. Kerry of
Massachusetts and his challenger, Gov. William Weld, involved an
agreed-upon cap on spending, although some reports suggested that
it unraveled at the end. The New York agreement almost ran aground
over Clinton's demand that outside groups be barred from running
ads backing the Republican campaign while outside groups backing
her campaign could go ahead. She argued that while Republican
groups were sham organizations, the groups backing her were more
legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week Clinton dropped her demand, and it was replaced
by an accord on broadcast advertising that resembled a nuclear arms
agreement. By its terms, if any independent groups run ads
supporting one candidate, the other may authorize the running of
ads in some fashion that is proportionate. Each campaign will now
have to keep tabs on the other's activities, something they say
they can do through the agencies that place ads. Clinton has called
on the groups supporting her _ notably the AFL-CIO, the Sierra Club
and the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League _
to refrain from television and radio ads. They should do so as a
matter of civic-mindedness and loyalty to the candidate they
support.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers have already been bombarded by television ads in the
Senate race. The ads are likely to continue in some form, because
both sides will run them with ``hard money'' raised in chunks no
greater than $1,000 per individual and $5,000 per political action
committee. The soft-money accord may also lead to a profusion of
mailings and phone calls on behalf of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But the soft-money deal is important because once again it flies
in the face of the argument in Washington that no one really cares
about campaign finance reform. Of course if voters did not care,
Lazio and Clinton would not have done this deal. Once they adhere
to it, their example can pave the way for real reform enacted in
Washington.

FOR GOODEN AND CONE, STRUGGLES FROM THE START 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZ ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before the game against Detroit, Manager Joe Torre
called Dwight Gooden's four-month metamorphosis from down and
out-of-work pitcher pondering retirement to Yankees' fill-in
starter Monday night a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   But Gooden, a project twice reclaimed in pinstripes, hardly
looked like a pitcher who had solidified a postseason roster spot
once he took the mound at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Two towering home runs and two and two-thirds innings later, the
miracle had turned to a debacle, and things only darkened for the
Yankees, who were 15-4 losers in their last scheduled game of the
regular season at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Yankees failed to win, a loss by second-place Toronto
to Tampa Bay Monday night lowered to two the Yankees' number to
clinch the American League East title.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden had replaced his friend David Cone in the starting
rotation, making his first start since Aug. 1. By the time Cone,
having the worst season of his career, came in from the bullpen in
the fourth inning, the Tigers had a 5-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   They padded it with four runs before Cone left, leaving these
combined numbers for the two aging Cy Young Award winners: 9 runs,
11 hits, 5 walks, a wild pitch and 1 strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden (6-5) was charged with the loss, his first in five
starts. Cone just got more demoralized.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden was signed by the Yankees to a minor league contract on
June 11, after being released by Tampa Bay and Houston. He began
his second stint with the Yankees by winning in his return debut,
beating the Mets on his former grand stage of Shea Stadium on July
8. He did not lose in four starts.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden had also made 11 appearances from the bullpen, most
recently throwing four and a third scoreless innings in relief of
Cone against Toronto last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But on a cold, blustery night, this was not the revived Gooden.
His troubles began in the second inning, when Damion Easley teed
off on an 0-1 pitch with Hal Morris on base, the ball sailing just
over the left-field wall for a 2-1 Tigers lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, Gooden unraveled after he walked the
leadoff batter, Rich Becker. Bernie Williams made a spectacular
diving catch in right-center on a drive by Juan Encarnacion,
sprinting to his left and snagging the ball in the webbing of his
glove as he slid to the wet grass.
</P>
<P>
   But it only saved one run.
</P>
<P>
   Two pitches later, Bobby Higginson smacked an 1-0 fastball into
the empty in the upper deck in right to give the Tigers a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After getting Billy McMillon to pop up to Chuck Knoblauch at
second base, Gooden allowed a pair of singles and another run,
leading to an early exit.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Torre had said that Gooden had a ``new lease on
life.'' Gooden had not only assured himself a spot in the bullpen
for the post- season, but he also suddenly had control and a new
off-speed out-pitch. ``He's really been terrific, whether used out
of the bullpen or starting,'' Torre said. ``He's given us a chance
to win. He's kept you in there.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out Monday night was Gooden's shortest start as a
Yankee this year, and his shortest outing since May 8, when he went
two and a third innings with Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Dingman replaced Gooden and retired Easley on a pop to
third to end the third inning, but the pitching woes only worsened.
Torre had removed Cone from Monday night's scheduled start because
he said Cone's left shoulder, dislocated on Sept. 5, was still
inhibiting him for long outings. Cone trotted onto the field to a
rousing cheer in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   It was his first relief appearance since Oct. 4, 1992, when he
also faced the Tigers, in a Toronto uniform. That night he pitched
two scoreless innings. Monday night had none of the same symmetry.
ConeCone walked the first batter he faced, Robert Fick.
</P>
<P>
   Cone retired Becker on a fly to left, but Encarnacion's
subsequent fly ball to left was dropped by David Justice, who had
it in the pocket of his glove momentarily. It was ruled a hit and
Encarnacion reached second as ecker took third.
</P>
<P>
   Cone walked Higginson intentionally and then gave up a sacrifice
fly to Dean Palmer, making the score 5-1. It was 8-1 by the time
Cone walked off the mound at the end of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Cone gave up another run, with a wild pitch and a walk involved,
before Torre yanked him for Randy Choate with one out in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees got two runs back in the bottom of the inning, when
knuckleballer Steve Sparks walked Williams to lead off the fourth
and then gave up a two-run home run to Justice. It was Justice's
41st home run of the season, a career best, and his 20th since
joining the Yankees in late June.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks had lost three straight games going into Monday night and
he struggled early. Knoblauch opened the Yankee first with a single
up the middle and Derek Jeter followed with a single to left.
Williams' infield ground ball scored Knoblauch and gave the Yankees
a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It did not last an inning as Gooden and Cone, each hoping for a
long-term or even short-term redemption, fooled no one but their
manager.

NBC SHOWS IT HASN'T FORGOTTEN NEWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Live news broke late Sunday and NBC, even in tape delay, was
there to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   An eventually confirmed report about a positive drug test from
shot putter C.J. Hunter at a meet earlier this year made it onto
NBC's prime-time broadcast in timely fashion _ although three hours
later on the West Coast than East Coast viewers found out about it.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it sure looked and sounded live.
</P>
<P>
   After a local news update at 11 p.m., Bob Costas, who does his
segments live for the Eastern Time Zone, appeared to set up the
next event but instead reported the story, careful at first to
refer to it as report in an Australian paper.
</P>
<P>
   Track and field analyst Lewis Johnson also was in studio to give
the story some perspective, talking about how Hunter had claimed a
knee injury had kept him from that meet as well as these Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
   The story's possible affect on Hunter's wife, sprinter Marion
Jones, also was discussed.
</P>
<P>
   As the final hour of coverage progressed, NBC reporters
substantiated the story and eventually set up an interview with
Hunter at what Costas described as a ``neutral location.'' Although
Hunter eventually did not do the TV interview, he gave a statement
that, for a long time, was the only comment he would make about the
story.
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning's ``Today'' show continued reporting on it.
Meanwhile, the 10 a.m. taped show with host Hannah Storm led off
with the latest-breaking event, about Romanian gymnast Andreea
Raducan under investigation for a negative drug test. The
subsequent news about her gold medal for the all-around event being
stripped was finally announced at 7:30 p.m. on Monday night's
prime-time coverage _ although by then, all other news
organizations had reported that news.
</P>
<P>
   __ Figures and facts: Los Angeles has been one of the major
markets that has posted higher local ratings than the national
average for the NBC Olympic coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Through 10 days of the Sydney Games, the L.A. viewership is
producing a 19.1 rating and 33 share, according to Neilsen
research. The national average for NBC is 14.7/26, which went up a
notch after Sunday's 16.1/26 posting.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was the best night of ratings NBC has had so far, but
it's equal to the figure that it had guaranteed advertisers who
kicked in more than $900 million.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City, which hosts the 2002 Winter Games, has the best
local rating of any of the 48 metered markets with a 22.7/41
number. No. 1 TV market New York is averaging 16.3/26.

WEAPONS PLANT CLOUDED IN SECRECY AND UNCERTAINTY CARRIES LEGACY OF
POLLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLETOWN, Iowa _ This place helped beat back Hitler and
Mussolini and Hirohito. It gave Lyndon Johnson the firepower to
carpet bomb Southeast Asia. It fortified America in the standoff
with the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   Those enemies are past. But the men and women who made this an
arsenal of democracy cannot rest easy.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its history, the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant bears a
legacy of monumental pollution and, some suspect, disease.
</P>
<P>
   This sprawling collection of buildings amid overgrown weeds and
farm fields started out producing rifle bullets and bunker-busting
bombs. Then for decades it was part of the assembly line that kept
the country supplied with enough nuclear weapons for a month of
doomsdays.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, it supplies armor-piercing munitions by matching
explosives with depleted uranium.
</P>
<P>
   Yet much of the work here took place before Americans imagined
an Environmental Protection Agency or demanded an Occupational
Safety and Health Administration. Consequently, tales live on of
what is now considered unimaginably casual handling of the nasty
ingredients of modern warfare.
</P>
<P>
   So many high explosives were made, tested and tossed aside here
that dangerous ordnance still lurks among the weeds. So much TNT
residue spilled on the ground that for years creeks feeding the
Skunk and Mississippi rivers ran from milky pink to blood red.
Former workers tell decades-old stories of atomic bombs _ maybe
seeping radiation, maybe not _ left overnight in hallways.
</P>
<P>
   That lore is fuel for worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You signed so many papers and you can't talk about this and
you can't talk about that,'' said one former plant employee still
afraid to speak publicly about the experience. ``I worked there and
I'm still healthy. But you wonder...''
</P>
<P>
   The wonders are many. What were workers and nearby residents
exposed to? Is that exposure to blame for cancer? Were Cold War
paychecks cashed at the expense of long-term health?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there have been disastrous experiences among the
people who have loaded up nuclear weapons across the country. A
1997 report estimated 600,000 people nationwide ingested harmful
doses of radioactive particles between 1945 and 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The answers aren't in yet for the Iowa plant. Studies will have
to separate any risks of working at the plant from other risks,
such as a lifetime of smoking. Just tracking down a decent sample
of former workers is a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, partly because so many former workers still feel
bound by security-inspired oaths of secrecy, some things may prove
unknowable.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to build the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant came in
1939, when President Franklin Roosevelt was building the lend-lease
program aimed at arming America's European allies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, the Atomic Energy Commission began to put together
nuclear bomb-making facilities, swearing its contractors and their
employees to secrecy. From 1949 through most of 1951 the southeast
Iowa plant was the only place in the country assembling such
weapons. The bomb factory continued to crank out warheads until
1975, when that job was moved to a similar facility near Amarillo,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of World War II it employed 5,000. During the height
of the Vietnam War, more than 12,000 people pieced together all
manner of bullets and bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The plant was never home to the most sensitive part of nuclear
weapon manufacturing, where highly radioactive plutonium cores are
made. Rather, it received sealed nuclear components and mated them
with the conventional high explosives needed to set off an
atom-busting chain reaction.
</P>
<P>
   As such, experts say the risk of exposure to harmful radiation
probably would have been much lower at the Iowa plant than at the
places that delicately fashioned radioactive materials into nuclear
bomb components.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their risk would be a lot like that of service men and women
who handled the completed product,'' said Michael Garcia, a health
protection team leader for the Energy Department's offices in
Albuquerque, N.M. ``The risk shouldn't have been great.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, conditions in Middletown fell short of ideal. Records and
testing from the 1960s and '70s, considered crude by current
standards, hint that workers may have come in contact with
plutonium-tainted waste, tritium and depleted uranium.
</P>
<P>
   Tests on dummy nuclear bombs could have released small
radioactive clouds when depleted uranium _ a material from which
nearly all the uranium-235 used in nuclear reactions has been
removed and which is used for industrial purposes _ was exploded.
</P>
<P>
   In about 700 tests, fissionable material was replaced with
depleted uranium to judge whether the accompanying conventional
explosive would smash the nuclear components enough to set off an
atomic reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Those tests used more than four tons of depleted uranium.
</P>
<P>
   But even when scientists at the time were checking for problems,
their results proved frustratingly imprecise. Air monitors at the
time were located no closer than two miles from the test site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today,'' said Army Lt. Col. Bruce Elliott, who oversees the
plant, ``we realize things weren't taken into consideration at the
time that probably should have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for reasons still not entirely clear, worker health may
not have been monitored as closely as it was at other parts of the
American nuclear weapon assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the federal government decided in the spring to award
$520 million to 3,000 former nuclear workers from plants like those
at Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee, Rocky Flats in Colorado and
the Nevada Test Site.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa is pushing the Department of Energy
to be more forthcoming about what risks workers faced and to pay
for medical testing.
</P>
<P>
   He's pushing legislation that would require the Defense
Department and the Department of Energy (the successor to the
Atomic Energy Commission) to free workers to talk more about their
formerly classified work.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the health of our workers,'' Harkin said in a recent news
release, ``it's time for the Pentagon to come clean.''
</P>
<P>
   But fixing the mistakes won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   The land itself _ 19,000 acres, or roughly 6 miles long and
almost 5 miles wide _ is a patchwork of chemical surprises. The
soil is so tainted it has been designated an EPA Superfund site.
Cleanup is expected to take at least 15 more years and cost
taxpayers $110 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Kevin Howe of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers took
members of a local monitoring committee on a tour of the plant to
show them various reclamation projects.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped the group by one small hillside to watch a backhoe at
work. The soil had recently been discovered to contain 35 percent
barium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we dig a hole and take a sample,'' Howe said, ``it
looks worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the contaminated soil is being bulldozed into special
landfills. Some is burned. And for some of it, solutions have yet
to be chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of environmental problems, nearly all the result of
the making of conventional weapons, have been public knowledge for
years.
</P>
<P>
   But the more uncertain risks facing former nuclear weapons
workers pose different problems.
</P>
<P>
   Until Harkin responded to a letter from a former Atomic Energy
Commission worker last year, the plant's nuclear past was largely
forgotten. It was only after pressure from Harkin's office that the
Energy Department conceded the Iowa plant had once been a nuclear
weapons factory. Even now, the U.S. Army is mum on what has been
made there over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin's inquiries have prompted surveys at the plant that found
some records from the plant's nuclear age lost in storage. Recent
tests on buildings that once housed an atomic production line
discovered abnormal levels of radiation _ although not high enough
to meet the government's standards of a severe danger.
</P>
<P>
   When the Atomic Energy Commission closed down its operations in
the mid-1970s, it treated and then buried tons of dirt to keep
radiation in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AEC did decontaminate according to the standards of that
time,'' said Dave Bourne, the project manager for the plant's
environmental survey. ``Now we have a lot of work to do to see if
what they did then was good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Anderson, who worked as a security guard at the plant
from 1968 to 1973, said ``I don't think we did.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalls walking by nuclear weapons assemblies at night and
feeling the hair stand up on the back of his arms _ ``We'd just
walk a little farther away.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, he says, he's one of four security guards diagnosed with
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Two have died. Anderson was treated for his
illness in 1987 and has been healthy since.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he worries. He's convinced that lax standards damaged his
body and probably killed some of his friends. The planned studies,
he believes, will support what he feels intuitively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure my life is going to be shortened because of my
experience there,'' said Anderson, now 60 and working in nearby
Burlington. ``I just know that things there were done in a sloppy
way.''

A SWIPE AT SLASHERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- One of the National Hockey League rules
changes this season is designed to crack down on slashing. But so
far it has not helped Ziggy Palffy, who will miss tonight's game at
the Staples Center with an injured right index finger, or Marko
Tuomainen, who needed 10 stitches to close a gash on his face.
</P>
<P>
   Both were the victims of slashes that weren't called Saturday
during the Kings 4-1 victory over the San Jose Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, who was hit across the hands several times last season
by an opponent's stick, is the type of high-profile player the new
rules are expected to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was the kind of guy they wanted to take care
of,'' said Kings coach Andy Murray. ``I expect a crackdown early in
the season, but I'm not sure how long it will last.''
</P>
<P>
   The play that sidelined Palffy midway through Saturday's game
cost Kings winger Nelson Emerson more than a month last season.
Just five games after he was acquired from Atlanta, Emerson was
slashed across the right hand by Philadelphia's Daymond Langkow, an
injury so severe his index finger required several pins to set.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fine now, but I was hit so hard I could not grip the
stick,'' Emerson said. ``They didn't want to do anything for
several weeks for fear that I could fall and reinjure the finger.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHL sent the teams rules against slashing that forbids a
player to raise his stick above his waist to strike another player.
That includes his stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem will be interpretation,'' Murray said. ``Pinning
the other player's stick is what every coach will tell you is a
basic defensive move. Suddenly it is illegal. But something has to
be done. To see those things not called the other night was very
disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: Tonight's matchup against Phoenix will be the only
game televised during the exhibition season. It will be shown on
Fox Sports Net beginning at 7:30 p.m. . . . . The club was hoping
to activate Ian Laperriere for tonight's game, but doctors will not
clear his reconstructed right knee until Wednesday. He is expected
to play Friday in San Jose. . . . . Defenseman Jaroslav Modry will
not play tonight, but that is a good thing for him. Murray said
Modry, who played little last season after an outstanding camp,
looks like he has the team made and the Kings want to look at other
defensive prospects. . . . For now, left-winger Luc Robitaille has
been moved to the second line, teaming with center Bryan Smolinski
and right-winger Glen Murray. The second unit got off to an awful
start last season and Robitaille, last year's goal leader with 36,
is viewed as an offensive spark. But with the continued holdout of
first-line center Jozef Stumpel, Robitaille could return to the
first line. The Kings are hoping to start rookie Tomas Vlasak in
Robitaille's old spot.

COWBOYS OFFER NO DEFENSE TO RECORD-CAREENING SLIDE
</HEADLINE>
 DEFENSE-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ There apparently is no truth to the rumor that
Carolina running back Tshimanga Biakabutuka thinks it's Christmas
this week, just before he will be facing the Dallas Cowboys on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' much-maligned run defense has allowed two 200-yard
rushers _ Philadelphia's Duce Staley (201 on 26 carries) and San
Francisco's Charlie Garner (201 on 36 carries) _ through only the
first four weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   That's as many 200-yard rushers as the Cowboys allowed over
their first 594 regular-season games, dating to 1960. And one of
them was pro football legend Jim Brown in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping the run is Basic Defense 101, i.e. see the ball, tackle
the ball, and it is proved to be paramount to a team's success.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: The 1-3 Cowboys, who rank last in the NFL with an
average of 193.0 rushing yards allowed, which is on pace for 3,088
rushing yards allowed for the season. This would obliterate the
40-year-old team record of 2,242 yards, set in 1960 over a 12-game
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: The '78 Buffalo Bills (201.8), '80 New Orleans
Saints (194.1) and '78 Baltimore Colts (188.1) are the three worst
teams in NFL history against the run. They finished 5-11, 1-15 and
5-11, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: The NFL's five worst run defenses over the past
three seasons had a combined record of 18-62. They were the 2-14
expansion Cleveland Browns (171.0) in '99, the 3-13 Cincinnati
Bengals (163.3) in '98, the 3-13 Indianapolis Colts (160.6) in '98,
the 6-10 Arizona Cardinals (141.6) in '99, and the 4-12 Oakland
Raiders (140.4) in '97.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' run-stopping woes can be traced to many things,
including poor tackling, poor gap control and the off-season
free-agent losses of 1999 leading tackler Randall Godfrey (to
Tennessee) and run-control defensive end Kavika Pittman (to
Denver).
</P>
<P>
   And there is more to it than cranking up the intensity level.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just go out there flying around ... hitting
everything that moves. That won't get it done,'' said Alonzo
Spellman, who has split time this season between end and tackle.
``We talk like that because that gets everyone in the right frame
of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Gap control?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what our defense is based on,'' Spellman replied.
``Beginning Sunday _ excuse me, beginning Wednesday _ we just have
to get back to basics and emphasis the small things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have squandered momentum after upsetting Washington
on ``Monday Night Football'' a week ago. Stephen Davis was ``held''
to 91 rushing yards that night. Actually, Davis remains the only
opposing running back this season to fail to have a career-game or
a season-best game against the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Staley followed his season-opening 201 yards rushing at Texas
Stadium with 115 yards in his next three games combined. Arizona
rookie Thomas Jones rushed for 70 yards against the Cowboys and
only 40 yards in his other two games this season. Garner averaged
74 yards rushing per game until Sunday when he racked up 201.
</P>
<P>
   Now along comes Biakabutuka, who is averaging a modest 69.3
yards rushing this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a little bit of back-step this week,'' Cowboys coach
Dave Campo said. ``As coaches, we now have to be more demanding and
start paying closer attention to detail. We need to force
discipline and consistency on our guys to where they know where
they're supposed to be, and when they're supposed to be there ...
whipping blocks and getting to the football.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Cowboys' past defensive coordinator, Campo saw to it that
the run defense improved 100 percent each year from 24th in the NFL
in '97 to 12th in '98 to sixth last season when Cowboys' opponents
averaged only 90.1 rushing yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   While there are subtle changes to what players are asked to do
under first-year defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer, Campo insisted
Monday, ``It's not a case of what we call; it's how we play.''
