NO DOMBROWSKI MEETING _ LASORDA
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Interim general manager Tom Lasorda denied reports
Wednesday that the Dodgers already have spoken to Florida GM Dave
Dombrowski, saying the club has not received permission from
Marlins President Don Smiley for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda said he hopes permission is granted within the next two
days when the Dodgers are in Miami to play the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hopeful to get that so we can begin the process of
finding the new GM,,'' Lasorda said. ``We'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Dombrowski, who did not meet with the Dodgers last weekend when
the Marlins were in Los Angeles, is one of several candidates the
Dodgers have targeted as a possible successor to Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   The others: Cincinnati GM Jim Bowden, Baltimore assistant GM
Kevin Malone, Mets assistant Omar Minaya, Braves assistant Dean
Taylor and former Yankees GM Bob Watson. Lasorda will interview
Taylor this weekend when the Dodgers are in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Dombrowski, however, is a favorite of the new owners at Fox. But
like former Dodgers GM Fred Claire, Dombrowski was not part of the
negotiations in the May 15 Mike Piazza trade. Fox chairman Chase
Carey dealt directly with Smiley, who has been trying since the
World Series to put together a group of investors to buy the
Marlins from Wayne Huizenga.
</P>
<P>
   __ Valdes update: Dodgers right-hander Ismael Valdes experienced
no discomfort in his strained left-thigh muscle on day after
throwing his first simulated game since going on the disabled list
July 27. With the Dodgers now headed to Florida for two games with
the Marlins, Valdes will pitch Saturday for Class-A Vero Beach in a
rehabilitation assignment.
</P>
<P>
   He then will return to Los Angeles, where doctors will decide
whether he needs another rehab start.
</P>
<P>
   If Valdes rejoins the starting rotation, either Wednesday's
starter Brian Bohanon or tonight's starter Dave Mlicki will head to
the bullpen. Before Wednesday's loss, Bohanon had allowed seven
earned runs in his six previous starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think with the way I've pitched that there is any way
I deserve to be taken out of the starting rotation,'' Bohanon said.
``They already have two lefties (Scott Radinsky and Mark Guthrie)
down there. There isn't room for a third.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick hit: Tracy Woodson, a reserve third baseman on the
Dodgers 1988 World Series championship club, was a visitor to Three
Rivers Stadium. Woodson, who retired in 1996, is in his first year
as manager of the Pirates rookie club in Erie, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two 17-year olds, three 18-year olds and two 19-year
olds in my starting lineup. It's something,'' Woodson said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Woodson met with Lasorda, his former manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him this is a great age to manage, when it is all
new,'' Lasorda said. ``I said I wish I was a mouse in his clubhouse
listening to one of his meetings.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prosecutors have demanded a sample of President
Clinton's genetic material to establish forensic proof that his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky was sexual, a lawyer familiar
with the request said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton admitted to a federal grand jury Monday that he had
``inappropriate intimate physical contact'' with Ms. Lewinsky in
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The move by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr strongly suggests
that the FBI crime lab has determined that a dress turned over to
prosecutors by Ms. Lewinsky contained DNA evidence of a sexual
encounter.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether Starr made his request for genetic
material before or after the president testified. But Clinton's
team had hoped that the need for such testing was made moot by the
president's admission in his testimony and a brief speech Monday
night. In the speech, he called his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky
``not appropri- ate.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior presidential adviser said Clinton's lawyers would not
challenge Starr's request. White House press secretary Mike McCurry
said any sample could be obtained from tissue samples stored at
Bethesda Naval Hospital, where Clinton undergoes annual physicals.
</P>
<P>
   The request became public a day before Ms. Lewinsky, who was
said by friends to feel hurt by the president's terse public
description of their relationship, is scheduled to appear for a
second time before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's request suggested that he is determined to learn the
specific nature of the physical contact between Clinton and Ms.
Lewinsky, presumably in an effort to find inconsistencies between
Clinton's and Ms. Lewinsky's accounts and to establish whether he
committed perjury in his deposition in the Paula Jones case when he
denied having a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his advisers believe that such an effort could work to
the president's political benefit as Congress weighs conducting
impeachment hearings. They say it could make prosecutors look
sex-obsessed, even as most Americans tell pollsters that they
already know more than they would like about lies, betrayal, and
sexual indiscretion at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   A careful vagueness about his encounters with Ms. Lewinsky is
central to the president's legal and political strategy, his
advisers say, since it may help deflect a possible perjury charge
while also walling off seamy details from an already queasy public.
Clinton was even more vague in his four-minute address Monday night
than in his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton refused to give prosecutors a detailed description of
his physical contact with Ms. Lewinsky, after reading a statement
admitting an inappropriate relationship at the beginning of his
four-hour testimony. Starr has been seeking to determine if Clinton
committed perjury in January, when he denied any sexual
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in a deposition in the Jones sexual
misconduct lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony Monday, Clinton argued that the type of
relationship he had with Ms. Lewinsky did not fit the definition of
sex used by the Jones lawyers. Although he rebuffed prosecutors'
questions about his sexual contact with Ms. Lewinsky, he did answer
a series of questions about what types of sex he considered to be
covered by that definition, one Clinton adviser said Wednesday. The
president said that oral sex, among other acts, was not covered by
the definition, the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   But the adviser to Clinton said that he did not acknowledge
having oral sex or any other type of specific sexual contact with
Ms. Lewinsky, instead referring prosecutors back to his initial
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over and over, he said, `I've already said that it was
improper,''' said the adviser, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   That speech was watched by 67.6 million people, Nielsen Media
Research said Wednesday. Some 53 million viewers watched his far
longer State of the Union Message, delivered shortly after Clinton
was first accused of having an affair with Ms. Lewinsky and
covering it up.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton advisers have said that Clinton answered every question
put to him that did not deal with sex. That position is also
central to the president's political defense. If Starr demands
further testimony, the president's team would like to be able to
argue that prosecutors are intent on grilling him only about
intimate matters. ``We want to make the argument that Starr's
investigation is just about sex,'' the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, Clinton's private lawyer, did not agree to extend
his testimony more than a few minutes beyond the four-hour time
limit, even though prosecutors had more questions. Starr said that
he might subpoena Clinton for further testimony.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The White House would not confirm the request for samples of
Clinton's genetic material from Starr's office. It released a
two-sentence statement: ``On Monday night the president
acknowledged an improper relationship and apologized for that. The
president also said it's time to reclaim his privacy, and we will
respect that by not commenting on every leak generated by this
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Lewinsky prepared to testify, she was said by friends to
be unhappy about Clinton's speech. Ms. Lewinsky, her friends and
associates said, was dismayed to hear what she regarded as an
18-month, emotional relationship with Clinton, which included gifts
of poetry and neckties, acknowledged as merely an inappropriate
dalliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an older man who made all the instances and
references to a younger woman that this relationship was not just
about sex,'' one friend said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky has told friends that she was trying to protect the
president when she signed the affidavit falsely in January that she
had not had a sexual relationship. And in the seven months since,
Ms. Lewinsky has been ``profoundly disappointed'' that the White
House has quietly attempted to smear her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's friends said that she had always intended to tell
the truth before the grand jury, so her feelings would have no
impact on her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Since the president acknowledged an improper relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky on Monday night, White House advisers and prominent
Democrats have been disclosing their wounded feelings over the
intimate revelations of recent days. Some appear to be bidding for
publicly sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Others are just downright mad. Among them is Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., who said Tuesday that her trust in Clinton's
credibility had been ``badly shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days just after the Lewinsky accusations were disclosed
last January, Clinton sought to reassure Senator Feinstein by
privately telling her that Ms. Lewinsky had had to be transferred
from the White House because she was fantasizing about him, and
``on the verge of stalking him,'' a person close to Ms. Feinstein
said Wednesday. Friends said that helped explain Ms. Feinstein's
strong statement of disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   On vacation at a borrowed Martha's Vineyard estate, Clinton
celebrated his 52nd birthday Wednesday night with Vernon Jordan,
his friend and confidant. It was the first extended time that the
two men and their families spent together since Jordan was
subpoenaed by Starr to explain his role late last year in helping
Ms. Lewinsky find a job in New York. He has denied any effort to
help hide her relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   The president awoke Wednesday to calls for his resignation from
some editorialists and Republican congressmen. His advisers
dismissed such statements as the chattering of Washington elites,
saying that the public had heard more than it wanted to hear about
the Lewinsky investigation, and was anxious for the federal
government to turn to matters of policy.
</P>
<P>
   Some allies of the president said Starr was trying to make
crimes of private indiscretions. ```I think the criminalization of
bad sexual judgment is something we ought not to be doing,'' said
James Carville, the president's former campaign manager. ``It's
just loony.''

STUART REGAN, 39, ART DEALER, FILM PRODUCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stuart Regen, a Los Angeles art dealer who also helped develop
the Oscar-winning movie ``Leaving Las Vegas,'' died Aug. 18 at a
hospital in Los Angeles. He was 39 and lived in West Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   He had been battling non-Hodgkin's lymphoma for nearly a decade,
his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Regen was born in 1959 in New York City and was a graduate of
Skidmore College, where he studied arts administration. His
interest in art stemmed partly from that of his mother, Barbara
Gladstone, who opened her own gallery in Manhattan in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Regen's first job in the art world was chief preparator at PS 1,
an alternative space in Long Island City, Queens. In 1985 and '86,
he worked briefly as an assistant at a gallery in Cologne, Germany,
and then moved to Los Angeles, working as director of the Fred
Hoffman Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1989, five weeks after he was diagnosed with cancer,
he opened his own gallery in West Hollywood. At first he
concentrated on artists from New York and Europe, some represented
by his mother, whose work was not well known in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 he married Shaun Caley, who became his business partner.
In 1992, as the art market waned, the couple relocated to a smaller
space next door to the gallery, which they renamed Regen Projects.
They began to focus on Los Angeles artists like Lari Pittman and
Charles Ray, as well as such emerging artists as Toba Khedoori,
Laura Owens, Catherine Opie, Frances Stark and Jennifer Pastor, who
were often showing their work for the first time. The couple gave
New York sculptor and filmmaker Matthew Barney his first gallery
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles stimulated Regen's interests in the movies. In the
early 1990s, after reading ``Leaving Las Vegas,'' a
semi-autobiographical novel by John O'Brien, he met with the
writer, optioned the book and contacted his friend Mike Figgis, who
eventually directed the award-winning 1995 movie based on the book.
Regen was credited as associate producer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife and his mother, Regen is survived by his
grandmother, Evelyn Leavitt of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and two
brothers, David and Richard, both of Manhattan.

   Richard Boswell Finn, 80, Expert on Japan &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Richard Boswell Finn, a former naval intelligence officer,
diplomat and scholar of Japanese affairs, died Aug. 17 at Sibley
Memorial Hospital in Washington. He was 80 and lived in Bethesda,
Md.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Finn was the author of ``Winners in Peace: MacArthur, Yoshida
and Postwar Japan'' (University of California Press, 1992), and
edited a ``U.S.-Japan Relations'' series issued by Transaction
Publications.
</P>
<P>
   Finn was born in Niagara Falls, N.Y., and graduated from Harvard
College in 1939 and from Harvard Law School in 1942. He attended
the Navy's Japanese language school in Boulder, Colo., entered
Naval Intelligence, then became a Foreign Service Officer and
remained in Japan until 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Later he was an adjunct professor at American University and
administered Harvard's U.S.-Japan Program from 1983 to 1987. The
Japanese government awarded him an imperial decoration in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Finn is survived by his wife of 56 years, Dallas Rumsey Finn;
two daughters, Allison Finn of Tallahassee, Fla., and Vaughan Finn
of West Hartford; and four grandsons.
</P>
<P>
   Claire M. Smith, 64, Literary Agent
</P>
<P>
   Claire M. Smith, a literary agent and a former president of
Harold Ober Associates, a Manhattan literary agency, died Aug. 15
at her home in South Prospect Park, Brooklyn. She was 64.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was lung cancer, a spokeswoman for the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Smith, whose clients included Richard Adams, Judy Blume,
Dean Koontz and James Herriot, began her career as a secretary at
Alfred A. Knopf. In 1959 she joined the Ober agency. Her first
success came with ``The Incredible Journey,'' a novel by Sheila
Burnford about the travels of two dogs and a cat across the
Canadian wilderness. The book has been the basis for three Disney
films.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Smith is survived by her husband, Robert Kimmel Smith, an
author; a daughter, Heidi M. Smith of San Francisco; a son, Roger
K. Smith of New York City, and a sister, Harriet M. Levine of
Orangeburg, N.Y.

OUR TOWNS: IN LOVE CANAL, HIS HOUSE IS STILL A HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOVE CANAL, N.Y. _ All Chester Pysz wants is to live in peace in
the little house in Love Canal he bought 44 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He figures he is not asking for much. Divorced, his three
daughters all grown up, he lives alone here, spending his days
listening to a scanner that summons him to trouble. ``I'm a
volunteer fireman 18 years now,'' he said, standing on the porch
with the screen door ajar so he could monitor fire calls. ``Why,
there are days,'' he said, ``that I'm barely home eight hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people would say that the less time Pysz spends home the
better, since he lives where the government said no one should. His
house is in what the Environmental Protection Agency refers to as
one of Love Canal's ``nonhabitable'' zones.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, when the government found that this
neighborhood built around a canal filled with 22,000 tons of liquid
toxic wastes was contaminated and should be evacuated, about 800
families moved. Pysz was one of the ones who stayed put. Ten years
later, when the EPA declared parts of the infamous neighborhood
``habitable,'' and began refurbishing 239 abandoned houses, Pysz
was one of the ones who said told you so. But while his block
stands across the road from a row of freshly rehabilitated,
vinyl-sided houses, it is still considered an unfit place to live.
</P>
<P>
   With almost all the rehabilitated houses sold and the
neighborhood rechristened ``Black Creek Village,'' Pysz's block on
101st Street remains a grim reminder of Love Canal's legacy as one
of the most polluted places on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   His row of 15 houses _ ``there was one next door that got torn
down a couple of months ago'' _ is almost entirely abandoned. One
lonely little Cape Cod after another sits with its windows boarded
and the lawn left to nature and the kids who come around for kicks
after dark. The same goes for the row of houses across the street
from Pysz, and the one behind him, directly in front of the
fenced-in canal. Signs of the life the neighborhood once had _
yellow curtains in a kitchen window, stubborn day lilies reaching
for the sun in a side yard _ only make it look sadder.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, Pysz has had one neighbor on his street, an
elderly man a few houses away. Over the weekend, the neighbor, 95
years old, died. Now there's just Pysz, a retired welder going on
71. His last neighbor in this entire nonhabitable zone near the
fenced-in canal lives on 102d Street, another strip of empty
houses.
</P>
<P>
   Pysz's new neighbors across the road, and everywhere else in the
``habitable'' Black Creek Village, believe Pysz and the other 10
holdouts in all of Love Canal's nonhabitable zones should move. The
new people want all reminders of the place that gave birth to
Superfund laws buried like the wastes that still sit in the canal.
</P>
<P>
   The nonhabitable zones raise a troubling question to those who
believe that Love Canal, by any other name, remains a health
hazard. Critics of the new Black Creek Village could point to the
block where Pysz lives, and then across the road, and ask: Why is
one block OK to live in and another 50 yards away not?
</P>
<P>
   That question, said Susan Bloss, director of the Love Canal Area
Revitalization Agency, has been asked time and time again. ``The
EPA's habitability study looked at properties on an area basis,''
she said. ``Because sampling in one spot in an area found
contamination, the whole area was declared nonhabitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to people like Pysz, who believes that Love Canal's
evacuation was a mistake made by politicians fueled by public
panic, if one area is habitable, so is the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people can live there, then I can live here,'' he said,
gesturing across the road. His soil, he added, has come clean in
several tests. He pointed to the perky pink roses growing next to
his front door and a young crimson maple by the curb. ``You can't
kill these things,'' he said. ``I planted that tree two years ago
and it's growing beautifully.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bloss said the revitalization agency reserves the right to
condemn Pysz's house if a developer wants it. Over the next several
months, she said, the abandoned houses that have become sorry
reminders of Love Canal will finally be torn down. Then the land
will be sold for light manufacturing or an office park. For those
purposes, the nonhabitable areas are considered habitable.
</P>
<P>
   But Pysz said he'll fight to stay here. He plans to live in his
house forever, he said. ``Then, my daughters get it.''

NEUBERGER &AMP; BERMAN SET TO SELL 15% STAKE IN A PUBLIC OFFERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Neuberger &AMP; Berman, the investment-management
partnership founded in 1939 by Roy R. Neuberger, the well-known
investor and art benefactor, said Wednesday that it planned to sell
15 percent of its shares in an initial public offering that would
value the company at $1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which after the offering will be known as Neuberger
Berman Inc., will seek to raise up to $250 million, one-fifth of
which could be used to repay capital to the firm's current
partners. The remainder will be earmarked for general corporate
purposes, including possible acquisitions, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the offering comes as stock prices of
money-management companies have suffered amid the recent market
turmoil. Shares of several mutual fund companies that have recently
sold stock to the public, including Federated Investors Inc. and
Waddell &AMP; Reed Financial Inc., are now trading below their initial
offering prices.
</P>
<P>
   Best known as an adviser to wealthy individuals and
institutional investors, Neuberger &AMP; Berman last year saw its
mutual fund unit take over as its largest business segment. The
growth came even as several of the 35 Neuberger &AMP; Berman funds
lagged behind the market indexes and competing funds.
</P>
<P>
   Neuberger &AMP; Berman generally follows a value style, seeking out
stocks whose prices have been beaten down. That style has fallen
behind as companies with fast-growing earnings have commanded
higher stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of June, the company managed $59.1 billion in assets,
80 percent of which were invested in equities. They include $23.7
billion in mutual funds, $17.8 billion in accounts of
high-net-worth individuals, $16 billion of pension fund and other
institutional assets and $1.6 billion in other accounts.
</P>
<P>
   While Neuberger's mutual fund business has grown rapidly, its
institutional business has been flat since the end of 1995. Chief
administrative officer Jeffrey Lane attributed that lack of growth
to the slowing of the traditional, defined-benefit pension
business, which is being replaced at many companies by
defined-contribution retirement plans like 401(k)'s.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Neuberger's profitability measures up to some of the
best-performing money management companies, according to pro forma
financial statements included in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on Wednesday.

<P>
   Last year, on a pro forma basis, Neuberger earned pretax profits
of $221.6 million on revenue of $626 million, for a pretax profit
margin of 35.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That compares favorably with the performance of Franklin
Resources, parent of the Franklin Templeton group of mutual funds,
which recorded a pretax profit margin of 28.4 percent in the year
ended Sept. 30, and of T. Rowe Price Associates, whose pretax
margin equaled 35 percent last year.

WHERE HAVE YOU GONE, TYRONE WHEATLEY? 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The blueprint for the redesigned Giants backfield
will be unveiled in Thursday night's preseason game with the Jets:
Gary Brown as the starter at halfback, Tiki Barber as the
third-down specialist and Charles Way as the fullback who
frequently switches to a halfback carrying the football.
</P>
<P>
   And where does Tyrone Wheatley fit in?
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Brown, whom the Giants signed as a free agent this past
winter, will have to run well against the Jets to solidify his
position as the principal halfback. An injury to one of the first
three backs could always vault Wheatley back into the mix, and
Barber will never be too far from the picture, getting carries on
first and second downs as well.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing Way's role as a featured back remains a priority.
</P>
<P>
   But conspicuous by his absence in coach Jim Fassel's discussion
of his backfield designs for the Jets game was Wheatley, who was to
get carries only in second-half mop-up time, playing with the
second- and third-string units.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, as the Giants broke training camp with a final light
workout, Fassel said he had not decided anything with his backs,
but he did not even mention Wheatley in a broad explanation of what
he is looking for from the Giants' running backs on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary Brown will start the game,'' Fassel said, replacing
Barber in the starting lineup for the first time this preseason.
``That doesn't mean Gary Brown is now the starter. But we're going
to have Tiki returning punts and playing in the third-down
packages. We'll get Charles Way in there some carrying the
football. And Tiki will take some regular down stuff, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel went on to mention Greg Comella and Eric Lane, the two
players vying for the backup fullback spot, confirming that they
would see time as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The priority is seeing Gary Brown with the first unit,''
Fassel finally said.
</P>
<P>
   Where have you gone, Tyrone Wheatley, the first-round draft pick
of 1995?
</P>
<P>
   Wheatley's shot at winning the starting job apparently came last
week, when he got his only chance of the preseason to play behind
the first-string offensive line. Wheatley had 21 yards on eight
carries in the Giants' dreadful 24-10 loss to Jacksonville.
Wheatley's longest run was 5 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel acknowledged after the game that the offensive line
opened few holes for Wheatley against Jacksonville, but he did not
praise the running back either.
</P>
<P>
   It has probably been Fassel's plan all along to play Brown with
the first team against the Jets in the team's third preseason game,
and the timing is revealing.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every National Football League coach uses the third
exhibition game as the turning point of the preseason. It is the
game when the team's starters play for the longest period and it is
considered to be the closest thing to a true dress rehearsal for
the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   By the fourth and final preseason game, the team's depth chart
is all but decided, and coaches are too worried about injuries to
play their starters for more than a quarter with the regular season
only a week away. It often becomes the sloppiest game of the
preseason, a free-for-all of players auditioning for the last few
spots available on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   That is a game in which Wheatley could see a significant number
of carries. And it is not entirely inconceivable that it could be
Wheatley's last appearance as a Giant.
</P>
<P>
   That remains an unlikely scenario because other than Brown and
Barber, the Giants have no other true halfbacks. But if Way's role
is to be expanded as a featured back, and if Fassel is looking for
a way to keep both Comella and Lane on the team _ or an extra
receiver or linebacker for special teams help _ Wheatley's run with
the Giants could be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   So while Wheatley's future, like his entire Giants career, is
still a puzzle, there is little doubt that Brown can secure a place
of prominence in the team's plans with a productive outing against
the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who ran for 945 yards with the San Diego Chargers last
season, has timed his audition well.
</P>
<P>
   Criticized last week for its performance against Jacksonville,
the Giants' offensive line is poised to have a good game. The
team's best offensive lineman, right guard Ron Stone, is returning
to the lineup after missing the Jacksonville game because of an
ankle sprain. As a unit, the line has practiced with renewed
intensity this week, seeming to rally in the face of the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has looked strong running between the tackles in training
camp. He does not have breakaway speed, but at 5 feet 9 inches he
can cleverly pick his way through small openings in the line. And
at 230 pounds, he is a force at the point of attack.

CAPTAIN OF ALL-MADDEN VIDEO-GAME TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID EINSTEIN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
For Scott Orr more than for most people, life is a game.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The game is Madden NFL, which Orr oversees as executive producer
for EA Sports, a division of video-game giant Electronic Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Orr, 42, helped create the game eight years ago and has
developed it into something like a franchise property. Madden NFL _
for computer and all major video-game platforms _ has sold more
than 11 million copies over the years. It was the top-selling
interactive football game last year, according to the NPD Group
research firm, and is EA's most successful title.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, Orr and a team of producers, designers, artists and
programmers craft a new version of Madden NFL, incorporating new
NFL players and teams as well as improvements in technology. Madden
NFL 99, the latest version, is scheduled for release next month to
coincide with the start of football season.
</P>
<P>
   Orr also personally heads up development of several other EA
Sports games _ Nascar Racing, NCAA March Madness Basketball and
NCAA Football. But closest to his heart is the Madden game, which
has earned him the unofficial title of ``father of interactive
football.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The genius of the guy is that he has always been able to
satisfy both the sports fan in you and the gamer,'' says Bill
Kunkel, who has known Orr since the video game industry started to
unfold in the early 1980s. ``He gives you realism but also makes
sure that playability is the primary thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Orr, who grew up in Santa Barbara, started off playing pinball _
mainly because there were no video games. But then along came Pong,
which ushered in a new industry and kindled Orr's passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pong was a revelation to me,'' he says. ``I was always really
into the competitive nature of games, and when Pong and PacMan came
out in arcades, I was all over them.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Orr started a small game-publishing company that led to
his first real company, Gamestar, which developed games for the old
Atari and Commodore game consoles.
</P>
<P>
   Kunkel, who now is director of interactive development for
Platinum Studios in Beverly Hills, was one of the first video game
reviewers. He recalls how Orr would show him football and baseball
games he'd created at Gamestar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott would always want to know what was wrong with them,''
Kunkel says. ``He didn't want to hear how great they were. He
wanted to know how to make them better.''
</P>
<P>
   Orr says his chief obstacle back then was manufacturers'
reluctance to produce his sports games. ``They were leery because
they thought video games were for computer geeks who wanted
adventure and role-playing games and not sports games,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Orr sold Gamestar to Activision. He left in 1988 to
work as an independent consultant and began doing work for EA in
1990. In that capacity, he co-designed the first Madden game and
another one, NHL Hockey, both for the Sega Genesis console.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Orr joined EA as a full-time producer and took Madden
NFL under his wing, starting a run that would turn it into one of
the most successful video games.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, he says, ``It took one programmer, maybe one
part-time sound guy and one producer to put a game out. Now it's
much more akin to making a movie or a TV show, and the number of
people involved is extensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. At EA Sports' offices in San Mateo, Orr supervises 15
people involved with designing the Madden game, including producers
and specialists who work with sound, music and TV footage that goes
into the game's PC version.
</P>
<P>
   Once the design is complete, the game is developed by about 35
programmers and graphics specialists at EA's Tiburon Entertainment
unit in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The product then comes back to San Mateo, where some two dozen
testers make sure no bugs have survived.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the technology in Madden NFL has kept pace with
advances in video game consoles and PCs. The action today is
three-dimensional, the players nearly lifelike. And the camera
angles, zoom views and instant replay closely parallel the
experience of watching a real game.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the latest version is more spontaneous, thanks to
artificial intelligence algorithms built into it. ``For example,
with Madden NFL 99, defensive players will adjust their positions
because they know what their teammates are doing,'' Orr says.
``They'll know whether to play man-to-man or stay in a zone.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's going to get even better. Orr says that next year's
game will utilize something called inverse kinematics. When two
players collide, the resulting graphics will be determined by the
actual physics of the collision.
</P>
<P>
   About the only constants throughout the evolution of Madden NFL
have been Orr and the game's namesake, football commentator and
former Raiders coach John Madden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a close relationship with Madden,'' says Orr. ``We see
him four or five times a year, and he makes himself available when
we need him, which is remarkable given his schedule. He really
takes this thing seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   He should. The game has helped turn Madden into a brand name and
has introduced him to new generations of football fans.
</P>
<P>
   Madden's chief contribution, Orr says, is his insight into how
the game is played. ``He stresses realism and the one-on-one nature
of football, which is the essence of his philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past year, EA Sports has run into serious competition
from other football games. Sony's own NFL Gameday outsold Madden
NFL 98 for the Sony PlayStation, and Acclaim's NFL Quarterback beat
Madden on the Nintendo 64.
</P>
<P>
   But because it spans all the platforms and the others don't,
Madden handily took the overall sales title while generating annual
revenues of $80 million. (EA's total sales were $909 million in
fiscal 1998.)
</P>
<P>
   It also helped EA Sports increase its share of the sports-game
market from 51 to 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That surprised a lot of people,'' Orr says, ``because Sony and
Acclaim were spending money to suggest that EA was losing its
luster.''

BRODERBUND STOCK DROPS 19 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By BENNY EVANGELISTA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Shares in Broderbund Software Inc. of Novato fell about 19 percent
yesterday after an analyst questioned the accounting procedures of
the company that is about acquire it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Officials for both Broderbund and the Learning Co., as well as
other Wall Street analysts, discounted the report as a
``misinterpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless the analyst's report triggered a precipitous slide
in the stock prices of both companies, which led to a subsequent
halt in their trading for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my satisfaction, I've been shown there are no account
irregularities,'' said analyst Stephen S. Fleming of BancAmerica
Robertson Stephens. ``It's a non-issue, a tempest in a teapot.''
</P>
<P>
   The tempest caused stock in Broderbund, the once fiercely
independent educational software-maker, to drop $4 per share to
$16.38 and stock in the Learning Co. to fall $5.13 to $20.63.
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Co., a Cambridge, Mass., maker of educational
software, announced in June that it was buying Broderbund for about
$420 million. Directors of both companies are scheduled to vote
separately on the deal August 31.
</P>
<P>
   The report that set off the stock slide came from Pacific Coast
Securities analyst Jeff Goverman, who said the Learning Co. had
underreported its accounts receivable by $25 million in the second
quarter in a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
</P>
<P>
   Goverman claimed that it would take much longer for the company
to collect its outstanding bills than it had previously indicated.
</P>
<P>
   However, officials for the Learning Co. denied any accounting
irregularities yesterday. They said Goverman had failed to consider
the fact that the company had sold some of its accounts receivable
at a discount to third-party debt collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Michael P. Wallace, an analyst with SBC Warburg Dillon Read,
agreed with that assessment. ``The issue has to do with how the
company finances its accounts receivable in the U.S. and
overseas,'' he said in a report. ``We see the sell-off today as
unwarranted and well overdone.''
</P>
<P>
   Goverman did not return a message left yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst privately said Learning Co.'s past reputation for
pushing accounting practices to the limit had created a credibility
problem with investors and caused the market's ``knee-jerk
reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming said the Broderbund-Learning Co. deal could have been
jeopardized if the accounting problem had been true and the stock
slide had continued.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expects both stocks to rebound today following the
clarification from Learning Co. officials.

SHUTTERED NAVAL BASE SLOWLY FILLING WITH TENANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By AMY DOAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Hangar 39 at the Alameda Naval Air Station used to hold helicopters
and fighter jets. Now it's home to chile peppers the size of Hondas
and a futuristic space port rising 30 feet above the ground.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Delphi Productions, which creates these surreal displays for
companies exhibiting at events like Fiesta Texas and the Comdex
high-tech trade show, recently signed a 10-year-lease for space at
the hangar.
</P>
<P>
   The company is one of several lured by the sweet deals and
plentiful space at the former base, which is slowly undergoing the
awkward process of converting from military to commercial use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked everywhere from Richmond to Brisbane, and there was
just no way we could find the kind of clearance and space we needed
anywhere else,'' said Delphi Vice President Anthony Erpelding.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to moving into what has been rechristened Alameda Point,
Delphi occupied 50,000 square feet of warehouse space in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Its new home is twice that size _ 108,000 square feet and 55
feet tall at the highest point. That gives the company plenty of
room to build its exhibits for such clients as Apple, Sony, Nike
and the Oakland Museum of California _ some of which can occupy as
much as 25,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 600 windows and only one column obstructing the
cavernous interior, it was easy for Delphi's designers to envision
how a creation like Novellus' 20-foot-tall ``Metal-morphosis
Chamber'' would appear on an exhibit floor.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber, on display earlier this year at the Semicon West
chip show, highlighted the switch in the chip industry from
aluminum to copper parts by pretending to remove aluminum from
visitors' bodies using steam and flashing lights. One part of the
exhibit featured a huge ``brainwashing'' screen that flashed
messages about copper.
</P>
<P>
   Although the hangar is perfectly suited to the assembly work
Delphi does, it is so huge that the company had to buy seven
bicycles to save employees from trekking across it all day.
</P>
<P>
   So far, nobody seems to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really fun, airy place to work that suits the
theatrical kind of industry we're in,'' said Erpelding. ``I can
look down on the carpentry shop, the painting areas and the storage
areas all at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Erpelding said the waterfront location also gives employees
inspiring views of the bay and the reserve ships anchored nearby.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the lease rates were ``very attractive'' and
that much of the $1 million it needed to retrofit the hangar was
covered by federal grants.
</P>
<P>
   Lease rates at the Point start at 25 cents a square foot and
average about 10 percent below market rates for comparable
industrial space in the Bay Area, according to Mike Hampen, manager
of the Alameda Reuse and Redevelopment Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ARRA was set up by the city to attract civilian tenants to the
base, which was built in 1940 and used primarily to repair disabled
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bargain lease rates, it will be some time before the
base is fully occupied.
</P>
<P>
   The land is still owned by the Navy, which is in the final
stages of turning over the base for civilian use by the city of
Alameda and the California Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   While some shoreline property at the base in Alameda may be
protected, &UR;  &LR; more than 4 million square feet of building space has
been approved for a mix of commercial, industrial and residential
use.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the turnover process, or ``reconveyance,'' is likely to
be long and complicated.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is how much of the $120 million tab for bringing the
Point up to current building code will be paid by the Navy, said
Kay Miller, executive director of ARRA.
</P>
<P>
   There's clearly a lot of work to do. Some of the bunkers,
aircraft hangars and officers' homes are condemned. Other buildings
are plagued with lead contamination, sewage and electrical
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge of bringing it up to code is comparable to that
faced by Vallejo's Mare Island Conversion Center, according to a
consultant who has worked on both projects.
</P>
<P>
   The Mare Island Shipyard closed in 1996, but the terms of the
financing package are still being negotiated, said Jonathan Stern
of Berkeley's Bay Area Economics consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Such conversions are usually financed by a combination of city
funds, federal grants, municipal bonds and lease revenue, but
working out the details is a tortuous process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Hamilton Air Force Base _ it closed in 1970, and the
agreements still aren't final,'' said Hampen. ``We're talking about
a very slow process, no matter how much both sides want things
done.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  It's been more than a year since the Navy officially closed
the base &UR; ,  &LR; in April 1997, and only about 32 percent of the
buildings are leased, according to ARRA's Hampen.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge ARRA faces is evident after a quick walk around
the Point. Many of the usable buildings don't exactly have what
brokers call ``curb appeal'' _ they're low and uninviting.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another hurdle, according to ARRA, is that companies with
space requirements like Delphi's are rare.
</P>
<P>
   ARRA is considering partially demolishing or resizing some of
the bunkers to suit small research-and-development and
light-industrial tenants, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One industry that doesn't mind the huge and less-than-glamorous
facilities is Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Several production companies, including George Lucas' Industrial
Light &AMP; Magic and Manex Entertainment, find the size and privacy of
Alameda Point ideal for soundstage work.
</P>
<P>
   Manex recently leased a portion of a hangar to build a studio,
and it has rented other buildings on a short-term basis to shoot
``Flubber,'' a movie starring Robin Williams, and ``The
Rainmaker,'' a movie based on John Grisham's best-selling novel.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial Light &AMP; Magic also leases space occasionally to
produce special effects for commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The seasonal interest from Hollywood is encouraging, but ARRA is
hoping for long-term occupants.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said that ARRA is considering sending out
requests-for-proposal to film studios like Manex that are
interested in permanent studio space.
</P>
<P>
   ARRA is also courting potential tenants in such burgeoning
industries as electric cars.
</P>
<P>
   The tenant list at the Alameda Naval Air Station now includes a
sheet-metal fabricator, a records storage firm, a church and a
swap-meet company.
</P>
<P>
   ARRA says the leases will generate almost $1.7 million in annual
revenues, which covers its $1 million-per-year expenses but doesn't
make much of a dent in the costs of renovation. ARRA's Miller said
the Point probably will not turn a profit until 2012.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the long haul ahead, Hampen is optimistic. ``There's a
lot of potential here. You just have to look beyond how things are
set up now to the possibilities for some of these buildings,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hampen knows the buildings as well as anyone _ he worked in them
for 13 years as a Navy master chief. He said it hurt to watch the
once-bustling base, which had employed 15,000 people and flew more
than 500 sorties a day, turn into a ghost town.
</P>
<P>
   Even factoring in expected leases, there will be only about
1,200 jobs at the base by the turn of the century. ``But it'll be
exciting to see it gradually brought back to life,'' Hampen said.

ADOBE'S HEAD HONCHOS TAKE A TURN IN CORPORATE HOT SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   By TOM ABATE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
In the wake of last week's layoffs at Adobe Systems, some in
Silicon Valley are wondering whether the cuts should have started
at the top, with co-founders John Warnock and Chuck Geschke.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Whenever you go through this kind of thing, you ask, `Am I the
problem? Is it time?' '' Warnock said.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe has gone through two executive shakeups in 10 months. Last
fall, Warnock and Geschke, who are co-chairmen, ousted former Chief
Operating Officer Dave Pratt, a nine-year Adobe veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, they forced out three execs hired after Pratt
departed: Chief Financial Officer Jack Bell, marketing czar Robert
Roblin and product manager Ross Bott.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the outside, you could look at multiple executive changes
and conclude the problem was at the top,'' Warnock admitted.
</P>
<P>
   But he says he and Geschke finally have an executive team, with
new CFO Harold Covert and marketer Bruce Chizen, to turn the
graphics-software giant around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand this business as well as anybody on the
planet,'' he said. ``What we've had is an execution problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say Adobe's problems began long before the earnings
disappointment that preceded last week's shakeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a company whose stock has gone nowhere for two
years,'' said one Silicon Valley insider. ``John and Chuck are nice
guys, but their hanging around just prevents the company from
bringing in someone who can turn the situation around.''
</P>
<P>
   Another critic says that Adobe, though master in print
publishing, has let Microsoft, Sun and Netscape set standards in
Web publishing.
</P>
<P>
   Says a third source in the venture capital community: ``I don't
see John or Chuck at the front of the (industry) parade like they
were 10 or 12 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Warnock disputes each barb. Adobe may yet create a standard
around its Acrobat software for sending documents over the Web.
It's working on new software tools that will let people author
content once and publish it in any medium _ paper, disk or Web.
</P>
<P>
   He says critics will see the first signs of progress in better
financials. ``We'll know within 90 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, Warnock counters any suggestion that it's time for
the inventors of desktop publishing software to go out to pasture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck and I understand the publishing market and have defended
it for 15 years,'' he said. ``We're not living in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   _ BANKING BLUES? Like the air shimmering over hot asphalt,
rumors are emanating from the offices of NationsBank Montgomery
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the situation said Montgomery CEO Thom Weisel
and his managing directors have been meeting over the last few days
to discuss whether the ``golden handcuffs'' _ financial inducements
to keep top managers in place after NationsBank acquired Montgomery
last year _ should be loosened to allow execs to depart sooner than
the two or three years they were supposed to stay.
</P>
<P>
   A Montgomery representative declined comment on the rumor that
Jerry Markowitz, a Weisel ally, and another top director might make
an early exit if the cuffs were loosened &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some of Montgomery's 150 research analysts are
venting over other concerns. They used to get paid from a pot of
money, half of which came from investment banking profits, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   Henceforth, word is analysts will only get a 20 percent slice of
that banking fat. Moreover, analysts have supposedly been told to
spend more time covering the stocks of the larger firms in their
industries and less time doting on startups.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Ruth, co-director of research at Montgomery, wouldn't
discuss compensation rumors, but tried to put the coverage question
into context. As Montgomery continues its drive to challenge
top-tier investment banks _ such as Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs
and Morgan Stanley _ it wants to make sure its analysts have struck
the proper balance between covering small, fast-growing startups
and larger publicly held firms.
</P>
<P>
   But others in the investment banking world say that as
Montgomery _ and its rival Robertson, Stephens _ become part of
larger banks and step up to challenge New York-based investment
firms, they grow more distant from the Silicon Valley high-tech and
biomedical startups that used to butter their bread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recent comments from VCs indicate that they are starting to
see signs of these changes and are not happy about it,'' said a
Montgomery rival.

STERN TALKS TRASH ABOUT `SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not since Mr. T of ``The A-Team'' promised to poleax the Fonz
have we seen so much competitive scorn heaped on a rival television
show.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the source is Howard Stern, the king of all media
immodesty.
</P>
<P>
   ```Saturday Night Live' should now be called `Saturday Night
Dead,''' Stern crowed on his morning radio program from New York
this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the show that ceased being funny when John Belushi's
fat, speedball-filled corpse hit the deck, and you know that. Ever
since then, it's gone downhill.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern, whose syndicated Saturday night TV show debuts this week
on about 70 stations nationally, was also dispensing a sampling of
his celebrated grasp on tasteful entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Grasp? He has good taste by the throat, and he's kicking it in
the behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Howard Stern Radio Show'' is hardly likely to unseat the
top-rated ``SNL.'' But Stern might be the first serious competition
NBC's weekly comedy titan has faced in its 23 years on the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my show hits the airwaves this Saturday, and this is a
prediction, people will flock to it like maggots on fresh road kill
on a hot Texas day,'' Stern declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how I feel about it. I don't know about anybody else.
So I ask you, should the American public bow to me, accept me,
cater to me? Well, what else can they do? Accept the fact that I am
the greatest entertainer of the millennium, and I will lead the
Tiffany network into the next millennium. ...''
</P>
<P>
   The Tiffany network, or more accurately former Tiffany network,
is CBS. Stern's show was developed mainly for the group of
CBS-owned stations with the full blessing of Mel Karmazin,
president of CBS Corp. But it isn't truly a network show _ probably
to the relief of some traditionalists at the network.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Howard Stern Radio Show'' is syndicated by CBS' Eyemark
Entertainment wing. The stations that will air it aren't all CBS
affiliates. And it won't be seen at all in a few major TV markets,
notably Dallas and Sacramento, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Stern is making his customary pledges of class entertainment _
porn queens, nude makeovers, tuneful flatulence. But little of the
Saturday night program will be original. As the title indicates,
it'll be mostly a ``best-of'' compilation videotaped from Stern's
popular radio show.
</P>
<P>
   That makes the hourlong show's content similar to ``Howard
Stern,'' the 30-minute taped version of Stern's radio show that's
on the E! Entertainment cable channel six nights a week.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said the two TV shows would use separate material from the
radio broadcasts. He said he doesn't have time to do an originally
produced TV show as well as his daily radio program. Anyway, said
Stern, the radio show adapts well to the visual medium of
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about it,'' he said in his freewheeling on-air radio
press conference Tuesday. ``The radio show is really a television
show in a sense. We have people down here. We're running around the
studio. We have guests. It's not unlike `The Tonight Show' or
something like that in format. It's just that it's better.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It's not Stern's first excursion into broadcast television.
WWOR-TV, the Secaucus, N.J., superstation, originated the infamous
Saturday night ``Howard Stern Show'' in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   That show's high points included the use of real prostitutes in
``Hooker Howiewood Squares,'' homeless contestants vying for a
shopping cart on ``Homeless Howiewood Squares,'' and a guest star
who ate live worms.
</P>
<P>
   The period was also notable for Stern's radio attacks on WWOR
management, and for the quick cancellation of the show after a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Stern has had a successful movie and two best-selling books
since then, which adds up to a measure of media respectability.
</P>
<P>
   But he's not entirely domesticated. On the radio, he's been
speaking warmly about his relationship with his longtime backer,
Karmazin, and goading another CBS executive, CBS Television
President Leslie Moonves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be honest with you,'' Stern told a few million radio
listeners. ``Leslie is so embarrassed by me, he won't even come on
my (radio) show and promote the show with me hand-in-hand. You
don't see Leslie sitting here. Where is he? Think about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he goes, `Well, it's not a CBS show. While many CBS
stations are running it, it's not an official CBS show.' What's the
matter? You afraid to sit on the couch next to me, Leslie?''
</P>
<P>
   Moonves reports to Karmazin. Stern might be the barbarian at
CBS' gate, but he can pick his way through an organizational chart.

EDITORIAL: COLLAPSING LILCO PARACHUTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug. 20:
</P>
<P>
   Golden parachutes for executives are often exorbitant, but they
have a certain logic. By assuring a company's senior officials that
they will be richly compensated if they lose their jobs as a result
of a takeover, golden parachutes encourage them not to resist a
merger that might benefit shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   But those who defend such parachutes never contemplated that
they would be used as they were at LILCO, the old Long Island
Lighting Co. Executives there collected millions in parachute
payments, but they also kept their jobs when part of LILCO was
merged into the old Brooklyn Union Gas Co. to form Marketspan Corp.
The rest of LILCO went to the Long Island Power Authority, a state
agency.
</P>
<P>
   The payments created outrage among shareholders and resentment
among executives from the former Brooklyn Union Gas who were not
getting such payouts. Now the top management of Marketspan is
reported to be demanding that some of the executives either give
back the parachute money or bail out of the company.
</P>
<P>
   It is a reasonable request that executives who were not really
severed should give back their severance pay, particularly
considering that they would get to keep other payments they got
under the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this will do nothing about the biggest of the
payments, to former LILCO chairman William Catacosinos, who
collected $42 million, part of it as a golden parachute. Lawsuits
have been filed, by Suffolk County and the LIPA, contending that
those payments were illegal.
</P>
<P>
   But blocking them would have been easier if the state had made
them an issue when the deal was being negotiated.

ANGELS NOTES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Pitcher Ken Hill's rehab start for single-A
Lake Elsinore in Stockton on Tuesday gave the Anaheim Angels reason
for concern.
</P>
<P>
   Hill was supposed to make 90 pitches and then be activated for
Sunday's game against Toronto. But Hill felt discomfort in his
right elbow starting in the fourth inning and left after making
just 70 pitches in four-plus innings. Hill had arthroscopic elbow
surgery on June 15.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Angels manager Terry Collins called it a setback,
Hill would not. Hill, who had X-rays Wednesday that were negative,
blamed it on the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fine, he said. ``I know what it was. It was just a little
cold, cold weather. The temperature was like 65 degrees. ... I got
70 pitches in. I was supposed to go 90 to 95, that's the only
difference. Other than that, I got some good work in.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said he will throw on the side Friday and wouldn't rule out
pitching on Sunday. Collins, though, has already penciled Chuck
Finley's name into Sunday's starting slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pretty disappointed when we heard what happened,
Collins said. ``But at least Kenny was smart enough to know he had
to back off.
</P>
<P>
   Although team physician Dr. Lewis Yocum was expected to examine
Hill, Hill said he didn't anticipate any more doctor visits: ``For
what? I'm fine.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus was promoted from triple-A Vancouver on July 30 to
take Dave Hollins' spot at third base and is expected to stay there
for years to come. He's been steady in the field (only two errors),
but has been slow to come around at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Wednesday's game, Glaus was hitting .206 with one
homer and 10 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know everyone's been waiting for him to hit home runs,
Collins said. ``But he's played in only 80-some games of pro ball.
And all of a sudden, he's playing in a pennant race, playing
against the Yankees, Red Sox, everybody else. We have to realize
he's still young, and he's learning a new position.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus was a shortstop at UCLA when the Angels selected him in
the June 1997 draft with the No. 3 overall pick.
</P>
<P>
   Hollins underwent arthroscopic surgery Wednesday at the
Kerlan-Jobe Health Center in Los Angeles. Dr. Yocum performed the
surgery, which requires four to six months of rehabilitation. ...
Pitchers Jeff Juden and Allen Watson went to a hair salon in
Newport Beach Wednesday, and Juden came back a blonde. Watson only
had blonde highlights put in. ... Garret Anderson was not in the
starting lineup Wednesday to get a rest. Reggie Williams started in
his place and batted leadoff.

EDITORIAL: A SHORTSIGHTED TOBACCO DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug. 20:
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court ruling that the Food and Drug
Administration does not have authority to regulate tobacco or
prohibit tobacco sales to children inappropriately limits the power
of the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which reverses a federal district judge in North
Carolina, ignores the broad authority granted to the FDA to protect
the public from unsafe drugs and devices. A sensible reading of the
law would put tobacco within the agency's purview.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 the FDA declared that it would begin regulating tobacco
as a nicotine-delivery device, prohibit the sale of cigarettes to
minors and limit tobacco advertising. This was admittedly a change
in direction for the agency, which for many decades said it did not
have such authority.
</P>
<P>
   The two-member majority of the appeals court panel found this
long-held stance an indication that such authority had never been
granted by Congress. But that reasoning does not take into account
increasingly clear evidence that nicotine is an addictive drug.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is expected to appeal the new ruling to
the full 4th Circuit bench, and the issue will probably end up
before the Supreme Court. But Congress can resolve the legal battle
by explicitly granting the agency authority to regulate tobacco. It
goes against reason that the FDA should have no power to protect
children from the leading preventable cause of death in this
country.

EDITORIAL: PRAGUE SPRING REVISITED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug. 20:
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago Thursday night the Soviet Union and the Warsaw
Pact invaded Czechoslovakia. The invasion wiped out what the
government of Alexander Dubcek called ``socialism with a human
face,'' which had established a free press, some political rights
and intra-party democracy.
</P>
<P>
   A new book, ``The Prague Spring '68,'' helps answer the question
of why the Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia, as it had Hungary, while
it overlooked insubordination elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The book was compiled by a committee of scholars in the former
Czechoslovakia who combed their country's archives and with the
help of the National Security Archive, a nongovernmental group in
Washington, found documents from Soviet and other East Bloc files.
Most of the letters and transcripts of meetings and phone
conversations have not been published in English before.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow feared the Prague Spring could spread. The most rabid
proponents of invasion were from East Germany and Poland, not the
Kremlin. The heresy that seemed most to exercise Soviet leader
Leonid Brezhnev was the free press. In repeated conversations with
the mild Dubcek, Brezhnev complained of the newspapers' anti-Soviet
attacks. He continually urged Dubcek to surround himself with
``reliable'' party members.
</P>
<P>
   Dubcek finlly said in one phone conversation, ``if you believe
we are deceiving you, then you should take the measures that your
Politburo believes are necessary.'' In one of the great
understatements of the Cold War, Brezhnev replied, ``Sasha, I
understand that you're nervous.'' Some Russians argue that Dubcek's
line was an invitation, but it was far more likely spoken out of
exasperation.
</P>
<P>
   The documents reveal that Moscow may have worried about
protecting nuclear weapons it was planning to base in
Czechoslovakia or deploy there in an emergency. A draft of a
Czechoslovak report on military doctrine shows that officials were
considering rejecting nuclear weapons. Mark Kramer, a Harvard
expert on East Bloc archives, writes in the notes to the report
that it was leaked to Moscow shortly before the invasion.
</P>
<P>
   After the invasion, most Prague Spring officials became stokers
or night watchmen _ Dubcek wound up as a pipefitter in the forest
service _ and the whiff of freedom evaporated, to return to
Czechoslovakia only after 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The invasion, however, greatly diminished support for Moscow
among Western Communist parties, and the Prague Spring provided a
model for the reforms that came later. In 1987, Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev's spokesman, Gennadi Gerasimov, was asked the
difference between perestroika and the Prague Spring. ``Nineteen
years,'' he replied.

RARE NOTE OF IMPERFECTION CREEPS INTO YANKEES' SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Opposing players and managers maintain their
professional mien and say the New York Yankees are a good team but
nothing special, that beating them is nothing special. Then, when
they do conquer the Yankees for a day, as the Minnesota Twins did
Wednesday night, 5-3, they react as if they had won the Little
League World Series.
</P>
<P>
   For Minnesota manager Tom Kelly, a grin is an outburst of
emotion. But as the Twins thumped Andy Pettitte (14-7) for the
third time this year, they escaped a pivotal jam in the seventh and
Kelly hammered the air with his fists in the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The loss snapped the Yankees' three-game winning streak and left
them 92-31 for the season, which is something special in most
books.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were 1 for 13 with runners in scoring position
Wednesday night, and nothing underlined their frustration more than
the seventh inning. Trailing by 5-2, the Yankees loaded the bases
with nobody out and the rest seemed inevitable: Somebody would get
a hit, somebody else would hit a home run and the Yankees would win
again.
</P>
<P>
   But the Minnesota pitcher Mike Trombley briefly interrupted the
Yankees' fantasy season. He struck out Paul O'Neill, who slammed
and broke his bat after his whiff. Trombley then struck out Bernie
Williams. And after falling behind Tino Martinez three balls and no
strikes, Trombley came back to strike out Martinez on some anxious
swings, prompting Kelly's outburst.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees did not act or play like themselves in the early
innings. They were just off, like a train 10 minutes late, or a
delivery of a dozen roses that's one short. The Yankees loaded the
bases with nobody out in the second inning against Mike Morgan, the
Twins' starting pitcher, who was making only his second appearance
since June. Then Tim Raines hit into a double play; a run scored,
but the rally was over.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Girardi smacked a double to start the third, but when Chuck
Knoblauch singled to center, Girardi kept glancing over his
shoulder as he ran to third and assumed he would stop. All the
while, the third base coach Willie Randolph windmilled his arm and
waved for Girardi to round the bag. When the next three hitters
made out, Girardi was left at third base.
</P>
<P>
   There were more imperfections: Girardi nearly drilling Pettitte
with his warm-up throw to second base before the fourth inning,
O'Neill making outs in his first four at-bats and extending his
hitless streak to 12 at-bats. No one was more imperfect, however,
than Pettitte, who has been more about finger-painting lately among
a starting rotation of artists.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed eight hits and walked two, repeatedly falling behind
in the count against the Twins, who are among the American League's
worst teams but have given Pettitte major trouble this year.
Minnesota beat Pettitte on May 9, pounding him for nine hits and 7
runs in five and two-thirds innings, and then thrashed him again
six days later, with 12 hits and 7 runs over 7 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee left-hander struggled to finish off hitters Wednesday
night, to identify a pitch that would place the Twins on the
defensive. Early last month, when Pettitte was at his best, he
would slam his cut fastball in on the hands of opposing
right-handed batters, and once they tried to adjust to this inside
pitch, he would fire his two-seam fastball or his changeup low and
away and they would be completely at his mercy. He often used his
cut fastball against left-handed batters, running it away from them
like a slider.
</P>
<P>
   But a major league scout has noticed that Pettitte has not been
throwing his cut fastball as much as he did before straining a
muscle in his back in late July. Either that or the movement on
this pitch has been reduced dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   David Ortiz's at-bats against Pettitte in the second and third
innings Wednesday night were perfect examples of the Yankee
starter's inability to apply the coup de grace.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, a left-handed-hitting first baseman, got ahead in the
count three balls and one strike in the second, then swung at
strike two before fouling off two pitches and finally walking on a
curveball low and inside. It was an eight-pitch war with the type
of hitter Pettitte usually dominates.
</P>
<P>
   The next inning, Pettitte once again fell behind 3-1, trying
three times to get Ortiz to chase a breaking ball. Ortiz struck out
on the seventh pitch of the at-bat, but it was too hard, too much
effort for Pettitte.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees fell behind early after assuming a 1-0 advantage in
the second. The Twins mustered two runs in the bottom of the
inning, on a run-scoring groundout and Pat Meares' run-scoring
single, and never trailed.

YOSHII HANGS TOUGH, AND HIS SUMMER DROUGHT IS OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Masato Yoshii kept waiting for his drought to end and
kept wondering if it ever would. Yoshii was approaching three
months without winning in the major leagues, a startling stretch
considering he has remained in the rotation and the New York Mets
have remained in the skirmish for the wild-card berth.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Wednesday night, Yoshii stopped wondering and stopped
waiting as he guided the Mets to a 2-1 victory over the Colorado
Rockies and won for the first time in 15 starts. It was his first
triumph since May 27, when Mike Piazza was apparently enjoying his
first week with the Mets. And it enabled the Mets (69-55) to leap
ahead of the Chicago Cubs (69-57) by one game in the wild-card
race.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii pitched dependably into the eighth, Piazza smacked a
run-scoring single and was cheered for the second straight night
and Brian McRae's hustle helped the Mets win for the 10th time in
their last 13 games. Mostly, this was Yoshii's night. ``I'm really
proud of how he's endured,'' said manager Bobby Valentine. ``I
thought tonight was as good as he's been.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii (5-6) yielded a homer to Darryl Hamilton on the second
pitch of the game and then danced around the Rockies without being
damaged for another run for the next seven and two-thirds innings.
Even though he gave up nine hits, Yoshii was successful because he
limited the Rockies to no hits in six at-bats with runners in
scoring position while striking out six and walking one with a
powerful fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling that I had to win or need to win was a few levels
higher,'' Yoshii said. ``Maybe that raised the concentration level
to bring the pitching I had today.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mark McGwire, the major league's leading home run hitter
with 49, and the Cardinals invading Shea Stadium for doubleheaders
Thursday and Friday that are expected to attract more than 40,000
fans each night, the Mets improved to 3-0 in this busy week at
home.
</P>
<P>
   They did it with snazzy pitching, stellar relief from Dennis
Cook and John Franco and sturdy defense from shortstop Rey Ordonez,
who snagged a liner and started a crucial double play in the sixth
and robbed Kirt Manwaring of a certain hit with one of his sliding
plays in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Cook replaced Yoshii with Dante Bichette on third and two out in
the eighth and struck out the pinch-hitter Mike Lansing with a 1-2
fastball. Franco, knowing that he had mishandled leads that would
have given Yoshii a victory three different times, worked a 1-2-3
ninth for his 27th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yoshii finally got a win,'' Franco said. ``I've messed it up
for him before so I'm happy to see that. He did an outstanding job.
It's been since May. That's a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii had not won in his previous 14 starts, going 0-5 with a
5.03 earned run average and seemingly placing himself in a perilous
position if the six-man rotation was ever reduced to the customary
five-man rotation. While Yoshii had pitched seven innings or more
and allowed two earned runs or fewer in four different starts, he
had nevertheless not been winning.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine had dinner with Yoshii when the Mets were in Colorado
two weeks ago and told him that he still thought he was throwing
well and to not let the streak without a victory bother him. After
Hamilton lined an 0-1 pitch into the Met bullpen in right field in
the first, it looked like another disastrous night. But Yoshii
rebounded after the homer and retired nine of the next 10 batters.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii, who has two hits in 36 at-bats this season for an .056
average, looked as if he had won the lottery after Bobby Jones
inexplicably walked him to open the third.
</P>
<P>
   He raced to third on Tony Phillips' ground-rule double. After
Edgardo Alfonzo struck out and John Olerud walked to cram the
bases, Piazza received a partial standing ovation before he even
reached the batter's box. It was the second in two nights for
Piazza, who was also cheered after his three-run, pinch-hit double
that put the Mets ahead in the second game Tuesday night. This
time, Piazza did not empty the bases. But he lined a single to left
to drive in Yoshii and even the score, 1-1, and continued to hear
the cheers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question this is a big week for us with a lot of
games,'' Piazza said. ``I don't think there's any reason to put
pressure on ourselves. We have to play our game and keep doing what
we've been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   McRae's speed and Piazza's body helped score the winning run.
McRae tapped a ground ball to shortstop Neifi Perez, who flipped to
second base. But Piazza barreled into second baseman Kurt Abbot,
whose throw did not beat McRae to first for the double play as
Phillips crossed the plate to make it 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   It stayed that way. Yoshii finally won. ''Of course I'm happy to
get the win,'' Yoshii said. ``I'm more happy that we swept
Colorado.''

NO PLAYOFFS FOR LIBERTY THIS SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ With an opportunity to control its own
post-season destiny Wednesday night, the New York Liberty fell
asleep at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty had held a large lead near the end of the first half
against the Detroit Shock, but it stumbled, then never regained its
form in losing the most important game of the season, 82-68.
</P>
<P>
   A stunned Liberty team returned to its suburban hotel for a
late-night vigil. The Liberty needed help to get into the playoffs.
Washington had let the Liberty down by losing to the Charlotte
Sting, 105-69, so its only hope was with the lowly Sacramento
Monarchs, who were playing a powerful Mercury team in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty, led by Sophia Witherspoon's 26 points, had a chance
to turn around the game late when Rebecca Lobo scored a layup that
tied the score at 62-62. But the Liberty went ice cold, and didn't
score another field goal until less than a minute remained in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Shock, who was led by Sandy Brondello's 24 points, ended its
inaugural season with a 17-13 record. The Liberty, a year after
finishing as runner-up in the Women's National Basketball
Association, ended its regular season at 18-12.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty surrounding the Liberty's post-season chances
was evident in the locker room before the game. The usual
boisterous laughter and spirited conversations between players was
replaced by a quiet apprehension. The players sat alone in their
stalls, lacing up their sneakers, saying little, if anything, to
one another.
</P>
<P>
   But the Liberty went on an 8-0 run early in the first half, and
led by as many as 14 points. For much of the first 20 minutes, it
seemed the Liberty players could do no wrong. Behind-the-back
passes, off-balance shots, everything went the Liberty's way and
the ball eventually seemed to find the net.
</P>
<P>
   But a string of sloppy plays by the Liberty _ including two
straight giveaways, Elisabeth Cebrian dribbling off her foot, a
shot-clock violation and Sophia Witherspoon stepping on the
sideline on successive visits to the offensive end _ began to eat
at the Liberty's lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty, led by 11-point first-half efforts by Vickie
Johnson and Witherspoon, couldn't find its groove again. With three
minutes left in the half, the lead was down to 36-31. The Shock,
led by 39-year-old Lynette Woodard's 12 first-half points, ripped
off 7 straight points to end the half leading by 38-36.

PETITION FOR L.A. SECESSION STUDY WINS EXTENSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The state Senate unanimously approved a bill that
would give San Fernando Valley activists three more months to
circulate petitions calling for a secession study.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, written late last week by Assemblyman Robert
Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, passed 37-0 in the Senate and now goes to
the state Assembly, where it could face a vote as soon as Monday. A
two-thirds vote of approval would send the measure to Gov. Pete
Wilson to sign or reject. If signed, it would take effect
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly elated with the Senate vote today,'' said Jeff
Brain, president of Valley Voters Organized Toward Empowerment.
``We anticipate the Assembly will be smooth sailing.''
</P>
<P>
   Valley VOTE is gathering petitions in hopes of triggering a
government study of whether the Valley could form its own city
without causing financial damage to the rest of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Based on their interpretation of state law, Valley VOTE leaders
believe they have just seven days left to finish collecting the
135,000 valid signatures needed to launch the proposed study. As of
Tuesday, the group had 116,900 names.
</P>
<P>
   In its editorial pages, the Daily News has strongly endorsed
Valley VOTE's drive to trigger a public study of secession that
would determine whether the breakup would be revenue-neutral to the
remaining part of the city and whether the new city would be
economically viable. The newspaper has contributed $60,000 to the
petition-gathering effort.
</P>
<P>
   Should the bill become law before the petition drive's current
deadline of Aug. 27, Valley VOTE would continue collecting
signatures until leaders felt they had enough for a comfortable
margin of success, Brain said. The group estimates it needs about
180,000 signatures to make sure at least 135,000 prove to be valid.
</P>
<P>
   If the bill becomes law after the deadline, Valley VOTE members
said, they will tally their petitions and decide then whether to
restart the drive for signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tight timing, Valley VOTE leaders said they are
cautiously optimistic that the bill could become law before they
hit their deadline next week. Backed by several local lawmakers,
the bill already has received unanimous votes in both the full
Senate and a Senate committee in the first three days of this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a new record for legislation,'' Hertzberg said
after the Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   Hertzberg and Valley VOTE members attributed the bill's swift
movement to the coalition of supportive lawmakers. Backers built
that coalition by pitching the bill as a way to make up for the
blow dealt to the petition drive when Los Angeles city employees
ejected Valley VOTE volunteers from a popular air show at which
they hoped to gather at least 20,000 signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Even secession foe Sen. Richard Polanco, D-Los Angeles, signed
on as a principal co-author of the bill, citing the air show as a
reason. Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles, is
listed as a joint author.
</P>
<P>
   ``That, together with our other coalitions we've put together,
will enhance our chance of passing (in the Assembly),'' Hertzberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   The exact path of the bill is not certain. It could still face a
hearing -- and possibly revision -- in the Assembly local
government committee before reaching the Assembly floor, a step
that could delay it a day, said Hertzberg spokesman Paul Hefner.
</P>
<P>
   Hertzberg will push to have the bill go straight to the Assembly
floor instead, Hefner said.
</P>
<P>
   The assemblyman said he did not anticipate that Wilson would
reject the bill if it reaches his desk.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Sean Walsh said Wilson had not had a chance to review
the language of the bill, but is a strong supporter of
self-determination for the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Legislature considers changing the petition drive's
deadline, Valley VOTE also has suggested that the target number of
signatures needed might change.
</P>
<P>
   The group must collect the signatures of 25 percent of all
registered voters within the Los Angeles city portion of the
Valley. But after noting numerous mistakes on the county's list of
voters, the group's executive board decided Wednesday to contact
Los Angeles County officials and determine exactly how many voters
live in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Valley VOTE estimates there are 526,000 voters registered in the
Valley, a number the group derived by taking the entire list of Los
Angeles voters and adding up those with Valley ZIP codes. Neither
Los Angeles city nor county election officials reached Wednesday
said they knew the exact count of registered Valley voters.

NEW KIDS GET YEARLY DOSE OF TEASING FROM ASU VETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP TONTOZONA _ Freshmen, beware.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get one of the kids and tape him to his bed and put
him out on the 50-yard line butt-naked,'' offensive lineman Grey
Ruegamer said. ``Put honey all over him so the bees and bears and
pigs are out there, loving it.''
</P>
<P>
   Camp Tontozona, it's a beautiful thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona State football team's annual retreat is an intense
10 days of conditioning and drills in preparation for the season.
But for newcomers, contending with off-the-field follies is nearly
as challenging.
</P>
<P>
   (Aside to freshman defensive lineman Mike Pinkard: That sandal
you were looking for all day yesterday? It's on top of the exit
sign in the freshmen trailer.)
</P>
<P>
   If you are a Sun Devils newcomer, you can count on two things:
You will be victimized by numerous practical jokes; and your living
conditions _ despite the panoramic surroundings _ will be less than
glamorous.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean?'' Coach Bruce Snyder asked. ``It's the
Hilton.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh huh. Twenty-five freshmen share a trailer right next to the
football field. Bunk beds take up most of the space, and dirty
clothes are scattered throughout. The smell, well, pick up a gas
mask at the door.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on entering at night. This season's group has
barricaded the entrance by jamming a bunk bed against the door. The
windows are wired shut with coat hangers. It gets a little warm in
there _ the veterans already have disrupted the circuit breaker so
the air-conditioner doesn't work _ but it's worth the trade-off to
fend off a possible late-night seniors raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are brooms and sticks laying around,'' said Darrel
Turner, a fullback from Bellflower, Calif. ``In case they come in,
we'll hear them trip.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The place,'' Brandon Falkner said, ``is a fortress.''
</P>
<P>
   Falkner, a defensive back from Peoria High School, has reason to
be paranoid. He already has been hit in the head by water balloons
thrown from the seniors' cabin that sits on a hill above.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water balloons?'' senior Albrey Battle asked innocently. ``I
don't know nothing about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Falkner, like most of the freshmen, has had his clothes and
towels taken from the outdoor showers. Often, he's been forced to
run naked around the field to find them.
</P>
<P>
   There are full moons at all hours at Camp Tontozona.
</P>
<P>
   The antics have been tamer than last year, when the freshmen
``were a bit more cocky,'' Ruegamer said.
</P>
<P>
   That group got dead fish in its air-conditioning unit. Even the
local wildlife was offended.
</P>
<P>
   Ruegamer admits he's enjoying his senior status. He was the
victim of numerous practical jokes as a freshman, including Tabasco
sauce in his dinner and leftovers in his bed.
</P>
<P>
   Such follies are nothing new. Since 1959, when Coach Frank Kush
brought his team to this remote site that borders the Tonto
National Forest, the newcomers have been tormented.
</P>
<P>
   Former quarterback Jeff Van Raaphorst and several teammates
donned hoods, broke into the freshmen sleeping quarters and threw
several players into a nearby pond.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Jake Plummer and Juan Roque tossed a bat _ as
in the flying creature _ into the trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder doesn't mind the mild antics but insists that his players
don't get carried away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a specific policy, but I tell them, `Don't ever
treat your teammate really lousy, or with distaste,' '' he said.
``You don't take someone physically and do something. Never, in 35
years, have I seen how that has helped team morale.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the bark is worse than the bite. Several times over
the past week, veterans have been overheard warning freshmen, ``You
better watch your back. This could be the night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just like to mess with them, give them something to think
about,'' Battle said. ``They don't really know. They're 17-,
18-year-old kids coming here. For some, it's their first time being
away from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of fun to tease them a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruegamer already has walked through the freshmen trailer and
looked around, just to make them sweat a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   No one escapes dinner entertainment, when newcomers must sing
the ASU fight song and read their team bio aloud. When accolades
are mentioned _ ``John made the all-academic team'' _ a sarcastic
``oooohhh, aaahhhh'' follows.
</P>
<P>
   And as uncomfortable as the living conditions can be sometimes,
the freshmen admit they enjoy the bonding experience.
</P>
<P>
   This season's group spends its late-night hours recounting the
evening's meetings with position coaches, who often single out
freshmen for rookie mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the funniest newcomers, whose identity will remain
anonymous, does a dead-on impression of running backs coach Cornell
Jackson, who likes to say, ``If you don't KNOW, then you don't
GO!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hilarious,'' another anonymous freshman said.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of the newcomers experience, said Snyder, who
believes the trailer is a symbol for introduction to the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says, `As you work your way through the program, things do
get better: playing time, along with other things,' '' Snyder said.
``When you're a freshman, that's just where you are on the
ladder.'' &QL;

HOFFMAN FACING TROUBLED TIMES
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ You look at Glenn Hoffman's face and don't have to
ask who won or lost. Two months after Hoffman took over for Bill
Russell as Dodgers manager, the season has slipped away and so has
his smile.
</P>
<P>
   This was his summer to show he belonged in the big leagues, that
he was more than some minor-league bureaucrat with good people
skills and a knack for detail.
</P>
<P>
   He just never thought it would come to this, a 6-5 loss
Wednesday night in front of 27,259 at Three Rivers Stadium that
completed a two-game sweep by the lowly Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman never expected to be eight games back in the wild-card
race with 36 to play. Or to lose 10 of the last 13, mostly to teams
worse than his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at him in the dugout and I can see he is depressed,''
right fielder Gary Sheffield said. ``He brought a lot of energy
here, but we didn't do the job for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else around the Dodgers, Hoffman's future will be
decided this winter when the new owners at Fox decide the extent of
the purge. Hoffman's work ethic has won him supporters, but the
team remains a mess. He is expected to be reassigned at the end of
the year and given a top position in the farm system.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens after the season honestly is not my concern,''
said Hoffman, whose honesty was one of the traits that earned him a
promotion from manager at Triple-A Albuquerque. ``I take what is
happening personally. But there are five weeks and I truly think we
can turn it around.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Hoffman, 40, looked like the only one who still
believed.
</P>
<P>
   Like Tuesday's loss, the Dodgers jumped out to an early lead,
then let the Pirates' youngsters run away with the game.
</P>
<P>
   This time the Dodgers took a 3-0 lead in the second against
Pittsburgh starter Todd Van Poppel. But a throwing error by Dodgers
left-hander Brian Bohanon (6-8) in the third led to two runs and a
fifth-inning, two-run homer by journeyman Manny Martinez gave the
Pirates a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can live with the home runs,'' said Bohanon, who could lose
his starting spot when Ismael Valdes returns to the rotation
sometime next week. ``But the mental mistakes are what bother me. I
have to make that throw. I feel I cost this team a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   He had help.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Dodgers retook the lead in the sixth when
Bohanon had an RBI triple over the head of a stunned Martinez in
center, Pittsburgh came right back.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon faced the first two batters in the seventh and both
reached based. He was replaced by Antonio Osuna. Osuna's first
batter, Tony Womack bunted up the third-base line.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, who had a strong game at the plate (2 for 4), picked up
the ball, but his throw eluded Eric Young covering first. Lou
Collier scored to tie the game at five and Martinez followed with a
game-winning sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the team heads onto Florida to play the Marlins, who took
two of three from the Dodgers last week in Los Angeles. Hoffman
said then it couldn't get worse, but it has.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember my first full year managing with the Cubs (1981),''
said third- base coach Joey Amalfitano. ``After winning the first
game we lost the next 11. It was a helpless feeling. That was the
strike year and things got better in the second half, but it was a
difficult time. This has to be a difficult time for Glenn.''
</P>
<P>
   Amalfitano was fired after that season.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a manager, Tom Lasorda used to say all that mattered
in his job was winning. Lasorda, now the interim general manager,
appears ready to slip into a consulting role after the season. But
he feels for Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   When Lasorda went to spring training last February with only
minor-league duties, Hoffman and vice president Ralph Avila were
among the few who sought his advice. The two remain close, but
there is little Lasorda can do now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's down, you can see that,'' Lasorda said. ``But the manager
can only do so much. It's the players who are on the field. What
Glenn has done is make the players more proud about the name on the
front of the uniform instead of the back. That is important.''

Bell rings down curtain on Phils
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PHILADELPHIA _ Astros manager Larry Dierker must have known
something prior to Wednesday night's game when he said it was only
a matter of time before Derek Bell started producing at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's usually somewhere between three to five days where he
looks like he's all out of whack, and then he just keeps coming
back and getting hot again,'' Dierker said of Bell, who entered the
series finale with the Philadelphia Phillies hitless in his last 14
at-bats. ``If that trend continues, he's about to get hot again.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine innings later, Dierker must have felt like a genius. Then
again, with all the comebacks the Astros have staged this season,
he just has to sit back and watch.
</P>
<P>
   Bell delivered a two-run, bases-loaded single with two out in
the ninth inning as the Astros rallied for a 4-3 victory over the
Phillies before a stunned crowd of 21,341 at Veterans Stadium. It
marked the 22nd time this season the Astros have pulled out a
victory in their final at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, whose average had slipped to a season-low .308 during the
past week before he came up with a fourth-inning single Wednesday,
said he wasn't thinking about his recent slump. Before his final
at-bat, Bell was hitting .194 this month with nine RBIs in 17
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't matter,'' said Bell, who is batting .478
(11-for-23) against Phillies closer Mark Leiter in his career. ``I
just like being in the thick and thin of things and try to help the
team win. All I have to do is be patient, concentrate and not worry
about hitting the ball out of the ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Astros down 3-2 heading into the ninth, pinch hitters
Dave Clark and Richard Hidalgo singled off Leiter (6-4) to put
runners at first and third with one out. Craig Biggio flied out to
right field, but pinch runner Ricky Gutierrez was forced to hold up
on Bob Abreu's throw to the plate. Leiter hit Bill Spiers on the
left elbow to load the bases, and Bell hit a 3-and-2 fastball up
the middle for the Astros' 38th come-from-behind win this season.
The victory increased their lead in the National League Central to
8{ games over the Chicago Cubs and pulled them within 3{ games of
San Diego for the NL's second-best record.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't look like he was swinging too good until that last
at-bat,'' Dierker said of Bell. ``I know a guy when he's swinging
good wants to be the guy up there when the game is on the line. But
a guy that is struggling probably would just as soon see somebody
else get the hit. There was no choice, and he really had a great
at-bat. He managed to be patient enough to get the hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Said first baseman Jeff Bagwell: ``He's been a great hitter for
us all year. He's had a great attitude and approach to hitting. It
was just a matter of time for him to get a hit. Luckily for us, it
showed up at a great time.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Wagner pitched the ninth inning, notching his 24th save in
26 opportunities. After allowing singles to Rico Brogna and Abreu,
Wagner got Bobby Estalella on a called third strike to end the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Astros righthander Shane Reynolds (15-8) took a two-hitter into
the seventh inning before the Phillies took the lead on a three-run
homer by Abreu, a former Astro who was left unprotected in the
expansion draft and was picked by Tampa Bay before being traded to
Philadelphia. It was Abreu's 11th home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds allowed five hits and three runs, struck out nine and
walked one for his third victory in his last four decisions. At one
point, Reynolds retired 13 straight batters until Doug Glanville
beat out a high-bouncing infield hit to third base in the sixth
inning. Reynolds is 6-1 with a 2.83 ERA lifetime against the
Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker said Reynolds' performance, which pulled him within one
victory of his career-high 16 of 1996, was the best the righthander
has thrown this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as good as he's pitched all year,'' Dierker said. ``He
made one bad pitch (to Abreu). I looked up in the ninth, and we had
10 hits, and they had five; they had three runs, and we had two.
One big blow is sometimes the difference in the game. Luckily for
us, we were tenacious enough to get the win anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros took a 1-0 lead in the fifth when Biggio hit a
two-out double down the right-field line, scoring Tony Eusebio. The
Astros had another chance to score in the inning but failed when
Biggio was gunned down at the plate by Abreu on Spiers' single to
right. Abreu's assist was his 15th of the season, tops among
major-league outfielders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby's a great player,'' Bagwell said of his former teammate.
``At the time, he didn't fit into our plans right away. Luckily for
Bobby, he got an opportunity to play over here. He's shown that
he's a great player. He has a great arm, and we wish him all the
best in the world. I'm just glad his three-run homer wasn't the
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou put the Astros ahead 2-0 in the sixth with a solo
home run to right-center field, giving him 36 on the season. The
victim this time was Philadelphia starter Carlton Loewer, who
allowed eight hits and walked two in 7 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Alou, who has easily shattered his previous career high of 23
home runs set with the Florida Marlins last season, has hit 11 of
this year's homers on the first pitch. He also has 16 home runs
since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the Astros take seven of nine meetings between
the teams this season, Philadelphia manager Terry Francona said the
Astros' postseason possibilities are endless.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way you win pennants,'' Francona said. ``That's a
good team over there, and they think they're going deep into the
postseason. I can't argue with them.''

RANGERS STOP INDIANS, 3-1
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers' Aaron Sele represented the
American League during the 1998 All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the 28-year-old right-hander took the mound last night at
The Ballpark in Arlington with a 1-5 record and 7.02 earned-run
average since that selection.
</P>
<P>
   Sele, though, shoveled dirt on his struggles of July and August
by burying the Indians for eight innings in the Rangers' 3-1
victory against the Central Division-leading Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Sele surrendered only one run on five hits and one walk in a
101-pitch appearance Rangers manager Johnny Oates described as
being ``as well as he's pitched all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Rangers began this eight-game home stand by
terminating their three-game losing streak and are 11/2 games
behind the AL West-leading Anaheim Angels, who defeated the Detroit
Tigers last night.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' offense consisted of a three-run sixth inning in
which catcher Ivan Rodriguez delivered a run-scoring infield single
before third baseman Todd Zeile and designated hitter Mike Simms
drew consecutive bases-loaded walks from right-hander Charles Nagy
(10-9).
</P>
<P>
   That would be all Sele would need to record his single-season
best 14th victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story was Aaron Sele,'' Oates said. ``I thought he was in
command the entire ballgame, even in the inning when they scored
their run. That's as well as he's pitched all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Sele (14-10) pitched well in New York during Friday's 6-4 loss
to the Yankees, but the results did not match the performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at times he's pitched better than his numbers,'' Oates
said. ``I think he's pitched better than 1-5. I think he's pitched
better than some guys who are 5-2 since the All-Star break.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians departed for their hotel with no argument.
</P>
<P>
   Sele threw first-pitch strikes to 17 of 28 batters and induced
12 outs via the ground ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``That indicated that I was throwing the ball better,'' said
Sele, who recorded only his third victory this season when the
Rangers scored five or fewer runs. ``I'm a ground-ball pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagy, who entered the game leading the league with 31 home runs
surrendered, matched Sele early as he cruised through the Rangers'
lineup for five innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' offense consisted of an infield single by shortstop
Royce Clayton and a bunt single from second baseman Luis Alicea in
the third inning. Nagy also issued a first-inning walk to left
fielder Rusty Greer and another to Zeile in the second inning, but
no runner advanced as far as third base.
</P>
<P>
   That changed in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Alicea greeted Nagy with a leadoff single and advanced to third
on the ensuing double to center field by Greer. That brought right
fielder Juan Gonzalez to the plate with no outs, but his well-hit
ground ball found an infielder.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Travis Fryman kept the runners from advancing and
retired Gonzalez. Indians manager Mike Hargrove then opted to walk
first baseman Will Clark intentionally to load the bases and set up
a potential inning-ending, double-play ground ball.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez complied with a well-hit one-hopper that Fryman
prevented from leaving the infield with a diving stop, but he
juggled the ball as he returned to his feet and Rodriguez had an
infield single. Nagy then issued consecutive run-scoring walks to
Zeile and Simms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really didn't hit too many balls hard until Luis got the
base hit and Rusty hit the double,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Sele made the three-run inning stand with the scoreless ninth
inning provided from closer John Wetteland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to maintain my work ethic,'' Sele said. ``That's
how you keep your focus. There are a lot of peaks and valleys in
this game. You never try to get too high when things are going
well, and you don't want to get too low when things aren't going as
well.''

PREPS GET THE SCOOP ON INTERNET

 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ There's no problem finding high school
football recruiting information on the Internet. However, believing
everything you read is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   But the point is, if you want to read about recruiting, log on.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Bernard Riley, Los Alamitos' highly-recruited defensive
lineman.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom goes through the Web sites every day,'' said the
6-foot-2, 300-pound Riley. ``She'll have packets of stuff for me to
read. It helps me keep up on my top (seven) schools.''
</P>
<P>
   When in need of depth chart or roster, he can check out a
school's official site. And he can head to online newspaper sites
to find out what's going on in training camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids have the ability to know everything about us,'' one
Pac-10 recruiting coordinator said.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan Howry,
</P>
<P>
   Riley's Los Alamitos teammate, is another guy who gets
information on-line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at the incoming freshmen and what recruits each
school is looking at,'' Howry said. ``You can also find out what
classes are offered and more about the school. It's helped me.''
</P>
<P>
   Howry, a 5-foot-10, 155-pounder, said that Oregon, Washington
State, Washington, Arizona State and UCLA are his favorites right
now. And Arizona State is the leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona State loses four receivers,'' Howry said. ``That would
be a good place to go for a receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley, who is California's top defensive line prospect, said
USC, UCLA, Michigan, Florida State, Notre Dame, Arizona State and
Washington still have a shot. And Florida State's recent history of
turning out NFL first-round defensive linemen may not have an
effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could easily say no to anybody on my list,'' Riley said.
``Football is only one thing (to consider). Academics are important
and what kids do off the field. I don't see it happening, but it is
easy sometime to get caught up in bad stuff. If I (go on a visit)
and don't like it, I would have no problem saying no.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears that Arizona linemen Nick Johnson
</P>
<P>
   has dropped UCLA from his list of five. The 6-foot-8, 300-pound
Johnson has added Notre Dame to a list of prospective suitors which
includes Ohio State, Arizona State, Nebraska and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most interesting runs of a recent USC practice was
head coach Paul Hackett's
</P>
<P>
   rush across the field to say good-bye to Hart receiver Jerry
Owens.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3, 180-pound Owens was headed home after watching the
Trojans' morning practice at UC Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, along with Hart quarterback Kyle Boller
</P>
<P>
   (6-4, 200) and linebacker Scott Hunt
</P>
<P>
   (6-2, 220), also watched the Trojans scrimmage on Wednesday at
the L.A. Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hart head coach Mike Herrington,
</P>
<P>
   Owens has trimmed his wish list to about 10 schools, including
UCLA, USC, Washington, Arizona and Arizona State. UCLA is thought
to be the clear leader.
</P>
<P>
   Washington State's early commitment list grew to four last week
with verbals from a high school receiver and a pair of junior
college players. Culver City receiver Curtis Nettles
</P>
<P>
   (5-7, 170), Sierra College defensive linemen Eric Hodges
</P>
<P>
   (6-3, 248) and Citrus College defensive back Dante Minners
</P>
<P>
   (5-10, 180) are each headed to Pullman. The Cougars' first
commitment was La Canada St. Francis quarterback-defensive back
Kjell Nesen
</P>
<P>
   (6-2, 193).
</P>
<P>
   Oxnard tight end Jacob Rogers has been a frequent visitor to USC
practice over the past 10 days. Rogers, a 6-foot-5, 245-pound tight
end from Oxnard, has already given an oral commitment to the
Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   USC would love for 6-foot-5, 235-pound tight end Mike Seidman of
Westlake to line up on the other end from Rogers. Seidman's father
is a USC graduate, but the Trojans will have to battle UCLA,
Colorado and Washington for his services.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan linebacker T.J. Duckett, who some proclaim is the
country's best defender, has shown some interest in UCLA. The
6-foot-3, 240-pound Kalamazoo prep will choose among the Bruins,
Michigan, Michigan State, Ohio State and Florida State. His
brother, Tico, is a former standout at Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   Another pair of out-of-state guys reportedly looking at UCLA are
Blue Springs, Mo. teammates Jamar Mozee and John Garrison.
</P>
<P>
   Mozee (6-1, 205) is a running back and Garrison (6-6, 250) a
defensive lineman on one of the top prep teams in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Carter defensive back Monti Collier (6-0, 172) became
Mack Brown's 13th early commitment at Texas. Collier is the first
Carter High player to commit, but won't be the last.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College received a commitment from running back Greg Toal
</P>
<P>
   (5-11, 200) of Franklin Lakes, N.J. Toal, who rushed for 2,002
yards and 31 touchdowns last year, is the high school teammate of
Chris Simms, the country's best prep quarterback.

L.A. POLICE CHIEF HAILS STRIDES MADE SINCE RODNEY KING BEATING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Seven years after the Rodney King beating exposed
a wide range of deficiencies in the LAPD, Chief Bernard C. Parks
declared that the department has succeeded in implementing most
Christopher Commission recommendations and changing the culture of
law enforcement in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   From the inner city to the western San Fernando Valley,
community groups lauded the transformation of the Los Angeles
Police Department and acknowledged that there is a new attitude
among officers that represents a commitment to community policing.
</P>
<P>
   In the first report ever made on the steps taken by the LAPD to
comply with the Christopher Commission goals outlined in 1991 after
the King beating, Parks said the department has met 82 of the 102
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report signifies a milestone not just for the Los Angeles
Police Department, but for the people of this city,'' Parks said at
a special Police Commission meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Christopher) Commission's real message was that the
department needed to change its culture dramatically from one which
provided aloof and removed service to one which operated in true
partnership with the people it serves. As we look to the future, we
will never slip back into the isolationist way of dealing with
community problems at the operating level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The men and women of this department would not abandon the
partnerships they have forged. The Police Commission would never
allow it. The City Council and mayor would not allow it and, most
importantly, the public would not stand for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The report comes one year after Parks took over as chief, and
police commissioners credited him with renewing the department's
commitment to reform.
</P>
<P>
   While members of the commission headed by former Secretary of
State Warren Christopher declined direct comment, the Parks report
drew praise from three leading civil rights leaders in the city who
see a change in attitude by police officers.
</P>
<P>
   John Mack of the Urban League, Joe Hicks of the city Human
Relations Commission and Geraldine Washington of the Los Angeles
Chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People said they had seen a dramatic change in police relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You no longer see officers pulling over a teen-ager and
assuming they're a gangbanger,'' Mack said. ``We have had many
battles down here. Over Eulia Love. Over Rodney King. But many
things have changed here, a true change in the institution of the
LAPD.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks agreed and credited Parks for the change. ``Reform of any
any kind takes time, but we are beginning to see the payoff,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Huber of the West Valley Citizens Police Advisory Board
offered her own example of the change in the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think the West Valley is `Leave It to Beaver'
land,'' she said. ``That's not so. We have a lot of new immigrants
living here and they are afraid of the police, so it means a lot to
them when they see a police officer smile and wave at them. That's
the biggest change. Officers smile at people now.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks said it was an example of how the department had changed
to become part of the community. ``We want to provide friendly
service,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the American Civil Liberties Union said they
would not comment on the report until they have had additional time
to study it.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher and Gilbert Ray, the two top officials on the
independent commission appointed in the aftermath of the King
beating, said they would not comment directly on the LAPD's status
in adopting its recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone ever expected to see these adopted 100
percent,'' Ray said. ``Besides, issues change and you have to deal
with new circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrick Bobb, who had issued a critical report in 1996 on the
department's slowness in implementing reform, said he was pleased
the LAPD was tracking its progress. However, as a consultant to the
Police Commission, Bobb said he would not comment publicly on the
report.
</P>
<P>
   The major changes made by the department over the years since
the King incident have been a greater emphasis on community
policing as well as radical changes in the department's
use-of-force policy, in tracking problem officers, in dealing with
racism and bias within the department, in improving training, and
in broader recruitment of minorities and gays.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the structure of the department has changed, with the
chief of police limited to two five-year terms, the hiring of an
inspector general and greater authority given to the Police
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Christopher Commission recommendations not implemented,
Parks said all are being pursued and each has a high priority. Two
of the recommendations, however, would require City Charter changes
and are being held off until two charter reform panels complete
their work.
</P>
<P>
   Others involve issues that are under review, such as having
limited tours of duties for officers, and the roles of supervisors
and performance evaluations; or require more money, such as having
in-car video equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Police commissioners were effusive in their praise of Parks and
the progress made over the past two years in implementing reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Police Department you see today is a very different
department than was examined in 1991,'' said commission President
Edith Perez. ``It is a department whose makeup is representative of
the community, a department that is responsible to all the
communities of Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Commission Vice President Warren Jackson said he was pleased
particularly with the public's response to the changes in the
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what we have heard in the community, it is clear that the
Los Angeles Police Department has regained the public's
confidence,'' Jackson said.

TROJANS HAVE FORMIDABLE FOURSOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The collective egos of the USC receivers,
according to Trojan receiver coach Mike Wilson, must be checked at
the door.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no time to count receptions and it doesn't matter
who scores the touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys know they can't worry about how what they do as
individuals,'' said Wilson, who played on four Super Bowl
championship teams in San Francisco. ``That will work itself out.
Last year, we had three guys with at least 30 catches, which shows
it can be spread around.''
</P>
<P>
   All three of those guys seniors Billy Miller and Mike
Bastianelli and junior R. Jay Soward are back with the Trojans. Add
to the mix senior Larry Parker, who redshirted last season with
foot problems, and San Jose State transfer Windrell Hayes, and the
Trojans should have plenty of guys to catch the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the potential to be one of the best in the country,''
Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Potential, though, is a fickle thing.
</P>
<P>
   Parker's foot is healed, but he has missed a lot of practice
time with a touchy hamstring. Bastianelli appears healthy after
cracking his collarbone in the spring. Soward is sitting out the
opener against Purdue because of some academic deficiencies in the
spring. And Hayes is playing for the first time in more than a
year. Then there's Miller, who had trouble holding on to the ball
as a sophomore, was solid as a junior and has been sensational in
the first 10 days of practice.
</P>
<P>
   After that, though, there is a significant drop in skill level.
Rod Perry was expected to be a key backup, but the former Mater Dei
star, who missed his freshman season after his second knee surgery,
decided to quit football and transferred to Cal State Fullerton to
play baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomores Troy Garner and Stanley Guyness have yet to catch a
collegiate pass and have each been inconsistent in practice. The
other healthy receivers are walk-ons.
</P>
<P>
   But, unless injuries strike, the Trojans won't spend much time
going past five deep. And those five are pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps me as a defensive back,'' senior safety Rashard Cook
said. ``Once we get to the game, I'm not facing anybody better than
these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the group could very well be the different
strengths of the individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The balance and diversity of this group is something,'' Wilson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Soward, one of college football's big-play makers, represents
pure speed. The 5-foot-11, 175-pounder has scored 18 career
touchdowns in 107 touches, which is six points once in every six
times he gets the ball. His touchdowns are from an average of 53
yards, three are longer than 90 yards, and 14 have covered at least
40 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to leave the game and be like, `Ooh, did you see
what he did?''' said Soward, who has 66 career catches.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's 92-play scrimmage, Soward caught five passes for
133 yards, including a 47-yard toss from Mike Van Raaphorst. But,
he also dropped a sure touchdown on a perfectly placed bomb from
Carson Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``R. Jay made a couple of great plays,'' USC coach Paul Hackett
said. ``But there (also) was his Achilles' heel. One drop could
cost us a game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans' physical receiver is the 6-foot-4, 220-pound
Miller, who has jostled his way to 76 receptions in three years,
including a team-high 56 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy has been Billy,'' Wilson said. ``He's just such a solid
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   He was far from solid two years ago, when he had trouble
catching the ball. Miller has made those days feel like a long time
ago with his recent play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball feels comfortable in my hands,'' Miller said. ``(As a
sophomore) it used to ricochet off of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bastianelli, a 6-foot-1, 195-pound senior, who never lost a game
while playing at Concord De La Salle, is a fearless possession
receiver. His only catch as a freshman was a 15-yarder on
third-and-12 to keep a scoring drive alive in a win over Washington
State, and he has 58 career grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, a 6-foot-2, 200-pound senior, is a combination
size-and-speed guy. He played in all 11 games as a true freshman
and started all 12 games and caught 25 passes for the 1995 Rose
Bowl champions. Hamstring and heel problems hampered his junior
year and he redshirted last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be sure Larry is 100percent,'' Hackett said.
``Right now, he's not up to the rigors of two-a-day practices.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Hayes fits in is yet to be determined. Hayes showed up
four days into the training camp after pleading guilty to a
misdemeanor charge of writing checks with insufficient funds. He
was facing three felony charges for writing bad checks, but a
plea-bargain agreement allowed Hayes to receive three years
probation after paying restitution of nearly $8,500.
</P>
<P>
   The stocky 6-foot, 200-pound Hayes caught 97 passes for 1,383
yards in his two seasons at San Jose State, including four for 40
yards in a 1995 loss to USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``He a young man who's caught (nearly) 100 balls in college,''
Wilson said. ``We're dealing with a polished receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   Bastianelli and Miller played with Hayes in the 1995 Shrine
All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I heard he was coming here I told everybody this
guy is awesome,'' Bastianelli said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No telling how good we can be with him with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, only time will tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to jump ahead, but I think we'll be pretty damn
good.''

   Camp Tontozona &QL; 
Dear Mom &AMP; Dad:
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's almost over. Camp ends Saturday, and I can't begin to
tell you what a unique summer ex perience this has been.
</P>
<P>
   Swimming. Horseback riding. Canoeing. We haven't done any of
those.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Snyder, the camp coun selor, told freshmen the first night
that if any of us thought we were going to spend the next 10 days
making beaded necklaces and sing ing ``Kum-bah-ya'' around the camp
fire, we read the wrong brochure.
</P>
<P>
   Coach meant business. He was dressed like Tom Hanks in ``Saving
Private Ryan.'' This was boot camp, he barked, his steely eyes
fixed on each of us. He said if we weren't willing to make the
commitment and lay everything on the line for the glory of Arizona
State football, then we should leave camp right now, although Coach
didn't offer his car keys or a map.
</P>
<P>
   Two days ago a walk-on went AWOL. He finally cracked. Maybe it
was the 6:30 a.m. air-horn blasts. Or the practice-field voice of
Coach Cozzetto, our offensive coordinator, demanding that our
linemen _ ``Lemme HEAR you!!'' _ not only block but growl.
</P>
<P>
   After lights out, there were 24 of us in our bunk beds in the
freshman trailer. Next morning, there were 23.
</P>
<P>
   When last seen, the deserter had gone over the hill and was
standing by the highway next to the yellow ``Watch For Animals Next
25 Miles'' sign, his thumb out.
</P>
<P>
   The guy might be home by now.
</P>
<P>
   I'm (sigh) still here. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Day 8 and counting &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the marks on the wall, this is Day 8. Seems like no
more than a month ago we left cam pus and bused 100 miles to camp.
During the ride up, I went over the checklist of items players were
urged to pack to make our stay more enjoyable. A fan. A pillow. A
``better'' blanket. Shampoo. Ear plugs.
</P>
<P>
   Our team motto is ``One at a Time.'' One at a time is how fresh
men use the camp outdoor toilet, property of ``Little Stinker Tink
lers.''
</P>
<P>
   We enjoy several group activities at Camp Tontozona. Twice a day
players run forward, backward and sideways. We dance through
traffic cones. The guards and tackles growl a lot.
</P>
<P>
   After morning practice, lunch. Meetings. A short nap. Then back
to the field which, literally, is right outside our trailer. Mom,
you thought ``my'' room was messy.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, we are cut off from civ ilization. Camp has one
telephone, for emergency use only. No TV.
</P>
<P>
   I have tried to keep up with the news. But here in the pines I
can pick up only two radio stations. One plays country-Western
music. The other broadcasts the voice of a faith healer in Del Rio,
Texas, who last night said the demon spirit must be cast ``owwwt''
if Mr. Clinton hopes to save his presidency. Did his grand jury
testimony not go well? &QL; 
 &QL; 
Staying alive &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I like to think this experience is making a real man out of me,
as op posed to a woman. For five days the freshmen were in what
Coach Sny der called a ``survival mode.'' Grad ually, I've fought
through the pain and fatigue. I endured the hoots of upperclassmen
during my failed at tempt to sing the fight song, which freshmen
are required to memorize and perform in its entirety at dinner. (I
wrote the words on my hand but got sweaty palms, and the ink ran).
</P>
<P>
   There are about 100 of us at camp. Captives, we have done some
serious male bonding. One player sneaked a female into his cabin
but was caught and reprimanded for harboring a pet raccoon.
</P>
<P>
   If only I could have just one night off. Four of us _ my cohorts
shall remain nameless _ have discussed slipping out of camp after
the after noon practice and going into Pay son, where we could do
something sinful, like sample the featured des sert, peanut-butter
pie, at Denny's.
</P>
<P>
   But it's 17 miles. I'm afraid we could spend all night trying to
flag a ride. And even if we did, we would look suspicious walking
around town. Our helmets would give us away.
</P>
<P>
   Bye for now,
</P>
<P>
   Your son &QR;

MIXED DOUBLES ON THE WAVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHARD COUCH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; MALIBU, Calif. _ You could say that San Clemente tandem surfers
Steve and Barrie Boehne are a little bit country, while Bobby
Friedman and his partner, Anna Schisler, are a little bit rock 'n'
roll.
</P>
<P>
   The Boehnes epitomize the classic style of tandem surfing. They
profess the beauty and coordination of the sport with the wide
range of lifts and maneuvers they've perfected in 30 years of
surfing together.
</P>
<P>
   Relative newcomers Friedman, 37, and Schisler, 26, are
well-versed in the classics, but once in a while they like to turn
up the volume and enter a mosh pit. They rode a 35-foot wave at
Todos Santos in Mexico's Baja California, but they also did some
slam dancing that day when a series of big sets caught them in the
impact zone.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the conditions are serene or extreme, when you see
tandem surfers interlocked on their longboards as they paddle into
the lineup, then sliding across the face of waves together, you can
feel the love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tandem surfing is like pairs figure skating _ technical and
graceful,'' said Steve Boehne, 51, a successful surfboard maker and
one of California's most respected tandem surfers. ``In most
sports, men share the experience with a guy. But when you're
surfing with a girl, there's a special relationship. It's really
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's really what tandem surfing is all about _ the mood,
the feeling and the companionship. With surfers like the Boehnes
and Friedman and Schisler leading the way, the exotic sport is
experiencing a revival as more couples discover the pleasures of
surfing as one.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``Surf's Up: An Anthology of Surfing,'' the fun
began in 1910, when Hawaiian surf legend Duke Kahanamoku became the
first modern surfer to ride a wave with a passenger on his board.
</P>
<P>
   The Duke once regaled Huntington Beach's Kimberly Slaight with
the story of his first surfing duet while she was a guest aboard
the Duke's boat, the Naduke, off Waikiki Beach in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was telling me, `You know how I introduce tandem surf?' ''
Slaight recalled. ``I said, `No.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `We were out here surfing one day and I grabbed one
of the beach boys. I put him on my shoulders and I surfed him in.
And that's how tandem surf originated.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The late Pete Peterson, a Santa Monica lifeguard and recognized
as !ital!the!off! nautical man of his day, saw Hawaiians tandem
surfing during a trip to the islands in 1932. He learned some of
the techniques, and a year later couples were tandem surfing in
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   After riding big waves with his fiancee at Sunset Beach on
Oahu's North Shore in 1966, Peterson passed the tandem surfing
torch to the Boehnes, who are credited with keeping the sport alive
during a lull in longboarding brought on by the advent of the
shortboard.
</P>
<P>
   Although tandem surfing was an event at the first Makaha
International Surfing Championships in Hawaii in 1954, when Walter
Hoffman and Joan Jones of San Juan Capistrano won first place,
interest in major competition also suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th annual Malibu Club Classic scheduled for Sept. 12-13 at
Malibu Surfrider Beach will contribute to the renaissance with
tandem surfing heats. Going for the title will be Malibu Surfing
Association members Bear Woznick and Andi Broccoli of Thousand
Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Woznick, 42, an accountant, and his girlfriend, Broccoli, 31,
surfed tandem on their first date. They learned their aggressive
style from close friends Friedman and Schisler, who will be the
favorites at the inaugural Association of Surfing
Professionals-sanctioned tandem competition that will be held in
Australia in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The ascent of Friedman and Schisler in the tandem surfing world
is a remarkable story in itself.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, raised in Southern California, is an all-around
athlete with a strong skateboarding and gymnastics background.
Schisler was a scholarship student with the Chicago Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   When they got together 4{ years ago, they were novice surfers.
But they were quick studies. After mastering the arabesque,
shoulder stand, falcon and other requisite lifts, the daring couple
was swept up by the allure of big surf.
</P>
<P>
   They subsequently broke down tandem surfing barriers by riding
20-foot-plus waves in Tahiti, Mexico and Hawaii's Sunset Beach,
Waimea Bay and Pipeline. Their newfound fame landed them
professional sponsorships and guest-starring roles on an episode of
``Baywatch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the way it makes me feel being out there,'' Schisler
said. ``It's different when you surf by yourself. I like the
feeling of looking up at him when we ride these beautiful waves.''
</P>
<P>
   However, their harrowing experience at Todos Santos, a life or
death situation when they were churned by three huge waves in a
row, brought them back to earth. But one more challenge looms
large: tow-in tandem surfing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might never happen,'' Friedman said of the big-wave craze
involving riders being towed into outer-reef monster-size waves by
partners on personal watercraft. After Todos Santos, ``We know when
to say when.''

PARK ENJOYING COLLEGE LIFE AS MUCH AS GOLF VICTORIES 
</HEADLINE>
 PARK-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The phone rings at Grace Park's apartment in Tempe, and almost
immediately after she answers, her laughter begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so excited,'' said the All-America sophomore, who played a
pivotal role on Arizona State's national championship golf team
last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, I haven't been this excited for quite a while. It's
like I'm on a mission.''
</P>
<P>
   The tendency would be to think that Park's enthusiasm is
directly related to the U.S. Amateur title she captured last
weekend, when she beat favored Jenny Chuasiriporn in the final, 7
and 6.
</P>
<P>
   It's not. Even though winning the Amateur was Park's biggest
golfing achievement, she has moved on. The Amateur party was the
night before at Grace's place. Been there, done that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going shopping tomorrow at Price Club, Target and Kmart,''
she said, giving her caller time to gasp.
</P>
<P>
   Price Club, Target and Kmart?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I've got to furnish this place. I don't even have a bed
yet. So that's why I'm so excited. This is my first place away from
home. Now I've got to decorate it. Lots of shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's the little things that count most in a world of
big expectations. Park has known this since she was 12 and made the
bold journey from her homeland in South Korea to America.
Eventually, she learned the English language and became fluent in
golf at Xavier College Prep and at Horizon High, winning three
state championships. Along the way Park was tutored by such noted
instructors as Bill Forrest, Chuck Hogan and Mike LaBauve, her
current teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Soo Nam Park, a wealthy restaurateur from Seoul, was
aware of Grace's athleticism, and he told her simply: ``Go for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Park is the ``second best'' player from South Korea,
trailing the accomplishments of Se Ri Pak at this time, she is
happy with what lies ahead. And, no, the immediate future will not
be in the pro ranks. ASU will do just fine, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lazy when it comes to school,'' she said. ``It's probably
going to take me five years to graduate. But I don't care, because
I'm having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she likes cruising around campus in her green BMW.
Fleeing dormitory life for her own place this year has been a big
plus. The only thing lacking is a boyfriend, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, you know any cute guys?'' she asked, laughing heartily
at her slightly bold question.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if the 19-year-old Park is busy putting together her
social life now that the golf portion seems as solid as one of her
300-yard drives. It's true: Twice during the U.S. Amateur played at
Barton Hills Country Club in Ann Arbor, Mich., she launched the
ball into an area off the tee that is reserved for guys like Tiger
Woods and John Daly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm longer than almost every (woman) out there,'' she
said. ``And my short game has gotten so much better. Especially my
wedges from 60 to 100 yards, and my putting. My confidence is so
high, now it's just a matter of practice and developing my own
system.''
</P>
<P>
   She looked like a world beater at the Amateur, where she knocked
off two Curtis Cup team players, the legendary Carol Semple
Thompson and Chuasiriporn, who lost a playoff to Pak earlier this
summer at the U.S. Open. Coupled with victories in the Western and
Trans National amateurs, Park became the first woman since Patty
Berg in 1938 to sweep the major women's amateur events.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that has gone wrong in the past year was a
collapse in the NCAA tournament, where she built a huge lead with
rounds of 65 and 65, then tumbled to third with rounds of 77 and
76. Despite the team's championship, Park broke down.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people thought it was inappropriate, but I couldn't
help it,'' she said. ``They stuck that camera in my face, and I
wasn't going to cry, but I just did. . . . I'm emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   Park's sensitive nature might be the main reason she ends up at
ASU for the full four years. There is no rush to get to Pak, whom
Park used to beat regularly when they were juniors, despite Pak
being 1{ years older.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can wait to be lonely,'' she said of life on the pro tour.
``That's still a little bit scary to me, even though I feel I have
the game. I'm in no hurry. I just want to have my world come
together gradually.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a strategy that's worked pretty well so far. &QL;

MEDIA MOGUL HEARST'S HEIRS BATTLE TRUSTEES OVER WILL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- It's the type of scandal William Randolph Hearst
would have loved to splash with banner headlines in his California
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   (ITAL)Media Mogul Reaches Out From Grave!
</P>
<P>
   Will Willie's Will Get Sunk Like the Maine?
</P>
<P>
   Billionaire Heirs Could End Up in Poorhouse!(END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   Today, almost 47 years to the day after his death, four of
Hearst's grandchildren have gone to Los Angeles Superior Court to
battle the 13 trustees who run the Hearst Corp. and control the
will. They claim the trustees are mismanaging the newspaper baron's
multibillion-dollar legacy, and they want an account of how the
corporation does business.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one problem.
</P>
<P>
   Before his death Aug. 14, 1951, Hearst tried to make sure no one
questioned his will by specifying that anyone who contested it
would be disinherited.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters even more perplexing, the paper trail from the
legal dispute is sealed from the public, as all related court
documents have been since Patty Hearst's kidnapping by the
Symbionese Liberation Army in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, rumors and hearsay surrounding the spat
finally went on the record at a hearing, where Judge Gary Klausner
and attorneys discussed the case publicly for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Three members of the Hearst family -- Joanne Castro, Deborah
Hearst Gay and William R. Hearst II -- filed the petition against
the trustees earlier this year and were later joined by a fourth
heir. Still, they represent only a fraction of the 35 beneficiaries
of the will.
</P>
<P>
   According to the dissident grandchildren's attorney, his clients
know little about what the trustees are doing and do not receive a
profit-and-loss statement from the company, which is run for the
most part by nonfamily members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a few shares in the Bank of America, and I get a
60-page statement every year in the annual report,'' said John
Sturgeon, attorney for three of the four Hearst heirs who are
challenging the will. ``My clients get nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   R. Wicks Stephens II, attorney for the trustees, pointed out
that a similar petition filed by William R. Hearst II last year was
turned down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you that the trustees are in all respects
administering the trust properly,'' Stephens said. ``Any suggestion
by anyone to the contrary is just patently false, and we are
confident that the courts will agree with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The grandchildren were not in court and could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Klausner seemed willing to unseal the files, quipping at last
week's hearing that protective orders should be reconsidered
``every 20 years or so.''
</P>
<P>
   With a pledge from the judge to consider opening the case for
public consumption, Sturgeon indicated that the long-dead media
mogul might be generating some more big headlines in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is that some sunlight here explaining the acts of the
trustees would be very beneficial,'' he said. ``The public should
know what is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   For the plaintiffs in the case, there's a lot more at stake than
the proceeds of a few newspaper subscriptions.
</P>
<P>
   When Forbes magazine ranked the world's richest people this
summer, the Hearst family was tied for No. 41 with a net worth of
$5.7 billion -- wealthier than Rupert Murdoch, Ted Turner or Ross
Perot.
</P>
<P>
   It came from William Randolph Hearst's empire, which he started
by taking over one of his father's failing newspapers -- the San
Francisco Examiner -- and later adding the New York Journal and
what would become the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   The Hearst Corp. still owns the historic downtown Los Angeles
building that housed the Herald-Examiner, which went out of
business in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst virtually reinvented journalism, using large headlines
and exaggeration to boost readership, stir debate and -- as the
legend goes -- help start the Spanish-American War.
</P>
<P>
   His supposed role in the war is repeated in history books.
</P>
<P>
   ``You furnish the pictures, I'll furnish the war,'' Hearst
reportedly wired to a New York Journal artist who had found little
action in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, the battleship Maine sank in Havana, Cuba.
After inflated stories came out blaming the Spanish for the attack,
Hearst's editorial demands for the use of military force against
Spain were met, and the nation went to war in 1898.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst seemed to love controversy, but not in his own life.
</P>
<P>
   When he died in 1951, his 125-page will contained an (ITAL)in
terrorem(END ITAL) clause (Latin for ``in terror''), which calls
for any heir who challenges the document to be disinherited.
</P>
<P>
   It's a clause that's commonly used today. Frank Sinatra checked
the (ITAL)in terrorem(END ITAL) box when he made out his will.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after at least two postponements of the hearing,
enough attorneys to field a hockey team crowded into probate court,
hoping to find out whether the dissidents can go forward with their
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clients absolutely cannot jeopardize their life income
from this . . . billion-dollar company,'' Sturgeon told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens said his clients are doing their jobs properly, and
asked the judge to deny the petition and throw the case out of
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The petition is a contest and should be denied safe harbor,''
Stephens said.
</P>
<P>
   (2ND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Klausner's ruling only complicated the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The judge concluded that taken as a whole, the beneficiaries'
five-part legal challenge defies the no-contest clause. But he said
if one or more of the parts is ``dropped out,'' his ruling could
change.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few weeks, Sturgeon will file five separate motions,
hoping to craft a lawsuit that will not put his clients at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that every time we do that, the trustees charge
all of their attorneys fees back to the beneficiaries,'' Sturgeon
said in court.
</P>
<P>
   Klausner admitted the plaintiffs are ``between a rock and a hard
place'' until he issues a final ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The judge pointed out that if the plaintiffs sue the trustees
and win, there will be no violation of the no-contest clause. But
if they sue and lose, they stand to lose their inheritance -- an
option that Sturgeon said isn't worth the risk.
</P>
<P>
   Challenges of (ITAL)in terrorem(END ITAL) clauses are rarely
successful, but the Hearst case is not unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern University law professor Herbert Krimmel said
no-contest clauses were almost impossible to challenge until 1990,
when the state Legislature changed the rules, making room for
good-faith attempts to clarify probate matters.
</P>
<P>
   Now dissidents like the plaintiffs in the Hearst case can go to
a judge and ask for a ``safe harbor'' ruling that says their
challenge will not violate the no-contest clause.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the risks, Krimmel said actions like the Hearst
grandchildren have taken are ``not a rare occurrence at all,'' and
that angry heirs ``get burned'' and lose their entire fortunes all
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago, ``Star Trek'' creator Gene Roddenberry's
daughter contested her father's will and lost in state court in a
case that attorneys for the estate called one of the biggest
disinheritances in American history.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Roddenberry stood to get 25 percent of her father's estate,
including proceeds from the ``Star Trek'' TV and movie series and
merchandising rights.
</P>
<P>
   Krimmel was skeptical that the Hearst dissidents would be given
safe harbor to challenge the will. He was particularly critical of
the part of their petition that asks the judge to void the
no-contest clause.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge stretch,'' Krimmel said. ``My suspicion is that
they will get slapped down for that one. . . . The only way you can
get rid of the (ITAL)in terrorem(END ITAL) clause is to knock down
the will.''

McDOWELL COMES BACK WITH A VENGEANCE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It's no secret that Jack McDowell's elbow is
so fragile that any pitch could be his last. That's why the Anaheim
Angels are happy to get each and every inning McDowell is able to
throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Innings, as many innings as he can give me,'' Angels manager
Terry Collins said when asked what he expected from McDowell
Wednesday night in the pitcher's first start since May 31.
</P>
<P>
   McDowell did Collins one better. The former Cy Young Award
winner gave the Angels seven SCORELESS innings in a 2-0 win over
the Detroit Tigers before 21,841 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The win enabled the Angels to maintain a 1{-game lead over Texas
in the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   McDowell's elbow problems limited him to six starts in 1997 with
the Cleveland Indians and only seven this year with the Angels.
He's been on the disabled list twice this season, the second stint
lasting more than 2{ months. That's why the Angels were cautiously
optimistic about McDowell's return.
</P>
<P>
   With Ken Hill suffering a setback in his attempted return from
elbow surgery, McDowell was a shot in the arm Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He retired the side in order in the first, fourth and seventh
innings. He gave up two hits in the second but got a double play to
help him escape. He gave up a two-out triple to Brian Hunter in the
third inning but stranded him. He also picked Hunter off first in
the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   McDowell (2-2) gave up five hits in seven innings, striking out
two and walking none. He warmed up before the eighth inning, but
Collins took him out before the inning started, replacing him with
Shigetoshi Hasegawa.
</P>
<P>
   Hasegawa pitched a 1-2-3 eighth inning and Troy Percival _ with
help from first baseman Darin Erstad, who made a spectacular diving
catch _ pitched the ninth for his 34th save.
</P>
<P>
   McDowell made 80 pitches, 59 for strikes, to get his first
victory since April 8, a 2-1 win over Boston. McDowell needed to be
that good considering the way Tigers starter Justin Thompson
(10-10) pitched.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson went eight innings, allowing two runs and nine hits,
but his biggest problem was Reggie Williams. Williams, starting in
place of Garret Anderson, doubled with two out in the third inning
and scored on Erstad's single for a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, Williams followed Gary DiSarcina's double with an
RBI single to make it 2-0. Williams, who entered this season having
played only 15 major-league games in a 10-year pro career, is
hitting .462 (6 for 13) in six games with the Angels since being
called up Aug. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had a chance to give themselves some breathing room
in the eighth after Randy Velarde walked and Erstad singled Velarde
to second. Velarde stole third, but Tim Salmon struck out. Pinch
hitter Craig Shipley then hit into an inning-ending double play.

KINGS CONTACT SUNS ABOUT SKILES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the second time this summer, Suns assistant coach Scott
Skiles has emerged as a candidate for a head coaching vacancy in
the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   A league source told the ``Arizona Republic'' on Wednesday that
the Sacramento Kings intend to interview Skiles for their coaching
vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings announced Tuesday that Eddie Jordan will not return as
that club's coach.
</P>
<P>
   Suns General Manager Bryan Colangelo confirmed that the Kings
contacted him about Skiles, but he would not elaborate other than
to say that the club expects Skiles' name to pop up in coaching
searches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's considered one of the up-and-coming young coaches in the
league,'' Colangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   Skiles, 34, was among four known candidates interviewed by the
Chicago Bulls to replace Phil Jackson, but the Bulls eventually
hired Iowa State Coach Tim Floyd instead.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were 33-64 under Jordan in a little more than one full
season. He replaced Garry St. Jean late in the 1996-97 season and
guided Sacramento to a 27-55 mark last season. Jordan came to the
club as an assistant in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Skiles, league sources said that Los Angeles
Lakers assistant coach Kurt Rambis is expected to be a candidate
for the Sacramento job. Rambis has emerged as a candidate for the
Los Angeles Clippers' opening.
</P>
<P>
   If Skiles lands the Kings job, he'll have his work cut out for
him. The Kings have had five head coaches since the franchise moved
to Northern California from Kansas City in 1985. None has had a
winning season.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Skiles nor his agent, Keith Glass, could be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Glass said earlier in the summer that the Denver Nuggets and
Clippers had inquired about Skiles, although neither club ever
formally asked to interview him. &QL;

ROOKIE SHOULDERS CHALLENGE  
 TIGHT END PUTTING INJURY IN PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he reported to training camp, Cardinals rookie tight end
Terry Hardy knew his dream of earning an NFL career centered on two
factors:
</P>
<P>
   Proving the time bomb he calls a left shoulder can withstand the
pounding of the NFL, and proving he can catch a football _ a
critical element of the West Coast offense.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth-round draft pick has answered one of the questions,
but time bombs are what they are until they're defused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've showed everybody on both issues,'' Hardy said.
``I know what I can do. It's just a matter of showing everybody
else.''
</P>
<P>
   The rap that probably cost Hardy, an excellent blocker, from
being drafted earlier out of Southern Mississippi concerned the
dislocated shoulder he suffered early in his senior season. The
injury stretched ligaments, tendons and possibly damaged the
rotator cuff.
</P>
<P>
   But he played through it. Still is, and without a twitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as bad as people think it is,'' said Hardy, who grew
up in Montgomery, Ala., believing basketball was his sport. ``I
haven't done anything special for it, and it hasn't been a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as tight as they would like, but I don't even think
about it. If it goes, it goes. I can't control that, so why worry
about things I can't control?''
</P>
<P>
   A coach faced with cutting a roster to 53 players has to worry
about it, and Coach Vince Tobin is no different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you have to think about it,'' Tobin said. ``But
what is encouraging is he hurt it early in the year last year and
played without any repercussions. He's proved he can play with it,
and it was proven strong enough to withstand a season, so that's
encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, because recurrence of the injury is greater if left
unrepaired, it's probable at season's end that Hardy will undergo
what is known as a Bankardt procedure, in which tendons are
transferred to tighten the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the shoulder is damaged again, the 6-foot-4,
266-pound Hardy thinks he has shown enough in camp to have
confidence he won't be tossed away as damaged goods. Tobin will
concur, because Hardy and veteran tight ends Chris Gedney and
Johnny McWilliams figure to give the team a solid rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in my mind I can catch and block at this
level,'' Hardy said. ``I think I've established myself enough to
know I can play in this league. Just being here and going through a
couple of preseason games, which are different from real games, has
allowed my confidence to reach that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have to keep my mind right, not get conceited and work
harder each day and learn.''
</P>
<P>
   In college he was used primarily as a run blocker, catching just
16 passes during his first three seasons and 12 as a senior. He has
quickly dispelled any notions that he suffers from ``dropsy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We liked him in minicamp when we first saw him,'' Tobin said.
``He's a much better athlete that what we anticipated because he
played on a team that ran the ball a lot. I think he can get deep.
I think all three of our tight ends can get deep. It's a strong
position for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy insists he couldn't have landed in a better situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyday I thank the Lord for the situation he has put me
in,'' he said. ``There are only three of us, so the workload is
greater, but that's a blessing because I get more reps. You learn
more by doing than by watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard how veterans sometimes lead rookies the wrong way
because they're after their job, but Johnny and Chris have really
been helpful.'' &QL;

MERCURY'S OPPONENT SUITABLE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL CORO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Needing a victory for playoff life, the Mercury had to like
having lowly Sacramento at home to get it Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Deep down, the Mercury's playoff opponent must make Coach Cheryl
Miller want to hop on the press table and dance. The Mercury went
3-0 against the Rockers, who will come to America West Arena at 5
p.m. Saturday to open the best-of-three semifinal series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me nervous because Cleveland is a very good team,''
Miller said of the 3-0 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Better than good of late. The Rockers (20-10), the WNBA's top
shooting team, swiped the Eastern Conference championship with a
four-game winning streak of their own and 10 wins in the last 14
games.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mercury (19-11) tensed up Cleveland's playoff chase by
sweeping the season series, twice in easy fashion before Aug. 10's
double-overtime thriller.
</P>
<P>
   ``We match up really well against them, just like New York
matched up really well with us,'' Mercury guard Michele Timms said.
``Little Umeki Webb does a fantastic job every time she's matched
up with (Cleveland's 6-3 Eva) Nemcova, who is one of the world's
best offensive players.''
</P>
<P>
   Nemcova was held to 11 points combined in the Mercury's first
two victories, a 76-61 July 2 game at Cleveland and a 76-60 home
win on July 10. But Nemcova, the WNBA's top three-point shooter,
did bust out for 19 in the double-overtime game, the only time the
Mercury saw Cleveland fully loaded.
</P>
<P>
   The teams' first meeting was Rockers guard Michelle Edwards'
first game back from injury and center Isabelle Fijalkowski, who
averaged 16.5 points and 8.5 rebounds in two Phoenix games, was out
sick in the second meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to win there on the road the last time,'' Mercury
guard Bridget Pettis said. ``I hope it won't be that close at home
(Saturday) so we can get the momentum and steal one at their
place.''
</P>
<P>
   The one constant for the Mercury in all three Cleveland games
was Jennifer Gillom. She had three of her best four scoring games
of the season against the Rockers, averaging 31 points on 54
percent shooting to go with 8.7 rebounds and 3.7 steals. That
includes a WNBA-season high 36 points in the last game at
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like playing there,'' Gillom said of Gund Arena,
where Cleveland is 11-4. ``I love the lighting. You see the basket
so clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, she does anyway. The rest of the Mercury was 48 for 141
from the field against the Rockers this year. Cleveland, last in
the WNBA in rebounds, also beat the Mercury on the boards, 104-96,
overall. Where the Mercury struggled scoring and rebounding outside
Gillom, it compensated on the other end against the drone-prone
Rockers offense.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland committed 62 turnovers to the Mercury's 37 in the
series. That's especially odd because point guard Suzie McConnell
Serio usually runs its offense with precision. &QL;

 DEEP WATER BECKONS ON HOT DAYS

 LAKES-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TONTO BASIN _ It's difficult to deny that the dog days of August
continue to plague fishing on Arizona's lower desert lakes.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to get a large number of accurate reports about
daytime fishing because of the heat. There just aren't that many
anglers willing to brave the humid heat for mediocre bass fishing.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves nighttime hours, when bass and crappie fishing is
pretty good. But fishing at night this time of year is iffy and can
be dangerous when sudden monsoon storms bring wind, lightning and
heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
   Often the storms are of short duration, but their intensity is
scary if you're in a fishing boat.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the monster factor. Some of us sensitive types
always hear monsters, hidden by darkness, crashing around on the
shore. I've never personally seen one, but I know they're out
there. Some climb under my bed at night, too.
</P>
<P>
   But night fishing at this time of year can't be questioned for
its effectiveness. Lakes such as Alamo, Saguaro, Canyon and Apache
have produced some good bass fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Anglers using floating or submerged lights also have made good
crappie catches at Alamo, Roosevelt and San Carlos lakes.
</P>
<P>
   And in the early morning, there is some top-water fishing at
almost all the lakes, even though the bass often are small.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't mind the heat of day, there are some fish to
be caught _ with some good bass reports from both Bartlett and San
Carlos.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Rambo, a crappie guide at Roosevelt Lake, isn't at all fond
of the heat, but since he doesn't like night fishing, either, it's
either heat or stay home. He'll take the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it gets too bad, we put on our life jackets and jump into
the lake,'' he said. Unfortunately, clothes get a little itchy when
the humidity is too high for them to dry quickly.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a particularly good time of year for guides. But
Rambo still accepts some clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I couldn't have been guiding for 10 years if my wife
(Margaret) hadn't gone to work every morning,'' he said. The Rambos
own a realty agency in Tonto Basin.
</P>
<P>
   Rambo has been catching crappie in the daylight hours. Some days
it might be a dozen or so, but others it may be 30 to 60. It
depends on being there when the crappie begin feeding on threadfin
shad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fish are deep,'' he said. ``Their mostly in about 30 feet
of water, and they don't usually move up until about 8:30, 9 in the
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   He is catching most of his crappie in the Haystack area, which
is across the lake from the marina. It's called Haystack because
barren, clay cliffs along the shoreline look something like
haystacks.
</P>
<P>
   The shoreline also reveals the underwater structure available.
The banks have eroded into steps. A flat shelf drops off to the
next shelf and so on. The crappie are moving from deeper water to
feed on shelves about 30 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   This is not easy fishing. Rambo's success comes from experience.
Deep-water fishing always is difficult for the average angler
because it's more difficult to feel a strike.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, crappie are not the vicious predators that bass
have the reputation of being. Strikes are remarkably light.
Sometimes its just a little movement of the rod tip.
</P>
<P>
   Rambo uses a light rod with extremely light line, usually
4-pound test. The lure is a brown 2-inch Power Grub with a
chartreuse curled tail. He uses an eighth-ounce lead head on the
grub so it will sink faster.
</P>
<P>
   Using a sonar device, he moves slowly along a shelf, looking for
concentrations of shad. Sometimes crappie can be seen with the
shad, sometimes not.
</P>
<P>
   When he finds an acceptable number of shad, he drops the lure to
the bottom, retrieves it about a foot from the bottom, then uses
his trolling motor to gently move along the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   ``You probably have a lot of hits you don't even know about,''
he said. ``You have to watch your rod tip and line all the time. If
you see or feel anything strange at all, set the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while, there's a slight jerk of the line that
indicates a crappie, but more likely, it might be a rod tip that
suddenly moves or a line that slackens. There also are small bass
to put up with and a lot of misses. The fish don't hold on. It's
infuriating until you get the hang of it.
</P>
<P>
   There are crappie below, but many of them are scattered. That's
why Rambo continues to move the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the really good days, you'll find a big school and can just
sit above them and drop down the lure,'' he said. ``That's when you
catch a lot of fish.''
</P>
<P>
   And the heat is always there. A slight breeze or monsoon clouds
make it cooler, but when the wind dies and the clouds clear, body
comfort drops drastically.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, swimming seems more appropriate than fishing. &QL;

   The Mercury isn't fooling itself.
</P>
<P>
   Its 71-62 WNBA playoff-clinching win over Sacramento on night at
America West Arena wasn't a masterpiece. And its 3-0 edge this
season over semifinal opponent Cleveland is deceptive and doesn't
mean a thing.
</P>
<P>
   But the alternatives _ to have lost and be on the outside of the
postseason like 1997 runner-up New York or to face defending
champion Houston in the semifinals _ are worse for a team
determined to make amends for its 41-point showing (still a league
low) in last year's playoff loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``The satisfaction (of making the playoffs) is seeing how we
play against Cleveland,'' Coach Cheryl Miller said. ``We didn't
just play to get in. That's not our approach or mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   The best-of-three semifinal series with Eastern Conference
champion Rockers (20-10) begins here at 5 p.m. Saturday, then
shifts to Gund Arena for games Monday, and if necessary Tuesday.
Phoenix (19-11) goes in on a four-game win streak, equaling its
season high, that includes a playoff-saving double-overtime victory
in Cleveland 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the Mercury beat the Rockers by 15 and 16 points, games
when Cleveland was not at full strength. ``That makes me nervous,''
said Miller of the regular-season dominance, a feeling echoed by
center Jennifer Gillom, who is averaging 31 points against the
Rockers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary,'' Gillom said. ``You start taking teams for
granted when you beat them three times, and it showed tonight (with
Sacramento). We played like we beat them three times before. We
just took them nonchalantly. We don't want to do that with
Cleveland. We know this playoff time, and those three games don't
matter any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento, which finished 8-22 and tied for last in the West
with Utah, jumped ahead, 10-4 and 18-13, and refused to fold even
after Phoenix took a lead it would never relinquish on back-to-back
layups by Umeki Webb, the second with 5:17 left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Monarchs actually pulled even at 25 at 2:21 before
intermission, only to allow eight straight points and almost
another basket as the buzzer sounded on a full-court inbounds pass
from Gillom that left Bridget Pettis too wide-open to convert a
layup.
</P>
<P>
   Despite chilly shooting (33.3 from the field, 18.2 from
three-point), the Mercury slowly built the lead to 10, 59-49, with
8:16 remaining only to see Sacramento still within three, 64-61, on
a layup by Latasha Byears at 1:35.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight was the most stressful game New York had lost (to
Detroit before the Mercury tip-off), and it meant we could slip
into third (playoff seed),'' point guard Michele Timms said. ``It
put a little bit more pressure than if New York had of won, and I
felt it more than I had any other game.''
</P>
<P>
   But the veteran, who admits to having a less than stellar
season, responded with a tough running 10-footer at the 4:05 mark
and four free throws in the final 35 seconds, keeping Phoenix
perfect (8-0) vs. the Monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   Gillom was 7 for 24 from the field but spun to the baseline past
former teammate Pauline Jordan to score a layup when Sacramento was
within three for the last of her team-high 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with an off shooting night, we needed her,'' Miller said
of her league Most Valuable Player candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Byears had 18 points and Adia Barnes, the Pac-10 Player of the
Year for Arizona, had 18 rebounds and 13 points before fouling out.
Barnes scored her rookie season-high of 24 three days earlier in
the Monarchs' 85-69 loss to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give a lot of credit to Sacramento to come in here and play
the type of game that they did,'' Miller said. ``It's indicative of
what Heidi (VanDerveer) has instilled. They are a very young and
talented team.''
</P>
<P>
   VanDerveer is 13-30 since replacing Mary Murphy as head coach
halfway through the 1997 season and hoping to return next season
when Ruthie Bolton-Holifield will be back from major knee surgery
to team with Ticha Penicheiro at the guard position. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't look now, but the Diamondbacks first season is quickly
winding down.
</P>
<P>
   With only 36 games remaining in their inaugural season,
Wednesday afternoon's 8-2 loss to Montreal simply will be logged
away as one of the many losses the club will incur in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal starter Dustin Hermanson basically shoved his
assortment of pitches down the throats of Arizona's batters, who
were nearly unanimous in tipping their cap to one of the Expos'
brightest young players.
</P>
<P>
   While players like Hermanson and the multitalented Vladimir
Guerrero, who hit a monstrous two-run home run in the first inning,
give the Expos reason to point toward the future, the Diamondbacks
are doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   The final five weeks of the season will not only see the
Diamondbacks trying to avoid 100 losses (they must finish 16-20 to
do so), but this will also be a time when Manager Buck Showalter
will audition several of the lesser-used players.
</P>
<P>
   It will be an important time for a few Diamondbacks, notably
players such as Yamil Benitez, David Dellucci and a few minor
leaguers who will be on the big-league roster when it expands Sept.
1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some things left to do here,'' Showalter said.
``There are some at-bats and innings I want to give to some people
around here.''
</P>
<P>
   It would not be unusual for Showalter to leave someone like
Benitez in the starting lineup for a two-week stretch. After all,
it is in major league games that clubs learn what a player can
really do.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of winter league games in the Caribbean can simulate
how a player responds to big-league pressure. It's also a safe bet
that several players on the roster will be down to their final days
with the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   One player whose future with the Diamondbacks is unknown is
Wednesday's starter, Amaury Telemaco, whose record dropped to 4-8
while his ERA rose to 3.98 after allowing three runs in six
innings.
</P>
<P>
   While there was some mild praise for Telemaco after the loss,
the reality is that the young right-hander must start to show
significant progress or start to worry about his future in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Telemaco has won only once since July 13 and only twice in 11
starts since being inserted into the rotation. He served up a fat
hanging slider to Guerrero in the first that landed about 20 rows
deep down the left field line.
</P>
<P>
   Telemaco wound up giving up two more runs, although only one was
earned because of a throwing error by catcher Kelly Stinnett, who
easily could have been charged with another error but was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amaury is capable of better than what he showed today,''
Showalter said. ``He worked through it, though.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point promise must turn into production and even though
it may seem unfair to simply point to the final 36 games as the
end-all, that is one of the propositions facing the Diamondbacks
and several players on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Bernard Gilkey, acquired from the New York Mets on
July 31, finally flexed some muscle and had his first extra-base
hit in 60 at-bats since becoming a Diamondback.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike players such as Dellucci, Benitez and Karim Garcia, who
may see his playing time cut in the near future, Gilkey has the
luxury of being a big-ticket item. The Diamondbacks are on the hook
to pay him nearly $11 million the next two seasons, and he will
probably be a fixture in the outfield at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   These are the dog days of August, but several players better not
take the attitude that they can slough off this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be taking a close look at a lot of things these
last few weeks,'' Showalter said. ``It's a very important time for
us.'' &QL;

JOB OF SAVING GAMES LONELY, HIGH-WIRE ACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By definition, their job description says it all: They are in
the game to put out a fire. Little else matters in the life of a
closer.
</P>
<P>
   They are daredevils living on the game's high wire, all eyes
fixed on every pitch. The job of closer is arguably the most
difficult in baseball. At the very least, it's the loneliest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we come in, a game is on the line,'' said John
Franco of the New York Mets, one of the best closers ever. ``You
have to be mentally tough to have this job, there's just no way
around that fact. Some make it a tougher job than it really is. You
have to realize it's just a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Mark Wohlers, who until this season was considered one
of the most dominant closers, recently, and inexplicably,
unraveled. He cannot find the strike zone, often throwing pitches
well over the batter's head.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers' numbers have been atrocious as he goes through one of
the worst stretches a big-league pitcher has ever seen. The Braves
were so distrustful of their saves leader of the past three years,
they requested he return to the minor leagues for further
refinement.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers reluctantly accepted his second trip to the minors this
season, but his results at Triple-A Richmond have done little to
bolster the confidence of Atlanta's front office, coaching staff or
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the closer is in a slump, you lose,'' Braves pitching coach
Leo Mazzone told the ``Atlanta Journal-Constitution'' recently.
``If you look around, every closer has been taken out of his job at
one time or another. Mark just has to fight to get it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Several supporters and teammates have pointed to Wohlers
impending divorce as a possible reason for his slide into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that Wohlers is not the first pitcher to lose his
ability to pitch consistently. The names of Mitch Williams and
Steve Blass spring out. Although Blass was a starter, he suffered
the same experience as Wohlers. He simply could not throw strikes
one season after winning 19 games for Pittsburgh in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, nicknamed the ``Wild Thing'' for obvious reasons, was
never a sure thing. The images of then-Philadelphia Manager Jim
Fregosi and pitcher Curt Schilling shielding their eyes while
Williams did his thing in the 1993 playoffs still stand out.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, few can forget the greatest tragedy a closer has
ever encountered: The suicide of former California Angels reliever
Donnie Moore, who surrendered the home run to Boston's Dave
Henderson that sent the Red Sox onto the 1986 World Series instead
of the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Though the fallout from that one bad pitch haunted Moore for the
rest of his playing career, he also was believed to be battling
personal demons of his own that led to his untimely death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a what-have-you-done-for-me-lately business,''
Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter said. ``It's often not the arm
that is the deciding factor in a closer being successful. Not
everybody can do it. They're swashbucklers. They come in and let it
fly, basically saying, `Here it is, hit it if you can.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The life of a closer is the loneliest of any of the 25 players
on a major league roster. While the position players routinely get
four or five at-bats per game and a starting pitcher has as many as
nine innings, a closer is afforded no such luxury.
</P>
<P>
   The closer almost always comes into a game in the ninth inning
with his team leading by three runs or less. There is little margin
for error. One mistake in a one-run game can be disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a fragile job,'' said Dennis Eckersley, who many
consider the finest ever. ``The weight of the entire team is on
you. Make a mistake and everyone looks to you as the reason for a
loss. It's a bitch of a way to go through life.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckersley, whose 390 saves rank second on the all-time list,
relies on fear of failure as his motivation. When he was saving
games for those great Oakland clubs, Eckersley was a creature of
habits he followed religiously.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, he would smoke the first of two cigarettes.
In the fifth, he would use the bathroom. In the seventh, he would
finish his second cigarette, and before the start of the eighth, he
would saunter to the bullpen with a cup of steaming coffee in his
pitching hand.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Anaheim's Troy Percival start pacing back and forth
in the bullpen as soon as the eighth inning begins in a close game.
</P>
<P>
   Every closer has his personal nuances and quirks.
</P>
<P>
   Securing the final three outs of a game has always been tough.
That's why the list of the truly great closers remains relatively
short.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hitter has already had three or four at-bats and has a sense
of his timing down,'' Philadelphia's Ricky Bottalico said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our life revolves around nothing extraordinary happening. If
it does, it means we, personally and as a team, have been beaten.
There is always a sense of urgency when we step into a game.'' &QL;

 BASEBALL-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   What I could really use is another baseball strike. And I'm not
just speaking for myself . . . oh, all right, I am, too.
</P>
<P>
   But still, there are lots of fantasy owners out there who are
fulfilling their fantasy at this moment by leading their leagues.
</P>
<P>
   And what we all need now is a stoppage in play, starting in 45
minutes. Because if your team is like mine, this lead is not going
to be able to hang on to the ledge much longer.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, strictly hypothetical mind you, say you have a
four-point lead heading into the week. And let's say you lead a
pack of FIVE others in the saves category, only you have lost your
closer, Randy Myers, to the National League, which means all five
of those teams on your heels will now pass you in that category.
</P>
<P>
   This is what's known as a slow death.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for those who lost Randy Johnson. Replacing his
innings with a starter off the scrap pile will introduce your ERA
and WHIP to the world of pain. Unless you really luck out and all
your competition goes into the toilet, your team is going to fade. &QL; 
The dead weight &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The same players that get you to the top can also bring you back
down. Pudge Rodriguez of the Rangers is hitting .205 this month. He
could use a few days off, but the AL West race is too tight so he
won't get them.
</P>
<P>
   But at least he's playing. Those counting on Cecil Fielder's
numbers can stop counting, although he'll get a few at-bats with
the Indians now, particularly since David Justice is in such a
slump (29 for 122) and injured Jim Thome is out for another month.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, it helps to have some guys not play. Paul
Sorrento is 6 for 55 with two RBIs in his past 22 games. Blech!
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sele has won once and has a 7.04 ERA since the All-Star
Game.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Mesa has been pretty awful since joining the Giants, but he
has won four games and that's all a fantasy owner cares about.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Hernandez is hitting .171 since the Cubs traded Kevin Orie,
but that's still better than Orie. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Hot stuff &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ray Lankford is feasting on all the walks Mark McGwire gets.
He's hitting .342 with 11 homers and 42 RBIs in 35 games since the
break. McGwire is hitting just over .200 lately _ no way to catch
Maris.
</P>
<P>
   Brady Anderson is red-hot, belting five homers last week.
Teammate Chris Hoiles is batting higher than .270 and is hitting
grand slams. Mike Simms of Texas slugged three HRs and hit .529
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Smith of Tampa Bay is hitting over .300 and has been
inserted into the 3-hole in the Devil Rays' order.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Offerman has turned himself into a keeper, batting higher
than .300 and more than 30 steals.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Hunter, of 0-for-22 fame, is hitting .364 over the past
two weeks. But he's not going to come close to his 74 steals of
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's Mike Maddux hasn't allowed an earned run in a month.
He's the type of sleeper who can help maintain a good ERA and WHIP.
The D-Backs' Willie Banks is pitching almost as well, as are Dan
Miceli and Donne Wall. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Nice problem to have &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will try to find a spot in the lineup for Chili
Davis. They tested Darryl Strawberry in left field last week. &QL; 
 &QL; 
See ya Bip &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bip Roberts says he is considering retiring after the season if
the A's don't make an offer. Don't hold your breath, Bip. One of
'98's great lines came from Royals game announcer Josh Lewin when
he said the next time Bip is involved in a brawl, it could be the
first 49-on-1 fight in the history of the game. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; PIRU, Calif. _ They practice with pellet guns because the real
things are banned in their country, but the Japanese shooters have
managed top finishes.
</P>
<P>
   The personnel aide to the president of Ecuador will be competing
while his boss is off having surgery.
</P>
<P>
   And the defending champ is an Australian.
</P>
<P>
   Those looking for a global smorgasbord of the quickest draws in
the West will be here starting today as the 15th World Speed
Shooting Championships kick off at this tiny citrus outpost in
Ventura County.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a chance for someone to see the Michael Jordans of the
shooting world,'' said Cameron Hopkins, editor of American
Handgunner magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed the Steel Challenge, the event pits more than 200
shooters against steel targets and the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people from all walks of life _ doctors, lawyers, auto
mechanics, construction workers, dentists,'' said co-organizer Mike
Dalton of Mission Hills. ``And they all have one common bond: They
love speed shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Most competitive shooting is done with paper bull's-eyes and
scoring for accuracy, Dalton said. Some spectators _ if you can
even call shooting a spectator sport _ view those contests as
stagnant.
</P>
<P>
   Not so with metal targets, Hopkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can the hear the clang of steel and see the reactive
targets bounce and move and smudge as the bullet makes a smear on
the white paint,'' he explained. ``And there are big electronic
timers to follow the action.''
</P>
<P>
   Participants draw handguns from their holsters and fire at five
metal plates set at distances of 8 to 40 yards. Once all are hit,
the clock stops. The process is repeated several times over seven
stages. By day's end, contestants with the lowest combined time win
in each division, which include open, women's, teen, pre-teen (ages
8 to 12), law enforcement, revolver, cowboy single action and team.
</P>
<P>
   There are no scoring demerits for missing, but, Dalton said,
``You penalize yourself if you miss because you are wasting time.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there is no governing body to deem the event the official
world championships, it is recognized as the top competition of its
kind, Hopkins said.
</P>
<P>
   The match's executive directors _ Dalton, a San Fernando Police
officer, and Valencia's Mike Fichman _ founded the Steel Challenge
in 1981 and ran it through 1985 before selling the rights. The
buyers operated the match until 1993 before canceling it because of
low attendance and sponsor support.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton and Fichman bought the tourney back in 1995, and, after a
three-year hiatus, the World Speed Shooting Championships were
resurrected last year in Piru. The founders were fueled by stronger
shooter support and an interested industry that now foots a $90,000
tournament budget, covering everything from tents, targets and
trophies to building materials and construction workers' paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   As a private enterprise, money from entry fees and the shooting
industry goes into a revolving fund to assure the continued health
of the Steel Challenge, said Dalton, who won the event's stock gun
division in 1992 with his duty weapon, a Colt .45.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton said, ``Our main thrust is to generate more interest and
get more people shooting, to expose them to something they may not
have seen before and let them experience what handgun shooting is
all about and see the best shooters in the world doing it.''

RODRIGUEZ SOON TO JOIN 40-40 CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez is on the verge of becoming the
third player ever to reach 40 home runs and 40 stolen bases in the
same season.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who had 36 home runs and 36 stolen bases entering
Wednesday's game, will probably rewrite most every offensive record
every held by a shortstop before he's done playing. Just last week
he became the fourth youngest player to reach 100 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew at the beginning of the year Alex was going to do it,''
said Jose Canseco, who along with Barry Bonds are the only players
to achieve 40-40 in one season. ``In fact, when I first met him, I
told him he was going to do it, get 40-40. Right now, I don't think
either one is going to be tough for Alex. I think he's already
there. I think he'll do it within two weeks, three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's 1998 numbers project to nearly a 50-50 season.
Entering Wednesday's game, the three-time All-Star was on pace to
hit 47 home runs and steal 48 bases. Canseco, who often boasted of
becoming a member of the 50-50 club, now scoffs at anyone being
capable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's impossible,'' Canseco said. ''I just don't see
it happening.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rodriguez, who last year became the first player other than
Cal Ripken to start an All-Star Game at shortstop for the American
League since 1983, hit his 100th home run last week at 23 years 16
days, he passed Johnny Bench (23 years, 161 days) and Hank Aaron
(23, 191). He trails only Mel Ott (22, 132), Tony Conigliaro (22,
197) and Eddie Mathews (22, 292).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a marvelous year,'' Mariners Manager Lou Piniella
said. ``He's a marvelous player. He can do anything that needs to
be done on the baseball field. He seems to be getting better and
better. The young man can play, period.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
The two-headed monster &QL; 
 &QL; 
Randy Myers, who has 347 career saves, insists he will be fine in
his new role for San Diego for the remainder of this season, which
will include being the primary set-up pitcher for Padres closer
Trevor Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem with whatever role they put me in,'' Myers
said. ``If I can help get the ball to Trevor or take some of the
workload off him, I will. Basically I'm there to help Trevor and
solidify the bullpen, especially on the left side. I'll do whatever
I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   A potential problem will occur next season if Myers is still
with the Padres. There is little chance Myers and Hoffman could
co-exist for a full season sharing the closing duties, let alone
having Myers return to a role as a set-up pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were going to go out and get a left-handed reliever,
well, we just went out and got the best one we ever could,''
pitching coach Dave Stewart said. ``Overall, our bullpen has been
good all year. But Myers makes us better. He can deal. That's why
he has 300-and-some saves.''
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's front office feels confident it will be able to
trade Myers, and the $12 million he will be owed the next two
seasons, over the winter. &QL; 
 &QL; 
You, you're fired &QL; 
 &QL; 
Reggie Jackson and George Steinbrenner's often strained
relationship, is on the outs in Yankee-land once again. Jackson
resigned from his post as special assistant to Steinbrenner last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner became furious after reading a quote from Jackson
in a magazine story where Jackson used a vulgarity to describe the
Yankee boss. Whatever happens between these two strong-willed
personalities, Jackson said the two will forever be linked because
of the Yankees tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though I don't think it'll be easy to work things out,'' said
Jackson, whose No. 44 is one of the many retired numbers at Yankee
Stadium, ``I think it could be, because I'm a Yankee.''
</P>
<P>
   Several sources within the Yankee organization (no, George
Costanza was not one) say Steinbrenner was furious about the
reference and basically pushed for Jackson to resign. Jackson
countered that he was frustrated with his lack of responsibility
within the front office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just didn't work out the way I wanted it to,'' Jackson
said. ``I wished I could've done more. I was frustrated because I
couldn't make a larger contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   This book, no doubt, will have more chapters. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Holding out for more &QL; 
 &QL; 
Jack McKeon, who has helped bring the Cincinnati Reds out of the
funk that previous Manager Ray Knight dragged them into, has been
offered a one-year contract extension that offers him a small
raise.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon, who recently guided the Reds to 15 victories in a
16-game stretch, is holding out for a larger raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stepped into a difficult situation that was a mess, got
things straightened out around here, did a lot of (public
relations) work in the community, kept the team out of all the
controversy that always seems to be here and worked hard with the
media,'' McKeon said. ``That has to be worth something.''
</P>
<P>
   McKeon, known for his quick wit, which sometimes offends his
players and other managers, offered up these two gems in the last
10 days:
</P>
<P>
   On why he attends church every day: ``With the way this team
plays, I have to go to church every day.''
</P>
<P>
   And after his Reds beat Milwaukee on consecutive nights by the
scores of 17-0 and 4-0: ``If we shut 'em out, we have a chance to
win.'' &QL;

CHOOSING A TEAM ON THE FLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In our sports-obsessed nation, few activities _ no
matter how recreational in nature _ are free from being saddled
with the ``competition'' label. One only has to look as far as
professional bowling to get my drift.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are holy events like the World Series. But even
tossing a wad of paper at a trash bucket can take on a wholly
challenging tone between workplace rivals when phrases like ``two
out of three'' are uttered.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the words ``competitive'' and ``fly-fishing'' have rarely
been strung together.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who are ambivalent about it and hell-bent
against it,'' said Simi Valley's Ken Holder of Team USA Flyfishing,
a six-member squad selected more or less by default to contend
starting Wednesday at the 18th annual World Flyfishing
Championships, in Zakopane, Poland. ``Fly-fishing is not to be
raped and pillaged, they say; it's a solitary affair.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why the U.S. has never held elimination-type contests to
select its representatives for the international playing field, the
way the other 23 countries vying for the crown over five days in
Poland traditionally have done.
</P>
<P>
   There is not enough interest in competitive fly-fishing to hold
state championships or some other process to determine our top
fly-anglers, said Holder. The 41-year-old Holder balances his zeal
for dry flies and cutthroat trout with his job as operating manager
of aircraft maintenance services for United Airlines-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could even field a better team by some sort of elimination.
I think we lack the desire,'' Holder said. ``The people we will be
fishing against will be the best fishermen these countries have to
offer.''
</P>
<P>
   That might explain Team USA Flyfishing's dismal record; it has
yet to crack the top 15 at any world championships. Even last year
on its home field of Jackson Hole, Wyo. _ the first time America
hosted the event _ Team USA finished in the bottom three.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy a stellar reputation to uphold in Poland, but, Holder
said, ``This is, believe it or not, our best opportunity we've had
in a long time because our anchors on the team are three
professional fly-fishermen who live, breathe, eat, think and sleep
fly-fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   They are Wyoming guides Jay Buchner, Jeff Currier and Gary
Willmott, ``guys who have dedicated their lives to the sport,''
Holder noted.
</P>
<P>
   Saltwater guide and skipper Walter Ungermann of Barnstable,
Mass., also made the cut. Rounding out the squad are Holder and
Dick Recchia of Long Beach, vice chairman for Mitsubishi Motor
Sales of America.
</P>
<P>
   Holder and Recchia might not be as well-qualified for the team.
In fact, Holder said, Team USA is using the Poland championships to
thank the people who played key roles in organizing last year's
event in Jackson Hole. Holder said Recchia's signature was on the
$275,000 check Mitsubishi wrote as title sponsor for the contest.
Holder, a Team USA board member, volunteered to manage a ``sponsors
tournament'' that was staged separately from the championships but
played by the same rules.
</P>
<P>
   Holder, whose 250-pound, 6-foot-5 frame gives him the ability to
``cast farther because I'm higher out the water and get fish others
can't because I wade deeper,'' and Recchia, whose team won the
sponsors tournament last year and who regularly competes in Jackson
Hole's famous One Fly Tournament, promise to hold their own.
</P>
<P>
   Recchia, 59, was flattered and more than a tad anxious when
asked by Team USA to be on the squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it when they called,'' he said. ``When
fly-fishing is a passion, it's like an amateur golfer being told,
`We want you to play in the Masters.' The excitement gave way to a
little bit of panic and terror, because everybody in the
fly-fishing world knows what happened to us last year and is
looking for some improvement this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Fishing technique is strong for the team as it prepares to
tackle Poland's wild brown trout, rainbow trout, grayling and
huchen (Eurasian landlocked salmon), Recchia said. ``The
disadvantage is the strange water, strange flies and strange
fish,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Ungermann has already been in Poland for a few weeks studying
the waters to give the team as much of an edge as possible. The
other members, all of whom are paying their own expenses, will have
been there at least a week before the tournament to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between winning and losing this event is the
amount of research you do,'' Recchia said. ``And, most important of
all, be lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Holder, who is managing the team, detests the phrase ``old boys
club'' to describe Team USA's selection committee, but he doesn't
necessarily dispute it, either. He prefers ``network of people.''
Either way, there is no organized process to pick team members, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since ``no one stepped to the plate,'' Holder said, to field a
squad for the first couple of world championships, a group of
fly-fishermen with good-size wallets in the early 1980s formed Team
USA Inc. in Ventura County. A board of directors was created and
funds were set aside for administrative costs and to assure the
team's future in international competition. Today, not altogether
coincidentally, Ungermann is president and a team member.
</P>
<P>
   Holder said Team USA Flyfishing is considering expanding its
search for competitors by taking out ads in national angling
magazines and requesting ``fishing resumes'' before the 1999 world
championships in Australia. For now, its arbitrary selections are
all we have.
</P>
<P>
   And until we get passionate about ``competitive fly-fishing,''
it's unlikely that fans will be lining the banks of such places as
Poland's Dunajec River and Czorstyn Reservoir chanting ``U.S.A.,
U.S.A.''

picked up by several news organizations, including The New York
Times in both its news and editorial pages, the actual drop now
appears to be half that size or even less.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If Montreal right-handed pitcher Dustin Hermanson looked right
at home while striking out eight Diamondbacks in an 8-2 Montreal
victory at Bank One Ballpark on Wednesday, it figures.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old Hermanson lives in north Phoenix and says he'd
love to play for Arizona someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beautiful place to play,'' Hermanson said. ``How can
you not like going to a ballpark that closes when it's hot and has
real grass on the field?''
</P>
<P>
   If Hermanson hopes to play his real home games at Bank One
Ballpark, he's making a fair sales pitch. His victory was his third
victory in three starts against Arizona. In those three games he's
yielded only five earned runs in 23 innings _ a 1.96 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is,'' he said. ``I try to pitch the same
against every team. I've pitched better than that without
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Hermanson said the Diamondbacks are somewhat like the Expos, who
have won only four more games than Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a young, up-and-coming team looking for their talent
to progress and stick together,'' he said. ``You can't have success
right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Hermanson was in complete command, limiting the Diamondbacks to
one hit _ a Karim Garcia bloop single to right _ through 5 innings.
Bernard Gilkey touched him for a solo home run in the sixth and
Matt Williams hit his second home run in as many nights in the
seventh before Hermanson gave way to Shayne Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just went after them,'' said Hermanson, who began the season
in the bullpen. ``I had a good slider, and I kept changing speed.
It's like I tell everybody, every inning is a closer-inning . I try
to pitch with a closer's mentality.'' &QL; 
Milestone &QL; 
Montreal Manager Felipe Alou found a bottle of champagne waiting
for him after the victory. It was his 521st victory as manager of
the Expos, moving him past Buck Rodgers (1985-91) and to the top of
the club's all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen champagne since the 1962 playoffs,'' Alou
joked. ``I didn't think they used champagne anymore. I thought they
would buy beer. Champagne's too expensive.'' &QL; 
Oops &QL; 
A security guard stationed next to the bleachers down the
first-base line committed a cardinal sin _ he interfered with a
ball hit by Montreal's Brad Fullmer in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   He apparently thought the ball had gone foul, picked it up and
chucked it into the stands. But the ball was fair and in play.
Fullmer was awarded a ground-rule double, which might have been a
break for the Diamondbacks. The ball was headed into the corner and
might have resulted in a triple.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, the security guard was re-assigned to another area
of the ballpark between innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to our guy in charge of security (Sean Maguire) and
told him to just talk to him and let him know he committed a
serious offense,'' club President Rich Dozer said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozer said he did not know the security man's name. &QL;  &QL; 
Snake bites &QL;  &QL; 
The Diamondbacks worked out Dave Licini, an 18-year-old outfielder
from South Bend, Ind., but did not immediately offer him a
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Licini a 6-foot-4, 202-pound undrafted free agent has committed
as a walk-on to Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Cory Lidle will undergo ligament-replacement surgery on
his right, throwing, elbow today in Los Angeles. Reknowned
orthopedic surgeon Lewis Yocum will perform the procedure, which is
the same one done on former All-Star Tommy John. &QL;  &QL;

AL powers put 
Rangers in hole
<TEXT>
<P>
   Softer schedule offers hope
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By BILL SULLIVAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ARLINGTON _ Johnny Oates whistled on his way to work, strolling
down the tunnel, bounding up the dugout steps and taking the
playing field with purposeful strides.
</P>
<P>
   Whistling by the graveyard? Whistling in the dark?
</P>
<P>
   Nope. Just whistling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those other games, they're over,'' the Rangers' manager said
with a smile. ``Sure, it's been frustrating, but you keep plugging
along.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the idea as the Rangers returned home Wednesday night
after a 2-6 road trip through Cleveland, New York and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-1 win over the Cleveland Indians behind a combined
five-hitter by Aaron Sele and John Wetteland helped ease the pain
of the road just traveled, but the trek was still a hot topic of
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   The good news?
</P>
<P>
   Texas was in every game on the trip. Four of the losses were by
one or two runs. In each of the last three, the Rangers led in the
fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The bad?
</P>
<P>
   Texas lost each of those last three, including both ends of a
drizzly Tuesday doubleheader in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the Rangers scored as many runs (35) as they
gave up on the trip, bunching 16 of them in an 11-run win over the
Yankees wasn't the most efficient way to spread the wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Going 1-for-15 with runners in scoring position in the last
three games didn't help much, either.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, what had been a three-game lead over Anaheim in
the American League West has become a one-game deficit. And the
stiff competition hasn't ended for the Rangers, with the Indians in
again tonight and the relentless Yankees due for three over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   So what to make of a close-but-no-cigar run through the AL
gantlet?
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Will Clark opted for the happier spin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play bad baseball, but we didn't find a way to win,
and that's what we have to do,'' he said. ``We know we can play
with these guys, but we still have to go out and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   With 37 games to go, the Rangers face a challenge if they are to
win their second AL West title in three years.
</P>
<P>
   After this eight-game homestand (Detroit comes in for three
after the Yankees leave), Texas finishes with 19 of its last 30 on
the road, including the last seven (three at Anaheim, four at
Seattle).
</P>
<P>
   For now, Oates hopes to minimize the damage against the top
clubs and still be alive when the Tigers, White Sox and Twins start
coming around again. The next four days figure prominently in that
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a manager, you certainly know it's going to be a tough
period, playing the three best clubs in the American League,'' he
said. ``It'll drive you crazy if the third game into it, you start
thinking about the 13th or 14th.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't prevent fans and media from charting the progress _
or lack of same _ as the Rangers sank slowly in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday's bounce-back win, Texas had dropped eight of
10 overall, beginning with the last two games of the previous
homestand. The much-discussed stretch of 17 games in 18 days
(featuring seven with the Yankees, six with Boston and four with
Cleveland) had produced just a 4-8 record as the Rangers stumbled
back from New England.
</P>
<P>
   At the July 31 trade deadline, Texas supposedly fortified itself
for just such a challenge. In deals with the Cardinals and Marlins,
general manager Doug Melvin picked up a front-line starting pitcher
(Todd Stottlemyre) and shortstop (Royce Clayton) from St. Louis for
struggling lefthander Darren Oliver and young third baseman
Fernando Tatis.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin plugged the hole at third by getting Todd Zeile from
Florida for two minor-leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we're better equipped than we were three weeks ago,''
Oates said. ``I'm talking about veterans who know how to play the
game, how to handle tight situations.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the impact has been marginal.
</P>
<P>
   In three starts as a Ranger, Stottlemyre is 2-1 but has lasted a
total of just 15 innings, compiling a very Ranger-like 6.89 ERA.
Clayton is hitting .311 with five doubles and eight RBIs. Zeile is
hitting just .232 with six errors in his last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Oates insists his team is better with Stottlemyre
(instead of the disappointing Oliver); Clayton (who replaces the
statue-like Kevin Elster); and Zeile, whose three home runs since
coming to Texas match Tatis' total in 330 at-bats prior to the
trade.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, the manager says, is that the additions can't do it
all themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other people have to keep doing their jobs,'' Oates said.
``Juan (Gonzalez) has to continue to hit; Pudge (Rodriguez) has to
hit. Will has to do his thing at first, and Rusty (Greer) has to do
his thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer (.298) has come on after a slow start but went 0-for-5 in
the doubleheader Tuesday. Rodriguez hit just .258 over a 24-game
stretch. And no one is talking about Hack Wilson's RBI record
anymore after watching Gonzalez (.294, 34 home runs, 120 RBIs)
drive in just 19 runs since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of all this, the starting pitching _ never better
than a shaky proposition _ has broken down. Tuesday, for example,
neither John Burkett nor Rick Helling survived the sixth inning,
putting further strain on an overworked bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we need is a break or two, and it can turn the whole
tide,'' Clark said. ``That's what we're looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent gloom and doom, the Rangers can see a parting
of the clouds on the horizon. The what-goes-around-comes-around
schedule is about to subject the Angels to a similar test.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday, Texas' next 19 games are against Detroit, the
White Sox, Minnesota, Kansas City and Tampa Bay, teams that were a
combined 94 games under .500 through Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim, meanwhile, plays 10 games in New York (five in four
days), Boston (three) and Cleveland (two) beginning next week.
</P>
<P>
   So if the Rangers can get to Sunday without losing too much more
ground, the sun may come out again. ``There's only one barometer,''
Oates said. ``That's where you are at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting there needn't be all fun.

STANLEY POWERS RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ So now the Red Sox have another
righthanded-hitting DH screaming to be noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Jim Leyritz, Mike Stanley didn't have to say a word.
</P>
<P>
   A steady presence since he quietly rejoined the Red Sox in
Anaheim from Toronto on the last day of July, Stanley called
attention to himself here Wednesday night with his bat, driving in
six runs with two two-run homers sandwiched around a two-run single
in an 11-1 win over the Kansas City Royals at Kauffman Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   With 26 home runs, Stanley matched his career high. He also
became the first Sox player to drive in a half-dozen runs in a game
this season. The Sox had 14 hits, including three apiece by John
Valentin and Damon Buford, against ex-Cardinal Brian Barber,
attempting a comeback in the American Legaue with a surgically
repaired elbow, and two relievers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came here trying to fit in,'' said Stanley, Dan
Duquette's choice to fill the void left by the trade of the unhappy
Leyritz to San Diego in June. ``It was a nice, easy adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   Staked to an 8-0 lead after two innings, knuckleballer Tim
Wakefield went the distance for his second complete game, throwing
a five-hitter for his 15th win of the season, one short of the
career high he set in 1995, the last time the Sox went to the
playoffs. Wakefield, who walked five and did not strike out a
batter, was coming off a game in which he gave up 11 hits and nine
runs (seven earned) in four innings.
</P>
<P>
   The difference Wednesday night? ``I wish I knew,'' Wakefield
said. ``They didn't hit the ball. I don't know. Last (time) was one
of those starts where it didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this has been a good year as far as run support. I never
complain about too many runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's win established a high-water mark for the Sox
this season: 24 games over .500 (74-50), their best record since
they ended the '95 season 28 games above the break-even point.
</P>
<P>
   The win kept them seven games in front of Baltimore in the
wild-card race. The Orioles also won Wednesday night and are 30-8
since the All-Star break, a Yankee-like pace they would seem hard
pressed to maintain for the last six weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to try and get as greedy as we can get,'' Stanley
said. ``Every time we look up, Baltimore is still winning. We'd
like to think they can't keep that up, especially where we have six
games with them the last two weeks, including the last four at
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to have a five-games-or-better lead in the last four
days.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are 12-6 since Stanley reclaimed the place in the
clubhouse he lost when he was traded to the Yankees last August for
two pitchers _ one of whom, Tony Armas Jr., Duquette turned around
and used in the Pedro Martinez deal.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley is batting .317 since his return and has 18 RBIs in 17
games. ``He sat down in front of his locker,'' said Mo Vaughn, who
was aboard for both of Stanley's home runs Wednesday night, ``and
it was like he never left.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley drove center fielder Johnny Damon to the wall in
left-center to catch his drive off lefthander Chris Haney in the
sixth, a ball that carried farther than Stanley thought it would.
He flied out to right in his last at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley rejected the notion that he felt pressure to contribute
immediately upon his return to the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt different from last year when I went to New York,
where I felt like I had to prove something,'' he said. ``This year,
coming back here, I was so comfortable. I'd played for Jimy
(Williams) and knew so many guys here, it was easy to slide right
in and contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox arrived here on the heels of the Yankees, who beat
the Royals 10 straight times for the first season series sweep in
the 96-year history of the Bombers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees are stacked on top of stacked,'' Royals DH Terry
Pen-dleton said Wednesday. ``They're the best team I've seen in my
15 years in the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox haven't been quite as dominant against Kansas City, a
past tormentor, but they've come close. Wednesday night's win made
the Red Sox 8-2 against the Royals, the first time Boston has won
as many as eight games against Kansas City since 1979. This after
their doubleheader sweep Tuesday night against Texas gave the Sox
their first winning record (6-5) against the Rangers in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Sox and Yankees, the Royals are 2-18. Against the
rest of the American League, they're a .500 team (53-53).
</P>
<P>
   House of horrors? The Royals have the worst home record in the
league, 23-42.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming off the last couple of wins, we want to keep things
rolling,'' Stanley said. ``We can't let down. We want to push
hard.''

   JERUSALEM _ Israeli society suffers from the syndrome of the
abused child. That is the only reasonable answer to the frequently
posed question of how a people that suffered so long, that was
victimized for 3,000 years, can be indifferent to the suffering it
inflicts on another people.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Israel was formed against the backdrop of the most
chilling act of genocide in modern history. Israel cannot escape
that traumatic past. As in the case of an adult survivor of
childhood abuse, a primal insecurity informs our perception of
reality.
</P>
<P>
   Every danger _ whether real or imagined, large or small _ is
experienced in terms of our long history of persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Living in Israel, it is not hard to justify our self-perception
as victims. Suicide bombings in Israeli cities have killed and
maimed dozens of civilians in recent years. Israel remains in a
state of war with half its neighbors. This reality is easily read
in terms of our collective memory as victims.
</P>
<P>
   Yet our identity as the eternal victim prevents us from
realizing that today we are not only victims. Just as some victims
of child abuse turn into victimizers as adults, we Israelis, having
assumed a position of power over others, have ourselves become
victimizers.
</P>
<P>
   It is the syndrome of the abused child that informs the attitude
of the Israeli public to human rights violations committed by our
security forces in the Occupied Territories. Take, for example, the
case of the public debate about torture in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The use of torture by the Israeli security service is routine.
Thousands of Palestinian detainees are violently shaken, kept for
days in excruciating positions, denied sleep for prolonged periods
or subjected to extremes of noise, cold and filth. Israeli
officials publicly acknowledge such practices.
</P>
<P>
   Torture's stigma prompts most nations to deny any use of force
in interrogations, but the Israeli public, at large, supports the
use of torture as a legitimate means to defend security.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's resort to collective forms of punishment provokes a
similar response.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 10 years, Israel has demolished more than 400 houses
of family members of Palestinians suspected of violent acts against
Israel. No public outcry has been raised about this policy, which
has rendered homeless hundreds of innocent people, many of them
children and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli public opinion has also remained indifferent to the
blatantly discriminatory manner in which this policy is applied.
Only Palestinians are subjected to collective punishments.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when 29 Palestinians were killed by an Israeli
settler at the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, Israel took
seriously the fundamental legal principle that every person is
responsible for his or her own acts. It did not take reprisals
against innocent people, such as the family or neighbors of the
perpetrator of the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's repressive policies cannot be compared to the horrors
of the Holocaust. Yet neither can our suffering in the past,
however terrible, be used to excuse present wrongs.
</P>
<P>
   The syndrome of the abused child only exacerbates the cycle of
violence in the Middle East. The experience of occupation and
dispossession has turned Palestinians into the new generation of
``abused children.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, Palestinians often justify the sufferings caused by
suicide bombs in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem by the affliction we cause
to them. This in turn reinforces our self-perception as perpetual
victims.
</P>
<P>
   This cycle of victimhood has profound effects on the potential
for a negotiated settlement of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   A peace process has begun, yet a peace based on human rights
violations is fragile at its core. Collective punishment, brutality
and needless humiliation diminish the willingness for
reconciliation and compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Milestones are often an occasion for introspection. This year
Israel celebrated its 50th anniversary and the international
community is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights. It is a timely opportunity to
recognize and begin to address our syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   We must not forget the past, but neither can we let our painful
history make us complacent toward the suffering we cause to
others. &QL;

   JERUSALEM _ Israeli society suffers from the syndrome of the
abused child. That is the only reasonable answer to the frequently
posed question of how a people that suffered so long, that was
victimized for 3,000 years, can be indifferent to the suffering it
inflicts on another people.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Israel was formed against the backdrop of the most
chilling act of genocide in modern history. Israel cannot escape
that traumatic past. As in the case of an adult survivor of
childhood abuse, a primal insecurity informs our perception of
reality.
</P>
<P>
   Every danger _ whether real or imagined, large or small _ is
experienced in terms of our long history of persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Living in Israel, it is not hard to justify our self-perception
as victims. Suicide bombings in Israeli cities have killed and
maimed dozens of civilians in recent years. Israel remains in a
state of war with half its neighbors. This reality is easily read
in terms of our collective memory as victims.
</P>
<P>
   Yet our identity as the eternal victim prevents us from
realizing that today we are not only victims. Just as some victims
of child abuse turn into victimizers as adults, we Israelis, having
assumed a position of power over others, have ourselves become
victimizers.
</P>
<P>
   It is the syndrome of the abused child that informs the attitude
of the Israeli public to human rights violations committed by our
security forces in the Occupied Territories. Take, for example, the
case of the public debate about torture in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The use of torture by the Israeli security service is routine.
Thousands of Palestinian detainees are violently shaken, kept for
days in excruciating positions, denied sleep for prolonged periods
or subjected to extremes of noise, cold and filth. Israeli
officials publicly acknowledge such practices.
</P>
<P>
   Torture's stigma prompts most nations to deny any use of force
in interrogations, but the Israeli public, at large, supports the
use of torture as a legitimate means to defend security.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's resort to collective forms of punishment provokes a
similar response.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 10 years, Israel has demolished more than 400 houses
of family members of Palestinians suspected of violent acts against
Israel. No public outcry has been raised about this policy, which
has rendered homeless hundreds of innocent people, many of them
children and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli public opinion has also remained indifferent to the
blatantly discriminatory manner in which this policy is applied.
Only Palestinians are subjected to collective punishments.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when 29 Palestinians were killed by an Israeli
settler at the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, Israel took
seriously the fundamental legal principle that every person is
responsible for his or her own acts. It did not take reprisals
against innocent people, such as the family or neighbors of the
perpetrator of the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's repressive policies cannot be compared to the horrors
of the Holocaust. Yet neither can our suffering in the past,
however terrible, be used to excuse present wrongs.
</P>
<P>
   The syndrome of the abused child only exacerbates the cycle of
violence in the Middle East. The experience of occupation and
dispossession has turned Palestinians into the new generation of
``abused children.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, Palestinians often justify the sufferings caused by
suicide bombs in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem by the affliction we cause
to them. This in turn reinforces our self-perception as perpetual
victims.
</P>
<P>
   This cycle of victimhood has profound effects on the potential
for a negotiated settlement of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   A peace process has begun, yet a peace based on human rights
violations is fragile at its core. Collective punishment, brutality
and needless humiliation diminish the willingness for
reconciliation and compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Milestones are often an occasion for introspection. This year
Israel celebrated its 50th anniversary and the international
community is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights. It is a timely opportunity to
recognize and begin to address our syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   We must not forget the past, but neither can we let our painful
history make us complacent toward the suffering we cause to
others. &QL;

   TOKYO _ Deep disappointment in President Bill Clinton,
admiration for the American system and worry about U.S. leadership
during Asia's economic crisis characterized Asian editorial
commentary Wednesday following Clinton's admission of lying about
an extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   Many commentators said the president's moral authority and his
presidency were irreversibly damaged, that he had disgraced himself
and that his televised speech was not sincere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than a straight confession, we got the impression this
was a well-calculated act to protect himself,'' said Japan's Asahi
Shimbun.
</P>
<P>
   In Seoul, Hong Kong and Tokyo, editorials worried about the
impact of Clinton's admission on his credibility as a world leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, however critical we are of Washington's
international behavior, its presence and engagement are necessary
for world stability in the broadest sense,'' said the Hong Kong
Standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially now that countries in Asia and beyond are in the
throes of economic difficulties, a U.S. brooding over domestic
politics at the expense of its international role and obligations
should be strongly discouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Seoul's leading dailies, Jungang Ilbo, echoed that worry.
``The primary concern now is the danger that the U.S. may lose
consistency and trust, for that matter, in its policies,
particularly foreign policy,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know there is a direct link between the credibility of
the president and trustworthiness of the country he represents.''
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo's Yomiuri Shimbun said it was possible that Clinton would
be little more than a lame duck leader for the remainder of his
term, concluding: ``The international community will be paying
close attention to see whether Mr. Clinton will be able to put the
matter behind him and return to the role that is expected of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Words of praise were saved for Hillary Rodham Clinton and the
American system. The Korean Broadcasting System commented Tuesday
night that ``Hillary's attitude was impressive,'' and Singapore
television praised her for ``standing by her man.''
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia, where former President Suharto was forced out of
office this year after 32 years in power, The Jakarta Post said
Clinton had ``shown his gallantry'' by admitting his guilt and it
said it was understandable that Americans, with a robust economy,
would continue to support him.
</P>
<P>
   It added that ``compared to hundreds of millions of people in
countries ruled by dictators and military despots who exploit their
nations' wealth for their own interests, Americans are far luckier
to live in a country governed by a solid constitution that
guarantees their rights and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. system that forced Clinton to admit before a grand jury
that he lied about an extramarital affair was widely praised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Above all, the Lewinsky affair reminds us that everyone is
equal before the law in America,'' said Hankook Ilbo, a major
Korean daily. ``The case is so impressive because it proves that
the U.S. adheres to the rule of law even when a president is
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of Japan's Parliament, Yuriko Koike, interviewed
Tuesday by the Mainichi Shimbun, said she admired the fight between
politicians and prosecutors as well as Clinton's decision to go
before the nation on television: ``By doing so, the United States
as a nation succeeds in gaining a stronger system.''
</P>
<P>
   But others saw a decline in U.S. public life. ``This phenomenon,
probably, uncovers a far more serious malaise _ the decline and
approaching meltdown of American society itself,'' wrote a
Philippine Star commentator, Max Soliven.
</P>
<P>
   Thai politicians interviewed by The Nation in Bangkok said the
problem was with the lie and its impact on Clinton's credibility
with American voters, not the affair itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the sexual matter, it is up to the American people to
decide how they want their leader to be,'' said one. `` In the old
days, kings had many wives.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly alone as a national leader willing to publicly comment,
the newly elected president of the Philippines, Joseph Estrada, was
quoted by Reuters Tuesday as saying he agreed with Clinton that
leaders are entitled to their privacy: ``Definitely. We are only
human beings. We have to have private lives also.''
</P>
<P>
   Estrada has been criticized by the Catholic church for his
lifestyle. He is reported to have as many as 10 children by various
women.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In Europe, Mixed Reactions &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton drew mockery and skepticism from European
newspapers over his confessions regarding his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky, Reuters reported from London.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Clinton's tenure will continue for some time to come,''
said The Times of London. But, ``The Clinton era is already over.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Mirror, a tabloid, was equally blunt. ``Bill Clinton
has shamed the American presidency,'' it said. ``He shamed it by
having an affair with a young worker at the White House. But most
of all, he shamed it because he then lied to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy's Il Giornale spoke of ``the suicide of a president in
front of the television cameras,'' while a Swedish newspaper,
Expressen, quoted a Moderates Party deputy, Beatrice Ask, as
saying: ``I wouldn't stand by the wimp.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Prime Minister Goran Persson of Sweden lamented on
television: ``There's too much digging into people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The French press, which has a reputation of being largely
indifferent to the sexual arrangements of politicians, seemed to
suggest that America would be a far healthier place if it were
France.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bill Clinton had dared to cry out his confession instead of
murmuring it, if he had clearly confessed rather than quibbling,
this great sinner would have shown himself to be a great
president,'' Le Figaro said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Financial Times said: ``There is enough time left in
this presidency, enough important jobs to be done at home and
abroad for Mr. Clinton to go some way towards rebuilding his
status.'' &QL;

   TOKYO _ Deep disappointment in President Bill Clinton,
admiration for the American system and worry about U.S. leadership
during Asia's economic crisis characterized Asian editorial
commentary Wednesday following Clinton's admission of lying about
an extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   Many commentators said the president's moral authority and his
presidency were irreversibly damaged, that he had disgraced himself
and that his televised speech was not sincere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than a straight confession, we got the impression this
was a well-calculated act to protect himself,'' said Japan's Asahi
Shimbun.
</P>
<P>
   In Seoul, Hong Kong and Tokyo, editorials worried about the
impact of Clinton's admission on his credibility as a world leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, however critical we are of Washington's
international behavior, its presence and engagement are necessary
for world stability in the broadest sense,'' said the Hong Kong
Standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially now that countries in Asia and beyond are in the
throes of economic difficulties, a U.S. brooding over domestic
politics at the expense of its international role and obligations
should be strongly discouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Seoul's leading dailies, Jungang Ilbo, echoed that worry.
``The primary concern now is the danger that the U.S. may lose
consistency and trust, for that matter, in its policies,
particularly foreign policy,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know there is a direct link between the credibility of
the president and trustworthiness of the country he represents.''
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo's Yomiuri Shimbun said it was possible that Clinton would
be little more than a lame duck leader for the remainder of his
term, concluding: ``The international community will be paying
close attention to see whether Mr. Clinton will be able to put the
matter behind him and return to the role that is expected of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Words of praise were saved for Hillary Rodham Clinton and the
American system. The Korean Broadcasting System commented Tuesday
night that ``Hillary's attitude was impressive,'' and Singapore
television praised her for ``standing by her man.''
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia, where former President Suharto was forced out of
office this year after 32 years in power, The Jakarta Post said
Clinton had ``shown his gallantry'' by admitting his guilt and it
said it was understandable that Americans, with a robust economy,
would continue to support him.
</P>
<P>
   It added that ``compared to hundreds of millions of people in
countries ruled by dictators and military despots who exploit their
nations' wealth for their own interests, Americans are far luckier
to live in a country governed by a solid constitution that
guarantees their rights and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. system that forced Clinton to admit before a grand jury
that he lied about an extramarital affair was widely praised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Above all, the Lewinsky affair reminds us that everyone is
equal before the law in America,'' said Hankook Ilbo, a major
Korean daily. ``The case is so impressive because it proves that
the U.S. adheres to the rule of law even when a president is
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of Japan's Parliament, Yuriko Koike, interviewed
Tuesday by the Mainichi Shimbun, said she admired the fight between
politicians and prosecutors as well as Clinton's decision to go
before the nation on television: ``By doing so, the United States
as a nation succeeds in gaining a stronger system.''
</P>
<P>
   But others saw a decline in U.S. public life. ``This phenomenon,
probably, uncovers a far more serious malaise _ the decline and
approaching meltdown of American society itself,'' wrote a
Philippine Star commentator, Max Soliven.
</P>
<P>
   Thai politicians interviewed by The Nation in Bangkok said the
problem was with the lie and its impact on Clinton's credibility
with American voters, not the affair itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the sexual matter, it is up to the American people to
decide how they want their leader to be,'' said one. `` In the old
days, kings had many wives.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly alone as a national leader willing to publicly comment,
the newly elected president of the Philippines, Joseph Estrada, was
quoted by Reuters Tuesday as saying he agreed with Clinton that
leaders are entitled to their privacy: ``Definitely. We are only
human beings. We have to have private lives also.''
</P>
<P>
   Estrada has been criticized by the Catholic church for his
lifestyle. He is reported to have as many as 10 children by various
women.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In Europe, Mixed Reactions &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton drew mockery and skepticism from European
newspapers over his confessions regarding his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky, Reuters reported from London.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Clinton's tenure will continue for some time to come,''
said The Times of London. But, ``The Clinton era is already over.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Mirror, a tabloid, was equally blunt. ``Bill Clinton
has shamed the American presidency,'' it said. ``He shamed it by
having an affair with a young worker at the White House. But most
of all, he shamed it because he then lied to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy's Il Giornale spoke of ``the suicide of a president in
front of the television cameras,'' while a Swedish newspaper,
Expressen, quoted a Moderates Party deputy, Beatrice Ask, as
saying: ``I wouldn't stand by the wimp.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Prime Minister Goran Persson of Sweden lamented on
television: ``There's too much digging into people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The French press, which has a reputation of being largely
indifferent to the sexual arrangements of politicians, seemed to
suggest that America would be a far healthier place if it were
France.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bill Clinton had dared to cry out his confession instead of
murmuring it, if he had clearly confessed rather than quibbling,
this great sinner would have shown himself to be a great
president,'' Le Figaro said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Financial Times said: ``There is enough time left in
this presidency, enough important jobs to be done at home and
abroad for Mr. Clinton to go some way towards rebuilding his
status.'' &QL;

ACADEMY OF SCIENCES RECOMMENDS FOOD SAFETY CZAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To reduce the threat of food-borne illness, the
National Academy of Sciences on Thursday recommended the
appointment of a national food safety czar with the power to manage
federal food safety programs now run by 12 different government
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   That person would oversee all federal food safety activities,
including inspection, surveillance, investigation of food-related
illnesses, research and education.
</P>
<P>
   ``This recommendation envisions an identifiable, high-ranking,
presidentially appointed head, who would direct and coordinate
federal activities and speak to the nation, giving federal food
safety efforts a single voice,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy of Sciences is a private non-profit
research organization that advises the government on scientific and
health issues.
</P>
<P>
   The 194-page report _ entitled ``Ensuring Safe Food From
Production to Consumption'' _ concluded that food safety laws are
outdated and that efforts to rid the food supply of contamination
are hampered by a fragmented federal structure.
</P>
<P>
   The food safety system in the United States ``lacks a central
authority and is hampered by old laws that don't allow flexible
responses to today's threats,'' said John C. Bailar III, chairman
of the Department of Health Studies at the University of Chicago,
who chaired the 13-member scientific panel which wrote the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the challenges to ensuring safe food change and grow more
complex, it is crucial that we rethink how to address the greatest
threats to human health,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report urged Congress to eliminate carcass-by-carcass
inspection of meat and poultry and replace it with scientific
testing for disease-causing germs.
</P>
<P>
   It also recommended a single set of regulations for all foods,
replacing the current patchwork system spread out among a dozen
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Under present practice, for example, the pepperoni line in a
pizza factory is inspected daily by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, while the cheese line is checked once in 10 years by
the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The food industry reacted to the report by lambasting the
recommendation for restructuring the food regulatory system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calling for a wholesale reorganization of federal
bureaucracies in Washington will not do anything to ensure the
safety of our food supply,'' said Cal Collier, senior vice
president and general counsel for Kraft Foods, Inc., who chairs a
food industry group called the Food Safety\Independent Food Agency
Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   The report also advised Congress to restrict food imports to
those countries with food safety standards equivalent to those in
the United States. President Clinton has endorsed such an approach
and Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., has introduced the legislation in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J., and
Reps. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., and Frank Pallone, D-N.J. have also
sponsored legislation that would combine the 12 government agencies
into a single Food Safety Administration. But that proposal has
faced resistance from the food industry and from the federal
agencies that now oversee food safety.
</P>
<P>
   Fazio hailed the NAS report as ``common-sense recommendations
that will improve our food safety system.''
</P>
<P>
   Durbin's spokeswoman Melissa Merz said, ``The message in the
report is clear that American consumers and families will benefit
from a single coordinated approach to food safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of food safety for the Center
for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington advocacy group,
said a food-safety czar with power over the budgets of food safety
agencies would be a good interim step, but is ``not the final
answer to the food safety problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Short of the president of the United States, no one is really
in charge of the safety of the U.S. food supply,'' DeWaal said. ``I
don't see how a single person can really run the program unless
there is a single food safety agency.'
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. General Accounting Office has estimated that
contaminated food causes 9,100 deaths a year and as many as 81
million illnesses in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Disease outbreaks from food-borne germs are likely to become
increasingly frequent in the future, according to the Journal of
the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The $350,000 NAS study was paid for with federal money in the
1998 Department of Agriculture spending bill.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Reaching for the old gang
 &HT;    (For release Aug. 23, 1998)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The editorial board of the Miami News has not met for
almost 10 years. That's because the newspaper has been out of
business that long. But, after hearing Bill Clinton's brief,
incomplete talk to the nation last Monday, I wished the board was
still around _ to keep me from going off the deep end.
</P>
<P>
   That's the value of newspaper editorial boards. They keep most
editors from being journalistic despots. Often, the editorial board
of the Miami News had a position different from that of the editor,
and the position of the board usually prevailed. Yes, I had a veto
power and used it once but shouldn't have. Overruling the editorial
board can undermine its confidence. Besides, collectively, they
were far wiser than me.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to Clinton's talk, I felt strongly that the man
ought to resign for the good of the country. It wasn't about sex.
It had all to do with him lying to his country, his closest
advisers and, apparently, to his wife and child for seven months _
dragging the nation through a voyeuristic purgatory.
</P>
<P>
   Before I said that in writing, however, I felt a need for the
advice the old editorial board would impart when they saw my knee
begin twitching. So I called them one by one to get their thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   It did not surprise me that I was the only one wanting to seek
Clinton's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   I will tell you that I believed this board to be somewhere
between moderate and liberal on the political spectrum but will add
that conservatives in Miami considered it quite left-leaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the arguments against Clinton is on a scale of being
great,'' one responded to my query. ``This isn't Watergate. There's
a lot more going on; there's plenty of wrong on Ken Starr's side.
Hey, Bill Clinton's always been a liar; we re-elected him knowing
that. He's done a good job as president. He stands for what others
in Washington don't stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed in him,'' said another former board member.
``He came off as incredibly selfish. But I don't think he ought to
resign and I certainly don't think he ought to be impeached. Every
president comes up against groupies. I feel sorry for the people
around him. He did everybody wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   I pushed back. ``You gave me every reason why he should be gone,
but you concluded, without reason, that he should stay. How do you
justify it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't,'' she answered, ``other than we don't need this at
this time.''
</P>
<P>
   I reserved what I believed would be the last call to our most
outspoken editorial board member. His positions usually were
illustrated with theatrical flair and it is obvious he has not
changed these past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I heard him speak, I wanted him to resign, too,'' he
told me. ``But then I read that smirking editorial in the Wall
Street Journal and, well, I can't have Kenneth Starr winning. Once
they get Clinton out, they'll go after Al Gore. And when they get
him, we're left with Newt. God spare us that!''
</P>
<P>
   There was yet another call to make _ to my publisher, my boss at
the time. While he did not sit on the editorial board, I consulted
often with him, as a publisher ultimately is responsible for the
conduct (and positions) of the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't want Clinton to resign or be impeached either. ``Yes,
Clinton has debased the presidency,'' the former publisher said.
``But our stakes in this world are so large that this country can't
face such an upheaval. We've got to make the best of a very bad
situation. The office of the independent prosecutor has become a
fourth branch of government; it has enormous power _ too much
power. We need to go another route.''
</P>
<P>
   So, this telephone reunion of sorts has left me out in the cold.
My former advisers (and boss) say we need to hang on to Clinton. My
heart tells me to call for his resignation, but the people I trust
journalistically tell me that this is no time to jerk my knee.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so we keep the guy around. But to anyone who believes
anything he's got to say, I've got a bridge in Brooklyn I want to
sell you.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Right-wing conspiracy still going strong
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton's misbehaviors and the corrosion they
have set on his administration are his own fault and his own
responsibility but they never should have become a state issue.
They have because of the wanton misuse of a special-prosecutor law
that was over-broad in the first place and because Hillary Clinton
was right, even if in the mistaken cause of defending her husband:
a vast right-wing conspiracy really has been out to get the
president. Her, too.
</P>
<P>
   If largely informal, a whole sour-grapes network kicked in
against Clinton even before his first inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of hard-right, often vile radio talk shows around the
country took up a Clinton-as-demon theme and pounded it for years,
gushing faxed accusations churned out by right-wing mills.
</P>
<P>
   Megawatt televangelists _ most notably but not only Jerry
Falwell and Pat Robertson _ had the president behind every evil,
even including serial murder, and the first lady as chief witch to
a national coven of feminist hags.
</P>
<P>
   At least a half-dozen right-wing foundations spent millions to
set their media and legal dogs on the couple, as in the Paula Jones
non-case.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was not merely to contest with Clinton over policy
disagreements; that's standard. It was to deny the very legitimacy
of his elections in an unremitting push to establish ideological
absolutes.
</P>
<P>
   And although few Republicans have been intimates of this
campaign, many have been its greedy beneficiaries, denying Clinton
even customary grants of bipartisanship. His judicial and other
appointees, for instance, have been vetted, sometimes harassed and
often defamed for a suspected extremism neither they nor the
president displayed.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter partisanship was born of Republicans' disbelief they
had lost the presidency; they had come to think it was theirs
almost by right. Then Clinton's re-election devastated hopes raised
by GOP control of Congress for a Republican hegemony at long last.
Any partisan excess could be justified because moderate Clinton was
held to be not just anomalous but inauthentic for an electorate
believed to want seamless conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   The replacement of a neutral special prosecutor with a legal and
political antagonist of Clinton's set up the president for
permanent investigation. After that, Clinton opponents had only to
declare a stink for Kenneth Starr to take it as a scent or for
other special prosecutors to be called. There are now five at work.
Republicans are pressing for a sixth.
</P>
<P>
   An independent-counsel statute that was meant for extraordinary
situations now pounces on every target of opportunity with the
bully nightstick of law enforcement, to the point where, in order
finally to get something on Clinton, Starr wound up in seeming
collusion with the Jones lawyers to bait and trip the president
over a profoundly personal matter.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is stewing in his own juice. Serves him right. But do
the rest of us want to continue to license the prosecutorial excess
and reward the ideological mortal combat that together have, as
they set out to do, brought him _ and us _ to this sorry pass?

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: JUST HOW LOW CAN WE GO?
 &HT;    For use Sunday, Aug. 23 and thereafter
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON ``The bitch set me up,'' said the mayor of
Washington, right after being caught on videotape smoking crack
cocaine in a downtown hotel room by an FBI sting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did have a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that was not
appropriate,'' said the president of the United States, months
after being caught having sex with a young intern near the Oval
Office by a federal grand jury probe.
</P>
<P>
   If a shamed Bill Clinton stages a comeback, it will be because a
unashamed Marion Barry serves as his de facto political role model.
Such are the wretched depths to which we have sunk in our public
life.
</P>
<P>
   Barry's constituents reelected him in 1994 because they believed
that he had been unjustly treated by the prosecutors and the press.
The Washington jury that had found Barry guilty of a misdemeanor,
thereby limiting his sentence and enabling his subsequent revival,
reflected that constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Constitution, the House Judiciary Committee's 35
members will serve as the president's initial jurors after they get
the independent counsel's report on Clinton's shenanigans. His best
hope of escaping impeachment hearings rests on his poll-driven
belief that the public wants this scandal to go away.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 20 minutes into the networks' analysis of the speech
in which Clinton attacked Ken Starr, his court-appointed nemesis,
ABC switched its viewers back to pre-season Monday Night Football.
Assuming Clinton survives in office, it was a decision worthy of a
gilt-edged State Dinner invitation.
</P>
<P>
   An honest Clinton speech about his lies about his affair could
have borrowed a phrase from Barry, namely: ``The bitches set me
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton believes, not without cause, that he and Monica Lewinsky
were drawn into a sting operation by Linda Tripp and her onetime
literary agent, Lucianne Goldberg, aimed at gathering evidence of a
sexual liaison.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg got Tripp to suggest to Lewinsky that she use a courier
service run by Goldberg's brother to send love letters to Clinton.
Goldberg then told a Newsweek reporter how to get those billing
records.
</P>
<P>
   Next, they arranged for Paula Jones' legal team to get
Lewinsky's name. Then Tripp briefed Starr's team and wore an FBI
wire while eliciting more damning admissions from Lewinsky. That
same Friday evening, she briefed Jones' lawyers on that wire job.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Clinton walked into a perjury trap. While he
knew that Lewinsky was on Jones' witness list, he also knew that
Lewinsky had filed a false affidavit denying an affair. If they
both lied, they could steer safely through their depositions, he
reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   But the precise questioning rattled Clinton. And his lawyers
failed to seek a protective order from the federal judge _ who was
in the room and who would later throw out the Lewinsky line of
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton thinks Starr must have been wise to Tripp's Friday
dealings with Jones &AMP; Co. Starr, who could be disbarred for any
such conduct, denies it.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, here are two truths to ponder: The Washington
press corps remains addicted to a sex scandal and most news
consumers could care less about the president's addiction to lying.

 &HT;    ``Blade'' has some sharp karate moves, little else
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH _ Here's how the producers of ``Blade'' have
chosen to hype the film's title character, pulled from the pages of
a lesser-known comic book.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power of an immortal. The soul of a human. The heart of a
hero,'' declares the picture's poster, featuring an armor-suited
Wesley Snipes against a blood-red background.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the makings of another ho-hum summer action
flick.
</P>
<P>
   So far, we've had a lizard that was lifeless (``Godzilla'') and
a meteor shower that was more like a lukewarm bath
(``Armageddon''). Now, we've got vampires who _ guess what? _ come
to suck your blood.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ``Blade'' has a better premise than that. And it's
been a few years since vampires have had a decent turn on screen.
This is a film with potential _ and plasma _ to spare.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that somewhere along the line, ``Blade'' loses sight
of its ambitions and accepts being run-of-the-mill. Vampires take a
back seat to karate matches: Think Vincent Price-meets-Bruce Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The setting is a dark, mysterious urban America, where an
ancient order of vampires has run of the city. Unbeknownst to
average citizens, they control the police, the government and _ of
course _ the blood banks. But the new blood (no pun intended) among
these vampires wants to put an end to the underground trafficking
and control the humans openly and outright. Led by the devil-eyed
Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), they're the Generation X of
blood-suckers.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Blade (Snipes), a half-human, half-vampire who's
determined to put an end to the cult's reign (chalk it up to his
sentimental Homo sapiens side). Honoring the traditions of the
action genre, he's a lean, mean fighting machine, throwing karate
chops here and there and relying upon no small arsenal of weapons.
Frost tries to persuade him to switch sides. Blade, who enlists the
support of an aging male partner (Kris Kristofferson) and an
attractive female hematologist (N'bushe Wright), is determined to
keep fighting the good fight.
</P>
<P>
   And so the fights, captured with a fair deal of computer
animation, are the meat of ``Blade.'' Directed by Stephen
Norrington, the film maintains a nimble pace _ and it's nice to see
action sequences that don't involve ridiculous car chases or
exploding buildings but honest hand-to-hand combat. Still, it's
nothing you're not going to encounter in any B picture from Hong
Kong. As Gertrude Stein might have put it, a karate chop is a
karate chop is a karate chop.
</P>
<P>
   But with its curious premise, Blade deserves better. Here, the
vampires aren't the ghoulish stuff of bad black-and-white movies
but something more sinister and real: They're ``La Cosa Nostra''
with fangs, a society that can conform to the ways of the modern
world but does so only to support its underground activities.
</P>
<P>
   As for the acting, Snipes is his usual commanding presence, but
he tempers the part with a bit of well-placed humor. As a
co-producer responsible for the fight sequences, he deserves some
of the credit for the film's cunning sense of blood sport but also
some of the blame for its emphasis on action above premise. The
rest of the cast handle their two-dimensional roles with a
good-natured grace but not much else. For their sake, let's hope
those paychecks had lots of zeroes.

 &HT;    An old friend who looked up to Clinton only feels let down
 &HT;    By Frank Cerabino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The unimaginable has happened.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton, love him or hate him, has been accused of many
things.
</P>
<P>
   But never this: never giving a short, bad speech.
</P>
<P>
   Words have always saved him, and there was some expectation that
as he addressed the nation Monday night, he'd reach into his
alchemist's bag of oratorical wonder and mint a fresh batch of
golden words to explain his foolish fling with a former White House
intern young enough to be his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   But the unimaginable has happened.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's words failed him.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to believe me.
</P>
<P>
   Just listen to the words of a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like he didn't say anything,'' Tim Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, an investigator for the Palm Beach County State
Attorney's Office, knew Clinton since the days they lived across
the hall from each other at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine isn't a good friend, but he's good enough to have been
invited to the White House a couple times and to have received
personalized Christmas cards from Clinton every year. And he's good
enough to want his old friend to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   But after Monday night, he's not sure that's possible anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine saw too much anger and not enough contrition in
Clinton's words, and saw Clinton's words as a form of piling more
sandbags around the bunker, rather than finding a way to climb out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was up there the end of May, and I spoke to him, he
just felt that (Special Prosecutor Kenneth) Starr was after him,
and that everybody was after him,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyerly vagueness
</P>
<P>
   ``The best policy is to be truthful, but the guy is really
stubborn, he really is,'' Valentine said. ``I was really taken back
by the end of the speech, when he lashed out. Even if Starr was off
the wall and overly aggressive, that wasn't the time to bring it
up. I just write it off to Clinton's stubbornness.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine was hoping that Clinton would have restricted his
emotions Monday to remorse, rather than anger, and that his
powerful passages would have been about his own actions, something
he talked about in vague, lawyerly terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question of getting the sordid details,'' Valentine
said. ``He just needed to show an emotional side. He needed to shed
a tear or bite that lip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was upset by his anger. I just feel that he's not going to
have any power at all from now on. How can you demand respect? You
have to earn it. How can you say, `Follow me,' when you're not a
leader?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Georgetown and Jesuit side of me says don't knock a guy
when he's down, but a psychologist would have fun with him. He's
had several bites of the apple. It's not like he was on a desert
island and happened to bump into this woman.''
</P>
<P>
   In the seven months since the Lewinsky affair became public,
Valentine wanted to believe Clinton, and took heart in the spirited
defense of the president taken by his wife and aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked to read the aides,'' he said. ``The way the aides
were so staunchly attacking Starr, it made me wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   A dimming of the light
</P>
<P>
   But then the way Clinton reversed his public denials with this
brief, combative speech, which talked of ``legally accurate'' yet
misleading words and ``a failure to volunteer information'' only
made Valentine feel worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The language didn't upset me, the level of contrition upset
me,'' Valentine said. ``I realize he was hamstrung with the
language because of his attorneys, but it left you hanging
afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
   To Valentine, Clinton had always been a man with an incredible
aura, a glow that drew you to his light.
</P>
<P>
   But after Monday night, Valentine wondered if his old friend had
begun the gradual process of losing that light.
</P>
<P>
   For Valentine no longer felt drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Just mysteriously suspended.

   IMMUNE-FETUSES _ Georgia researchers have solved a 45-year-old
riddle: why mothers are able to carry babies to term. It's an
ability most people never question. Yet it has puzzled scientists
since 1953, when a British immunologist pointed out that fetuses,
being genetically different from their mothers, should be rejected
by their mothers as foreign tissue _ but they aren't. The discovery
has implications for preventing miscarriages, for treating
autoimmune diseases such as arthritis and lupus and perhaps for
AIDS. The research is in Friday's issue of the journal Science.

 &HT;    Royal Palm pioneers ready to move on
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROYAL PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Jennie Lou Peeples, 47, is about as
Royal Palm Beach as you get. And that holds for the rest of her
kin, 13 of them, all neighbors and all living within blocks of one
another.
</P>
<P>
   And now, says Peeples, the whole family is plotting a mass
exodus from South Florida to the mountains of North Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the very first family to move into Royal Palm Beach,''
Peeples said recently, with a touch of pride, but added a bit
ruefully: ``We never got any recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   I promised the family all the recognition they could stand if
she would explain why in the blue-eyed world the family wants to
swap Paradise for Hicksville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come over to the house for a glass of my Mama's sweet tea, and
we'll talk about it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennie Lou and her sister, Ella Jean Field, 52, grew up in the
three-bedroom, one-bath concrete-block house on Dahlia Drive.
There, on a Sunday afternoon, I was greeted by the sisters and
their parents, Lawton and Verna Lee, and Jennie Lou's daughter,
Gretchen Riddle, 26, and daughter-in-law Jennifer Peeples, 25.
</P>
<P>
   How the Lees came to South Florida is a matter of record. How
they became the first to buy a home in Royal Palm Beach is family
legend.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, Lawton and Verna moved from their birthplace of Perry
in North Florida to Canal Point when Lawton got a job in road
maintenance for the Department of Transportation. In 1951, the job
took them to Loxahatchee.
</P>
<P>
   ``In March 1960,'' volunteered Gretchen, ``Grandpa and his
drinking buddy, Leon, came out and bought the first two houses the
same day. Then they called their friend, Mr. (R.L.) Williams to
come out, and he bought the third house. They've been neighbors
ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawton, comfortably stretched out on his recliner, watching the
stock-car races, nodded genially at this confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Verna furnished details: ``Now Mr. Williams was a teetotaler, so
he hadn't been drinking, but they all did put $200 down on the
first three houses that Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   The Williamses are still next door, and Leon's widow lives just
behind the Lees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payments were $78 a month,'' Lawton added. ``The entire house
cost $9,500.''
</P>
<P>
   (The story was fantastic _ that husbands in their right minds
would buy houses without consulting their wives. ``Well, they just
up and did it,'' reflected Verna, recalling an era when men didn't
tell their wives every little bitty thing.)
</P>
<P>
   Life in the Royal Palm Beach of 1960 was certainly countrified
by today's standards. Folks grew vegetables, dropped in on
neighbors, and hunted and fished almost in their back yards.
Southern Boulevard was two lanes, and Royal Palm Beach Boulevard
was years from connecting north to Okeechobee Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you had,'' recalled Verna, ``was a hardware store and a
7-Eleven on Southern. For your groceries, you had to drive to the
Millers at Four Points on Military Trail.''
</P>
<P>
   The sisters, then 13 and 8, remembered growing up in a
neighborhood where everyone was on a first-name basis. And yet
amenities were not entirely absent. On Southern Boulevard, within
walking distance, was a motel with a restaurant and a pool that was
open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy, tell him about the jailhouse band,'' Ella Jean said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton waved a hand, allowing that she might as well tell it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days,'' Ella Jean said, ``prisoners worked on the
roads. Well, at the road camp, some of the prisoners had a little
band, and Daddy would bring them over to the motel pool to play at
our dances. Can you imagine that today?''
</P>
<P>
   Truthfully, I could not imagine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, you went to jail for stealing candy,'' said Jennie
Lou. ``It's not like now.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it is not like now, and here we come to the crux of why the
daughters and their husbands mean to uproot the entire clan and
light out for the Georgia mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving to Georgia because all the mean people are moving
in to South Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Gretchen, seconded by sister-in-law Jennifer. It was
also, I pointed out, a blanket condemnation of the fine people of
South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like living here anymore,'' Jennie Lou explained,
``because it's changed so much. Our house has been broken into. A
few years ago, Jeannie and I were mugged at the Target up on Palm
Beach Lakes Boulevard _ a couple of kids ripped off our purses.''
</P>
<P>
   Her sister added: ``In the old days, we could trailer our boats
to the ramp at Dreher Park and leave the trailer unattended. Not
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Folks nowadays don't respect property, the sisters added, citing
a new park in Royal Palm Beach already defaced with graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, you can still picnic at DuBois Park, they agreed. Just
send somebody out at 4:30 a.m. to claim a table.
</P>
<P>
   In their travels, family members have scouted a lot of the
country and have fallen in love with the Blairsville, Ga., area,
just south of the North Carolina line. There, a family can wander
the woods without an armed guard. Property is inexpensive, and,
with 10 acres or so, you could have animals, grow some vegetables
and have room for five families.
</P>
<P>
   But is transplanting 13 people a realistic dream? I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our husbands and our son-in-laws are all contractors,'' Ella
Jean said. ``If we can find a piece of property with a couple of
big houses to fix up, we could all go.''
</P>
<P>
   And everybody is up for this?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd leave today, I want to go so bad,'' Gretchen said. ``And
Grandpa would, too. But we're still working on Grandma. She wants
to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really want to go,'' admitted Verna. ``I don't want to
leave my friends, and I don't much care for the cold weather.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, I reminded Verna, she has a history of going along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if my children and grandchildren all moved up to
Georgia, I know I couldn't be satisfied living here without them.
Whether they're ever going to do it or not, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd go,'' Lawton reminded her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' Verna said.

 &HT;    How Wes has won in Hollywood
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the last times Wesley Snipes came through South Florida,
he was in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   A real hurry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the tall, muscular actor was clocked at speeds up to
120 mph driving his motorcycle on Florida's Turnpike, where he was
eventually stopped by state troopers after a 30-mile chase. In
return, he received a reckless driving charge and was sentenced to
80 hours of community service and six months' probation.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far more relaxed Snipes who greeted members of the press
at a swank South Beach club this past weekend. The 36-year-old
movie star, who next to Denzel Washington may be the most bankable
black actor in Hollywood, is in town to promote his latest film,
the vampire-inspired, action-filled ``Blade,'' which opens on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect Snipes, a Florida native, to be one of those
self-important actors who sees a need to justify a film that lacks
much in the way of social statement. He handles inquiries about the
movie's meaning the same way he responds to a question about his
driving habits _ with nothing less than total frankness.
</P>
<P>
   On his driving: ``I haven't been riding (recently) in Florida,''
he says with a knowing laugh, freely adding that he's not about to
slow down when he's out of state. ``That's what the bike is
designed for.''
</P>
<P>
   On the movie: ``It's no profound social commentary,'' he says.
Later, he boils it down to this: ``We're not trying to depict real
life, we're trying to tease and titillate the imagination. . . .
You get your money's worth when you see the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on a comic book, ``Blade'' is a tale of modern-day
vampires. They control all facets of society, from the police to
government, but when push comes to shove, they're still interested
in only one thing: sucking human blood. Their nemesis? A half-man,
half-vampire known as Blade, who's determined to destroy this evil
society before it takes over the world _ and before it turns him
into a pure blood-sucker.
</P>
<P>
   For Snipes, who plays the title character, the film may not be
profound, but it is an important step on the career ladder. After
appearing in nearly 20 movies, playing everything from an architect
who commits adultery (``Jungle Fever'') to an urban drug lord
(``New Jack City'') to a drag queen (``To Wong Foo, Thanks for
Everything! Julie Newmar''), he's finally gotten the chance to
double as actor and co-producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great, man,'' he says, trying his best to look casual as
he sports the bulky armor vest that's Blade's trademark garb. ``You
get an opportunity to have some control over the final product. As
an actor for hire, your job usually ends when they say, `Wrap,
cut.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Snipes' specific contributions to ``Blade'' were the fight
scenes he helped shape and choreograph. Drawing upon his 20-plus
years of training in a variety of martial arts, he says he tried to
make his character a ``modern-day warrior'' who utilizes everything
from ancient sword-fighting techniques to contemporary kick-boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to bring in all the flavors, even the stuff we
learned on the street,'' he says. ``We had scenes where I was
hitting cats with bottles and garbage cans.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Snipes admits he has much to learn about the movie-making
process. Although he talks with confidence about plot and
character, saying ``Blade'' has ``the elements that good American
cinema used to have,'' he's a little more clueless when it comes to
the financial side.
</P>
<P>
   ``My authority didn't extend that far,'' he says. ``I was the
cat who was like, `What do you mean we have to cut a scene?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Blade'' also marks an interesting juncture for Snipes as an
actor. Like Sylvester Stallone, he's clearly in a position to cast
himself as a major action star _ and this film only further cements
that status. But he's got a more meaty dramatic side that he can't
ignore. His previous film was the little noticed ``One Night
Stand,'' directed by Mike Figgis (``Leaving Las Vegas''). His role
as a married man who indulges in a dangerous tryst earned him a
best actor award at the Venice Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   How to account for such a diversity of projects?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just my theater training,'' says Snipes, who moved as a
child from Florida to New York, where he went on to study at the
prestigious High School of Performing Arts. Later, he moved to
Orlando, where he joined a bus-and-truck theater company. ``We
built all the sets, we scripted the whole script and we played all
the characters, so I'm very accustomed to doing that. It's just
fortunate I could do it in film.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Snipes doesn't deny it: He does action films because
that's where the money is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The action films . . . translate internationally and that
broadens your base,'' he explains. ``You can pre-sell a movie now
on your foreign appeal. That makes your pockets fat.''
</P>
<P>
   And what does Snipes do with all his money, other than buy
speedy motorcycles?
</P>
<P>
   Well, he maintains residences in Los Angeles and New York. But
his favorite home may be the 7,000-square-foot, multimillion-dollar
mansion he built in a gated community outside Orlando, the city
where much of his family still lives. ``Cafe Wes'' is what Snipes
calls the none-too-simple spread, a place where he can relax with
friends and relatives (he also has an 8-year-old son from a
marriage that ended in divorce).
</P>
<P>
   As for his next project, Snipes remains undecided. He wants to
produce and star in a film about jazz great Miles Davis, an idol of
his. He's also been rumored to be up for the role of Sammy Davis
Jr. in Martin Scorsese's delayed picture about the Rat Pack. And
there's always the possibility of a ``Blade 2,'' since the movie
ends on a somewhat enigmatic note.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, says Snipes, is you can't predict where his
career will take him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to do a musical, that would be another thing that
people would never have expected me to do,'' he concludes. ``The
objective is to keep mixing it up.''

 &HT;    ``Bogus'' Boxtops?
 &HT;    By Pat Moore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STUART, Fla. _ One group labels itself the Boxtops. Another, the
Box Tops.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is anything but subtle to members of the original
1960s music group _ the one with two words in its name _ who have
taken the copycat group to court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a completely bogus act,'' Rick Levy, manager of the
original Box Tops, said recently. ``That group has no members who
were with the original group. Lenny Longo was never in the group,
never performed and never recorded with the original Box Tops.''
</P>
<P>
   Longo's group is scheduled to appear Friday night at the Lyric
Theatre, where managers were surprised to hear the group coming to
Stuart is not the one that recorded such hits as The Letter and Cry
Like a Baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all new to us,'' Lucy Corley, the Lyric's executive
director, said Wednesday. ``We didn't intend to fool anybody and
had we known about it we wouldn't have booked them.''
</P>
<P>
   Longo claims he has the legal right to use the name and has done
so worldwide for years. He said he never intended to mislead
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our name is not even spelled the same as theirs,'' Longo said.
``We don't claim to be the original group. We're an oldies act, a
show with songs from the '50s to the '70s and a little bit of
comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Longo said Wednesday he was dismayed to learn fliers promoting
the Stuart show stated the ``Boxtops'' will be ``Performing their
hit song, The Letter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I've been trying to take that out (of publicity) for
years and it keeps resurfacing. It should not have been worded that
way and no one cleared it with me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The real duel between both groups eventually may be played out
in federal court in Tennessee, where the original group has sued
Longo and his former agent who obtained the group's trademark in
1983.
</P>
<P>
   The original Box Tops bass player, Bill Cunningham, said
founders of the group split up in 1970 and got back together after
he contacted them in 1996. The original group recently finished a
new album that has been released in Europe and should be offered in
this country in a few weeks, their agent Rick Levy of Orlando said.
</P>
<P>
   Another original player, guitarist Gary Talley, said another
group using the group's name also has surfaced in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to put these fake Box Tops out of business,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham said other groups such as the Coasters, Drifters and
Platters have had other artists using their names over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it all occurs from us not being around for all these
years and people liked the music and stepped in to make money,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham and Talley said their suit, filed in U.S. District
Court in Nashville last year, accuses a Philadelphia agency of
fraudulently obtaining the group's name by falsely stating on the
trademark application they had used the name since 1967.
</P>
<P>
   They also have filed a petition with the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office asking them to cancel the trademark obtained by
the agency.
</P>
<P>
   But Longo and his agent, Richard Lustig of Orlando, said they
believe the agency obtained the trademark legally since the
original members abandoned it when they disbanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is Lenny (Longo) legally owns the name,''
Lustig said. ``I've been booking Lenny for 10 years. He puts on an
excellent show. The people will walk away entertained.''
</P>
<P>
   Corley hopes so, but said money would be refunded to disgruntled
ticket buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get involved in who's who, but I'm not going
to give people money back unless they want it,'' she said. ``We're
going to have a good time. People will be dancing in the aisles.''

 &HT;    Sentinel chickens give signs of Florida encephalitis
 &HT;    By Mary Warejcka
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two chickens have tested positive for St. Louis encephalitis in
a preliminary screening _ this year's first signs of the
potentially dangerous virus in Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the two chickens housed west of Boca Raton and West Palm
Beach have the virus won't be known for sure until a second screen
is completed in late August. The chickens are called ``sentinel
chickens'' because they alert people that night-feeding mosquitoes
are spreading the virus, which can sicken and even kill people.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they test positive the second time, two positives
wouldn't be enough to issue warnings, said Jim Jolley,
environmental health administrator for the county Health
Department. Still, it's always a good idea to avoid exposure to
mosquitoes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might not be of much concern,'' Jolley said recently.
``We'll just have to wait and see.'' Nearby, Jolley said, Hendry
County has also had one chicken testing positive, but there have
been none in Indian River County _ where birds began showing signs
of the virus in June last year. Statewide, dry weather has helped
cut down on the number of mosquitoes that could spread the disease.
If rain continues, there will be more mosquitoes that could be
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The first positive tests in Palm Beach County come a couple
weeks earlier than they did last year, when an encephalitis scare
led to temporary and unpopular bans on many nighttime activities
such as school football games.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, state health officials declared a 10-week medical
alert that included Palm Beach, Martin, St. Lucie, Okeechobee and
23 other Florida counties. Nine human cases _ including one in
Belle Glade and a Hillsborough County man who died _ were confirmed
in Florida.

 &HT;    Tale of infidelities intelligent, disturbing
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Neil LaBute is at it again, stirring up
trouble exploring relations between the sexes, and not finding much
hope for peaceful coexistence. There is a clear link between ``Your
Friends &AMP; Neighbors'' and filmmaker LaBute's debut feature, ``In
the Company of Men.'' Both are unflinching, pessimistic looks at
gender skirmishes, pitch-dark comedies designed to leave an
audience unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   While it was relatively easy to dismiss ``In the Company of
Men'' as a story of the mean-spirited prank of two jerks toying
with the emotions of a hearing-impaired secretary, ``Your Friends &AMP;
Neighbors'' is considerably harder to shake off. This time around,
LaBute wants to broaden his aim, involving and indicting us all.
</P>
<P>
   He focuses on six upwardly mobile thirtysomethings _ longtime
friends, lovers, marriage partners and new acquaintances _ whose
equilibriums are shattered by infidelity. You may not like these
people, but, chances are, you'll find yourself identifying with
some of them. Or being reminded of the equally lost souls of
``Carnal Knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry (Ben Stiller) is a self-absorbed college drama teacher,
the sort you expect to take advantage of some young coed who hangs
on his every word. Instead, after we've heard his longtime live-in
lover Terri (Catherine Keener) rant that he never shuts up,
particularly in bed, Jerry reaches out to her friend Mary (Amy
Brenneman), confessing a long-held desire for an affair with her.
Stuck in an emotionally empty marriage with Barry (Aaron Eckhart,
the prime heel of ``In the Company of Men''), Mary crosses the line
with Jerry with extremely unsatisfying results and repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Cary (Jason Patric), a most unfeeling sexual
predator, whom we first see practicing and refining his bedroom
patter into a tape recorder. And Cheri (Nastassja Kinski), a
flirtatious art gallery manager who takes up with the wounded
Terri. There are further links to this rambunctious sexual daisy
chain, but you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute's script crackles with frank dialogue and observant
little cruelties. Although he clearly has more resources than he
did for the shoestring ``In the Company of Men,'' he continues to
keep his camera in tight, far more interested in his characters
than background atmosphere. Some may find his approach static and
stagy, but the quality of his writing transcends such quibbles.
</P>
<P>
   All of this, of course, could play as soap opera, but the
uniformly razor-sharp and realistic performances of the ensemble
cast keep the movie from slipping into such shallow waters. Patric,
who also co-produced, is unflinching as cold-blooded Cary,
particularly riveting with a monologue recalling a homosexual rape.
Eckhart shows his range, in marked contrast to ``Company of Men,''
expressing the character's dissatisfaction and self-loathing.
</P>
<P>
   Keener walks a tightrope, managing to be sympathetically bitchy,
and Brenneman conveys great wells of sorrow in her mournful eyes.
In a clever series of parallel encounters, Kinski controls her art
gallery turf, using her wiles to manipulate all who enter her lair.
</P>
<P>
   Though it will leave some viewers feeling unsatisfied, LaBute
refuses to let them off the hook at the end. This, he is saying, is
the state of relationships in the late '90s. You want a happy
ending? Go see a Disney cartoon.

 &HT;    Lunch Box Battle
 &HT;    By Jennifer White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back to school battles are all too common among kids and their
parents. What clothes to buy and which school supplies are
necessary are issues that parent and child generally don't see
eye-to-eye on, but the lunch box battle _ convincing kids to eat
healthy foods when all they want are sweets _ is one of the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George Freeman packs lunches daily for his kids, Michael, 8,
and Magen, 6, and he understands the importance of eating
nutritiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kind of give it to them, it's part of a meal,''
Freeman said about how he and his wife, Heather, encourage their
children to include fruits and vegetables in their lunch boxes.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of 500 parents of elementary-age school children,
conducted by Impulse Research Corp. in June, more than half of
parents (60 percent) disagree with their children over what to pack
in the lunchbox and 70 percent of parents are concerned that their
kids are eating snacks that aren't nutritious.
</P>
<P>
   Michael and Magen, both students at Oakwood, don't have the
option of dining from a school cafeteria, so they bring their lunch
from home. The Freemans are pretty well-rounded eaters, so school
lunches usually consist of sandwiches, fresh fruit and one treat
for dessert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let them make choices at the grocery store so that they're
not surprised with what we pack in their lunch,'' Freeman said.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Weston, a parenting expert and author, says that kids
appreciate being part of the decision-making process. For example,
when packing a lunch, ask, ``Do you want carrot sticks or celery
sticks?'' and offer snack choices. If kids have a hand in what goes
in the lunch bag, they are more likely to eat those foods _rather
than trade them away.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being good eaters, the Freemans do enjoy their share of
junk food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magen would eat chips and candy all day if we would let her,''
Freeman said. Compromises include packing one treat and choosing
healthier foods for lunches that the kids actually enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both like fresh-sliced meat, so sliced turkey is a source
of protein they eat a great deal of,'' Freeman said. Michael and
Magen also take milk in their thermoses as a source of calcium.
</P>
<P>
   Although some children run in the opposite direction when they
hear the word ``healthy'' attached to a food, Freeman said that
there are nutritious foods available that actually taste good to
kids. He recommends packing left-over foods in kids' lunches,
including pizza, spaghetti and meatloaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's generally a lot better than the things you buy in the
grocery store,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman also encourages parents to continue to pack nutritious
lunches for their kids, despite what they may see other children
eating at school.
</P>
<P>
   Michael has questioned why other kids bring soft drinks for
lunch, but the Freeman's limit such items to weekends and special
occasions so that they don't become a staple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them in order to grow and be healthy, they need to eat
a wide variety of foods,'' Freeman said.
</P>
<P>
   Setting an example is the hardest thing about getting kids to
eat healthy, Freeman said. ``If your kids see you snack on candy
bars and chips all the time, they're not likely to listen to you
when you say how important it is to eat carrot sticks and
whole-wheat bread.''
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR: Nutrition-packed foods to pack
</P>
<P>
   GRAINS: low fat muffins, bagels, whole wheat grain breads and
rolls, pita bread, low fat crackers, bread sticks, cereals
</P>
<P>
   FRUITS: bananas, grapes, apples, cut-up oranges, melons,
peaches, pineapple, kiwi (in small plastic container, already
peeled) ... you may need to limit juice
</P>
<P>
   VEGETABLES: carrots, celery sticks, broccoli, cauliflower
flowerets, cuke slices, jicama sticks, lettuce on sandwiches
</P>
<P>
   DAIRY: string cheese, low-fat cheese slices, low-fat yogurt
</P>
<P>
   PROTEIN: nut butters, sunflower seeds, tofu
</P>
<P>
   MIXED: soup, leftover pizza, sandwiches

 &HT;    Best of Friends
 &HT;    By Kim Grizzard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ When Sara comes to visit, she's like one of
the family.
</P>
<P>
   Nannie Lee Cox is happy to see her. She smiles sweetly and
extends her hand, touching Sara's face gently and telling her how
lovely she looks.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing Sara brings back memories that, for a moment, make her
sad, even homesick.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in my life I didn't have a dog or
cat,'' Cox says. ``I had a dog all my life until I come here.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is the Alzheimer's unit of the Carolina House, a Greenville
long-term care facility. Probably the last place you'd expect to
find two pit bulls.
</P>
<P>
   But here they are, lapping up all the attention they're getting.
Sara and Skibo are working the crowd, licking hands and posing for
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me there's something about a cat or dog that's
family,'' Cox says. ``If it won't (against policy), I'd sneak one
in.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sara and Skibo haven't been smuggled in under somebody's
coat. They are guests, invited by Betsy Jones, activities director
at the facility.
</P>
<P>
   The Carolina House soon plans to have live-in pets like its
sister facility in western North Carolina. More nursing homes and
other facilities are rethinking standard no-pets policies in favor
of an approach that recognizes the potential benefits of human and
animal contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, we have more families now who are bringing people's
pets in,'' says Amy Beach, recreation services director at
Greenville Villa, where one aim of animal visits is to give the
facility a more homelike atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a growing trend in that direction, making it (the
facility) as homey as possible,'' says Sandra Triebenbacher, an
assistant professor in the Department of Child Development and
Family Relations at East Carolina University.
</P>
<P>
   Triebenbacher is one of four people in the state certified to
evaluate animals through the Pet Partners Program. The program,
established in 1990 by the Delta Society, has established
guidelines for animals used in therapy and visitation programs.
</P>
<P>
   Drake Parker, owner and head trainer at Top Dog Academy, has had
his American pit bull terriers certified as Pet Partners. Now Sara
and Skibo can accompany him on visits to schools, nursing homes and
day care centers.
</P>
<P>
   The breed, which has been linked with dog fights and other
aggression in the public perception, is not always a welcome sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I do get looks,'' Parker admits. Because he has not
cut his dogs' ears or tails, customary for pit bulls, they look
more like the beloved pooch of ``The Little Rascals'' than the
fighting breed often depicted in the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception is definitely wrong,'' Parker says. ``If you
sit here and watch my dogs for a little while, you might just
change your mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much a breed thing as it is the owner. I've been
around them (pit bulls) since I was a kid, and I know what the
truth is.''
</P>
<P>
   Stereotypes don't seem to mean much at the Carolina House, where
nobody seems to care that they're petting pit bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're beautiful,'' Martha Stang says, admiring Sara and
Skibo. ``They're the kind of dogs you'd be proud to have.''
</P>
<P>
   The Delta Society isn't concerned about breeds either. That is
not taken into consideration during Pet Partners certification.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most important things that we are taught as we go
through the evaluator process is that we don't even take breeds
into consideration,'' Triebenbacher says. ``We look at every single
individual animal and their handler.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of his (Parker's) pit bulls are so laid-back and
easy-going. Pit bulls, certainly, and rottweilers have had real bad
raps. Every dog has potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Even strays and mixed-breeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably in this country there are more mixed breeds that are
involved in this type of activity,'' Triebenbacher says.
</P>
<P>
   Triebenbacher's dog, Scruffy, a terrier mix, is a Pet Partner,
as is Suzie, a border collie. She's working to teach a third, Sam,
a lab-chow mix and a stray, so he can join her on visits to schools
and nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   In schools, the dogs are teaching props.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to one preschool classroom, and there was a child who
had some challenges with biting,'' Triebenbacher recalls. ``When he
would get very angry and frustrated, he would bite. Interestingly
enough, of all the things about Suzie (her dog), he was most
intrigued by her teeth. This was a real teachable moment to talk
about what we use our teeth for.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit to preschoolers in the Child Development
Laboratory at East Carolina University, children asked questions
about dogs biting and licking. But mostly, they just wanted to
touch them.
</P>
<P>
   Touching pets and communicating with them has been shown to
lower blood pressure and increase longevity. Additional studies are
exploring a connection between contact with animals and decreased
depression, isolation and loneliness.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Sometimes) patients ... have decided they're not going to
talk and they're not going to interact with anyone, and all of a
sudden an animal comes into the room and they say 'puppy,' and they
haven't spoken a word in 10 days,'' Triebenbacher says. ``That's an
exciting thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol King, food service director at Greenville Villa, noticed
some pretty remarkable reactions from patients when she started
bringing her Chihuahua, Lucy, to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband found (Lucy). She was abandoned,'' King says. ``We
started pet therapy after that. They ask me all the time since I
work out here, 'When's Lucy coming back?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially the ones with Alzheimer's disease, they perk up.
They definitely want to to touch them and talk to them. Quite a few
of them have surprised me.''
</P>
<P>
   King invited her neighbor, Mary Snow Harriss, to bring her dogs
_ all five of them _ out for visits.
</P>
<P>
   Greenville Villa resident Lonnie Turner seldom misses the chance
to see the dogs, especially Tylullah, a poodle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to see them come,'' she says. ``If I don't come, they
take them to my room.''
</P>
<P>
   Gigi Walter brings her two poodles, Oodi and Tevi, out as well.
Together, the seven or eight dogs stand on a table in the activity
room where residents take turns petting them, holding them and
feeding them doggy treats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love dogs,'' Walter explains, ``and I like sharing my
puppies with someone else who has loved dogs all their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Harriss says her dogs benefit from the experience as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine usually come in for the group,'' she says. ``This is the
highlight of their whole lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Tylullah, there's Darby (a Pomeranian), Bridget (a Shih
Tzu), Charlotte (a Pekingese) and Annie (an English Springer
Spaniel). They range in age from 6 to 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of my dogs needed homes,'' Harriss says. ``These are dogs
people didn't want.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenville Villa residents find that hard to imagine as they
stroke, brush and hug the dogs Harriss adopted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are residents of this nursing home who have pictures of
my dog next to pictures of their grandchildren,'' Harriss says.
``They love them.''

 &HT;    Weird weather taking US by storm
 &HT;    By Dale Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The Miami Valley may be enjoying a mild
summer, but some of the odd twists and turns elsewhere have fired
up the debate over global warming. In fact, there have been so many
strange weather events this year that 1998 may go down as the year
of the calamity.
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   Prudhoe Bay, which lies near the Arctic Circle in Alaska,
recorded a 54 degree day in May, breaking the previous record by 8
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Heatwaves of 100 degree-plus temperatures blasted Texas and
Oklahoma for weeks, causing 100 deaths and $1.7 billion in
agricultural losses.
</P>
<P>
   Floods tore through the Midwest in the spring, causing 63
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfires scorched Florida in May and June, as 80 percent of the
state was at a drought level equivalent to a desert.
</P>
<P>
   July's average worldwide temperature was the warmest since
instrumental records have been kept (1880), about one degree
Fahrenheit above the long-term mean.
</P>
<P>
   Those and other oddities were documented by an August report by
the Sierra Club. The environmental group sees such extreme
conditions as a sign that the output from mankind's smokestacks and
automobiles, the so-called greenhouse gases, is increasing the
temperature of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists are telling us that global warming means more
extreme weather,'' said Dan Becker, the Sierra Club's Global
Warming and Energy Program Director. ``The weather is telling us
that global warming has begun.''
</P>
<P>
   It is far from a settled question. The climate of the earth is
so complex, dependent on so many changing factors like heat, air
and moisture, that the most powerful supercomputers can only
approximate its effects using bare-bones models for predictions.
There is widespread consensus among the world's scientists,
however, on the existence of the ``greenhouse effect,'' that rising
carbon dioxide levels create a canopy over the earth, trapping warm
air and raising its temperature. The warmest global temperatures of
the last 600 years have been recorded in the last decade, and some
scientists expect another two- to six-degree rise in the next 100
years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some people argue that global warming is a myth, and that
temperature readings from satellites actually show a slight
cooling. Industry groups have mounted an intense campaign to
Congress against the stricter, potentially expensive environmental
goals set at a conference in Kyoto, Japan, last December. The
conference called on industrialized nations to roll back the
release of fossil fuel-generated greenhouse gases to 1990 levels.
</P>
<P>
   If the earth is warming _ and it would take only one or two
degrees to see drastic shifts in the climate and environment _ the
Dayton area could be altered dramatically. A recent analysis
conducted by the Environmental Defense Fund claims that the Miami
Valley could see two times as many days over 90 degrees in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis placed Dayton 17th on the list of U.S. cities that
would likely experience warmer temperatures. Miami topped the list,
going from an average of 23 days over 90 degrees to 98.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's devastating heat waves in cities across the nation
may provide a picture of a typical summer of the future unless
emissions of greenhouse gases are significantly reduced,'' said
Janine Bloomfield, a scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund,
a New York-based not-for-profit organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dayton averaged only 12 days over 90 degrees per year between
1979 and 1997,'' she said. ``Our analysis shows that without
greenhouse gas controls, 20 to as many as 47 days over 90 degrees
per year can be expected by the year 2100.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis is based on the range of findings of the United
Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The study used
historical data from the National Center for Atmospheric Research
and ran the averages through a computer model for climate change by
the year 2100.
</P>
<P>
   A warmer Miami Valley wasn't evident this year, however. Summer
temperatures for the most part have hovered at or just below
normal. June and July were below normal, according the the National
Weather Service in Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   It has been wetter, thanks to the two or three thunderstorms
that swept through the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't really had a big hot spell,'' said Jim Lott, a
meteorologist at the National Weather Service. ``Actually, this
summer pretty much did the opposite of what we thought. We thought
it was going to be hot and dry.''
</P>
<P>
   The more extreme effects of El Nino, the weather-disrupting
current of warm water in the Pacific, generally missed Ohio.
January and February were the warmest in the state since records
started being kept 103 years ago. There was a freaky snowfall in
Cincinnati on Feb. 4 that dropped 12 inches in 24 hours, while
Dayton received a scant 1.5 inches. Lake Erie made it through
February without freezing, according to the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   Floods ravaged the Ohio River and central part of the state.
``But that's pretty typical for spring,'' said Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Other areas of the country were hit harder.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California was hit with 21 inches of rain in February.
The wet conditions created a bumper crop of rodents, rattlesnakes
and insects. Texas had over 15 straight days of temperatures over
100 degrees, hitting a record of 113 on July 14. While Florida
suffered a drought, South Carolina had its wettest winter ever,
receiving 36 inches from November 1997 to April 1998.

   RATPACK _ HBO airs ``The Rat Pack,'' a film where none of the
stars really look like Sinatra or Dino or Sammy _ but it grows on
you anyway. It scores big. (Jubera, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   TV-SURFER _ The first, and some say the best, new series (though
that's debatable) of the fall season _ airs Sunday. It's ``That
'70s Show'' on Fox _ and full of jokes about disco, Vienna
sausages, smoking dope, bell bottoms and Todd Rundgren. It's
definitely not a sitcom for everybody _ but aging baby boomers will
likely get a kick out of it. Also debuting Sunday _ ``Holding The
Baby.'' In a few quick words: it's particularly awful; short quotes

Another, the Box Tops. The difference is anything but subtle to
members of the original 1960s music group _ the one with two words

   BLADE _ WEST PALM BEACH _ Here's how the producers of ``Blade''
have chosen to hype the film's title character, pulled from the
pages of a lesser-known comic book. ``The power of an immortal. The
soul of a human. The heart of a hero,'' declares the picture's
poster, featuring an armor-suited Wesley Snipes against a blood-red

 &HT;    Adelphia cable lets its fingers do walking into phone service
 &HT;    By Michael Utley and Marguerite M. Plunkett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Adelphia Communications, a local cable
TV company, is planning to offer local phone service at the
burgeoning Abacoa development in Jupiter as early as next month,
making it the first cable operator in Palm Beach County and the
Treasure Coast to challenge BellSouth Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Adelphia is testing the service now and expects to make it
available to the entire 2,050-acre Abacoa development, which is
being built north of Donald Ross Road and west of Alternate A1A,
the company's regional manager, Mark Galloway, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where it will start,'' Galloway said. ``We're in the
technical stages of getting it to work.''
</P>
<P>
   An exact launch date and pricing details have not been
determined, he said. Adelphia now offers its customers
long-distance phone service in several package deals with rates
averaging about 10 cents a minute. But Adelphia is reselling
long-distance time it buys in bulk from the major long-distance
companies. Its local service would be routed through the company's
cable lines before tying into the BellSouth network.
</P>
<P>
   Adelphia also provides high-speed Internet access for $34.95 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Abacoa development, which has about 130 homes
so far, Adelphia has more than 330,000 cable TV subscribers in Palm
Beach, Martin and St. Lucie counties.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth, by far the largest local phone service provider in
Florida, said Wednesday that it welcomes the competition from
Adelphia and others. BellSouth, which has just a few local service
competitors that target business customers, said Adelphia's move
bolsters its argument that the Atlanta-based phone giant should be
allowed to compete for long-distance customers. Regulators have
blocked that request on more than one occasion.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's bid to break into the $70 billion-a-year
long-distance market hit another roadblock Wednesday when the U.S.
Justice Department urged federal regulators to turn down the
company's request.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers said BellSouth should not be allowed
to provide long-distance service in Louisiana because it has not
sufficiently opened its local phone market to rivals _ a condition
for entering the long-distance business. The Federal Communications
Commission ultimately will decide the matter. The law requires the
FCC to make a decision by Oct. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Adelphia's decision to offer local phone service in Jupiter is
``another example of how local facility-based phone competition is
growing in the area,'' said Rob Seitz, a BellSouth spokesman in
West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is healthy for the telecommunications industry and will
result in better prices and services to customers,'' Seitz said.
``It is also an excellent example of BellSouth being singled out in
Florida as the only phone company that cannot provide long-distance
service, and that needs to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Other local cable companies _ including Comcast, Tele-Media and
Time Warner in the Glades _ are expected to offer phone service in
the near future. MediaOne cable company started selling local phone
service on Monday in Broward County, where Comcast also has a
limited service area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in everybody's future plans,'' said Robert Shock, a vice
president in Tele-Media's Boynton Beach office. ``We're doing
feasibility studies on it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress opened local phone service to competition two years ago
with the passage of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, but other
companies have been slow to take on the Baby Bells. Some, like
AT&AMP;T, have found that reselling time bought from the Baby Bells was
a losing proposition.

 &HT;    New plant would sell its energy wholesale
 &HT;    By John Murawski
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy is
pushing ahead with a proposal to build a power plant near Daytona
Beach and adjacent to Florida Power &AMP; Light Co.'s service area,
according to a petition filed recently at the Public Service
Commission in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   Duke wants to build the state's first merchant plant, which
would sell wholesale low-cost electricity to other utilities in the
state. But the state's major utilities _ FPL, Tampa Electric Co.
and St. Petersburg-based Florida Power Corp. _ oppose Duke's plans.
</P>
<P>
   This is Duke's second application to build the 500 megawatt
gas-powered plant in New Smyrna Beach by 2001. Duke dropped last
year's effort to avoid hearings on its eligibility. This time
around, Duke is asking the PSC to say that growing energy
consumption in the state justifies the construction of a new plant,
a tack that requires fewer hearings. Duke points to this summer's
peak energy demands as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Duke is faced with the predicament of trying to build a power
plant in Florida at a time when there is yet no provision for
deregulation, and utilities such as FPL are citing those rules
against Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, to get permission from state regulators to build a
plant, the utility has to justify passing on the construction
expenses to its Florida ratepayers, or customers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Duke plant doesn't fit that pattern because it wouldn't
have any ratepayers. It would sell to other utilities. Duke says
it, not customers, is paying the $160 million bill.
</P>
<P>
   FPL says there is nothing in Florida law that allows a company
to build a plant whose primary purpose is to make spare energy as a
wholesale business venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duke's proposal circumvents state policy,'' said a statement
from FPL. ``No utility in Florida would be allowed to build this
plant because it exceeds any demonstrated need for electricity.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke's proposed 500 megawatt plant would generate enough power
to serve about 150,000 homes. FPL's St. Lucie Nuclear Plant
generates 1,553 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 megawatts of the proposed plant's output would go to
the Utilities Commission of the City of New Smyrna Beach, which has
20,000 retail customers in the area where Duke wants to build. The
other 470 megawatts would be up for grabs to any utility that wants
to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   There is no obligation for anyone to buy the power. But Duke
says it's confident today's critics will become tomorrow's
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be cheaper _ or we won't sell any power,'' said Duke's
energy lawyer in Tallahassee, Scheffel Wright. ``Once the plant is
built and producing power and selling at less than some utilities
are generating from their own older power plants, they'll say, 'I
guess this is the best deal for our ratepayers.' ``
</P>
<P>
   FPL, which has plants around the country that sell energy to
other utilities, says that granting approval would open the
floodgates to similar applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the proposal was approved, speculative power generators
could dot the state, taking up valuable land, consuming state
resources and adding unnecessary pollution,'' FPL said in its
statement.
</P>
<P>
   FPL said it doesn't have any merchant plants in the country. The
Juno Beach-based company's power projects around the country sell
energy to other utilities under long-term contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Merchant plants typically have few or no long-term contracts,
and make money by selling lower than the going daily wholesale
energy rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever we do in states elsewhere we're doing under the laws
of that state,'' said FPL spokesman Dale Thomas. ``It's not the
same thing (as Duke's application).''

</P>
<P>
   ``Disgusting. A disgrace. They should have fired him. We coulda

</P>
<P>
   The joke clarifies the predictable mini-controversy over merely
suspending Barnicle for cribbing one-liners, after sacking Globe
columnist Patricia Smith for inventing sources and quotes
wholesale.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the degrees of the two misdemeanors, there is a
marketplace force at work here. Defenders of Smith are free to
publish a newspaper with the motto ``47 clever people quoted in
this paper do not exist'' and defenders of Barnicle can say ``Our
columnists don't tell where they heard their jokes.'' At the end of
the day, the publisher who sells the most papers is the winner.
</P>
<P>
   (Add 1) Thursday. Wow, times change. Barnicle's history, unless

paper leap with an offer? Only without looking. Sorry, Mike, but

HUMBLE SUTTER HOME SUBTLY SHAPES AMERICA'S WINE INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL FRANSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ You won't read much about Sutter Home in snooty
wine magazines, but the winery best known for inventing the fruity
white zinfandel has had a huge impact on the wine business. The
family-owned, $300-million Napa Valley company has quietly become
the fourth-largest winery in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sutter Home helped make wine accessible to the average consumer
through savvy marketing of varietal wines at affordable prices. Its
sweet pink white zinfandel challenges chardonnay as America's
best-selling varietal wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sutter Home had an immense impact on the industry,'' said Cary
Gott, former senior vice president of production for Seagram
Chateau &AMP; Estates Wine Co.'s California wines (Mumm Napa, Sterling
and Monterey Vineyards), who now runs the Gott Group in Calistoga.
</P>
<P>
   While Sutter Home specializes in inexpensive varietal wines that
sell for $3.49 to $5.99 per bottle, its success has resulted from
marketing innovation as much as from wine. It was the first winery
in Napa Valley to offer free samples to visitors, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a driving force behind making premium varietal wines
popular in the United States,'' notes Jean-Michel Valette, senior
analyst and wine specialist at Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, the investment
bank that took both Robert Mondavi Co. and Beringer Wine Estates
public.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Sutter Home's marketing innovations are aimed at
stealing customers from Anheuser-Busch and Coca-Cola, not Mondavi
or Beringer.
</P>
<P>
   It innovated supermarket promotion of wine, placing its
stand-alone displays prominently in the aisles, and was the first
in the United States to package wine in traditional-looking, small
bottles for individual consumption at home. And it has expanded the
market by introducing nonalcoholic and low-alcohol wines.
</P>
<P>
   Sutter also spends about $8 million per year on television
advertising aimed at demystifying wine and encouraging people to
think of wine as part of a healthy meal.
</P>
<P>
   Piedmont, Italy-born John Trinchero, who moved to the Napa
Valley from New York in 1947, bought the abandoned Sutter Home
winery near St. Helena and started the business. His brother,
Mario, soon joined him.
</P>
<P>
   The winery was a modest affair. Bob Trinchero joined the winery
in 1958 after a stint in the Air Force and succeeded his uncle John
as winemaker. He jokes that they sold 52 different wines _ all from
the same two red and white tanks. In 1960, John sold his share to
Mario, who turned the operation over to his children.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, hoping to improve the winery's reputation, Bob
Trinchero decided to focus on zinfandel. The wines received good
reviews, but the winery continued to struggle. That changed when he
accidentally developed white zinfandel in 1972. Originally a
byproduct when Trinchero drained off part of the juice in making
regular zinfandel to concentrate its flavor, the castoff evolved
into today's popular white zin.
</P>
<P>
   The industry ships about 21 million cases of white zinfandel
each year, 4 million from Sutter Home.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Trinchero is now chairman and chief executive, but focuses
on vineyards and production, while Roger Trinchero serves as
president of the winery and drives marketing and sales. Sister Vera
Trinchero Torres is secretary of the corporation.
</P>
<P>
   White zinfandel is the ultimate cash flow wine: It's easy to
produce, requires no aging, and begins generating revenue a few
months after harvest.
</P>
<P>
   The Trincheros have used this cash to build an empire. They own
270 acres in Napa Valley, plus three production facilities. Their
old winery serves as a tasting room.
</P>
<P>
   They also own 6,000 acres of vineyards around the state, much of
it organically farmed. Still, the Trincheros must sometimes feel
the sting of wine snobs. Recently, they hired Derek Holstein, the
respected winemaker from Guenoc Winery in Middletown, Calif., and
introduced a separate high-end brand called M. Trinchero in honor
of their father, Mario. The $30 cabernet and chardonnay have been
getting good reviews.

SAN FRANCISCO TO ALLOW SOME ACCESS TO TREASURE ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHUCK FINNIE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayor Willie Brown, under pressure to loosen his
grip on control of Treasure Island, is ready to budge and allow the
public to visit the former naval base on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the policy shift, Annemarie Conroy, Brown's chief
aide for Treasure Island, said, ``People are curious about Treasure
Island. They want to enjoy the beautiful vistas of San Francisco.
We think that is important.''
</P>
<P>
   The new public access plan, which Conroy outlined Wednesday for
the Treasure Island Development Authority, a governing board
appointed by the mayor, is tentative because it must be approved by
the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Though the city manages the base, located in the San Francisco
Bay, Treasure Island Naval Station remains federal property until a
sale to San Francisco is negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Under the public-access proposal, visitors would have weekend
run of the Great Lawn, located on the base's western shore, and
nearby grounds from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. after Labor Day through early
November, weather permitting.
</P>
<P>
   Conroy said the mayor's office is counting on corporate
sponsorship to pay the $30,000 cost of fencing off the visiting
area and for the necessary addition of police, fire and sanitation
services.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings from a Labor Day weekend blues and arts festival at
Treasure Island, an event announced Tuesday by the mayor, also
would be available, Conroy said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the mayor's administration of Treasure Island
applauded Brown's policy shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is great,'' said city Supervisor Tom Ammiano. ``He
is a little late. The train already left the station, but it's good
he's on board.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the mayor's plan, 160 parking spaces would be provided on
a first-come basis.
</P>
<P>
   Conroy's presentation came a day after Supervisor Michael Yaki
broke ranks with Brown and announced he would introduce legislation
to wrest from the mayor some of his control over the base.
</P>
<P>
   Yaki wants some members of the Board of Supervisors to have
seats on the development authority. The authority directs
conversion of the base to civilian residential, commercial and
recreational uses.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Yaki helped defeat another supervisor's bid
to implement a June ballot measure, passed by city voters, that
called for dissolving the development authority.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Leland Yee, backed by Ammiano, wanted to replace the
Brown-controlled authority with one dominated by supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   Both Yee and Ammiano are likely to support Yaki's move to at
least give supervisors a voice in base redevelopment decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I will vote for that,'' Yee said. ``It's not exactly
what I wanted, but it's a lot better than what exists now.''

HITTING BOTTOM WITH CLINTON BLAH-BLAH-BLAH 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Among my pals who are recovering alcoholics or
drug addicts, most can tell of a defining moment when they came
face-to-face with their out-of-control behavior and knew something
had to change.
</P>
<P>
   In Alcoholics Anonymous, it's called hitting bottom.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the moment came courtesy of a drunken-driving arrest
or being fired. For others, the messenger was more subtle: a
glimpse in a brightly-lighted mirror, a crushing remark from a
beloved child, the very last friend who said, ``No, no more
money.''
</P>
<P>
   The point is, in the moment, the addict got a clean, clear look
at just how much of a mess his life was, just how low she had sunk.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, about 20 minutes after the president's short
mea-sort-of-culpa to the nation, I experienced a similar moment. It
wasn't around the abuse of alcohol or drugs but around another kind
of addiction.
</P>
<P>
   I do not recall which network I was watching or which anchorman
was asking questions. Having exhausted the obvious subjects for
criticism, speculation and prediction, the anchor turned to Clinton
biographer and Washington Post reporter David Maraniss.
</P>
<P>
   Identified as a man who knows the psyche of Bill Clinton inside
out, Maraniss was asked to conjecture about the air between the
president and first lady during their Martha's Vineyard vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Without hesitation, Maraniss stated solemnly that the Clintons
would be ``in different rooms reading different books.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, I hit bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Before me was nauseating proof of just how bad my addiction to
Clinton blah-blah-blah had gotten. I, a mature woman with a good
brain and a college degree _ a woman who is not going to live
forever _ was spending precious moments of my life listening to a
highly paid news anchor bestow omniscience on a newspaperman.
</P>
<P>
   And the newspaperman was accepting it.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Maraniss won a 1993 Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on
Clinton. His biography of the president, ``First In His Class,'' is
considered thorough and respectable. But because of the demand
produced by the nation's addiction to Clinton blah-blah-blah,
because of all the pushers who have gotten in on the game since
Monica Lewinsky was discovered, Maraniss has become more than a
good reporter.
</P>
<P>
   He is now the designated voice of Bill Clinton's inner self.
Further, he is counted upon to see across miles, through walls,
into the future and tell us what will occur between a husband and
wife during their private moments.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, how low could I go? Like many addicts, hitting bottom did
not immediately stop me from consuming more poison. Monday night, I
channel-surfed into the late hours, gulping, sniffing and shooting
the theories and opinions of others.
</P>
<P>
   Political pundits. Passengers at Dulles Airport. Former
assistant federal prosecutors. Former White House aides. Former
White House convicted felons. Paula Jones' former image consultant.
Even former Vice President Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning I awoke knowing that I never wanted to feel
that way again.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully, I listened to the news on National Public Radio, then
switched to a classical music station when an ``analysis'' of the
president's speech began. (I saw the speech. Why do I need someone
else to analyze it for me?)
</P>
<P>
   Despite a craving for ``just a few minutes'' of CNN or MSNBC, I
resisted. The last several months have taught me there is no such
thing as a little hit of Clinton blah-blah-blah.
</P>
<P>
   From now on, when there is actual news from or about the
president _ say, his wife actually dumps him _ I will consume and
digest it. Everything else I will view as bad, bad dope, and I will
try my level best to leave it alone.
</P>
<P>
   Life is too short for any other approach.

BETWEEN THE LINES, MAPS HAVE A STORY TO TELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN FLINN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before he penned the first word of ``Treasure Island,'' before
he laid out the initial plot line or dreamed up a single character,
Robert Louis Stevenson sat down and drew himself a map.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was elaborately and (I thought) beautifully coloured,'' he
wrote. ``It contained harbors that pleased me like sonnets ...
(and) as I pored over my map of Treasure Island, the future
characters in the book began to appear there visibly among
imaginary woods.''
</P>
<P>
   Any traveler who loves maps understands what a powerful hold
they have upon our imagination, how these exquisite blends of
science and art can contain mystery, intrigue and beauty within
their contour lines.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Theroux, to whom I'm indebted for the Stevenson quote, said
he kept a map of Central America next to his desk during the two
years he spent writing his novel, ``The Mosquito Coast.'' Whenever
he was stuck for an idea, he said, he could find one within the
folds of his map.
</P>
<P>
   For me _ and I suspect I'm joined by other cartophiles in this _
travel is partly a quest to confirm with my own eyes the worlds
maps have conjured up for me.
</P>
<P>
   For years I kept in my study a beautiful, German-made
Alpenvereinskarte 1:25,000-scale map of the Khumbu Himal, the
region around Mount Everest. I unfolded it and studied it so many
times _ tracing the routes of the early Everesters, trying to
deduce where Mallory and Irvine vanished above the North Col,
plotting fantasy journeys of my own _ that it eventually began to
tear along the folds.
</P>
<P>
   I had to buy a new one before I finally booked a real trip to
the Khumbu. And when, toward the end of that trip, I staggered,
gasping for breath, to the top of a 20,000-foot-high mountain, I
risked frostbite to take off my mittens so I could carefully unfold
my map and match its beautiful swirls and squiggles to the actual
peaks, glaciers, valleys and villages below me.
</P>
<P>
   Endlessly beguiling, maps have their own culture and traditions.
Did you know, for instance, that maps routinely contain phony
streets or tributaries so their makers can readily tell when
competitors copy their work? These bogus notations _ called
``bunnies'' _ are surprisingly common. Near Stockton and Lombard
streets on the Carto Graphics map of San Francisco, for instance,
there is a fictitious ``Geek Street'' _ a source of endless
confusion for Fed-Ex deliverymen.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes the notations are not so fictitious. In the 1930s,
a cartographer at Rand McNally unilaterally appended his own name
to a previously nameless mountain in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The unrelenting brouhaha about the Mercator Projection tells you
something about the power maps have over us. As you might recall
from junior high school, Flemish cartographer Geradus Mercator set
out in 1569 to solve what is clearly an unsolvable problem: how to
render a three-dimensional globe accurately on a two-dimensional
piece of paper. On his map, the lines of longitude, instead of
converging at the poles, run parallel to each other.
</P>
<P>
   This created a handy tool for navigation _ it's still used by
ships' captains _ but distorted the size of continents. Land masses
close to the equator are represented fairly accurately, those in
the middle latitudes _ such as North America and Europe _ are
expanded considerably and those close to the poles, such as Alaska
and Greenland, are grossly oversized. On a Mercator projection, for
instance, North America appears larger than Africa, when in reality
the reverse is true.
</P>
<P>
   This has caused a battle in the cartographic community that has
been going on for nearly a century. Some, who feel size does in
fact matter, call Mercator's map ``eurocentric'' and ``the
self-conceit of the white man.'' In 1973 German mapmaker Arno
Peters even came up with an ``egalitarian map'' that shows
continents in the correct size relative to each other. But his map
elongates and distorts the shape of the land masses until they're
all but unrecognizable. And besides, it's ugly and unaesthetic: one
critic likened it to ``wet, ragged, long winter underwear hung out
to dry on the Arctic Circle.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the very reason we're called Americans and not
something else is due almost entirely to some capriciousness on the
part of a mapmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Waldseemuller, a cartographer at a small college in
eastern France in the early 1500s, was working on an update of
Ptolemy's ancient world map and was looking for a name to give to
the recently discovered New World. He heard of a series of letters
circulating in Florence that claimed, with reckless disregard for
the truth, that the discoverer of the New World had been one
Amerigo Vespucci. In fact, Vespucci had merely been a passenger or
lowly officer on ships captained by others.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. In one of those what-the-hell gestures that reshape
world history, Waldseemuller penned Amerigo's name onto his map
(after Latinizing and feminizing it) and the rest is, as they say,
history.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bryson, who dug up this anecdote for his book ``Made in
America,'' follows with a fascinating bit of trivia: Amerigo
Vespucci may not have had much to do with discovering his namesake
continents, but he did have one possible, if marginal, claim to
fame _ he is believed to be the brother of Simonetta Vespucci, the
model for Venus in the Botticelli painting.
</P>
<P>
   We're certainly getting off the subject here, but that's what
happens when you unfold a map and let your imagination wander.

 &HT;    League of the South serious about secession
 &HT;    (Resending for those who need it. Photos are available from the
New York Times News Service)
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- Nathan Bedford Forrest doesn't get many
kudos these days. The brilliant Confederate general was also a
slave trader and grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, and his name has
become so sullied by its association with racism that vandals have
declared war on the monument at his grave in Memphis. So his
admirers took no chances last month when they unveiled a new
tribute to Forrest in Nashville _ a 25-foot-tall statue showing the
Rebel on horseback leading a charge, sword in one hand, pistol in
the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used a special finish,'' says sculptor Jack Kershaw. ``The
graffiti wipes right off.''
</P>
<P>
   On dedication day, the Overton High School auditorium filled
with 400 uniformed re-enactors and other Confederate sympathizers.
When the master of ceremonies asked them to stand for the national
anthem, a guitarist began to strum the tune that every American
knows by heart. Not ``The Star-Spangled Banner''; he played
</P>
<P>
   ``Dixie.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was time for the keynote speaker. Michael Hill would
never be mistaken for Bedford Forrest. At 46, Hill is a history
professor with a retreating hairline, a beard going gray and a soft
drawl with impeccable manners to match. He has never served in the
military or ridden with the Klan, yet he deeply identifies with the
fierce Confederate cavalryman and is attempting in his fashion to
``keep the skeer'' on the Yankees, as the unpolished Forrest once
put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no peace until we are a separate and free people
again,'' Hill told the faithful in a low, forceful tone, his tall
frame towering over the microphone. ``The day of apologizing for
the conduct of our Confederate ancestors is over.''
</P>
<P>
   When the yips and whoops died down, the meaning of his words
hung in the air like smoke after a musket shot. A separate people?
Surely he wasn't resurrecting the ``S'' word that started the
shooting six score and 17 years ago?
</P>
<P>
   He most certainly was. Hill is president of the League of the
South, an Alabama-based organization that claims almost 7,000
members and wants the former Confederate states to finish what they
started in 1861 by revisiting the option of secession. (Or, in the
words of a popular bumper sticker: ``If at first you don't secede,
try, try again.'') When Hill isn't defending the Lost Cause _ and
here comes one of those exquisite ironies that sprout through the
cracks of the South like pokeweed _ he's a professor at Stillman
College, a Presbyterian school in Tuscaloosa whose student body is
98 percent black.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a puzzle to many of us on the faculty,'' says his
colleague R.L. Guffin, a humanities professor.
</P>
<P>
   They take their stand
</P>
<P>
   Hill and a group of like-minded scholars conceived the League
four years ago. They were frustrated by Washington's expanding
power, angry over the federal siege at Waco, Texas, alarmed by the
accelerating attacks on Confederate symbols, concerned about the
homogenization of Southern culture. They were also inspired by the
breakup of the Soviet Union and the growth of separatist movements
from Quebec to Tibet; in fact, they took their name from one of
them, the Northern League of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The organization has spread beyond the former Confederacy to
chapters in 27 states. The membership _ lawyers, doctors, farmers
and everything else from preachers to professors _ stays in touch
via the league's Web site (www.dixienet.org). The computer screen
greets them with partisan songs such as ``The Bonnie Blue Flag''
and keeps them apprised of ``heritage violations'' such as the
proposal to remove the Confederate battle flag from the South
Carolina state Capitol. All communication is carried out with
British spelling (``honourable'') because the American standard was
set by a New Englander, Noah Webster. Many Leaguers also refuse to
recite the Pledge of Allegiance (they have problems with ``one
nation, indivisible'') or use a ZIP code (they call it the Yankee
Occupation Code).
</P>
<P>
   While much of this may sound like symbolic tomfoolery, there is
a serious philosophical dissent behind it. Like the Fugitive poets
who published ``I'll Take My Stand'' in 1930, the league holds that
the South has a distinctive agrarian tradition that ought to be
preserved. And like conservatives today, the league argues that the
central government has gobbled the powers of the states and one day
will find itself threatened by devolutionary movements in
disaffected regions such as the Mountain West and the South. ``We
will be an independent nation, and trust me, our capital will not
be Atlanta,'' says Lake High, chairman of the South Carolina
chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Others are drawn to the league for darker reasons. ``We get
calls from people who think we're some kind of racial thing or a
militia group,'' Hill says. ``I've had to kick out some former
Klansmen. Any movement is going to get bad apples.''
</P>
<P>
   One of them may have dropped into the league's annual conference
in Birmingham last month. Gordon Mellish, a new member from
Clemmons, N.C., explained that he had joined because he felt
victimized by affirmative action and stagnant property values in
the integrated neighborhood where he used to live. ``The niggers
ruined it,'' he said. ``They made a racist out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Poverty Law Center, an Alabama civil rights
organization that keeps track of hate groups, has called Hill a
``gussied-up theocrat,'' but does not consider the League a hate
group. ``They're not dangerous in the sense that they're going to
blow up buildings or beat up black people,'' says the Center's Mark
Potok. ``The danger is that they give a false veneer of legitimacy
to bigoted views.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a charge that Hill hears frequently. He addresses it again
as he lights a Backwoods cigar during an interview in a Tuscaloosa
coffee shop. He's had telephone death threats and doesn't like
having reporters visit his home, where he keeps the League's
office. Yes, he thinks the South should have been left alone to
handle slavery and segregation as it saw fit; yes, he opposes civil
rights laws on principle; no, he's not for slavery or Jim Crow
statutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe, under any circumstances, that the government
has the right to push people together or keep them apart,'' Hill
says. ``If blacks and whites in the South had been allowed to work
it out for themselves (during the civil rights movement), it might
have taken a little more time, but the outcome would have been
better. Instead, a lot of people were poking their noses into our
business, and they were probably just trying to cover up the mess
in their backyards.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Celts and Crackers
</P>
<P>
   If Hill sounds testy about Northern civil rights workers,
perhaps it has something to do with his family's first encounter
with outside agitators. Hill grew up in Winfield, a small town in
northwestern Alabama, where his father ran a building supplies
business and his mother worked as a church secretary. During the
Civil War, according to an old family story, his great grandmother
took up an ax and faced down a pack of Union soldiers who wanted to
steal her food. Michael loved war stories, loved to read history,
loved to run through the woods imagining himself as a Rebel, with a
stick for a rifle.
</P>
<P>
   After high school, Hill attended community college and then
enrolled down the road at the University of Alabama. He met a Selma
girl, got married and dropped out to drive a truck for his father.
At his wife's urging, he returned to school and eventually earned a
master's degree and doctorate in history. He was greatly influenced
by one of his teachers, Grady McWhiney, a well-known historian
whose book ``Cracker Culture'' attributes the character of white
Southerners to their origins as freedom-craving Celts in the
British Isles. Hill made Celtic studies his specialty; he's written
two books on Celtic warfare and counts ``Braveheart'' as one of his
favorite films.
</P>
<P>
   As he began his teaching career at Stillman, Hill gradually
became acquainted with a circle of conservative Southern thinkers _
journalists like Thomas Fleming, editor of the magazine Chronicles,
and academics like Clyde Wilson, a University of South Carolina
historian who is an authority on the proto-states' righter John C.
Calhoun. In June 1994, Hill summoned 40 of them to Tuscaloosa for a
three-day organizational meeting at the Best Western motel. It was
the year of the Angry White Male, and their sessions were no
exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were at each other's throats,'' Hill remembers.
</P>
<P>
   One topic of debate was what constitutes a Southerner: Could a
Yankee join the League? A black person? ``We had a discussion about
whether blacks could be Southerners, and we decided that of course
they could,'' says Gary Mills, a University of Alabama historian.
``But we knew that blacks would probably be leery of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill believes the League has some black members but isn't
certain. The one black academic invited to the first meeting didn't
come. A dozen or so others who did come immediately seceded from
the group, and the remainder founded the League.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for hostilities to commence.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Stillman, Hill was teaching part-time at the
University of Alabama. A student chapter formed there and quickly
raised hackles when its leader marched into a professor's office
and reprimanded her for teaching anti-South propaganda. ``He took
me to task for saying that slavery was a sin,'' says Diane Roberts,
an English professor and sixth-generation Southerner. She wrote
about the incident in a magazine article and criticized the League
in newspaper columns and commentaries for National Public Radio.
Hill has come to regard Roberts as such a thorn in the side that he
posted a letter on the Web site this summer condemning her
``hysterical crusade'' and calling her a ``Jacobin.'' (That's
history prof talk for a radical.)
</P>
<P>
   The notoriety cost Hill. After the League started getting
negative publicity, the university dropped him as an adjunct
professor. ``They said it was budget, but I'm sure it was because
of the League,'' he says. ``You can be a Marxist or a homosexual,
but you can't be pro-Confederate.''
</P>
<P>
   Juggling the black, white and gray
</P>
<P>
   Stillman College, on the other side of Tuscaloosa, was in a more
awkward position. Hill had been there since 1981 and was tenured.
Furthermore, he had served as faculty president and was considered
an exemplary classroom teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the finest young Christian family men I'd ever
met,'' says Stillman president emeritus Cordell Wynn, who hired
Hill. ``I used to joke at faculty meetings that Michael was all
right for a white guy. We were very close, and I was very much hurt
to see him identified with the League.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynn and Hill had heartfelt conversations about the matter. The
administrator had grown up in segregation and once had been turned
away from the University of Georgia because of his race. After the
school desgregated, he was admitted and earned his doctorate there.
``I told him, 'Michael, if your group had its way, I never would
have attended the university,''' Wynn says. ``And he said, 'Oh, no,
that's not what I'm advocating.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hill says he was approached by another Stillman administrator 2
1/2 years ago about the possibility of taking a leave or resigning.
Hill replied with a letter proposing severence terms. He has heard
nothing else about it.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn retired in 1997 and was succeeded by Ernest McNealey, a
native Alabamian who had spent years in the North and was
astonished, upon his return, to find that he had a flaming
secessionist in his employ. He says the Hill controversy has
embarrassed Stillman and, judging from conversations with parents,
has cost it some students. But he isn't looking to fire the
professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The views he articulates are somewhat pathetic and sad,''
McNealey says, ``but the right to speak your mind is part of
academic freedom. We have no complaints from students. As long as
he behaves himself on campus, we have no legal mechanism to limit
his activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill vows that he maintains a wall between the League and his
duties at Stillman. When students ask about the organization,
usually after class, he answers their questions. Otherwise, he
doesn't discuss it. Eyebrows may raise when he drives his red
Toyota pickup onto campus _ the one with the ``Free the South''
bumper sticker across the back _ but no one has made an issue of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Hill runs the League from a converted dining room in his ranch
house in suburban Tuscaloosa. Sara, his wife of 24 years, is his
secretary and bookkeeper. His 16-hour work days leave little time
for hobbies _ just tending a vegetable garden and reading history
and the Bible. The Hills are deeply religious and belong to the
conservative Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church. They decided
to home-school their youngest daughter, the only of three left in
the nest, after she came home complaining that her public school
teachers were running down the South. Her parents try to keep her
away from TV, too. ``I don't immerse myself in the modern world
anymore than I have to,'' Hill says.
</P>
<P>
   Should he want to withdraw himself further, the League is trying
to help. The members are raising money to pay him a salary in case
he ever elects to quit Stillman and devote himself full-time to the
cause. They call it the ``Free Michael'' fund.
</P>
<P>
   Two words: Confederate underwear
</P>
<P>
   When the Southern independence movement gathered for its annual
conference last month, the scene was rich with irony. The
latter-day Confederates met in a four-star hotel attached to a
shopping mall at the intersection of two federal interstate
highways in the suburbs of Birmingham, a city that didn't exist
when Lee surrendered at Appomattox.
</P>
<P>
   It was not your rough-and-tumble re-enactor crowd. There was
khaki and seersucker galore but very little butternut twill among
the 350 Leaguers who registered. While a few would have looked at
home in a Civil War tintype _ the men with their facial shrubbery,
the women with their hair in Victorian buns _ most of the group
could have passed for Rotarians. That is, until you walked from the
lobby into the ballroom, where Rebel flags draped the podium and a
portrait of Jefferson Davis fronted the lectern. On the far side of
the hall, a dozen vendors peddled everything from Confederate
underwear to Confederate pillow shams to Confederate literature
(''If you think Bill Clinton has a character problem,'' read one
book come-on, ``take a look at Abraham Lincoln'').
</P>
<P>
   For two days, members attended workshops and listened as a
succession of witty and sometimes hot-headed orators decried the
federal government, public schools and a host of other bugaboos. In
the president's address, Hill was coolly professorial as he quoted
Locke and Hobbes in railing against the ``Godless unitary state.''
But then he trained his fire on a target closer to home. ``Most
Southerners don't have the stomach for this,'' he said. ``They're
fat, lazy and happy.'' They'd rather worry, he continued, about
buying a new bass boat than establishing a true constitutional
government.
</P>
<P>
   The target may have hit closer to home than Hill thought. During
a break, as a few Leaguers and spouses headed off to the mall to
shop, one of the organization's board members told a story. ``One
time,'' said Thomas Fleming, ``I suggested that everyone burn their
$5 bills as a protest against Lincoln. No one took me up on it. I
guess sacrificing five Yankee dollars was too much to ask.''

 &HT;    Secession: do they mean it?
 &HT;    (Resending for those who need it. Photos are available from the
New York Times News Service)
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The League of the South describes itself as
``paleo-conservative,'' with a states' rights fundamentalism that
makes members almost as contemptuous of Newt Gingrich as Bill
Clinton. If it were up to the states of the former Confederacy,
says league president Michael Hill, there would be no abortion, no
income tax, no gun control, no gay rights, no affirmative action
and no restrictions on prayer in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   As controversial as those stands are, the league position that
has attracted the most attention is the call for secession. Are
these people serious?
</P>
<P>
   Yes ... but no one's unstacking arms.
</P>
<P>
   Different members interpret secession differently. Some take it
literally, foreseeing a Southern nation. Others see it as a tool to
pressure Washington into restoring power to the states in keeping
with the original sense of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Central authority is devolving around the world,'' says Donald
Livingston, an Emory University philosophy professor who heads the
league's educational committee. ``Why should the United States, the
last 19th-century empire, be an exception?''
</P>
<P>
   The league does not advocate rebellion or civil disobedience,
Hill says. ``We're not so foolish as to believe we can run out on
the street and yell, `Secession!' and have people fall in line.
What we're really about now is to articulate a good defense of
secession. To educate people and recruit candidates to run for
local office. We think the South would be better off as an
independent nation, but we realize it's not likely to happen
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Not judging from the poll numbers, anyway. For the past six
years, the University of North Carolina's Institute for Research in
Social Science has surveyed Southerners on whether they think their
region should be a separate nation. Secessionist sentiment has
ranged from 5 percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   John Shelton Reed, the institute's director, points out that the
league wasn't organized until the rise of attacks on Confederate
heroes and the Confederate battle flag _ symbols that had gone more
or less unchallenged for a century. ``I think this is as much about
defending a version of history,'' he says, ``as about attaining
Southern independence.''

THE CLINTON COLLECTION: EVERYONE WANTS THAT NECKTIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ That presidential cravat, tied up in the
controversy over Bill Clinton's White House escapades, is a fashion
rage.
</P>
<P>
   At the Bullock &AMP; Jones store in San Francisco's tony Union
Square, a couple looking for neckties chuckled when they discovered
one that looked remarkably similar to the gold and navy tie Monica
Lewinsky supposedly gave the president for his 50th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lady said to me, `He can't get this one because it
represents the `signal tie' _ you know, the one that Clinton wore
when he wanted to get in touch with Monica,''' tie salesman Herman
Storey said.
</P>
<P>
   The tie the woman held was by the same designer _ Ermenegildo
Zegna _ as the president's, but it was not an exact match.
</P>
<P>
   Zegna officials in the Italian designer's New York City offices
reluctantly admitted they had been besieged with calls, but
declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Several high-end retailers were swamped Wednesday with calls
about the tie after it was pictured and featured Wednesday in a
story on the front page of The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   According to the newspaper, Clinton was questioned about the tie
during his grand jury testimony Monday on his relationship with
Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The president wore the tie in question on Aug. 6, prompting
insinuations from prosecutors that it was used to send some sort of
a secret signal to Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 6 was the same day Lewinsky appeared before a federal
grand, contradicting her earlier testimony in saying she did have
an affair with the president in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have called asking for the tie. We obviously don't have
it because it's two years old,'' said a slightly weary but amused
spokeswoman for Saks Fifth Avenue in New York. ``I don't know why
they want it. Maybe it's just to say, `Hey, I've got the same
tie.'''
</P>
<P>
   The silk tie, a 1996 design with a navy crisscross pattern over
a gold background, retailed for about $110. Lewinsky, now 25,
reportedly gave it to Clinton, who turned 52 on Wednesday, with the
message: ``When I see you wearing this tie, I'll know that I am
close to your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Neiman Marcus spokeswoman Alexandra Elliott said Wednesday she
was so busy answering questions about the tie it was difficult to
handle other inquiries. ``It's a strange phenomenon to me,'' she
said from the retail store's Dallas headquarters. ``People just
want to know about that tie.''
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, Nordstrom shopper Chuck Brauer said he
wouldn't be surprised if knockoffs of the tie started to appear
soon. ``It's the American way to pick up on something like this and
turn it into a marketing opportunity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bill Clinton affair tie _ I don't think I'd want to be
associated with that,'' said another Nordstrom shopper, Brian
Bishop, as he looked for ties. ``It seems pretty absurd.''

TEXAS DROUGHT WORST SINCE '50S; MAY WIPE OUT UP TO 25 PERCENT OF
FARMERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WORTH WREN JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The drought of '98 has cost state farms and
ranches $2.1 billion, making it the worst weather disaster for
Texas agriculture since the infamous drought of the 1950s,
agricultural economists say.
</P>
<P>
   The new crop loss estimate tops the $2.09 billion lost in the
1996 drought.
</P>
<P>
   And Roland Smith, an economist for the Texas Agricultural
Extension Service, said the broad economic ripple effect will
approach $5.8 billion in losses from 1998 into 2000, up from nearly
$4.95 billion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to lose some producers, and we're already down to
our frugal and best managers,'' Texas Agriculture Commissioner Rick
Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   Wes Sims, president of the Waco-based Texas Farmers Union and a
Sweetwater-area farmer and rancher, estimated that the state could
lose up to 25 percent of its farmers and ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   Sims said, ``Prices are also a disaster.'' The drought is not as
widespread as in '96, which means that supplies have not been
reduced as sharply. Prices, in turn, have remained low.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hardest-hit crops are cotton, corn and sorghum.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Anderson, an extension economist and cotton specialist,
called this year's cotton crop one of the worst in Texas history.
</P>
<P>
   The new estimate of cotton losses rose to $704 million, from
last month's estimate of about $500 million, based on last week's
first official government crop forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton, the state's leading cash crop, typically generates $1.3
billion to $1.6 billion annually in gross farm cash receipts.
</P>
<P>
   This year's projected harvest of 3.1 million 480-pound bales
represents an estimated 40 percent plunge from last year's
production. It's 29 percent less than the drought-slashed 1996
crop, and the smallest Texas cotton crop since 2.87 million bales
were harvested in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2 million planted acres won't be harvested, and the
drought damage is expected to run higher before the harvest is
completed this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1950, there have been only 10 other years when Texas
farmers raised smaller cotton crops.
</P>
<P>
   The '50s drought lasted five to seven years and remains the
worst natural disaster to hit Texas agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson said the financial risks in farming and ranching
are far greater today.
</P>
<P>
   That raises the question, he said, of whether the 1996 and 1998
disasters will rival the '50s impact on its mass population shift
from rural to urban centers.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the spotty rains have come too late to soften the
already-incurred losses but are greening up ranch pastures and may
curb further losses on some irrigated corn and cotton in Northwest
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 loss estimates, he said, understate the disaster's
severity when compared with 1996. That's because average cotton
prices are down by about 25 percent, and corn and sorghum prices
are down about 35 percent since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Losses have also continued to rise on other crops, including
irrigated corn and sorghum, and lenders are warning that 1999
carryover debt will be common and often run into heavy sums for
farmers and ranchers statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson Upton, a cotton, peanut and grain farmer in the
Seminole-Denver City area of Northwest Texas, said that even his
irrigated crops won't stop the drought from pumping red ink onto
his balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Upton's and thousands of other farmers' irrigation wells haven't
been able to keep pace with the water needs of their heat-tortured
crops.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Upton thinks he will have enough land equity for
collateral to obtain refinancing on his 1998 losses and his credit
needs for next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's so sad about the whole situation is, most of the young
farmers, they don't have any land,'' said Upton, who at age 37 is
still considered young in an aging farming population.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Stallman, president of the Waco-based Texas Farm Bureau and
a coastal rice and cattle farmer, said the drought will put an
uncertain number of farmers out of business and shrink the numbers
of cotton gins, fertilizer suppliers, seed dealers and other
agricultural and rural businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our loss will be determined by what Congress does in
September,'' Sims said. When Congress reconvenes, it will consider
two bills offering financial aid, not loans, and higher crop
price-support loans to boost market prices.
</P>
<P>
   The direct payments could total $500 million or more, and Sims
said the sum could run to $2 billion, with Texas getting the
largest share.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest rural disaster, Perry warned, could come in the
state's Lower Rio Grande Valley, where many farmers have been
forced to carry over debt for five to six years with weather- and
pest-induced losses.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said he's urging commercial lenders, federal banking
regulators, the U.S. Agriculture Department and Congress to pool
their efforts to be more lenient on loans.

 &HT;    JAMAICAN GOVERNMENT LOOKS TO WHIZ KID IN DREADLOCKS TO GET
TOE-HOLD IN CYBERSPACE

<TEXT>
<P>
   KINGSTON, Jamaica _ He swoons over the Spice Girls. He mouths
off to his mother. He signs his name by drawing a smiley face --
flanked by dreadlocks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this seemingly typical 13-year-old boy -- Makonnen David
Blake Hannah -- holds a lot of sway on this sunny Caribbean island
of 2.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
   As the government's new technology consultant, the fidgety
teenager has the ears of Jamaica's most-influential politicos, with
a direct line to the Ministry of Commerce and Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to keep me abreast of new technology,'' said
Phillip Paulwell, Jamaica's Minister of Commerce and Technology.
``It is the young people who know about computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulwell, 36, began using computers three years ago. Hannah's
been honing his skills for 10.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister P.J. Patterson appointed Paulwell only last
January to head what was a newly created ministry on a
tourist-dependent island that's still, for the most part, a
technological wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   Globally, some 60 percent of all new jobs will require
technology-based skills by century's end, which doesn't bode well
for Jamaica, where only 35,000 to 40,000 people have logged on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Hannah, who relishes karate and fast Japanese cars, the
focus of his ever-changing site on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   He's been charged with advising the government on computer
hardware and software and visiting schools to talk to young people
about the advantages of using computers.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it makes him Jamaica's youngest-ever government
advisor, the one-year appointment doesn't seem to faze the worldly
youngster, who's visited several U.S. cities. His favorite? New
York and Orlando, by far. The best part may be the honorarium that
comes with it: a few dollars a week he'll use to go watch movies.
</P>
<P>
   The cocky, self-assured adolescent who collects National
Geographic magazines and reads science textbooks for fun taught
himself how to program computers and clean up viruses. He's also an
accomplished Web page designer. Yet he speaks of these skills with
the nonchalance of someone who's just mastered inline skates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can program a little bit, and I'm good at system design,
advanced Windows, DOS usage, stuff like that,'' said Hannah, with
saucer-like eyes and an easy laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah was raised in the nice, solidly middle-class neighborhood
of Mona Heights, where streets have sidewalks, and neighbors might
include journalists and low-level politicians.
</P>
<P>
   An intermittent child actor, Hannah appeared on Nickelodeon a
few years ago in a segment that featured children from around the
world. For his part, Hannah showed viewers how much mildew had
accumulated on a coconut he'd left under his bed for a week.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah parlayed a handful of acting gigs into an invitation to
attend the Chicago Children's Film Festival in 1995, which is where
he met Paulwell, who came away duly impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just extremely intelligent and full of energy,'' Paulwell
said. ``He knows more about computers than perhaps anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike another homegrown celebrity, Jody-Anne Maxwell, 12, who
won the National Spelling Bee last May, Hannah is not a product of
Jamaica's public school system.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah's mother, novelist Barbara Blake, pulled her son out of
school at age five after a teacher scolded him with a smack on the
hand for questioning whether Jesus was really white.
</P>
<P>
   He's been home-schooled ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've taught him what's relevant, and computers are all we have
to save us from a very poor education system,'' said Blake, who was
introduced to computers by an American friend. ``We live in a
global community and the computer is the best way for children to
be able to connect to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake is a doting mother with strong opinions. She credits her
son's intelligence to six years of breastfeeding.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his mother, Hannah comes from a long line of
eccentric -- yet cerebral -- ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   His grandfather, Evon Blake, was a famous journalist who decades
ago launched a Newsweek-like magazine in the Caribbean called
Spotlight. He had a penchant for pipes and white, shark-skin suits,
and is credited with breaking the color barrier here in the 1940s
by jumping into a whites-only swimming pool at a posh hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always had Life and Ebony magazines around the house, and
my father used a pen as his weapon,'' Barbara Blake said. ``My
father always encouraged me to think, which is what I've always
tried to pass on to my child.''
</P>
<P>
   And she has.
</P>
<P>
   Her son's as preoccupied with computers as other teenage boys
might be with girls.
</P>
<P>
   But he hardly looks the part of government advisor.
</P>
<P>
   A talented soccer player, he wears an Adidas jogging suit and
dreadlocks that stretch the length of his arms -- his matted
tendrils have never been cut.
</P>
<P>
   The rope-like locks draw double-takes, but are actually a tenet
of his family's faith in the Rastafarian religion.
</P>
<P>
   Loosely based on Christianity, Rastafarianism stresses the
back-to-Africa teachings of Jamaican pan-Africanist Marcus Garvey
while advocating black unity. To believers, Ethiopia is like Eden.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous Rastafarian was reggae music star Bob Marley,
with whom Hannah shares a birthday on Feb. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his unconventional appearance, Hannah says he mixes
easily with government types.
</P>
<P>
   He e-mails Paulwell almost every day and meets with him once a
week face-to-face.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to know what is on the Internet,'' Hannah said.
``He's real cool so he's easy to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent editorial in the daily newspaper here showed Paulwell
and Hannah in front of a computer playing Pac Man and sucking on
lollipops.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Paulwell, Hannah's job is nothing to snicker
at.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has yet to gain a toe-hold in Jamaica, some 550 miles
south of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The island's future, Paulwell contends, rides on the knowledge
of the young. And that knowledge must be more technology-based.
</P>
<P>
   The precocious prodigy has his work cut out for him.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica, like other less-developed islands, has been locked for
years out of the technology market because of high costs. A
computer with a 200 megahertz Intel Pentium processor that sells
for $520 in the United States would cost at least $1,200 in
Jamaica. With a per-capita income of about $1,500 a year, most
people here can't afford a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica's in the midst of an economic recession that's left one
in three people living in poverty and nearly half of all young men
aged 16 to 25 unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   The government's goal to put a computer in all of Jamaica's 997
public schools by the year 2000 is deceptively simple: many have
yet to install a phone line.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our teachers have never even used computers before,''
said Jean Beaumont, who provides computer training to teachers.
``Some find them complicated, and others are just very afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, government officials warned that
date-recognition software -- a problem known as the ``millennium
bug'' -- won't be corrected before Jan. 1, 2000, and probably not
until the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
   But while his country struggles to gain some ground
technologically, working for Microsoft Inc. someday is what's
mostly on the mind of Hannah, who seems hungry for the trappings of
American mogulism.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream would be to meet Bill Gates,'' Hannah said, turning
suddenly serious. ``The man has revolutionized the world.''

   ARRAZOLA, Mexico _ He's the father of slithering serpents, giant
crabs, a ram with curled horns and sensual, almost human muscles.
</P>
<P>
   All his animals, says Claudio Ojeda, spring from the corners of
his mind and the chunks of wood his hands whittle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's spontaneous,'' the Mexican wood carver and Zapotec Indian
insists.
</P>
<P>
   But Ojeda also admits he finds inspiration in the hallucinogenic
mushrooms some Indians in this southern Mexican state consume for
spiritual and curative purposes.
</P>
<P>
   A beefy, friendly man who is proud of his craft and his
heritage, Ojeda is one of this village's most prosperous and
talented wood carvers.
</P>
<P>
   The village is Arrazola, and the state is Oaxaca (Wah-HA-ka),
where Zapotec and other Mexican Indians still reign when it comes
to culture.
</P>
<P>
   Seven miles southwest of the colonial city of Oaxaca, Arrazola
is home to a beloved Mexican craft: the production of
``animalitos,'' figures carved from the local copal tree and
painted in riotous colors.
</P>
<P>
   Carving is a centuries' old tradition, but in recent years the
artisans of Arrazola have elevated the art to a globally-desired
commodity. Their figures are sought by buyers from Europe, Asia and
all over the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Most are small enough to fit on a shelf, but wild enough to
attract instant attention. Horses sprout wings, as if ready to take
flight. Dogs with florid coats throw back their heads and howl.
Rabbits play congas or blow trumpets.
</P>
<P>
   The animals carved by Ojeda and painted by his wife, Teresa, are
noted for their large size -- some are two feet tall or wide -- and
exquisite detail.
</P>
<P>
   When he began carving in earnest 10 years ago, Ojeda
experimented by fashioning one large animal instead of many small
ones. The piece sold quickly and fetched a high price. Now Ojeda
can show off a thick wad of business cards from international
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father carved, too,'' Ojeda said. ``But he couldn't even
eat from what he sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Ojeda has sold pieces to Disney World in Orlando, galleries in
Chicago and the San Francisco Bay Area, and diplomatic offices in
Texas. He's been asked to exhibit in Hong Kong and his pieces
decorate homes from New York to Paris to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still raise some corn and beans. But we pretty much
dedicate ourselves to artisan work now,'' said Teresa Ojeda. As she
spoke, she was painstakingly decorating a large tortoise with three
frogs poised on its shell.
</P>
<P>
   As you approach Arrazola, you pass carts driven by oxen and
farmers carrying machetes. You begin to see signs in English and
Spanish inviting you into homes where the animals figures are
carved and sold.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a cluster of boys greets you at the edge of town,
offering to accompany you to a favorite carver's house for a few
pesos.
</P>
<P>
   Arrazola's prosperity is striking. The roads are paved, the
houses sturdy, satellite dishes are perched on roofs to pick up
television stations.
</P>
<P>
   Claudio Ojeda drives a pick-up and his home is equipped with a
shower and modern bathroom, startling amenities in an Indian
community.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ojedas' workshop remains a traditional family affair. In
a studio behind sliding glass doors, the couple invite customers in
to browse.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike smaller animals, which run under $10, the Ojedas' animals
don't come cheap. Most are the equivalent of $40 and up, sometimes
pushing into the hundreds. But that's a fraction of a U.S. gallery
price, and, by visiting, you get to see the full range of the
couple's creativity.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the studio, a dragon sports a tail that has metamorphosed
into a snake. A crab with bulging eyes seems to scuttle across the
floor, unaware of the reptile perched on its back. Hippopotamuses,
lobsters, and all sorts of other creatures find their way out of
the wood.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Ojeda is from a village where the pre-Hispanic tradition
of hallucinogenic mushrooms is still revered. She and her husband
both say mushrooms have given them visions of animals and colors
leaping and fusing. Neither takes this tradition lightly, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a strong mind,'' Claudio said. ``But it's
something mystical. Scientists can't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO VISIT: In Oaxaca city, hire a taxi, take a city bus or a
tour many hotels offer to Arrazola, where you can browse at the
Ojedas' on Emiliano Zapata Street, or, for smaller animals, at
other families' workshops.

<P>
   SAN BARTOLO COYOTEPEC, Mexico _ A special place in the hills
here has been yielding light gray clay for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   And the people of San Bartolo Coyotepec, a village in Mexico's
Oaxaca (Wah-HA-ka) state, still harvest it and shape it into bowls
and figurines -- much the same as their ancestors did.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1953, the Zapotec Indians here have given their
pottery a different spin. That's when a tiny, wizened local potter
named Dona Rosa discovered that she could give the subdued black
color of her oven-baked pots a lustrous shine -- simply by rubbing
unfinished pieces with a quartz stone before their final firing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People loved it. And today, thanks to Dona Rosa, people can
live from their art,'' says the now famous potter's son, Valente
Nieto Real, 70, whose family is among the top producers of Mexico's
popular ``black pottery.''
</P>
<P>
   The home of black pottery is San Bartolo Coyotepec, and it is
seven miles south of the colonial city of Oaxaca.
</P>
<P>
   The village is a well-known tourist destination, but it has
managed to retain its small-town character. The families who make
black pottery welcome visitors into their shops to browse and buy;
at Dona Rosa's workshop, her family also offers demonstrations
showing how they make their pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Small pieces of black pottery are often sold in Mexican art
galleries in the United States. But a visit to San Bartolo
Coyotepec, which is an easy drive down Oaxaca's Highway 175, offers
tourists from all over the world a chance to see and purchase
pieces hard to find abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents showed us where the clay is, and their parents
showed them,'' said Nieto Real, as he eagerly demonstrated how he
shapes clay into large round pots, pitchers, candlesticks and other
shapes.
</P>
<P>
   The classic pieces of black pottery are orbs with fluted edges,
and they range from a few inches to nearly two feet tall. Many of
them are decorated with flowers or perforated with exquisite lacy
designs, so that you can place a candle in them that reflects beads
of light.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the pots, which range in price from less than a dollar
up to $40, are scored with elaborate designs that resemble South
Pacific tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   Dona Rosa's family ships pots to Mexico City for a modest price.
Shipping to the United States is very expensive, so if you really
want a pot be sure to leave room in your luggage for safe packing.
</P>
<P>
   The clay the villagers harvest -- and protect with municipal
taxes -- is placed in a tub of water and strained through a sieve
to rid it of debris, explained Nieto Real.
</P>
<P>
   He picked up a slab of clay and slapped it on a pre-Hispanic
potter's wheel: a clay plate that spins with another plate turned
upside down on top of it.
</P>
<P>
   Even the tools the potter's use are mostly pre-Hispanic, Nieto
Real said, grasping the clay, expertly turning it into a hollow
cylinder and inflating it by hand into an orb. Other than skilled
hands, the potters' tools include wooden sticks and clay discs
shaped like moons.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces must be dried for several days before they can be
decorated or before handles can be attached. The laborious process
includes rubbing the pots with quartz that comes from the same
hills as the clay, to give them their characteristic black shine.
</P>
<P>
   Shiny black pots are porous and cannot hold water, Nieto Real
said, so buyers should beware. But the traditional gray-black pots,
which some people still make here, had been used for centuries for
water or as vessels for mescal, the local hard liquor.
</P>
<P>
   Nieto Real is proud that figures of gods and goddesses made from
the same clay he uses have been unearthed from Monte Alban, the
majestic Zapotec Indian ruins near his village.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our culture,'' Nieto Real said, pointing at the clay.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO GET THERE: Hire a taxi in downtown Oaxaca, take a city
bus or sign up for a tour at your hotel to go San Bartolo
Coyotepec, where signs point the way to Dona Rosa's shop on Benito
Juarez Street.

 &HT;    RUGS WOVEN FROM NATURE AND TRADITION MAKE OAXACAN VILLAGE A
FAVORITE TRIP
 &HT;    With MEXICO-ANIMALS-$ADV22, MEXICO-POTTERY-$ADV22; photos placed
in the International and Travel folders on the Cox Server.
 &HT;    EDs: Teotitlan del Valle is one of three villages profiled in a

<P>
   TEOTITLAN DEL VALLE, Mexico _ Margarita Sosa Vasquez plucked a
tiny lime off a tree in her patio, sliced it and squeezed its juice
into a cauldron of boiling orange water.
</P>
<P>
   It was a simple, sudden gesture. But it was part of a very
deliberate process that unfolds here every day: the preparation of
colored wool and the weaving of Zapotec Indian rugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lime helps keep the colors firm,'' said Sosa Vasquez, who,
like so many families in this Mexican village, opens up her home to
strangers who want to buy her rugs and observe them being made.
</P>
<P>
   Teotitlan del Valle, a Zapotec town surrounded by green hills
and fields of spike-tipped maguey plants, is 16 miles east of
Oaxaca (Wah-HA-ka) city, the capital of the state of the same name.
It's a well-known tourist destination and a magnet for folk art
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The rugs produced here, using techniques passed down for
generations, are similar to geometric-patterned Navajo rugs and
considered some of the finest in Mexican crafts. The town has
prospered with this trade, and some of the weavers have built
spacious homes and workshops that greet you as you roll into the
village.
</P>
<P>
   Books celebrate the weavers' skill, and many townsfolk have
printed business cards in English and Spanish to serve clientele
who return repeatedly or send friends to the village to browse
through racks and racks of rugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men used to weave before, but now everybody does it,'' said
Sosa Vasquez, who heads a large family of siblings and their
children, all who know how to dye the wool with natural substances
and operate the family's creaky old wooden looms.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked off an unpaved side street, the Sosa Vasquez home is
typical: chickens and children scamper in the patio and dogs snooze
lazily next to the looms and pots of scalding water where wool is
dyed. Inside the one-room home the family unfolds rugs of all sizes
and colors, offering prices that range from $25 to more than $200.
</P>
<P>
   Bargaining is expected.
</P>
<P>
   The patterns and colors are lovely, and so are stories behind
how each are made. To dye wool various shades of purple, pink and
red, the weavers scrape a pest off nopal cactus leaves called the
cochineal. The tiny pest, when crushed, creates a scarlet paste
that is added to boiling water.
</P>
<P>
   Blues and turquoises are derived from indigo leaves, greens from
alfalfa, orange from a local tree, and a rich brown comes from
crushed walnut shells.
</P>
<P>
   The wool is dyed, spun and then laboriously woven into mostly
geometric patterns on looms that are operated by foot pedals. Rugs
can take weeks or even months to complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years old, and he's already weaving squares,'' Sosa
Vasquez said, helping her nephew, Luis Roberto Rivera Sosa, climb
onto a diminutive loom designed for children.
</P>
<P>
   The rugs' patterns traditionally include jagged stripes
symbolizing lightening bolts, diamonds and designs from ancient
Indian ruins here. The weavers also make rugs with flowers and fish
on them, and some have experimented with copies of Miro or Picasso
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers recommend you check a rug carefully to see that it is
tightly woven and doesn't shine too much. A sheen can be a sign
that synthetic fibers have been used instead of natural wool. In
addition to visiting family workshops, you can also browse and
bargain in a market in the town square.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very beautiful work, and very complicated and
time-consuming,'' said Sosa Vasquez, who clearly takes joy in her
art and her Zapotec tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``These rugs can last 100 years,'' she says with satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO GET THERE: Hire a taxi, take a city bus or sign up for a
tour at your hotel in Oaxaca to take the 30-minute trip along
Highway 190 to Teotitlan del Valle. The Vasquez Sosa home is on a
cul-de-sac, Privada de Zaragoza.

cylinder and inflating it by hand into an orb. Other than skilled
hands, the potters' tools include wooden sticks and clay discs
shaped like moons.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces must be dried for several days before they can be
decorated or before handles can be attached. The laborious process
includes rubbing the pots with quartz that comes from the same
hills as the clay, to give them their characteristic black shine.
</P>
<P>
   Shiny black pots are porous and cannot hold water, Nieto Real
said, so buyers should beware. But the traditional gray-black pots,
which some people still make here, had been used for centuries for
water or as vessels for mescal, the local hard liquor.
</P>
<P>
   Nieto Real is proud that figures of gods and goddesses made from
the same clay he uses have been unearthed from Monte Alban, the
majestic Zapotec Indian ruins near his village.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our culture,'' Nieto Real said, pointing at the clay.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO GET THERE: Hire a taxi in downtown Oaxaca, take a city
bus or sign up for a tour at your hotel to go San Bartolo
Coyotepec, where signs point the way to Dona Rosa's shop on Benito
Juarez Street.

   ARRAZOLA, Mexico _ He's the father of slithering serpents, giant
crabs, a ram with curled horns and sensual, almost human muscles.
</P>
<P>
   All his animals, says Claudio Ojeda, spring from the corners of
his mind and the chunks of wood his hands whittle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's spontaneous,'' the Mexican wood carver and Zapotec Indian
insists.
</P>
<P>
   But Ojeda also admits he finds inspiration in the hallucinogenic
mushrooms some Indians in this southern Mexican state consume for
spiritual and curative purposes.
</P>
<P>
   A beefy, friendly man who is proud of his craft and his
heritage, Ojeda is one of this village's most prosperous and
talented wood carvers.
</P>
<P>
   The village is Arrazola, and the state is Oaxaca (Wah-HA-ka),
where Zapotec and other Mexican Indians still reign when it comes
to culture.
</P>
<P>
   Seven miles southwest of the colonial city of Oaxaca, Arrazola
is home to a beloved Mexican craft: the production of
``animalitos,'' figures carved from the local copal tree and
painted in riotous colors.
</P>
<P>
   Carving is a centuries' old tradition, but in recent years the
artisans of Arrazola have elevated the art to a globally-desired
commodity. Their figures are sought by buyers from Europe, Asia and
all over the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Most are small enough to fit on a shelf, but wild enough to
attract instant attention. Horses sprout wings, as if ready to take
flight. Dogs with florid coats throw back their heads and howl.
Rabbits play congas or blow trumpets.
</P>
<P>
   The animals carved by Ojeda and painted by his wife, Teresa, are
noted for their large size -- some are two feet tall or wide -- and
exquisite detail.
</P>
<P>
   When he began carving in earnest 10 years ago, Ojeda
experimented by fashioning one large animal instead of many small
ones. The piece sold quickly and fetched a high price. Now Ojeda
can show off a thick wad of business cards from international
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father carved, too,'' Ojeda said. ``But he couldn't even
eat from what he sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Ojeda has sold pieces to Disney World in Orlando, galleries in
Chicago and the San Francisco Bay Area, and diplomatic offices in
Texas. He's been asked to exhibit in Hong Kong and his pieces
decorate homes from New York to Paris to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still raise some corn and beans. But we pretty much
dedicate ourselves to artisan work now,'' said Teresa Ojeda. As she
spoke, she was painstakingly decorating a large tortoise with three
frogs poised on its shell.
</P>
<P>
   As you approach Arrazola, you pass carts driven by oxen and
farmers carrying machetes. You begin to see signs in English and
Spanish inviting you into homes where the animals figures are
carved and sold.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a cluster of boys greets you at the edge of town,
offering to accompany you to a favorite carver's house for a few
pesos.
</P>
<P>
   Arrazola's prosperity is striking. The roads are paved, the
houses sturdy, satellite dishes are perched on roofs to pick up
television stations.
</P>
<P>
   Claudio Ojeda drives a pick-up and his home is equipped with a
shower and modern bathroom, startling amenities in an Indian
community.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ojedas' workshop remains a traditional family affair. In
a studio behind sliding glass doors, the couple invite customers in
to browse.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike smaller animals, which run under $10, the Ojedas' animals
don't come cheap. Most are the equivalent of $40 and up, sometimes
pushing into the hundreds. But that's a fraction of a U.S. gallery
price, and, by visiting, you get to see the full range of the
couple's creativity.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the studio, a dragon sports a tail that has metamorphosed
into a snake. A crab with bulging eyes seems to scuttle across the
floor, unaware of the reptile perched on its back. Hippopotamuses,
lobsters, and all sorts of other creatures find their way out of
the wood.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Ojeda is from a village where the pre-Hispanic tradition
of hallucinogenic mushrooms is still revered. She and her husband
both say mushrooms have given them visions of animals and colors
leaping and fusing. Neither takes this tradition lightly, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a strong mind,'' Claudio said. ``But it's
something mystical. Scientists can't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO VISIT: In Oaxaca city, hire a taxi, take a city bus or a
tour many hotels offer to Arrazola, where you can browse at the
Ojedas' on Emiliano Zapata Street, or, for smaller animals, at
other families' workshops.

 &HT;    RUGS WOVEN FROM NATURE AND TRADITION MAKE OAXACAN VILLAGE A
FAVORITE TRIP
 &HT;    With MEXICO-ANIMALS-$ADV22, MEXICO-POTTERY-$ADV22; photos placed
in the International and Travel folders on the Cox Server.
 &HT;    EDs: Teotitlan del Valle is one of three villages profiled in a
three-part look at the artisan tradition that thrives in Mexico's
Oaxaca state.
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (t) Travel categories

<P>
   TEOTITLAN DEL VALLE, Mexico _ Margarita Sosa Vasquez plucked a
tiny lime off a tree in her patio, sliced it and squeezed its juice
into a cauldron of boiling orange water.
</P>
<P>
   It was a simple, sudden gesture. But it was part of a very
deliberate process that unfolds here every day: the preparation of
colored wool and the weaving of Zapotec Indian rugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lime helps keep the colors firm,'' said Sosa Vasquez, who,
like so many families in this Mexican village, opens up her home to
strangers who want to buy her rugs and observe them being made.
</P>
<P>
   Teotitlan del Valle, a Zapotec town surrounded by green hills
and fields of spike-tipped maguey plants, is 16 miles east of
Oaxaca (Wah-HA-ka) city, the capital of the state of the same name.
It's a well-known tourist destination and a magnet for folk art
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The rugs produced here, using techniques passed down for
generations, are similar to geometric-patterned Navajo rugs and
considered some of the finest in Mexican crafts. The town has
prospered with this trade, and some of the weavers have built
spacious homes and workshops that greet you as you roll into the
village.
</P>
<P>
   Books celebrate the weavers' skill, and many townsfolk have
printed business cards in English and Spanish to serve clientele
who return repeatedly or send friends to the village to browse
through racks and racks of rugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men used to weave before, but now everybody does it,'' said
Sosa Vasquez, who heads a large family of siblings and their
children, all who know how to dye the wool with natural substances
and operate the family's creaky old wooden looms.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked off an unpaved side street, the Sosa Vasquez home is
typical: chickens and children scamper in the patio and dogs snooze
lazily next to the looms and pots of scalding water where wool is
dyed. Inside the one-room home the family unfolds rugs of all sizes
and colors, offering prices that range from $25 to more than $200.
</P>
<P>
   Bargaining is expected.
</P>
<P>
   The patterns and colors are lovely, and so are stories behind
how each are made. To dye wool various shades of purple, pink and
red, the weavers scrape a pest off nopal cactus leaves called the
cochineal. The tiny pest, when crushed, creates a scarlet paste
that is added to boiling water.
</P>
<P>
   Blues and turquoises are derived from indigo leaves, greens from
alfalfa, orange from a local tree, and a rich brown comes from
crushed walnut shells.
</P>
<P>
   The wool is dyed, spun and then laboriously woven into mostly
geometric patterns on looms that are operated by foot pedals. Rugs
can take weeks or even months to complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years old, and he's already weaving squares,'' Sosa
Vasquez said, helping her nephew, Luis Roberto Rivera Sosa, climb
onto a diminutive loom designed for children.
</P>
<P>
   The rugs' patterns traditionally include jagged stripes
symbolizing lightening bolts, diamonds and designs from ancient
Indian ruins here. The weavers also make rugs with flowers and fish
on them, and some have experimented with copies of Miro or Picasso
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers recommend you check a rug carefully to see that it is
tightly woven and doesn't shine too much. A sheen can be a sign
that synthetic fibers have been used instead of natural wool. In
addition to visiting family workshops, you can also browse and
bargain in a market in the town square.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very beautiful work, and very complicated and
time-consuming,'' said Sosa Vasquez, who clearly takes joy in her
art and her Zapotec tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``These rugs can last 100 years,'' she says with satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO GET THERE: Hire a taxi, take a city bus or sign up for a
tour at your hotel in Oaxaca to take the 30-minute trip along
Highway 190 to Teotitlan del Valle. The Vasquez Sosa home is on a
cul-de-sac, Privada de Zaragoza.

WHERE MILLENNIUM AND MARRIAGE MEET

OUR RATING: 3{ Stars

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Wedding farces are usually played for broad
laughs; everything that can go wrong does go wrong on what's
supposed to be a bride's perfect day, things like that.
</P>
<P>
   Pupi Avati's droll, melancholy ``The Best Man'' goes for
something a little more focused and compelling. While behavioral
humor and surprise reversals play their parts in this handsome
Italian period piece, emotional specificity and a fine sense of a
lost era's attitudes are the film's most engaging qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Set in a rural town on New Year's Eve 1899, the film plays most
amusingly with naive hopes for the future, as represented by both a
strategic, loveless marriage and optimism about the new century.
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful Francesca Babini (Spanish actress Ines Sastre), the
daughter of financially overextended, rustic aristocrats, is to wed
this day the unappealing Edgardo (David Cantorelli), an aging
playboy whose family wealth is crucial for the Babinis' survival.
Though told from an early age that romantic love is just a dreamy
fiction, strong-willed Francesca would prefer it to the fate she's
about to be sealed into.
</P>
<P>
   When Edgardo's best man Angelo (Diego Abantantuono) arrives from
America at the last moment, Francesca sees her out. Not only
soulfully attractive and impeccably groomed, the former local
bricklayer has reportedly made a fortune across the sea. It's love
at first sight, as far as she's concerned, but the sad-eyed Angelo
has another agenda. He wants to find his lost first love, driving
the desperate Francesca to increasingly embarrassing outbursts.
</P>
<P>
   Social traditions are flipped upside down as the day turns to
eve and the century runs out. Not only is Francesca behaving in
ways a new bride definitely should not, but guests are getting
drunker. Inevitably, class prejudices _ which will certainly
disappear from the Earth, as will war, in the enlightened 1900s _
shed their genteel couchings. Above all, money and love drive all
considerations, as they have since time began and will no matter
what changes new millennia bring.
</P>
<P>
   Avati, who likes to make films in Italy's northern Emilia
region, where he's lived most of his life, based a lot of the
events in ``The Best Man'' on stories passed down from his
great-grandparents' generation. That rings true. Though ever so
slightly, carefully heightened, the film's characters and events
are so solidly presented and clearly delineated that they transport
you into their unhappily wedded world with almost unnoticed ease.
</P>
<P>
   It's some party, worth attending for the people-watching alone.
There's a slightly addled, virginity-obsessed aunt; a gloriously
in-denial mother of the bride; three young brothers, all priests,
who are thrilled to watch the New Year's ball they dare not
participate in; and many other swiftly, deftly drawn characters
that shine with human veracity even as they waltz through the
monkeyshines of romantic farce. Farce with an exquisitely
well-constructed poker face.

 &HT;    Bloody `Blade' is strictly O-negative
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only thing that's remotely cutting-edge about ``Blade'' is
the buckets of F/X gore with which it douses its audience.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, this is a distressingly generic comic book movie that
may do a lot for Wesley Snipes' bank account but does nothing to
enhance his fading stature as an actor. Frankly, I miss the Snipes
of ``Mo' Better Blues,'' ``New Jack City'' and ``Rising Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Introduced by Marvel Comics in the early 1970s, Blade (Snipes)
is a superhero with a whopping identity problem. His mother was
bitten by a vampire and died giving birth to him. Half vampire,
half human, Blade can withstand sunlight but also has a taste for
blood.
</P>
<P>
   He's devoted his life to hunting down vampires. He does this
with the help of an impressive arsenal of sci-fi gadgets, a really
cool leather coat and Kris Kristofferson, his mentor-sidekick,
who's like a high-tech Gabby Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   Blade's nemesis is a strutting young vampire named Deacon Frost
(Stephen Dorff, reprising his ``City of Angels'' bad-boy act).
Frost wasn't born a vampire; he was ``turned,'' i.e., bitten. But
he has big plans to overthrow the vampire-by-blood aristocracy and
become the leader of a new vampire nation. And those plans include
Blade.
</P>
<P>
   The niftiest thing about the movie is how it honors its comic
book origins. That is, like the best of Marvel, it goes to
considerable trouble to set up the world in which Blade and Frost
exist. The film spells out its complex vampire mythology _ not just
a matter of stakes and mirrors _ and sticks to it.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, those same superhero origins prove its downfall.
It's one thing to spend an hour or so following the nonstop slash
'n' gnash exploits of a tormented vampire hunter in a comic book.
It's another to sit through two hours of shock tactics (needles,
veins, trashed throats) that become more repetitive as the movie
goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Snipes has a powerful iconic presence, no question. But the
question is, is a franchise really all he wants? It seems a waste
of a good actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blade''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Wesley Snipes and Stephen Dorff. Directed by Stephen
Norrington. Rated R for extreme violence and strong language. 2
hours.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Doesn't cut it.

`BLADE' CAN BE BLOODY INCOHERENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2{ Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Blade, the title hero of Wesley Snipes' gory new
action movie, is a more living than dead member of the living dead.
His mother was bitten and infected by a vampire shortly before
giving him birth, and he's devoted his superpowered existence to
ridding the Earth of the bloodsucking scum.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately, then, ``Blade'' is suspended between horror film
and martial-arts blowout. Less appropriately, it straddles the line
between good and bad moviemaking to an ultimately frustrating
degree.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by makeup effects specialist Stephen Norrington and
based on the Marvel comic book, ``Blade'' boasts the steel-cold,
night-shrouded urban look that's become de rigueur for '90s
superhero movies.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not all the film borrows from ``Batman,'' ``Spawn''
and ``The Crow.'' There's the conflicted, alienated and obsessive
hero bit; the story structure that hurtles from one overproduced
action set piece to another with deadening, pointlessly
hard-to-follow plot information slathered in between; and, of
course, a villain who is Evil Personified and a beautiful, innocent
woman who turns out to possess pretty good bad-guy kicking chops
when she has to.
</P>
<P>
   The lady in question is Karen Jenson (the talented,
underutilized N'bushe Wright), a hospital doctor who gets nipped by
a biker vampire (Donal Logue) Blade recently barbecued. Our hero,
decked out in a Kevlar muscle suit, saves her from certain doom,
but uncertain doom still looms _ it'll be a couple of nights before
the fang virus takes, if it's going to.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Karen devotes what may be her last hours of humanity to
curing Blade _ he takes an increasingly ineffective elixir to
suppress his blood thirst _ and helping him and his aging
weapons-maker Whistler (Kris Kristofferson, who is unaccountably
getting a lot of work these days) fight the vampire conspiracy. And
what a conspiracy it is: Evidently, the nightstalkers have been in
cahoots with powerful humans for centuries, own the police and lots
of stocks, and tend to run their demonic netherworld with corporate
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Except that some rift has developed between traditional vampires
(whatever they are) and the new breed of unhinged undead
exemplified by Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), a post-grunge
power-seeker who not only wants to take over Bite Inc. but bring
some kind of super blood demon back to life. Or something like
that; by the time we get to the climactic ceremony, there's been so
much incoherent kung fu, arcane mythology and gratuitous kinkiness
scattered about that it's impossible to decipher what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when ``comic book'' meant ``easy to understand''? Those
days are gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blade'' certainly has its grotesque pleasures, if you're into
that sort of thing. An opening sequence in a vampire disco brings
the whole alt/rock/lifestyle idea to strobingly vivid afterlife. A
disgustingly obese creepazoid, courtesy of Oscar-winning makeup
effects artist Greg Cannom, fries up real icky when exposed to UV
rays. And if you don't think he just looks silly, Snipes models
Blade's fetishy fightsuit and deploys his silver-dipped arsenal
with swaggering dash. Snipes' impressive martial-arts abilities
have never had a better showcase, either.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, ``Blade'' is too derivative and too mannered
(Norrington changes camera speeds and jump cuts for that very hip,
1980s MTV effect) to provide the potent fantasy fix blood-and-guts
film fans hunger for.

PATHS CROSS DELIGHTFULLY IN `WONDERLAND'

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you've ever heard Astrud Gilberto sing
``Corcovado'' with Stan Getz's plaintive, seductive saxophone
whispering in the background, you know the mood writer-director
Brad Anderson is trying to evoke in his feature debut, ``Next Stop
Wonderland.'' Melancholy. Wistful. Meditative. Beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's film is a romance that's as much about being alone as
it is a study on what brings two people together. It features a
terrific lead performance by Hope Davis, who plays Erin, a woman
content with solitude but unable to rid herself of the idea that
her life would be a little better if she shared it with a soulmate.
</P>
<P>
   Across Boston lives Alan (Alan Gelfant), a decent man who would
be perfect for Erin. Their paths frequently cross during the movie,
but Anderson and co-writer Lyn Vaus keep them tantalizingly apart.
The tension slowly builds until ... well, we'll keep that a secret.
Let's just say that, like the rest of this wonderful movie, the
payoff is anything but a Valentine's Day cliche.
</P>
<P>
   When we first meet Erin, she's being dumped by her tree-hugging
boyfriend of several years who thoughtfully _ and hilariously _
leaves a videotape detailing ``Six Points of Why I'm Leaving You.''
Erin is devastated, and her romantically obsessed mother (the
always splendid Holland Taylor) isn't too happy either, although
she could never understand why her beautiful daughter took up with
that ``communist'' in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Mom has placed a personal ad in a Boston newspaper for her
daughter. ``Frisky, cultured, with a zest for life,'' it begins. It
doesn't exactly describe Erin, mired as she is in a funk. But it's
the Erin that Mom remembers.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Erin is embarrassed _ but she's also intrigued. When
she calls her voice mail, she finds 64 men have responded. Still,
Erin isn't exactly floating on air. She's realistic enough to know
that while you always have a choice in dating, it's usually a
pretty weak selection from which to choose. Naturally _ and quite
humorously _ she is proved correct when she begins to meet her slew
of singles.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Alan doesn't have much time for romance, as he's
working his way through classes in marine biology and volunteering
at the Boston Aquarium. Alan doesn't want to spend his life being a
plumber, nor does he want to end up like his father, a drunk
gambling away his last 10 bucks at a dog track. So he's trying to
reinvent what seems to be his preordained life.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson weaves these two characters' stories together
seamlessly, sometimes putting them in the same place, sometimes
affording them the same company, but at different times. He has
also populated his movie with a colorful supporting cast that
includes Jose Zuniga as Erin's irresistible Brazilian suitor and
Robert Klein as a tough guy who has criminal designs on the
aquarium's prized puff fish. (Think what happens when a needle hits
a balloon.)
</P>
<P>
   But ``Next Stop Wonderland'' (named after a stop on the Boston
subway line) is a lot more than a sappy ``will-they-or-won't-they''
romance. Anderson has filmed the movie much like a documentary,
using hand-held cameras and minimal lighting that gives his story
an honesty and rawness absent from most romantic comedies.
</P>
<P>
   And the movie's well-developed themes of fate and destiny,
solitude and companionship anchor the film with interesting
dialogue and ideas. Then there's the ever-present soundtrack, songs
like ``Corcovado'' and other lovely bossa nova classics (a lot of
Antonio Carlos Jobim) that nicely underscore the bittersweet action
taking place on the screen. All these aspects _ the writing,
direction, soundtrack and performances _ coalesce into something
quite delightful, a romantic comedy with a brain.
</P>
<P>
   That's the wonder of ``Wonderland.'' And like the cool melodies
of the samba, it proves quite seductive indeed.

 &HT;    Deft `Dance' is light on its feet
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to Hollywood, Jamaica and Cuba are busy cultivating
sensitive men with perfect torsos whose sole purpose in life is to
rejuvenate driven, single American mothers.
</P>
<P>
   That's the familiar plot of ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back'' _
oops, sorry, make that ``Dance With Me.'' As slick a fantasy as the
similarly themed Angela Bassett flick, ``Dance'' has a couple of
major advantages over the Terry McMillan adaptation: Director Randa
Haines (``Children of a Lesser God'') knows her movie is fluff, and
she delivers it with candy-colored flair.
</P>
<P>
   Plus there's the movie's hip-swiveling, Latin-rhythm soundtrack,
which keeps it pulsing despite co-choreographer Daryl Matthews'
brain-dead script.
</P>
<P>
   Giving Bassett a run for Least Likely Single Gal of 1998,
Vanessa L. Williams plays Ruby, a Houston dance instructor. She
hopes to recapture the glory of a Las Vegas competition six years
ago, when she won the title dancing with Julian (Rick Valenzuela),
a jerk who got her pregnant, then ditched her.
</P>
<P>
   Though Williams is top-billed, the movie belongs more to Rafael
(Latin music star Chayanne), a Cuban newcomer to Houston whose
heart is as big as his pecs. He's welcomed into the home of John
Burnett (Kris Kristofferson), owner of the studio where Ruby works
and a dancer who, 30 years ago, worked on the same cruise ship with
Rafael's mom. Hmmmm ...
</P>
<P>
   Rafael putters around the studio, watching Ruby and other
students (including Joan Plowright and ``Ally McBeal's'' Jane
Krakowski) rehearse for the Vegas competition. And we wait a little
too long for the inevitable to begin. We know Ruby and Rafael will
be attracted to each other, fight it, then give in. We already know
the choreography and every single step this kind of movie has in
store. Luckily, for the last 40 minutes, the familiar blueprint
can't spoil the joys of performance, as the characters try out
their moves in Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Haines rarely lets reality weigh things down. She gives us a
Cuba bursting with colorful street life and lusty musicians. Even
Houston's Greyhound bus station, bustling with sailors and cowboys,
could be something out of a '90s ``On the Town.'' This is the sort
of retro guilty pleasure that has a Cuban friend of Rafael's assure
him, ``You never leave Cuba.'' And on spying Ruby practicing a
routine in silence, Rafael asks, ``How do you dance without music?
It comes from the music. I'm sure that's why you look so stiff.''
Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael, you see, is the one who has to teach this by-the-book
professional that real dancing comes from the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Original it isn't, but ``Dance'' is great fun. It's the first
film that lets Williams show off her knockout moves; there's a
wonderful scene at a salsa club where she's whirled from partner to
partner in the improvised, communal dance. Meanwhile, in his first
Hollywood flick, Chayanne goes for the summer's heartthrob title.
His Rafael is courtly and charming, and he even manages to pull off
a ``Singin' in the Rain'' homage with its own sweetly comic spin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dance With Me'' doesn't use dancing as a pointed social
metaphor, like the cartoonish ``Strictly Ballroom'' or the sweet,
melancholy ``Shall We Dance?'' But by the end it presents a lovely,
if fantastic, image of dance as the thing that can set aside all
barriers of age, race or economic differences. The original, better
title was ``Shut Up and Dance.'' When the movie takes that advice
and drops the silly dialogue, it's so light on its feet that you
can't begrudge the helium in its head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dance With Me''

 &HT;    Packaging keeps `Dead Man' alive
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kamikaze frat boy Cliff (Lochlyn Munro) likes to dangle by one
hand from his third-floor windowsill and lead cops on high-speed
chases. His idea of etiquette is to unzip his fly and offer his
services after he accidentally sets a coed's hair on fire.
</P>
<P>
   He's not your idea of a great college roommate. But scholarship
student Josh (Tom Everett Scott) and rich boy Cooper (Mark-Paul
Gosselaar) hope he'll share their dorm suite. And, preferably, kill
himself in one of his misadventures. For them, it would mean a
reprieve from certain expulsion. That's because an odd clause at
their college gives students an automatic 4.0 average if their
roommate offs himself.
</P>
<P>
   That's the pleasantly sick premise behind ``Dead Man on
Campus.'' It's angling to be a hybrid of ``Heathers'' and ``Animal
House'' for the '90s. But it lacks the genuine satiric darkness of
the former and the exuberant yuks of the latter. What it does have
is attractive packaging, some energetic performances and a sharp
eye for contemporary college types.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff is a timeless portrait of good ol' boy gone rotten, and
Munro manages to steal every scene he's in with his wacked-out
enthusiasm for the bad life. (Imagine a young Gary Busey on PCP.)
Among the other students whom Josh and Coop audition as potential
suicides are a gloomy British death rocker (Corey Page) and a
computer nerd (Randy Pearlstein) convinced that Bill Gates wants to
steal his brain.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the two lead characters aren't as interesting as
these guys. That's not the fault of the actors. Scott does well as
a decent Joe lured away from his books into long nights of beer,
bongs and bedding a blond dish (Poppy Montgomery). And Gosselaar
brings zip to his role of Josh's corrupter, a post-prep student so
cheerfully irresponsible that he doesn't even realize you're
supposed to keep your voice down in a library. (It's the sort of
part John Cusack would have done in the '80s.)
</P>
<P>
   But the guys are ciphers, there only to serve the high-concept
premise. And since we suspect that the premise will wimp out on any
real follow-through, there's no one to care for, nothing to worry
about.
</P>
<P>
   With its air of slick cynicism, ``Dead Man'' might remind some
people of ``Risky Business.'' But there's a difference. ``Risky
Business'' glorified a moral bankruptcy that reflected the
junk-bond '80s unfolding outside theaters. The smirking (but safe)
nihilism at the heart of this new film is more about sound bites,
marketing and demographics.
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention that MTV Films is one of its co-producers?

   Grade: B-

   Starring Tom Everett Scott and Mark-Paul Gosselaar. Directed by

roll.

 &HT;    A less than friendly group
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you make your feature debut with a film as wickedly
dazzling as last year's ``In the Company of Men,'' a sophomore
slump is almost inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, that's what's happened to writer-director Neil
LaBute. His second movie, ``Your Friends and Neighbors,'' has some
sensational bits and pieces but never completely adds up.
</P>
<P>
   The territory is pretty much the same: sex games people play and
power trips they pull. But this time LaBute widens his net to
include women as well as men. His focus is on six young,
well-educated urbanites. Jerry (Ben Stiller) is a lecherous college
drama teacher, living with tart-tongued Terri (Catherine Keener),
who complains that he talks too much _ especially during sex.
</P>
<P>
   Their good friends Mary (Amy Brenneman) and Barry (Aaron
Eckhart, the cad from ``Men'' with 40 more pounds and a bad
haircut) would seem to have it all. They appear deeply devoted to
each other, have lucrative professional lives and own an apartment
to die for. Yet Barry admits that, as much as he loves Mary, his
best sex is with himself. And Mary is surprisingly open to an
adulterous proposal by Jerry (by now, I hope you've gotten the
rhyming-names joke).
</P>
<P>
   Terri, meanwhile, starts an affair with Cheri (Nastassja
Kinski), a gorgeous art gallery assistant. Finally, there's Cary
(Jason Patric), Barry's best friend. A kind of leftover from the
slash-and-burn ``Men,'' Cary is a doctor who practices pillow talk
into his tape recorder and sends a woman who's made him angry a
false notice that she tested HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute hasn't lost his knack for lacerating dialogue and brutal
black comedy. In one scene, Cary absently tosses a plastic fetus
around like a football. In another, Jerry has a heart-to-heart with
Barry while dressed for a Restoration comedy.
</P>
<P>
   On the chilly side, there's Cary's monologue about the best sex
he ever had: a high school gang rape of a male student. The story
may or may not be true, but it has an acid ring.
</P>
<P>
   But there's something missing here. A sense of cohesiveness or,
perhaps, of cumulative effect. ``Your Friends and Neighbors'' is
smart, funny and cynical. But despite the efforts of its cast
(Patric excluded), it's never as smart, funny or cynical as it
thinks it is. What's lacking is some first-rate Neil LaBute; what's
in its place is some second-rung Woody Allen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your Friends and Neighbors''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>

 &HT;    A mystical man-and-beast story
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You can't get lost in Egypt,'' says Augustin Robert (Ben
Daniels), a resplendent young captain in Napoleon's army. ``There's
the Nile, and there's the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Famous last words. As we see in ``Passion in the Desert,'' a
striking, strangely lyrical film based on a novella by Honore de
Balzac, the arrogant captain gets very, very lost. Body and soul,
mind and heart.
</P>
<P>
   Augustin is with the French army in Egypt as part of the
emperor's doomed 1798 campaign. A sudden sandstorm separates him
from the rest of the troop. On his own, Augustin is soon going in
circles. Finding refuge in some huge, ancient ruins, he discovers
that he's not alone. From the dark stare a pair of luminous feline
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the movie truly begins. The eyes belong to a
gorgeous and solitary she-leopard. Instead of killing him _
leopards are fully capable of and occasionally inclined to eating
human flesh _ she leads him to a water hole and shares her fresh
kill. Before long, the two are in _ well, there's really no other
word for it _ a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Their bond is undeniably sexualized. Not in the sense of
bestiality, but in the way Augustin becomes immediately jealous
when a male leopard intrudes. Or in the way he paints himself with
clay to look like his leopard love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passion'' is the sort of movie you either go along with or you
don't. Those who don't care for animals or can't buy into
Augustin's desert delirium will probably snicker. But others,
especially animal lovers, will be fascinated by the inexplicable
and wondrous connection presented here: how she caresses his cheek
with her sheathed claws, the way he licks her silken shoulder.
First-time director Lavinia Currier isn't afraid of the primitive
mystery at the core of Balzac's story. She embraces it with a
spellbinding visual fluidity that includes long, wordless stretches
reminiscent of the island scenes in ``The Black Stallion.''
</P>
<P>
   With his catlike eyes, lithe, athletic body and leonine mane of
blond hair, British actor Daniels is well-cast as someone just
itching to discover his inner cat-person. Moreover, he's equally
convincing in both his Napoleonic and natural states.
</P>
<P>
   He also deserves some kind of special medal for on-camera
courage. That's really Daniels in all those up-close-and-personal
scenes with the three jungle cats (raised in captivity) that share
his co-star's role. No stunt double here. No digital
special-effects leopard.
</P>
<P>
   A love story as well as a typically Balzacian take on the
shortcomings of so-called civilized man (the French soldiers pass
the time shooting the nose off a sphinx), ``Passion'' is hardly a
costume version of ``That Darn Cat.'' Rather, it's a unique and
daringly original film. And if you have a leopard-skin coat in your
closet, leave it behind. You'll never make it out of the theater
alive. And rightly so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passion in the Desert''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Daniels. Directed by Lavinia Currier. Rated PG-13
for violence and nudity. 1 hour, 33 minutes.

man and beast.

 &HT;    A somber and articulate drama that examines the battle scars of
World War I
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The madness of war and how it creates madness in men is the
subject of ``Regeneration,'' a literate and somber Scottish film
that has been smartly positioned to capitalize on the ``Saving
Private Ryan'' overflow.
</P>
<P>
   Working from Pat Barker's reality-based, Booker Prize-winning
novel, director Gillies MacKinnon (``The Playboys'') takes us to
World War I, also known as ``the Great War.'' And though we see
plenty of muddy, torn-up battlefields and bloody, corpse-strewn
trenches, the horror of combat is conveyed less through images than
through the unforgettable words of British soldier-poets Siegfried
Sassoon and Wilfred Owen.
</P>
<P>
   The year is 1917 and the place is a different kind of
battlefront. In a castle-turned-hospital outside Edinburgh,
shellshocked British officers are ministered to by a staff of
military doctors and nurses. Their job is to make these men well,
restoring them to sanity so they can be shipped back to the
insanity of battle.
</P>
<P>
   The movie concentrates on a doctor and three patients. Dr.
Rivers (Jonathan Pryce) is a compassionate psychiatrist. An officer
himself, he's beginning to have doubts about ``regeneration,'' the
army term for efficiently recycling shattered souls.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers' most glamorous patient is Sassoon (James Wilby). A
celebrated poet and war hero, Sassoon has thrown away his medals
and written a very public declaration against the war. In order to
discredit him, the top brass have sent him to Rivers, charging the
doctor not to seek a cure _ Sassoon is obviously sane _ but to make
him recant.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the premises are Owen (Stuart Bunce), a fledgling poet
whose work Sassoon encourages, and Billy Prior (Jonny Lee Miller),
a working-class officer whose muteness says as much about his
background as it does about war.
</P>
<P>
   The movie makes one crucial mistake: It tries to honor all these
characters' stories, thus diffusing its impact. Still,
``Regeneration'' is an often searing and always articulate film,
one graced with excellent acting and an innate respect for the
complex moral dilemmas it presents. If we feel, by the end, that
the picture accomplishes less than it might, it's only because it
sets out to do so much.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it's well worth the price of a ticket just to hear some
of the dialogue. For instance, at their initial meeting, Owen tells
Sassoon, ``Sometimes, in the trenches, you get a sense of something
ancient ... as if all the other wars had distilled themselves into
this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Spielberg's kinetic camera could hardly put it better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regeneration''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jonathan Pryce, James Wilby and Jonny Lee Miller.
Directed by Gillies MacKinnon. Not rated, but includes nudity,
strong language and violence. At Phipps. 1 hour, 53 minutes.

   The verdict: A sober and articulate examination of the battle
scars left by World War I.

 &HT;    Skin-deep rage fuels a tale of two sisters
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Under the Skin'' made my skin crawl.
</P>
<P>
   Because it was written and directed by a woman and has female
protagonists, it has been heralded as a terrific example of the
female perspective. Now I know how intelligent guys feel when
demographic studies insist they're supposed to get a testos-
</P>
<P>
   terone surge watching ``Armageddon.''
</P>
<P>
   Winner of the critics' award at the 1997 Toronto Film Festival,
Carine Adler's movie introduces us to two sisters living in
Liverpool, England. Iris (Samantha Morton) is a headstrong waif
with a Jean Seberg haircut and an enormous capacity for self-pity.
Her older sister, Rose (Claire Rushbrook from ``Secrets and
Lies''), is married and pregnant. When their mother (Rita
Tushingham, a mainstay of early-'60s British cinema) announces that
she's ill with a brain tumor, the pair react characteristically.
Rose worries that her child will never know her grandmother, while
Iris worries that her mom is ``going to die and she hasn't even
noticed me yet.''
</P>
<P>
   How these two deal with their mother and with each other
constitutes the rest of the film. But we spend most of our time
with Iris, who pretty much flips out and, like the protagonist in
``Breaking the Waves,'' seeks some sort of validation or
self-annihilation through a series of casual sexual encounters,
each more dangerous than the last.
</P>
<P>
   Known from her work on British television (``Jane Eyre'' and
``Tom Jones''), Morton delivers a deeply felt if somewhat
incoherent performance. That's less her fault than the script's,
which never makes clear why she does what she does. Rose's
character is similarly opaque. Apparently all we need to know is
that she's pregnant and she's not as cute as her sister.
</P>
<P>
   For all its sexual tough talk _ Iris narrates her quickies as if
she were auditioning for ``The Red Shoe Diaries'' _ ``Under the
Skin'' is just a punked-out variation on the old ``women's movie''
plot in which sister rivals end up weeping in each other's arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the Skin''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samantha Morton. Directed by Carine Adler. Not

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Is there some kind of rule that all dance movies
have to be stupid?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently. You have to go back 21 years, to when ``Saturday
Night Fever'' separated this marginally more realistic subgenre
from the movie musical fantasy format, to find an American picture
that didn't equate fancy footwork with mental flatlining.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, a few foreign efforts (``Le Bal,'' ``Strictly
Ballroom'') have approached the subject with some wit and
intelligence. But even last year's Japanese import ``Shall We
Dance?'' stuck to the standard pattern of substituting cute
eccentricity for character, sentimental schmaltz for drama and yet
another make-or-break dance display for narrative drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dance With Me'' follows the formula. Thinly drawn characters
unleash their passion, passion, passion by twirling around and
competing for trophies for twirling around. Director Randa Haines
(``Children of a Lesser God'') sets the predictable proceedings to
a felicitous Latin beat, but enchanting music and sometimes-great
choreography can't dance around the fact that the storytelling here
is all left feet.
</P>
<P>
   Chayanne, the swoon-inducing Latino pop star, works his megawatt
smile and too-nice-to-be-true personality overtime as Rafael, a
young man from Cuba who comes to Houston seeking to bond with the
father he's never known. It's obvious from the film's first scene
that that man is Kris Kristofferson's John, but it's typical of
choreographer-screenwriter (and if that's not a hyphenate from
hell, what could be?) Daryl Matthews' script that the
acknowledgment of this relationship is ham-fistedly held off until
the third act.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, all the gals at John's scruffy dance studio are ga-ga
over Rafael, except for star instructor Ruby (Vanessa L. Williams).
A single mom whose mind is on getting back into the competitive
sport dance circuit she fled after a bad romance, the last thing
she needs is a distracting pretty boy.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he does have good moves for a guy with no technical
background. Even if he's never anything short of the perfectly
solicitous gentleman. Even if he's clearly devoted to rocking her
world and hers alone.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ruby's really gonna dance her way out of this one.
</P>
<P>
   A few lame subplots and adorable noncharacters toodle around the
central story lines (Joan Plowright, for example, supplies her
patented, aged impishness as _ what else? _ a widow whose life is
reinvigorated by dance and Rafael-lust).
</P>
<P>
   But the only things that really make this overlong movie worth
sitting through are the dance numbers, especially the vigorous
final ballroom competition and a madly syncopated casino salsa
(featuring a dozen astonishingly athletic L.A. dance club habitues)
that's a mini-masterpiece of barely controlled chaos. The
soundtrack, at its best when emphasizing the Afro-Cuban
pyrotechnics of acts like Albita and Dark Latin Groove, is
relentlessly catchy.
</P>
<P>
   And Chayanne and Williams do what they can with their thinly
drawn characters, generally investing them with emotional
seriousness the scenario doesn't support. He, however, would be
more believable if he behaved just a little less wonderfully, and
she needs to expand her repertoire of dancing facial expressions
beyond just delighted surprise or agonized determination.

AS THEY SAY IN MASSACHUSETTS, PRESIDENT WHO?

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The latest from the Clinton vacation watch: On
Wednesday my father was walking on a beach near his home in
Falmouth, Mass., and saw a man with a giant telescope trained
across Vineyard Sound at Martha's Vineyard. ``Do you see him?''
cracked my dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who?'' said the man.
</P>
<P>
   Someone doesn't know. That's reassuring. Or Yankee humor.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Bill, sorry I forgot your birthday on Wednesday.
Something came up, like the complete demoralization of the country.
I was going to get you a tie, but never mind.
</P>
<P>
   This just in from the Falmouth Enterprise: Alan Dershowitz was
spotted on a nude beach on Martha's Vineyard. The newspaper implied
it was a horrifying sight, but didn't say whether or not he was
wearing clothes.
</P>
<P>
   In other Massachusetts news, columnist Mike Barnicle resigned
from the Boston Globe. He was already suspended for stealing jokes
(crummy ones) from George Carlin. This time he was accused of
inventing two children with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The really embarrassing part for Barnicle is that he was nailed
by the Reader's Digest, whose fact-checkers couldn't find the kids
when the magazine wanted to reprint the column.
</P>
<P>
   See, the Reader's Digest is in the business of cannibalizing
stories. They have to be pro fact-checkers.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad enough to go to the dentist to get your teeth drilled
without reading fake tear-jerkers while you're waiting.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We are woman, see us fly: My buddy Ed Beitiks flew from Chicago
to the San Francisco airport on Monday, and discovered something
special in the air. United Flight 143 had an all-female crew, all
based in San Francisco: Capt. Lynne Evans-Sleeper, First Officer
Amy Parsons, Chief Purser Gieselia Baker and flight attendants
Janet Guerere, Joyce Schlegel, Heather McKinley, Leanna Moore and
Hayley Ludken.
</P>
<P>
   Ludken was part of an all-female crew four months ago, but said,
``It's still very rare. We all feel pretty proud about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The best part of this progress in the air: When it was announced
that the crew was all female, there was absolutely no reaction from
the passengers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I promised myself I wouldn't do license plate items anymore, but
this one is too only-in-you-know-where. I pulled up behind a Honda
CR-V baby four-wheel drive with the license plate ``LVFR RDI.''
Live free or die. He could get that on his plate for free if he
moved to New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The license-plate holder said, ``We need patriots, not more
diversity.'' A Montana militiaman? I don't think so. The driver of
the all-American made-in-Japan car was a middle-aged Asian man.
Sorry, that was one diverse message he was driving around.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just a few Clinton outtakes: First, many readers complained
about the front page in Tuesday's San Francisco Examiner. It showed
Bill Clinton with the headline ``The Face of Shame.'' It was an
inaccurate headline. The guy showed no shame at all.
</P>
<P>
   Margo St. James, the one person in the world who never lied
about sex (just ask her), called from her island retreat in
Washington state, and she was angry at Bill Clinton. ``He's setting
a bad example for kids on safe sex,'' said San Francisco's famous
prostitutes-rights activist. ``If he'd used a condom ...''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, this item has been interrupted for reasons of taste. I
just hate using obscene 20-letter words like ``deoxyribonucleic
acid.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the same lines, the word is that the Gap had a big rush on
dresses when it was learned that Monica had bought her famous dress
there. Ah, for the days of Nixon, when the only gap was the 18
1/2-minute one.
</P>
<P>
   Now that we know everything about Monica, right down to the ties
that bind, national attention has turned to Hillary. Was that angry
body language on the way to vacation just an act? Was she totally
surprised by Bill's admission of misbehavior, or as John Stevens
puts it, is she a guilty bystander?
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter anymore? As the man with the telescope looking at
Martha's Vineyard said, ``Who?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON The Sunday after Congress began its August recess,
two senators led eight House members and four House candidates on a
sweep through Silicon Valley and Seattle in search of enlightenment
and cash.
</P>
<P>
   For two days, they sat through intense briefings on economics,
technology and political desires by very rich computer gurus and
venture capitalists from such firms as CNet, Yahoo!, Applied
Materials, Affymetrix, ETrade, Sun, USWeb, NetNoir,
Hewlett-Packard, Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, E-Loan and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this sense that this is the New World, and we want to
learn about it, `` Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., said in a statement
about the West Coast swing arranged by him and Sen. Jeff Bingaman,
D-N.M.
</P>
<P>
   In between the briefings, they squeezed in social events at
which the briefers and their friends gave $150,000 to the New
Democrat Network, a Washington-based fund-raising group that raises
money for pro-business Democrats in tough races.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the many mechanisms that Democrats and Republicans
alike have used to raise more than $3 million since January 1997
from the nation's 50 most generous computer companies. The
technology leaders, once disparaged by politicians as people ``with
deep pockets and short arms,'' are being courted more than ever
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Rosenberg, who runs the New Democrat Network, said, ``In
many ways we represent what (top computer executives) want:
fiscally responsible fiscal policies and socially tolerant social
policies. ``
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also mine for the computer industry's gold. Senate
Banking Chairman Al D'Amato, R-N.Y., collected 39 contributions
worth $37,500 on a similar visit last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which gave $511,899, topped the list of generous
computer companies compiled by the non-partisan Center for
Responsive Politics in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Others investing at least $100,000 include Electronic Data
Systems of Plano, Texas; Oracle of Redwood Shores, Calif.; Gateway
2000 of North Sioux City, S.D.; Cisco Systems of San Jose; J.D.
Edwards of Denver, and CDB Infotek, a California firm which has
since been acquired by ChoicePoint of Alpharetta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   On a monthly basis, contributions from the top 50 computer firms
are averaging more than $195,000. That's less than the
record-setting $211,000 monthly average for 1995-96, but a big jump
over other non-presidential election cycles.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, before the global explosion of the World Wide
Web created a new generation of WWWillionaires with a new set of
political concerns, the monthly average for the top 50 was below
$118,000.
</P>
<P>
   The best known political buddies of generous high tech tycoons
are two veteran Democratic schmoozers, President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore, who are utterly at home with the industry's
chat-now, pay-later approach.
</P>
<P>
   But the nonpartisan center's studies indicate that Republicans
have gotten about 58 cents out of every political dollar the top 50
companies have handed out since January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the GOP is doing better than ever at convincing
computer executives to donate the kind of unregulated ``soft
money'' contributions that would be outlawed under a House-passed
bill pending before the Senate. The Republican share has ballooned
from 33 percent of the $1.3 million given by computer companies in
1995-96 to 54 percent of $1.5 million raised in 1997 and early
1998.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who was briefed in Silicon
Valley in June, is expected back later in August to collect some of
the $20 million he wants the nation's businesses to pony up for the
GOP's fall campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year and a half, an alliance of 150 technology
executives who call their group TechNet has briefed more than 50
members of Congress and raised funds for at least 18 of the
Democrats and 10 of the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to take it for granted that political figures
who didn't grow up in the technology industry understand how
important it is, how fragile it is, how complex,'' said Reed
Hastings, president of TechNet. ``We're bringing them to Palo Alto,
to Seattle, to Boston, to Virginia. A similar effort is being
organized in Austin. High tech is much broader than Silicon Valley,
you know.''
</P>
<P>
   He said they give the office-holders money because ``after you
make an investment of time in having them understand the issues . .
.you want to keep them elected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every special interest group feels that way,'' said analyst
Jennifer Schechter at the Center for Responsive Politics. ``What
about the people who disagree with (the computer executives) but
can't afford to pay for face time with policy-makers?''
</P>
<P>
   Hastings responded, ``We're not trying to differentiate on the
basis that (because) we give more money, you pay attention to us.
That's a pretty shallow way of viewing the political process.''

   ``Accountants and trial lawyers and banks and the securities
industry all give tons more money than we do,'' said Wade Randlett,
TechNet's Democratic liaison. ``People come and take part because
it takes a lot of time, words, questions, to discuss the change
from the old economy to the new economy, and (its significance) for
everything from rural development to organ transplants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty sophisticated dialogue, not at all partisan, not
just a one-way lecture,'' said Lezlee Westine, TechNet's GOP
liaison. But she was unable to recall any occasion in which a
public official had changed a high tech executive's mind.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Polese, the CEO of Marimba Inc., a software startup in
Mountain View, Calif., said she finds time for the sessions because
``the high technology industry and our country's future (depend on)
issues such as Internet access for all citizens, individual
privacy, secure communications, and a well-educated,
technology-savvy workforce.''

</P>
<P>
   In California, technology executives who were appalled by the
state's school system won widespread credit this year for a $3
million effort that resulted in passage of a law that will increase
the number of public charter schools in their state.
</P>
<P>
   But in Washington, the influence of the industry's investment is
harder to measure, mostly because Congress and the Clinton
administration have put off deal-making compromises on many bills
until after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   It looks now as if the industry will win its battles for a law
making it harder for disappointed shareholders to use state courts
to sue companies that issued overly optimistic business
projections. Congress is expected to preserve federal subsidies for
Internet links to schools and libraries, though with a requirement
that the institutions install obscenity-blocking software for
optional use.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the industry's adoption of voluntary
privacy-protection codes has convinced Congress and Clinton to wait
and see whether the policies make it unnecessary to use new laws to
protect children and shoppers from exploitation by Internet-using
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also expected to order some loosening of export
controls on software that uses powerful data-scrambling codes. And
he is expected to compromise with congressional Republicans on
higher immigration quotas for highly skilled professionals.
</P>
<P>
   A two-year or three-year ban on new state or local taxes on
Internet use has better than a 50-50 chance to pass.
</P>
<P>
   But final action this year is less likely on the industry's
proposals for lower capital gains taxes, federal standards on
legally binding digital signatures, a new policy on commercial use
of public data bases, much higher spending on university-based
research, enhanced patent protection laws and extra support for the
International Monetary Fund's efforts to salvage the economies of
the high tech industry's Asian customers.
</P>
<P>
   And the prospects are dimming for passage of anti-spamming laws
to protect Internet users from unwanted e-mail and anti-slamming
laws to protect telephone users from phone-service swindlers. Those
popular proposals are in legislation that is blocked by a dispute
within Congress over whether to use telephone taxes or general
revenues to pay for making the Internet available to students and
library patrons.

privacy-protection codes has convinced Congress and Clinton to wait
and see whether the policies make it unnecessary to use new laws to
protect children and shoppers from exploitation by Internet-using
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also expected to order some loosening of export
controls on software that uses powerful data-scrambling codes. And
he is expected to compromise with congressional Republicans on
higher immigration quotas for highly skilled professionals.
</P>
<P>
   A two-year or three-year ban on new state or local taxes on
Internet use has better than a 50-50 chance to pass.
</P>
<P>
   But final action this year is less likely on the industry's
proposals for lower capital gains taxes, federal standards on
legally binding digital signatures, a new policy on commercial use
of public data bases, much higher spending on university-based
research, enhanced patent protection laws and extra support for the
International Monetary Fund's efforts to salvage the economies of
the high tech industry's Asian customers.
</P>
<P>
   And the prospects are dimming for passage of anti-spamming laws
to protect Internet users from unwanted e-mail and anti-slamming
laws to protect telephone users from phone-service swindlers. Those
popular proposals are in legislation that is blocked by a dispute
within Congress over whether to use telephone taxes or general
revenues to pay for making the Internet available to students and
library patrons.

   FILM-GADJO (Undated) The title character of Tony Gatlif's latest
_ and most enjoyable _ examination of Gypsy life, ``Gadjo Dilo''
(Crazy Foreigner), is a determined young Parisian (Romain Duris)
who, as the film opens, is trudging across the frozen outback of
Romania on a personal quest.

<P>
   FILM-REGENERATION (Undated) The setting of Gillies Mackinnon's
well-meaning but terminally dreary period drama, ``Regeneration,''
is a cozy asylum in Scotland where British military doctors treat
shell-shocked World War I soldiers so they can be sent back to the
trenches of France.
</P>
<P>
   By William Arnold. (story will move in the ``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-HANDS (Undated) The documentary ``Hands on a Hard Body''
deals with such an obscure subject _ a contest sponsored by a
smalltown Texas auto-dealer _ that it's probably going to have a
hard time gathering a great deal of initial audience interest.
</P>
<P>
   By William Arnold. (story will move in the ``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-BLADE (Undated) ``Blade,'' gives the vampire thriller
formula some new life by playing it as epic _ in fact, as
apocalyptic epic. In this film, it's the vampires that run the
world, and the underdog humans who have to try and take it back.
</P>
<P>
   By William Arnold. (story will move in the ``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-FRIENDS (Undated) Neil LaBute's second feature, ``Your
Friends and Neighbors,'' is sure to both infuriate (at the preview
screening, three people walked out proclaiming, ``These people are
losers!'') and fascinate.
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (story will move in the ``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-STRIKE (Undated) ``Strike!'' brings to mind the 1966 film,
``The Trouble With Angels,'' which featured rebellious convent
school students, played by Hayley Mills and June Harding, pitted
against Rosalind Russell's stern but kindly Mother Superior.
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (story will move in the ``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-DANCE (Undated) ``A story of hearts in motion'' reads the
tag line for ``Dance With Me,'' and indeed, ``motion'' is the best
thing about it.

<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (story will move in the ``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-DEAD (Undated) Poor Tom Everett Scott. After an impressive
debut in the Tom Hanks movie, ``That Thing You Do,'' the actor has
slowly seen his career take a downward spiral. First it was ``An
American Werewolf In Paris,'' now this odious and tasteless trifle.
Even the opening credits are morose and crass in ``Dead Man On
Campus,'' with various methods of suicide integrated into the cast
and crew's names.

 &HT;    HOLETOWN, Barbados _ Cuba's President Fidel Castro was here
recently as part of his courtship swing through the Caribbean.
Apart from a few grumbling letters to the editor in the local
paper, he was warmly welcomed.
 &HT;    Prime Minister Owen Arthus even compared Cuba's regional role
with China's global role, much too important a market to try to
isolate and therefore well worth cultivating.
 &HT;    A decade ago this reaction was scarcely imaginable. Barbados was
one of the Caribbean countries that applauded the U.S. invasion of
Grenade, not because of President Ronald Reagan's flimsy pretext of
protecting American students but because of real fears of Cuban
attempts to export revolution backed by military force.
 &HT;    Like most of the island states in the region, Barbados was
defenseless. A few hundred Cuban troops could have easily
overwhelmed it, so the clear warning of American landings in
Grenada _ that the U.S. wouldn't allow such Cuban expansion _ came
as a relief to people here.
 &HT;    Castro has not made such dramatic changes in domestic policy as
the late Deng Hsiao-Ping and his successor did in China. He is
still a determined communist revolutionary. But nobody is afraid of
Cuba any more. Even the Pentagon has ruled that Cuba no longer
poses any kind of threat.
 &HT;    This is because of the collapse of the Soviet Union, not only as
the military and economic guarantor of Castro's regime, but also as
an ideological model, now a complete failure. There are still some
Marxists around the region, but there is no chance of their coming
to power.
 &HT;    So Castro's effort to end his country's isolation and become a
full member of the economic, political and cultural neighborhood is
receiving an eager response. The Caribbean comprises mostly very
small countries, proudly independent but quite aware of the need to
combine their negotiating strength if they are to have any weight
in the world.
 &HT;    There is already strong support for getting Cuba accepted as a
member of the Lome agreement, which provides preferential tariffs
in the European Union for what are called ACP countries. These are
former European colonies in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific
whose trade patterns would have been devastated by independence
without some special treatment. Cuba has not been a colony in this
century, but it seems natural for it to have equal status and full
regional ties.
 &HT;    The problem, of course, is the United States and its rigid
anti-Castro policy which it attempts to impose on third countries.
Nobody, outside of some but not all Cuban exiles headquartered in
Miami and die-hards in Washington, sees any point to the continued
embargo on Cuba.
 &HT;    After nearly 40 years, the aim of provoking Castro's downfall
has obviously failed. It has only inflicted serious hardship on the
Cuban people and prevented any Cuban contribution to regional
development.
 &HT;    Now the American policy brings resentment and ridicule from the
rest of the area. It is widely understood that the policy has
become almost entirely a matter of domestic politics, fear of the
rabidly anti-Castro Cuban lobby particularly in the electorally
influential states of Florida and New Jersey.
 &HT;    It is easy to compare it sarcastically to the U.S. policy for
``constructive engagement'' with huge communist China, and to
suggest that America's inconsistency is the disdain of a big power
for a such smaller one.
 &HT;    There is no longer much question about whether Castro, just
turned 72, will disappear fairly soon and, most observers believe,
his regime with him. The question is when and how.
 &HT;    In a normal course of events, internal evolutionary pressures
would produce some kind of ``velvet revolution'' as happened in
Eastern Europe, and the successor regime would be drawn from
critical groups inside Cuba. This kind of peaceful, home-grown
transition would clearly be in the best interests of the Cubans and
of the United States as well.
 &HT;    But there are grounds to suspect this is just what the exile
lobby does not want, since it would almost surely preclude their
return to power on the island. A change involving violence, drawing
in the United States possibly with military support, would better
suit their ambitions.
 &HT;    That is all the more reason why the United States should change
its policy now, cancel the embargo and encourage contacts with the
Cuban population. That would have a lot more influence in helping
Cuba find its way to democracy and regional integration.
 &HT;    Further, there is considerable evidence that the U.S. electorate
including quite a lot of the Cuban immigrants would greet the
change with relief, as Americans did when President Nixon finally
reopened exchanges with communist China. The Cuban lobby still has
a lot of bark, but not much political bite left.
 &HT;    Then why doesn't Washington do it? Two reasons. One is inertia,
the awful time lag it takes for political myth to catch up with
reality. The other can be called Monica Lewinsky, a beleaguered
president feeling unable to take a bold initiative. But the sooner
the policy is changed, the better.
 &HT;     (Flora Lewis is the former foreign-affairs columnist for The
New York Times.)

former European colonies in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific
whose trade patterns would have been devastated by independence
without some special treatment. Cuba has not been a colony in this
century, but it seems natural for it to have equal status and full
regional ties.
 &HT;    The problem, of course, is the United States and its rigid
anti-Castro policy which it attempts to impose on third countries.
Nobody, outside of some but not all Cuban exiles headquartered in
Miami and die-hards in Washington, sees any point to the continued
embargo on Cuba.
 &HT;    After nearly 40 years, the aim of provoking Castro's downfall
has obviously failed. It has only inflicted serious hardship on the
Cuban people and prevented any Cuban contribution to regional
development.
 &HT;    Now the American policy brings resentment and ridicule from the
rest of the area. It is widely understood that the policy has
become almost entirely a matter of domestic politics, fear of the
rabidly anti-Castro Cuban lobby particularly in the electorally
influential states of Florida and New Jersey.
 &HT;    It is easy to compare it sarcastically to the U.S. policy for
``constructive engagement'' with huge communist China, and to
suggest that America's inconsistency is the disdain of a big power
for a such smaller one.
 &HT;    There is no longer much question about whether Castro, just
turned 72, will disappear fairly soon and, most observers believe,
his regime with him. The question is when and how.
 &HT;    In a normal course of events, internal evolutionary pressures
would produce some kind of ``velvet revolution'' as happened in
Eastern Europe, and the successor regime would be drawn from
critical groups inside Cuba. This kind of peaceful, home-grown
transition would clearly be in the best interests of the Cubans and
of the United States as well.
 &HT;    But there are grounds to suspect this is just what the exile
lobby does not want, since it would almost surely preclude their
return to power on the island. A change involving violence, drawing
in the United States possibly with military support, would better
suit their ambitions.
 &HT;    That is all the more reason why the United States should change
its policy now, cancel the embargo and encourage contacts with the
Cuban population. That would have a lot more influence in helping
Cuba find its way to democracy and regional integration.
 &HT;    Further, there is considerable evidence that the U.S. electorate
including quite a lot of the Cuban immigrants would greet the
change with relief, as Americans did when President Nixon finally
reopened exchanges with communist China. The Cuban lobby still has
a lot of bark, but not much political bite left.
 &HT;    Then why doesn't Washington do it? Two reasons. One is inertia,
the awful time lag it takes for political myth to catch up with
reality. The other can be called Monica Lewinsky, a beleaguered
president feeling unable to take a bold initiative. But the sooner
the policy is changed, the better.

`GADJO DILO' IS AN ENJOYABLE LOOK AT GYPSY LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The title character of Tony Gatlif's latest _ and most enjoyable
_ examination of Gypsy life, ``Gadjo Dilo'' (Crazy Foreigner), is a
determined young Parisian (Romain Duris) who, as the film opens, is
trudging across the frozen outback of Romania on a personal quest.
</P>
<P>
   All his life he's been haunted by the plaintive voice of a
Romanian Gypsy singer named Nora Luca, whose songs his amateur
musicologist father recorded many years before. Now that Eastern
Europe has opened up again, he's out to track her down.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his journey, he can find no one who's even heard of
the singer. But about the time his shoes wear out, he finally
stumbles upon a drunken old Gypsy named Izidor (Isidor Serban), who
has not only heard of Nora Luca, but actually claims to know her
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   The old man takes the young Frenchman to spend the night in a
shanty-town Gypsy community that uneasily exists near a larger
Romanian village. After sobering up, the old man remembers nothing
of the illusive singer, but he decides to adopt the Frenchman.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the movie settles into a light-hearted,
culture-clash comedy as the ``crazy stranger'' lingers in the
village _ gradually overcoming the community's knee-jerk suspicion
of him, becoming virtually accepted into the tribe and falling in
love with a beautiful belly dancer (Rona Hartner).
</P>
<P>
   Like the earlier Gypsy films of the Algerian-born, Spanish-Gypsy
director _ ``Les Princes'' (1982), ``Latcho Drom'' (1993) and
``Mondo'' (1995) _ this one has it both ways. It satirizes the
narrowness of Gypsy culture on the one hand, while wildly
romanticizing it on the other as a bastion of eccentric diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Even more than those earlier movies, however, this one is out to
please its audience with happy incidents and lovable characters.
Star Duris is all wide-eyed Gallic affability, Szerban is as wise
and durable as Zorba the Greek, Hartner is a '40s Hollywood vision
of hot-blooded Gypsy sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   It proves to be a fairly irresistible combination. One shocking
incident of ethnic cleansing aside, ``Gadjo Dilo'' is a happy,
funny, overtly sexy and gloriously life-affirming romp of a movie
that has the distinct smell of a major art-house hit.
</P>
<P>
   Gadjo Dilo. Directed and written by Tony Gatlif. Cast: Romain
Duris, Rona Hartner, Isidor Serban. Lions Gate Films. 97 minutes.
In French, Romanian and Gypsy with English subtitles. Unrated.

`REGENERATION' IS A SCATTERED FILM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The setting of Gillies Mackinnon's well-meaning but terminally
dreary period drama, ``Regeneration,'' is a cozy asylum in Scotland
where British military doctors treat shell-shocked World War I
soldiers so they can be sent back to the trenches of France.
</P>
<P>
   The hero is the real-life English war hero and antiwar poet
Siegfried Sassoon (James Wilby), and the story is a fictionalized
account (from a highly acclaimed novel by Pat Barker) of his brief
incarceration there in the wake of his written protest of the war
in 1917.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict comes in the form of his doctor, Dr. William Rivers
(Jonathan Pryce), an eminent, fiftyish psychiatrist whose
assignment is less to judge Sassoon's sanity than to bring the
celebrated poet back to his nationalistic senses.
</P>
<P>
   But the conflict turns out to be not much conflict at all. Far
from being a Nurse Ratched, Dr. Rivers is gentle, kindly,
intelligent and a bit shell-shocked himself from dealing with so
many shell-shock cases. He can get angry at Sassoon's haughtiness,
but he likes and sympathizes with the poet.
</P>
<P>
   And the movie seems to lose interest in Sassoon after the first
act to concentrate on the problems of a more authentically
traumatized and equally rebellious patient (Jonny Lee Miller), who
went bonkers after a comrade was blown to bits beside him.
</P>
<P>
   As it progresses, the film gets even more scattered, moving
haphazardly around other cases in the institution, frequently
flashing back on the carnage in France, demonstrating the various
barbaric shock treatments of the time, and showing the impact of
war on a young widow (Tanya Allen).
</P>
<P>
   The film works best as a mood piece. The visuals _ especially
the numerous rainswept shots of the Scottish Moors in winter _ have
a bleak, haunting, end-of-the-world beauty that combine with the
immaculate period detail to give the film an unusual sense of
authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   It also effectively dramatizes one of the most touching
relationships in 20th century English literature: the friendship
between Sassoon and Wilfred Owen, an aspiring writer he met in this
institution who would posthumously become the Great War's most
famous poetic chronicler.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ``Regeneration'' might have been a more memorable
experience had it focused more of its attention on this
relationship, and less on the other, more familiar and (apparently)
fictional storylines that do nothing but batter our senses and
re-enforce what we already know going in _ that war is hell.
</P>
<P>
   Regeneration. Directed by Gillies Mackinnon. Screenplay by Allan
Scott. Cast: Jonathan Pryce, James Wilby, Jonny Lee Miller, Stuart
Bunce. Alliance Films. 95 minutes. Unrated.

`BLADE' PLAYS THE VAMPIRE THRILLER AS EPIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The vampire thriller is, of course, the most completely
overworked movie genre of the American cinema. It's been played and
replayed so often for comedy, burlesque, exoticism and horror that
it's become, for the most part, a cliche and a bore.
</P>
<P>
   But this week's edition, ``Blade,'' gives the formula some new
life by playing it as epic _ in fact, as apocalyptic epic. In this
film, it's the vampires that run the world, and the underdog humans
who have to try and take it back.
</P>
<P>
   The result is mesmerizing and often a lot of grisly fun. Horror
fans should eat it up, though a more mainstream audience will be
put off by the film's focus on torture, dismemberment and
blood-bathing, as well as teasing references to incest and
pedophilia.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the Marvel comic book, it's the story a stalwart
vampire hunter named Blade (Wesley Snipes) who stalks the noir
urban landscape dispensing justice to the uppity Undead _ via
silver sword, a gun that shoots silver bullets and canisters of
garlic mace.
</P>
<P>
   It's a big job because the vampires are institutionalized. They
have a secret treaty with the U.S. government, they run the LAPD,
and they have billions in offshore bank accounts. They make the
Mafia look like a neighborhood street gang.
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters, it turns out that Blade himself is a
semi-vampire, a ``daywalker'' _ a man with the strength of a
vampire but none of its weaknesses. So he has to keep taking a
special serum or he's likely to ``turn.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's the additional problem of a Gen X renegade vampire
named Deacon (Stephen Dorff) who, by studying the ancient vampire
scriptures, has found a way take control from the vampire
establishment and make himself ruler of the Earth _ if he can find
the blood of a ``daywalker'' to use as part of his ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the premise of the film _ its complicated vampire
mythology, and conventions of what the creatures can and cannot do
_ never really adds up to anything that makes any sense, even by
the liberal standards we apply to vampire fantasies. Try to analyze
this thing and you'll go nuts.
</P>
<P>
   The film also suffers from the casting of Dorff as the vampire
anti-Christ. He's a good actor and he makes a clear visual contrast
to hero Snipes, but his WASPish pretty-boy, boy-next-door presence
makes him altogether about as menacing as Mickey Rooney playing
Andy Hardy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the film is carried by the sweep of its style. Director
Stephen Norrington and his crew create a marvelously paranoid and
incorrigibly morbid comic-book world. The action sequences seem
remarkably original, surreal and exhilarating.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the rest of the casting works. Kris Kristofferson is just
right as Blade's folksy mentor; N'Bushe Wright (``Zebrahead'')
projects just the proper blend of vulnerability and spunk as
Blade's imperiled love interest; and Snipes makes a volatile,
soaringly resolute, splendidly mythic Savior of Mankind.
</P>
<P>
   Blade. Directed by Stephen Norington. Written by David S. Goyer.
Cast: Wesley Snipes, Stephen Dorff, Kris Kristofferson, N'Bushe
Wright. New Line Cinema. 120 minutes. Rated R for violence and
sexual references.

`YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS' WILL INFURIATE, FASCINATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Neil LaBute's second feature, ``Your Friends and Neighbors,'' is
sure to both infuriate (at the preview screening, three people
walked out proclaiming, ``These people are losers!'') and
fascinate.
</P>
<P>
   His ``immorality tale'' about friendship, art, marriage,
relationships and, especially, truth packs a wallop equal to his
first black comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who thought LaBute would soften after searingly exploring
sexual politics and ethics within the corporate hierarchy in his
controversial ``In The Company Of Men,'' is sorely mistaken. If
anything he's gone a step further in risking alienation of the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your Friends and Neighbors'' is dark, entangled, nasty and
altogether possible.
</P>
<P>
   And that's a nod to LaBute's strength as a writer. Purposely
staged as a bawdy Restoration comedy, with a wide lens capturing
all the immoral details between six people who are old
acquaintances and friends, the film rings with emotional resonance
the further away we get in time.
</P>
<P>
   Mary (Amy Brenneman) and Barry (Aaron Eckhart, who gained 40
pounds to play the role) are married and living in their beautiful
new house. Their friends, the couple Terri (Catherine Keener) and
Jerry (Ben Stiller), pay a social call. What appears to be an
innocent visit soon becomes embroiled with darker subtexts.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry makes a pass at Mary and the perfect veneer is stripped
from the facade of both a happy marriage and Jerry and Terri's
romance, revealing the miserable cracks and gouges beneath. Jerry
pursues Mary. Terri becomes involved with a beautiful art gallery
assistant named Cheri (Nastassja Kinski).
</P>
<P>
   Using Jerry and Barry's best friend, Cary (Jason Patric), as the
``purveyor of truth'' and gauge of moral conscience, LaBute has
created a guide through the action who is adept at eviscerating his
friends by tapping into their deepest secrets. He's a solitary
perfectionist, bitingly smart and smugly content in his solitude,
maybe even a little sociopathic. Everyone wants what Cary has and
he thus sets the rhythm for his friend's covetous desires.
</P>
<P>
   It's tricky to ask an audience to like such difficult, abrasive
characters. But, surprisingly, LaBute makes us see the
vulnerability beneath the brittleness. And he's written long, talky
scenes that allow the cast to chew up the scenery and gives the
film a live theater feel. That intimacy, juxtaposed against the
word warfare in which the characters routinely engage, makes ``Your
Friends and Neighbors'' an unusual, difficult, thought-provoking
adventure into modern urban survival.
</P>
<P>
   In making a film that is better than his first movie, LaBute
created a unique and claustrophobic cinema of cruelty and social
commentary that we find riveting, no matter how painful the price.
</P>
<P>
   Your Friends and Neighbors. Directed and written by Neil LaBute.
Cast: Amy Brenneman, Aaron Eckhart, Catherine Keener, Nastassja
Kinski, Jason Patric, Ben Stiller. Gramercy Pictures. 100 minutes.

LOVE STORY AT HEART OF `DANCE WITH ME' IS A DUD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A story of hearts in motion'' reads the tag line for ``Dance
With Me,'' and indeed, ``motion'' is the best thing about it.
</P>
<P>
   While the film is a mix of ``Dirty Dancing'' and ``Strictly
Ballroom,'' with a little ``Lambada'' and ``Staying Alive'' tossed
in, its dance sequences are terrific and crackle with energy and
style.
</P>
<P>
   But the love story at its heart is a resounding dud and the
script is addled with howler lines like, ``How do you dance without
music? It has to come from the music.''
</P>
<P>
   The film seems, at first, an odd choice for director Randa
Haines (``Children Of A Lesser God,'' ``The Doctor''), but then we
recall she also directed the flop ``Wrestling Ernest Hemingway,''
which featured a similar hot, humid atmosphere and a subplot
revolving around a character's obsession with ballroom dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Infante (Chayanne) has left Santiago de Cuba and come to
Houston in search of the man who may be his father. His mother has
just died, leaving Rafael with the address of a man, John Burnett
(Kris Kristofferson), who was the love of her life and with whom
she had a torrid romance two decades earlier.
</P>
<P>
   John owns a rundown dance studio and welcomes Rafael _ though he
doesn't know he's possibly his son _ with open arms. He gives the
young man a job as handyman and Rafael makes a big impression on
the regulars who frequent the Excelsior dance studio.
</P>
<P>
   But one woman, teacher Ruby (Vanessa L. Williams), isn't so
easily won. She is intent upon regaining her standing as the top
International Latin Ballroom dancer at the month-away competition
in Las Vegas and, as a single mom, has little time for flirtation
with a handsome stranger.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael gently breaks down her defenses and teaches her how to
feel the music and loosen up her rigid, disciplined technique. The
two slowly get closer and closer. But in the end, Ruby pulls away,
fearing the feelings she's succumbed to. How can Rafael prove he's
as serious about Ruby as he is about dancing?
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a stranger rolling into town and changing the lives
of everyone in the vicinity is a common cinematic staple.
Unfortunately, ``Dance With Me'' doesn't work on this elemental
level. The intended lovers have little chemistry and the usually
exquisite Vanessa L. Williams is shot so badly that she often looks
scary.
</P>
<P>
   During the climactic scene at the competition in Las Vegas,
we're distracted from enjoying Williams' dancing prowess because
her face looks frighteningly distorted and full of physical pain.
It's like a bad opera. And newcomer Chayanne smiles through the
entire film, utilizing a grin as his main charismatic weapon. In
fact, he smiles more than he dances.
</P>
<P>
   Other supporting characters are equally hammy. English actress
Joan Plowright is on hand as comic relief but her big scene is both
implausible and embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dance With Me'' works best when it relies on the understated
appeal of Kris Kristofferson and on the dancing itself.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, all that fancy footwork doesn't begin until an
hour into the film. But when it finally does, the payoff makes up
for the clich &UR; gfacute &LR; e of a story. The final dance competition is
great fun, and full of whip-cracking verve and stylish
choreography. Still, it only makes what's missing all the more
glaring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dance With Me'' looks great and is full of colorful climate,
but when the dancers aren't on screen, the love story trips all
over its big feet.
</P>
<P>

`DEAD MAN ON CAMPUS' IS MOROSE AND CRASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poor Tom Everett Scott. After an impressive debut in the Tom
Hanks movie, ``That Thing You Do,'' the actor has slowly seen his
career take a downward spiral. First it was ``An American Werewolf
In Paris,'' now this odious and tasteless trifle.
</P>
<P>
   Even the opening credits are morose and crass in ``Dead Man On
Campus,'' with various methods of suicide integrated into the cast
and crew's names.
</P>
<P>
   The story is based on the urban legend that a ``dead man's
clause'' exists on college campuses that says a student will be
awarded a 4.0 grade point average if his or her college roommate
dies by murder, accidental death, violent death or slow death
within the room itself. Different variations on the theme survive,
but suicide is the method of choice in ``Dead Man On Campus.''
</P>
<P>
   Josh (Everett Scott) is a medical student from Indiana who is
putting himself through school on a scholarship. His roommate,
Cooper (Mark-Paul Gosselaar, who is does his best to impersonate
Jim Carrey in ``The Cable Guy'' here), is a rich party boy who
never goes to class and has eked by on his charms.
</P>
<P>
   Josh has to maintain a B+ average to keep his financial aid, but
after a few months with Cooper as his dorm mate, Josh's grades have
slid into the toilet. The pair embark on a scheme to take on a
third roommate _ one who is actively suicidal _ so they can claim
the ``dead man's clause.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair scout for potential candidates, finding three guys who
appear likely to fall off the edge. Cliff (Lochlyn Munro) is a John
Belushi-esque nutcase, Buckley (Randy Pearlstein) is a computer
nerd who wants to assassinate Bill Gates, and Matt (Corey Page) is
a black-hearted musician who sings songs of death.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, ``Dead Man On Campus'' drones on and on with its
one-note premise and the jokes fall flat and become tiresome after
awhile. Plus, it's offensive and inane at the same time. Who wants
to watch a bunch of losers try to off themselves? Even the movie's
protagonists turn out to be a couple of schmucks who find no
redemption and learn no lesson from their schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, Everett Scott will have better luck with his next
film, the Meryl Streep-starrer, ``One True Thing,'' because ``Dead
Man On Campus'' is so unfunny and pointless that it deserves to die
a fast death at the box office.

SEEING `HANDS ON A HARD BODY' IS WORTH VIEWERS' TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The documentary ``Hands on a Hard Body'' deals with such an
obscure subject _ a contest sponsored by a smalltown Texas
auto-dealer _ that it's probably going to have a hard time
gathering a great deal of initial audience interest.
</P>
<P>
   But those who venture into the the film are destined to be
richly rewarded: it's an often brilliant, always totally engrossing
competition movie of the first order, and the best documentary to
appear in a Seattle theater so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it's a movie that digs deep into a milieu that's
usually treated with considerable contempt by films _ the lower
middle-class South _ and presents an ensemble of characters who
prove to be considerably more noble and resourceful than their
stereotypes. In this respect, the film is strangely reminiscent of
``The Apostle.''
</P>
<P>
   The contest is an endurance test involving some 24 contestants
who are picked at random by a Longview, Texas, Nissan dealer from a
barrage of applicants. The contestants stand around a brand new
Nissan truck, keeping one hand on its body at all times. The last
hand remaining on the truck gets to drive it home.
</P>
<P>
   The contestants get a five-minute break every hour, and a
15-minute break every six hours. They can talk among themselves,
read, sing, listen to a Walkman, be interviewed by the local radio
station or by filmmaker S.R. Bindler. But the moment more than one
hand leaves the body of the vehicle, they're disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   The contestants are white, black and Hispanic, old and young,
mostly under-educated. As pre-event interviews are cut into the
narrative, we get to know their aspirations, their training for the
event or lack thereof, their strengths and limitations. Most are in
it for the money, others just want to own the ultimate Texas status
symbol.
</P>
<P>
   There's Benny, the returning champion whose running
philosophical observations are so funny and down-home perceptive
that he deserves his own talk show. And Norma, who's propelled by
the ``joy of the Lord'' and has a 200-person prayer network rooting
for her. And Kelly, a sweet kid who wants to win the truck so she
can sell it and stop waiting tables for a while.
</P>
<P>
   The hours drag on. Ten, 15, 20 hours. A few of the less
determined contestants begin to drop off. Then 30, 40, 50, 60
hours. Bodies get numb. Some contestants become delirious, others
hear voices and break into uncontrollable laughter. More fall away
_ especially the younger ones. ``Age and maturity will win this
thing,'' Benny tells us early on.
</P>
<P>
   As the contest goes on for 70, then 80 and toward 90 hours, the
movie puts us right on the edge of our seats. It uncannily
communicates the camaraderie the participants develop for one
another, the excruciating pain and sadness of dropping out after
such a punishing investment, the unusual reservoir of character
that dwells in the psyche of each of the finalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hands On a Hard Body'' is finally just one terrific
competition movie. It's all here: the thrill of victory, the agony
of defeat, even the heart-pounding, neck-and-neck finish that leads
to the surprise outcome. It may have been shot with home video
cameras on a total budget of under $10, but this little movie
delivers more excitement and drama than any of the summer's $100
million blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
   Hands on a Hard Body. Directed and edited by S.R. Bindler.
Produced by Bindler, Kevin Morris and Chaplin John Wilson.
Documentary. Legacy Releasing. 97 minutes. Unrated.

`REGENERATION' BLASTS ANY NOTION OF GLORIOUS COMBAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY STONE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It is sweet and fitting to die for one's country,'' wrote the
Roman poet Horace, but that sentiment takes its lumps in
``Regeneration,'' a riveting British film set in a mental hospital
designed to cure the psychological wounds of World War I veterans
and send them back into battle.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the director nor the star agrees with that lavish
patriotic expression which is nailed as an ``old lie'' in the film,
based on Pat Barker's prize-winning wartime trilogy. Her novel is a
fictionalized account of the real relationships experienced by Dr.
William Rivers, the head neurologist (Jonathan Pryce), Siegfried
Sassoon, a decorated war hero turned passionate anti-war polemicist
(James Wilby), and poet Wilfred Owen (Stuart Bunce), who switched
from romantic verse to blistering evocations of battlefield
horrors.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, Scottish director Gillies Mackinnon, who has
always been haunted by the murderous devastation of the first great
war, said he didn't think of his production as an ``anti-war''
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who see this don't need to be converted,'' he
commented at the Toronto International Film Festival last year. ``I
assume they already feel the First World War was a horrible,
horrible event and should be unrepeatable, but of course it isn't
unrepeatable. After all that carnage, there was the carnage of 1944
and now more carnage in Yugoslavia. It seems that human beings
haven't learned a lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   Pryce, interviewed last week by telephone from his vacation home
on Cape Cod, thought it was particularly appropriate that
``Regeneration'' is opening in the United States almost
simultaneously with ``Saving Private Ryan,'' which deals with the
Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the first 20 minutes of `Ryan' seriously demystifies
war. You can feel the trauma and agony the soldiers endured and the
lack of comprehension on their faces when they see the deaths
around them. After that, it turns into a very American movie with
the kind of wartime heroism shown in many American films.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither man, both 50, took a strictly pacifist position.
They agreed with Sassoon, who said he did not believe that no war
is ever justified. He was known as ``Mad Jack'' because he took so
many dangerous risks, but two years on the battlefield convinced
him that the war was ``being deliberately prolonged by those who
have the power to end it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sassoon wanted to be court-martialed for the publicity it would
bring to his declaration to end the war. Instead, pressured by
Sassoon's friend, writer Robert Graves, a medical board figured the
protest could be more effectively silenced by incarcerating him at
the Craiglockart War Hospital in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Mackinnon noted that Sassoon's eloquent statement is the
backbone of the story. The director of ``Playboys'' and ``Small
Faces'' couldn't quite account for his very early identification
with World War I veterans. His grandfather, a veteran, would never
talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That whole generation was paralyzed in some way. Wounded
inside,'' Mackinnon observed. ``This was a different kind of war.
You can understand the appalling reasons for World War II. This
wasn't like the Holocaust. There wasn't even a crazy philosophy
like Hitler's. This was like you didn't understand why millions of
men had to walk into machine guns. Everybody went there to be
destroyed. I had a sense of guilt that I should have been there _
or maybe,'' he added obliquely, ``I was there.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Glasgow, his home town, he used to meet World War I veterans
who had survived bloody battles fought in France's Somme valley.
One veteran told him, ``I was brought up a Catholic and all my life
I believed in God. Then I went to the Somme and I couldn't believe
in God anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   That remark made a lasting impression on Mackinnon. ``He was a
simple man and the one thing he had was a belief in God.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackinnon, who was educated at the Glasgow School of Art, added
softly, ``I believe in art, I suppose.''
</P>
<P>
   His art training stood him in good stead when it came to
incorporating poetry _ Sassoon's and Owen's _ in the film. ``We
introduced poems that were not in the book, but we needed them for
our story. (For instance: Owen's ``red lips are not so red as the
stained stones kissed by the English dead.'') As soon as you use
poetry in a film it becomes something different because poems are
not supposed to have visual images. As soon as you put visual
images with them it changes them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rivers, who empathizes with his patients and learns from
them, had his own misgivings about repairing them to fight again,
but he also felt that Sassoon's proclamation would accomplish
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wonderful to play a man who is learning about his
profession,'' Pryce said, ``while I'm going through the same
process learning to be Rivers. It was not a pro-active role but a
listening role. If you put it into another context, the Gulf War
soldiers were complaining about the same sort of neuroses as the
men in `Regeneration.' I think the film is very important because
it shows how to vocalize one's objections to war.''
</P>
<P>
   Pryce, who portrayed the pacifist Lytton Strachey in
``Carrington,'' said his closest exposure to a battleground was
observing the violence in Northern Ireland from his home in London.
``War is an obscenity and the necessity to fight is a tragedy. I've
asked myself if I would ever go and fight, but it's always been
hypothetical. There was a real possibility that I might be called
up at the time of the Falklands, but that seemed more like two
rival football teams rather than a war between England and
Argentina.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, he later went to Argentina to play Peron in
``Evita'' and got another view that, in a sense, corroborated his
own feelings. ``That war,'' Pryce said, referring to the 1982
conflict, ``was a political piece of maneuvering, not favored by
people in Britain although they rallied to support the soldiers.
The only ones who profited were the politicians of both countries.
In Buenos Aires, I learned that most Argentinians were happy they
lost because it enabled them to overthrow the generals ruling the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   When Pryce looks back at the Falklands era, he said, ``A great
part of me thinks I would not have gone to fight in that war.'' As
with ``Regeneration,'' ``My sympathies are very much with Sassoon
and Dr. Rivers, who sympathizes with the men.''

FIRST FAMILY'S BOOKS FOR HUNKERING DOWN  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ It is as predictable as the tourist traffic
and the county fair: the annual sending of the books, a healthy
competition between the only two bookstores on Martha's Vineyard,
which send a selection of summer reading for the first family.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, nothing is quite the same.
</P>
<P>
   This summer's books were chosen well in advance of any
presidential testimony to a grand jury, or any talk of tension
between Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton. But with so many reporters
searching for news, there is plenty of reading between the lines.
</P>
<P>
   So book sellers and authors are being asked such questions as
whether their books are about family dysfunction, or whether a
title like ``Fall From Grace'' was a way of sending a literary hint
to the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is too bad,'' said Boston-based novelist Elizabeth Berg.
``It felt to me as though the line of questioning may have been
manipulative,'' said Berg, refering to a TV interview in which she
was questioned about the significance of her book ``What We Keep''
arriving at the Clintons' summer doorstep, courtesy of the
Bickerton &AMP; Ripley bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   The novel is about intergenerational turmoil, healing, and
forgiviness, but it definitely was not written with the Clintons in
mind, Berg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The news is supposed to be about independent book sellers and
the service they perform,'' Berg said. ``It is of the highest
order.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners of both bookstores _ The Bunch of Grapes in Vineyard
Haven and Bickerton &AMP; Ripley Books in Edgartown _ say they chose
the books for content and quality, and not for any subtle messages.
But Berg was among the many people who have been victim of a press
corps whose annual vacation coverage has been acompanied by the
strange context of the controvesy surrounding Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly two weeks to spend here, White House aides say the
Clintons will probably take in the attractions of the island. Until
then, they can always enjoy their basket of books.
</P>
<P>
   Because Clinton last summer enjoyed ``Sacred'' by Dorchester's
Dennis Lehane, Bickerton &AMP; Ripley Books sent Lehane's newest work
of fiction, ``Gone, Baby, Gone.'' The only duplication on the two
stores' gift lists was a mystery by island author Philip Craig, ``A
Shoot on Martha's Vineyard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know they read, and we are so thankful that in all the
competitiveness that exists today we have a first family that
reads,'' said Bunch of Grapes manager Ann Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Bickerton &AMP; Ripley co-owner Marilyn R. Scheerbaum said Bill
Bryson's ``A Walk in the Woods'' was the one she selected as a
``family'' read.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a complete list of the books sent to the summer WHite
House:
</P>
<P>
   From Bunch of Grapes:
</P>
<P>
   ``Ships of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea'' by Gary Kinder; ``Havana
Dreams'' by Wendy Gimbel; ``The Last Apocalypse'' by James Reston
Jr.; ``Titan'' by Ron Chernow; ``Summer Sisters'' by Judy Bloom;
``The Book Shop'' by Penelope Fitzgerald; ``The Untouchables'' by
John Banville; ``A Shoot on Martha's Vineyard'' by Philip Craig.
</P>
<P>
   From Bickerton &AMP; Ripley:
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone, Baby, Gone'' by Dennis Lehane; ``Fall from Grace'' by
Clyde Phillips; ``What We Keep'' by Elizabeth Berg; ``A Walk in the
Woods'' by Bill Bryson; ``Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard'' by
Kiran Desai; ``A Shoot on Martha's Vineyard'' by Philip Craig.

 UNDATED: ... has been limited.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The summer-blooming butterfly bush has several near-blue
varieties, including Nanho Blue. It dies down to the ground each
winter in colder areas, but the plant doesn't die and instead
sprouts long gawky spikes of color in August that draw butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   The Bluebird variety of rose-of-Sharon has welcome near-blue
trumpets in profusion in late July, each with a red heart and
lasting only a day. This is a large, coarse, messy plant, as it has
all those spent blossoms to shed, but it can be cut back hard each
winter to keep it smaller than the 10 feet it aspires to.
</P>
<P>
   Caryopteris has everything going for it _ it's small, doesn't
need pruning, and produces bluish flowers in late summer and early
autumn. The new variety Worcester Gold even sports chartreuse
foliage that keeps its color all season and combines well with its
soft-blue flowers.
</P>
<P>
   There are many blue-flowered tropical vines, the best loved
being morning glory Heavenly Blue. These one-day trumpets are
truest blue and well named. They really do invite a feeling of
exultation, especially since you have waited so long for them to
bloom. The tissue-thin trumpets lack substance but are as
transparent to light as stained-glass windows. They are easy to
start from seed if planted in May where you want them to grow;
otherwise they are hard to transplant. The flowers won't appear
until September and don't stay open all day. Still, they're
infinitely easier to grow than the legendary blue Himalayan poppy,
which can't stand our hot summers. And no blue flower is more
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Another well worth trying is poisonous solanum. The Glasnevin
selection from Dublin has the most exquisite pale-blue flowers.
</P>
<P>
   There are many near-blue clematis. The bluest climber, according
to expert Sue Austin of the Completely Clematis Specialty Nursery
in Ipswich, is H.F. Young. Herbaceous clematis, which scramble on
the ground rather than climb, also come in some good blue tones,
especially Clematis x durandii. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Blue annuals
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most annuals are really just perennials from warmer climates
that aren't hardy here. They're a great source of blues, especially
if you have a conservatory for wintering them over. For the rest of
us, well, they're annuals.
</P>
<P>
   Evolvulus Blue Daze is a morning glory relative that's quicker
to bloom than its cousin. Grow it in hanging planters.
</P>
<P>
   Other worthy tropicals include the blue sky vine (Thunbergia
grandiflora); Clerodendrum ugadense, a shrub for potting; and
Iochroma cyaneum, a relative of the angel trumpet.
</P>
<P>
   Oxypetalum is the turqouise milkweed, hardly worth the trouble
some would say unless you have a greenhouse. The second year, it's
great.
</P>
<P>
   Tender salvias have better blues than perennial salvias. But
don't just stick with boring old Victoria. Try 4-foot-tall cobalt
S. guaranitica, or 3-foot-tall S. patens, which has huge flowers.
The Cambridge variety is light blue. S. thymoides is sky blue and a
foot tall. S. tiliifolia is electric blue. S. uliginosa has
sky-blue flowers that look great in a large terra-cotta pot. S.
sinaloensis is a knockout in containers because it has maroon
leaves to contrast with cobalt flowers. Destined for stardom!
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to search out most of these rarities at specialists
like Blue Meadow Farm.
</P>
<P>
   But garden centers also carry some good, common blue annuals.
You can ask them to order the bluest varieties for you. These
plants will sell themselves and the owners may thank you for the
tip.
</P>
<P>
   Ask for Blue Blazer, the bluest annual ageratum; Blue Boy
bachelor's buttons; and felicia _ the bluest annual daisy.
</P>
<P>
   Phacelia is a California wildflower that doesn't like our hot
summers, so it wins no awards for performance, but people love the
cobalt color, and it's suddenly widely available.
</P>
<P>
   Plumbago should be more available with its ice-blue, phloxlike
flowers. You can winter it over in a cool but sunny window.
</P>
<P>
   Cynoglossum amabile Firmament is close to sky blue, and
conveniently self-seeds. It's an overlooked garden workhorse that
blooms all summer without watering.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget petunias. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Blue flower sources
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are no nurseries that specialize in blue flowers. The best
places to find blue flowers are nurseries run by people who know
their stock and can describe it accurately. If you're very
particular about shades of blue, it's preferable to see a plant in
bloom before you buy it, as individuals perceive color differently.
</P>
<P>
   Plant catalogs, especially the cheaper sort, have a history of
notoriously misrepresenting purple-blue flowers as blue. There are
no roses, dahlias, or tulips that come close to being blue. They're
not even in the ballpark. So beware of any source that claims they
sell these. Photographs can also be misleading, as blue is
difficult to photograph accurately and many photographers use blue
filters on their cameras to enhance color.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's not misrepresentation to describe as ``blue'' a
flower that has red or purple undertones, such as campanula, but
that is widely regarded as blue.

   Blue is in the eye of the beholder. Actually, it's in the minute
rods and cones in our eyes that register light. The cones perceive
primary colors. The rods see black and white.
</P>
<P>
   During that 40 minutes or so between when the sun has set and
darkness occurs, all colors go through changes as we gradually lose
our ability to perceive any color at all. When darkness has fallen,
our night vision becomes black and white. After dark we can
perceive only white flowers.
</P>
<P>
   The first color we lose as the light fades is red. Then we lose
green. Blue is the last color wave frequency that our eyes
distinguish before the cones give up.
</P>
<P>
   But just before then, we can see the blue frequencies that are
present in most things but masked by other colors. For those few
minutes, most flowers, except the white ones, look blue. Almost
everything looks blue. It's the most romantic time of the day. In
English, it's sometimes called ``the magic hour.'' In French it's
called ``l'heure bleu.''
</P>
<P>
   The blue hour.

 Of cancer and drugs: Beware pot, cocaine
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smoking marijuana and cocaine may cause lung cancer the same way
that smoking cigarettes does.
</P>
<P>
   That is the conclusion of a first-of-its-kind study that
examined mucous samples from the bronchial passages of 104 healthy
volunteers, 28 of whom were nonsmokers while the rest smoked
cigarettes, marijuana, cocaine, or a mix of the three substances.
The samples were scoured for biological and chemical markers known
to signal an increased risk of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The results, published in the current Journal of the National
Cancer Institute, were dramatic: Smokers of any of the three
substances had substantially more markers of cancer than
nonsmokers, up to six times more. The evidence of precancerous
growths was most pronounced in subjects who smoked both marijuana
and tobacco, or cocaine and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Those findings from the UCLA School of Medicine are especially
troubling given recent trends of increased use of marijuana by US
youth, and continued use of crack cocaine. And ongoing campaigns to
discourage young people from smoking cigarettes ``may have the
unintended consequence that teenage smokers will replace tobacco
with marijuana,'' warned the authors of an editorial in the same
issue of the NCI journal.
</P>
<P>
   But the editorial writers, who work at the MD Anderson Cancer
Center in Houston, said they worry that finding definitive proof
that marijuana and cocaine cause cancer will be tougher than it was
for cigarettes. That, they explain, is ``because of the difficulty
in obtaining reliable information and follow-up from users of
illicit drugs.''

 &UR; A change of heart on cardiac rescues
</P>

</P>
<P>
   One of every four patients with severe cardiac troubles does not
want to be resuscitated if the patient's heart stops beating, a new
survey suggests.
</P>
<P>
   However, among patients who could be tracked down two months
after they left the hospital, 40 percent who had initially rejected
resuscitation had changed their minds. The reason, authors of the
study said, is that congestive heart failure patients who feel
terrible shortly after an attack often feel much better later on,
which distinguishes them from people suffering from terminal AIDS
or cancer, who often feel progressively worse.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, published in the American Heart Association journal
Circulation, also found that physicians are not especially good in
monitoring their heart patients' preferences. Researchers
interviewed the doctors of two-thirds of the 936 heart patients who
participated in the survey, and found that one in four doctors
incorrectly perceived their patient's preference regarding
resuscitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about just being in touch with your patient, listening to
them, and understanding where they're coming from,'' said Dr.
Harlan M. Krumholz, a cardiologist at Yale University School of
Medicine and lead author of the article. ``If they are severely
depressed, you may want to encourage them to hold off on deciding
against resuscitation. But if they're of sound mind, and
appropriately depressed after weighing their options, you have to
respect what they say.''

</P>
<P>
   The barking cough and hoarse voice that come with croup are all
too familiar to most parents of young children.
</P>
<P>
   But there's evidence that dexamethasone, an oral medication used
for extreme cases of the illness, can be equally effective with the
more common milder forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason why many of us did not provide dexamethasone for
croup was that many children with mild or moderate symptoms get
better without specific treatment, but it takes longer that way and
a larger proportion end up in the hospital,'' said Dr. David M.
Jaffe, director of emergency medicine at St. Louis Children's
Hospital and author of an editorial accompanying the croup study in
the current New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving dexamethasone can shorten the duration, making it
milder quicker, and reduce the proportion of children who end up
being hospitalized.''

A BIG DAY FOR THE BIG EAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not unusual for any given week to be crucial for a team's
hopes of success. But it is rare indeed when a week's round of
games is vital to a conference.
</P>
<P>
   That is the scenario looming for the Big East Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: Boston College at Georgia Tech; Ohio State at West
Virginia; Tennessee at Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   With two prime-time games plus a major intersectional battle for
Boston College, this is a showcase weekend for a conference that
has had very few such attractions.
</P>
<P>
   How important is the first week of the season? ``Huge,'' says
Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese, who has argued (successfully,
it appears) that his teams play some quality opponents in
nonconference games. ``Winning those games will put our teams right
into the national picture and give a tremendous boost to our
league.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Tranghese about scheduling in general and how the Big East
can get better and his answer is blunt: ``Go out and play some
people. It's that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple and difficult. West Virginia and Syracuse each has a
chance to beat a quality opponent. A West Virginia victory over an
Ohio State team ranked No. 1 in both preseason polls would
certainly boost the Mountaineers into the Top 10 and perhaps into
the Top 5.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse, which has what seems a suicidal schedule, plays
Tennessee and travels to Michigan the following week. A 2-0 start
would put the Orangemen in the Top 10.
</P>
<P>
   More important, it would put the Big East, a league desperate
for some positive developments, into the Top 10.
</P>
<P>
   The downside, of course, is that the Big East could be
eliminated from consideration as a competitive conference after one
week of play. Blowouts by Tennessee and Ohio State would further
tarnish a conference that can ill afford any more negative
perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Big East football is at a crossroads this season. The talk about
the Big Ten expanding has some people worried that Syracuse is on
that conference's wish list. It is, but only after Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Tranghese says he has never felt better about his conference.
And that is the way he should feel. In two weeks, the Big East at
least will have a chance to gain some respect as well as
respectability.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
ND will wait and see
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Word out of Notre Dame is that the Irish will wait at least
until the first of the year before making a decision on whether to
get serious in their dealings with the Big Ten or break them off.
Although the Big Ten was pushing for a quick decision on whether
Notre Dame would become the 12th member of the conference, that
doesn't appear to be the scenario. Notre Dame athletic director
Mike Wadsworth said last week that there is simply too much
information to absorb and discuss for the Irish to quickly decide
whether to even continue talking with the Big Ten ... Ohio State
officials are worried that All-America linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer
might not be eligible for the season after a shaky summer of
classes. Odds are that Katzenmoyer, who has openly expressed
disdain for the academic side of collegiate life, will make it
through, but don't count on him remaining in Columbus much past the
Buckeyes' last game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
BC unfairly hounded
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Word has it that some BC fans are unhappy with the Eagles'
decision to drop Southern Methodist in favor of Northeastern. Give
me a break. First of all, it's a better opportunity for the Eagles
to get a win _ one that will count toward the required minimum of
six for bowl eligibility. Secondly, just how big a rivalry does
anyone think SMU-BC is? Northeastern is a better draw in this area,
and it's a better game for college football in New England ...
What's going on at Virginia? It's only August and coach George
Welsh has made his team off limits to the media all week ... Being
No. 1 creates added pressure for an Ohio State program that seems
to be surrounded by it. But according to coach John Cooper, it's no
big deal. ``There's pressure, sure,'' Cooper told the Ohio State
media last week in Columbus. ``But not any more than there's been
the past few years. We were a good team last year, and the nucleus
of that team is back.'' ... Going into the season, Nebraska has the
longest winning streak in Division 1-A with 14. Michigan (12), UCLA
(10), and Colorado State (9) are next ... The Western Athletic
Conference has an unusual situation. Every team in the league has
at least 10 starters back. Nevada-Las Vegas has 20 ... Iowa State
has changed its recruiting tactics. The Cyclones have 18 former
junior college players on their roster.

OUTSIZE SUBURBAN IDEAL OFFERS PRIVACY OVER NEIGHBORLINESS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NATHAN COBB  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEEDHAM, Mass. _ Perfect.
</P>
<P>
   That was the word that came to Christine Battat's mind when she
laid eyes on Burr Drive nearly 18 months ago during a house-hunting
tour. After all, the 5,300-square-foot, nearly completed colonial
she was considering had the kind of turnkey comfort she and
husband, Randy, wanted for themselves and their two children when
they moved from Chicago. And just look at Burr Drive itself: a
slightly bowed cul-de-sac carved in the early 1990s from a small
forest of northeastern pine, a safe haven of eight large and
meticulous homes that display well-tended lawns by day and subdued
lighting by night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' Christine Battat remembers thinking, ``is it.
</P>
<P>
   Motor through Boston's suburbs and you'll see that such
subdivisions are also it for many other familes who can pay the
price. As land suitable for development dwindles, particularly in
the inner suburban ring, old estates and former farms are
transformed into short, dead-end ``lollipops.'' But the new houses
that line many of these instant neighborhoods are hardly the
shoeboxes upon which suburbia was founded after World War II, nor
even the relatively modest manses of a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all that is different. Wednesday's sprawling suburbs
offered accessibility and togetherness, a vision of block parties,
barbecues, and over-the-back-fence intimacy that knit the
neighborhood together. Today's cul-de-sac is almost
antineighborhood by contrast, existing unto itself while providing
cocooned residents with the security, privacy, and exclusivity of a
gated community. Except without the gates.
</P>
<P>
   This quiet new street, where house lots have sold for as much as
$305,000, is typical of a new upsized American Dream being found in
suburbs from Boxford to Natick to Sharon.
</P>
<P>
   But if square footage has lured these baby boomers to Burr
Drive, so has the notion of cul-de-sac living. Schmooze with the
families who live here and soon they'll be extolling the virtues of
privacy and security. They like the fact that while Sunday drivers
may turn into the short street to ogle the homes, the only
nonresident pedestrians are the occasional joggers who bound onto
the road from busy South Street. ``This is a very closed
environment,'' Thomas says, adding that the nearest parallel
street, a cul-de-sac 200 yards away, is ``another community,
really.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Burr Drive is a kind of island, a place from which kids
_ five of the families have children age 12 and under _ are ferried
by car to their activities. Meanwhile, non-islanders are permitted
but their presence is noted. ``We watch each other's houses,''
points out Karon Cohen, who moved onto the street three years ago
with her husband, Lewis. ``We watch each other's comings and
goings. We're very protective of the street, and we're very aware
of `foreign' cars when they come down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Their concern about traffic is such that residents recently rose
up at a public hearing to express their opposition to a plan that
would link Burr Drive to a proposed subdivision. ``We bought on a
cul-de-sac for a reason,'' Battat explains. ``We don't want traffic
going through here.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't necessarily the kind of place where these folks grew
up. Paula Vanderhorst and John Thomas are 39-year-old management
consultants who moved here three years ago with their three kids
and a live-in nanny. Vanderhorst was raised in a small town in New
York State, cavorting in a neighborhood where kids roamed from
street to street after school. There were green fields to play in
too. Now her children spend much of their playtime right here on
Burr Drive with their closest neighbors, where they are well
watched and well contained. That's the way Vanderhorst likes it.
``I wouldn't let my children disappear for half an hour,'' she
declares. ``With all the weird stuff going on today, you just can't
be too careful.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like a movie set
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drive down Burr Drive on a non-summer weekday morning and it
looks like a movie set during lunchbreak. The silence is broken
only by the occasional high chirping of birds or the low hum of
mowers being pointed to and fro by lawn-care workers. The action
picks up when the kids hit the 40-foot-wide pavement to bike or
play street hockey, but the mood is hardly raucous. ``One of the
reasons we moved here is that we wouldn't be bombarded with
children,'' says Karon Cohen, who has two grown children and one
grown stepchild. The street definitely has a subdued feeling,
though its serenity is not for everyone. John Bruno, whose Walpole
construction company built the Battats' house on speculation, says
he lost more than one prospective buyer for the home because
several people wanted to live in a larger neighbrhood with more
kids around.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the adults' social life is, as Vanderhorst puts it,
``still evolving.'' But it's aided in no small measure by the fact
that Burr Drive is almost exclusively populated by educated
professionals who range in age from their late 30s to early 50s.
It's a group that comfortably shares personal values and swaps
business war stories when gathering at Christmas or Thanksgiving,
or at, say, Lew Cohen's 50th birthday party. They jokingly critique
one another's lawns and gladly fetch coffee for each other at
Starbucks, miles away. Yet they do all this with the same sense of
privacy and retreat that brought them here in the first place.
``Everyone knows everyone, but they don't know everyone's
business,'' is the way Karon Cohen puts it.
</P>
<P>
   All of them are the very first owners of their respected homes.
That means are there no ancient and honorable cliques on their
little road, no old guard eager to declare that things have been
done a certain way for years. And the street _ which doesn't even
appear on many recent maps _ is so new none of its initial
residents has yet moved away. ``I think if you had second- and
third-generation owners, people wouldn't socialize as much,'' Lew
Cohen declares. ``Older neighborhoods tend to be more stratified.''

PATRIOTS' JOHNSON SET TO CASH IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Patriots and linebacker Ted Johnson have
reached agreement on a five-year contract extension worth in the
vicinity of $25 million, which should be made official sometime
today.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and his agent, Jack Mills of Colorado, have been
negotiating for several weeks. The talks stalled for a while
because Johnson was seeking Levon Kirkland-type money _ five years,
$28 million. But Mills backed off and the parties came to an
agreement Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have said privately that they would not have been
able to put together such a deal for Johnson if they had matched
the six-year, $36 million package the Jets gave Curtis Martin when
he left New England as a restricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a fourth-year veteran, could have become an
unrestricted free agent after the season, but the Patriots probably
would have designated him their franchise player, thus retaining
him, anyway. But the team didn't want to create bad feelings and
decided to do a deal immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's $403,000 salary for 1998 probably will be upgraded,
and he'll also receive a sizable signing bonus, though perhaps not
as big as Willie McGinest's $8 million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-foot-3-inch, 240-pounder from the University of Colorado,
Johnson immediately began to establish himself as an NFL presence
after the Patriots selected him in the second round, 57th overall,
in the 1995 draft. In his debut season, Johnson started the 12
games in which he appeared and earned a berth on the NFL All-Rookie
Team.
</P>
<P>
   He emerged as the club's leading tackler with 115 _ 87 solo _
during the Super Bowl season of 1996 and was selected first-team
All-Pro by USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   Last season Johnson set career highs with 127 tackles (95 solo),
again leading the team, and four sacks. He was picked as a Pro Bowl
alternate.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's considered on the cusp of becoming a Pro Bowl
perennial, and retaining him was regarded as a top Patriots
priority.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiating parameters were roughly set when Kirkland signed
his blockbuster deal during the spring, virtually guaranteeing
Johnson an astronomical raise as he approached the end of his
present three-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations intensified when the Patriots opened the exhibition
season in San Francisco Aug. 2 as Mills and club vice president
Andy Wasynczuk spent most of the game discussing the pact. Both
sides termed the talks encouraging and proceeded from there.

<P>
   But if folks on Burr Drive are bound together by their
similarities, so are they kept apart by their work styles. When
Randy Battat eases his Cadillac out of the garage at 5:30 a.m.,
bound for a swim before he takes on his job as a vice president of
Motorla, he may have been beaten off the mark by as much as two
hours by Lew Cohen in his Mercedes. ``You can't leave for work at
7:30 or 8 o'clock and expect to pay for these houses,'' says Cohen,
who owns a company that manufactures adhesive tape.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of couples here have two incomes, and most don't
work fixed hours. In the sunlit kitchen of John Thomas's house,
where he earns a star on the family calendar when he arrives home
from work by 7 p.m., he smiles wryly as he wife reviews his recent
success. ``One, two, three, four, five,'' Vanderhorst announces as
she counts the stars. ``That's five in May. And in April, he had
two.'' Thomas shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   Toss in the likes of jogging, squash, and tennis, not to mention
what Vanderhorst calls those ``yuppie workout areas,'' and it's not
surprising these people aren't buying fixer-upper homes and
spending their Saturdays atop ladders. ``The most precious
commodity for people like this is time,'' says Bill Kiley,
president of Hunneman Coldwell Banker, who points to a recent study
that found that 87.8 percent of all married buyers of homes in
Massachusetts are two-income families. ``Married couples used to
tend to buy older houses, fix them up, and then move on. That went
away with the dual-income buyer. No one's around the house to deal
with contractors anymore. So they choose new construction.'' &QL;

   The average Burr Drive home _ most sit on an acre of land _ is a
2 1/2-story, columned colonial valued for tax purposes by the town
of Needham at $665,450 and consisting of 4,815 square feet of
finished living space, a 2,341-square-foot basement, 10 rooms, 4
1/2 bedrooms, three bathrooms, one lavatory, central air
conditioning, a deck, and a Jacuzzi. Three-car garages are
required, as spelled out by the design standards of the developer.
Artificial siding is banned, and so are TV satellite dishes.
Clotheslines must be out of sight, sheds are limited in size, and
only cedar fences are permitted. There's one swimming pool on the
street, four sport-utility vehicles, two dogs, one cat, and the
occasional white-tailed deer.
</P>
<P>
   Francis and Cathy Fung, who with their two children became the
second family to set up housekeeping on Burr Drive, moved here from
a more modest Needham neighborhood in 1994. Their previous house
was half the size of the stately 4,000-square-foot colonial that
Francis Fung, an engineer, designed himself. The Fungs initially
worried a bit about who their new neighbors might be, but today
they're happy living among the other baby boomers who've chosen to
reside on Burr Drive. Yet they know that their previous
neighborhood is separated from their current one by more than a few
miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw more of our neighbors in the old neighborhood,''
Francis Fung explains as he relaxes in his oversize living room.
``The houses were closer together, and you'd see them when you went
out. Here, the people travel a lot on business. And they seem to
spend a lot of time inside their houses. They're not outside mowing
their lawns, so they don't see each other and say, `Hey, come on
over for a beer.'
</P>
<P>
   ``These people have very busy schedules. So when they do get
together, there's a lot of talk about e-mail and airports.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Old family estate
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like most similar new neighborhoods, Burr Drive sprouted on a
patch of land that once belonged to a single family. The wooded
property was owned for much of this century by Leslie Cutler, the
first female senator in Massachusetts. In 1973, it was purchased,
in two parcels totaling about 40 acres, by Dr. Fredrick Cunliffe
and his wife, Donna, along with another family member, A.G.
Hartman. The total price of $227,500, which included Leslie
Cutler's large and still-standing stone house built in 1913, was
less than the cost of a typical 1-acre Burr Drive lot of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   The Cunliffes now spend much of their time in Maine and Florida,
so Donna Cunliffe and Hartman began drawing up plans for Burr Drive
in 1990. They retained one of the eight house lots for themselves,
building a massive, 7,500-square-foot home where Hartman now lives.
Four additional large new houses are planned for the remaining
acreage beyond the end of the street, homes that are expected to
fetch well over $1 million apiece and will overlook the nearby
Charles River. This means that the development will finally be able
to live up to its seldom-used name: Waterview Estates. ``This is
not an Ozzie and Harriet neighborhood,'' muses Hartman, who is in
his 70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some beautiful old trees here,'' Donna Cunliffe
says of the woods that Burr Dive has replaced. ``But someone was
eventually going to do it (develop the land) if we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they are doing it only a half-mile east of Burr Drive,
as the estate once owned by Thomas Dudley Cabot becomes 20-acre
Stonefield Estates, a lollipop of 16 new homes being marketed for
$1.2 to $1.3 million each. Three houses are already in place, and
the residents have held a cookout. Their other neighbors will move
in during the months ahead, seeking out the tranquility and privacy
found in other such grand cul-de-sacs of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is it,'' they will likely say. ``Perfect.''

A PRESIDENCY OF LIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like his marriage, Bill Clinton's career is built on lies. For
as long as he has been a political figure, he has trafficked in
falsehood. He has lied about things that really mattered and about
things that really didn't. There was the lie about not raising
taxes. The lie about not having inhaled. The lie about China's most
favored nation status. The lie _ the lies _ about Gennifer Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   He lied about filling out his term as governor, he lied about
partial-birth abortion, he lied about being drafted, he lied about
nonexistent church burnings in Arkansas. Those missiles that
weren't pointed at America's children were a lie, and so were the
White House Travel Office staffers he fired to ``save money.'' He
was the only president to come to office knowing something about
agriculture, he said. ``The Lincoln Bedroom was never `sold''' for
political contributions, he said. Raw FBI files on hundreds of
Republicans ended up in the White House because of ``an honest
bureaucratic snafu,'' he said. All lies.
</P>
<P>
   As some insects instinctively avoid the light, Bill Clinton
instinctively avoids the truth. Not because he can't control
himself _ anyone who can propel himself from Hope, Ark., to the
White House possesses self-control in spades _ but because he has
learned that lying pays. He has learned that he will be rewarded
for telling the right lies at the right time, and that while many
will recognize his dishonesty, few will hold him accountable for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Americans know this president is false. On the day he was
reelected in 1996, exit pollsters reported that 60 percent of those
voting did not consider Clinton ``honest and trustworthy.'' They
reelected him anyway. Which is why he treats them with the same
contempt he treats his marriage. In a democracy, the people are
entitled to knowingly return a liar to the highest office in the
land. They are not entitled then to demand his respect.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to Monday's grand jury testimony and late
night speech, it was predicted that the president was finally going
to come clean about his squalid affair with Monica Lewinsky _ that
he would apologize for having lied so insistently and having gone
to such lengths to cover it up. But to do that, Clinton would have
had to change the habits of a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   So of course he didn't come clean on Monday. He refused to
answer some questions during the grand jury session, he answered
others with vague nonresponses, and he took long breaks to consult
with his lawyers. That is not the behavior of a witness ``anxious''
to testify ``completely and truthfully,'' as Clinton described
himself on July 31. It is the behavior of a deceiver struggling to
keep up his deceit.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't apologized. The words ``I'm sorry'' were not in his
speech on Monday, nor the words ``forgive me,'' nor the words ``I'm
ashamed.'' His brief admission of wrongdoing came across as little
more than a prelude to attacking Kenneth Starr and insisting that
``even presidents have private lives.''
</P>
<P>
   And even in the course of belatedly, begrudgingly confessing his
seven months of lies, he lied some more. ``My answers,'' he said of
his January deposition, ``were legally accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the deposition in which he was asked, ``At any time
were you and Monica alone together in the Oval Office?'' and he
answered, ``I don't recall.'' It was the deposition in which he was
asked, ``Did you have an extramarital sexual affair with Monica
Lewinsky?'' and he answered, ``No.'' Those answers weren't legally
accurate. They were legally perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The toadies, the kneejerks, and the Clinton-right-or-wrongers
instruct us to drop the subject now that the president has spoken.
For them, nothing has changed. Starr is still the villain.
Clinton's troubles are still the work of a vast right-wing
conspiracy. And it is still an outrage that the president is being
hounded about what is, after all, just sex.
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't just sex.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton lives in the White House, the most awe-inspiring
mansion in America. He flies on Air Force One. He is guarded by the
Secret Service. The Marine Band plays ``Hail to the Chief'' when he
approaches. For six years, he has been addressed as ``Mr.
President.'' Audiences stand when he enters the room. Radio and TV
networks turn over the microphone when he wants to speak. And when
he wants to go on vacation, Martha's Vineyard millionaires turn
over their homes.
</P>
<P>
   He is lavished with honors, deferred to, fawned over. Not
because he is a man who deserves honor and deference, but because
he is the president. He has the job he sought all his life, and all
the glory and privileges that go with it.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents, even mediocre ones, are indulged and flattered. They
are forgiven much. But at the end of the day, they are expected to
behave like presidents. They are expected not to befoul their
office, not to act dishonorably, not to be jerks or buffoons or
lechers. Not even in private. Not even in their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   Our long national nightmare is of Clinton's making. He abused
his position shamefully, then jabbed his finger at us and denied
everything. Now he has the gall to say, ``Even presidents have
private lives.''
</P>
<P>
   If he really believed that that was a defense, he would be a
fool. But this president is no fool. He is a liar.
</P>
<P>
   And a disgrace.

 DOES M's BRASS HAVE WILL, SKILL TO FIX THINGS?  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Lou Piniella's shoes were covered in dust, which might
have been a good metaphor for a Mariner season covered in the
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But it was dust from something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was over at the new ballpark today,'' Piniella said
Wednesday, removing one of his shoes and wiping down the black
leather with care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, it's nice. The people of Seattle have something they can
be really proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not something the Mariners' skipper could exactly say
about his team's results in the standings or in the court of public
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   By now, all citizens of Marinerville understand that the
remainder of '98 will mean not much more than Alex Rodriguez's run
at 40-40; Ken Griffey Jr.'s usual amassing of hits, RBIs,
over-the-back catches and homers; and the development of the
youngsters soon to be called up from Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   And this is really strange.
</P>
<P>
   Here it is mid-August and the home team is dead. One trip down
to the Kingdome these days is all it takes to understand the depths
of this lost season.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Gate D, there used to hang a giant poster that featured
every one of the Mariner stars and starters. Jay Buhner. Edgar
Martinez. Ken Griffey. Alex Rodriguez. Jeff Fassero. David Segui.
Russ Davis. Randy Johnson. Joey Cora.
</P>
<P>
   Well, wouldn't you know it. Someone has gone and taken it down.
It's like the end of an era. The little star-studded Northwest team
that helped bring baseball back to life is gone.
</P>
<P>
   All that's left out there on the Kingdome exterior are big block
letters that say ``Gate D.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly the sort of alluring displaythat would attract
walk-up ticket buyers into the Kingdome, where expectations for
meaningful Augusts and Septembers were born in 1995, '96 (where the
M's were still in the AL West hunt until the final weekend) and
'97.
</P>
<P>
   But it makes sense that the poster has been removed.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is gone, finally, about eight months too late,
considering the best deal and the best way to have rid the team of
this problem would have been to trade Johnson last January.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Cora and Davis are either out of Seattle or on the trading
block, which means the M's must now search for a lead-off hitter,
second baseman, third baseman, and, yes, a No. 1 starter and a
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Cora gives you some clue, though, about the downtrodden
emotional status of the Mariner team, which has been left frayed
and deflated by months of indecision and lack of trades to try and
improvement the team _ all culminating in the botched Johnson
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Fallout continued even after the trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a meeting after Randy was traded and they didn't even
ask some of us to come,'' Cora said Wednesday, still extremely
disappointed and hurt by the way things unraveled this season.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, only the core group of Mariners (Rodriguez, Segui,
Buhner, Dan Wilson, Fassero, Moyer and Griffey) was involved in the
post-trade meeting in which Mariner vice president of baseball
operations Woody Woodward tried to diffuse anger over the Johnson
trade _ which brought no major leaguers from the Astros and had
players seriously thinking the M's were about to dismantle this
one-time contending team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm out of here, but that really hurt,'' Cora said. ``I
mean, I'm still out there busting my butt every day. But it's so
obvious I'm out of the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   There is still no clear indication that the chain of command
from ownership down to the front office will soon be put into
working order.
</P>
<P>
   For the Mariners to make any real improvements, something must
be done. One might guess that ownership is considering the notion
that someone, or some people, might have to pay for what went wrong
with the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   But ownership has some responsibility, too. It needs to make
known its priorities.
</P>
<P>
   No one will ever know what might have happened if ownership had
let Woodward and Chuck Armstrong offer Johnson the Roger
Clemens-type money ($8 million a year) they thought was
appropriate, even if Johnson's agents were demanding Greg Maddux
money ($11 million) or a trade.
</P>
<P>
   And after that did not happen, no one knows how much brighter
and happier 1998 would have been if Woodward had gone ahead and
pulled the trigger on an off-season Johnson deal. The Yankees,
Indians and Blue Jays all were ready to make a good deal, although
Woodward obviously thought he wasn't getting enough for Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   And no one is exactly explaining why ownership has decided to
meddle in the affairs of their baseball people _ unless, of course,
there is division or mistrust between ownership and the baseball
people.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Cora said, maybe none of the faceless 16 owners care.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got their ballpark,'' Cora said.
</P>
<P>
   But we can tell you this: It's August in Seattle and the home
team is out of contention. What happens between now and spring
training will tell the good citizens of Marinerville everything
they need to know about whether they should be proud or peeved.

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ACTON, Mass. _ Tatiana Benharbone strains forward in the
driver's seat of her taxi, gesturing with one hand flying off the
wheel, sometimes two. The Volkswagen van glides down Route 2,
slipping into Boston at dusk.
</P>
<P>
   It is an hour when, in the glare of headlights and under the
dark canopy of sky, fairy tales seem possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think I'm not really from this planet,'' says
Benharbone. ``That's what saves me.''
</P>
<P>
   Benharbone's home planet would be a world where gypsy dancers
spin to the beat of Spanish guitars, where horses leap through
fields of pastel fog. A land where a person can live many lives.
</P>
<P>
   Benharbone has wandered from life to life, continent to
continent. She has crossed European borders hidden in a covered
wagon, peered from windows of Jerusalem buses, always searching,
reaching out for some elusive comfort.
</P>
<P>
   A Jew born in Poland in 1937, Benharbone was raised Catholic by
a family who, by taking her in, spared her from the Treblinka death
camp where her parents and grandmother died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like I was from anyplace,'' says Benharbone. ``I
didn't know who I was or where I was going. I felt like a displaced
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving a cab has become the latest vehicle for Benharbone's
wanderlust. Today, she speeds down Boston-area highways, acting out
her rootlessness. Her unsettled nature, common to many Holocaust
survivors, is a product of the World War II era when she and
millions of other Jews were forced to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
   A half-century later, 891 Holocaust survivors live in
Massachusetts, according to the registry of the Holocaust Museum in
Washington. Most are elderly. Benharbone is one of the few who
remain in the working world.
</P>
<P>
   Benharbone's postwar journey began on the doorstep of an
orphanage, where she was left clutching a rosary and New Testament,
with no idea what it meant to be Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   The little Polish girl grew into a flamenco dancer who twirled
her way through New York, California, Spain, and Israel, commanding
attention on stage with the thump-thump of her high heels, with her
dark beauty and wild hair.
</P>
<P>
   That gypsy dancer became an artist whose political cartoons and
whimsical animal dreamscapes were snatched up on the streets of
Toulouse, France.
</P>
<P>
   After she had saturated the Toulouse art market, Benharbone
landed back in America, because the $200 plane fare to New York was
the same price as a bus ticket to Nice. Now the
orphan-turned-dancer-turned-painter is the owner of ABC Taxi, a
one-woman cab company she has run out of her Acton home since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Once widowed, once divorced, living far from two adult children,
Benharbone is still searching, still running. She continues to play
hide and seek with the loneliness that has shadowed her from
childhood. At age 60, she is more comfortable in motion than at
rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I wake up in the morning and everything hurts,'' she
says. ``But as soon as I get going on a cab job, I'll start talking
to the customer and, it's neat, I feel a lot better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in my house, sometimes it feels really strange, kind of
lonesome and empty. Acton isn't home. I don't think anyplace is
home.''
</P>
<P>
   She left her first home as a toddler. Her parents had already
disappeared into the chaos of wartorn Warsaw, ultimately bound for
the death camps. Her grandmother woke her one night, she remembers,
and took her to a family in Krakow.
</P>
<P>
   That night exists as a series of snapshots in her mind _ a
bundle of blankets, a team of horses, staring despairingly into a
bowl of noodle soup in her strange new home.
</P>
<P>
   Her grandmother promised to come back. She never did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting with my grandmother, every time I formed an
attachment with someone, they disappeared,'' Benharbone told
historians from the Holocaust Museum.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, she was given up by the family that hid her, and
wound up in the care of Lena Kuchler, a Polish Jew who, like
Benharbone, passed as Catholic to survive the war. Kuchler gathered
Jewish orphans under her wing, later recording her story in a book,
``My Hundred Children.''
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that postwar violence against Jews in Poland threatened
the children's lives, Kuchler snuck her brood into France and
eventually took the group to Israel. Benharbone, one of the
youngest, was adopted from France by an American family, perhaps
because she was ``too frail and dreamy for life on a kibbutz,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Benharbone does not like to talk directly about the
Holocaust, which she calls a tired subject. She does acknowledge,
however, that a disrupted childhood has shaped her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this terrible hole inside you,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Benharbone's days of running did not end when she came to the
United States. Too raw and troubled for her adopted family, she
says, she moved in and out of their Cambridge home and, after
graduating from Simmons College in Boston, ran off to dance in New
York in 1961. There she met her first husband, flamenco dancer and
choreographer Roberto Iglesias.
</P>
<P>
   The two dancers performed together throughout Europe and Israel.
After Iglesias died of a heart attack in 1972, Benharbone started
her own dance company in Israel. The Jerusalem Post wrote of ``the
astonishing Spanish dancer Tatiana ... whose flying heels, toes,
knees and other appendages have to be seen to be believed.''
</P>
<P>
   Flamenco spoke to Benharbone, who identified more as a gypsy
than as a Jew. ``The soul of flamenco deals with pain, it comes
from an oppressed people,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Benharbone remarried and settled in France with her two children
from her first marriage. An overzealous doctor, whom she now
curses, told her a bad hip made dancing too risky. She turned to
painting to express her restlessness, her love of movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always try to create things that are beautiful, that don't
really exist,'' she explained in the interview with Holocaust
Museum historians. ``I never wanted to deal with the anger and the
pain. Inside me there's this tremendous rage. Sometimes I feel it
and it scares me.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the Boston area was a disappointment to Benharbone,
and it strained her marriage to the breaking point. With no way to
make a living as an artist, she founded ABC Taxi. With the
exception of a short break to dance in California, the taxi has
been her life work ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started with ABC I was lonely and divorced, and
it was great for me,'' she says. ``The phone would ring and I would
get to go on a ride somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Benharbone has struggled with boredom, and with the back and
neck pain that come from driving all day. But she tries to find
purpose in her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business has kept me alive and paid my bills,'' she says.
``It also helps people by getting them where they need to go. It's
not painting, it's not dancing or poetry or creating beauty, but it
does a practical good.''
</P>
<P>
   And it keeps her moving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on a spiritual search now,'' says Benharbone. ``I write
songs, I write poetry. Words just come to me and I record them when
I'm walking my dog in the woods or driving the cab early in the
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, she adds, ``I have a dream to get myself in an RV and
just go, just drive out to the Grand Canyon.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the journey to Logan and back suffices. She
jokes with her customers, but she rarely tells them personal
stories, saying, ``My own life is not that interesting.'' She takes
her dog, Kitty, along on most trips, and gives her cars names like
``the flying phroomph.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you always look forward to new adventures, new exciting
things, new learning experience,'' she says, ``then it's OK. You
can get through.''

IN PURSUIT OF GARDENING'S BLUE HEAVEN 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blue is the color most pursued by gardeners.
</P>
<P>
   Yet blue is a mysterious hue with as many personalities as uses.
Blue flowers can be tranquil or melancholy, dark as denim or light
as the sky, restful as twilight or restless as the sea. They blur
boundaries, suggest distant horizons, and make gardens look larger.
</P>
<P>
   But above all, blue flowers are sought after.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue is always the most popular color because it goes with
everything,'' theorizes Kathy Tracey, an owner of Avant Gardens in
North Dartmouth, Mass.. ``And because it seems hard to find.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian McGowan of Blue Meadow Farm in Montague, Mass. says blue
is the most requested flower color at his nursery. He is puzzled by
this. ``Is it psychological? It's amazing. Almost everybody loves
blue. It must be human nature. Blue, that's the thing people die
for. I don't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   Let us, then, try to deconstruct the mystery of blue in the
garden. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Blue words
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Everyone loves blue, but not everyone can agree on which blue
they love or what to call it.
</P>
<P>
   It can give linguists the blues.
</P>
<P>
   Many languages don't even have a special word for blue, lumping
it in with the word for green. The Japanese language only
relatively recently developed a distinctive word for blue. In
ancient Chinese poetry, the same character was used to describe the
color of grass and sky. In Homer's ``Odyssey,'' the blue Aegean Sea
is referred to as green.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``The Primary Colours,'' Alexander Theroux says that
names for colors always enter languages in the same order,
beginning with black and white, then red, then green and yellow.
Blue comes next, but until it gets its own word, it's considered a
green.
</P>
<P>
   Today English has many words to describe shades of blue, but
confusion persists. By true blue, do we mean saturated cornflower
or gentian blue, or pastel sky blue, or the grayer forget-me-not
blue, the steel blue of amsonia, or the darker ink and sapphire
blues?
</P>
<P>
   And to make it really confusing, most so-called blue garden
flowers have purple in them, from just a hint in chicory to quite a
bit in catnip. This lack of a clear divide to the naked eye between
blue and purple drives gardeners and nurserymen crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's always looking for true blue, whatever that is,''
said McGowan, owner of the appropriately named Blue Meadow Farm,
which sells unusual annuals and perennials. ``They grill you up and
down to make sure it's really blue. They'll complain if something
has too much purple. People do get really picky about colors. And
often just blue isn't good enough. They want sky blue, cobalt blue,
clear blue. They try to come up with names for what they want.
There's lots of blue flowers, but finding a particular person's
blue, the blue they want, is hard.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Blue roses
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The blue rose has been the Holy Grail of plant breeding for
generations. After all, according to market researchers, blue is
the world's favorite color and roses are its favorite flower, so a
blue rose should take flower lovers by storm.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is that it doesn't exist, even after rose
companies poured millions of dollars into hybridizing efforts
before giving up in disgust in the 1960s. The closest they could
come to true blue was sickly mauve.
</P>
<P>
   You see, the rose family has no members with blue pigment to use
as a starting point for breeding. And the gene for blue is like
charisma. Either you've got it or you don't.
</P>
<P>
   The petunia and delphinium families are loaded with it, for
instance, while the tulip, dahlia, and rose families aren't. And
there's nothing hybridizers can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   End of story? Not these days. Biogeneticists have gotten into
the act. We'll just borrow the blue gene from a petunia, they said
10 years ago, and we'll have blue roses by 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, they missed their deadline.
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong? Florigene of Australia did actually succeed in
isolating the blue gene in petunias along with the gene that
switches it on. And they did tranfer this into roses. It was quite
a scientific achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Except that the roses with the blue gene still don't look blue.
</P>
<P>
   The problem now is that the pH, or acidity, in the rose organs
that carry petal color are all wrong, so the blue is in there but
we can't see it. And you can't change the pH without making the
whole plant sick.
</P>
<P>
   Florigene has spent millions of dollars over a decade to reach
this roadblock, and prospects for getting past it are not great.
</P>
<P>
   But they have had some success splicing blue genes into
chrysanthemums and carnations. Blue-engineered carnations are
currently on the market in Japan and will eventually turn up here.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Zary, vice president for research at rose giant Jackson &AMP;
Perkins, has seen the new blue carnation. ``It looks
lavender-blue,'' he reports. ``It's not very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the whole enterprise illustrates why true-blue
flowers are so rare. We can clone mice and sheep but blue flowers
are still holding onto their secrets.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Blue color theory
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blue is one of the cool colors of the spectrum. The others are
green and violet. Blue appears warmer as it approaches the green
and yellow range of the spectrum and cooler as it nears violet and
red. It's helpful to think of warm blues (turquoise) and cool blues
(violet).
</P>
<P>
   All other colors can similarly be divided between warm and cool.
There are warm pinks that move toward yellow (peach) and cool pinks
that move toward violet (mauve). And it can look awful if you plant
flowers in warm hues next to flowers in cool hues of the same color
family, like combining cool pink phlox with warm pink carnations.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a big problem with blues, however, since almost all
of them are on the violet-red (cool) side of the divide. Very few
blue flowers come in warm shades. The turquoise subtropical
milkweed oxypetalum is one, and it is difficult to combine
harmoniously with other flowers.
</P>
<P>
   But the vast majority of blues combine easily with mauves,
violets, and all the many purple-blue flowers, creating a large
group of flowers to use for the cool garden. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Blue gardens
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blue flowers look good with all other flowers. Except blue
flowers. Experts agree that blue flowers alone together in a
monochromatic garden are a downer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have yet to see a successful all-blue border,'' says Pamela
Harper, who has professionally photographed hundreds of gardens.
``Blue flowers bring out the best in other colors, but they don't
bring out the best in each other. Blue never looks bad. But it
isn't strong enough to have sufficient impact on it's own. It's a
better backup color. And if some of the blues are just a tiny bit
off, they don't meld.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet blue, like white, can be a ``snob color'' and there was a
bit of a vogue in all-blue gardens among the super-rich during the
Belle Epoque.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted Edwardian British garden designer Gertrude Jekyll
to scold: ``It is a curious thing that people will sometimes spoil
some garden project for the sake of a word. For instance a blue
garden, for beauty's sake, may be hungering for a group of white
lilies, or something of palest lemon-yellow, but is not allowed to
have it because it is called the blue garden, and there must be no
other flowers. ... Any experienced colorist knows that the blues
will be more telling _ more purely blue _ by the juxtaposition of
rightly placed complementary color.''
</P>
<P>
   Yellow and blue was artist Claude Monet's favorite color
combination and garden designer Jekyll, an artist too, also favored
touches of yellow to make blues look bluer. The entryway to one
predominantly blue garden she designed was dominated by gold
foliage.
</P>
<P>
   Though most experts advise against attempting an all-blue
garden, gifted Irish colorist Helen Dillon has found a satisfying
way to do it.

   TAKE-BOS  
 UNDATED: ... way to do it.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In her book ``Garden Artistry,'' Dillon writes of cheerfully
mixing ``a glorious muddle of different blues, never minding
whether they are turquoise, sapphire, or lapis lazuli. Purists will
say that you shouldn't mix pure blues with mauve- or violet-blue,
but the loveliest effects can be made by breaking the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The stars in Dillon's celebrated ``blue garden'' in Dublin are
delphiniums, monkshoods, Aster x frikartii Monch, and Aster
thomsonii Nanus. They are accompanied by an ever-changing
supporting cast of self-sowing annual blue love-in-a-mist and
larkspur, and annual Indigo Spires and patens and uliginosa
salvias. Blue perennial supporting players include catnip,
stokesia, echinopsis, campanulas, violas, and eryngiums.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also a lot of mauve and white flowers in this blue
garden for accent, including penstemons, agapanthus, gypsophila,
cow parsley, and goat's rue. Towering teasels and other gray
foliage plants also tone down differences between the various
shades of blue.
</P>
<P>
   A blue garden that attempts to use only true-blue flowers is
walking a narrow tightrope. One plant in the wrong shade of blue
can injure the whole brittle picture. But Dillon's technique of
incorporating a broad range of blues shading into purple is safer
and easier.
</P>
<P>
   Harper has taken a similar approach. ``I would not attempt a
blue border,'' she said. But she does combine gray, purple, and
white with blue. ``I love that combination. It's interesting but
not loud, and it gives me an enormous range of plants.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper's Virginia garden includes the colored foliage of
eupatorium Chocolate, purple smoke bush, cutleaf maples, purple
barberries, and annual perilla. The flowers, mainly blue and white,
include asters, Campanula latifolia, amsonia (an underappreciated
favorite and a great second fiddle), Siberian iris, and catnip, of
which she says, ``it's not an exciting blue, but it's very long
blooming and has gray-green leaves.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Blue spontaneity
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cool colors, with their emotional association with water, are
more restful to live with than warm colors, especially in the
summer when the weather is hot. Even if it hasn't been designed
with any forethought, a garden with a lot of blue, violet, and
green tends to look less a hodge-podge than a similarly unplanned
bed of red, yellow, and orange.
</P>
<P>
   This is one reason why blue flowers are an easy favorite with
spontaneous gardeners who like to make impulse purchases at
nurseries and then wander around their yards looking for a spot for
their new plants. Blues are easy mixers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always stopping at nurseries and buying plants, and I
always buy ones with blue flowers,'' said garden writer Elvin
McDonald, author of ``The Smith &AMP; Hawken Book of Orchids''
(Workman). ``I know they'll fit in.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Blue compliments
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blue goes with everything. But what goes with blue?
</P>
<P>
   There are other plants that can help your bluish flowers to
sparkle rather than sulk. For instance silver and gray foliage
plants such as artemisia make blues, and all other colors, look
more brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitively sited oranges and yellows make blues more exciting.
Try planting bright-blue Siberian scilla under your yellow
forsythia.
</P>
<P>
   White also acts as a complimentary color with blue. Try a carpet
of blue perennial forget-me-nots with white Triumphator
lily-flowered tulips.
</P>
<P>
   If you have purple-blue flowers like perennial geraniums,
cream-colored flowers such as aruncus and plants with creamy
variegated foliage will play down the violet, making near-blues
look darker instead of redder.
</P>
<P>
   Photographer Harper, who wrote ``Designing with Perennials''
(Macmillan), likes to combine blues with sunset colors such as the
apricot heading toward orange that you find in dianthus Doris and
the Newport strain of sweet william. Apricot Beauty and similar
tulips look delicious with blue pansies or scilla. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Blue foliage
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A leaf doesn't have to be very blue to look bluish. Because most
foliage is green-yellow, even a small shift toward blue-green
creates an impact.
</P>
<P>
   Some plants, rue for example, have definitely bluish foliage.
Contrary to what you might assume, however, blue foliage doesn't
combine well with most blue flowers. After all, most blue flowers
are blue-purple, while most blue foliage is blue-green, putting it
on the other side of the cool/warm demarcation you don't want to
cross.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the most beautiful bluish leaves are glaucous, defined
as ``of a dull green passing into grayish blue'' by the Oxford
English Dictionary. This quality is created by a fine coating of
hairs that reflects light, reduces transpiration, and thus helps
the plants thrive in hot, parched situations. The brighter the
sunlight, the bluer they look. (It's the opposite with most blue
flowers.)
</P>
<P>
   These ghostly plants include many poppies, hostas, sedums, and
the giant mullein volunteering in my gravel pit. They are lovely in
their own right, but if you place them next to blue flowers,
they'll push them toward purple. So don't. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Blue paint
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's so simple it sounds like cheating, but a can of paint in
your exact favorite blue (and that shade is doubtless much easier
to find in a paint store than a nursery) can go a long way toward
injecting just the right blue note in your garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why people have been so slow to paint structures
in the garden. I was a little shy at first, but now I'm fearless,''
says garden expert McDonald. ``Martha Stewart has wonderful outdoor
paints for the garden, but I buy it off the rack. I painted a
potting bench Cape Cod blue and people loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   If true blue is too strong a statement, take your cue from
glaucous blue foliage plants. That green-grayish-blue compliments
the garden and looks quietly handsome on its own through the
winter.
</P>
<P>
   You can also use small blue garden accessories. McDonald, whose
newest books include a four-volume series on roses published by
Smithmark, uses blue Malaysian pots for his container plantings.
His cleverest trick may be simply moving a blue plastic watering
can around the changing garden picture wherever a touch of blue is
needed to compliment what's in bloom. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Blue for shade
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blue flowers look their best in shade or on an overcast day.
Because blue is a fairly weak color, sunshine kills its impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``In bright sun you need the screaming colors that fight back
like white, which is actually a very strong color,'' says Harper.
</P>
<P>
   Perennial flowers that can tolerate deep shade are relatively
rare. But among the blues they include the underused perennial gems
omphalodes and pulmonaria, as well as violets and the ground cover
periwinkle.
</P>
<P>
   Most plants need sun to flower their best, so light shade is
preferable to heavier shade. For shrubs, try Blue Wave hydrangea or
Bluebird rose-of-Sharon. Platycodon, woodland phlox, catnip,
Lobelia syphilitica, Siberian iris, columbine, campanula,
centaurea, echinopsis, gentian, hardy geraniums, amsonia, and
adenanthera are perennials that flower tolerably well in light
shade or part-day sun.
</P>
<P>
   Many blue spring bulbs will tolerate shade, and since they bloom
before the trees leaf out, more sun is available to hyacinths,
camassia, and chionodoxa. Spanish and Siberian squill will tolerate
deep shade.
</P>
<P>
   For annual blues in shade try nigella, lobelia _ particularly
pale Cambridge blue and the new darker Riviera _ and Crystal Bowl
Blue or Sky True Blue pansies. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Blue shrubs and vines
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shrubs of the blue persuasion come on during summer and fall,
when their color is most needed.
</P>
<P>
   The mophead hydrangea comes the closest to true blue among
northern shrubs, and it's wildly variable and borderline hardy
here. Most of the hydrangeas you see growing here are the hardier
white kinds, like Annabelle and the treelike pee-gee hydrangea. But
mopheads grow luxuriantly on Cape Cod, thriving in seaside
conditions. It's worth a try in Boston and along the coast _
anywhere a gardener hungers after easy summer blue. Hygrangea
macrophylla Otaksa is a new hardier mophead with huge blobs of blue
most of the summer. Acid soil is the key to blue color, and you can
get a bush that's half blue and half pink if part of it fronts on a
lawn that has been limed.

THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT A STONE HOUSE _ BUILT BY HAND  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It all started in 1987, when Ralph Weaver built a stone house,
literally by hand.
</P>
<P>
   He thought it a good idea to tell somebody about it; after all,
stone houses are not built by hand every day. So he sent the
Globe's handyman a picture of the house and a letter wondering if
the handyman would be interested. The handyman replied fairly
quickly, by letter, having failed to find Weaver in the phone book.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the handyman wrote, that looks and sounds like a good
idea, so let's set a date. The handyman promptly forgot about the
letter.
</P>
<P>
   So did Weaver. (itals)Nine years later(unitals), he found the
handyman's letter while rummaging through some house documents.
Unopened.
</P>
<P>
   From then on things moved at lightning speed. Weaver wrote the
handyman, with some chagrin, enclosing the letter and another
suggestion for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   This time he enclosed his number, which the handyman promptly
called to make a date. Weaver could not explain how the letter was
never opened and then put away, but did say that he has another
stone project in mind, and bought equipment to handle the stones.
``This is necessary, because for some unknown reason, the stones
that they have today are much heavier than the ones I used in
1987.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the stone house in Carver, Mass. is not Weaver's first
project. He built a 24- by 24-foot stone garage, ``to see if I
could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, a retired policeman who will turn 50 next November,
found that he could do it _ the garage went up in one summer _ so
he tackled the much bigger house with confidence. Confidence he
needed; the house is 36 by 42 feet.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Joanne, and two children, who live with him in Newton,
Mass., are tolerant supporters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but why stone? ``I bought the land in 1982, then I read a
book about stone walls, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver admits knowing zero about stone, but he wasn't afraid to
try.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mason told me about the old stone houses in New England that
are much admired today. They were built by farmers who knew nothing
when they started.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So, why not me?'' he said. He started the right way, building
a huge foundation to hold the great weight of the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver used slip-form construction as described in the first of
several books he read. And here is how it works. For one thing, it
allows walls to be built by two men. ``Me and another guy,'' Weaver
said.
</P>
<P>
   He built forms, similar to those used in pouring concrete, but
only four feet high. The forms were set on a cement-and-slurry coat
on the foundation and the first course of stones put in place.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure the stones have at least one flat face, said Weaver,
and set this face on the outside wall of the form, so when the form
is removed, the flat faces of the stones will show.
</P>
<P>
   Then add concrete on top of the first course and behind it and
between the stones. This concrete is the mortar, holding everything
in place. The concrete fills the form toward the inside, so that
the inside surface looks like a regular poured concrete foundation,
more or less. It's not very neat, but a framed, insulated wall
covers that inside of the stone wall.
</P>
<P>
   As the form is filled, the concrete is allowed to set overnight;
then the form is raised and secured and the procedure starts all
over again to complete the wall.
</P>
<P>
   It took Weaver and ``the other guy'' six months to complete the
four sides.
</P>
<P>
   One problem that Weaver ran into was how to handle the concrete.
He couldn't order ready-mixed concrete, because the wall work was
slow, and some of the ready-mix would set before it was used.
</P>
<P>
   So Weaver mixed his own, a classic 1:2:3 mix, 1 part Portland
cement, 2 parts sand, and 3 parts crushed stone. He bought a mixer
for $75 from used goods magazine and put an electric motor on it.
It worked out well.
</P>
<P>
   From then on it was easy: framing and finishing.
</P>
<P>
   The wall comes out like a riprap conglomerate wall, which is
exactly what it is. The joints are deep and somewhat crude, but
that wall is going nowhere for several hundred years. No, a
thousand years.
</P>
<P>
   And just think, no painting, staining, sealing, or any other
treatments, even repointing, for a thousand years.
</P>
<P>
   With an eye toward his new project, he bought a bigger mixer, a
Seabee surplus machine from the Yankee Swapper in Rhode Island. He
also bought a big logging claw, designed to wrestle logs around,
but, he says, ``I'll use it to haul all those heavier stones
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver isn't quite sure what his next project will be, but you
can bet it will be with stone.

HAPPINESS IS FIRST THINGS FIRST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Resting in a hammock last week, I had time to think about the
hectic pattern of my life, how I ricochet from overbusy to fairly
relaxed to far too busy again. It's as if I'm asleep as this
process unfolds again and again. Then, every time I wake up and
look around, my calendar is somehow full to the brim.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did this happen?'' I ask myself, bewildered for the
hundredth time. Faced with too much on my plate, I can't remember
the preliminary thoughts or acts that led me here, can't identify
any warning signals that might have alerted me in time to make a
correction. I know I've been in this mess before because I
recognize the stifling feeling of being trapped, but without any
idea of how I keep recreating this situation, I lack the tools to
keep history from repeating itself.
</P>
<P>
   Two of my readers, Pat Steuert and Susan Porter, sent me a
monthly planner they created called ``A Balancing Act.'' It's a
small spiral calendar book with unusual directions. At the
beginning of each month, you're instructed to take 30 minutes to
make sure you schedule time for yourself. At the back of the book,
there are places to jot down those stray longings that hit you at
your busiest moments: The books you'd like to read, the friends
you'd like to visit, the classes you'd like to take, the movies
you'd like to see, places you'd like to go, all your neglected
wishes, hopes, and dreams. With these at your fingertips, every
month you get a chance to make sure you make space for the things
that matter.
</P>
<P>
   This looking ahead and planning for the future, it seems to me,
has the potential to repair anyone's badly skewed long-range
perspective about time. It's a chance to see the future coming
instead of having it take you by surprise. You get to anticipate
everything that is sure to happen instead of having predictable
events suddenly show up to haunt you. You get to decide in advance
how many projects you can comfortably take on rather than
discovering too late that you're swamped.
</P>
<P>
   Without this corrective, many of us fill our regular calendars
with so many obligations, meetings, work dates, and special events
that we're left frantically trying to squeeze in what remains of
our life. Our days often seem as stuffed to the gills as the mason
jar in this Norris Lee story sent to me by one of my readers,
Jeanne Rudnick.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A lecturer stands in front of a class of high-powered
overachievers, holding a 1-gallon wide-mouth mason jar. He fills it
with good-size rocks, then asks the group, ``Is this jar full?''
The audience agrees that it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, really?'' he asks. He pours in several handfuls of gravel.
``Is the jar full now?'' The audience is doubtful. Probably not. He
pours a handful of sand into the jar, filling it to the brim. ``How
about now?'' he asks. Not yet. He pours in a pitcher of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' he asks. ``What's the lesson to be learned here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' says a man sitting near the front, ``you've just
demonstrated that no matter how full your schedule is, you can
always fit more in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're absolutely wrong,'' says the teacher. ``The point I'm
making is that if you don't put the rocks in first, you'll never
get them in at all.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is where you get to make your true values visible. What's
your definition of a rock? A business meeting or a child's
basketball game? Organizing your files or reading a book? Staying
home or attending a meeting? If you don't make such choices
consciously and well in advance, all the forces demanding your
attention in this fast-paced world will make them for you.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you really reflect upon it, you might not want to
stuff your jar of days full of every rock, bit of gravel, grain of
sand, and drop of water it will hold. There's almost no room for
movement in that crowded a space, no room to breathe. Ignore this
fact until after the water's in and the cover's been tightened, as
I do with distressing regularity, and you will discover to your
sorrow that the compacted life feels a lot like drowning.

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ACTON, Mass. _ Tatiana Benharbone strains forward in the
driver's seat of her taxi, gesturing with one hand flying off the
wheel, sometimes two. The Volkswagen van glides down Route 2,
slipping into Boston at dusk.
</P>
<P>
   It is an hour when, in the glare of headlights and under the
dark canopy of sky, fairy tales seem possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think I'm not really from this planet,'' says
Benharbone. ``That's what saves me.''
</P>
<P>
   Benharbone's home planet would be a world where gypsy dancers
spin to the beat of Spanish guitars, where horses leap through
fields of pastel fog. A land where a person can live many lives.
</P>
<P>
   Benharbone has wandered from life to life, continent to
continent. She has crossed European borders hidden in a covered
wagon, peered from windows of Jerusalem buses, always searching,
reaching out for some elusive comfort.
</P>
<P>
   A Jew born in Poland in 1937, Benharbone was raised Catholic by
a family who, by taking her in, spared her from the Treblinka death
camp where her parents and grandmother died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like I was from anyplace,'' says Benharbone. ``I
didn't know who I was or where I was going. I felt like a displaced
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving a cab has become the latest vehicle for Benharbone's
wanderlust. Today, she speeds down Boston-area highways, acting out
her rootlessness. Her unsettled nature, common to many Holocaust
survivors, is a product of the World War II era when she and
millions of other Jews were forced to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
   A half-century later, 891 Holocaust survivors live in
Massachusetts, according to the registry of the Holocaust Museum in
Washington. Most are elderly. Benharbone is one of the few who
remain in the working world.
</P>
<P>
   Benharbone's postwar journey began on the doorstep of an
orphanage, where she was left clutching a rosary and New Testament,
with no idea what it meant to be Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   The little Polish girl grew into a flamenco dancer who twirled
her way through New York, California, Spain, and Israel, commanding
attention on stage with the thump-thump of her high heels, with her
dark beauty and wild hair.
</P>
<P>
   That gypsy dancer became an artist whose political cartoons and
whimsical animal dreamscapes were snatched up on the streets of
Toulouse, France.
</P>
<P>
   After she had saturated the Toulouse art market, Benharbone
landed back in America, because the $200 plane fare to New York was
the same price as a bus ticket to Nice. Now the
orphan-turned-dancer-turned-painter is the owner of ABC Taxi, a
one-woman cab company she has run out of her Acton home since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Once widowed, once divorced, living far from two adult children,
Benharbone is still searching, still running. She continues to play
hide and seek with the loneliness that has shadowed her from
childhood. At age 60, she is more comfortable in motion than at
rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I wake up in the morning and everything hurts,'' she
says. ``But as soon as I get going on a cab job, I'll start talking
to the customer and, it's neat, I feel a lot better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in my house, sometimes it feels really strange, kind of
lonesome and empty. Acton isn't home. I don't think anyplace is
home.''
</P>
<P>
   She left her first home as a toddler. Her parents had already
disappeared into the chaos of wartorn Warsaw, ultimately bound for
the death camps. Her grandmother woke her one night, she remembers,
and took her to a family in Krakow.
</P>
<P>
   That night exists as a series of snapshots in her mind _ a
bundle of blankets, a team of horses, staring despairingly into a
bowl of noodle soup in her strange new home.
</P>
<P>
   Her grandmother promised to come back. She never did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting with my grandmother, every time I formed an
attachment with someone, they disappeared,'' Benharbone told
historians from the Holocaust Museum.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, she was given up by the family that hid her, and
wound up in the care of Lena Kuchler, a Polish Jew who, like
Benharbone, passed as Catholic to survive the war. Kuchler gathered
Jewish orphans under her wing, later recording her story in a book,
``My Hundred Children.''
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that postwar violence against Jews in Poland threatened
the children's lives, Kuchler snuck her brood into France and
eventually took the group to Israel. Benharbone, one of the
youngest, was adopted from France by an American family, perhaps
because she was ``too frail and dreamy for life on a kibbutz,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Benharbone does not like to talk directly about the
Holocaust, which she calls a tired subject. She does acknowledge,
however, that a disrupted childhood has shaped her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this terrible hole inside you,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Benharbone's days of running did not end when she came to the
United States. Too raw and troubled for her adopted family, she
says, she moved in and out of their Cambridge home and, after
graduating from Simmons College in Boston, ran off to dance in New
York in 1961. There she met her first husband, flamenco dancer and
choreographer Roberto Iglesias.
</P>
<P>
   The two dancers performed together throughout Europe and Israel.
After Iglesias died of a heart attack in 1972, Benharbone started
her own dance company in Israel. The Jerusalem Post wrote of ``the
astonishing Spanish dancer Tatiana ... whose flying heels, toes,
knees and other appendages have to be seen to be believed.''
</P>
<P>
   Flamenco spoke to Benharbone, who identified more as a gypsy
than as a Jew. ``The soul of flamenco deals with pain, it comes
from an oppressed people,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Benharbone remarried and settled in France with her two children
from her first marriage. An overzealous doctor, whom she now
curses, told her a bad hip made dancing too risky. She turned to
painting to express her restlessness, her love of movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always try to create things that are beautiful, that don't
really exist,'' she explained in the interview with Holocaust
Museum historians. ``I never wanted to deal with the anger and the
pain. Inside me there's this tremendous rage. Sometimes I feel it
and it scares me.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the Boston area was a disappointment to Benharbone,
and it strained her marriage to the breaking point. With no way to
make a living as an artist, she founded ABC Taxi. With the
exception of a short break to dance in California, the taxi has
been her life work ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started with ABC I was lonely and divorced, and
it was great for me,'' she says. ``The phone would ring and I would
get to go on a ride somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Benharbone has struggled with boredom, and with the back and
neck pain that come from driving all day. But she tries to find
purpose in her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business has kept me alive and paid my bills,'' she says.
``It also helps people by getting them where they need to go. It's
not painting, it's not dancing or poetry or creating beauty, but it
does a practical good.''
</P>
<P>
   And it keeps her moving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on a spiritual search now,'' says Benharbone. ``I write
songs, I write poetry. Words just come to me and I record them when
I'm walking my dog in the woods or driving the cab early in the
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, she adds, ``I have a dream to get myself in an RV and
just go, just drive out to the Grand Canyon.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the journey to Logan and back suffices. She
jokes with her customers, but she rarely tells them personal
stories, saying, ``My own life is not that interesting.'' She takes
her dog, Kitty, along on most trips, and gives her cars names like
``the flying phroomph.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you always look forward to new adventures, new exciting
things, new learning experience,'' she says, ``then it's OK. You
can get through.''

GETTING PERSONAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOUG BAILEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't really believe I'm smarter than the average Macintosh
loyalist, but I remember being at MacWorld several years ago when
Apple introduced the Newton Personal Digital Assistant and thinking
that all the enthusiastic attendees shelling out hundreds of
dollars for the little device were wasting their money.
</P>
<P>
   I never caught the Newton bug. It was a great idea but the thing
was too big, too dim, and the handwriting recognition program left
much to be desired. I first picked one up at a 1990 Apple
conference in San Jose and wrote ``hello'' on the screen in
longhand, which the computer translated as ``little.'' Beyond the
fun of some comically erotic translations of my scrawl, I could
find no practical use for the Newton. And when Apple folded the
Newton experiment last year, I resisted the temptation to say I
told you so and forgot about PDAs all together.
</P>
<P>
   Even when my brother showed up one day with a PalmPilot by 3Com,
I scoffed. ``What do you do with it?'' I asked. Mostly it seemed to
be an electronic Rolodex that also played Space Invaders. I need
this? And when he told a story of being in a recent meeting when
seven people around the table all suddenly pulled out their
PalmPilots, I roared. How geeky can you get?
</P>
<P>
   Then a few weeks ago a friend of mine who works at Lotus
Development Corp. was seriously extolling the virtues of the
PalmPilot, and this time I listened. Her husband said he was
getting one too. Some quick research and I realized I was way
behind the PalmPilot curve. And, of course, I can't have that.
</P>
<P>
   3Com has sold more than 1 million PalmPilots in the last two
years, making it the most successful pocket-sized computer on the
market. Casio, Hewlett-Packard, Phillips, and even Microsoft all
sell handhelds or will soon, but clearly the business belongs to
3Com at moment. It holds about a 65 percent market share.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking I had perhaps underestimated the device's attraction, I
recently bought a PalmIII, 3Com's third generation Pilot that was
released earlier this year. I can't say that owning one has been a
life-changing experience, but I am a convert. The PalmIII now holds
my contacts, phone numbers, appointments, memos, e-mail, and
miscellaneous scrawlings.
</P>
<P>
   With the optional modem, I can send and receive e-mail and even
surf the Web when I'm away from the office or home.
</P>
<P>
   The PalmPilot's best feature is the ability to instantly
synchronize data between your home and office computer. In fact,
it's easier to input data to your desktop and transfer it to the
PalmPilot with a push of a button. It supports Lotus Notes and
desktop organizers. 3Com also intends to make the PalmIII double as
a pager, a feature already available in earlier PalmPilot models.
</P>
<P>
   The best news for Mac users is that the PalmPilot is about to
become more compatible with their home and office machines. Later
this summer 3Com plans to release a new MacPac system to improve
connections between the PalmPilots and Macs as well as a version of
Claris Organizer software. 3Com bought Claris Organizer from Apple
last year. The program integrates calendar, contacts, tasks, notes,
and intelligent features such as drag-and-drop scheduling, custom
views, and printing options in one application.
</P>
<P>
   All current Macintosh users of the Palm III, like me, who bought
the original MacPac version 1.0, will qualify for a free upgrade to
the new Palm MacPac software. The free upgrade can be downloaded
from the company's We bsite for 60 days after the product is
released, at http://www.palm.com.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to support. Unlike the Newton, which was
virtually orphaned by software developers _ and eventually by Apple
itself _ the PalmPilot benefits from scads of support, not just
from 3Com but from third-party producers, shareware developers, and
other sources. The best sites can be found at the palm.com site.
One of the new sites is Ziff-Davis's at
http://www.hotfiles.com/pilotsoftware.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a PalmPilot.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Addendum: I've heard all the news stories about Apple's new
iMac being a likely hit, but now I'm sure of it. My 68 year-old
mother bought one Wednesday.

WEST WAS A VOICE FOR BLACK MIDDLE CLASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  She opened the door wearing pink slippers and a flowered
house robe.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Dorothy West was a tiny, brown lady, but after two decades of
silence, she had become an important literary figure, once more.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago on the Fourth of July, I walked through a dark,
wooded area in the Oak Bluffs section of Martha's Vineyard, looking
for her home. As I found and entered her cluttered cottage, there
was a picture on her wall of a much younger West, a photo often
used in a poster of the Harlem Renaissance writers.
</P>
<P>
   West, who died Sunday at age 91, was the last living member of
that 1920s group, in which black writers made their marks on the
literary scene. She was the youngest of the stars, who included
Langston Hughes, Countee Cullen, Richard Wright, and Zora Neale
Hurston.
</P>
<P>
   It was an era that brought the black literary voice to the
forefront. The young, strong voices like that of West spoke
lyrically about the stench of racism and the sweetness and
bitterness of love. The authors wove together folksy tales of the
black experience.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, writing at a time when racism was arguably at its
worst, they were not ostracized, but hailed as the voice of the
time, West said. Over the years, the writers' circle faded, some
authors no longer in vogue, many eventually dying off, but quietly
West lived on, nestled in the Oak Bluffs home she summered in as a
child.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, though, West was only a distancing study in
African-American literature. She had published her first
book, &UR;  &LR; ``The Living Is Easy,'' in 1947, but for decades her life
seemed uneventful. That is, until 1995, when her smash book, ``The
Wedding,'' was published.
</P>
<P>
   Both books, though decades apart, explored a black middle-class
family in New England, ``The Living Is Easy'' in Boston, ``The
Wedding'' on Martha's Vineyard. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis urged
her to write the second book. Sometimes, West recalled during an
earlier interview, the former first lady-turned-book editor would
come to her little cottage, sit on the floor, and the two women
would talk about life and the progress of the book. She dedicated
the book to Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   Like the themes of most of her work, ``The Wedding'' dealt with
a web of issues involving the black middle class, including race,
the issue of skin tones among blacks, and interracial love.
</P>
<P>
   Although her stories were set decades ago, the topics are still
not easy for many African-Americans to swallow. Even now, in book
clubs throughout the country, her stories spur heated discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The issues that she wrote about sprang from her own life: West
was the daughter of an emancipated slave who became a successful
merchant; her mother was light-skinned. Her cousins, who shared her
four-story home in Boston, were very light-skinned _ so it was the
darker West who felt the brunt of nasty comments.
</P>
<P>
   But West always said it was the universal issue of class that
really interested her. She became one of the few black writers who
looked under the rugs of black middle-class lifestyles. Her
characters struggled with issues of love, ambition, and self-doubt,
and were not very different from whites.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that is why she was beloved by so many readers, regardless
of race and nationality.
</P>
<P>
   Until her death, fans continued to knock on her door, despite
signs that read, ``Please, no unexpected visitors.''
</P>
<P>
   She allowed these visitors to come in, and talked for hours with
them about the days of the Harlem Renaissance, about race and
class. She was like a walking literary anthology, happily
discussing her friendships with major figures such as Hughes and
Hurston. Two years ago, West said she was planning to write a book
about the black middle class in Oak Bluffs _ something she knew
well.
</P>
<P>
   She said she loved talking to young writers, since her time was
almost up. She said she wanted to spend whatever time she had left
enjoying life, writing, and busying herself with new ventures.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was enjoying her return to fame, but said sadly
that nothing could duplicate those great days of the past _ when
the black literary voice was king.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will never be a period like that again,'' she said.
``Never.''

CHANGES HERALD A TABLOID WITH SOFTER EDGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JUKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Come Monday, the Boston Herald's stark gray pages, short
screaming headlines, and harder tabloid edges may become a thing of
the past, replaced by a kinder, gentler, and more
lifestyle-oriented model.
</P>
<P>
   That is the day when the paper unveils an expensive redesign
that according to managing editor Kevin R. Convey is ``not just a
redesign'' but a ``rethink.'' The operative question is whether a
tabloid can successfully change its stripes.
</P>
<P>
   Two years in the making, the facelift will include: the use of
color, most prominently on the front and back pages; a new
front-page logo and a new Page 1 index to stories; 10 additional
pages including four more local pages and two additional world and
national pages; more frequent use of graphics; new and separate
fronts for the lifestyle and arts sections; a new body typeface and
a smaller headline typeface that will lead to more double-deck
headlines and fewer traditionally tabloid one- and two-word
headlines.
</P>
<P>
   According to editor Andrew F. Costello Jr., the format will
restructure pages 2 and 3 so that the former is more
consumer-oriented and the latter provides a ``more thematic'' look
at the day's news.
</P>
<P>
   The intent of the changes is to modernize and soften the look of
the Herald and bring more attention to areas like business, arts,
and features that have not been considered the paper's strong
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to broaden our reach and our scope,'' said
Costello, characterizing the new Herald as ``more contemporary ...
more in pace with the time.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the paper's editors, the redesign's costs included
about $4-$5 million to retrofit the presses with color equipment.
This has also coincided with the hiring of about 10 staffers from
graphic designers to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   One potential area of concern is Herald deadlines, which have
been moved up roughly one hour to accommodate the redesign. Another
is the impact of the changes on the paper's unions, which have
battled management over wages and health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We teasingly say we're very happy to see this great leap into
the '80s,'' said Tom Mashberg, chairman of the editorial bargaining
unit for the Newspaper Guild. ``We definitely feel the paper needs
to project a more serious appearance. ... Where we have a problem
on the labor side (is) a lot of people here ... are very
dissatisfied with our level of compensation and we have very poor
(health) benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Mashberg and Lesley Phillips, the president of the
Newspaper Guild Local 3102, say the investment and worker sweat
poured into the redesign will strengthen the union's resolve to
push for stronger contracts. (This one expires in November 1999.)
</P>
<P>
   ``People are concerned about being compensated and getting the
recognition from the employer who they have worked very hard for,''
said Phillips. ``We're going to say, `Hey, share the wealth.'''
</P>
<P>
   The paper's top editors said that the paper's unions had pulled
together to work on the redesign. ``There's been a lot of give and
take throughout this process,'' said Convey. ``It calls for a
dramatic change in the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufdots &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Herald columnist and WRKO-AM (680) talkmaster Howie Carr's
dust-up with Don Imus is getting serious. After Carr poked fun at
Imus's age, the New York-based syndicated talk-radio host
retaliated by suggesting repeated carnal encounters between Carr's
wife and former heavyweight champion Riddick Bowe. Upping the ante,
Carr's wife, Kathy, has hired legal gunslinger Alan Dershowitz to
handle her suit against Imus. Presumably, she is the one suing
because it is easier to win such a battle when the plaintiff is not
a public figure.

   More Monica mania: Capitalizing on the interest in President
Clinton's testimony Monday, Time magazine is rushing out an issue
that will appear on newsstands in 25 major markets today rather
than early next week. ``Our aim was not to be part of some rush to
judgment,'' insisted managing editor Walter Isaacson. ``We want to
give our readers solid information while they are making up their
minds about the week's events.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the public forgives Bill Clinton for the Monica Lewinsky
scandal is an open question. But citizens seems less likely to let
bygones be bygones when it comes to the media.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point was CNN's Sunday night three-hour ``national
town meeting'' to examine the Clinton crisis. Keenly aware of the
vociferous criticism of the media's coverage, host Jeff Greenfield
opened the show by solemnly intoning that ``in the spirit of the
late Joe Friday,'' the program would deal with ``just the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Within moments of that statement, Greenfield then turned to
several reporters and pundits who stated that Hillary Rodham
Clinton was participating in the final strategy sessions; the
president would acknowledge an inappropriate relationship with
Lewinsky and probably speak to the country; White House staffers
were feeling betrayed; and Clinton's political advisers were
leaking stories.
</P>
<P>
   With that breathless barrage out of the way, Greenfield took his
first phone call from an ordinary American.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think you're jumping the gun,'' she charged angrily.
``You (in the media) don't see yourself the way people in the real
world see you. It's disgusting.'' Click.

THANK GOODNESS WE HAVE SO MUCH TO FORGET TODAY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Americans can't remember anymore. We have a national epidemic of
memory loss. We're over the hill and over-scheduled. We're too old
and too busy to remember. What's wrong with me? I can't believe I
forgot her name. Have we been here before? What did I come here
for? What meeting?
</P>
<P>
   All this forgetting is a little strange in a nation that has so
many defining moments. Every time you turn on the TV there's
another defining moment. How do you forget a defining moment? Maybe
that's why we seem to have so many. We keep forgetting them.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible we need to forget. Who could fault us for not
wanting to remember a lot of what's been going on lately? But if we
fail to remember, we never learn from our mistakes. What mistakes?
Have we made mistakes?
</P>
<P>
   Forgetting comes in handy. I forgot to pick up the dry cleaning.
You forgot your dentist's appointment. If we try hard enough, most
of us can forget that certain person we once swore we'd never
forget. And, as we've seen recently, forgetting can be a good
career move. Did I do something wrong? I don't remember.
</P>
<P>
   With so much forgetting, memory improvement is big business.
Search the Internet, look in any bookstore and you'll find all the
help you'll ever need to improve your memory, and then some.
Schemes, cures, enhancers, systems, all of which seem to boil down
to the same thing: use it or lose it. Exercise your memory as if it
were a muscle. Keep your memory on its toes with puzzles,
challenges, games.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me to my idea for a board game for people who can't
remember anything. I thought of a good name for it the other day,
but I forget what it was. A sample follows.
</P>
<P>
   Question: Who is Kathleen Willey?
</P>
<P>
   a) Teenager who came between Bruce and Demi.
</P>
<P>
   b) Woman on ``Seinfeld' whose name Jerry can't recall, although
he thinks it rhymes with a part of the male anatomy.
</P>
<P>
   c) Star forward on the WBNA's New York Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   d) Winner of the Frozen Potato Products Institute's Martha
Stewart Cook-Alike Contest.
</P>
<P>
   e) None of the above.
</P>
<P>
   Question 2: Who said, ``I misled people.''?
</P>
<P>
   a) Lawrence Welk.
</P>
<P>
   b) James Thomas Brudnell, 7th Earl of Cardigan.
</P>
<P>
   c) Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   d) Bill Jurges.
</P>
<P>
   e) None of the above.
</P>
<P>
   Question 3. Who said, ``Yes ... once.''? Under what
circumstances did they say it?
</P>
<P>
   a) Jocelyn Wildenstein, when asked, ``Have you ever had cosmetic
surgery?''
</P>
<P>
   b) Donald Trump, when asked, ``Have you ever experienced a
moment of self-doubt?''
</P>
<P>
   c) Martha Stewart, when asked ``Have you ever had a hair out of
place?''
</P>
<P>
   d) My mother, when asked, ``Have you ever been wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   e) None of the above.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to all three questions is e), not that it matters.
Answers don't count in this game. Points are scored on the
following basis:
</P>
<P>
   One point for remembering to show up for the game.
</P>
<P>
   One point each for remembering the names of the other players.
</P>
<P>
   Three points for remembering the question.
</P>
<P>
   Two points if you need to have the question repeated only once.
</P>

 DOES M's BRASS HAVE WILL, SKILL TO FIX THINGS?  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Lou Piniella's shoes were covered in dust, which might
have been a good metaphor for a Mariner season covered in the
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But it was dust from something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was over at the new ballpark today,'' Piniella said
Wednesday, removing one of his shoes and wiping down the black
leather with care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, it's nice. The people of Seattle have something they can
be really proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not something the Mariners' skipper could exactly say
about his team's results in the standings or in the court of public
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   By now, all citizens of Marinerville understand that the
remainder of '98 will mean not much more than Alex Rodriguez's run
at 40-40; Ken Griffey Jr.'s usual amassing of hits, RBIs,
over-the-back catches and homers; and the development of the
youngsters soon to be called up from Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   And this is really strange.
</P>
<P>
   Here it is mid-August and the home team is dead. One trip down
to the Kingdome these days is all it takes to understand the depths
of this lost season.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Gate D, there used to hang a giant poster that featured
every one of the Mariner stars and starters. Jay Buhner. Edgar
Martinez. Ken Griffey. Alex Rodriguez. Jeff Fassero. David Segui.
Russ Davis. Randy Johnson. Joey Cora.
</P>
<P>
   Well, wouldn't you know it. Someone has gone and taken it down.
It's like the end of an era. The little star-studded Northwest team
that helped bring baseball back to life is gone.
</P>
<P>
   All that's left out there on the Kingdome exterior are big block
letters that say ``Gate D.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly the sort of alluring displaythat would attract
walk-up ticket buyers into the Kingdome, where expectations for
meaningful Augusts and Septembers were born in 1995, '96 (where the
M's were still in the AL West hunt until the final weekend) and
'97.
</P>
<P>
   But it makes sense that the poster has been removed.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is gone, finally, about eight months too late,
considering the best deal and the best way to have rid the team of
this problem would have been to trade Johnson last January.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Cora and Davis are either out of Seattle or on the trading
block, which means the M's must now search for a lead-off hitter,
second baseman, third baseman, and, yes, a No. 1 starter and a
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Cora gives you some clue, though, about the downtrodden
emotional status of the Mariner team, which has been left frayed
and deflated by months of indecision and lack of trades to try and
improvement the team _ all culminating in the botched Johnson
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Fallout continued even after the trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a meeting after Randy was traded and they didn't even
ask some of us to come,'' Cora said Wednesday, still extremely
disappointed and hurt by the way things unraveled this season.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, only the core group of Mariners (Rodriguez, Segui,
Buhner, Dan Wilson, Fassero, Moyer and Griffey) was involved in the
post-trade meeting in which Mariner vice president of baseball
operations Woody Woodward tried to diffuse anger over the Johnson
trade _ which brought no major leaguers from the Astros and had
players seriously thinking the M's were about to dismantle this
one-time contending team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm out of here, but that really hurt,'' Cora said. ``I
mean, I'm still out there busting my butt every day. But it's so
obvious I'm out of the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   There is still no clear indication that the chain of command
from ownership down to the front office will soon be put into
working order.
</P>
<P>
   For the Mariners to make any real improvements, something must
be done. One might guess that ownership is considering the notion
that someone, or some people, might have to pay for what went wrong
with the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   But ownership has some responsibility, too. It needs to make
known its priorities.
</P>
<P>
   No one will ever know what might have happened if ownership had
let Woodward and Chuck Armstrong offer Johnson the Roger
Clemens-type money ($8 million a year) they thought was
appropriate, even if Johnson's agents were demanding Greg Maddux
money ($11 million) or a trade.
</P>
<P>
   And after that did not happen, no one knows how much brighter
and happier 1998 would have been if Woodward had gone ahead and
pulled the trigger on an off-season Johnson deal. The Yankees,
Indians and Blue Jays all were ready to make a good deal, although
Woodward obviously thought he wasn't getting enough for Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   And no one is exactly explaining why ownership has decided to
meddle in the affairs of their baseball people _ unless, of course,
there is division or mistrust between ownership and the baseball
people.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Cora said, maybe none of the faceless 16 owners care.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got their ballpark,'' Cora said.
</P>
<P>
   But we can tell you this: It's August in Seattle and the home
team is out of contention. What happens between now and spring
training will tell the good citizens of Marinerville everything
they need to know about whether they should be proud or peeved.

LOVE STORY AT HEART OF `DANCE WITH ME' IS A DUD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A story of hearts in motion'' reads the tag line for ``Dance
With Me,'' and indeed, ``motion'' is the best thing about it.
</P>
<P>
   While the film is a mix of ``Dirty Dancing'' and ``Strictly
Ballroom,'' with a little ``Lambada'' and ``Staying Alive'' tossed
in, its dance sequences are terrific and crackle with energy and
style.
</P>
<P>
   But the love story at its heart is a resounding dud and the
script is addled with howler lines like, ``How do you dance without
music? It has to come from the music.''
</P>
<P>
   The film seems, at first, an odd choice for director Randa
Haines (``Children Of A Lesser God,'' ``The Doctor''), but then we
recall she also directed the flop ``Wrestling Ernest Hemingway,''
which featured a similar hot, humid atmosphere and a subplot
revolving around a character's obsession with ballroom dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Infante (Chayanne) has left Santiago de Cuba and come to
Houston in search of the man who may be his father. His mother has
just died, leaving Rafael with the address of a man, John Burnett
(Kris Kristofferson), who was the love of her life and with whom
she had a torrid romance two decades earlier.

   John owns a rundown dance studio and welcomes Rafael _ though he
doesn't know he's possibly his son _ with open arms. He gives the
young man a job as handyman and Rafael makes a big impression on
the regulars who frequent the Excelsior dance studio.
</P>
<P>
   But one woman, teacher Ruby (Vanessa L. Williams), isn't so
easily won. She is intent upon regaining her standing as the top
International Latin Ballroom dancer at the month-away competition
in Las Vegas and, as a single mom, has little time for flirtation
with a handsome stranger.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael gently breaks down her defenses and teaches her how to
feel the music and loosen up her rigid, disciplined technique. The
two slowly get closer and closer. But in the end, Ruby pulls away,
fearing the feelings she's succumbed to. How can Rafael prove he's
as serious about Ruby as he is about dancing?
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a stranger rolling into town and changing the lives
of everyone in the vicinity is a common cinematic staple.
Unfortunately, ``Dance With Me'' doesn't work on this elemental
level. The intended lovers have little chemistry and the usually
exquisite Vanessa L. Williams is shot so badly that she often looks
scary.
</P>
<P>
   During the climactic scene at the competition in Las Vegas,
we're distracted from enjoying Williams' dancing prowess because
her face looks frighteningly distorted and full of physical pain.
It's like a bad opera. And newcomer Chayanne smiles through the
entire film, utilizing a grin as his main charismatic weapon. In
fact, he smiles more than he dances.
</P>
<P>
   Other supporting characters are equally hammy. English actress
Joan Plowright is on hand as comic relief but her big scene is both
implausible and embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dance With Me'' works best when it relies on the understated
appeal of Kris Kristofferson and on the dancing itself.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, all that fancy footwork doesn't begin until an
hour into the film. But when it finally does, the payoff makes up
for the clich &UR; gfacute &LR; e of a story. The final dance competition is
great fun, and full of whip-cracking verve and stylish
choreography. Still, it only makes what's missing all the more
glaring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dance With Me'' looks great and is full of colorful climate,
but when the dancers aren't on screen, the love story trips all
over its big feet.
</P>
<P>
   Dance with Me. Directed by Randa Haines. Written by Daryl
Matthews. Cast: Vanessa L. Williams, Chayanne, Kris Kristofferson.
Columbia Pictures. 126 minutes. Rated PG for sexual situations,
language.

WHY YOU DON'T NEED A LAPTOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since it's the season for confessions, here's mine: I, Hiawatha
Bray, technology reporter, don't own a laptop. Never have, and with
luck, never will.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing against laptops, you understand. They're pretty cool _
until you switch one on and the red-hot Pentium chip inside sets
your lap on fire. And then there's the misery of running through
airports with 10 pounds of dead weight slung over your shoulder,
and the bother of turning it on under the suspicious eye of the
ladies at the metal detector.
</P>
<P>
   And heaven help you if you put the computer down for a moment
and turn your back. According to Safeware, a Columbus, Ohio,
insurer, thieves made off with over a billion dollars' worth of
laptops last year. That's not as remarkable a number as it sounds.
Laptops generally cost two or three times as much as an equivalent
desktop machine.
</P>
<P>
   I've been known to borrow a laptop from the Globe for a road
trip. Frankly, it's one reason I avoid road trips. And when I do
ship out, I look for excuses not to take a computer.
</P>
<P>
   I wish more of my guests would do the same. Several times a
month, computer executives drop into the Globe, laptops in tow, to
inflict a uniquely modern method of torture _ the PowerPoint slide
show. PowerPoint is a presentation graphics program that comes
along with the more useful parts of the Microsoft Office software
suite.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing that they're stuck with it anyway, some people can't bear
to let PowerPoint sit idle. Instead they waste hours of their time
whipping up a couple dozen tedious slides, and a half-hour of mine
showing them off.
</P>
<P>
   PowerPoint shows have their uses _ they're helpful when
addressing large groups, for instance. But more often than not,
they're a waste of good electrons. Next time you go to pitch a
client, print out your notes and charts on a few sheets of paper,
and leave the laptop behind.
</P>
<P>
   A computer also makes a handy way to carry around your address
book and appointment list, if you don't mind booting up every time
you have to check. Better to tote one of those pocket-sized digital
assistants for that purpose. There's the 3Com PalmPilot for around
$300, or the Franklin Rex, for as little as $129.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you don't have to carry your contact information at
all. Store it on the Internet, and it'll be available to you from
any Web site. The Cambridge-based PlanetAll Internet community
offers just such a service free of charge. It'll accept data from
Microsoft's Outlook information manager, or a PalmPilot, and links
to other information managers are under development.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to use your PlanetAll contact data, you need access
to the Web. But that's a mighty strange reason to haul a $4,000
gadget around. If you need a computer, use somebody else's. It's
taking long enough, but public Internet access points are gradually
popping up throughout the country. Alas, they're not always easy to
find. That's a good excuse to bookmark an impressive Internet site,
the Internet Cafe Guide at
</P>
<P>
   http://www.netcafeguide.com. Here you can find listings of 1,700
Internet cafes in 98 countries, and Internet kiosks in hotels and
airports.
</P>
<P>
   Cybercafes come and go, and you might not want to bet your
livelihood on one of them. The business services firm Kinko's is
another matter. There are 900 Kinko's shops in the United States,
with Internet-linked computers in every one. Expect to pay about
$12 an hour to use them, with extra charges for printouts.
</P>
<P>
   Once you're on line, you shouldn't have any trouble getting your
e-mail, as long as your company's mail server uses the standard
POP3 protocol. You can hardly visit a Web site without seeing an
offer for free e-mail service. Say you sign up for a free account
at Microsoft's HotMail site. You get yet another e-mail address to
play with. But you can also set it up to act as a mailbox for any
POP3 account you may have. Now you can get your e-mail wherever
there's a Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   None of this matters to some of you _ the engineers and such who
have to lug their high-tech firepower wherever they go. But amateur
gearheads like me can do without. And very likely, so can you.

`DEAD MAN ON CAMPUS' IS MOROSE AND CRASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poor Tom Everett Scott. After an impressive debut in the Tom
Hanks movie, ``That Thing You Do,'' the actor has slowly seen his
career take a downward spiral. First it was ``An American Werewolf
In Paris,'' now this odious and tasteless trifle.
</P>
<P>
   Even the opening credits are morose and crass in ``Dead Man On
Campus,'' with various methods of suicide integrated into the cast
and crew's names.
</P>
<P>
   The story is based on the urban legend that a ``dead man's
clause'' exists on college campuses that says a student will be
awarded a 4.0 grade point average if his or her college roommate
dies by murder, accidental death, violent death or slow death
within the room itself. Different variations on the theme survive,
but suicide is the method of choice in ``Dead Man On Campus.''
</P>
<P>
   Josh (Everett Scott) is a medical student from Indiana who is
putting himself through school on a scholarship. His roommate,
Cooper (Mark-Paul Gosselaar, who is does his best to impersonate
Jim Carrey in ``The Cable Guy'' here), is a rich party boy who
never goes to class and has eked by on his charms.
</P>
<P>
   Josh has to maintain a B+ average to keep his financial aid, but
after a few months with Cooper as his dorm mate, Josh's grades have
slid into the toilet. The pair embark on a scheme to take on a
third roommate _ one who is actively suicidal _ so they can claim
the ``dead man's clause.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair scout for potential candidates, finding three guys who
appear likely to fall off the edge. Cliff (Lochlyn Munro) is a John
Belushi-esque nutcase, Buckley (Randy Pearlstein) is a computer
nerd who wants to assassinate Bill Gates, and Matt (Corey Page) is
a black-hearted musician who sings songs of death.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, ``Dead Man On Campus'' drones on and on with its
one-note premise and the jokes fall flat and become tiresome after
awhile. Plus, it's offensive and inane at the same time. Who wants
to watch a bunch of losers try to off themselves? Even the movie's
protagonists turn out to be a couple of schmucks who find no
redemption and learn no lesson from their schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, Everett Scott will have better luck with his next
film, the Meryl Streep-starrer, ``One True Thing,'' because ``Dead
Man On Campus'' is so unfunny and pointless that it deserves to die
a fast death at the box office.
</P>

Traeger, Mike White. Cast: Tom Everett Scott, Mark-Paul Gosselaar.

`YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS' WILL INFURIATE, FASCINATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Neil LaBute's second feature, ``Your Friends and Neighbors,'' is
sure to both infuriate (at the preview screening, three people
walked out proclaiming, ``These people are losers!'') and
fascinate.
</P>
<P>
   His ``immorality tale'' about friendship, art, marriage,
relationships and, especially, truth packs a wallop equal to his
first black comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who thought LaBute would soften after searingly exploring
sexual politics and ethics within the corporate hierarchy in his
controversial ``In The Company Of Men,'' is sorely mistaken. If
anything he's gone a step further in risking alienation of the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your Friends and Neighbors'' is dark, entangled, nasty and
altogether possible.
</P>
<P>
   And that's a nod to LaBute's strength as a writer. Purposely
staged as a bawdy Restoration comedy, with a wide lens capturing
all the immoral details between six people who are old
acquaintances and friends, the film rings with emotional resonance
the further away we get in time.
</P>
<P>
   Mary (Amy Brenneman) and Barry (Aaron Eckhart, who gained 40
pounds to play the role) are married and living in their beautiful
new house. Their friends, the couple Terri (Catherine Keener) and
Jerry (Ben Stiller), pay a social call. What appears to be an
innocent visit soon becomes embroiled with darker subtexts.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry makes a pass at Mary and the perfect veneer is stripped
from the facade of both a happy marriage and Jerry and Terri's
romance, revealing the miserable cracks and gouges beneath. Jerry
pursues Mary. Terri becomes involved with a beautiful art gallery
assistant named Cheri (Nastassja Kinski).
</P>
<P>
   Using Jerry and Barry's best friend, Cary (Jason Patric), as the
``purveyor of truth'' and gauge of moral conscience, LaBute has
created a guide through the action who is adept at eviscerating his
friends by tapping into their deepest secrets. He's a solitary
perfectionist, bitingly smart and smugly content in his solitude,
maybe even a little sociopathic. Everyone wants what Cary has and
he thus sets the rhythm for his friend's covetous desires.
</P>
<P>
   It's tricky to ask an audience to like such difficult, abrasive
characters. But, surprisingly, LaBute makes us see the
vulnerability beneath the brittleness. And he's written long, talky
scenes that allow the cast to chew up the scenery and gives the
film a live theater feel. That intimacy, juxtaposed against the
word warfare in which the characters routinely engage, makes ``Your
Friends and Neighbors'' an unusual, difficult, thought-provoking
adventure into modern urban survival.
</P>
<P>
   In making a film that is better than his first movie, LaBute
created a unique and claustrophobic cinema of cruelty and social
commentary that we find riveting, no matter how painful the price.
</P>
<P>
   Your Friends and Neighbors. Directed and written by Neil LaBute.

Kinski, Jason Patric, Ben Stiller. Gramercy Pictures. 100 minutes.

`BLADE' PLAYS THE VAMPIRE THRILLER AS EPIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The vampire thriller is, of course, the most completely
overworked movie genre of the American cinema. It's been played and
replayed so often for comedy, burlesque, exoticism and horror that
it's become, for the most part, a cliche and a bore.
</P>
<P>
   But this week's edition, ``Blade,'' gives the formula some new
life by playing it as epic _ in fact, as apocalyptic epic. In this
film, it's the vampires that run the world, and the underdog humans
who have to try and take it back.
</P>
<P>
   The result is mesmerizing and often a lot of grisly fun. Horror
fans should eat it up, though a more mainstream audience will be
put off by the film's focus on torture, dismemberment and
blood-bathing, as well as teasing references to incest and
pedophilia.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the Marvel comic book, it's the story a stalwart
vampire hunter named Blade (Wesley Snipes) who stalks the noir
urban landscape dispensing justice to the uppity Undead _ via
silver sword, a gun that shoots silver bullets and canisters of
garlic mace.
</P>
<P>
   It's a big job because the vampires are institutionalized. They
have a secret treaty with the U.S. government, they run the LAPD,
and they have billions in offshore bank accounts. They make the
Mafia look like a neighborhood street gang.
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters, it turns out that Blade himself is a
semi-vampire, a ``daywalker'' _ a man with the strength of a
vampire but none of its weaknesses. So he has to keep taking a
special serum or he's likely to ``turn.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's the additional problem of a Gen X renegade vampire
named Deacon (Stephen Dorff) who, by studying the ancient vampire
scriptures, has found a way take control from the vampire
establishment and make himself ruler of the Earth _ if he can find
the blood of a ``daywalker'' to use as part of his ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the premise of the film _ its complicated vampire
mythology, and conventions of what the creatures can and cannot do
_ never really adds up to anything that makes any sense, even by
the liberal standards we apply to vampire fantasies. Try to analyze
this thing and you'll go nuts.
</P>
<P>
   The film also suffers from the casting of Dorff as the vampire
anti-Christ. He's a good actor and he makes a clear visual contrast
to hero Snipes, but his WASPish pretty-boy, boy-next-door presence
makes him altogether about as menacing as Mickey Rooney playing
Andy Hardy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the film is carried by the sweep of its style. Director
Stephen Norrington and his crew create a marvelously paranoid and
incorrigibly morbid comic-book world. The action sequences seem
remarkably original, surreal and exhilarating.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the rest of the casting works. Kris Kristofferson is just
right as Blade's folksy mentor; N'Bushe Wright (``Zebrahead'')
projects just the proper blend of vulnerability and spunk as
Blade's imperiled love interest; and Snipes makes a volatile,
soaringly resolute, splendidly mythic Savior of Mankind.
</P>
<P>
   Blade. Directed by Stephen Norington. Written by David S. Goyer.
Cast: Wesley Snipes, Stephen Dorff, Kris Kristofferson, N'Bushe
Wright. New Line Cinema. 120 minutes. Rated R for violence and
sexual references.

BAY STATE ECONOMY SHOWING SOME CRACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Massachusetts's unemployment is a mere 3.4 percent. Job growth
continues to outpace the nation. Home sales last quarter were
stronger than any time since the last housing boom in 1987. The
cost of occupying one of Boston's fanciest office towers has spiked
more than 20 percent this year. State tax revenues came in almost
$1 billion more than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the broad indicators tell a tale of a booming local
economy. But many of the mechanics who spend their days with their
heads stuck down in the grimy engine that powers the state's
economy see something else too: trouble ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the rosy scenario that is easily plotted on charts, the
evidence of a softening is mostly anecdotal. Corporate turnaround
specialists, brought into troubled situations, report business is
booming here. Bankruptcies aren't moving up yet, but law firms are
hiring bankruptcy attorneys in anticipation of brisk times just
ahead. The Boston Globe's help-wanted advertising, always a good
barometer of the job market, is turning down, particularly among
high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are clearly going to be an increase in underperforming
businesses in the next year to 18 months,'' says Marti Kopacz, who
works with distressed companies out of the Boston office of
PricewaterhouseCoopers, &UR;  &LR; the accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Edward I. Shifman Jr., senior vice president of Congress
Financial Corp., which lends to higher-risk companies: ``We're
seeing companies beginning to lose money that haven't lost money in
years.''
</P>
<P>
   These people who make their living monitoring the economy's
underbelly cite a number of problems, most prominently the collapse
in Asia, which has choked off sales and stiffened competition for
New England companies. The strong dollar is hurting local exports
and Asian competitors are so desperate for work they will do it at
almost any price, executives say.
</P>
<P>
   Another often-cited issue: excess capital that has made it all
too easy for weak firms to get cheap money and has eroded
underwriting standards at lenders. ``There is a lot of money
chasing a lot of deals, which means there are a lot of bad deals
being written,'' says David Ferrari, president of Argus Management
Corp., a South Natick firm that helps companies restructure their
debts. ``These companies are going to become very troubled, very
quickly.'' Peter Pelletier, who runs a similar firm in Braintree,
says money is so plentiful that troubled firms he counsels can now
get new financing in three months rather than the 18 months it
would have taken in the past. He says lenders are easing terms and
controls on loans to win the business. ``Problems are being masked
by borrowed money,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, both the Federal Reserve and the Comptroller of the
Currency, two agencies that regulate banks, have recently expressed
concern that the competition for lending has led to looser loan
standards, particularly in commercial loans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, New England's big banks, like most banks nationwide, were
taught some harsh lessons in the last recession and currently have
strong reserves to cushion against bad loans and a low percentage
of nonperforming loans. Leo Breitman, president of the
Massachusetts operations for Fleet Financial Group Inc., the
region's largest bank, is anything but alarmed by what he sees:
``Our current asset quality numbers have never been better in our
commerical loan portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists say the New England economy is still healthy and
growing. Payroll employment in Masachusetts grew 3 percent over the
year ending in June, compared with a gain of 2.6 percent
nationwide, according to the US Labor Department. New Hampshire was
the weak sister of the region over the last year, growing at just
0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But economists say, too, that the best of the expansion may be
behind us. A recent BankBoston survey found New England's volume of
manufacturing orders was deteriorating severely, a product of the
problems in Asia, and is starting to have a noticeable effect on
employment. Initial unemployment claims in Massachusetts are no
longer declining.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as good as it gets,'' says Fred Breimyer, chief
economist for State Street Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Perna, Fleet's chief economist, thinks that if there is a
slowdown ahead, the region is much better prepared this time
around. In the 1989-92 recession, New England was hit with a
double-whammy, the collapse of the minicomputer business and the
defense industry build-down. In addition, overbuilding in the real
estate industry was rampant.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Massachusetts lost 11 percent of its jobs to the
recession while the country lost just 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another recession, says Perna, ``wouldn't be fun, but there is
no reason for us to get hit disproportionately as hard as we did
last time.''
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, personal bankruptcy filings continue to rise,
but corporate filings actually fell 21 percent last year and
another 33 percent in the first six months of this year. But a
number of law firms, including Hale and Dorr, Goodwin Procter &AMP;
Hoar, and Mintz Levin, all report they are looking to add
bankruptcy attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is definitely an underside that has developed that
didn't exist a couple of years ago,'' says Richard Mikels, head of
Mintz Levin's bankruptcy practice.
</P>
<P>
   There's an old saw in the real estate business that says there's
no need to worry until you see the cranes in the air. Have you
looked up lately?

SEEING `HANDS ON A HARD BODY' IS WORTH VIEWERS' TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The documentary ``Hands on a Hard Body'' deals with such an
obscure subject _ a contest sponsored by a smalltown Texas
auto-dealer _ that it's probably going to have a hard time
gathering a great deal of initial audience interest.
</P>
<P>
   But those who venture into the the film are destined to be
richly rewarded: it's an often brilliant, always totally engrossing
competition movie of the first order, and the best documentary to
appear in a Seattle theater so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it's a movie that digs deep into a milieu that's
usually treated with considerable contempt by films _ the lower
middle-class South _ and presents an ensemble of characters who
prove to be considerably more noble and resourceful than their
stereotypes. In this respect, the film is strangely reminiscent of
``The Apostle.''
</P>
<P>
   The contest is an endurance test involving some 24 contestants
who are picked at random by a Longview, Texas, Nissan dealer from a
barrage of applicants. The contestants stand around a brand new
Nissan truck, keeping one hand on its body at all times. The last
hand remaining on the truck gets to drive it home.
</P>
<P>
   The contestants get a five-minute break every hour, and a
15-minute break every six hours. They can talk among themselves,
read, sing, listen to a Walkman, be interviewed by the local radio
station or by filmmaker S.R. Bindler. But the moment more than one
hand leaves the body of the vehicle, they're disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   The contestants are white, black and Hispanic, old and young,
mostly under-educated. As pre-event interviews are cut into the
narrative, we get to know their aspirations, their training for the
event or lack thereof, their strengths and limitations. Most are in
it for the money, others just want to own the ultimate Texas status
symbol.
</P>
<P>
   There's Benny, the returning champion whose running
philosophical observations are so funny and down-home perceptive
that he deserves his own talk show. And Norma, who's propelled by
the ``joy of the Lord'' and has a 200-person prayer network rooting
for her. And Kelly, a sweet kid who wants to win the truck so she
can sell it and stop waiting tables for a while.
</P>
<P>
   The hours drag on. Ten, 15, 20 hours. A few of the less
determined contestants begin to drop off. Then 30, 40, 50, 60
hours. Bodies get numb. Some contestants become delirious, others
hear voices and break into uncontrollable laughter. More fall away
_ especially the younger ones. ``Age and maturity will win this
thing,'' Benny tells us early on.
</P>
<P>
   As the contest goes on for 70, then 80 and toward 90 hours, the
movie puts us right on the edge of our seats. It uncannily
communicates the camaraderie the participants develop for one
another, the excruciating pain and sadness of dropping out after
such a punishing investment, the unusual reservoir of character
that dwells in the psyche of each of the finalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hands On a Hard Body'' is finally just one terrific
competition movie. It's all here: the thrill of victory, the agony
of defeat, even the heart-pounding, neck-and-neck finish that leads
to the surprise outcome. It may have been shot with home video
cameras on a total budget of under $10, but this little movie
delivers more excitement and drama than any of the summer's $100
million blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
   Hands on a Hard Body. Directed and edited by S.R. Bindler.
Produced by Bindler, Kevin Morris and Chaplin John Wilson.
Documentary. Legacy Releasing. 97 minutes. Unrated.

CONCRETE APRON OR CRUSHED STONE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I like your idea of putting a concrete apron around the house
to allow dripping water to hit the apron rather than dirt. What
about just using crushed stone around the perimeter; wouldn't that
work just as well, sort of cushioning the dripping water? But for
concrete, what formula can I use? How about Sakrete by the bag?
</P>
<P>
   DORIS ROBERTS, Dorchester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The apron or the crushed stone ``trench'' is used mainly on
houses without gutters, to prevent dripping water from splashing
onto dirt and staining the siding. The trench of crushed stone is
easy to make and will look good for years. One problem with a
trench is that it might allow dripping water to run down the
foundation and cause leaks. If that doesn't happen, the crushed
stone trench is the best way to go. It can be just a few inches
deep.
</P>
<P>
   The concrete apron will be neater looking and not only prevent
staining of the siding from splashing water but also, with any
luck, guide the water away from the house to prevent it from
running down the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   A typical apron is 6 or 8 inches deep, with a few inches above
ground, 18 inches wide, and sloped ever so slightly for runoff. The
width of the apron depends on how wide your roof overhang is. If
the roof overhang is, say, 24 inches, then you want to make the
apron at least 30 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Sakrete is OK to use for small projects, but a bag, even a
90-pound bag, will not go very far for an apron. So, instead, I
suggest renting an electric concrete mixer from a rental store. It
allows concrete to be made in medium-size batches and will provide
all the mixing muscle needed.
</P>
<P>
   As for a formula for mixing your own concrete, the classic 1:2:3
formula will do well: 1 part Portland cement, 2 parts sand, and 3
parts crushed stone. Add enough water to make a crumbly, not a
soupy, mix.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The oil tank has been in my house for at least 50 years and I
am wondering if it might be in danger of leaking. An oil man said
he thought it was leaking because he felt some oil on the bottom of
the tank. I put some absorbent clay under the tank and got no oil.
But considering the age of the tank, what can I do: Nothing, or
should I get a new tank?
</P>
<P>
   ANNA McKINNON, Quincy, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Wel-l-l-l, hard to say at this time. Many tanks are old like
yours and have given good service all that time. The question is,
how much longer will they last before leaking? It is an important
question, because a leak that spills oil on concrete and later into
the ground is the owner's responsibility, and cleanup can cost
thousands of dollars, even tens of thousands. It is no laughing
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, no one knows how long a tank will serve, although Tony
Markarian of MetroEnergy, an oil company in South Boston, says
tanks can be good for 20 to 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the good old days, oil companies used to strap liners under
the tanks to fix leaks or potential leaks, but Markarian said that
most no longer do this, mainly because a repair to an old tank is
iffy.
</P>
<P>
   So, you could do nothing and hope for the best, or, for your own
peace of mind, install a new one. They are expensive, but you'd be
getting 30 more years' peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one thing you could try, and this is risky too, so the
handyman suggests that if you have any doubts at all, don't do it:
Tap the bottom of the tank ever so lightly with a hammer; if it
rings, the tank is probably sound. If the hammer tap creates a
dull, nonmetallic thud, that part of the tank might be starting to
decay and rust. The risk here is that if you tap a hole in the
bottom, you'd better get a big bucket under it in a hurry, then
call your oil man for a new tank.
</P>
<P>
   One positive note about all this: A leaking oil tank will not
explode, and is unlikely to burn.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am installing a brick-in-sand sidewalk. If I keep going
level, the walk will end up 2 1/2 inches above the driveway. I have
to go another 6 feet; could I slope the sidewalk so it will be
level with the driveway?
</P>
<P>
   FRANK DRISCOLL, Walpole, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you started sloping the sidewalk the last 6 feet, the
slope will be nearly a half-inch per foot, a pretty good slope.
While it would look a little awkward, it will work. But you'd be
better off backing off another 4 feet so the slope will be along a
10-foot length. That would mean the slope is a quarter-inch per
foot. I just drew those slopes on paper, and while both would be
unobtrusive, I think the lesser slope along a longer stretch will
be more satisfactory. And since the sidewalk is brick in sand, it
is simply a bit of labor to back off 4 feet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I moved into a house with white ceramic tile and very dirty
grout. How can I clean it or color it an even color?
</P>
<P>
   CAROL ALLEN, Milford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Try cleaning it with bleach and water, and scrubbing with a
toothbrush. If it does not come clean, apply Grout Colorant, sold
in tile stores. Or, paint it with a dark-gray semitransparent
stain; the type that goes on clapboards or shingles. It is not
designed for grout, but it will stick quite well. The dark gray
will not show the dirt and presents a nice contrast to the white
tile.
</P>
<P>
   You can do the same on floor tile, but don't bother trying to
clean the grout. It never comes clean, and is better off stained
dark.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

`REGENERATION' IS A SCATTERED FILM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The setting of Gillies Mackinnon's well-meaning but terminally
dreary period drama, ``Regeneration,'' is a cozy asylum in Scotland
where British military doctors treat shell-shocked World War I
soldiers so they can be sent back to the trenches of France.
</P>
<P>
   The hero is the real-life English war hero and antiwar poet
Siegfried Sassoon (James Wilby), and the story is a fictionalized
account (from a highly acclaimed novel by Pat Barker) of his brief
incarceration there in the wake of his written protest of the war
in 1917.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict comes in the form of his doctor, Dr. William Rivers
(Jonathan Pryce), an eminent, fiftyish psychiatrist whose
assignment is less to judge Sassoon's sanity than to bring the
celebrated poet back to his nationalistic senses.
</P>
<P>
   But the conflict turns out to be not much conflict at all. Far
from being a Nurse Ratched, Dr. Rivers is gentle, kindly,
intelligent and a bit shell-shocked himself from dealing with so
many shell-shock cases. He can get angry at Sassoon's haughtiness,
but he likes and sympathizes with the poet.
</P>
<P>
   And the movie seems to lose interest in Sassoon after the first
act to concentrate on the problems of a more authentically
traumatized and equally rebellious patient (Jonny Lee Miller), who
went bonkers after a comrade was blown to bits beside him.
</P>
<P>
   As it progresses, the film gets even more scattered, moving
haphazardly around other cases in the institution, frequently
flashing back on the carnage in France, demonstrating the various
barbaric shock treatments of the time, and showing the impact of
war on a young widow (Tanya Allen).
</P>
<P>
   The film works best as a mood piece. The visuals _ especially
the numerous rainswept shots of the Scottish Moors in winter _ have
a bleak, haunting, end-of-the-world beauty that combine with the
immaculate period detail to give the film an unusual sense of
authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   It also effectively dramatizes one of the most touching
relationships in 20th century English literature: the friendship
between Sassoon and Wilfred Owen, an aspiring writer he met in this
institution who would posthumously become the Great War's most
famous poetic chronicler.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ``Regeneration'' might have been a more memorable
experience had it focused more of its attention on this
relationship, and less on the other, more familiar and (apparently)
fictional storylines that do nothing but batter our senses and
re-enforce what we already know going in _ that war is hell.
</P>
<P>
   Regeneration. Directed by Gillies Mackinnon. Screenplay by Allan
Scott. Cast: Jonathan Pryce, James Wilby, Jonny Lee Miller, Stuart
Bunce. Alliance Films. 95 minutes. Unrated.

`GADJO DILO' IS AN ENJOYABLE LOOK AT GYPSY LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The title character of Tony Gatlif's latest _ and most enjoyable
_ examination of Gypsy life, ``Gadjo Dilo'' (Crazy Foreigner), is a
determined young Parisian (Romain Duris) who, as the film opens, is
trudging across the frozen outback of Romania on a personal quest.
</P>
<P>
   All his life he's been haunted by the plaintive voice of a
Romanian Gypsy singer named Nora Luca, whose songs his amateur
musicologist father recorded many years before. Now that Eastern
Europe has opened up again, he's out to track her down.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his journey, he can find no one who's even heard of
the singer. But about the time his shoes wear out, he finally
stumbles upon a drunken old Gypsy named Izidor (Isidor Serban), who
has not only heard of Nora Luca, but actually claims to know her
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   The old man takes the young Frenchman to spend the night in a
shanty-town Gypsy community that uneasily exists near a larger
Romanian village. After sobering up, the old man remembers nothing
of the illusive singer, but he decides to adopt the Frenchman.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the movie settles into a light-hearted,
culture-clash comedy as the ``crazy stranger'' lingers in the
village _ gradually overcoming the community's knee-jerk suspicion
of him, becoming virtually accepted into the tribe and falling in
love with a beautiful belly dancer (Rona Hartner).
</P>
<P>
   Like the earlier Gypsy films of the Algerian-born, Spanish-Gypsy
director _ ``Les Princes'' (1982), ``Latcho Drom'' (1993) and
``Mondo'' (1995) _ this one has it both ways. It satirizes the
narrowness of Gypsy culture on the one hand, while wildly
romanticizing it on the other as a bastion of eccentric diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Even more than those earlier movies, however, this one is out to
please its audience with happy incidents and lovable characters.
Star Duris is all wide-eyed Gallic affability, Szerban is as wise
and durable as Zorba the Greek, Hartner is a '40s Hollywood vision
of hot-blooded Gypsy sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   It proves to be a fairly irresistible combination. One shocking
incident of ethnic cleansing aside, ``Gadjo Dilo'' is a happy,
funny, overtly sexy and gloriously life-affirming romp of a movie
that has the distinct smell of a major art-house hit.
</P>
<P>
   Gadjo Dilo. Directed and written by Tony Gatlif. Cast: Romain
Duris, Rona Hartner, Isidor Serban. Lions Gate Films. 97 minutes.

   FILM-HANDS (Undated) The documentary ``Hands on a Hard Body''

FASHION-CONSCIOUS KIDS CREATE BACK-TO-SCHOOL CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A generation ago, when the Crayola box held only six colors and
a kid's one and only pair of sneakers were Keds, back-to-school
shopping was as elementary as a Dick-and-Jane reader.
</P>
<P>
   If your child was a boy, you got him a haircut, new shoes, and a
Zorro lunch box and _ Voila! _ a freshly spruced-up young scholar
was ready for the demanding rigors of third grade.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping for college was only slightly more complicated. Fill a
steamer trunk with sweaters and skirts, buy a bean-bag chair for
the dorm room, and a young woman was all set.
</P>
<P>
   But in an era when some nine-year-olds know more about Calvin
Klein than Calvin Coolidge, it's not so simple anymore. Nowadays a
lot of back-to-school shopping is about high fashion and high tech,
and that's changed both the way parents shop and the way retailers
make money.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was small, it seemed all a kid needed was a new lunch
box,'' said vice president John Konarski of the International
Council of Shopping Centers. ``Now you need calculators,
minicomputers, and floppy disks.''
</P>
<P>
   Partly as a result, Staples Inc. can claim that ``August is our
Christmas,'' said Christina Erridge, a spokeswoman for the
Westborough-based chain of office supply stores.
</P>
<P>
   Between tony togs and floppy disks, the American Express Retail
Index estimates that $408 will be spent on back-to-school
merchandise and clothing this year for each grade-school and
high-school kid in the United States, up 3 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   All these changes have shifted shopping patterns.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as a decade ago, many mothers liked to hit the
stores early and do all their back-to-school shopping in one fell
swoop, said Raschel Gray, owner of two Raschel's children's
clothing and shoe stores in Foxborough and Westborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``By July 15, the lines were out the door and down the block,''
said Gray, adding, ``Customers would pick up everything at once _
they just wanted to get it all done.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Woods still shops that way.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the birth of her first child 15 years ago, a nurse
in her pediatrician's office tipped her off about Raschel's, and
she's been making an annual back-to-school pilgrimage ever since, a
50-minute drive each way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to go early when all the sizes are available, and
there aren't too many people,'' said Woods as she helped her
6-year-old daughter Brittany pick out a school wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   While some mothers still reduce back-to-school to a single big
shopping expedition, many others now make several small shopping
trips over several weeks instead, Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   One shopper adopting this strategy is Tracy Bailey-Gates, a
Rhode Island mother of three young sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll make several trips,'' she said as sons Brian,
Christopher, and Michael checked out baseball caps and football
sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   A retailer in her 25th back-to-school season, Gray offered
several theories to explain this change in shopping habits.
</P>
<P>
   Parents in two-income households are more pressed for time. So
are single mothers, who can't set aside a full day to buy kids'
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   But there may be another reason why, in many cases, a single big
shopping spree has been replaced by several smaller trips.
</P>
<P>
   Once, most kids wore what their mothers told them to wear
(though not always cheerfully). But some of today's 8-year-olds are
not only more fashion conscious than kids of yore; they also have
more influence on parents' purchasing decisions.
</P>
<P>
   While many third-graders still dress like little girls, some
underage clotheshorses want to wear the same styles of '70s retro
outfits, striped ensembles, and flaired slacks as their teenage
sisters, Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether third grader or high-school sophomore, these students
don't want to commit too soon to the wrong wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to go back to school first and see what the other
kids are wearing,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   So, instead of buying a full complement of clothing in mid
summer, some families are buying just one or two outfits, then
returning to the store in September to round out the school
wardrobe, Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Retail Federation has a military sounding name for
the phenomenon of students ``checking out what new styles are hot
during the first few weeks of school.''
</P>
<P>
   The federation calls it ``peer recon and review.''
</P>
<P>
   If fashion is king, Stride Rite Corp. could earn high marks from
students engaging in peer recon and review this fall. In recent
years, the Lexington, Mass. shoe company has signed licensing
agreements with top designers. Along with its well-known line of
children's shoes, Stride Rite now also offers shoe lines for some
students under such brand names as Tommy Hilfiger and Nine West.
</P>
<P>
   The back-to-school shopping period may be more important to
Stride Rite than ever. Once the company could count on seasonal
sales boosts in both the spring and the fall.
</P>
<P>
   But trends toward casual dress have ``reduced the importance of
Easter'' as a selling season, said John M. Kelliher, Stride Rite's
chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Brand-name fall fashion is also the focal point of a new
five-week marketing campaign the Filene's department store chain is
aiming at customers between 12 and 20 years of age.
</P>
<P>
   Showing photos of young people wearing clothes by Tommy
Hilfiger, Polo Jeans, Levi's, XOXO, and Calvin Klein, the goal of a
campaign with the slogan of ``Think it, be it'' is to persuade
young students that Filene's should be the ``first-stop
headquarters for back-to-school,'' said Paul Cavalli, Filene's
senior vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   While apparel stores are seeing a stretching out of the
back-to-school season, stores that sell school supplies and
computers can still see concentrated bursts of spending in August.
</P>
<P>
   Staples is one beneficiary of an August bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the year, Staples primarily serves small business
owners and people who work at home. But in August, store traffic
can swell from kids and parents loading up on school supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Best Buy Co., a Midwestern retailer about to open stores in the
Boston market, reports a similar phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``August is our biggest month for computer sales,'' said Best
Buy spokeswoman Laurie Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   All these changes are rearranging the retail calendar. Once
retailers could plan on big upward spikes in sales at Easter,
back-to-school, and Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Now consumers seem more likely to spend steadily all through the
year, buying items when they need them and not waiting until August
and December.
</P>
<P>
   The peaks and valleys of spending aren't ``as sharp as they used
to be,'' says John Macht of the Macht Group, a retail consulting
firm in Boston. ``But retailers can still make money if they plan
carefully.''

EDWARDS' STATUS IS STILL IFFY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ If No. 1 draft pick Robert Edwards had
missed this much time with a preseason injury under the previous
Patriots regime, the coach might have publicly questioned his
gender.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Terry Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   After Bill Parcells referred to the wide receiver as ``she''
because he had missed much of his first training camp with a
hamstring injury in 1996, Glenn was able to shed the label only by
catching 90 passes during the season.
</P>
<P>
   In the kinder and gentler atmosphere that surrounds the Pete
Carroll Patriots, Edwards will not have to deal with such
treatment. The 18th player taken in the draft, the running back
from Georgia has a history of injury problems, and his latest _ a
groin pull _ is legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm injured and I can't go out there and run the way I want
to,'' said Edwards. ``It's been a little frustrating, but I can't
rush the injury. I have to go out and let it heal completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday before practice, in which he participated, there was
concern about whether Edwards would be able to play Saturday's
exhibition in Washington. Despite Sedrick Shaw's 50-yard
performance against the Dallas Cowboys Monday night, it doesn't
take tarot cards to reveal that the Patriots want Edwards to emerge
as their new Curtis Martin. His emergence would vindicate the
Patriots for letting Martin go to Parcells's Jets as a free agent.
In fact, it would be a bonus, because Edwards was taken with one of
the compensation picks the Patriots received for losing Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards received a five-year, $5.75 million contract with a $2.7
million signing bonus. He's a big-ticket item. And as much as any
organization says, ``May the best man win,'' normally, it's the
highest-paid player who wins.
</P>
<P>
   While the Patriots say nice things about Shaw, they feel deep
down that Edwards is better.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Robert is able to play, he's gonna start the game and get
the reps to make up for the lost time,'' said Carroll. ``I thought
he would be ready for this game, but after talking to the trainer,
it's not set. It's very questionable right now.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Shaw, ``Sedrick continues to do solid things,'' said
Carroll. ``He's running very tough. He blocked well again. He's in
the process of learning what we need for him to learn. If Robert is
not available for a couple of weeks, we'll take on the course we've
been on. Harold (Shaw) is pounding the ball and Derrick (Cullors)
continues to make big plays. I'm feeling good about the situation.
I just wish Robert could get out there. But if we're starting the
season right now, Sedrick would start.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said he isn't afraid to test Edwards despite limited
camp time. He believes it might take two good games in a row during
the regular season to judge whether Edwards can handle the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not a big mystery, either,'' said Carroll. ``We know
what he can do. We know he's gonna run tough and catch the ball
well. I don't know if he's going to be dominant and take the job,
but we know what he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, a quiet man, has tried to avoid the spotlight until
he's ready to play. But even after Shaw's strong performance, the
spotlight seems to linger on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, I'm behind, but mentally, I'm in the game,'' said
Edwards. ``I see a play and I think to myself what I would do in a
certain situation. I don't think I'm going to have any problems
picking up the offense. The problem is trying to stay in shape.
Once I do get in there, I might have to come out just to get some
air. So the main thing is to keep in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, who has suffered foot and knee injuries in the past, is
dealing with a groin injury for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (the recovery time) has been slower than I expected,''
said Edwards. ``I haven't had one before. I did it in practice and
then reinjured it in San Francisco. I was able to start jogging
last week, but what you do on the football field is totally
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, starting out this way is not what Edwards envisioned.
If anything, he wanted to silence the critics who considered him
injury-prone and questioned why the Patriots would take him with
the 18th pick. Instead, Edwards, who gained 20 yards on six carries
at San Francisco in the exhibition opener before reinjuring the
groin, has only raised more doubts about his durability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things happen and you have to adjust,'' he said. ``This week
I'll take it to a higher level and see if it holds up. I'll take my
time because it's important that once it's healed, I can put it
behind me. Physically, I'm prepared, but my body might tell me
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll talks about accelerating Edwards's education. He will
give him the ball quite a bit during the next two days. He
dismissed any notion that Edwards would not be able to start the
season, indicating he should have plenty of time to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards realizes that everything he does or doesn't do is open
to scrutiny because of his status as the top pick. While there is
no longer a coach who would question why he's not on the field,
there are those who wonder what Edwards is all about and whether
they should begin to panic about the Patriots' running game.

TRADE TO REVOLUTION SURPRISES VETERAN DAMIAN ALVAREZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLESLEY, Mass. _ For the last two years, Damian Alvarez's
loyalty has been split between two teams, two leagues, two
countries. But things have become even more complicated in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   First Damian was sent from Las Chivas de Guadalajara to Club
America in Mexico City, where he will play after the Major League
Soccer season ends.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Saturday, he was traded from the Dallas Burn to the
Revolution, where he will perform for at least the next seven
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a change I didn't expect,'' Damian said Wednesday.
``It was a big surprise. One day, you go to sleep and you are with
Dallas. The next day, you wake up and you are playing with the
Revolution. Only in the USA.''
</P>
<P>
   Such late-season movements are very rare outside the United
States, though offseason dealings are numerous. Once the season
begins, there is little change, which is to be highly recommended
in a sport that requires time for a foundation to be established
and for a team to evolve properly.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the trade of Colombian midfielder Oscar Pareja to
Dallas for Damian seems a desperation move for both teams. Pareja
did not make a strong impact with the Revolution, who have MLS's
worst record as they prepare for Saturday's game against the Los
Angeles Galaxy. Damian scored only four goals before injuring the
medial collateral ligament in his left knee for Dallas, which is
near the bottom of the Western Conference this year.
</P>
<P>
   Though Damian is among the league's most explosive players, he
is not expected to save the Revolution, who have struggled
defensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our chances for the playoffs are not great but they still
exist,'' Damian said. ``And I am here to play and contribute
whatever this team needs. That is all I am interested in now _ to
make the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Damian was not at full speed during indoor training Tuesday
morning. He was encouraged by the reduced swelling in his knee and
was examined by Dr. Bert Zarins after the Revolution met the
Worcester Wildfire in a scrimmage at Babson College Tuesday night.
He kept his perspective and sense of humor while being treated by
masseur Adam Parret and trainer Mike Fritz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a left-footed player,'' Damian said. ``I have only one
leg, and it is injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Though defenders know Damian definitely favors the left side, he
is effective because of his athleticism, skill, and speed. Damian
credits genetics for much of his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was the same; we play the same position,'' Damian
said. ``He also played for Chivas and for the Mexico national
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Damian was born in 1973 in Vera Cruz, where his father, Pedro,
was playing, but soon moved to Guadalajara. He performed for Atlas
and for Mexico's under-21 national team against the US in CONCACAF
qualifying. Damian also played eight times for Mexico's national
team under Bora Milutinovic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has never been injured, so he is not sure how hard to push
it,'' Revolution coach Thomas Rongen said. ``It feels good after
playing in tight spaces indoors, so that is a good sign. He is not
game-fit yet. What he needs is a good practice, with contact, to
get his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's played in big games before 100,000 people, so he can
handle the pressure. But if he isn't ready, I don't want to do him
or the team a disservice by playing him. I don't want him to fail
in his first game, though this is a big game for us.''

SHE NEVER GOT RICH, BUT SHE HAD A ROYAL TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She was 80 and got two new knees and a new husband.
</P>
<P>
   That was 10 years ago, and Midge Whiting is now generously
reconciled to the fact that she won't dethrone Martina Hingis at
Flushing Meadow to claim the US tennis title that narrowly eluded
her 68 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She won't mind it at all if Hingis remains queen. ``I like
Martina's manner, that she can smile out there, even when things
don't go her way,'' Midge says.
</P>
<P>
   Marjorie Adele ``Midge'' Morrill Painter Whiting is a charming
90-year-old leftover from a time when an important tennis strategy
was learning how to play the king.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't beat him, but you didn't make it obvious, either,''
Midge laughs. ``Everybody went along. The king was a nice fellow.
Enthusiastic, but not much of a player.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 1929. Tennis players didn't make any money but they
traveled in the same circles as the wealthy and titled on the
French Riviera. Competing in tournaments to amuse patrons of the
best resorts, they got first-class room, board, and mingling
rights, and had to pack evening gowns or tuxedos in their steamer
trunks.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the deal was playing in handicap mixed doubles events
with such nabobs as 70-year-old King Gustav V of Sweden. Called
just plain Mr. G. by partners and opponents, he was a slim,
distinguished figure in white mustache and straw hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of his victims,'' Midge recalls, her eyes hazel and
jovial. ``I played with some Austrian, and the king had a German,
Cilly Aussem, who won Wimbledon a couple years later, as his
protector. She covered most of the court, and we kept it close.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, though the players are rich, elegance isn't on their
calendar, and most of them think the king of Sweden is named Volvo
or Saab, maybe Borg.
</P>
<P>
   As Midge Morrill, a Winsor School kid, she came out of Dedham,
Mass. to become one of the world's better players _ five times in
the US Top 10 between 1928 and 1934 _ and finds herself the last of
her crowd. The January death at 92 of her friend Helen Wills Moody
(a woman neither she nor anybody else could beat) leaves Midge as
the elder among the female Top 10 gang. ``I never got more than a
couple of games off Helen.''
</P>
<P>
   She was in good company. Moody rang up 27 titles (17 majors) and
a 158-match streak over a 14-year span before losing the 1933 US
singles final to Helen Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   Midge is sitting on the porch at Longwood Cricket Club in
Brookline, Mass. with her kid sister, Polly Sands, looking in two
directions. Backward and forward. At an interrogator's request, she
peers into the seldom-visited past, talking about the ``almost''
year, 1930, although the quote is from a New York Times story, not
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Twice widowed, she nevertheless prefers the good new to the good
old days, and ``the wonderful life I have with three children, 11
grandchildren, and 22 great-grandchildren. I wish today's players
the same kind of happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   An immediate thought is of the MFS Pro tourney next week at
Longwood and ``the hope I can get seats close to the ground so I
won't have much climbing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   She was applauded on that ground, then a grassy plot, many
times. The MFS is to be staged in the same arena, an enlarged
version, where Midge and the dark-haired Pat Rafterian male god of
the 1930s, Frank Shields, lost a US mixed doubles final to Edith
Cross and Wilmer Allison.
</P>
<P>
   Teaming with the dashing Shields (Brooke Shields's grandfather)
in 1930, ``I was the envy of every woman in Boston. Frank was mad
when we won the semis because the final cut in on a weekend he had
planned with a girl in Maine.''
</P>
<P>
   Another matinee idol by her side to the US semifinals of 1928
was the French boulevardier and two-time Wimbledon champ, Jean
Borotra. ``He wore a beret and was a great hand kisser.''
</P>
<P>
   A US singles quarterfinalist in 1927 and '32, Midge was a
sturdy, broad-shouldered 5 feet 8 inches in knee-length white dress
and brightly hued bandeau holding brunette tresses in place. She
might have hit the jackpot in '30 as she ``slugged'' her way to the
semis on the Forest Hills lawn with the ``demoralizing fury of a
withering forehand'' _ the words of the Times' Allison Danzig. She
rescued two set points in winning the first set, 8-6, and led
England's Betty Nuthall, 4-2, in the second.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sluggers' August like our own. Five men were ahead of
Babe Ruth's 1927 record pace of 60 homers: Ruth, who wound up with
49; teammate Lou Gehrig (41); Jimmie Foxx (37) of the
pennant-winning Philadelphia Athletics, Chuck Klein (40) of the
Phillies; and Hack Wilson (56) of the Cubs. Midge may have had as
much punch as Our Olde Towne Team's best, Earl Webb, who hit 16 for
the last-place Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember much about that match,'' she says, ``but I
think Betty got me with drop shots.'' Midge ``lost coordination in
a surprising lull so near to victory,'' Danzig wrote, losing, 6-8,
6-4, 6-2. Nuthall then dispatched Valerie Harper in 36 minutes to
win the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never given it much thought,'' says Midge. ``We just had
so much fun. Helen obviously took it very seriously. But most of us
didn't. We didn't train or practice much, just played. The stakes
weren't as high as today.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Miss Morrill ranked No. 2 behind Moody, who declined to
make the train trip from San Francisco to New York for the US
showdown, saying she'd traveled enough in winning the French and
Wimbledon. Winning five of 12 tournaments, Midge had the kind of
season that would be worth about a million present-day bucks, the
sum earned in 1997 by the current American No. 2, Monica Seles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. I'm not sure I'd want to have worked that hard.
We were amateurs with no financial aspirations, just looking for
fun. I fell in love with Whit Painter, the father of my three kids,
and that was the end of the tour for me. I stopped playing at 80
when the knees gave out, had a brief, happy marriage with John
Whiting.''
</P>
<P>
   She has outlasted a world in which she fit so well. Nobody
travels by ocean liner anymore, equipped with ballroom dresses and
rackets. A bygone haunt, Longwood's prime courts, are paved harder
than Kenneth Starr's heart. The grass and Riviera circuits that
meant so much are pressed into scrapbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stretching?'' She shakes her head in merriment. ``Didn't know
about that stuff, but we played, anyway.'' They prided themselves
on stretching a 1930 dollar into dinner, carfare, and a movie at a
time when you could stay on Atlantic City's then fashionable
Boardwalk in a seaside hotel room with three meals for $6.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the engaging Midge, who cast her first presidential ballot
for Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, has stretched into her 10th
decade very nicely.

QUIGLEY IS PASSING SENIOR TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just a year ago Dana Quigley won for the first time on the
Senior PGA Tour, beating Jay Sigel in a playoff on the third extra
hole at the Northville Long Island Classic. It was an afternoon in
which he experienced the full range of life's emotions. It was a
win that gave him a year's exemption, but when he was walking to
the interview tent he received a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   He said he'd take it later but was told he should talk to his
brother Paul immediately. The news was that their father, Wally,
had died of cancer that afternoon. ``I was told, `Your brother
wants to talk to you.''' Quigley recalled Wednesday on the eve of
his defense at Meadow Brook CC in Jericho, N.Y. ``I said, ```Tell
him I'll call him back. I'm going to talk to the press.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy said, `You'd better talk to him now.' Never once that
day did I think my father had died. I collapsed to the ground. I
just lay there for 10 or 15 minutes. Then I had to go to the press
room. No one knew about it. The first thing I said was about my
father dying. I was crying. The next half hour was tough. Everybody
was crying. It was so emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   Quigley, who grew up in Barrington, R.I., went to the University
of Rhode Island and had dominated New England PGA sectional play,
had turned 50 on April 14, 1997. He couldn't go to the Senior Tour
qualifying school until that fall so the only avenue to play was in
Monday qualifiers, something he did during the decade he played on
the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   The catch to playing the Senior Tour is you're only as good as
your last victory unless you enjoy the success of players such as
Tom Weiskopf, George Archer, Bruce Crampton, and Chi Chi Rodriguez
who are eligible for tournaments based on the career money list.
Quigley has played in 39 straight tournaments since the BankBoston
Classic a year ago at Nashawtuc CC when he received a sponsor's
exemption and finished tied for sixth. He still had to qualify
Monday in Jericho, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he hasn't missed an event and is 13th on the money
list with $620,00. This virtually guarantees him a free ride next
season , since the top 31 are exempt. ``It's been absolutely
fabulous,'' said Quigley, who will be in next week's BankBoston
Classic and doesn't plan to take any time off from the tour. ``It
beats the hell out of the Cummaquid pro-am. Who would have thunk
it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't so sure I'd be able to stay mentally positive. It's
more golf than I wanted to play, but more than the physical it's
the mental. I think that's the whole key. Certainly playing week
after week can get tiring, but it's the mind. You have to put the
`I can't' words out of your mind. I've played every one, 39 in a
row going into this week. I haven't even come close to taking a
week off. If I take a week off, I can drop down on the money
list.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two years ago, after winning the Wogan Award as the
NEPGA's top player for the seventh time in 12 years, Quigley
decided to test the Senior Tour waters. He knew it was a gamble,
but he felt it might be worth the risk if he somehow could make the
top 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just went over $1 million,'' Quigley said. ``For a guy like
me to make that type of money is something I'd never have expected.
If I make good, then I may take some time off but I still have a
little way to go before I make enough to be exempt. I'm physically
fit, so if I'm mentaly sharp I'll just keep playing for as long as
I can. I'm just having too much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Quigley, who had been director of golf at Crestwood CC in
Rehoboth, said his old NEPGA sidekick Paul Parajeckas, the pro at
Woburn CC, will be his caddie at Nashawtuc. ``He told me he was
going to go out and walk the course tomorrow,'' said Quigley. ``I
said, `For What?' I had my 11th top 10 last week. I'm playing
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Quigley will be the guest of honor at a dinner tonight in
Jericho, N.Y. ``We've got 35 people coming down,'' Quigley said.
The group will include his mother Dot. He said a victory next week
in Concord would be a special treat, but the Long Island Classic
will always have special meaning. ``I just shot a 69 in the
pro-am,'' Quigley said, ``and maybe the emotion of my father's
memory might carry me through it.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    WASHINGTON -- It is time for the American people to tell
President Clinton: ''Go. Resign or be impeached.''
 &HT;    Americans are asking hard questions now that Clinton has
acknowledged that he ''had a relationship with Miss Lewinsky that
was not appropriate.'' Only seven months ago, he defiantly told us,
''I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.''
 &HT;    Do we want to have as our president an incorrigible sexaholic?
He has been accused of making passes or carrying on full-fledged
affairs by Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, Monica
Lewinsky and others allegedly preparing their own law suits.
 &HT;    Do we want a chronic liar as president? This week Clinton
belatedly acknowledged that his ''public comments and my silence
about this matter gave a false impression. I misled people,
including even my wife.''
 &HT;    Indeed, in his very confession, he patently lied to us over and
over again.
 &HT;    Were his answers in a deposition in the Jones suit ''legally
accurate'' as he now claims, when he said in January, ''I have
never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky?''
 &HT;    Why did she visit him 37 times in the White House after she was
transferred to the Pentagon? She was not a member of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.
 &HT;    He has acknowledged to the grand jury that he had oral sex with
her. But, his lawyers assert that does not meet the definition of
sexual relations established by the judge of knowingly having
''contact with the genitals, anus, groin, breast inner thigh, or
buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the
sexual desire of any person.''
 &HT;    Oral sex clearly meets that definition.
 &HT;    He lied when he said, ''I was also very concerned about
protecting my family ... I intend to reclaim my family life for my
family.''
 &HT;    In a ''Wall Street Journal'' column, William Bennett writes:
''Let's be blunt. If Mr. Clinton genuinely cared about 'the two
people I love most -- my wife and our daughter,' he would not be
chronically unfaithful to them.
 &HT;    ''He would not have had oral sex with an intern barely older
than his daughter ... He would not betray his family's trust time
after time. He would not have sent forth his wife to defend him
with preposterous claims of a 'vast right-wing conspiracy.' Mr.
Clinton's real message is: I will betray my wife and daughter when
it's convenient and I will hide behind them when it's necessary.
And then I will do it all over again.''
 &HT;    The author of a powerful new book, ''The Death of Outrage: Bill
Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals,'' Bennett called the
president's four-minute address to the American people ''the most
deceptive, shameless and self-pitying speech ever delivered by an
American president.''
 &HT;    Clinton outrageously attacked Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr's
investigation as having ''gone on too long, cost too much and hurt
too many people.''
 &HT;    This is transparently deceitful.
 &HT;    If the president had made Monday night's speech last January, he
would have shortened the investigation by seven months. It was
Clinton who refused to testify to the grand jury six times until he
was sent a subpoena.
 &HT;    It was Clinton who claimed a non-existent ''executive
privilege'' to keep the Secret Service and aides from testifying,
and took their case to the Supreme Court.
 &HT;    It was Clinton who forced his staff to spend hundreds of
thousands of their own dollars in legal fees to defend his
scabrous, sickening sexual obsession before the grand jury.
 &HT;    Do we want as president, the nation's highest law enforcement
officer, a man who committed perjury and who apparently encouraged
Lewinsky to lie? She says he helped her develop ''cover stories''
to disguise their affair, and suggested hypothetical ways to avoid
turning over presidential gifts to Jones' lawyers. If so, he
committed the crime of suborning perjury.
 &HT;    Do we want as president a man who offers bribes to silence a
witness? Clinton even asked then U.N. Ambassador Bill Richardson to
hire Monica Lewinsky, and the job was offered.
 &HT;    Do we want as president a man whose message to young people is
commit adultery on Saturday night and wave a Bible as you walk to
church holding hands with your wife on Sunday.
 &HT;    The president tells us it is time ''to turn away from the
spectacle of the past seven months, to repair the fabric of our
national disgrace.''
 &HT;    Sadly, only he has the power to do that by resigning.

   CLINTON-MAIN _ WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky went back to the
federal courthouse Thursday for more testimony amid indications
independent counsel Kenneth Starr plans to ask others to return.
Meanwhile, prosecutors collected samples of President Clinton's

in Arkansas and Kentucky and struggling to defend incumbents in
North Carolina (Republican Sen. Lauch Faircloth) and South Carolina

`STRIKE!' TRIES TO PACK IN TOO MUCH IN ONE MOVIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Strike!'' brings to mind the 1966 film, ``The Trouble With
Angels,'' which featured rebellious convent school students, played
by Hayley Mills and June Harding, pitted against Rosalind Russell's
stern but kindly Mother Superior.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it's Miss Godard's Prep School for Girls and there
are five fiery young women _ not just two _ struggling with the
perils of coming-of-age in an idealistic 1963.
</P>
<P>
   It's a new era and women's roles are changing. Miss Godard's,
for all its convention, is teaching its pupils to be
forward-thinking and brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   Odie (Gaby Hoffmann) is the story's narrator. She's smart,
offbeat and pushing hard to lose her virginity. Verena (Kirsten
Dunst) has the Hayley Mills role and is an outspoken prankster who
retains a fierce loyalty to the school. Tinka (Monica Keena) is a
flirty seductress, while Tweety (Heather Matarazzo) suffers from an
eating disorder. Momo (Merritt Wever) is the scientific genius who
launches the ultimate plan to keep the school from being forced to
go coed because of impending financial disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Looking over this wayward brood of girls with authority and
fondness is the eccentric, individualistic headmistress, Miss
McVane (Lynn Redgrave). She is distraught over the merger, worried
her girls' interests will be pushed aside and they'll become second
class citizens once boys arrive on campus. Leave it to Verena and
Odie to plan a radical revolt that might just keep the school safe
from male dominance and give the girls a newfound sense of self
worth.
</P>
<P>
   Writer and director Sarah Kernochan drew her characters directly
from her own New England boarding school experiences. The result is
a wildly uneven movie that suffers from mood swings and
insufferably precious lines like, ``Up your ziggy with a wah-wah
brush.'' Obviously, Kernochan had difficulty keeping an objective
point-of-view about her personal memories, which are really only
adorable to her and don't necessarily make good movie material.
</P>
<P>
   While it's an intriguing idea to focus on adolescent girls in a
comedic way after recent movies like ``Whatever'' and ``All Over
Me'' emphasized the scary, serious side of teenage life,
``Strike!'' bites off more than it can chew.
</P>
<P>
   It wants to be funny, fervent, feminist and socially savvy about
girl's problems with self-image, boys, breasts, sex and parents,
and there's a subplot about anorexia and bulemia tossed in for good
measure. But while it has lots of energy, there's enough stuff in
the script for two movies. By the time the film winds down, it
feels much longer than its 96 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Strike! Directed and written by Sarah Kernochan. Cast: Kirsten
Dunst, Gaby Hoffmann, Monica Keena, Lynn Redgrave. Miramax Films.
96 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sexual themes and partial nudity.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C

19-year-old girl who was to give birth to sextuplets in the coastal
Caribbean city of Barranquilla.
</P>
<P>
   They had followed her pregnancy _ publishing an array of stories
about the size of her belly, her boyfriend's reaction, even medical
explanations from her doctors.
</P>
<P>
   What no journalist discovered, after weeks of being around her,
was that her tummy was huge not because she was about to produce
six babies but because she had tied pounds of rags around her. She
wanted her boyfriend to propose marriage.
</P>
<P>
   When the story broke, Nobel-laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez,
novelist and journalist, was there teaching a workshop on reportage
_ part of the Foundation for New Iberoamerican Journalism, ``a
school without walls'' he fathered in 1995 out of his preoccupation
with the state of journalism in the region.
</P>
<P>
   He believes the computer era, the tape recorder and the lack of
rapport between reporter and editor has turned journalists into
cold communicators and simple transmitters of press releases and
transcribers of taped interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Journalism, which Garcia Marquez calls ``the best profession in
the world,'' is ailing. He is so concerned that we journalists have
forgotten how to tell a good story that he is willing to spend time
teaching us how he writes them.
</P>
<P>
   In the workshops, he admonishes those who prefer getting the
breaking story rather than preparing a good story, those who are
more concerned about reaching the halls of power and not the hearts
of readers. As much as Liliana's smart tactics made for an amusing
anecdote, her ability to deceive the nation's media prove Garcia
Marquez right: We are not doing our job.
</P>
<P>
   It also served him as a great teaching tool. Recognizing that
the story had all the elements of a great piece of reportage, the
maestro invited the prankster to class and asked the dozen
participants, young professional journalists, to interview her.
</P>
<P>
   Their assignment was to write Liliana's story _ not just by
pulling quotes from the infamous, ever-present tape recorder _ but
by following the principle that print journalism is a literary
form.
</P>
<P>
   Although this is not in itself a revelation, Garcia Marquez's
commitment to bring such a belief back to the newsroom is a
difficult and commendable effort. Because he is convinced that
there are no theories to be learned in journalism _ that the best
way to teach is to gather cub reporters and have them listen to the
experience of the veterans _ the Foundation brings them together in
an informal setting of workshops and seminars.
</P>
<P>
   It is based in Cartagena, Colombia, because that is the home of
El Universal, the first newspaper that Garcia Marquez wrote for;
and it is also the home of Clemente Manuel Zavala, the man whose
red pencil scratched and scribbled over his first articles _ the
type of editor, he believes, Latin American newspapers lack. Garcia
Marquez wants to bring his old editor back to life so much that, at
the Foundation's headquarters, one of the conference rooms is named
after him.
</P>
<P>
   Because its Nobel founder believes in Bolivar's dream of Latin
American unity, the Foundation organizes events throughout the
region. People have been taught not only in Cartagena but in other
Colombian cities and in Madrid, Mexico, Buenos Aires, Quito,
Guayaquil and Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   In three years, 600 journalists have been able to discuss
narrative techniques, current events and questions of professional
ethics face to face with the best Spanish-speaking non-fiction
writers of today. To have Garcia Marquez, Tomas Eloy Martinez or
Alma Guillermo Prieto give tips about how to write a piece of
reportage is like getting Keith Richards to show a starting
musician chords on his guitar.
</P>
<P>
   At one of the workshops Garcia Marquez taught in Cartagena _ he
has conducted 10 of the 50 events _ he acted as newsroom editor and
took on a real investigation about a young Italian tourist who had
died after having being arrested by the police. At another one in
Mexico, to teach students how to write description, he took the
class to sit in while a sketcher for the Mexican police was given
the details of the suspected criminal. Based on what they heard,
students had to write a profile.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Anderson has spoken about reporting under fire. Colombian
priest-turned-reporter Javier Dario Restrepo talks about the
difficulties of being a journalist in a country at war. Horacio
Verbitsky and Pulitzer Prize-winner Tim Golden taught investigative
journalism. Carlos Monsivais, Mexico's leading opinion journalist,
will discuss his columns while Sergio Munoz, a member of The Los
Angeles Times' editorial board, will explain how to write
straightforward op-ed pieces, devoid of the obscure and complicated
phrasing that characterizes Latin America's editorial writers.
</P>
<P>
   For photojournalists, Magnum photographer Susan Meiselas shares
her slides from the civil wars of Central America, showing how
photographers are also storytellers _ not just the appendage of the
writer. Free-lance photojournalist Stephen Ferry, who applauds
Garcia Marquez's concern that most journalism is being done in
press conferences and not on the street, sees the Foundation as his
chance to do subversive work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want photographers to rebel against their editors,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Photographers come in asking him technical questions such as how
to prevent a flash from bouncing off a speakers's face. He answers
by telling them to leave the press conference _ press conferences
don't tell stories.
</P>
<P>
   With the Foundation's efforts and the team of professionals
involved in teaching Spanish-speaking reporters, the future of
journalism in the region is promising. Hopefully, episodes like
Liliana's will not create an embarrassing moment for the entire
media of a region but an opportunity to write the fantastic story
her imagination deserved.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When guests come to Laurie Burrows Grad's house
these days, she doesn't load them up on fat and calories. Instead
she opts for cooking light _ and easy _ which has become a way of
life for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's healthful and keeps me slim,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Those killer recipes that we've all served company over the
years have vanished from her repertoire. ``You don't have to use
butter and cream to create beautiful parties,'' emphasized Grad.
</P>
<P>
   Now she relies on tempting creations that use lower-fat and
lower-calorie alternatives and take advantage of fat-reducing
cooking methods when she entertains. And she says her company is
grateful.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find the particulars of how she does it in her latest
cookbook, ``Entertaining Light &AMP; Easy, Lower-Fat Recipes for
Festive Meals'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster; $25), including recipes for a
variety of occasions _ from festive brunches and holiday parties to
elegant dinners and casual feasts. ``The book is all about dining
pleasurably _ entertaining with a conscience and eating without
fear,'' said Grad, adding that moderation is the key.
</P>
<P>
   ``Light does not mean eating diet food or fat-free cakes _ or
depriving yourself of flavor,'' she noted recently at her Los
Angeles home. But light does mean taking advantage of the
California lifestyle. And that means using lots of fresh seasonal
produce, grilling outdoors (her husband, Peter, a screenwriter, is
the expert here) or indoors, steaming vegetables and poaching foods
without added fats. She also uses fruit and vegetable salsas rather
than heavy, rich sauces on meats, poultry and fish. In addition,
she relies on the natural taste of herbs, produce, meat, fish and
poultry to enhance a dish without added fat. Asian condiments and
flavorings _ items like chili paste with garlic, hoisin sauce,
sesame oil and Cinkiang rice vinegar _ are favored in Grad's
cooking (in marinades, salad dressings and noodle dishes, for
instance) because they add intense flavor without a lot of fat.
</P>
<P>
   To keep fit, she prefers eating fresh food that is generally
lower in fat than processed foods. Fresh salads, light sandwiches
or grilled meals have become her regular choices, replacing
fat-laden options, she noted. But Grad also believes in exercising
_ and she walks 3 1/2 miles daily with a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Grad, who was born in Los Angeles, but grew up in New York,
hails from a family of good cooks. ``Both of my parents were very
good cooks and my mother entertained at large parties. She was very
creative _ curry dishes and bouillabaise were among her
favorites.'' Her father, the late playwright/director Abe Burrows,
cooked when he was in writer's block, she noted.
</P>
<P>
   So cooking came naturally for Grad, who has written three other
cookbooks as well as hosted a cable television cooking show.
</P>
<P>
   Grad believes that regardless of the reduction of fat and
calories, the end results must taste good _ in fact so good that
guests won't notice or can't believe the dishes are low-fat.
Appealing presentation is important, too, she added, suggesting you
garnish and decorate finished creations with a slice of citrus
fruit, a few sprigs of a fresh herb, a cherry tomato or an edible
flower _ all the while paying attention to color.
</P>
<P>
   Setting a beautiful table is key as well. ``It doesn't have to
be complicated to be a knockout,'' noted Grad, who admits to not
being great with flowers. ``Use some colorful ribbon to tie up
napkins. Buy some inexpensive bud vases, fill each with tulips or
whatever is in season and baby's breath and place one at each
setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Grad prefers inviting eight to 10 people to her dinner parties _
and 20 for a barbecue. Her rationale is simple: ``I don't like to
kill myself for four people,'' she said. ``It's the same amount of
work for four or 10.''
</P>
<P>
   In summer, when she entertains a couple of times or more per
month, she likes to serve crudites such as baby carrots and cherry
tomatoes, smoked salmon tartare, Sweet Pea Guacamole, grilled tuna,
chicken fajitas or butterflied leg of lamb, roasted corn and cold
soups like Cucumber Yogurt Soup with Fresh Mint or a cold zucchini
soup. Other times, she might pair a cold soup with chicken salad
and fruit and cookies for dessert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also love to do salsas on grilled fish or chicken or grilled
fish with Roasted Garlic Sauce,'' she continued. The garlic sauce _
made with baked garlic, nonfat yogurt, reduced fat mayonnaise and
grainy Dijon mustard _ can be prepared a day or two in advance of
serving and kept refrigerated.
</P>
<P>
   Grad also likes to put together salads that are seasonal and
fresh.
</P>
<P>
   If there's no time to make an appetizer, pick up flavored smoked
salmon and serve with a quick sauce mixed up with yogurt, dill,
lemon juice and mustard accompanied with pumpernickel rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Because the book touts light-style dining, it's a bit surprising
that the recipes don't include calorie or fat counts or any other
nutritional analysis. Grad asks cooks to trust that the recipes are
low in fat, low in calories and low in sodium, but that may not
appease cooks and diners who are interested in specific figures or
are on special or restricted diets.
</P>
<P>
   Grad believes that this, her fourth cookbook, is the freshest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in cookbook burnout for five years,'' she noted, ``and
then I decided I wanted to share a battery of new recipes.'' This
new volume is the outgrowth of that.
</P>
<P>
   Grad has designed a summer luncheon party that would be ideal
for a bridal or baby shower or other occasions with ideas from her
book. It's easy to orchestrate the production if you plan and do
most of the cooking in advance (recipes in the book include
do-ahead prep tips). Dress up the recipes with a lovely
presentation _ either on beautiful dishes or with festive garnishes
and get ready for the kudos. &QL;

SWEET PEA GUACAMOLE
</P>
<P>
   Michael Roberts, former chef at Trumps in Los Angeles,
popularized the concept of using peas in guacamole. He suggests
using the frozen peas because the color is more vibrant and the
sugarin the peas has not been allowed to turn to starch.
</P>
<P>
   2 packages (10 ounces EACH) frozen peas, thawed
</P>
<P>
   1/4 medium ripe avocado, peeled, pitted and roughly chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons defatted chicken OR vegetable broth
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons low-fat mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons roughly chopped cilantro
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons jalapeno chile, seeded and roughly chopped (see
Note)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground chile powder
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons EACH chopped tomatoes and green onions for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Baked tortilla chips OR low-fat tortilla chips
</P>
<P>
   In a food processor or blender, combine all ingredients except
tomatoes, green onions and chips, and process until just smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Place in a serving bowl, garnish with tomatoes and green onions.
Serve accompanied with tortilla chips.
</P>
<P>
   Since there is avocado in dip, which tends to discolor, it is
best to serve immediately, but can be kept a few hours in
refrigerator. Makes 3 cups.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: About 89 percent of a chile's fire is contained in the
ribs. If these ribs and attached seeds are cut off and discarded,
the heat is diminished. In handling chiles, it is a good idea to
wear thin rubber gloves; if you do touch a chile with your bare
hands, be sure not to touch your eyes or mouth until you have
washed your hands with soap and water and allowed a few hours to
elapse.
</P>
<P>
   VARIATION: For a lower-fat version, avocado can be omitted. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ROASTED VEGETABLE SPREAD
</P>
<P>
   Other vegetables can be substituted or added to this spread such
as red or yellow bell peppers, shallots, zucchini and for added
spice a jalapeno chile. The spread can also be tossed with linguine
or spaghetti for a delicious pasta dish or spread on pizza crust
and baked until hot and bubbly.
</P>
<P>
   1 medium eggplant (about 1 pound), quartered lengthwise (see
Note)
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, thickly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds tomatoes, sliced horizontally and squeezed of seeds
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves garlic, unpeeled
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil plus additional fresh basil
leaves for garnish
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Toasted thin sliced bread
</P>
<P>
   Lightly coat a roasting pan with olive oil nonstick cooking
spray.
</P>
<P>
   Place eggplant, skin side down, in pan; add onion, tomatoes and
garlic. Spray vegetables lightly with oil.
</P>
<P>
   Roast in preheated 425-degree oven 45 to 50 minutes or until
vegetables are softened and browned. Allow to cool slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Place eggplant, onion and tomatoes (not garlic) in a food
processor or blender and process until just smooth. Squeeze garlic
puree out of skin into food processor, add chopped basil, vinegar
and salt and pepper. Continue to puree until smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Serve spread hot, at room temperature or even cold on toasted
thin-sliced bread garnished with basil leaves. Spread may be
prepared up to 3 days in advance and chilled until ready to serve.
Makes 8 to 10 servings.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: The younger the eggplant, the fewer seeds and the less
bitter the flesh. To select a young vegetable, choose an eggplant
that is rich purple in color with a firm flesh. Medium-sized
eggplants are preferred since larger ones tend to have more seeds.
The cap should look fresh and green and avoid any eggplants with
dark brown spots, a sure sign of decay.
</P>
<P>
   It is not necessary to peel eggplant or tomato since skins will
soften considerably. If desired, remove skins easily after roasting
and before pureeing spread.
</P>
<P>
   One pound of Japanese eggplants can be substituted for 1 medium
eggplant. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;

<P>
   LIGHT ORANGE POPPY SEED POUNDCAKE
</P>
<P>
   You will need a nonstick 10-inch tube pan to make this cake.
It's a sort of angel food/poundcake combo made moist by nonfat sour
cream, lightened by beaten whites, but with the texture of a rich
poundcake. It is not a complicated recipe but does require a lot of
bowls and dishes to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   CAKE:
</P>
<P>
   6 egg whites, at room temperature for 15 minutes before using
</P>
<P>
   2 cups granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 carton (16 ounces) nonfat sour cream
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup frozen orange juice concentrate
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup poppy seeds
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons grated orange peel
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup vegetable oil

electric mixer until just frothy. Gradually add 1/2 cup granulated
sugar, beating until soft peaks form.
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl, combine sour cream with orange juice
concentrate, poppy seeds, orange peel and vanilla. Whisk until
mixture is smooth.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate medium bowl, beat remaining 1 1/2 cups granulated
sugar with oil until lightly combined. Add whole eggs and beat
until well mixed. Add sour cream mixture and continue to beat until
smooth.
</P>

rack to cool thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   While cake is cooling, prepare Glaze by mixing powdered sugar
with orange juice and peel and continue beating until smooth. When
cake is slightly cooled, prick holes lightly with a fork and pour
glaze over cake.
</P>
<P>
   Allow cake to cool slightly, slice and serve warm or at room
temperature, topped with a dollop of nonfat or low-fat vanilla or
lemon frozen yogurt or low-fat vanilla ice cream. Makes 1 large

before juicing. If lemons are stored in refrigerator, microwave 10
to 20 seconds or leave in hot water several minutes before
juicing. &QL;

KEEPING IT LIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Following are some of cookbook author Laurie
Burrows Grad's additional tricks for cooking light and easy
anytime.
</P>
<P>
   _Use fresh lemon juice instead of bottled. Squeeze fresh lemons
when plentiful and keep a supply of juice in the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   _Limit the amount of oil used. Fill spray pumps with olive or
canola oil and use to spray pans. You'll save money. Keep in mind
that light olive oil is not lower in fat _ it just has some of the
oil's flavor and color removed.
</P>
<P>
   _Slowly roasted garlic is an excellent fat-free ``butter''
alternative that can be used as a spread on bread or to flavor
sauces or mashed potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   _Use canned broths, refrigerated prepared salsas, canned
tomatoes, store-bought peeled garlic and curry powder as
timesavers.
</P>
<P>
   _Use heavy, nonstick pans. Grad's personal choice is All-Clad,
LTD. A less expensive alternative is Farberware Millennium pans,
she notes.
</P>
<P>
   _Yogurt cheese is a good base for dips and salad dressings in
place of mayonnaise or sour cream.
</P>
<P>
   _Dip meats, fish or poultry into butter or egg white rather than
whole egg when coating with crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   _Lean ground turkey is a good substitute for ground beef in
meatloaves, burgers, chilis and other dishes.
</P>
<P>
   _Cooked and pureed vegetables are good natural thickeners in
place of butter, flour and cream in soups and sauces.
</P>
<P>
   _Grill meats (to remove fat) rather than sauteing before putting
in stews and braised dishes, advised Grad. In osso buco, for
instance, she grills the veal before braising to eliminate fat.
</P>
<P>
   _To intensify flavor, toast nuts and seeds; they'll add more
flavor to finished dishes than plain ones, so you'll end up using
less.
</P>
<P>
   _Cook in paper or foil packets; added fats are not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   _Use nonfat or 1 percent low-fat milk _ which are lower in
saturated fat, cholesterol and calories than whole milk. You can
give nonfat milk more body by adding a spoonful of powdered milk.
</P>
<P>
   _Use low-fat or reduced-fat cheeses. Avoid nonfat cheeses, which
are rubbery. Also avoid nonfat cream cheese, which is gross, noted
Grad.
</P>
<P>
   _Mustard, especially the grainy variety, is good for adding
thickness to dressings and sauces without added fat.
</P>
<P>
   _Discard fat on chicken after cooking and before eating.
</P>
<P>
   _To reduce fat in recipes, substitute egg whites for whole eggs
_ 1 1/2 to 2 egg whites for each yolk.
</P>
<P>
   _Keep in mind you'll need a little bit of fat in baked goods for
taste and texture. Although Grad advocates using low-fat rather
than nonfat sour cream in most cases, she makes an exception and
uses nonfat sour cream in cakes for moistness.
</P>
<P>
   _When a recipe calls for cream or milk, use chicken or vegetable
broth and a few cooked, pureed potatoes or rice for thickening.
</P>
<P>
   _Use small amounts of prosciutto or Canadian bacon to add smoky
flavor to dishes.
</P>
<P>
   _Use a gravy or fat strainer to separate fats and oils from
soups, sauces and stews when there is no time for overnight
chilling. This is one of Grad's favorite light gadgets. She also
likes a yogurt cheese maker.
</P>
<P>
   _Top fruit desserts, cakes, etc., with a dollop of nonfat
vanilla yogurt or frozen yogurt rather than whipped cream or ice
cream. &QL;

GE SAYS EPA REPORT ON HUDSON RIVER POLLUTION IS FLAWED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLONIE, N.Y. _ An Environmental Protection Agency report that
found PCBs were escaping from polluted Hudson River sediment is so
flawed that its conclusions cannot be taken seriously, the General
Electric Co. has charged.
</P>
<P>
   GE accused the environmental agency of selectively excluding
data, bumbling key statistics and jumping to rash conclusions about
the amount and location of PCBs leaving the Hudson's sediment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report contains errors so serious and so fundamental that
GE believes the conclusions invalid,'' Mel Schweiger, manager of
GE's Hudson River PCB assessment team, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The contradictory claims from GE and the federal government
center on the EPA's conclusion last month that silt-bound PCBs were
not staying buried by layers of clean sediment. Rather, the federal
agency's report said the industrial chemicals were escaping into
the water from patches of sediment where they are highly
concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA report, based on samples taken in 1984 and 1994,
contradicted GE's long-standing claim that PCBs were being buried
deep enough to seal them off from marine life or were naturally
breaking down into harmless substances.
</P>
<P>
   GE used PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, for about three
decades as an insulator in electric capacitors. The company legally
discharged more than one million pounds of the chemicals from
factories in two New York towns, Hudson Falls and Fort Edward, into
the river before the chemicals were banned in 1976. GE says it has
spent $150 million to remove some of PCBs it discharged and could
be forced to pay the potentially huge cost of dredging them from
the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA has set a June 2001 date for making a final decision
about what to do about the PCB pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government considers PCBs toxic to humans. In April,
GE Chairman Jack Welch told stockholders that PCBs have no adverse
health effects.
</P>
<P>
   GE's dismissal of the EPA's study, announced at a news
conference Wednesday, is based on the company's own study of cores
of Hudson River sediment, completed in June. The report picked
apart the EPA's main conclusion and offered GE's own explanations
of where the agency went wrong. For example, GE criticized as
invalid EPA's reliance on only 60 sediment samples to estimate PCB
releases for the entire six-mile stretch of the Thompson Island
Pool, a ``hot spot,'' or known area of high PCB concentration,
south of Fort Edward.
</P>
<P>
   GE also said the EPA's analysis of Hudson River core samples was
far too crude to offer conclusions about how encased the
sediment-bound PCBs are.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just isn't enough data to analyze anything with any
accuracy,'' said John Connolly, a GE consultant and president of
Quantitative Environmental Analysis of Montvale, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Presented with the accusations in General Electric's report, EPA
spokesman Dick Stapleton said, ``We stand by our findings. PCBs are
not being covered by clean sediments and there have been
significant releases from hot spots into the river.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about GE's dismantling of the EPA methodology, he said,
``We have good scientists.''
</P>
<P>
   GE's detailed riposte to each new EPA finding highlights the
high-stakes battle in which neither side will acknowledge the
other's scientific findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``So high are the stakes on the Hudson River that the science
that supports EPA's conclusions must be of impeccable quality,''
Schweiger said.

   FILM-GADJO (Undated) The title character of Tony Gatlif's latest
_ and most enjoyable _ examination of Gypsy life, ``Gadjo Dilo''
(Crazy Foreigner), is a determined young Parisian (Romain Duris)
who, as the film opens, is trudging across the frozen outback of
Romania on a personal quest.
</P>
<P>
   By William Arnold. (story will move in the ``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REGENERATION (Undated) The setting of Gillies Mackinnon's
well-meaning but terminally dreary period drama, ``Regeneration,''
is a cozy asylum in Scotland where British military doctors treat
shell-shocked World War I soldiers so they can be sent back to the
trenches of France.
</P>
<P>
   By William Arnold. (story will move in the ``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-HANDS (Undated) The documentary ``Hands on a Hard Body''
deals with such an obscure subject _ a contest sponsored by a
smalltown Texas auto-dealer _ that it's probably going to have a
hard time gathering a great deal of initial audience interest.
</P>
<P>
   By William Arnold. (story will move in the ``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-BLADE (Undated) ``Blade,'' gives the vampire thriller
formula some new life by playing it as epic _ in fact, as
apocalyptic epic. In this film, it's the vampires that run the
world, and the underdog humans who have to try and take it back.
</P>
<P>
   By William Arnold. (story will move in the ``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-FRIENDS (Undated) Neil LaBute's second feature, ``Your
Friends and Neighbors,'' is sure to both infuriate (at the preview
screening, three people walked out proclaiming, ``These people are
losers!'') and fascinate.
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (story will move in the ``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-STRIKE (Undated) ``Strike!'' brings to mind the 1966 film,
``The Trouble With Angels,'' which featured rebellious convent
school students, played by Hayley Mills and June Harding, pitted
against Rosalind Russell's stern but kindly Mother Superior.
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (story will move in the ``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-DANCE (Undated) ``A story of hearts in motion'' reads the

thing about it.
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (story will move in the ``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-DEAD (Undated) Poor Tom Everett Scott. After an impressive
debut in the Tom Hanks movie, ``That Thing You Do,'' the actor has
slowly seen his career take a downward spiral. First it was ``An
American Werewolf In Paris,'' now this odious and tasteless trifle.
Even the opening credits are morose and crass in ``Dead Man On
Campus,'' with various methods of suicide integrated into the cast
and crew's names.

   ``Just Because I'm Latin Doesn't Mean I Mambo: A Success Guide
for Hispanic Americans''
</P>
<P>
   By Juan Roberto Job
</P>
<P>
   Ballantine Publishing Group
</P>
<P>
   $22.95, 241 pages
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   One of the nation's biggest minorities is getting ready to flex
its economic muscles in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic community is ``where the action is,'' according to
author and speaker Juan Roberto Job.
</P>
<P>
   And their numbers are starting to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics are the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population
and are projected to become the largest minority in 2005. By 2050,
one out of four Americans will be Hispanic, outnumbering all other
minorities combined.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers translate into more dollars for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics annually buy $190 billion in goods and services
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that economic influence, corporate America is still
reluctant to embrace this emerging market, Job says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although mainstream America is starting to acknowledge the
importance of the Latino community, we are not easy to categorize
or understand,'' Job said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Latinos come in all shapes and sizes, from lots of
different backgrounds. We have many things in common but are
extremely diverse.''
</P>
<P>
   That richness and diversity of culture can be difficult to
market to, Job writes. It can also go against the conservative,
traditional grain of corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   Even though companies such as Sears, Coca-Cola and Office Depot
have had Hispanics in top executive positions, only 249 Hispanics
executives are at the level of vice president or above out of the
Fortune 1,000 companies last year.
</P>
<P>
   And although there are 2 million Hispanics with college degrees
in this country, the national Glass Ceiling Commission found that
most chief executives of major corporations think that only a few
Hispanics are eligible for top executive positions, Job writes.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare the Hispanic community for the opportunities and
requirements of corporate America, Job has written ``Just Because
I'm Latin Doesn't Mean I Mambo: A Success Guide for Hispanic
Americans'' (Ballentine Publishing Group, New York, 241 pages,
$22.95) The book offers a frank discussion on what it takes to
succeed in corporate America and offers practical advice on
overcoming the stereotypes that may stand in the way of getting
there.
</P>
<P>
   Many Hispanics will be entering unknown territory as they embark
on a corporate career, Job writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Latinos grow up in environments removed from the world of
business. Our fathers might be civil-service workers or mechanics.
Our mothers might be teachers or full-time homemakers,'' he writes.
``We have to learn about corporate America from observing and
listening to others.'' The key is adapting to the new environment,
Job suggests. And that may mean changing ingrained habits and
behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Hispanics are traditionally a modest group, Job
says, yet self-promotion is vital to a successful corporate career.
Extended family ties are also traditional to most Hispanics, yet
corporate careers can mean long hours at the office and extensive
travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cultural paradigms of corporate America tend to reflect
the Anglo-Saxon model,'' Job writes. ``As a result, Latinos who
want to pursue a business career often face tough personal choices
about values.'' Ultimately, everyone must decide on his or her own
priorities and ability or willingness to compromise, Job writes.
</P>
<P>
   This books discusses other issues relating to corporate life,
including education, unwritten rules and codes, career advancement
strategies and mentoring. A list of Hispanic professional
organizations and employee associations is provided in the back.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous stories and quotes by Hispanics in the business world
help bring this book to life.

A CONFIDENT WESLEY SNIPES CUTS LIKE A KNIFE IN `BLADE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although it's about 20 minutes too long, the action-horror movie
``Blade'' is a rousing tease _ it's smarter than it has a right to
be. It opens with the birth of its title character 31 years ago,
and then jumps into the present.
</P>
<P>
   An unsuspecting human is dragged by a beautiful girl into a
bumping club hidden beneath a meat locker. When the music at the
joint hits its climax, the shower spigots open and spray the room
with blood. It's full of vampires, and the hapless human is bounced
around like a meal in Levis.
</P>
<P>
   Blade (Wesley Snipes) appears, and a lurid, amped battle is
joined _ he spins through the crowd of bloodsuckers with his
samurai sword and automatic weapons loaded with
silver-garlic-tipped hollow-points.
</P>
<P>
   This spectacularly insane scene is just the antidote for horror
movie fans who are tired of seeing beautiful 15-year-olds stalked
by knife-wielding maniacs. When it works, ``Blade'' has a baroque,
wicked wit. The opening sequence sets a high-water mark, if you'll
pardon the pun.
</P>
<P>
   Snipes drops his voice an octave into an action-hero baritone,
although this tactic doesn't entirely rob him of expressiveness. He
is capable of being shocked, and he retains his sense of humor so
he can play the shocks for laughs _ an asset that eludes most
superstuds embroidered with muscles. He moves well, spinning and
kicking like a savior who has spent much time worshipping at the
shrine of Hong Kong avatars Jackie Chan and Jet Li. (It helps that
the vampires are as dim-witted as the villains in the Hong Kong
action stuff. Here, they mostly attack the hero one at a time _ if
these guys ever learn gang warfare, civilization as we know it is
over.)
</P>
<P>
   Blade's pregnant mother was bitten by a vamp before he was born,
and his mission is to take his elm-tree-sized Afro and bandoleer
loaded with wooden blades to do in the creature that bit her.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his unique status, Blade can go out into daylight and
has a vampire's strength, but he also needs blood. Whistler (Kris
Kristofferson), Blade's mentor and weapons master, has an even more
gravel-ridden voice than his protege. The anti-vampire team gets a
new partner, Karen (N'Bushe Wright), a hematologist who was bitten
and is trying to fight off vampirism.
</P>
<P>
   Director Stephen Norrington fashions a tense, moody ambience,
and the script piles on alert, genre cleverness. The problems come
because the movie doesn't exactly follow its own logic. When Frost
discovers a set of symbols that could turn the entire world into
vampires, it doesn't seem to occur to him that there will be no
food left if he succeeds. ``Blade'' doesn't have the low-camp
soap-opera zest of the WB's ``Buffy,'' although the kung-fu grip
battle scenes are definitely reminiscent. It's often genuinely
creepy, which gives it a gruesome resonance missing from most of
the new wave of horror movies.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Blade'' didn't drag on so long, it would be a great
B-movie. Instead, Snipes carries a lot of ``Blade'' on his
muscular, broad back. He's one of the few action stars with a
personality, and he can act. Recently, he has gone through a slew
of bad movies, and you can almost hear the audience sigh with
relief that he has chosen a worthwhile project. Ironically, he had
to do a vampire movie to show some taste.

`DANCE WITH ME' HAS TWO LEFT FEET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not at all light on its feet, ``Dance With Me'' stumbles
clumsily onto the cinema dance floor, one already crowded with
hackneyed hoofer pictures.
</P>
<P>
   You can almost hear some studio pitch-monkey saying, ``Hey,
Latin dancing is hot now, right? Why not make a movie about a poor
Cuban Pete who cha-chas his way into the hearts of America? It'll
be like a salsa-style `Strictly Ballroom.' '' Yeah, except without
all the entertainment value.
</P>
<P>
   It's puzzling why studios even bother cranking out dance
pictures anymore. When they work, as did ``Ballroom, Shall We
Dance?'' and ``Dirty Dancing,'' success can be moderate to decent.
But when they misstep _ ``The Forbidden Dance, Staying Alive'' or
``Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo'' _ the fallout usually has the
half-life of uranium 238. Kevin Bacon is still trying to shake off
``Footloose'' jokes, and that was a successful dance picture.
</P>
<P>
   Latin American singing sensation Chayanne hopes to Swayze his
way to screen success as Rafael, a young Cuban dreamer who comes to
Texas in search of the love of his late mother's, er, life. Kris
Kristofferson is a grizzled Houston dance studio manager who feels
for the boy enough to let him live over his garage and squeegee the
mirrors at the studio. You know, of course, that the studio manager
and Rafael share a big secret. Never mind that you figured it out
in the first 10 minutes _ this story is about as by-the-numbers as
a set of painted footprints on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Kristofferson's studio is populated by a handful of bored
neighborhood locals, as well as Vanessa L. Williams, the former
Miss America whose ravishing beauty seems ridiculously out of place
in this Dolly Dinkle dance dive. She left her life as a champion
dancer because her husband/partner is an egomaniacal jerk. Now she
does the dance teacher-by-day/single mother-by-night gig when she's
not beguiling the lovestruck Rafael, who manages to reignite her
passion for dance. (Think ``Stella Gets Her Mambo Back.)''
</P>
<P>
   There's not much point in summing up any more. Suffice it to say
there's a bitter breakup, a father/son scrap, a seemingly endless
Vegas dance contest, a touching reunion and the triumph of true
love in the end. Cliche, party of ... oh, too many to count.
</P>
<P>
   The film is not completely without charm. Chayanne is engaging,
with a smile that will melt hearts and a body that will wag
tongues. Williams proves herself to be quite a dancer, particularly
in the contest scenes. And the film gets an extra star just for not
having Kristofferson strut his stuff.

</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most audacious thing about writer-director Neil LaBute's new
movie, ``Your Friends and Neighbors,'' isn't its subject _ couples
bouncing around in sexual roundelays _ or even a scene featuring
the most heartless of them, Jason Patric, drop-kicking a plastic
infant he's just plucked from a model of a womb. There's no
messiness for LaBute, just conquerors and victims, which is the way
he lets audiences off the hook; there's a self-congratulatory
quality to his cruelty, like that of documentary filmmaker Michael
Moore. So his newest film is about as close to the edge as a Yes
album; ``Your Friends and Neighbors'' is like ``Carnal Knowledge''
starring the Muppets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends'' follows a married couple (Amy Brenneman and Aaron
Eckhart), a cohabiting couple (Catherine Keener and Ben Stiller), a
carnivorous bachelor (Patric) and a needy lesbian (Nastassja
Kinski). It feels like a play, with everyone giving in to his
constant impulse to explain exactly what he's going through at all
times. There is no possible misinterpretation of anyone's actions;
there are no real surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Stiller is a college drama professor with a beard that gives his
face a rodentlike cast. His girlfriend, Keener, just wants him to
shut up during sex. When she begins an affair with Kinski, Keener
blurts out the same thing. Apparently, she should just have sex
with herself.
</P>
<P>
   Eckhart seems to prefer that; he says his favorite sex partner
is himself, turning the old Woody Allen joke about masturbation _
``It's sex with someone I love'' _ a little too seriously. Eckhart
has softened considerably since playing the heartless womanizer in
``In the Company of Men,'' LaBute's impressively staged first
feature. Now Eckhart is as doughy as a puff pastry, and with the
extra weight, he has made himself physically uninteresting. As his
wife, Brenneman, who has continually beseeching doe eyes, is
intense and nervous; of all the archetypes, she's most sympathetic.
But like everyone else, she's too one-note.
</P>
<P>
   Patric will probably score best with his portrayal of the cold,
forthright stud _ basically, the same guy whom Eckhart played in
``In the Company of Men.'' Insanely self-obsessed, he preens like a
forest animal. Even his conversations with his friends feel like
date rape. He gives a showstopper of a speech to Stiller and
Eckhart, which makes explicit what most psychiatrists say about Don
Juanism. (In a case of cheesy irony, he's a gynecologist.)
</P>
<P>
   La Bute distanced himself from the characters, so we can all
look down our noses at them _ he has turned contempt into a type of
dramatization, creating a shallow superiority that cheapens the
material. In another of the chocolate-covered ironies that LaBute
deals in, none of his characters gets any pleasure from sex. Maybe
his most impressive feat is that he passes that lack of pleasure on
to the audience. He makes you feel dirty for laughing.

SKIP THIS CLASSLESS COLLEGE COMEDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few movies are more irritating than the ones that don't have the
courage of their own bad taste. ``Dead Man on Campus'' is one of
'em: a slob movie that denies its slobdom, a dark comedy that
resists its darkness. As a result, it's just dim.
</P>
<P>
   One expected a dumb movie, but not this dumb; its dumbness would
be forgivable if the movie had any momentum, but it never gets out
of second gear. It takes forever to get to its title premise,
wasting time on a lengthy set-up in which serious-minded premedical
freshman Josh (Tom Everett Scott) is corrupted by his carefree
roommate Cooper (Mark-Paul Gosselaar of TV's ``Saved by the
Bell).''
</P>
<P>
   Josh's grades suffer. Cooper, whose favorite subject is his
bong, doesn't study at all. They both need an out, and they find it
in the college's ``suicide rule'' _ if a dorm student commits
suicide, his or her roommate is given straight A's as consolation.
</P>
<P>
   Having ditched their lecherous, ill-tempered real roommate, Josh
and Cooper set out trying to find a campus basket case in the hopes
that he'll off himself while sharing their digs. This sets up a
series of one-joke sketches involving a loony frat boy (Lochlyn
Munro, who almost breathes life into the movie), a paranoiac with a
Bill Gates fixation (Randy Pearlstein) and a depressed British
musician (Corey Page).
</P>
<P>
   For a movie bearing the MTV Films imprint, the film is unhip.
It's hard for it to maintain credibility when it name-drops Marilyn
Manson to refer to a character who looks and acts like Adam Ant, or
when it has the only computer-driven nutcase in the world who
doesn't have Internet access. The whole film seems to have been
made in another decade, and its actors are like dilutions of their
predecessors. Scott and Gosselaar are likable, but they coast on
personality more than they act, with Scott playing ``Bachelor
Party''-era Tom Hanks and Gosselaar stepping into Bill Murray's
``Stripes'' shoes (Munro takes the John Belushi part).
</P>
<P>
   The film has the further misfortune of coming out after
``There's Something About Mary,'' and face it _ no matter what you
thought about ``Mary,'' it raised the stakes for this genre. ``Dead
Man'' just isn't outrageous enough _ it's too ``nice'' for a movie
about two guys trying to get someone else to turn out his lights.

BUSINESSMAN RUNS AGAIN FOR NEW YORK GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES M. ODATA  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Thomas Golisano, head of a payroll-services
company, has launched his candidacy for governor of New York,
criticizing state borrowing and promising an end to tolls on the
New York Thruway.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in blue pinstripes, Golisano, 56, said Wednesday he
would govern like he directs the 5,000-employee Paychex, the
company he created from scratch. He painted a picture of New York,
under his leadership, as a place where the Thruway is toll-free,
where teachers earn tenure, where debt and spending are in balance,
and where the state work force is lean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am in this thing to win,'' the Rochester multimillionaire
pledged. Golisano is running under the Independence Party banner,
the alternative line he created in 1993 as part of his unsuccessful
bid for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Golisano was compensated to the tune of $695,250 from Paychex
last year and is listed by Forbes magazine as among the 400 richest
Americans. He said he would refuse special-interest money and
donations from political action committees and spend $10 million of
his own money on the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he is joining the race months after the other
candidates, his infusion of personal wealth immediately ranks him
second only to Gov. George Pataki in available campaign funds.
Pataki, a Republican, has raised about $17 million and has $12.2
million on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Golisano's ante solidly placed him in the race for governor,
although he is considered a long shot, political experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's viable, but whether he has a chance to win, I
don't know if anyone at this point has a really good chance at
beating Pataki,'' said Sarah Liebschutz, state government and
political science professor at the State University College at
Brockport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's got a good issue on the debt. He's a very
successful CEO of a business, and he has credibility in terms of
growing a business and not being indebted,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he can put this kind of money in a campaign
makes him a serious candidate because he can buy TV; he can get out
there similarly to (Ross) Perot,'' said Rachel Leon of Common
Cause. ``The sad thing is: You either have to be a millionaire or
friends of millionaire to run for governor in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   After launching an attack on Pataki's penchant for state
borrowing, Golisano previewed a series of television and radio ads
that will cost about $9.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials blast ``borrow and spend Pataki'' for adding $20
billion to New York's debt since 1994, 90 percent of which is the
``back-door'' variety that comes without voter approval.
</P>
<P>
   The spots also claim New York wastes money on toll collectors
and inconveniences motorists with tolls. Golisano would get rid of
both, finding cheaper ways to fund highway maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Using several themes employed by Democrats seeking to challenge
Pataki, Golisano said job growth in New York is well behind the
national level.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is in the lowest 5 percent; that's not acceptable,''
he said. He described Pataki's economic development program as
``corporate welfare'' and said New York gives too much money to
companies that really don't add jobs. And he said pay raises for
union employees should be at the inflation rate with considerations
for productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Laureen A. Oliver, 45, a tax accountant, is running with
Golisano as lieutenant governor. Four years ago, Golisano garnered
4 percent of the vote, spending more than $6.5 million of his own
funds.

author and speaker Juan Roberto Job.
</P>
<P>
   And their numbers are starting to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics are the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population
and are projected to become the largest minority in 2005. By 2050,
one out of four Americans will be Hispanic, outnumbering all other
minorities combined.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers translate into more dollars for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics annually buy $190 billion in goods and services
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that economic influence, corporate America is still
reluctant to embrace this emerging market, Job says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although mainstream America is starting to acknowledge the
importance of the Latino community, we are not easy to categorize
or understand,'' Job said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Latinos come in all shapes and sizes, from lots of
different backgrounds. We have many things in common but are
extremely diverse.''
</P>
<P>
   That richness and diversity of culture can be difficult to
market to, Job writes. It can also go against the conservative,
traditional grain of corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   Even though companies such as Sears, Coca-Cola and Office Depot
have had Hispanics in top executive positions, only 249 Hispanics
executives are at the level of vice president or above out of the
Fortune 1,000 companies last year.
</P>
<P>
   And although there are 2 million Hispanics with college degrees
in this country, the national Glass Ceiling Commission found that
most chief executives of major corporations think that only a few
Hispanics are eligible for top executive positions, Job writes.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare the Hispanic community for the opportunities and
requirements of corporate America, Job has written ``Just Because
I'm Latin Doesn't Mean I Mambo: A Success Guide for Hispanic
Americans'' (Ballentine Publishing Group, New York, 241 pages,
$22.95) The book offers a frank discussion on what it takes to
succeed in corporate America and offers practical advice on
overcoming the stereotypes that may stand in the way of getting
there.
</P>
<P>
   Many Hispanics will be entering unknown territory as they embark
on a corporate career, Job writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Latinos grow up in environments removed from the world of
business. Our fathers might be civil-service workers or mechanics.
Our mothers might be teachers or full-time homemakers,'' he writes.
``We have to learn about corporate America from observing and
listening to others.'' The key is adapting to the new environment,
Job suggests. And that may mean changing ingrained habits and
behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Hispanics are traditionally a modest group, Job
says, yet self-promotion is vital to a successful corporate career.
Extended family ties are also traditional to most Hispanics, yet
corporate careers can mean long hours at the office and extensive
travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cultural paradigms of corporate America tend to reflect
the Anglo-Saxon model,'' Job writes. ``As a result, Latinos who
want to pursue a business career often face tough personal choices
about values.'' Ultimately, everyone must decide on his or her own
priorities and ability or willingness to compromise, Job writes.
</P>
<P>
   This books discusses other issues relating to corporate life,
including education, unwritten rules and codes, career advancement
strategies and mentoring. A list of Hispanic professional
organizations and employee associations is provided in the back.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous stories and quotes by Hispanics in the business world
help bring this book to life.

   FILM-GADJO (Undated) The title character of Tony Gatlif's latest
_ and most enjoyable _ examination of Gypsy life, ``Gadjo Dilo''
(Crazy Foreigner), is a determined young Parisian (Romain Duris)
who, as the film opens, is trudging across the frozen outback of
Romania on a personal quest.
</P>
<P>
   By William Arnold. (story will move in the ``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REGENERATION (Undated) The setting of Gillies Mackinnon's
well-meaning but terminally dreary period drama, ``Regeneration,''
is a cozy asylum in Scotland where British military doctors treat
shell-shocked World War I soldiers so they can be sent back to the
trenches of France.
</P>
<P>
   By William Arnold. (story will move in the ``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-HANDS (Undated) The documentary ``Hands on a Hard Body''
deals with such an obscure subject _ a contest sponsored by a
smalltown Texas auto-dealer _ that it's probably going to have a
hard time gathering a great deal of initial audience interest.
</P>
<P>
   By William Arnold. (story will move in the ``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-BLADE (Undated) ``Blade,'' gives the vampire thriller
formula some new life by playing it as epic _ in fact, as
apocalyptic epic. In this film, it's the vampires that run the
world, and the underdog humans who have to try and take it back.
</P>
<P>
   By William Arnold. (story will move in the ``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-FRIENDS (Undated) Neil LaBute's second feature, ``Your
Friends and Neighbors,'' is sure to both infuriate (at the preview
screening, three people walked out proclaiming, ``These people are
losers!'') and fascinate.
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (story will move in the ``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-STRIKE (Undated) ``Strike!'' brings to mind the 1966 film,
``The Trouble With Angels,'' which featured rebellious convent
school students, played by Hayley Mills and June Harding, pitted
against Rosalind Russell's stern but kindly Mother Superior.
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (story will move in the ``e'' category)

thing about it.

<P>
   FILM-DEAD (Undated) Poor Tom Everett Scott. After an impressive
debut in the Tom Hanks movie, ``That Thing You Do,'' the actor has
slowly seen his career take a downward spiral. First it was ``An
American Werewolf In Paris,'' now this odious and tasteless trifle.
Even the opening credits are morose and crass in ``Dead Man On

<P>
   The American lawn is a gift for folk psychologists. The clipped,
controlled sward in front of the family homestead, meticulously
mown and shorn of alien growths, makes a potent symbol of suburban
conformity and repressed individualism.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the North American tradition of open, unfenced lawns
running down to the roadside contrasts with the European taste for
private gardens bordered by impenetrable high conifers _ a neat
metaphor for setting an open society against one that is happiest
looking in on itself.
</P>
<P>
   All this provides grist for an absorbing exhibition, ``The Lawn,
Surface of Everyday Life,'' running until Nov. 8 at the Canadian
Center of Architecture in Montreal _ a proper city for comparing
the American psyche with the European.
</P>
<P>
   It reveals that over 32 million acres of lawn are cultivated in
North America, and $750 million spent every year on grass seed to
keep them in verdant, apple-pie order.
</P>
<P>
   The perennial grasses from which today's lawns are made were
unknown in North America until the European colonists came. They
found the native annual grasses insufficiently nutritious for their
cattle, so they imported varieties from the old country.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was poa pratensis, now better known as Kentucky
bluegrass; it is still one of the most popular lawn grasses in
America as well as supporting a thriving bloodstock industry.
</P>
<P>
   But what are lawns for? Surrounding a house with grass is
scarcely an obvious or a natural thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed in 1841, in his classic ``Treatise on the Theory and
Practice of Landscape Gardening,'' the American landscape artist
Andrew Jackson Downing wrote enviously of ``the unrivalled beauty
of the velvet lawns of New England.''
</P>
<P>
   When Charles Dickens visited New England the following year he
observed: ``The well-trimmed lawns and green meadows of home are
not there; and the grass compared with our ornamental plots and
pastures is rank, and rough, and wild.''
</P>
<P>
   The cylinder lawn mower had been invented in England in 1830 by
Edwin Budding, but the first American mowers were not patented
until 1868.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the earth was beginning to move for American lawn
lovers. In 1870 Frank Scott, a disciple of Downing, wrote ``The Art
of Beautifying Suburban Home Grounds on Small Extent.'' In it, he
laid down his golden rule: ``Of all the external decorations of a
house, a well-kept lawn is the most essential...
</P>
<P>
   ``If one could imagine Americans to live their married lives,
each pair in one home, what a pleasing variety might the changing
years bring them. An unbroken lawn around the dwelling should
typify the unwritten page in the opening book of earnest life.''
</P>
<P>
   Already then, the lawn was being promoted as a badge of
contented domesticity and virtue. In 1869 Frederick Law Olmsted and
Calvert Vaux, creators of New York's Central Park, designed a
development at Riverside, Ill., where the houses had front lawns
undivided by fences, one running into the next.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion was promoted by the City Beautiful Movement and
adopted nationally but it has not served the intended cause of
unifying communities. Because the front lawn is visible and shared,
families prefer to romp, picnic and play games in their private _
though often smaller _ backyards.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the communitarian ideal. Yet this image of empty
expanses of orderly grass proved attractive to corporate America
when, in the second half of the century, big businesses moved their
headquarters from the cities to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Like its residential counterpart, the corporate lawn is seldom a
locus of activity and remains largely unoccupied, a green moat
subject to surveillance and receptive to control _ a ``power
lawn,'' in the words of the Montreal exhibition guide.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast the White House lawn ``has come to serve as the home
lawn for the entire country...exploited for photo opportunities and
news conferences, peace accords, treaty signings and celebrations
of nationhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The influence of the lawns is not always so benign. There are
snakes in the grass. The show includes a display of court documents
from cases where disputes over the condition of the lawn, the
standard of maintenance, unsightly weeds and unneighborly fencing
have led to litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Many communities enforce stringent regulations on such matters,
with heavy penalties for those who default on their citizen's
obligation to keep the mower-blade turning.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Diller, one of the show's curators, says that
defendants sometimes rely on the First Amendment right to freedom
of expression when confronted with ``an almost fascistic control''
in certain communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lawn is a surface on which a lot of ideas are already
encoded relative to conformity,'' she points out. ``and yet it is
on the lawn where individual identities are played out.''
</P>
<P>
   Something to ponder as, perched aboard your space-age power
mowers, masters of your own turf, you do your civic duty by cutting
each pesky blade down to size. &QL;

   TOKYO _ Deep disappointment in President Bill Clinton,
admiration for the American system and worry about U.S. leadership
during Asia's economic crisis characterized Asian editorial
commentary Wednesday following Clinton's admission of lying about
an extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   Many commentators said the president's moral authority and his
presidency were irreversibly damaged, that he had disgraced himself
and that his televised speech was not sincere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than a straight confession, we got the impression this
was a well-calculated act to protect himself,'' said Japan's Asahi
Shimbun.
</P>
<P>
   In Seoul, Hong Kong and Tokyo, editorials worried about the
impact of Clinton's admission on his credibility as a world leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, however critical we are of Washington's
international behavior, its presence and engagement are necessary
for world stability in the broadest sense,'' said the Hong Kong
Standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially now that countries in Asia and beyond are in the
throes of economic difficulties, a U.S. brooding over domestic
politics at the expense of its international role and obligations
should be strongly discouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Seoul's leading dailies, Jungang Ilbo, echoed that worry.
``The primary concern now is the danger that the U.S. may lose
consistency and trust, for that matter, in its policies,
particularly foreign policy,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know there is a direct link between the credibility of
the president and trustworthiness of the country he represents.''
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo's Yomiuri Shimbun said it was possible that Clinton would
be little more than a lame duck leader for the remainder of his
term, concluding: ``The international community will be paying
close attention to see whether Mr. Clinton will be able to put the
matter behind him and return to the role that is expected of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Words of praise were saved for Hillary Rodham Clinton and the
American system. The Korean Broadcasting System commented Tuesday
night that ``Hillary's attitude was impressive,'' and Singapore
television praised her for ``standing by her man.''
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia, where former President Suharto was forced out of
office this year after 32 years in power, The Jakarta Post said
Clinton had ``shown his gallantry'' by admitting his guilt and it
said it was understandable that Americans, with a robust economy,
would continue to support him.
</P>
<P>
   It added that ``compared to hundreds of millions of people in
countries ruled by dictators and military despots who exploit their
nations' wealth for their own interests, Americans are far luckier
to live in a country governed by a solid constitution that
guarantees their rights and freedom.''

   The U.S. system that forced Clinton to admit before a grand jury
that he lied about an extramarital affair was widely praised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Above all, the Lewinsky affair reminds us that everyone is
equal before the law in America,'' said Hankook Ilbo, a major
Korean daily. ``The case is so impressive because it proves that
the U.S. adheres to the rule of law even when a president is
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of Japan's Parliament, Yuriko Koike, interviewed
Tuesday by the Mainichi Shimbun, said she admired the fight between
politicians and prosecutors as well as Clinton's decision to go
before the nation on television: ``By doing so, the United States
as a nation succeeds in gaining a stronger system.''
</P>
<P>
   But others saw a decline in U.S. public life. ``This phenomenon,
probably, uncovers a far more serious malaise _ the decline and
approaching meltdown of American society itself,'' wrote a
Philippine Star commentator, Max Soliven.
</P>
<P>
   Thai politicians interviewed by The Nation in Bangkok said the
problem was with the lie and its impact on Clinton's credibility
with American voters, not the affair itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the sexual matter, it is up to the American people to
decide how they want their leader to be,'' said one. `` In the old
days, kings had many wives.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly alone as a national leader willing to publicly comment,
the newly elected president of the Philippines, Joseph Estrada, was
quoted by Reuters Tuesday as saying he agreed with Clinton that
leaders are entitled to their privacy: ``Definitely. We are only
human beings. We have to have private lives also.''
</P>
<P>
   Estrada has been criticized by the Catholic church for his
lifestyle. He is reported to have as many as 10 children by various
women.

   President Clinton drew mockery and skepticism from European
newspapers over his confessions regarding his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky, Reuters reported from London.

<P>
   ``Mr. Clinton's tenure will continue for some time to come,''
said The Times of London. But, ``The Clinton era is already over.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Mirror, a tabloid, was equally blunt. ``Bill Clinton

   TOKYO _ Deep disappointment in President Bill Clinton,
admiration for the American system and worry about U.S. leadership
during Asia's economic crisis characterized Asian editorial
commentary Wednesday following Clinton's admission of lying about
an extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   Many commentators said the president's moral authority and his
presidency were irreversibly damaged, that he had disgraced himself
and that his televised speech was not sincere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than a straight confession, we got the impression this
was a well-calculated act to protect himself,'' said Japan's Asahi
Shimbun.
</P>
<P>
   In Seoul, Hong Kong and Tokyo, editorials worried about the
impact of Clinton's admission on his credibility as a world leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, however critical we are of Washington's
international behavior, its presence and engagement are necessary
for world stability in the broadest sense,'' said the Hong Kong
Standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially now that countries in Asia and beyond are in the
throes of economic difficulties, a U.S. brooding over domestic
politics at the expense of its international role and obligations
should be strongly discouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Seoul's leading dailies, Jungang Ilbo, echoed that worry.
``The primary concern now is the danger that the U.S. may lose
consistency and trust, for that matter, in its policies,
particularly foreign policy,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know there is a direct link between the credibility of
the president and trustworthiness of the country he represents.''
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo's Yomiuri Shimbun said it was possible that Clinton would
be little more than a lame duck leader for the remainder of his
term, concluding: ``The international community will be paying
close attention to see whether Mr. Clinton will be able to put the
matter behind him and return to the role that is expected of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Words of praise were saved for Hillary Rodham Clinton and the
American system. The Korean Broadcasting System commented Tuesday
night that ``Hillary's attitude was impressive,'' and Singapore
television praised her for ``standing by her man.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli society suffers from the syndrome of the
abused child. That is the only reasonable answer to the frequently
posed question of how a people that suffered so long, that was
victimized for 3,000 years, can be indifferent to the suffering it
inflicts on another people.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Israel was formed against the backdrop of the most
chilling act of genocide in modern history. Israel cannot escape
that traumatic past. As in the case of an adult survivor of
childhood abuse, a primal insecurity informs our perception of
reality.
</P>
<P>
   Every danger _ whether real or imagined, large or small _ is
experienced in terms of our long history of persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Living in Israel, it is not hard to justify our self-perception
as victims. Suicide bombings in Israeli cities have killed and
maimed dozens of civilians in recent years. Israel remains in a
state of war with half its neighbors. This reality is easily read
in terms of our collective memory as victims.
</P>
<P>
   Yet our identity as the eternal victim prevents us from
realizing that today we are not only victims. Just as some victims
of child abuse turn into victimizers as adults, we Israelis, having
assumed a position of power over others, have ourselves become
victimizers.
</P>
<P>
   It is the syndrome of the abused child that informs the attitude
of the Israeli public to human rights violations committed by our
security forces in the Occupied Territories. Take, for example, the
case of the public debate about torture in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The use of torture by the Israeli security service is routine.
Thousands of Palestinian detainees are violently shaken, kept for
days in excruciating positions, denied sleep for prolonged periods
or subjected to extremes of noise, cold and filth. Israeli
officials publicly acknowledge such practices.
</P>
<P>
   Torture's stigma prompts most nations to deny any use of force
in interrogations, but the Israeli public, at large, supports the
use of torture as a legitimate means to defend security.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's resort to collective forms of punishment provokes a
similar response.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 10 years, Israel has demolished more than 400 houses
of family members of Palestinians suspected of violent acts against
Israel. No public outcry has been raised about this policy, which
has rendered homeless hundreds of innocent people, many of them
children and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli public opinion has also remained indifferent to the
blatantly discriminatory manner in which this policy is applied.
Only Palestinians are subjected to collective punishments.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when 29 Palestinians were killed by an Israeli
settler at the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, Israel took
seriously the fundamental legal principle that every person is
responsible for his or her own acts. It did not take reprisals
against innocent people, such as the family or neighbors of the
perpetrator of the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's repressive policies cannot be compared to the horrors
of the Holocaust. Yet neither can our suffering in the past,
however terrible, be used to excuse present wrongs.
</P>
<P>
   The syndrome of the abused child only exacerbates the cycle of
violence in the Middle East. The experience of occupation and
dispossession has turned Palestinians into the new generation of
``abused children.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, Palestinians often justify the sufferings caused by
suicide bombs in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem by the affliction we cause
to them. This in turn reinforces our self-perception as perpetual
victims.
</P>
<P>
   This cycle of victimhood has profound effects on the potential
for a negotiated settlement of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   A peace process has begun, yet a peace based on human rights
violations is fragile at its core. Collective punishment, brutality
and needless humiliation diminish the willingness for
reconciliation and compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Milestones are often an occasion for introspection. This year
Israel celebrated its 50th anniversary and the international
community is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights. It is a timely opportunity to
recognize and begin to address our syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   We must not forget the past, but neither can we let our painful
history make us complacent toward the suffering we cause to
others. &QL;

   JERUSALEM _ Israeli society suffers from the syndrome of the
abused child. That is the only reasonable answer to the frequently
posed question of how a people that suffered so long, that was
victimized for 3,000 years, can be indifferent to the suffering it
inflicts on another people.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Israel was formed against the backdrop of the most
chilling act of genocide in modern history. Israel cannot escape
that traumatic past. As in the case of an adult survivor of
childhood abuse, a primal insecurity informs our perception of
reality.
</P>
<P>
   Every danger _ whether real or imagined, large or small _ is
experienced in terms of our long history of persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Living in Israel, it is not hard to justify our self-perception
as victims. Suicide bombings in Israeli cities have killed and
maimed dozens of civilians in recent years. Israel remains in a
state of war with half its neighbors. This reality is easily read
in terms of our collective memory as victims.
</P>
<P>
   Yet our identity as the eternal victim prevents us from
realizing that today we are not only victims. Just as some victims
of child abuse turn into victimizers as adults, we Israelis, having
assumed a position of power over others, have ourselves become
victimizers.
</P>
<P>
   It is the syndrome of the abused child that informs the attitude
of the Israeli public to human rights violations committed by our
security forces in the Occupied Territories. Take, for example, the
case of the public debate about torture in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The use of torture by the Israeli security service is routine.
Thousands of Palestinian detainees are violently shaken, kept for
days in excruciating positions, denied sleep for prolonged periods
or subjected to extremes of noise, cold and filth. Israeli
officials publicly acknowledge such practices.
</P>
<P>
   Torture's stigma prompts most nations to deny any use of force
in interrogations, but the Israeli public, at large, supports the
use of torture as a legitimate means to defend security.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's resort to collective forms of punishment provokes a
similar response.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 10 years, Israel has demolished more than 400 houses
of family members of Palestinians suspected of violent acts against
Israel. No public outcry has been raised about this policy, which
has rendered homeless hundreds of innocent people, many of them
children and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli public opinion has also remained indifferent to the
blatantly discriminatory manner in which this policy is applied.
Only Palestinians are subjected to collective punishments.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when 29 Palestinians were killed by an Israeli
settler at the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, Israel took
seriously the fundamental legal principle that every person is
responsible for his or her own acts. It did not take reprisals
against innocent people, such as the family or neighbors of the
perpetrator of the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's repressive policies cannot be compared to the horrors
of the Holocaust. Yet neither can our suffering in the past,
however terrible, be used to excuse present wrongs.
</P>
<P>
   The syndrome of the abused child only exacerbates the cycle of
violence in the Middle East. The experience of occupation and
dispossession has turned Palestinians into the new generation of
``abused children.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, Palestinians often justify the sufferings caused by
suicide bombs in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem by the affliction we cause
to them. This in turn reinforces our self-perception as perpetual
victims.
</P>
<P>
   This cycle of victimhood has profound effects on the potential
for a negotiated settlement of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   A peace process has begun, yet a peace based on human rights
violations is fragile at its core. Collective punishment, brutality
and needless humiliation diminish the willingness for
reconciliation and compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Milestones are often an occasion for introspection. This year
Israel celebrated its 50th anniversary and the international
community is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights. It is a timely opportunity to
recognize and begin to address our syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   We must not forget the past, but neither can we let our painful
history make us complacent toward the suffering we cause to
others. &QL;

MIDTERM EXAM FOR FLYTRAP MAJORS 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID PLOTZ 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton has left for vacation and the American people
may or may not be ``moving on,'' but Flytrap surely remains. The
Speech may have guaranteed Clinton's survival, but it won't prevent
more testimony by Monica and Linda, a possible presidential
subpoena, a tough report by Starr and congressional impeachment
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   So, I propose a Flytrap midterm: 20 questions to help keep you
busy during the August scandal doldrums. Plenty of mysteries about
Flytrap remain. Here's your chance to guess their solutions. (In
this test, as in the SAT, you won't know the results for months.)
</P>
<P>
   1. What did Hillary really know, and when did she know it?
</P>
<P>
   a) Nothing until he told her this weekend. She truly believed
him.
</P>
<P>
   b) Suspicions all along but no certainty till this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   c) Everything as soon as the scandal broke in January.
</P>
<P>
   d) Everything even before the scandal broke.
</P>
<P>
   2. Starr watchers insist he's building a much stronger case
against Clinton than a simple sex/perjury allegation. So what is
Starr hiding up his sleeve?
</P>
<P>
   a) Evidence of obstruction of justice involving the Lewinsky
gifts and job offers.
</P>
<P>
   b) Evidence of suborning perjury involving the ``Talking
Points.'' (See Question 5.)
</P>
<P>
   c) Evidence of suborning perjury in the Kathleen Willey matter.
</P>
<P>
   d) Lots more nasty details about Clinton's sex life.
</P>
<P>
   e) Some or all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   f) Something else altogether.
</P>
<P>
   3. Clinton may have denied that he committed perjury in the
Jones deposition, because he believes what he did with Lewinsky did
not technically violate the definition of ``sexual relations. Well,
what did Clinton and Lewinsky actually do?
</P>
<P>
   a) Oral sex for him, nothing for her; perhaps skirting the Jones
definition.
</P>
<P>
   b) Mutual masturbation, skirting the Jones definition.
</P>
<P>
   c) Oral sex for both, clearly violating the Jones definition.
</P>
<P>
   d) Any other alternative, undoubtedly too icky to be discussed
here but clearly violating the Jones definition.
</P>
<P>
   4. What was one, just one, of the questions that Clinton refused
to answer?
</P>
<P>
   Insert your extremely graphic question here.
</P>
<P>
   5. Who really wrote the Talking Points?
</P>
<P>
   a) Monica. We mean it.
</P>
<P>
   b) Bill Clinton, dictated to Monica.
</P>
<P>
   c) Bruce Lindsey, dictated to Monica.
</P>
<P>
   d) Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   e) A handsome, mysterious stranger.
</P>
<P>
   6. Why wasn't Clinton more contrite and less aggressive during
the Speech?
</P>
<P>
   a) Hillary urged him to fight back, not roll over.
</P>
<P>
   b) He knew Starr wouldn't care how apologetic he was, so he
decided to take the offensive and win the PR war.
</P>
<P>
   c) He isn't sorry and doesn't think he lied.
</P>
<P>
   d) All of the above.
</P>
<P>
   7. Who made the first move, Monica or Bill?
</P>
<P>
   a) Monica.
</P>
<P>
   b) Bill.
</P>
<P>
   8. Will Hillary stick with Bill or ditch him like a hot potato
as soon as he is out of office?
</P>
<P>
   a) Stick.
</P>
<P>
   b) Ditch.
</P>
<P>
   9. How low must Clinton's approval ratings sink before
Republicans pursue impeachment?
</P>
<P>
   a) 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   b) 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   c) 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   d) 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   e) How can you be so cynical? His poll numbers are irrelevant.
They will impeach him if he has committed impeachable offenses, no
matter how popular he is.
</P>
<P>
   10. Will the Lewinsky tapes ever be released? If so, will they
destroy Clinton's reputation?
</P>
<P>
   a) Yes, yes (because they're so much worse than we imagine).
</P>
<P>
   b) Yes, no (because we have already imagined the worst).
</P>
<P>
   c) Yes, no (because Monica will sound too flaky to take
seriously).
</P>
<P>
   d) No, no.
</P>
<P>
   11. Did Clinton's aides really believe his denials? If yes, why?
If no, why didn't they quit?
</P>
<P>
   a) No, they really didn't think it mattered.
</P>
<P>
   b) No, they didn't want to embarrass the administration.
</P>
<P>
   c) Yes, they trusted him absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   d) Yes, they never asked.
</P>
<P>
   e) Yes, they were willfully delusional.
</P>
<P>
   12. With whom did Clinton plot cover stories to cover up the
Lewinsky affair?
</P>
<P>
   a) With Betty Currie about the gifts and Monica's visits.
</P>
<P>
   b) With Monica about everything.
</P>
<P>
   c) With Bruce Lindsey about everything.
</P>
<P>
   d) With Vernon Jordan about getting her a job.
</P>
<P>
   e) Any combination of the above.
</P>
<P>
   13. What is Bruce Lindsey's role in all this?
</P>
<P>
   a) Knew about affair, did nothing to help or hinder it.
</P>
<P>
   b) Knew about affair, helped hide it from Hillary and outsiders
in harmless ways.
</P>
<P>
   c) Knew about affair, helped clean it up in questionable ways
(Talking Points, etc.).
</P>
<P>
   d) Innocent bystander.
</P>
<P>
   14. Will Starr subpoena the president?
</P>
<P>
   a) No, Starr got enough on Monday to nail him.
</P>
<P>
   b) No, Starr doesn't want to risk constitutional crisis.
</P>
<P>
   c) Yes, Clinton ducked too many important questions.
</P>
<P>
   d) Yes, just to annoy Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   15. Starr is probably constitutionally barred from indicting the
president. Whom will he indict in the Lewinsky matter?
</P>
<P>
   a) Bruce Lindsey.
</P>
<P>
   b) Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   c) Betty Currie.
</P>
<P>
   d) Bill Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   e) William Ginsburg, just for the hell of it.
</P>
<P>
   f) None of the above.
</P>
<P>
   16. Clinton knew that Monica Lewinsky and Kathleen Willey were
out there. So why didn't he settle the Paula Jones lawsuit rather
than risk exposure?
</P>
<P>
   a) Paula Jones was actually lying, and Clinton refused to cave
to her blackmail.
</P>
<P>
   b) Clinton assumed they would never find Willey and Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   c) Clinton assumed they would find Willey and Lewinsky but also
assumed Willey and Lewinsky would stay silent, because his women
usually do.
</P>
<P>
   d) Clinton is a fool.
</P>
<P>
   17. The Supreme Court permitted the Jones suit in part because
it would not distract the president from his job. Would the
justices have let the Jones suit proceed if they had known it would
produce the Flytrap circus?
</P>
<P>
   a) Yes.
</P>
<P>
   b) No.
</P>
<P>
   18. Does Clinton really believe oral sex is not adultery?
</P>
<P>
   a) Yes.
</P>
<P>
   b) No.
</P>
<P>
   c) ``Well, it's complicated ...'' 19. According to some reports,
only 40 percent of Tripp's testimony was about Flytrap.
</P>
<P>
   19. So what was the rest about?
</P>
<P>
   a) Vince Foster's death.
</P>
<P>
   b) Kathleen Willey.
</P>
<P>
   c) Threats by White House staffers against Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   d) Her secret tapes of other ``friends'' talking about their sex
lives.
</P>
<P>
   20. What gifts did Monica give Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   a) The gold-and-navy tie on the front page of today's New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   b) The blue tie he wore during The Speech.
</P>
<P>
   c) A jack-o'-lantern pin.
</P>
<P>
   d) A copy of Vox.
</P>
<P>
   e) Sexually suggestive tapes.
</P>
<P>
   f) All of the above.
</P>
<P>
   And, for extra credit:
</P>
<P>
   21. What's on that dress, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   a) Semen.
</P>
<P>
   b) Toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
   c) Laundry detergent.
</P>
<P>
   d) Lemon-swirl yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   e) Nothing.

IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO ELECT FEWER MEN 
</HEADLINE>
  By ROBERT WRIGHT 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton, we're told, is reckless. He was reckless with
Gennifer Flowers (in a bathroom during a party), with Kathleen
Willey (just off the Oval Office), and with Monica Lewinsky (ditto,
ditto, ditto). Heedless of the consequences, Clinton again and
again has followed, as Joseph Campbell used to say, his bliss.
</P>
<P>
   All this may be true. But if it is, how do we reconcile it with
Clinton's behavior in the political realm? There he has carried
risk aversion to rarely reached heights. He will pay almost any
price, in terms of policy, to marginally reduce the chances of
losing an election.
</P>
<P>
   To pick up some superfluous Slavic-American votes, Clinton
decided to expand NATO, something virtually no policy analyst
anywhere near him on the ideological spectrum considered a good
idea. To pick up some superfluous Cuban-American votes, he signed
the Helms-Burton law, which predictably enraged America's key
allies and trading partners. Meanwhile, over in domestic policy,
Clinton's lodestar has been the focus group.
</P>
<P>
   How can it be that these two identities--bold, reckless pursuer
of bliss and timid, desperate pursuer of office--exist in the same
man?
</P>
<P>
   There are various ways to resolve this paradox. One is to
remember that the pursuit of office can lead to bliss. Maybe
Clinton's fondness for the Gennifers and Monicas who are the perks
of a job like governor or president keeps him from taking policy
risks that might deprive him of the job. Maybe his emulation of
John F. Kennedy's lifestyle is what keeps him from abiding by
``Profiles in Courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, Kennedy himself, though nominally the
author of that book, didn't glaringly exemplify its message of
principle above politics. Hence, a general theory: Men who
obsessively convert power into sex are less willing to risk power
for principle.
</P>
<P>
   We can test this theory by using as our control group Richard
Nixon. For all we know Nixon had a tryst or two--but he can't hold
a candle to the legends of Kennedy or Clinton. Try picturing him
cavorting in the White House pool with nude staff nymphs or
confidently steering a beautiful woman's hand southward.
</P>
<P>
   So does our theory hold? Did Nixon's presumed freedom from sex
addiction leave him free from addiction to office? Um, no. That
Nixon had more than a casual attraction to power is a fact to which
various convicted felons on his staff can attest.
</P>
<P>
   If we want principled leaders, electing more men like Nixon and
fewer like Clinton wouldn't seem to be the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it might make sense to elect fewer men
generally. The point here isn't just the well-known claim that men
by nature are more blindly libidinous than women. It is the
Darwinian corollary of that claim: Men by nature pursue power more
desperately than women do.
</P>
<P>
   During evolution, the whole Darwinian point of male power--lots
of sex, lots of offspring--didn't compute for females. For women,
lots of sex didn't mean lots of offspring. Power, to be sure,
brought other benefits to a female's genetic legacy, so women
naturally like having power. They just don't like it as much as men
do.
</P>
<P>
   Chimpanzees, our nearest relatives, are political animals. As
the primatologist Frans de Waal has observed, male chimps ``seem to
live in a hierarchical world with replaceable coalition partners
and a single permanent goal: power.'' For females, on the other
hand, ``coalitions withstand time.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus a male chimp--call him Bill--might be making nice to his
liberal internationalist friends one day and signing simian bills
sponsored by Jesse Helms the next. In contrast, a female
chimp--call her Pat Schroeder--would hew truer to her core
constituency.
</P>
<P>
   So the Bill Clinton paradox--his reckless pursuit of sex and his
timid clinging to office--is indeed no paradox. The former does
seem to explain the latter. But only in a broad, species-wide
sense. The reason men are inclined to put power above principle is
because during human evolution, power led to sex.
</P>
<P>
   This evolution-bred hunger for power is built into men
generally, including those (such as Nixon) for whom translating
power into sex is not a high personal priority.
</P>
<P>
   The solution is obvious: If you want elected officials who put
principle ahead of power, voting for women gives you better odds.
</P>
<P>
   But do keep in mind that gender differences, even fairly firm
ones, are only aggregate differences. The average woman will
surrender less principle for power than the average man. And women
who become heads of state are not average.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, certainly, was no
stereotypical female. (Britain's war with Argentina over a few
barren islands, which Thatcher prosecuted with the zeal of a
Churchill, has been compared to two bald men fighting over a comb.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, though Thatcher may have been more ambitious than the
typical woman, she was a paragon of ideological fidelity compared
with Clinton (or Ronald Reagan). Just as female politicians are
more power-hungry than the average female, so also are male
politicians (even) more power-hungry than the average male. While
admitting that Clinton is representative of my gender, I must add,
on behalf of men everywhere, that he's an especially egregious
example.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's detractors have argued that his alleged treatment of
Lewinsky and Willey is a betrayal of the feminist values he
professes. Maybe. But in another sense his feminist credentials
look better than ever. He has provided--indeed, he has become--a
potent argument for bringing more women into public office.

SEARCHING FOR ROOTS WE NEVER HAD 
</HEADLINE>
 STEIN-NYTSF  By HERBERT STEIN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the summer, people come to New England--Vermont, Cape Cod,
Martha's Vineyard, Maine--for the natural amenities, the water, the
mountains, the clear, fresh, cool air, the blue skies.
</P>
<P>
   But they also come, I think, in search of their roots. They want
not only to find but also to identify with the America of 200 years
ago. They want to sit on the porch of the local country store and
drink coffee and eat blueberry muffins. They want to browse through
the flea market searching for some memento that connects with, let
us say, 1830. If they are near the sea they want to eat lobsters by
the peck. Some of the men will grow little beards, to be shaved off
after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the summer people have been coming to the same small
town for so many years, even for more than one generation, that
they are part of the local scene and do have roots there. I am
thinking of the more occasional visitors. Very few have roots in
small-town New England. Some may have Boston roots. More have New
York and New Jersey roots. And most have roots two or three
generations back in Lithuania or Ireland or Sicily. But they like
to think of themselves as having a family connection with early
America.
</P>
<P>
   These small New England towns are part of the origins of the
political, economic and social world we all live in. But so are
Philadelphia and Charlottesville, Va. The summer people coming to
these small towns are not tourists looking for a civics lesson.
They are, it seems to me, seeking and imagining a more personal,
familial connection. That is what I mean by ``roots.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't deride this at all. On the contrary, I think it is
wonderful that people here should become so Americanized, so
naturalized, that they come to admire and seek to identify with a
history in which their families had no part. It is a testament to
openness and democracy in America that so many of us want this
connection and succeed in achieving it.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know this, but I doubt that this absorption occurs
elsewhere in the world. Would a person whose family had lived in
France or Japan for three generations come to identify himself with
the French or the Japanese culture of 200 years ago as if his
family had been a part of it? I don't think so, unless the person
was exceptionally rich or distinguished and so transcended national
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The search for roots is a common phenomenon. People want to see
where they came from in order to understand and appreciate
themselves better. The Irish like to go back to the Old Sod and see
the conditions in which their grandparents lived and perhaps meet
relatives they had not known before. The same seems to be true of
Italians and probably others. But the New England phenomenon is the
adoption of roots that are not really there.
</P>
<P>
   Why do people seek ersatz roots to identify with? Perhaps
because the world changes so rapidly that for many people, the real
roots no longer exist. Once on a trip to Detroit, where I was born,
I tried to visit the scenes of my boyhood. Nothing remained that
had any possible connection with me. The scene of my mother's
childhood, Brownsville, in Brooklyn, is now light-years distant
from the culture in which she grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Finding real roots is especially difficult for Jews of eastern
European origin. The shtetl in Belarus that my father left to come
to America as a boy, over 100 years ago, certainly bears no traces
of my origins--if it still exists. Hitler was quite thorough in
cutting us off at the roots. Some American Jews do go back to visit
the larger eastern European cities in which Jews once lived. But
the occasion is one for mourning a separation, not for celebrating
a connection.
</P>
<P>
   Many Jews find a trace of their roots in Israel. They can look
at those stony fields and think that members of their families
lived and worked there. But that was a long, long time ago, and the
connection grows faint.
</P>
<P>
   So we--and now I do not speak only of Jews--come to small New
England towns to find our roots and imagine an old family
connection. I understand that the ``natives,'' the year-round
residents, do not want to adopt the visitors into their
families--and may even resent them. But they are courteous. For one
thing, they are all in the business of selling roots. And maybe in
the long winter nights the ``natives'' may realize that they are
not really natives either, that there were Native Americans here
before them who have now been cut off from their roots.

NOTES ON THE NON-CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  By JACOB WEISBERG 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Warner Bros. took the unprecedented step last week of refusing
to let reviewers see ``The Avengers'' before it was released. The
widespread assumption was that the studio knew the movie was a dog
but was hoping to salvage a good opening weekend before people
found out. But by locking the critics out, knowing this would be
widely publicized, Warner Bros. was essentially announcing to the
world that ``The Avengers'' was a dog. It's as futile as a
restaurant publicly refusing to allow a health department
inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was a big bluff. Maybe Warner Bros. was trying to
propitiate the film critics--a largely disgruntled and demoralized
bunch. By publicly sacrificing ``The Avengers,'' a sure flop in any
case, studio executives flattered the critics by pretending to be
deeply afraid of them. They also bolstered an important delusion:
that a movie as awful as ``The Avengers'' is the exception and not
the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Singling out ``The Avengers'' as terrible implies that the other
current Warner Bros. releases--''Lethal Weapon 4,'' ``The
Negotiator,'' and ``A Perfect Murder''--are not equally worthless.
Reviewers too have a stake in keeping up the pretense that most
films are worth reviewing. Were they to acknowledge that 95 percent
of what comes out of Hollywood is eyewash, there wouldn't be much
left for most of them to do.
</P>
<P>
   You might argue that movies aren't so bad nowadays. But that
would only prove that you haven't spent much time at the multiplex
this summer. Here are the big summer releases from the other major
studios: ``The X-Files;'' ``Small Soldiers;'' ``Armageddon;'' ``Six
Days, Seven Nights;'' ``Something About Mary;'' ``Ever After;''
``The Mask of Zorro;'' ``Dr. Dolittle;'' ``Mulan;'' ``Jane Austen's
Mafia;'' ``BASEketball;'' ``Disturbing Behavior;'' ``Madeline;''
``Out of Sight;'' ``Halloween: H20;'' ``Saving Private Ryan;''
``The Parent Trap;'' and ``Snake Eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Subtract ``Saving Private Ryan,'' which was a virtuoso piece of
moviemaking despite its hack storytelling, and subtract one or two
others that qualify as harmless fun. What you have left is a run of
formula films and glorified video games pitched to the adolescent
audience.
</P>
<P>
   It's not necessary to see these films to know how dismal they
are, because they are reiterations of other bad films. To be sure,
there were plenty of crummy genre films in the golden age of
cinema. And good ones still break through from time to time. But it
would be seriously perverse to maintain that mainstream film is a
robust popular art form.
</P>
<P>
   The sorry condition of popular cinema leaves film critics in a
quandary. David Denby argued in a New Yorker article earlier this
year that they face a choice of being either hucksters or cranks.
Either they declare that pablum is delicious, or they sink into
chronic dyspepsia.
</P>
<P>
   Most movie reviewers occupy a middle ground between Don Quixote
and the Yellow Kid. Typically, they fell in love with movies when
movies were better and are trying not to notice that their love
object has shriveled into hagdom. They're not overtly corrupt, but
their standards are in a condition of collapse. They appraise poor
films as good and fair films as great. When something flawed but
interesting such as ``Bulworth'' or ``The Truman Show'' breaks
through, they overpraise it in an cringe-making way.
</P>
<P>
   Into this category go Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune, who
recently gave a rave to ``Armageddon;'' his Sneak Previews buddy
Roger Ebert (who calls ``The Negotiator'' ``a thriller that really
hums along''); David Ansen of Newsweek; and Richard Schickel of
Time. Even Janet Maslin of the New York Times, intelligent though
she is, seems headed down this slope when she enthuses about
``Lethal Weapon 4'' or prostrates herself before the latest
Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   I have two theories about why movie critics are so
uncritical--one aesthetic, the other economic.
</P>
<P>
   The aesthetic explanation is that critics see so many bad movies
that their taste deteriorates. If you are forced to spend your
afternoon sitting through ``Godzilla,'' ``Armageddon'' comes as a
relief.
</P>
<P>
   The economic explanation is that movie reviewers are really part
of the movie industry. They exist to encourage people to see movies
in general, even if they must discourage them from seeing some in
particular. In all but a few places, a reviewer who consistently
pans blockbusters is likely to run into trouble with his superiors.
Movie ads are a major source of revenue for papers and magazines
and TV stations, and editors and publishers don't want some
``elitist'' reviewer threatening that money. Most critics can tell
you stories about the pressure on them to be upbeat and populist.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, Susan Sontag argued in an article in the
New York Times Magazine that the decline of film quality is a
demand-driven problem. What's killing cinema as an art form is the
demise of the audience with a taste for serious and challenging
films. If she's right, there may not be much reviewers can do. But
it would be nice to see them rage a little against the degradation
of the medium they're supposed to love.
</P>
<P>
   One way to protest would be to follow the ``crank'' critics in
acknowledging that movies such as ``Deep Impact'' and ``Small
Soldiers'' don't require evaluation. A newspaper that wants to
serve its readers well can provide a paragraph-long capsule and a
Zagat-style reader rating instead.
</P>
<P>
   Critics should address the larger question of why Hollywood
thinks so little of today's film audience. And if Warner Bros.
doesn't want ``The Avengers'' reviewed, reviewers should be only
too happy to oblige.

 c.1998 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Contemplating America this week has been like watching a
gigantic edition of The Jerry Springer Show.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of the usual procession of dysfunctional
representatives of the U.S. underclass, falling over their own
blubber and ponytails in an attempt to knock five kinds of
theatrical crap out of each other, we have _ up on stage (a big
hand folks!) _ Bill, Monica, Ken Starr, Hillary, Linda Tripp and as
many others as can be conceivably subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the audience made up of the usual mischievous voyeurs,
who enjoy nothing better than to yell ``whoarrr!'' in mock horror
whenever a fight looks likely.
</P>
<P>
   No, this special show is being conducted entirely in front of a
handpicked audience of sober-suited media commentators, columnists,
political journalists, presenters and editors.
</P>
<P>
   The strapline at the bottom of the screen reads, ``They Had Sex.
Or Did They?'' This event is (unlike the alleged sex itself) both
salacious and exhausting. And clearly, for those in the audience,
it is addictive.
</P>
<P>
   For what is truly remarkable about the Monica Lewinsky affair is
how the American people themselves say ``it isn't that important,''
and how most journalists seem to come up with ever more ingenious
arguments for why it is, in fact, the biggest show in town. And why
it should never, ever, end.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there seems to be a wide agreement among pundits that
Bill Clinton's rather pathetic address to the nation on Monday
night could not represent the final stage of the drama.
</P>
<P>
   He had not been frank enough. Nor had the president, apparently,
answered all of Ken Starr's detailed questions earlier about
exactly what he and Lewinsky had done.
</P>
<P>
   This, you see, was important when establishing whether Clinton
had grounds for saying that what happened did not constitute a
sexual relationship. He should, said the broadsheet press (both
here and over there), have answered these questions candidly.
</P>
<P>
   Really? Reading the gossipy Drudge Report on the Internet this
morning, I came across this line: ``The DRUDGE REPORT has learned
that Monica Lewinsky, when asked by prosecutors if the president
performed `cunnilingus' on her, responded by saying she did not
know what the word `cunnilingus' meant.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Ken Starr asked Clinton the same question. Or perhaps
the independent counsel asked the president, in detail, about the
suggestion that Bill had allowed Monica to fellate him for a while,
and had then procured his own climax while the chubby intern danced
a little Salome number on the Oval Office carpet.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that their conversation turned to the propulsive
qualities of the presidential semen, and its capacity for landing
far away. Anyway, Clinton refused to answer such queries, labelling
them as ``intrusive,'' whereas the conventional wisdom is that he
should have replied candidly.
</P>
<P>
   Let us not forget why all this semen and cunnilingus stuff is
supposed to matter. In 1991, before he was elected, Clinton
probably (though he denies it) showed his willy to a woman called
Paula Jones in a hotel bedroom. She did not want to see it, told
him so, and he put it away again.
</P>
<P>
   Several years later she filed a case against him for sexual
harassment, and subpoenaed everyone that might have had any carnal
knowledge of him.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Linda Tripp bearing tapes, enter Monica Lewinsky, enter
Clinton's evasion (or lie) to the Paula Jones grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Jones's case _ a civil one _ was dismissed, not because of
Clinton's testimony, but because the allegation did not amount to
harassment. But by now Ken Starr was on the case. If Clinton had
fibbed then, he was a perjurer. If he had attempted to get Monica
to fib, then he was suborner.
</P>
<P>
   So, despite the fact that the original case had come to nothing,
despite the fact that the Monica relationship was (according to
her) consensual, if Ken could show that there had been knobbing,
then he had his man by the short and curlies.
</P>
<P>
   A Martian, landing on earth at this point, might wonder at the
sanity of the whole business. Indeed, an American landing in
Washington might wonder the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   I am not going to go into the question of whether lying in court
about your consensual sexual relationships constitutes perjury or
not. If it does, then it's a perjury that many decent people would
commit, and feel themselves entitled to commit. Most Americans know
this, even if the press doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   They also know that several good American presidents have
strayed, some far more egregiously than Bill. And they no more
expect to judge presidents by their lower body polkas, than they
query the world-renowned surgeon who ogles the anesthetist, or the
skilled pilot with a girl in every airport. But, according to the
press, they haven't truly understood.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's Washington Post, for instance, the comment was
universally unfavorable to Clinton. Columnist David Broder
encapsulated the argument when he disputed Clinton's claim that it
was nobody's business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would that it were so,'' intoned Broder, piously. ``But he
made it our business _ the nation's burden _ first by showing utter
disrespect for the high office he holds, and second by refusing all
this time to do what he alone could do: clear up the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Broder even invoked a previous crisis. ``He (Clinton) not only
lied to Paula Jones's lawyers, he lied to the public and to his
closest political associates, and implicated the leaders of his
party and his government in the deception. In all those respects,
Clinton's behavior is truly Nixonian.''
</P>
<P>
   This is such staggering rubbish, that it makes one despair.
Nixon engaged in a criminal conspiracy to burgle opponents, and to
cover up the results.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Contemplating America this week has been like watching a
gigantic edition of The Jerry Springer Show.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of the usual procession of dysfunctional
representatives of the U.S. underclass, falling over their own
blubber and ponytails in an attempt to knock five kinds of
theatrical crap out of each other, we have _ up on stage (a big
hand folks!) _ Bill, Monica, Ken Starr, Hillary, Linda Tripp and as
many others as can be conceivably subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the audience made up of the usual mischievous voyeurs,
who enjoy nothing better than to yell ``whoarrr!'' in mock horror
whenever a fight looks likely.
</P>
<P>
   No, this special show is being conducted entirely in front of a
handpicked audience of sober-suited media commentators, columnists,
political journalists, presenters and editors.
</P>
<P>
   The strapline at the bottom of the screen reads, ``They Had Sex.
Or Did They?'' This event is (unlike the alleged sex itself) both
salacious and exhausting. And clearly, for those in the audience,
it is addictive.
</P>
<P>
   For what is truly remarkable about the Monica Lewinsky affair is
how the American people themselves say ``it isn't that important,''
and how most journalists seem to come up with ever more ingenious
arguments for why it is, in fact, the biggest show in town. And why
it should never, ever, end.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there seems to be a wide agreement among pundits that
Bill Clinton's rather pathetic address to the nation on Monday
night could not represent the final stage of the drama.
</P>
<P>
   He had not been frank enough. Nor had the president, apparently,
answered all of Ken Starr's detailed questions earlier about
exactly what he and Lewinsky had done.
</P>
<P>
   This, you see, was important when establishing whether Clinton
had grounds for saying that what happened did not constitute a
sexual relationship. He should, said the broadsheet press (both
here and over there), have answered these questions candidly.
</P>
<P>
   Really? Reading the gossipy Drudge Report on the Internet this
morning, I came across this line: ``The DRUDGE REPORT has learned
that Monica Lewinsky, when asked by prosecutors if the president
performed `cunnilingus' on her, responded by saying she did not
know what the word `cunnilingus' meant.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Ken Starr asked Clinton the same question. Or perhaps
the independent counsel asked the president, in detail, about the
suggestion that Bill had allowed Monica to fellate him for a while,
and had then procured his own climax while the chubby intern danced
a little Salome number on the Oval Office carpet.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that their conversation turned to the propulsive
qualities of the presidential semen, and its capacity for landing
far away. Anyway, Clinton refused to answer such queries, labelling
them as ``intrusive,'' whereas the conventional wisdom is that he
should have replied candidly.
</P>
<P>
   Let us not forget why all this semen and cunnilingus stuff is
supposed to matter. In 1991, before he was elected, Clinton
probably (though he denies it) showed his willy to a woman called
Paula Jones in a hotel bedroom. She did not want to see it, told
him so, and he put it away again.
</P>
<P>
   Several years later she filed a case against him for sexual
harassment, and subpoenaed everyone that might have had any carnal
knowledge of him.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Linda Tripp bearing tapes, enter Monica Lewinsky, enter
Clinton's evasion (or lie) to the Paula Jones grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Jones's case _ a civil one _ was dismissed, not because of
Clinton's testimony, but because the allegation did not amount to
harassment. But by now Ken Starr was on the case. If Clinton had
fibbed then, he was a perjurer. If he had attempted to get Monica
to fib, then he was suborner.
</P>
<P>
   So, despite the fact that the original case had come to nothing,
despite the fact that the Monica relationship was (according to
her) consensual, if Ken could show that there had been knobbing,
then he had his man by the short and curlies.
</P>
<P>
   A Martian, landing on earth at this point, might wonder at the
sanity of the whole business. Indeed, an American landing in
Washington might wonder the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   I am not going to go into the question of whether lying in court
about your consensual sexual relationships constitutes perjury or
not. If it does, then it's a perjury that many decent people would
commit, and feel themselves entitled to commit. Most Americans know
this, even if the press doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   They also know that several good American presidents have
strayed, some far more egregiously than Bill. And they no more
expect to judge presidents by their lower body polkas, than they
query the world-renowned surgeon who ogles the anesthetist, or the
skilled pilot with a girl in every airport. But, according to the
press, they haven't truly understood.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's Washington Post, for instance, the comment was
universally unfavorable to Clinton. Columnist David Broder
encapsulated the argument when he disputed Clinton's claim that it
was nobody's business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would that it were so,'' intoned Broder, piously. ``But he
made it our business _ the nation's burden _ first by showing utter
disrespect for the high office he holds, and second by refusing all
this time to do what he alone could do: clear up the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Broder even invoked a previous crisis. ``He (Clinton) not only
lied to Paula Jones's lawyers, he lied to the public and to his
closest political associates, and implicated the leaders of his
party and his government in the deception. In all those respects,
Clinton's behavior is truly Nixonian.''
</P>
<P>
   This is such staggering rubbish, that it makes one despair.
Nixon engaged in a criminal conspiracy to burgle opponents, and to
cover up the results.
</P>
<P>
   He and Kissinger also connived at the secret destruction of
Cambodia, the overthrow of the democratically elected government of
Chile, and the unnecessary bombing of North Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Other presidents waged secret war against Cuba, organized the
military removal of the progressive and elected government of
Guatemala (with the consequence of the deaths of many thousands of
innocent people), fabricated the Gulf of Tonkin incident, and _
latterly _ permitted Contragate.
</P>

   And this litany of presidential sins is supposed to be less

<P>
   A crucial part of the U.S. innovation system is the ready
availability of venture capital to back startup companies in
high-tech fields. The venture markets have been roaring in recent
years _ pouring private money into fledging companies.
</P>
<P>
   Recent data from a variety of sources show that 1997 was a
banner year for new private investment, particularly in information
technology companies _ and that 1998 looks like another winner.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers, says Pat Gray, a managing partner at Price
Waterhouse, are particularly ``heartening'' because they point to
investments in a diverse mix of businesses and for companies at
different stages of development.
</P>
<P>
   Investment growth, he says, ``was pretty broad-based, except in
biotech. Software and communications hit the cover off the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   These optimistic sentiments are based on numbers from several
sources. Price Waterhouse, the New York-based consulting firm, says
venture capital investments climbed to $12.8 billion in 1997, up 34
percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The company's numbers show that most of the money _ about $8.5
billion _ went to high-tech businesses, such as Internet services,
software companies, and computer firms.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups that track venture investments paint a similar
picture. Private investments have nearly doubled during the past
three years, says Rolf Selvig, director of business development at
San Francisco-based VentureOne.
</P>
<P>
   If private investment is a crucial part of the innovation
system, so is the next step in the process: the initial public
offerings (IPOs) that bring public money into the startups. And
there the picture isn't quite so rosy.
</P>
<P>
   IPOs for venture-backed companies slowed dramatically in 1997.
After a record year in 1996, the number of IPOs for startups
dropped 41 percent in 1997 and the amount of money raised plummeted
by 43 percent to $5.4 billion, according to VentureOne.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the slowdown in IPO markets, there's lots of
venture money available.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, says, Clinton Harris, an investment advisor at Grove
Street Advisors in Lexington, Mass., for entrepreneurs and venture
capitalists, ``it's a wonderful time.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Harris raises a cautionary note. ``If you're an
investor it may be worrisome.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris believes the danger is that the success rate of
venture-backed companies will drop. While the supply of money is
growing, he says, ``the availability of high-quality investments is
not changing as quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet because of the natural lag time in venture markets, says
Harris, ``if there is too much money now, it will still be two to
three years before the returns drop.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, it looks as though the venture capital cog in
the innovation system is turning at a high rate. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes it seems as though the Internet had been invented to
foster manic depression.
</P>
<P>
   There's the glee of finding information in a few seconds. Then
the head-banging frustration of waiting as an image fills the
screen pixel by excruciating pixel.
</P>
<P>
   Most home Net users, in particular, sip data through modems
operating at 28.8 kilobits per second. The newest modems offer 56
kilobits per second _ not an overwhelming boost.
</P>
<P>
   But home Internet users may soon have available to them the Net
equivalent of lithium.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this year, phone companies will begin to offer a
technology called ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line) that
will bring fast network access through the copper wires that still
connect virtually every home to the phone network.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone within a few miles of a phone switching center can get
the benefits of ADSL _ connection rates exceeding today's fastest
modems by some 20-fold. And an ADSL connection is like an
electrical socket: It's always on.
</P>
<P>
   ADSL works because most households need high-speed connection in
only one direction. ADSL grants the high downloading speed by
splitting the information stream in two _ a low-frequency channel
for voice and a high-frequency one for data.
</P>
<P>
   This separation allows the copper to carry data at speeds of up
to 7 megabits per second in one direction without interfering with
the voice conversations that occupy the same wires.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for ADSL is not new. But phone companies have until now
treated it as an exotic service, and it has required installing an
electronic filtering device, or ``splitter,'' at each home.
</P>
<P>
   To accelerate ADSL's penetration into the consumer market, a
host of computer and telecommunications companies have joined
forces to push for a new standard that would eliminate the need for
the splitter _ although by limiting data rates to less spectacular
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``universal ADSL'' would permit downloads at 1.5
megabits per second and upstream transmission at 500 kilobits per
second.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the drive for universal ADSL is a coalition of three
dominant players in the personal computer industry _ Compaq, Intel,
and Microsoft _ and several regional phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone companies will probably be conducting trials of the
service by year's end, and widespread availability should begin
sometime in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ADSL should have an edge over another telephone technology _
ISDN (integrated services data network), which provides only 128
kilobits per second. This latest ingredient in the
telecommunications alphabet soup should provide more substantial
nourishment. &QL;

   Remember monorail? That Jetson-era relic, one step above an
amusement park ride, zipping around airports, hotels, and yes,
amusement parks?
</P>
<P>
   For a brief moment in the 1960s, monorail _ cars or trains
running on or under a single, elevated guide rail _ looked like the
future of mass transit. But that bright vision was eclipsed by a
surge of highway building and, more recently, the rush to build
urban light-rail systems.
</P>
<P>
   Monorail was written off as a novelty, fine for Disneyland but
hardly a serious option.
</P>
<P>
   But yesterday's dreams are today's leaps forward. Thanks partly
to technological improvements, partly to new recognition of the
limitations of conventional rail, and especially to the grass-roots
activism of impatient citizens, monorail is making a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Today, space-short Japan leads the world in elevated transit,
with eight urban monorails. Sydney, Vancouver, and Singapore all
use monorails, as do planned communities in Brazil and parks in
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Now monorail boosters in several U.S. cities are vying to make
their towns next on the list.
</P>
<P>
   In Salt Lake City, those boosters recently attempted to persuade
transit officials to build a monorail in place of a controversial
planned light-rail system, on the ground that light rail would eat
too many precious street lanes.
</P>
<P>
   That effort failed, but monorail boosters have made more headway
with the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana Regional Council, which has proposed
a new light-rail system for the Cincinnati metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Vexed because light-rail vehicles can't handle the grade to the
regional airport on their side of the Ohio River, residents of
Covington, Ky., are pressing for a switch to monorail, whose rubber
tires and enclosed guideways provide better traction than
steel-wheeled light-rail vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   They've persuaded their congressman, Jim Bunning, to arrange
federal funding to study the monorail option.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Seattle, home of the mile-long monorail left from the
1962 World's Fair, that has given the technology its broadest
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Seattle voters approved a 42-mile monorail system
running to all four corners of the city, over the opposition of
city officials and the business establishment, who favored light
rail and buses.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot measure was an unusual exercise in do-it-yourself
transit planning, drafted and promoted by an activist/cab driver,
Dick Falkenbury, who says he got the idea while ``stuck in traffic,
watching the monorail zip by overhead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Until you get out of traffic, you're still stuck in traffic,''
Falkenbury explains. ``Once you realize that, only monorail makes
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that most U.S. monorails are at theme parks and other
private venues only proves the technology's efficiency, he insist:
``When you build with other people's (i.e., public) money, you
build light rail. When you build with your own money, you build a
monorail.''
</P>
<P>
   Even monorail's critics concede that, because it weighs less, it
can be elevated less expensively than rail. Elevated systems can be
built quickly; because they needn't tango with traffic and
pedestrians, they can be automated, eliminating the driver salaries
that are conventional transit's biggest operating expense. (The
other way to get trains out of traffic's way, digging tunnels, is
prohibitively expensive _ as Los Angeles is discovering.)
</P>
<P>
   Though view-sensitive residents squirm at the thought of a
monorail's elevated guideways blocking their light, today's
guideways are much thinner than 1962's concrete behemoths. And
their pillars are spaced more widely _ 100-plus feet apart in a
leading model from Montreal-based monorail maker Bombardier.
</P>
<P>
   Technical improvements have also obviated another longtime
monorail shortcoming: awkward switching from one track to another.
Bombardier can now switch tracks in 8 to 12 seconds, making
multi-track systems feasible.
</P>
<P>
   But why stop with a conventional, mass-transit monorail?
University of Washington engineering professor emeritus Jerry
Schneider notes that Seattle's Monorail Initiative would allow the
city to implement a truly revolutionary solution: personal rapid
transit (PRT).
</P>
<P>
   Developed in the 1970s and now being revived on three
continents, PRT offers individualized, point-to-point service in
private (say, four-seater) cars running on lightweight,
computer-controlled, elevated guideways _ usually monorails but
sometimes dual rails.
</P>
<P>
   Variously dubbed ``automated taxis,'' ``horizontal elevator,''
or ``personal monorail,'' it's the only transit form that just
might match the automobile's convenience, without its environmental
downside.
</P>
<P>
   The monorail of the future may surprise even its present-day
proponents. &QL;

<P>
   After airline passengers walked through the metal detectors at
Albuquerque airport last fall, some volunteered to be scrutinized
one more time by a device that ``sniffed'' them to detect chemical
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, they stepped into a portal about the size of two
shower stalls, where nozzles puffed jets of air from their
shoulders to their knees. A few seconds later, a computer screen
handed down the verdict: ``clean'' or ``dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   The explosives-detection portal worked so well that researchers
at Sandia National Laboratories, who developed the device with
funding from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), are now
seeking partners to commercialize it.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA gave the researchers $2 million three years ago to
develop a way to ferret out people who are carrying or have
recently handled chemical explosives _ including so-called plastic
explosives _ which conventional methods cannot detect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to cover any and all possible ways an explosive
could get on a plane,'' explains Paul Jankowski, manager of the
FAA's trace detection program, inaugurated in 1992 to stay a
technological step ahead of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The device is based on technology Sandia scientists developed to
protect nuclear weapons facilities from bomb threats and to prevent
people inside the facilities from smuggling out restricted chemical
devices.
</P>
<P>
   It sprays several cubic feet of air over a person's hands and
clothes to dislodge any chemicals adhering to them. The air is
sucked into a device below the traveler's feet and passes through a
chemical sensor called an ion mobility spectrometer that can
identify the chemical signatures of many different types of
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The quantity and type of chemicals detected then appear on a
computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for Sandia's research team was to develop the
preconcentrator technology _ the part of the device that aggregates
the air molecules quickly enough so that the ion spectrometer can
analyze them.
</P>
<P>
   The team succeeded so well that the device can detect very small
concentrations of all ``explosives of interest'' to the FAA,
according to project leader Kevin Linker, a mechanical engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, given the task at hand, neither Sandia nor the FAA
will reveal what types of explosives the device detects or its
sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   Although the initial test, on 2,500 volunteers, worked well,
members of the research team say the process _ at 12 seconds per
customer _ still takes too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is 6 to 10 seconds,'' says chemical engineer Chuck
Rhykerd. ``That's the current speed of metal detectors. It doesn't
seem that long, but once you take your keys out of your pocket, put
your bags on the conveyor belt, walk through slowly, and pick up
your bags, that's how long it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Reducing the speed will be a challenge, he admits. ``Five
seconds to collect the air. Five seconds to do the analysis. We can
probably cut the analysis time by one to two seconds. But cutting
the sample time may reduce the device's sensitivity. It's a
trade-off.''
</P>
<P>
   Another glitch that researchers hope to fix before the device
can go into production is that the machine occasionally sounds a
false alarm. As for what causes the false positives, the
security-minded Rhykerd says: ``I have a suspicion, but I can't
tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhykerd believes that ultimately, the rate of false positives
can be held to 5 percent, ``well below'' that of metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to improving its accuracy, Rhykerd and his
colleagues hope to overcome two other technical challenges:
decreasing size and cost. The machine is bound to be expensive, but
the benefits could also be high.
</P>
<P>
   By way of comparison, the FAA's Jankowski notes, the CTX5000, a
million-dollar machine designed to inspect luggage, is already in
use at some airports. ``And this device is nowhere near that
expensive,'' he adds. &QL;

 `DEAD MAN ON CAMPUS': A NOVEL WAY TO GET ALL `A's'  
 (Production notes at end)   By ANITA GATES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   You'd like Cooper. Everybody does. He's a good-looking rich boy
who arrives for his freshman year in college with chilled martini
glasses in the mini-bar, an abundance of drugs and more charm than
the law should allow. His mottos are ``College is our last chance
to go crazy'' and ``Bad grades are meaningless. They're like
parking tickets.'' Cooper (Mark-Paul Gosselaar, who was Zack Morris
on NBC's ``Saved by the Bell'') parties every night, cuts all his
classes every day and is big trouble for his roommate Josh.
</P>
<P>
   Josh (Tom Everett Scott, who was the sensitive nice guy in
``That Thing You Do!'') is a sensitive nice guy from Indiana, a
serious pre-med student with a heavy course load and a full
academic scholarship. But by midterm he's a changed man, under
Cooper's hedonistic influence, and in big trouble (straight F's).
</P>
<P>
   ``Dead Man on Campus'' is a predictably dumb movie made for very
young audiences, playing to youth's love of excess, and loaded with
masturbation jokes. Gosselaar is so good, however, that his
performance as Cooper sometimes overrides the film's adolescent
tone.
</P>
<P>
   Only one thing can save Josh (from losing his scholarship) and
Cooper (from flunking out and being forced to work in his father's
toilet-cleaning business, ``in the field''). Because of an obscure
longstanding rule at their college, a man in a bar tells Josh and
Cooper, ``If your roommate kills himself, you get straight A's.''
So they set out to find the most depressed guy in school and move
him into the extra bed. (The original third roommate decamped
early, to live with his new girlfriend.) If a student is going to
kill himself anyway, they reason, he might as well do it in their
room.
</P>
<P>
   The first candidate is Cliff (Lochlyn Munro, who appears to have
stolen Gary Busey's facial expression), a hyperkinetic beer guzzler
who is too rowdy for his Kappa Omega fraternity brothers. Cliff's
idea of a pleasant evening is shooting at local police officers
from a speeding car and setting a girl's hair on fire.
</P>
<P>
   The second, Buckley (Randy Pearlstein, whose look is a cross
between John Lennon and Christopher Walken), is convinced that Bill
Gates is after his brain. Buckley also reveals to his new friends
that Kurt Cobain and Vince Foster are both alive and living at
Mount St. Helen's.
</P>
<P>
   The third, Matt (Corey Page, who has an all-purpose MTV look),
is a nihilistic rock singer who reads Camus. His signature song is
called ``Sperm.'' But it turns out he has a few dark secrets
involving television and show tunes.
</P>
<P>
   All three would-be suicides are over the top and fun to watch.
Too bad the film they're in seems to have been at least partly
written and directed by Beavis and Butt-head.
</P>
<P>

EVERYTHING'S NICE. OR IS IT? A CHAT WITH CHEERFUL GIRL MEL B. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Thanks to the burly British accent, the voice on the
other end of the line is hard to understand. Still, the words are
unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello! This is Mel B. from the Spice Girls! How are you doing
today?''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, it suddenly kicks in: Millions of 9-year-old
girls around the world would trade places with me in an instant.
It's a heady feeling, actually.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the reality of it is that I'm on the phone with Melanie
Brown, better known in Spice World as Scary Spice. And it's kind
of, well, scary.
</P>
<P>
   Seems the Girls' publicist wants the biggest female group of the
decade to do all their interviews months before their first
American tour starts. So we're speaking in May, a good 12 weeks
before the fab five _ er, four _ are scheduled to play at
Blockbuster Desert Sky Pavilion in Phoenix..
</P>
<P>
   And because the women haven't toured the States yet, Scary
doesn't have a lot to say that's terribly interesting. In fact,
everything she says sounds mechanically cheerful, like she's been
through this oh so many times. Call her Stepford Spice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've already been in every city in every state doing
radio spots,'' says Scary, the world traveler. ``But I can't wait
for this tour. It's our chance to give back to the fans who have
supported us for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   She's calling from Oslo, Norway, on the eve of the group's last
European show. Forget talk about a backlash, she insists, the
response from crowds has been phenomenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just mad about us,'' she says. ``They scream, they
shout, they cry. They've all been so supportive of us from the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   But European and American audiences are somewhat different. Here
in the States, for instance, the Girls' following seems to be
getting progressively prepubescent.
</P>
<P>
   It's hurt them in radio. ``Stop,'' a bubbly Motown pastiche, was
the group's last single, and it stopped short of the Top 10.
Programmers resisted the disc because the Girls' core audience is
now the under-10-year-old set _ not exactly a hugely desirable
market for most radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Young American girls go from Barney to Baby Spice in rapid
succession. But it doesn't bother Scary _ the least popular Spice,
if the online voting at http://c3.vmg.co.uk/spicegirls/spiceworld
is to be believed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really flattered by the response in America,'' Scary
insists. ``We're singing our own songs, writing our own songs,
bringing positivity to fans. It's really important for them to
understand where we're coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   But, it's been suggested, the Spice Girls probably aren't the
best role models for today's youngsters. There are the tattoos and
the body piercings and the skimpy costumes.
</P>
<P>
   And the music? Shirley Partridge never would have let Keith and
Laurie sing some of the stuff the Spices perform. When Baby croons,
``Be a little bit wiser baby; put it on, put it on,'' in ``2 Become
1,'' she's not talking about funky music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you don't wake up in the morning and go, `Oh, I'm a role
model,' Scary says, apparently in a Charles Barkley frame of mind.
``You just get on with what you have to do. It's always in the back
of my mind. I mean, I know we do have a responsibility because
people do see us as role models. But it's not an overpowering
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The talk drifts over to accents. She doesn't understand why
Americans have a hard time understanding Brits, because she has no
problem with Stateside vernacular.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love American accents,'' she coos. ``They're quite
sexy, especially American male accents. In fact, yours I quite
fancy.''
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious that Scary is no baby when it comes to handling the
media. She knows what she wants and how she's going to say it. Her
conversation is about as well-rehearsed as a Broadway show _
something to which the Spices' slick live act often has been
compared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're writing the third album. So we're with each
other a lot, but it's great. It's not like I have one friend with
the Spice Girls. I've got four best friends; it is literally like
that. It's always nice to know I have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Scary rattled on about her best friends, Geri
Halliwell, a k a Ginger Spice, exited the quintet. Internet gossip
said Scary used to reduce Ginger to tears during limo rides with
her teasing and berating. Apparently, there's a reason she's not
called Benign Spice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fame doesn't really change the person you are,'' Scary
continues. ``If anything, you grow up a little bit more. You mature
a bit faster than normally. You get to kind of see people for what
they really are. You get alert. You're more spiritually aware of
things that happen. It's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of spirituality, it seems the interview is being
conducted on Scary's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 23 today!'' she declares, which is one of those statements
you don't challenge but wonder about. ``It's going to be really
wicked after the show. You wouldn't believe some of the stuff we've
planned.''
</P>
<P>
   She talks some more. She's big on figures. She says that 98
percent of the American tour is sold out. Americans may carp about
a backlash, but the '96 debut ``Spice'' has sold 6 million copies
here; the follow-up ``Spiceworld'' has headed past 3 million.
Figures seem to comfort her, if the critics don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first started, we had so many barriers that we had to
break down as women in the music industry. Nobody wanted to
interview us then _ `Girls don't sell magazines,' we were told. But
at the end of the day, we've got two listings in the ``Guinness
Book of World Records.'' Every single we've released in England has
gone to Number 1. What we've done is absolutely amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people and papers start repeating incorrect information,
it's complete crap. Our fans are still there. Our fans are always
there. Our records are still selling like mad. The press will build
you up and knock you down, but our fans will always be there.''  &QL;

 &HT;    MONICA BEACH REGULARS DON'T WANT 'GRAVY TRAIN' TO END
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Among those Americans who aren't so anxious for
independent counsel Kenneth Starr to wind up his investigation of
President Clinton are the residents of Monica Beach _ the
photographers and TV technicians who have camped outside the E.
Everett Prettyman U.S. Courthouse since January.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a citizen, I guess I am glad to see it ending, but jobwise
_ no,'' said a network cameraman. ``This has been a gravy train.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have mixed feelings,'' echoed Linda Boyle, a make-up artist
for NBC News. ``I'm tired of the saga going on and on. But it has
employed a lot of people in the TV industry.''
</P>
<P>
   With Monica Lewinsky making her second visit before the federal
grand jury on Thursday and Clinton having testified in the White
House earlier this week, the end is clearly in sight for Starr's
investigation into whether the president illegally covered up a
sexual affair with a young intern.
</P>
<P>
   Since the story broke in January, a media village of sorts has
arisen outside the courthouse where the grand jury meets. The
workers number in the hundreds. There are canopies and drink
coolers and lawn chairs galore. Several satellite trucks have been
parked by the curb for months. Others come and go according who the
day's witness will be. On Lewinsky's second visit, there were about
20 trucks plus three ``cherry pickers'' lifting cameramen high
above the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Monica Beach's photographers and technicians are
freelancers _ hired to augment Washington news bureau staffers and
to cover the four entrances to the courthouse. For an eight-hour
shift, they are paid a ``day rate'' of from $200 to $500, depending
on the job and skill level. They get time and a half for overtime,
plus catered meals. The scandal has provided a bonanza for many.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best comparison is the O.J. trial,'' said Charlie Slie, an
independent sound technician.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a windfall for us all _ a great summer job,'' said
Jim Norris, a freelance cameraman working for CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, August is traditionally a slow month in the nation's
capital _ with Congress and the Supreme Court in recess and the
president often on vacation. But not this year.
</P>
<P>
   The story ``is getting good,'' said CNN correspondent Bob
Franken. ``Obviously we're coming to the end of the first act. But
now it's going to the Hill (for congressional consideration). Even
with all its unsavory aspects, it's a hugely significant story.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he will follow the story to Congress, Franken said his
wife is going on a trip to France without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had told her there was no way in the world that I can take
any vacation this year. Well, she said 'I can','' he laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of 'comp time' is a fiction in this business,'' he
said, gesturing toward the canopies that shade correspondents doing
``stand-up'' reports. ``This is what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Linda Boyle does is keep some of the stars of Monica
Beach looking cool and competent for the camera when all around
them are sweating bullets in the noontime heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, its easier outside than in the studio where the
lights are hotter,'' said the NBC make-up artist after deftly
applying powder to accent the cheekbones of legal analyst Cynthia
Alksne.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no real prima donnas,'' she said of the NBC
courthouse correspondents. ``They treat me well because they know I
have to treat them well.''
</P>
<P>
   Located within walking distance of the Capitol and across the
street from the National Gallery of Art, the media village has
become a tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you need a Disneyland pass to get in here?'' joked Al
Johnson, a visiting history teacher from Orange County, Calif.,
With the advent of 24-hour news channels like Court TV and MSNBC to
compete with CNN, he said, ``I guess there is a need for news.
Everybody says they want it over but the ratings are good. I'm no
better. I'm standing here watching, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny and Barbara Jump had stopped on their way to the Capitol
after hearing that Lewinsky was testifying. The couple from
Springfield, Mo., said the media operation was considerably more
complex than they'd observed from watching the coverage on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty wild,'' said Danny Jump.
</P>
<P>
   Well, ``wild'' is not the description given by Robert Giroux, a
freelance photographer working for several magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have mixed emotions,'' he said. Without Monica Beach, ``I
wouldn't be doing as well financially, but I might be a little more
interested in what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven months of shooting witnesses entering and leaving the
courthouse has become a bit ``mind numbing,'' he said. ``But the
money is good. It's job security.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice now that we have sunny weather,'' said Johnie (CQ)
Roth, a freelance TV cameraman. All around, technicians were
lounging in lawn chairs. ``But it wasn't very glamorous when we
were waiting in the cold and rain last winter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fireman-type job,'' he said. ``You sit a lot. But then
that car comes up and out steps Monica and you'd better be on your
toes.''

   MOSCOW _ Some facts and figures about Russia's problem-plagued
economy:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE SHRINKING RUBLE ....
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the week, a Russian ruble was worth about 16
U.S. cents (trading at 6.2 to the dollar). The de facto devaluation
means its worth can slide on currency markets to about 11 cents
(9.5 to the dollar), or 34 percent. Consumer prices have started to
rise to reflect the weakened ruble.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A SMALL ECONOMY GETTING SMALLER ....
</P>
<P>
   Still a nuclear superpower, Russia is far from being an economic
giant. In terms of gross domestic product (GDP), the country's
total output of goods and services, Russia does not make the list
of the world's top 20 economies. Oil is the leading export, but
flat world prices mean less-than-expected revenues. Projections for
1998 show Russia's gross domestic product at just 5.5 percent of
the U.S. GDP, according to Moody's.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WILL THE LAST INVESTOR IN RUSSIA PLEASE TURN OFF THE LIGHTS
...?
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Russia had one of the most robust emerging stock
markets in the world, with gains of 200 percent and more in some
issues. This year, it is the world's worst. Total capital invested
in the Russian market has fallen to below $18 billion this month,
compared with $128 billion at the end of last year. In the past few
weeks, only about a half-dozen stocks listed on the exchange have
seen any significant trading, out of 87 companies on the board,
according to the Russian Trading System.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SAVINGS WIPEOUT FOR RUSSIANS ...?
</P>
<P>
   Only 30 of an estimated 1,500 banks in Russia will survive
currency devaluation, Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov has
predicted. But the impact may not be great on average Russians for
two reasons: Most Russians have no savings. And most of those who
do keep their money in U.S. dollars under the mattress, not in a
bank.
</P>
<P>
   According to government estimates, 77 percent of Russian
households have zero potential for savings. Of the rest, those with
savings of $10,000 or less keep only about 7 percent of their money
in the form of rubles. And the richest, those with savings of more
than $10,000, keep virtually none of their money in the national
currency.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  AMERICA AT RISK ...?
</P>
<P>
   The political stakes are huge should Russia's fiscal woes force
President Boris Yeltsin from office or derail the country's
attempts at economic and democratic reforms. But economically,
Russia simply does not matter much to American producers. U.S.
exports to Russia in 1997 amounted to $3.4 billion, only about 0.5
percent of total U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  BOUND FOR BANKRUPTCY ...?
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Russia announced a 90-day moratorium on its debt
payments. Russian officials insist the country and its major banks
will not default on loans. If it were to, here's who would lose

 &HT;    RUSSIA'S STOCK MARKET: A SMALL BEAR WITH A BIG BITE
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-RUBLE-$ADV23.
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial
categories for use Sunday, Aug. 23 and thereafter.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ ``The potential is certainly enormous,'' Institutional
Investor magazine, the bible of international finance, wrote last
summer of Russia's young and vigorous stock market.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the publication was referring to the potential for
profits, not the catastrophic declines the market would suffer in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian stock market is minuscule by Western standards and
has little impact in the lives of most ordinary Russians. Yet it is
an important barometer of foreign investors' confidence -- in
recent months, a badly withered faith -- in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In two bullish years, the Russian Trading System (RTS), the
country's main stock market, rose 110 percent in 1996, and again in
1997. This year, the market has slumped 78 percent. The 21st
largest market in the world at the end of 1997, it now ranks in the
bottom, similar in size to such minor stock exchanges as Egypt,
Columbia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the majority
of Russians simply lack the money -- the average monthly salary in
Russia is only about $200 -- and the familiarity with free markets
to invest.
</P>
<P>
   The major players are Russian banks, investment companies
representing the wealthy minority in Russia and foreigners, who
must participate through Russian-registered brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian financial crisis has driven foreign investors out of
emerging markets in Russia and elsewhere. The declining world price
of oil, Russia's biggest export earner, has contributed to the
problems, as oil and energy related stocks dominate the Moscow
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The world's worst performing market this year, its declines and
Russia's ballooning foreign debt contributed to the International
Monetary Fund's decision to assemble a $22.6 billion bailout
package for Russia last month.
</P>
<P>
   That loan package was intended to restore confidence in Russia.
It didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Last week alone, the market lost nearly $3 billion and trading
virtually ceased to exist. As of August 18, the market's
capitalization was $18 billion, compared with $128 billion at the
end of 1997. (By comparison, capital in the U.S. market, the
world's largest, at the end of 1997 was $11.3 trillion).
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Trading System (RTS), which handles more than half
of all issues on Russia's stock market, began operating in the fall
of 1995 and currently trades in 87 companies. Russia's other major
stock markets, the Moscow Stock Exchange and the Moscow Interbank
Currency Exchange (MICEX) began trading shares in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The most actively traded stocks are Russia's electricity
monopoly Unified Energy System (UES), Russia's largest oil company,
Lukoil, and the main long-distance telecommunications provider,
Rostelecom.
</P>
<P>
   With prices low, will the market rebound soon?
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe a substantial upswing to profit levels seen in
1996 and 1997 will not come until after the scheduled Russian
presidential elections in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market isn't growing now because the situation is not
stable,'' said Nikolai Gusev, a trader at Regent European
Securities. ``Nobody knows what's going to happen tomorrow.''

`NEXT STOP, WONDERLAND': LOVE LIES IN AN EMERSON QUOTATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end)  
 (JT)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What could be more unpromising in the era of the yuppie romantic
comedy than a movie about two attractive 30-ish urbanites drifting
through the city and just missing each other until fate finally
allows them to connect? Throw in some half-baked mystical notions
that these two lonely hearts are truly destined to be joined and
you have what sounds like a hard-to-swallow sugarcoated cliche.
</P>
<P>
   But wait a minute. What if the lovers-to-be are likable, smart,
complicated people who seem recognizable without being
stereotypical? And what if they're surrounded by a finely observed
supporting cast of friends and co-workers who collectively
constitute a richly diverse group portrait of a whole stratum of
urban society?
</P>
<P>
   That's what Brad Anderson's film, ``Next Stop, Wonderland,''
accomplishes at its frequent best. Weaving together the movie's
many vignettes and characters is a gorgeous Brazilian-oriented
soundtrack that distills the exquisite mixture of melancholy and
yearning _ the bossa nova mood known as ``saudade'' _ that often
defines the emotional texture of the romantically charged single
life.
</P>
<P>
   Set in contemporary Boston, ``Next Stop, Wonderland'' follows
the romantic peregrinations of Erin Castleton (Hope Davis), a
night-shift nurse and Harvard Medical School dropout, after her
politically correct boyfriend Sean (Phil Hoffman) walks out on her,
leaving behind his cat, Fidel, along with a nasty videotape listing
his grievances. Erin's widowed mother, in a meddlesome attempt to
play matchmaker, secretly places a gushy personal ad for her
daughter in a newspaper that flaunts several inaccurate adjectives,
including ``frisky.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie's best comic moments are amusing snippets of Erin's
meetings in a bar with a motley array of prospective suitors. As
they obsequiously spew their lines, Erin takes it all in with a
cool, enigmatic reserve. (In many shots she resembles a younger
Hillary Rodham Clinton.) These suitors range from a motor-mouthed
salesman to a taciturn psychotherapist to a businessman whose
concealed wedding ring accidentally drops out of his wallet. The
funniest is an executive with pathetic bravado who touts the global
importance of the small rubber parts his company manufactures. Also
among the suitors is a group of friends who make a bet on which of
them will be the first to make love to Erin. Discovering their
plot, she devises a delicious comic revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Erin's future lover, Alan Monteiro (Alan Gelfant), with whom she
rubs elbows on the subway more than once without their connecting,
is a financially beleaguered East Boston plumber who works in an
aquarium and is studying to be a marine biologist. Unlike Erin, who
is always on the brink of a sulk, Alan seems a little too good to
be true. Working-class but refined, he is the only man Erin meets
who cites the proper source (Ralph Waldo Emerson) for a quotation
that is reiterated by various suitors (and continually
misattributed) until it becomes a comic leitmotif.
</P>
<P>
   Before Erin and Alan connect, each is diverted by other
potential partners. At her hospital, Erin meets a suave Brazilian
ethnomusicologist (Jose Zuniga) who pursues her avidly and begs her
to fly with him to Sao Paulo. Alan is pursued even more vigorously
by Julie (Cara Buono), his attractive airheaded study partner, who
literally throws herself at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Stop, Wonderland'' isn't really much more than a
beautifully acted, finely edited sitcom, but it creates and
sustains an intelligent, seriocomic mood better than any recent
film about the urban single life. If the movie at moments recalls
``As Good as It Gets,'' its characters are subtler and its vision
of humanity more truthful.
</P>
<P>
   No, it doesn't have barnstorming performances by actors chewing
the scenery while engaging in brassy psychological combat. Ms.
Davis' Erin is not the kind of woman who lets all her emotions hang
out. She is an introvert, a type that the movies rarely embrace
unless that character turns out to be a raving lunatic.
</P>
<P>
   With its smart savvy dialogue (some of it is so good it sounds
overheard) and close attention to the minutiae of body language and
facial expressions, it reminds you of how in an urban contemporary
movie, the details are almost everything.
</P>

   The Russian stock market is minuscule by Western standards and
has little impact in the lives of most ordinary Russians. Yet it is
an important barometer of foreign investors' confidence -- in
recent months, a badly withered faith -- in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In two bullish years, the Russian Trading System (RTS), the
country's main stock market, rose 110 percent in 1996, and again in
1997. This year, the market has slumped 78 percent. The 21st
largest market in the world at the end of 1997, it now ranks in the
bottom, similar in size to such minor stock exchanges as Egypt,
Columbia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the majority
of Russians simply lack the money -- the average monthly salary in
Russia is only about $200 -- and the familiarity with free markets
to invest.
</P>
<P>
   The major players are Russian banks, investment companies
representing the wealthy minority in Russia and foreigners, who
must participate through Russian-registered brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian financial crisis has driven foreign investors out of
emerging markets in Russia and elsewhere. The declining world price
of oil, Russia's biggest export earner, has contributed to the
problems, as oil and energy related stocks dominate the Moscow
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The world's worst performing market this year, its declines and
Russia's ballooning foreign debt contributed to the International
Monetary Fund's decision to assemble a $22.6 billion bailout
package for Russia last month.
</P>
<P>
   That loan package was intended to restore confidence in Russia.
It didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Last week alone, the market lost nearly $3 billion and trading
virtually ceased to exist. As of August 18, the market's
capitalization was $18 billion, compared with $128 billion at the
end of 1997. (By comparison, capital in the U.S. market, the
world's largest, at the end of 1997 was $11.3 trillion).
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Trading System (RTS), which handles more than half
of all issues on Russia's stock market, began operating in the fall
of 1995 and currently trades in 87 companies. Russia's other major
stock markets, the Moscow Stock Exchange and the Moscow Interbank
Currency Exchange (MICEX) began trading shares in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The most actively traded stocks are Russia's electricity
monopoly Unified Energy System (UES), Russia's largest oil company,
Lukoil, and the main long-distance telecommunications provider,
Rostelecom.
</P>
<P>
   With prices low, will the market rebound soon?
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe a substantial upswing to profit levels seen in
1996 and 1997 will not come until after the scheduled Russian
presidential elections in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market isn't growing now because the situation is not
stable,'' said Nikolai Gusev, a trader at Regent European
Securities. ``Nobody knows what's going to happen tomorrow.''

MARY POPPINS WAS RIGHT ABOUT SUGAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coffee to get rid of headaches; ginger and chile peppers to ease
arthritis; rice to soothe digestion; and sugar to help us sleep?
</P>
<P>
   Although sugar is by no means a health food, it can help us
sleep because it triggers the production of serotonin in the brain
to help suppress pain and depression and ease us into restful
slumber, says a pioneer in the healing power of good nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neal Barnard recommends a cookie and some fruit juice about
an hour before bedtime. Milk, he says, causes digestive problems
for too many people and lots of aches and pains that we would never
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   It took us a long time to come around to the fact that a very
low-fat, mostly vegetarian diet can not only prevent but also
reverse heart disease in many cases.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Barnard has put together a lot of evidence to suggest that
such a diet can also prevent as well as cure back pain, migraines,
arthritis, menstrual pain, kidney stones and insomnia.
</P>
<P>
   Barnard is president of the Physicians' Committee for
Responsible Medicine, a nonprofit professional organization that
promotes vegetarian eating and is known for rating airport food and
school lunch programs. He was in Dallas recently to promote his
newest book, ``Foods That Fight Pain'' (Harmony Books, $25).
</P>
<P>
   He says that we are just starting to recognize the power that
food has.
</P>
<P>
   To many people, using foods to fight pain, such as that of
arthritis or migraine headaches, is a foreign idea.
</P>
<P>
   Certain foods can trigger pain while others ease pain, Barnard
says.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the pain-reduction benefit of foods comes from opening
arteries and promoting good blood flow throughout the body, but
some foods seem to provide an analgesic to nerves and work within
the brain to reduce sensitivity, he says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a very low-fat diet, he recommends three major
strategies for nutritional control of pain: Determine which foods
trigger pain for you; find which foods soothe your pain; and use
herbal supplements when necessary to increase the effectiveness of
dietary changes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, many people with arthritis are sensitive to one or
more of the following foods: dairy products, corn, meats, wheat,
oats and rye, eggs, citrus fruits, potatoes, tomatoes, nuts and
coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Barnard says arthritics should first avoid all those foods for
two weeks to cool the joints, then begin adding them back one at a
time, every two days. If the addition does not cause pain, he said,
that food is safe to add back to the diet.
</P>
<P>
   To boost the effects of dietary changes, he recommends
gingerroot in a tea or added to vegetables _ about one-half to one
teaspoon per day, fresh from the grocery produce department or
powdered from a health food store.
</P>
<P>
   The ginger stops white blood cells from making the chemicals
that cause inflammation, he says, and the effect can be boosted by
adding some fatty acids such as flax seed oil or evening primrose.
</P>
<P>
   For migraines, his recommendations are similar except that the
most common triggers seem to be dairy products, chocolate, eggs,
citrus fruits, meat, wheat, nuts and peanuts, tomatoes, onions,
corn, apples and bananas.

`BLADE': PEOPLE WHO DANCE WITH VAMPIRES  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   So much fake blood drips, gushes, explodes and congeals in
``Blade,'' a hyperkinetic science-fiction horror film inspired by a
popular comic book, that there's hardly a scene that isn't drenched
in red. The crimson tide first rises in the movie's opening (and
wittiest scene) in which a young man is escorted by a
sinister-looking woman in a red wig into a disco hidden behind a
metal door in the back of a meatpacking plant.
</P>
<P>
   As the frenzied dancers gyrate to a crunching industrial beat, a
sign suddenly lights up announcing a ``blood bath.'' The music
intensifies, and shower heads on the ceiling begin spewing blood
onto the ecstatic crowd whose heads strain upward to suck in the
precious liquid. Just when the horrified visitor realizes he has
been lured into a vampire club having its Saturday night orgy, he
is overcome by gnashing fangs.
</P>
<P>
   Then who should arrive, spreading panic among the revelers, but
an ominous figure dressed in black leather ludicrously embellished
with what look like automobile seat belts. This avenging vampire
buster, who starts blowing the orgiasts to smithereens, is none
other than Blade (Wesley Snipes), a semihuman warrior whose life is
dedicated to eliminating the night-walking species that claimed his
beloved mother moments before she gave birth to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blade,'' directed by Stephen Norrington from a screenplay by
David Goyer, obviously wants to be the first of many episodes of a
low-rent ``Batman''-style series. Although the opening scene
suggests a dark urban satire, ``Blade'' quickly turns into a
cartoonish futuristic action-adventure yarn in which Blade is the
only thing keeping humanity from being exterminated by vampires in
a hematological holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is awash not only in blood, but in the demons'
mythical arcana as well. The battle scenes are pure comic-book
derring-do replete with acrobatics borrowed from Hong Kong action
thrillers and continual morphing. When a vampire is destroyed, it
can go through one of several transformations. Sometimes it is
shredded into a cinder. At other times, it bloats into a
grotesquely contorted balloon that explodes with a sickening splat.
Or it can turn into a miniature skeleton whizzing around in a
hellish spirit world.
</P>
<P>
   The story pits a trio of good guys _ Blade; his broken-down
scraggly-haired human mentor, Abraham Whistler (Kris
Kristofferson), and Karen (N'Bushe Wright), a resourceful
hematologist _ against the forces of evil. Leading the bad guys is
wiry, sneering Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), a rancid hippie-style
rebel who wants to overthrow the fussy over-cautious vampiric old
guard and get down to the business of world domination. In one of
the nastiest scenes, he and his fellow rebels, wearing suits that
protect them from the sun, lead the senior leader to a beach where
they yank out his fangs with pliers and gleefully watch as the
rising sun decomposes him.
</P>
<P>
   Snipes, who is an extremely limited actor, seems to have finally
found a role in which he appears comfortable. All he has to do here
is look enigmatically heroic and occasionally get roaring mad.
</P>
<P>

IS IT TIME TO WRAP THIS ALL UP?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No, Yogi, it isn't over yet.
</P>
<P>
   Despite President Clinton's testimony to a federal grand jury
and his televised ``mea culpa'' to the American people Monday
night, there is no discernible end yet to the sickening tragicomedy
of concupiscence, prevarication and taped telephone conversations
that has been tormenting the American soul for more than seven
months.
</P>
<P>
   Some political prognosticators have speculated that special
prosecutor Kenneth Starr soon will wind up his
Whitewater-turned-adultery-in-the-White House scandal now that he
has had his shot at the president under oath.
</P>
<P>
   That looks increasingly like wishful thinking. Starr is intent
upon calling more witnesses and recalling some previously
questioned. Then he has to pore over the president's testimony and
somehow weave it into the massive fabric of half-truths and
fragmentary evidence he has spent years and more than $40 million
spinning.
</P>
<P>
   While he is assembling his report, Starr is likely to have his
operatives leak parts of the president's testimony in daily
dribbles to those elements of the news media that he has been
playing like a ukulele.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was the realization, during his grand jury
interrogation, that Starr intended to continue to drag the matter
out that persuaded the president to alter the tone of his remarks
to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   It has been reported that the president had prepared a decidedly
more penitent statement and that what he ultimately said made some
of his advisers and supporters uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Had he believed that doing a presidential equivalent of a teary,
sin-soaked televangelist begging forgiveness would end the sordid
business, Clinton might have waxed more histrionically repentant.
But if he knew Starr would not relent, such excessive
self-flagellation was pointless.
</P>
<P>
   The fact of the matter is that Starr has to try to justify his
extravagant expense account. With that in mind, and given the
amount of rope he has been handed, Starr is likely to persist until
he thinks he can hang the president.
</P>
<P>
   Under the circumstances, then, Clinton did the appropriate thing
by admitting his wrongdoing, taking responsibility for it, and
still holding his head high and making it clear that he intends to
stand his ground against the special prosecutor. That may be the
best way to bring this painful ordeal for the nation to a quicker
end.
</P>
<P>
   By attaching his criticism of the special prosecutor to his
apology to the American people, the president appeared to be
signalling to Starr that he will not be intimidated into resigning,
which appears to be Starr's objective.
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, Starr _ if he has a shred of concern left
about the damage done by his protracted effort to salvage something
resembling success from his failed Whitewater witch hunt _ should
expeditiously wrap up his investigation and submit his report.
</P>
<P>
   If he does not now have sufficient evidence to justify a call
for the president's impeachment, he will never have it.
</P>
<P>
   And the odds are that Republican Party leaders, who have enjoyed
immensely this government-paralyzing fiasco, would not risk pushing
for impeachment because they know that such an effort could
backfire on them politically.
</P>
<P>
   They sense the mood of the public, and they understand that a
majority of the American people consider the Lewinsky affair a
trivial matter that is distracting the government's attention from
much more important domestic and foreign issues.
</P>
<P>
   It's still the economy that matters most to them. The last thing
that most Americans want is a governmental cataclysm that might
propel the surging national economy into a tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   As the minutes ticked down toward Clinton's moment of truth with
a federal grand jury Monday, a daunting question hovered over the
American political landscape: Could the American people handle the
truth?
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, depended upon what the president offered as the
truth to the public, after giving his testimony via closed-circuit
television to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   A few _ very few _ held out hope that the president would
somehow provide a convincing declaration of his absolute innocence.
Most Americans expected the president to admit that he had a sexual
relationship with Lewinsky. But they believed he would make that
admission in a way that would not provide grounds for perjury
charges to be brought against him.
</P>
<P>
   That is what he did. And, judging by the polls, most Americans
can handle that version of the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Yogi, it's time for it to be over.

SPICE WORLD COULD USE REALITY CHECK FROM AN OLD PRO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURI NOTARO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - I'll tell ya what I want, what I really, really want.
</P>
<P>
   I wanna be a Spice Girl.
</P>
<P>
   I hear there's an opening, and that the Pre-Fab Four need a
replacement for Ginger Spice, who left the group earlier this year
because Scary Spice was picking on her.
</P>
<P>
   I think I could do it. I've been onstage before. When I was 9,
my dance school put on a recital for an old-folks home and, right
smack in the middle of our tap-dancing salute to the theme song
from ``The Sting,'' an old man pushed his wheelchair to the front
row, unzipped his fly and relieved himself all over the floor. At
that age, I was completely unaware that men could even do that. As
I stared at the puddle in front of me, my little feet kept
shuffling off to ``Buffalo'' as Judy Garland's voice shouted in my
head _ ``Go ON with the show! Go ON with the show!'' _ while the
rest of my dance class burst into tears, walked offstage or just
plain sat down.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's a pro. I've taken the Official Spice Girls quiz and
found, not by coincidence, I believe, that the one I have most in
common with is that spunky Ginger. We share the bad habits:
``picking our eye boogies''; only telling our friends if there is a
secret sale at our favorite store; and constantly interrupting
others.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a shoo-in.
</P>
<P>
   I already know what my Spice Girl focus is going to be.
Considering that I already had boobs and acne by the time the rest
of the Spice Girls were about to be born, I'll be known as Old
Spice. I'll set the other Spicies straight by informing them that
``girl power'' never meant anything more than their perky cup size,
and that they should quit acting as the voice of feminism until
their boobs have dropped, they've purchased a power tool and have
started growing hairs out of their chins.
</P>
<P>
   Old Spice is about reality. The Old Spice doll will come with a
pack of cigarettes, a chair (Old Spice sits down a lot), tweezers,
a pimple on her neck and inner thighs that rub together and make a
rash. If you pull the string in her back, she won't cry out, ``This
Spice is HOT!'' or ``Be free!'' but ``Pass the salt,'' ``Shut up,
I'm watching TV,'' and ``Does this mole look weird to you?''
</P>
<P>
   If you're frightened by the vision of Old Spice in spandex
shorts and a halter top, I can reassure you that it would take
three days of consecutive shaving for me to be able to wear
something like that. I'm thinking that Old Spice should probably
wear a pea coat, knickers and, on special occasions (like visiting
hospitals, the Grammys and meeting the Queen), an eye patch and a
hook hand in compliance with the nautical theme.
</P>
<P>
   Old Spice, in keeping with her focus, will act as an advocate
for back fat, the swags of underarm flesh that jiggle when mature
women wave and the glory of elastic waistbands. She'll reassure the
prepubescent audience that girl power means it's OK to pick at your
face, body hair should be completely ignored, and Twinkies are
indeed a meal in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not too worried about Scary Spice picking on me, either,
because with one demonstration of how easily a hook hand can rip
out a belly ring, I think all issues will become completely
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Old Spice should also become the boss of writing lyrics, and
I've already come up with new ones:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wanna be my lover''
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't hang with a jerk''
</P>
<P>
   ``Buy your own beer and smokes''
</P>
<P>
   ``Get outta bed and go to word''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wanna be my lover''
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand you're beguiled''
</P>
<P>
   ``But quit looking in my windows''
</P>
<P>
   ``A restraining order has been filed''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wanna be my lover''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, you can't move in''
</P>
<P>
   ``Living in your car may be hot''
</P>
<P>
   ``But premarital sex is a sin!''
</P>
<P>
   Honestly, I realize that it's only a matter of time before the
Spice phenomenon goes the way of Menudo and New Kids on the Block
and the girls go back to working for Heidi Fleiss, so I've got to
act fast. But before the window closes, Old Spice is determined to
get her peg leg through it, even if it does involve capitalizing on
Ginger Spice's bad career move.
</P>
<P>
   I can't be that concerned about it. Ginger Spice is doing fine
in her solo career, because I'm pretty sure I saw her last Saturday
night strutting in a crosswalk in downtown Phoenix, selling her
girl power for 15 bucks a pop.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Preservationists are urging the city to save a
97-year-old Municipal Railway building that is a recognized
historic landmark, but which the transit agency wants to raze to
make way for streetcar and auto parking.
</P>
<P>
   The red-brick Geneva Car Barn at the corner of San Jose and
Geneva avenues was declared San Francisco's 180th historical
landmark in 1985 and is eligible for listing on the national
Register of Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so little to start with, that to think we'll lose this
is something that really upsets me,'' said Carol Ann Taylor,
founder of Neighbors of the Excelsior. ``This building is
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor and other preservation activists say they are busily
contacting city supervisors and the mayor's office in an effort to
save the building.

<P>
   ``My son remembers going there to buy his (street) car tickets
all the time,'' said Tony Sacco, president of the New Mission
Terrace Association. ``To tear it down for what they plan to do is
terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   If the plans are carried out, the Geneva Car Barn would be the
first designated landmark in San Francisco to be razed.
</P>
<P>
   Once used as office space and storage for antique streetcars,
the two-story structure has been vacant since the 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   The Municipal Railway, or Muni, says it cannot afford the
estimated $4 million it would take to repair and seismically
retrofit the building, which is rife with cracked bricks, moldy
stairways, broken windows, peeling paint and the accumulation of
pigeon droppings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely had looked at that (restoration) early on, but
had made a determination it wasn't fiscally feasible in the next 10
to 20 years, and we had more immediate needs for parking for the
old cars,'' said Nancy Whelan, Muni's chief financial officer.

DANCE FILM NEEDS MORE DANCING, OF ALL THINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - ``Strictly Ballroom'' captured the passion and humor
of the ballroom dance craze. ``The Tango Lesson'' explored the
erotic tension of intimate dancing. And the Gap khakis ads
demonstrated how cool it looks if you can swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dance With Me'' misses the beat entirely, making a double
left-footed mistake for a movie about dancers: not enough dancing.
</P>
<P>
   They could have called this one ``Emote With Me.'' Or ``Sit
Around and Get Bored With Me.'' But if you're going to make a movie
called ``Dance With Me,'' let them dance.
</P>
<P>
   Director Randa Haines and her sorry-we'll-sit-this-one-out
scriptwriters go an hour into this movie before they really hit the
dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   What were they thinking? Or were they?
</P>
<P>
   Haines (``The Doctor``) takes long breaks between the dance
numbers for a story about Rafael (Chayanne), a young Cuban who
comes to Texas to work as a janitor at a dance studio owned by John
(Kris Kristofferson), the world's grumpiest dance teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael brings his vibrant Latin rhythms with him. Should have
brought an alarm clock, too _ to wake up the director.
</P>
<P>
   While we're waiting for someone to hit the floor, Rafael falls
for Ruby (Vanessa L. Williams), a teacher who is nervously
preparing to enter the big Latin dance contest for professionals
only. As a pro, she has no time for an amateur like Rafael, who
only dances because the music moves him.
</P>
<P>
   If you're like me or anyone else who has seen a movie in the
past decade, you'll guess that eventually Rafael will sweep Ruby
onto her feet and teach her that real dancing comes from the heart,
not the choreography.
</P>
<P>
   But the director doesn't get her own message and spends most of
the movie working out the problems between Rafael and John.
</P>
<P>
   This leads to a dance movie in which there's more fishing than
dancing, more Kristofferson than Williams.
</P>
<P>
   What were they thinking? I don't think they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dance With Me'' contains one fantastic dance scene in a Latino
club, where the infectious exuberance of the dancing screams that
this is what the movie should be about.
</P>
<P>
   Although she doesn't hear her own screams, Haines does recognize
the movie's other two strengths: the beauty of Williams and the
charisma of Chayanne.
</P>
<P>
   The singer and actor will make some young hearts in the audience
find that dancing beat. He has enough screen presence to deserve a
shot in a good movie. This isn't it.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't care for what dancing there is, the movie offers
two Hollywood oddities:
</P>
<P>
   _Kristofferson has two movies opening on the same day _ ``Dance
With Me'' and ``Blade _'' which is at least one too many.
</P>
<P>
   _The dance movie ``The Tango Lesson'' featured a takeoff on Gene
Kelly's famous dancing-in-the-rain number. So does ``Dance With
Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rated PG, ``Dance With Me'' contains minor profanity and the
unchildlike sensuality of the dancing. 2 stars. &QL;

CITIZENS HOPE TO SAVE OLD SAN FRANCISCO STREETCAR BARN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Preservationists are urging the city to save a
97-year-old Municipal Railway building that is a recognized
historic landmark, but which the transit agency wants to raze to
make way for streetcar and auto parking.
</P>
<P>
   The red-brick Geneva Car Barn at the corner of San Jose and
Geneva avenues was declared San Francisco's 180th historical
landmark in 1985 and is eligible for listing on the national
Register of Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so little to start with, that to think we'll lose this
is something that really upsets me,'' said Carol Ann Taylor,
founder of Neighbors of the Excelsior. ``This building is
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor and other preservation activists say they are busily
contacting city supervisors and the mayor's office in an effort to
save the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son remembers going there to buy his (street) car tickets
all the time,'' said Tony Sacco, president of the New Mission
Terrace Association. ``To tear it down for what they plan to do is
terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   If the plans are carried out, the Geneva Car Barn would be the
first designated landmark in San Francisco to be razed.
</P>
<P>
   Once used as office space and storage for antique streetcars,
the two-story structure has been vacant since the 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   The Municipal Railway, or Muni, says it cannot afford the
estimated $4 million it would take to repair and seismically
retrofit the building, which is rife with cracked bricks, moldy
stairways, broken windows, peeling paint and the accumulation of
pigeon droppings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely had looked at that (restoration) early on, but
had made a determination it wasn't fiscally feasible in the next 10
to 20 years, and we had more immediate needs for parking for the
old cars,'' said Nancy Whelan, Muni's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Muni officials asked the Planning Department to begin an
environmental review process, which is a necessity anytime changes
are proposed for a landmark. The process has been under way since
September 1997, and a draft report is expected to be released
sometime next month.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a hearing on the draft report and another when it
is finalized. Planning Department staffers will then offer a
recommendation to the Planning Commission, as will the Landmarks
Preservation Advisory Board. A final decision on the fate of the
last physical reminder of San Francisco's first electric railway
company will be made by the commissioners after those hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The office building and powerhouse that still stand on the
property were built by sugar magnate John D. Spreckels in 1901,
after he took over the fledgling railroad.
</P>
<P>
   Its Romanesque design boasted elegantly arched entrances and
windows, slanted wooden bays and a rounded Queen Anne turret on one
side. Shiny, solid wood paneling lined the hallways. When it was
built, fields of cabbage patches surrounded the building, and no
paved streets were anywhere in sight.
</P>
<P>
   David Bahlman, executive director of the Foundation for San
Francisco's Architectural Heritage, said the building is in as bad
a shape as it is today because Muni allowed it to deteriorate for
years before the earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called demolition by neglect,'' he said. Decayed, rusted
drainage gutters resulted in water damage that cracked many of the
walls, and aging beams and masonry were never repaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's been done here in the last 30 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency found in 1996 that the
unreinforced masonry building ``retains exceptional integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Bahlman hired an architect and engineer to visit the site for an
independent assessment a few weeks ago, and the assessment was
similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not beyond repair,'' Bahlman said. ``The foundations are
very, very solid.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HERSHEY, Pa. _ A girlfriend once sent me a greeting card with
the message, ``I love you almost as much as chocolate itself.''
After some pondering _ and a handful of chocolate chips _ I
resolved to take it positively.
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate, after all, is life's deepest, most addictive, gooiest
pleasure: chocolate bunnies on Easter morning, miniature bars in a
Halloween bag, a chocolate malt on a sizzling summer day, hot cocoa
after skiing. Whenever, wherever that sinfully fattening brown
nectar oozes over one's taste buds, life is good. Complete. Yes,
rich.
</P>
<P>
   So imagine my consternation several months ago when I read a
news account about the world's impending chocolate shortage. In
equatorial zones across the globe, it seems that fungal and viral
diseases and icky little insects are attacking cacao trees, whose
beans are the raw material from which chocolate is made. The crunch
may hit as soon as five years.
</P>
<P>
   Uncharacteristically, I was moved by more than self-pity. I have
two sons, Roy, 10, and Guy, 8, whose happiest moments are marked by
chocolate syrup smeared on their faces. So it was with a heavy
heart that I convened a family conference around our kitchen table
to tell them they faced an empty life. Just at the point I was
venturing the suggestion that cigarettes might eventually fill the
void, my wife, Suzanne, jumped into the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   She said the world would never let chocolate disappear.
Moreover, she said chocolate is a state of mind, like Christmas.
She knew this, she said, because in her peripatetic Army brat
youth, she had once lived near the capital of chocolate, Hershey,
Pa. She said the street lights there are Hershey Kisses, the main
intersection is at Chocolate and Cocoa Avenues, and the air itself
smells of chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Yes! We sent for tourist literature, and almost before a certain
substance might melt in your mouth, we struck out. We were headed
for a destination the literature called ``the sweetest place on
earth.''
</P>
<P>
   As carless New Yorkers committed to the notion that someone else
can do the driving, we took the subway to Penn Station and the
train to Harrisburg. There, we were picked up by a van from Hershey
Lodge, where we had reservations. The service is included in a
two-day package that includes admission to Hersheypark, the
amusement park that chocolate built; the Hershey Museum, and the
Hershey Gardens. There is also a free shuttle bus to the
attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Our very first impression that night was profoundly
disappointing: the air did not smell of chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   But things picked up. Upon registering, Hershey Lodge gave each
of us a candy bar _ the classic milk chocolate slab _ with our room
key. The parking lot stop signs had Hershey Kisses on them, as did
each door. There was cocoa butter soap in the bathroom. On the
television was a channel devoted to the subject of our quest. The
first program was a history of chocolate, the next told about the
amusement park and its six roller coasters, while the third
conveyed the amazing tale of the Chocolate King, Milton Snavely
Hershey. In these magical environs, the founder's spirit rules, as
does his story.
</P>
<P>
   It Started With Caramel
</P>
<P>
   Hershey, as he is still called hereabouts a half century after
his death, landed a job in an ice cream parlor in nearby Lancaster
when he was 15, and found a home in the candy kitchen. Four years
later, he headed for Philadelphia to start a candy shop and failed.
He failed again in New York. This ability to bounce back was an
object lesson that I tried to point out to the boys.
</P>
<P>
   His creativity was another lesson, though cunning might be the
better word. Hershey returned to Pennsylvania and began to make
caramels. He did very, very well. In 1900, he sold his Lancaster
Caramel Company for $1 million but shrewdly reserved the right to
continue to sell chocolate. He had made the important observation
that children licked the chocolate off chocolate-covered caramels
and threw away the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll stake everything on chocolate,'' he pronounced.
``Caramels are a fad. The chocolate market will be a permanent
one.''
</P>
<P>
   And he matter-of-factly proceeded to learn how to make milk
chocolate, then a luxury good produced in Switzerland. In no time
at all, he had built a factory, named the town Hershey and built a
trolley system to bring milk and workers to the factory. A
byproduct was a mass-transit system that stretched for miles.
</P>
<P>
   The factory churned out tons of chocolate at prices the average
Joe could afford. Success piled upon success. Kisses began to be
made in 1907, and Hershey's soon became the world's largest buyer
of almonds, for its Almond Joy bar.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hershey was bound and determined to make the town
itself a model of benevolence for company towns. Houses were not
made in cookie-cutter molds and were priced so workers could afford
them. Hershey Park (it didn't become Hersheypark until 1971) was
established in 1907 as a picnic ground for workers. There were free
band concerts, vaudeville and before long, a carousel. Other rides
were added almost every year.
</P>
<P>
   But almost from the beginning, the park was a tourist
destination. Hershey persuaded the Philadelphia &AMP; Reading Railroad
to build a spur to bring excursions there. And in the sort of mix
of business and recreation that has become the touchstone of
today's society, the cute little town with the Hershey smokestacks
became an advertising tool.
</P>
<P>
   For years, each candy bar contained postcards of Hershey. (Candy
bars were bigger once.) Moreover, the company offered window
displays of its namesake town to store owners all over the country
as a promotional device.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the big man busily created his own legends.
When he walked through Hershey Park, he would pick up even the
tiniest piece of litter _ unless, of course, it was a Hershey candy
bar wrapper. Those, he would turn over so the label could be read.
</P>
<P>
   When he built an elegant Mediterranean-inspired hotel, he made
the dining room circular, so nobody would have a corner table. He
had noticed that people who tipped modestly ended up in such
gastronomic ghettos.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hershey's mansion was not remote; it was across the street from
the chocolate factory. At the suggestion of his wife, Kitty, the
childless couple devoted almost all their personal fortune to
caring for orphans on farms surrounding Hershey, an initiative that
the family's foundation continues, although today's beneficiaries
are not necessarily parentless.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast and Dessert
</P>
<P>
   The infomercials ended. It was bedtime, particularly as the only
feasible alternative was clearly the Cartoon Network. It was then
we experienced our second disappointment: no York Peppermint Patty
on the pillow. I had sort of expected it.
</P>
<P>
   Upon waking up, we were thus especially eager to get to
breakfast in the lodge's Lebbie Lebkicher's Eatery and Pub, named
for a man who lent Hershey some money after one of his failures. It
is decorated with old posters for nickel-and-dime candy bars. The
waitress asked the boys whether they wanted chocolate milk or hot
chocolate. She gave them crayons in a tin candy container.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to eat more chocolate than you've ever eaten in
your life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   I had coffee and four succulent chocolate muffins, but the
children ate healthily. To be sure, the waitress had point-blank
refused Guy's request to give them plates of whipped cream. A
Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, with a human inside, came by. Guy said,
``It's fun shaking your favorite candy's hand, right, Dad?''
</P>
<P>
   After grabbing a handful of free Hershey Kisses for the road, we
waited in front of Hershey Lodge for Suzanne's flute teacher, who
lives nearby and with whom she has kept up all these years. The
hotel is oriented to families and conventions, and had seemed more
our kind of place than the hilltop Hotel Hershey across town. This
was not just because it is cheaper, but because it also had
miniature golf, several swimming pools and a video arcade.
</P>
<P>
   A friendly crowd. There were lots of people in Nascar and
motorcycle T-shirts; a huge woman wearing an ``I'm a chocoholic''
tank top; a couple with triplet babies in a single stroller, and
people carrying five-foot-high stuffed animals they had obviously
won at the amusement park. Pointing to the prizes, Roy gasped,
``Those kids are talented, Mom.'' (He believed this deeply, it was
to emerge in tearful moments later on.)
</P>
<P>
   Youthful Memories
</P>
<P>
   But before visiting Hersheypark, we went for a ride with
Suzanne's teacher, Bish, and her husband, Karl. Suzanne's four
years in a nearby town, Cleona, seven miles down the road from
Hershey, was the longest she lived anywhere as a child. We saw her
high school and other required sights We also went to places to
sample fresh-made soft pretzels and Lebanon bologna.
</P>
<P>
   Most compellingly, we marveled at the chocolate factory, with
the giant logo Hershey Cocoa spelled out in shrubbery, as well as
the towering silos full of cocoa beans. We saw Hershey Hotel, with
the magnificent fountains and stone lions in the lobby, and the
stunning gardens outside. Reverently, we paused at the intersection
of Chocolate and Cocoa and whiffed the air wafting over from the
factory. Yes, Virginia, it smelled divinely of chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   What was once the centerpiece of a Hershey visit, a factory
tour, has not been offered for years. Suzanne remembered seeing
huge vats of bubbling chocolate and savoring a chocolate milk on
factory tours of her youth. By the early 1970s, the tour was
drawing a million people a year, ultimately making it too crowded
for the workers.
</P>
<P>
   The solution was Hershey's Chocolate World, a Disney-like tour
of chocolate, with visitors riding automated cars. The attraction
has just been spruced up in honor of its 25th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   For the brief ride, about 10 or 12 minutes, one sees the world
from the perspective of a cocoa bean. From being cut with a machete
in an unidentified rain forest, you are shipped in containers to
the Pennsylvania promised land for roasting, milling, refining and
any number of other things. A Donald Duck-sounding voice provides
commentary. The cars never stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``So cool, man,'' Roy intoned as we went through the roaster
oven where the enveloping odor was you-know-what. The Hershey's
Kiss machine would have been anti-climactic, had it not been so
fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   The final message, from an eminently sincere recorded voice,
was: ``No matter where you go, no matter how far, you're always
near a Hershey's Bar.'' As if to prove it, you are then given a
free candy bar before exiting into a really big gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, you pass an expansive wall plaque with a lot of
names on little gold sheets. It is labeled the Hall of Fame of the
National Confectionary Salesmen's Association. That seemed
intriguing. Who were these men prowling the highways and byways of
America to bring chocolate to those in need? I'll never know,
because Roy and Guy had made a beeline for the gift shop. We raced
to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The best part of the shop was the giant made-to-order candy bars
they were selling that you could put any message on: ``Thanks for
watching the house,'' was the suggested one. I briefly thought of
provocative inscriptions I might have written to that long-ago
girlfriend, when my attention was suddenly seized by a toddler
stumbling by in a daze. ``Chocolaty, chocolaty,'' he kept
repeating.
</P>
<P>
   The Early Factory Days
</P>
<P>
   We each had a hot fudge sundae at an ice cream stand near the
gift shop. Then it was a short walk on to Hershey Museum, mostly an
eclectic collection of things Hershey picked up here and there _ an
American Indian section, Pennsylvania Dutch furniture, artifacts of
Victorian America and lots on the history of the Hershey family,
town and business. The Hershey stuff was best.
</P>
<P>
   Roy loved the re-creation of the factory locker room, where he
put on the chocolate-brown uniform of a worker and punched a time
clock. In the Discovery Room, the boys time-traveled to the 1800s
and pretended to buy things at a general store and cook on a wood
stove. What they liked best was playing checkers, a game that has
not changed. Parents sit on chairs at the edge of the room as
spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Intriguingly, a small exhibition hinted that things were not
always simple and easy, even in the world's sweetest town. In 1937,
there was a pretty brutal sitdown strike, the result of workers'
discontent with wages and an organizing campaign by the Council of
Industrial Organizations. The strikers shut down the plant and
barricaded themselves inside. Workers loyal to Hershey, local dairy
farmers and the American Legion fought with the strikers.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, neither the Council nor a company union got
bargaining rights. Hershey promised not to discriminate against any
participants. Chocolate town returned to cozy comfort.
</P>
<P>
   One wondered, though. One object in the display case, with no
accompanying explanation, riveted my attention: a wooden club with
a leather strap. And according to another exhibition at the museum,
life on the world's sweetest assembly line was relentlessly
demanding piecework. Payment on the ``Kiss line'' was a dime for 20
dozen Kisses.
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate Shake-ups
</P>
<P>
   The time for Hersheypark had come. Suzanne and I have kind of an
ambivalent feeling about amusement parks. It might be because
neither of us much likes spinning out of control at high altitudes.
Or it might be an aversion to seeing the rubes, particularly
ourselves, fleeced on the Midway. What we like about amusement
parks is the atmosphere, somehow nostalgic and challenging at the
same time. We like Coney Island. Sometimes we think we should take
the boys to Disneyworld, but we've never quite gotten around to it.
</P>
<P>
   Upon entering, we were measured to determine which rides we
could handle. Roy was tall enough to be a ``Twizzler,'' a Hershey's
candy that, alarmingly, contains no chocolate. That meant he could
ride almost anything. Guy was a Hershey Bar, which barred him from
a ride or two. Suzanne was ``Cookies `N' Creme.'' At 6 feet 3
inches, I was waved through.
</P>
<P>
   We began bravely enough by marching straight to the Comet, the
biggest roller coaster in the United States when it opened in 1946.
We waited in line for about 45 minutes, which is standard for most
of the big rides on the weekend. I rode with Roy. We screamed and
complained and promised to ride each of the park's other five
coasters, then somehow forgot to get around to it.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne and Guy found the experience sinister. She made Guy
close his eyes throughout the ride. She feared she was going to fly
out of the car, and sank so deeply into her seat her knees and back
hurt. She said it was awful. Guy let it be known that his teddy
bear (and alter ego), who had just been named Teddy Fudge in honor
of our expedition, would ride no more roller coasters. That meant
Guy wouldn't either.
</P>
<P>
   We soon found ourselves absorbed in the fantasy world of the
park. We drank big lemonades, lots of them, and ate popcorn and
cotton candy and funnel cake. Roy and I did a really great water
slide, Pistol Pete's Plunge, and also Tidal Force, a ride in which
you slowly climb a 100-foot hill in a 20-passenger boat, then shoot
down at a 43-degree angle to hit the water with an enormous splash.
The boys and I loved yet a third water ride, Canyon River Rapids,
which gives the experience of white-water rafting. But on a hot
afternoon, we had to wait for more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne and Guy tackled the Rodeo, an innocuous enough looking
ride compared with all the killer coasters _ particularly the new
Great Bear, on which riders sit in ski chairs with their feet
dangling down through 60-mile-an-hour corkscrew turns and
360-degree loops. But she was white as a sheet after revolving and
rotating, at the same time, on the Rodeo. Roy studied the map and
said, ``I've got a good ride for Mom _ the bathroom or the
telephone booth.''
</P>
<P>
   So it went, through two sunny days and one neon-seared night.
Fear, laughter and time moving at a little different speed. A
spectacular antique carousel went round and round and round. The
boys cried bitterly after unsuccessful tries at tossing balls in
milk cans and other Midway games, but were thrilled to win stuffed
animals when a barker could not guess either of their weights.
</P>
<P>
   They frolicked in the misting sprinklers the park has placed at
strategic locations. They laughed a little too loudly when a
toddler threw up his Twizzlers. At ZooAmerica, which began with
Hershey's personal animal collection and is included with admission
to the park, we walked on a bridge to a quieter, wooded world. The
animals are exclusively North American. We liked the bears.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, what to think? The experience is wholly commercial,
with every feature linked to promoting the Hershey image, or
occasionally other corporate sponsors who have rented space. What
is known as ``the sweetest parade on earth'' consists of 14
characters, each a trademarked Hershey's product, marching
triumphantly through the park shortly before dark. Having your
picture taken with one or another candy bar is one of everyone's
favorite activities.
</P>
<P>
   Well, why not? For better or worse, Hershey in this very place
made chocolate accessible to the masses. By definition, chocolate
is happiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we ate too much chocolate,'' Guy mumbled as we were
leaving, a Hershey's Kiss firmly in his mouth. ``But this  &UR; is &LR;  a
special chocolate place.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ No one can say that New York is outdoor
sculpture-challenged. If you travel around the city in summer, in
addition to the time-honored monuments that appear at every turn,
you will find many a newish work or works ensconced on temporarily
sites.
</P>
<P>
   The run this year is from celebrated talents like Auguste Rodin
and Tony Smith to a single quirky placement by the English sculptor
Rachel Whiteread in SoHo; from a playful show in the courtyard of
PS 1 in Queens to a more conventional convocation at Long Island
University's Brooklyn campus.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some suggestions of what to look for:
</P>
<P>
   One of the hardiest of the perennial outdoor shows flourishes at
Socrates Sculpture Park, a foolproof location on the East River in
Long Island City, Queens, where younger, less-established artists
are given room and support to flex their talents. ``Escape
Velocity'' is the title of the current offering, with 13 new works
planted around the park's refreshingly unmanicured four and a half
acres.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most site-responsive is Alissa Neglia's ``Lace,'' a
huge, ragged screen made from thousands of steel washers suspended
between two posts. Through it you get a dreamy glimpse of the
Manhattan skyline as if seen through a wall of frothy water.
</P>
<P>
   Also aimed at the opposite shore is Robert Hickman's ``Roosevelt
Island Shuttle,'' a frisky parody of the East River funicular. A
plain old wooden chair, mounted on an inclined rail supported by a
wooden trestle equipped with a dummy propulsion lever, it could
theoretically zoom its rider clear across the river (fortunately,
the lever is permanently braked).
</P>
<P>
   Other attention-getters include Bob Seng's ``Lost Hills,'' a
festive mounding of the fence around the park with streams and
rivers of multicolored materials; Wendy Klemperer's ``Fallen
Horse,'' a big steel skeleton of an upended steed, looming
vertically like a tower; Christopher Lesnewski's ``Bootleg,'' a
sardonic air-traffic control center ingeniously wrought of junk
parts, and Christine Koch's ``Cosmic Bosom,'' an open geometric
structure 30 feet high from whose apex dangles a cluster of bosomy,
phallic shapes unexpectedly fashioned of marble.
</P>
<P>
   An even more dramatic river site than Socrates is the
Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park, a hospitable patch of lawn and
trees strikingly situated on the Brooklyn waterfront between the
Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges.
</P>
<P>
   The show, ``Between the Bridges,'' sponsored annually since 1981
by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic
Preservation, is organized by the Brooklyn Artists Waterfront
Coalition, a loose-knit group that invites participation from
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The startling closeness of the bridges and the riveting skyline
have had their effects on several pieces in this hodgepodge of a
show. Among them are Daniel Bergman's ``East River,'' a tensile
structure of wood posts braced by steel pipes and strung with a
geometric web of cables that echoes the complex rigging of the
Brooklyn Bridge, and Wendy Carroll's delicate ``Energy River
Harvest,'' a long line of reedy-looking rods plugged vertically
into the riverfront bulkhead.
</P>
<P>
   The parklike aspects of the site are picked up by Lorraine
Walsh's ``Driver Ants,'' a steel picnic table whose zinc surface is
etched with images of marching ants, and Andi Kovel's ``Where Never
Is Heard a Discouraging Word,'' four topiary toadstool shapes
covered with grass.
</P>
<P>
   Also worth regarding are Sandra Salisbury's ``Dead City 3-D,'' a
cluster of small wooden houses translated from several paintings by
Egon Schiele; Matt Burke's ``Anger and Food,'' an interactive
complexity of three giant wooden spools that, when cranked, slowly
rotate to produce written messages, and Henner Kuckkuck's ``Gate,''
a powerful vertical composition of closely nested abstract steel
elements painted black. The site enhances all. Long Island
University
</P>
<P>
   A smaller show in a much more formal setting is the seventh
annual outdoor display organized by the Sculpture Center, a
nonprofit alternative gallery, at the Brooklyn campus of Long
Island University. Works by six artists are deployed around a
pleasant quadrangle near the main gate, cloistered from the clatter
of traffic on flanking Flatbush Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting idea here, although not the best executed,
is Heidi Schlatter's ``Interior No. 1, 2, 3, 4,'' four huge
blow-ups of tacky motel innards, each installed at ground-floor
level in an exterior niche of a prosaic brick building.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed from a middle distance, the images seem part of the
building's structure, creating the illusion that you are looking
into actual rooms. But they are skewed, perspectively and
otherwise, in relation to the building's dull facade.
</P>
<P>
   A more conventional but well-wrought sculpture is Arthur Weyhe's
``Untitled,'' a tall structure that suggests a skeletal wigwam
turned upside down. Five wooden spokes angle outward around a
vertical center pole, all painted bright red, all braced by steel
cables at the top and steel clamps at the bottom. The work has a
tidy, industrial look that doesn't belie its whimsicality.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Emily Feinstein's ``Gathering,'' an assemblage of mini-size,
Minimal-looking benches of raw wood, seems to imply a Shaker
meeting in which the benches themselves are the congregation, and
Jan Baracz's ``Shelter,'' a spare cubicle of yellow-painted wood
that is both a room and a passageway, nicely plays against the
glass and steel formality of the institutional edifices.
</P>
<P>
   Rising above the generation gap, Gelatin, a frolicsome group of
four Vienna-based performance artists, has turned the new ``outdoor
galleries'' (really an extended courtyard) of PS 1 Contemporary Art
Center into a loony romp-for-everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Attractions include a 25-foot walk-up tower made of discarded
furniture parts, a giant blue inflated teddy bear in perpetual
motion that looks like a refugee from the Macy's Thanksgiving Day
parade, and a ``refrigerator room'' of old iceboxes that makes a
summer day into an Arctic experience.
</P>
<P>
   Among other pleasures, you can also bask on a multilevel,
Mylar-covered sunbathing platform, disport in a sprinklered pool
with lots of inflatable toys, or take a sauna in a ``heating room''
made of corrugated tin.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Gelatin environment _ which also serves as a
setting for ``Warm Up,'' PS 1's disk jockey fests on summer
Saturday afternoons _ is more of a play than a sculptural
experience, the group should not be regarded too lightly.
Collectively, it has animation, city planning and stage design
credentials, and is apparently beloved in its native Austria. Take
the kiddies.
</P>
<P>
   It looks almost as playful as Gelatin's environment, but ``Under
the Sun: An Outdoor Exhibition of Light'' at the Cooper-Hewitt
National Design Museum has a somewhat more scientific motive: to
show the potential of solar energy.
</P>
<P>
   Several quirky-looking structures, each especially designed to
draw its working power from the sun, occupy the museum's handsome
garden. The most sculptural is the ``Solar Powered Tensile
Pavilion,'' a translucent tarpaulin 32 feet high and rigged like a
tent. Its fabric is bonded with thin devices that collect enough
solar output to power the mast lights. Easily taken apart, rolled
and relocated, the pavilion is designed as a movable shelter.
</P>
<P>
   But its taut, soaring presence is beautiful in itself; and
what's more, the structure acts as a sundial, casting a revolving
shadow that shows the time of day by pointing to markers on the
lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Another kind of sundial is made by a circle of 12 odd-looking
but quite sittable garden chairs, set in a circle on the lawn. They
are fitted out with solar-powered lights that signal seconds,
minutes and hours, and overhead canopies that can provide night
illumination.
</P>
<P>
   A third work is also a pavilion, a more modest-looking structure
of three eight-foot glass cubes. From solar energy, the cubes
generate electricity to run their own ventilation and lighting
systems. The works were designed by the architects Nicholas
Goldsmith and Gregory Kiss. Children might like this one, too.
</P>
<P>
   Small outdoor shows of two past masters, one of the 19th
century, the other of the 20th, are both projects of the Public Art
Fund, and appropriately, they've been given prime public spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Stroll along Rockefeller Center's Channel Gardens, the
flower-and-fountain lined promenade from Fifth Avenue to the
Skating Rink, and you'll encounter eight works by Auguste Rodin
(1840-1917).
</P>
<P>
   The formal site fits. Such familiars as ``The Thinker'' (1880)
and ``The Three Shades'' (1880), both deriving from Rodin's
unfinished monumental door ``The Gate of Hell,'' are here, along
with head and figure studies for ``The Burghers of
Calais''(1884-88).
</P>
<P>
   But there are others less well known, including the armless,
almost Cubistically distorted woman's figure, ``Meditation''
(1884-85), part of a monument to Victor Hugo, and _ in honor of the
painter James McNeill Whistler _ ``Whistler's Muse'' (1906),
portraying not his mother but an athletic nude Venus climbing the
mountain of fame.
</P>
<P>
   The sculptures were lent by the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor
Foundation, and they give a touch of class to the promenade, facing
as they do Paul Manship's stylized rendition of Prometheus covered
with glitzy gold leaf that serves as backdrop for the skating rink.
</P>
<P>
   The emotive realism of Rodin is a long way from the cool
Minimalist geometrics of Tony Smith (1912-1980), whose work is
fully explored in ``Tony Smith: Architect, Painter, Sculptor,'' a
current show at the Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   The Modern's garden has been emptied and restocked with Smiths
for the show's duration. The museum has also collaborated with the
Public Art Fund in placing three large-scale sculptures elsewhere
in midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Light-Up!'' (1971), at the Seagram Plaza, is a big polyhedron
painted bright yellow _ one of Smith's few chromatic sculptures.
Like most of his work, it reveals its complexities as you make your
way around it, but can never quite be seen as a whole. Vaguely
suggestive of a striding man, it has an open center that can be
walked through, in effect making a sportive entranceway to the prim
Seagram building.
</P>
<P>
   On the Doris C. Freedman Plaza, at the 60th Street entrance to
Central Park, sits ``Cigarette'' (1961), a sprawlier polyhedron
that also has a gateway effect, framing the archway that is the
``Scholar's Gate'' entrance to the park.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Quite different from these is ``Smug'' (1973), a ground-hugging
open-work structure of painted black steel whose mini-polyhedrons
are arranged in a repetitive overall pattern. Hunkered down on the
stair landing of the Avenue of the Americas entrance to Bryant
Park, behind the New York Public Library, it suggests a giant
tarantula waiting to spring.
</P>
<P>
   You have to look up to see Rachel Whiteread's ``Water Tower,''
perched on a SoHo roof. Cast in translucent resin from the interior
of an actual wooden water tank, it stands on its own steel frame
between two functional tanks, a ghostly maverick among them and the
thousands of other tanks that are a classic part of New York's
skyline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water Tower'' _ best seen from the southwest corner of West
Broadway and Grand _ can be distinguished by its refined, glowing
whiteness against the coarse brown exteriors of its siblings. Its
monolithic form, with three-inch walls, owes its shape to a
sacrificed East Side water tank.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Whiteread, a native of England, is noted for exploring the
sculptural possibilities of everyday objects. At first she did
mattresses, chairs, tables; then, in 1993, she made a cast of an
entire East London row house.
</P>
<P>
   The resin water tower, done as a commission from the Public Art
Fund, occurred to her on one of many walks around the city
searching for a sculptural motif. What a challenge the Chrysler
Building would be!
</P>
<P>
   A pair of engagement rings, three stories high with lighted
``diamonds,'' is Dennis Oppenheim's contribution to the city's
sculpture-scape. Right across from the Flatiron Building in
Manhattan, he has set up two skinny steel hoops embedded in
concrete, each precariously topped by a glass cabin whose -steepled
roof mimics the facets of a diamond.
</P>
<P>
   Each cabin is supported by a fragile galvanized steel structure
meant to evoke a Tiffany setting. Lighted up at night, they
simulate the glow and twinkle of high-carat stones.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheim, a Conceptual artist known recently for his jokey
installations on architectural and body themes _ among others _
achieved a larger balancing act last year with ``Device to Root Out
Evil,'' a mammoth work shown at the Venice Biennale.
</P>
<P>
   In it, red Venetian glass formed the roof shingles of an upended
country church, its steeple stuck at an ominous angle into the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ms. Whiteread, he seems to enjoy milking familiar forms for
sculptural possibilities. The solid old Flatiron Building should
give him a few new ideas. Robert Moses Garden
</P>
<P>
   One of the least-known mini-parks in Manhattan, the well-kempt
Robert Moses Sculpture Garden lies a flight above street level
right across from the southern end of Lincoln Center. A fine spot
to read and relax, its serenity has often been disturbed by
horrific sculpture shows.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to report, then, that David Boyajian's current
exhibition of 10 large-scale pieces, based on plant forms, rises
well above the usual dross.
</P>
<P>
   Made of mild steel whose skin forms a mellow rust, his
semi-abstract seed and bud shapes rest on columnar stems, the whole
expressing a stage of plant growth. The most impressive work is
``The Peach,'' a balancing act of volumetric half- and
quarter-circle forms perched atop a triangular shaft.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative is the word for these works, but they are real
sculptures, a welcome change.
</P>
<P>
   Walking in TriBeCa, you may suddenly come across Bill Barrett's
nine-foot-tall bronze sculpture ``Abstract Memories,'' which sits
quietly on a traffic island. A gestural work related to Abstract
Expressionism, its twisted, curving forms, part linear, part
fleshily biomorphic, suggesting both plant shapes and parts of the
human body, play happily off each other.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by the Nardin Gallery, Barrett's dealer, it is kind of
an old-fashioned notion to encounter on a TriBeCa street, but in
Barrett's hands, nostalgia works.

SALSA'S WOULD-BE SABADO NIGHT FEVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Randa Haines' likable mess of a movie ``Dance With Me'' wants so
desperately to be the ``Saturday Night Fever'' of salsa that you
can feel it huffing and puffing and straining its Achilles tendons
to try to detonate the same mixture of sex, alienation and
terpsichorean transcendence as the 1977 blockbuster that launched
John Travolta into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   But despite plenty of smoke and fire, the big liftoff never
arrives, and the climactic dance-contest sequence is a botched
fizzle.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring to fill the shoes of the young John Travolta is
Chayanne, a handsome, charismatic Puerto Rican pop singer and soap
opera star who is the epitome of a tenderhearted, smoldering-eyed
Latin American hunk.
</P>
<P>
   Chayanne plays Rafael Infante, an ambitious young Cuban who
moves to Houston after the death of his mother to work as a
handyman at a dance studio owned by an American named John Burnett
(Kris Kristofferson).
</P>
<P>
   John was a friend of Rafael's mother from the days when they
danced together on a cruise ship. A gruff, cynical loner who is
considering selling his studio and spending the rest of his life
fishing in the Gulf of Mexico, John may or may not be Rafael's
biological father.
</P>
<P>
   The question of paternity and the ambivalent bond between the
two men is one of several themes the movie bungles terribly in its
rush to cover too many dramatic bases too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The film's happiest surprise is the uninhibited performance of
Vanessa L. Williams as Ruby, a dance studio teacher and single
mother with whom Chayanne becomes instantly smitten. Ms. Williams,
who usually appears bland and buttoned-up in her films, explodes
joyously to life in the scenes in which Chayanne and Ruby tear up
the floor at a local salsa club.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Williams happens to be a superb dancer who consistently
eclipses her co-star in versatility, grace and joie de vivre.
</P>
<P>
   Chayanne is good at hoisting partners over his head, but as a
less balletic ballroom dancer he seems terminally earthbound. He
lacks the airy hauteur and kineticism of a human missile about to
take off that performers as diverse as Fred Astaire, Michael
Jackson, John Travolta and Patrick Swayze have brought to their
dancing roles.
</P>
<P>
   The movie insists that Rafael's untutored salsa dancing is
superior to Ruby's more elegant studio technique because it is more
``authentic,'' but the visual evidence suggests the opposite. Ruby
proves to be a much bigger influence on Rafael than he on her.
</P>
<P>
   And in the final dance contest sequence, set in Las Vegas, so
many different Latin dance styles are thrown together in such rapid
succession that any point the movie wanted to make about the rising
importance of salsa is dissipated in a confusingly edited,
suspense-free jumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dance With Me'' lacks the fluent, aloft-on-tiptoes momentum
that a dance-oriented movie must have in order to sustain a mood of
airy dreaminess. The dance sequences are awkwardly shoehorned into
personal stories that are too tentative and lackadaisically
developed to accumulate much weight.
</P>
<P>
   Ruby and Rafael are both adrift in the world. She is an Army
brat bringing up a young son who, like Rafael, is illegitimate.
While Ruby is agonizing over whether or not to reunite with an
abusive former partner with whom she stands a chance of winning
championship dance contests. Rafael is brooding about his
paternity, his future and whether or not he should return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The movie isn't helped by a wooden performance from
Kristofferson who squints so much he seems barely to be making eye
contact with anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Dance With Me'' disappoints on almost every level, it
still leaves you mildly elated, and its rich, percolating
soundtrack touches on a wide range of Latin American pop styles,
with Ruben Blades' song ``Patria'' a particular high point.
</P>

 &HT;    Savannah savoring its box of chocolates
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 23: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAVANNAH, Ga. Folks in neighboring South Carolina love to point
out that 85 percent of ``Forrest Gump'' was filmed in their state,
vs. only one really key scene here.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Because it's that Savannah scene, where Forrest (Tom
Hanks) watches the world go by from a park bench, that everyone
really remembers.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes in this coastal city so memorably dripping with
Spanish moss, cobblestoned squares and quirky characters that
filmmakers almost seem incapable of staying away. The credit list
here includes such mid-'70s schlock thrillers as ``Gator'' and
``Squirm,'' but the real glory days of Savannah moviemaking began
around 1989, when _ what else? _ the Oscar-winning ``Glory'' was
filmed in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, two big-studio features, ``The Gingerbread Man'' and
``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,'' were shot here. This
summer, two more _ ``The General's Daughter'' and ``Forces of
Nature'' _ are filming in the city at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes things a bit crowded in a place with 136,000
people and a layout that has to be considered unfriendly to
wide-turning movie production trucks. Many industry observers say
Savannah's stardom is largely attributable to its unique look _ as
compared with, say, Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the Savannah Film Office says that's true _ but
only to a certain extent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can be a lot of different things,'' said Jay Self, pointing
out that ``The Gingerbread Man'' was originally set in Memphis,
which looks quite different from Savannah. ``In `Wild America,' we
played Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas, and in `Forces of Nature,'
we're being any number of places between New York and Savannah.''
</P>
<P>
   But much like Forrest's box of chocolates, you never quite know
what you're going to get when a movie sets up shop in your small,
self-absorbed city. The success of ``Forrest Gump'' was a
double-edged sword for Savannah, said Self, with one faction of
residents thrilled by the economic impact it created via crew
spending and increased tourism, and another unhappy with the way
the film company seemed to ``roll over people in town.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of arguing about it ad nauseam, Savannah in 1995 used
$100,000 from the city's general fund to open the one-staffer film
office.
</P>
<P>
   Both Self and Georgia Film &AMP; Videotape Office director Greg
Torre say their offices have an excellent working relationship _
even exhibiting together at some large industry trade shows.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it's hard to argue with the success of a small city
that has its own film commission and which estimates that its 1998
moviemaking take will be $18 million to $20 million (compared with
$17 million in 1997 and $10 million in 1996.)
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves one to wonder: Can they ever make too many movies
in Savannah?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty much pushed to our limit with two movies in town
now,'' Self admitted. ``We couldn't handle a third.''

 &HT;    Film industry's team spirit helps revive glory days
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 23: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Savannah, Georgia, John Travolta and Ben Affleck are deep
into filming competing big-budget flicks for equally big-name
(Paramount, DreamWorks) studios. The feature film ``False River''
recently completed principal photography everywhere from Conyers to
Porterdale, and another TV movie, this one for TNT, has just signed
on to film in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   In metro Atlanta, production is about to begin on a Disney
made-for-TV movie about the civil rights march on Selma, Ala.
Cicely Tyson, Blair Underwood and Queen Latifah are already filming
``Mama Flora's Family,'' a CBS mini-
</P>
<P>
   series based on the book by Alex Haley (``Roots'').
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, good times are here again for Georgia's film industry,
which flourished in the early '90s, then slumped for a number of
reasons _ some of them self-inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   Now, says an older and wiser Georgia film community, it knows
what has to be done to restore the state as one of the primary
places for moviemaking outside Los Angeles or New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some growing pains,'' admitted Greg Torre, director
of the Georgia Film &AMP; Videotape Office. ``People were coming to us
for the longest time. Now, the whole thing is about us becoming
more proactive.''
</P>
<P>
   That sense of urgency has almost nothing to do with a desire to
gawk at the likes of the white-hot Travolta. It has nearly
everything to do with cold, hard cash. Since 1973, the state
Department of Industry, Trade and Tourism calculates that feature
movie and TV production has brought nearly $2.5 billion into
Georgia _ an estimated $247 million in 1997 alone.
</P>
<P>
   And just up Interstate 85, movies, TV and commercials pumped an
eye-popping $329 million into North Carolina's coffers last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was not a really good year for us,'' said Bill
Arnold, director of the North Carolina Film Office. ``In 1996, we
made 53 films here and $440 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia cannot afford to sit back and wait to field offers from
studios. Not when Canada's weakened dollar buys so much more for
Hollywood productions that set up shop there, or when North
Carolina goes to the Cannes Film Festival to sell the idea of using
its moving picture-perfect settings and experienced crew base. And
not when you consider how South Carolina whipped into action a few
years ago when it was learned that Barbra Streisand was seriously
considering shooting ``The Prince of Tides'' _ a book set in and
written by South Carolina resident Pat Conroy _ in, of all places,
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand needed three sound stages, so Beaufort-area leaders
decided to empty out all the surplus goods stored in a county
warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The local technical college made its gymnasium available,''
recalled state film office manager Isabel Hill, who also helped
facilitate Streisand's request to meet with Conroy. ``Then we went
to the National Guard and they agreed to reroute their weekend
training (to another facility) elsewhere in South Carolina through
the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was back in the early 1990s, when many of the
approximately 350 film commissions now vying for projects worldwide
didn't yet exist. The message hasn't been lost of late on Georgia's
film industry, where signs abound that they mean business when it
comes to increasing the state's film business.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Atlanta Production Partnership: Formed some 18 months
ago, this loose coalition of some 30 Georgia filmmaking entities
ranging from casting agents to lighting experts, meets monthly to
share information and strategize about bringing more projects to
the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that Georgia had had a competitive advantage that
was being eroded by other states developing their own equipment,
crew and production bases,'' said Partnership founder Steve Mensch,
who runs the Atlanta office of Feature Systems, a movie equipment
rental company. ``Let's say we hear a production is coming here to
scout (as a possible filming site). We can pull together a
Partnership meeting and build a consensus that we'll do a job and
make it happen. As far as I know, that's unique to us here.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Go West: For a long time, the movie business found Georgia.
Now with neighboring states, and places as far away as Canada,
proving much stiffer competition, Torre said, ``We're asking
ourselves, `What are ways that we can better market ourselves?'''
</P>
<P>
   One major response: The state film office recently awarded a
one-year consulting contract to Shay Bentley-Griffin, who'll
promote Georgia filmmaking directly to the decisionmakers in such
industry epicenters as Los Angeles and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``This truly was a brainchild of the (Atlanta Production
Partnership),'' said Bentley-Griffin, whose contacts in the
filmmaking industry go back to 1980, when she started out
representing performers. ``The group began to say, `We as an
industry have to find a way to come up with something that really
comes up with selling our strengths. And we also have to have a
body to get on plane and go to L.A. and talk at people!''
</P>
<P>
   -- Go Web: For years, the state film office has attended
festivals and trade shows _ ranging from the humongous ShowBiz Expo
West in L.A. to smaller events, like South-by-Southwest, which
Torre says provide ``a chance to meet up-and-coming directors and
producers'' who might film in Georgia someday.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop, cyberspace. South Carolina's film office has a
Website _ indeed, a mere click of the mouse calls up everything
from photos of suitable-for-filming Charleston slave cabins to the
time of sunset in Sumter in September _ so why not Georgia? While
the film office already has an Internet presence _ on the Industry,
Trade and Tourism department site (www.georgia.org) and a group
site for all Southern states (www.telefilm-south.com), Torre says
work is under way on developing a dedicated site capable of
transmitting location photos and information worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   -- What union problems?: Even the mere hint of union activity
can scare away some movie production companies, a message much of
Georgia's film community seems to have heard loud and clear. Both
Hilary Henkin, who represents the IATSE Local 479 of studio
mechanics here, and International Brotherhood of Teamsters' Local
728 secretary-treasurer Richard Black attend Production Partnership
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   And the spirit of cooperation hardly ends there. IATSE's
Southern locals recently developed a contract that allows
low-budget ($750,000 to $3 million), independent features to keep
upfront costs down in return for ``backend'' deals, Henkin said.
Meanwhile, a recent innovation allowing movie production
coordinators to decide which Teamsters will work on their sets
appears to be working out to everyone's benefit, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our (members) are looking for every opportunity to please the
coordinators so they'll work again,'' said Black, who also attended
Location Expo and ShowBiz West. ``I met a lot of producers there
who said they were hearing better things about the situation
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The need for such intensive soul-searching and strategizing
scarcely would have been imaginable back in the early 1990s, when
Georgia's film industry was literally laughing all the way to the
bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were so many movies being made here that a little joke
got started _ `I'd hate to be the fourth film shooting in
Atlanta,''' recalled Dawn Fields, an independent producer and
publisher of ``Back to One,'' a local film magazine. ``There were
only so much crew and resources to go around.''
</P>
<P>
   Now flash forward to the middle of this decade and an industry
that had been stagnant _ if not in actual decline _ for several
years. The half-dozen major feature films shot here in 1997
(``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,'' ``Scream 2,'' ``The
Gingerbread Man''), while an encouraging development, did little to
ease the minds of a film community haunted by memories of 1995 and
'96, when a total of three features were filmed in Georgia. And it
only began to approach the glory days of the early '90s _ in 1990,
seven TV movies and eight features were shot in Georgia, while 1991
saw a whopping 10 TV movies, four TV series and six features filmed
around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Observers point to myriad reasons for the drop-off in
moviemaking here, not the least of them being the more favorable
exchange rate and tax incentives available in Canada. Closer to
home, they say, North Carolina offers highly competitive prices and
a large studio complex built in Wilmington in the early 1980s by
producer Dino DeLaurentiis.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the situation helped by a perception of union activity
here several years ago _ a perception many admit had some basis in
reality, although they say the situation was never as bad as
Hollywood feared.
</P>
<P>
   And what's a state to do when its looks seemingly go out of
style?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trendy for awhile,'' said Henkin, who points to a
spate of ``rural Southern movies'' from ``Driving Miss Daisy''
(1989) to ``Fried Green Tomatoes'' (1991) filmed here. ``To a
certain extent, that group of film fell out of trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many here place the blame at least partially on Georgia's
film industry itself, for not noticing warning signs of decline
soon enough _ or coming up with a coordinated plan for combating
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of us in our own special areas marketed ourselves, which
we should have done,'' said Bentley-Griffin, the longtime
Atlanta-based casting agent who's worked on Georgia productions
ranging from ``Glory'' and ``Fried Green Tomatoes'' to ``Forces of
Nature'' and ``The General's Daughter,'' currently filming in
Savannah. ``As we got better, we didn't do much as a community.''
</P>
<P>
   But all that is changing now. Besides forming coalitions such as
the Production Partnership, the state's various film entities have
begun making a show of strength _ together _ at some of the
industry's largest events. For instance, the state film office has
long sent representatives to Location Expo, a mammoth trade show
that _ as the name suggests _ helps production companies big and
small learn about potential shooting sites. Yet for the first time
this year, their booth was flanked on either side by
representatives of the Savannah Film Office and the Atlanta
Production Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would talk to us about specific (Atlanta) locations, but
if there was something else they needed, I could steer them to the
Georgia booth or Savannah's,'' explained Henkin, who was in the
Production Partnership's booth. ``It sounds kind of trite, but when
the work comes in here, everyone wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. In the sort of ironically happy ending that usually only
happens in movies, Torre a few weeks ago revealed that Georgia was
very close to landing yet another major TV film.
</P>
<P>
   And what, exactly, had kept the producers from signing on the
dotted line so far?
</P>
<P>
   ``Their concern is, is there enough crew base here to service
them, what with all the other projects we've got going on,'' Torre
said, the grin on his face suggesting that this was the sort of
problem he liked dealing with. ``We're trying to convince them.''

what's supposed to be a bride's perfect day, things like that. Pupi
Avati's droll, melancholy ``The Best Man'' goes for something a
little more focused and compelling. While behavioral humor and
surprise reversals play their parts in this handsome Italian period
piece, emotional specificity and a fine sense of a lost era's
attitudes are the film's most engaging qualities. By Bob Strauss. 
. 
ERNEST-MUSIC (Los Angeles) _ We talk with pioneering Jamaican jazz
guitarist Ernest Ranglin, whose career has straddled several
continents. His latest release, ``In Search of the Lost Riddim''
pairs him with Afro-pop star Baaba Maal. It's a natural bridge for
an artist whose session work with Bob Marley, Prince Buster, Lee
Perry and Millie Small in the 1970s helped define reggae/ska. By
Fred Shuster. 
. 
POP-BEAT (Los Angeles) _ Dr. John can't recall having had more
arguments while cutting an album in his entire 30 years in the biz.
``We fought about everything, but I think the record turned out
pretty good in the end,'' the New Orleans-bred pianist and singer
says about his ``Anutha Zone'' LP. By Fred Shuster. 
. 
DISCS-MUSIC (Los Angeles) _ Korn is the Rodney Dangerfield of
noxious hard rock _ they get no respect. Not that these nitwits
deserve any. The Huntington Beach quintet creates the sort of
repulsive one-dimensional noise that makes a gasoline-powered leaf
blower sound like a string quartet. By Fred Shuster. 
. 
KUNDUN-VIDEO (LoS Angeles) _ Not long into ``Kundun,'' a film about
the early life of the 14th Dalai Lama, you begin to wonder if
Martin Scorsese made the movie as form of atonement. Or maybe the
director of such gut-wretching, violent films such as ``Mean
Streets'' (1973), ``Taxi Driver'' (1977), ``Goodfellas'' (1990) and
``Casino'' (1995) choose to tell the story of the nonviolent,
spiritual leader of the Tibetan people as a way of assuring that he
wouldn't be reincarnated as, say, a rock. By Rob Lowman. 
. 
RATPACK-TV (Los Angeles) _ Ray Liotta likes to joke that playing
Frank Sinatra in HBO's ``The Rat Pack,'' which premieres at 9 p.m.
Saturday, was cake. ``I have blue eyes. I'm from New Jersey. Close
enough,'' he says. But playing Francis Albert, 'Ol Blue Eyes, the
Chairman of the Board, was a daunting task for Liotta. By Keith
Marder.

 &HT;    Cult classic gave Torre his start; now he sells filmmakers on
state
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's got the corner office now, the one with the James Dean
photograph on one wall and the nice view of Peachtree Center 10
floors below.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Greg Torre confessed recently, the job's not all perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days I miss the ability to run away from problems,''
Torre said with a smile. ``Yo
</P>
<P>
   u know ... just heading out to different locations.''
</P>
<P>
   That's mostly celluloid fantasy now that Torre is six months
into his job as director of the Georgia Film &AMP; Videotape Office.
Charged with promoting the entire state as an on-location filming
site, the 40-year-old Toco Hills resident's tasks include
everything from nurturing Hollywood creative types to running a
five-person office that answers to state government (it falls under
the jurisdiction of the Department of Industry, Trade and Tourism).
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the onetime movie set location manager (``The Mosquito
Coast,'' ``Stars and Bars'') still gets to spend plenty of time
scouting potential movie locations in his current position.
</P>
<P>
   The demands of his job may have grown. But so have the potential
payoffs for Georgia's movie industry.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when Paramount recently couldn't secure Department
of Defense permission to shoot the John Travolta thriller ``The
General's Daughter'' on an operating military base, the Film &AMP;
Videotape Office swung into action. Torre and company had already
spent nearly a year working on bringing the film to Georgia _ now
they tried to find just the right base ``stand-in.''
</P>
<P>
   Photos were sent out and the filmmakers were brought in to look
at, among other places, North Georgia College &AMP; State University in
Dahlonega, Spelman and Morehouse colleges in Atlanta and Central
State Hospital in Milledgeville. Torre even arranged a research
visit to Fort Benning near Columbus for the filmmakers, who later
went on to scout in the Savannah area. The upshot? Travolta and
crew have spent much of the summer filming on the campus of
Savannah State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of time, (filmmakers) don't know exactly what they have
in mind,'' Torre explained with a slight grin.
</P>
<P>
   And to think it all started with an innocent trip to the local
laundry. That's where the University of South Carolina graduate
found himself in the early 1980s, armed with a load of dirty
clothes and a B.A. in journalism, with an advertising/public
relations concentration. There, he met an art director on ``Swamp
Thing,'' and instead of going on to graduate school in public
health, Torre got his first film job as a set dresser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent two months in the swamps,'' Torre said of his stint on
the Wes ``Scream'' Craven cult favorite. ``We made it look extra
swampy.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``best time I ever had on a movie'' turned into a career
choice for Torre. He spent the next six years serving as everything
from famed producer Ray Stark's assistant on ``The Slugger's Wife''
(``I went to New York as his driver. I had never driven in New
York. That's when I started losing my hair.'' ) to third assistant
director on ``The Lords of Discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, a field representative's job opened up in Georgia's
Film &AMP; Videotape Office, and Torre applied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see what it was like to have a life,'' explained
Torre, who gradually worked his way up through the ranks to
assistant director of the office. ``You know _ pets, stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet stable doesn't exactly describe Georgia's film industry of
late _ a fact about which Torre is refreshingly candid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had several very slow years,'' he acknowledged. ``We
realize L.A. doesn't have to come here (to film) anymore. We have
to make them see very clearly the benefits of coming.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone can do it, many in Georgia's film industry believe,
it's Torre. Indeed, when longtime film office director Norman
Bielowicz resigned, the Atlanta Production Partnership circulated a
petition supporting Torre for the top job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hard-working, personable; he has so many contacts, and
he's able to explain to them (film industry representatives) about
all the changes we're making here,'' Richard Black,
secretary-treasurer of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters
Local 728, said of the man he's seen in action in meetings and at
trade shows. ``One of the most instrumental reasons for the
industry growing here again is Greg Torre.''

 &HT;    Teen idols still make 'em swoon
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 30 years ago, 19-year-old Peter Noone (Herman of
Herman's Hermits) wrote this open letter published in the March
1967 issue of 16 Magazine:
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere in this wide, wide world there is a girl waiting
just for me. I believe this with all my heart _ because, you see, I
too am waiting ... waiting for her. So far, I haven't even laid
eyes on her, but I know exactly what she looks like. And I know
exactly what she is like _ because this is the girl I love; this is
my bird.''
</P>
<P>
   To millions of preteens, there was no doubt: The baby-faced
British pop star was looking for them. When he sang ``There's a
Kind of Hush,'' it was a personal message about ``just the two of
us, and nobody else.'' That wink into the camera on ``The Ed
Sullivan Show'' meant Noone was dreaming of a simple, ordinary girl
_ just like the ones who had his picture on their bedroom walls,
ate sandwiches out of his lunchbox and scribbled his name on their
school notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Noone's ``bird'' is pushing 50 now, but she apparently
hasn't forgotten Noone. Or Davy. Or Bobby. This summer, Noone,
along with Davy Jones of the Monkees and fellow late-'60s pop
heartthrob Bobby Sherman, is packing midsize music halls with
middle-aged fans (and their children) who still squeal, giggle and
grab for autographs at the Teen Idols Tour, which rolls into
Peachtree City on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Calling from the coffee shop of the AmeriSuites Hotel in Grand
Rapids, Mich., Noone makes a confession:
</P>
<P>
   ``I never wanted to be a teen idol,'' he says. ``I wanted to be
a rock 'n' roll singer. Teen idols were cute guys like Fabian, who
was walking down the street when some record producer drove by and
said, `You'd make a great rock star.' I had sold 20 million records
before anyone ever saw a picture of me.''
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to magazines like 16, Noone, Jones and Sherman became
icons to little girls throughout America, their good looks soon
eclipsing their music. And Noone says today that he's come to an
epiphany: That's OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really want to stop being Herman,'' he says. ``I
explain that to Davy all the time. Think of it this way. When you
think of Yul Brynner, what do you think of? `The King and I,' of
course. Sure, he did other stuff. But that was his hit record. I
knew it wouldn't last; I knew that back when I was 16. You become
the flavor of the month. But, you know, we did some good work. We
have an obligation to give the people what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Noone, Jones and Sherman (who hasn't toured in 20 years) roll
out the hits in a free-form show that changes from night to night.
Noone, the headliner, says that often it's Sherman who gets the
biggest audience reaction. For the past decade, the one-time star
of television's ``Here Come the Brides'' has been out of the
limelight, working as an emergency medical technician.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grown women scream,'' Noone says. ``They're relieved when
Bobby comes out because he still looks like Bobby. If he came out
drunk and fat and said four-letter words, it would completely
destroy the energy stored in their vault of memories as to what he
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Noone believes that the massive teen-idol phenomenon of the '60s
would be hard to duplicate in today's multimedia age.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you watch somebody in a video 100 times, you move on.
Remember, back then, TV appearances and records were events,'' he
says, adding that the immediacy and control provided by VCRs,
videotape and dozens of cable TV channels today have put once
nearly unattainable artists ``in your lap.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Noone and daughter Natalie, 10, recently caught a
Herman's Hermits performance on an old segment of ``The Ed Sullivan
Show'' on VH1.
</P>
<P>
   ``She thought it was fantastic,'' he says, ``but it also
embarrassed her a bit _ it was in black and white.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Rocker Rod Stewart remains master showman after all these years
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let us now praise the Lad Eternal.
</P>
<P>
   A rock 'n' roll archetype from the days when they still minted
originals, Rod Stewart is, and ever was, a primary role model for
every strutting bad boy who followed in his footsteps. He even
anticipated Robert Plant, if you can believe that now, when Stewart
fronted guitar god Jeff Beck's group in the late 1960s, wallowing
in those dirty, amped-up blues. The former gravedigger and semi-pro
soccer player rose to prominence shortly after, making his name at
the advent of the '70s, the same era as Neil Young, David Bowie,
Bryan Ferry (Roxy Music) and Elton John. But he quickly established
himself as a far, far rowdier rooster. Bowie and Ferry flaunted a
slicker, more sophisticated and sexually ambiguous appeal, one
draped in designer silks and fin de siecle ennui. Young was a
hippie cowhand who stomped like a renegade, far too earthy to
aspire to rock idol worship. John was a peacock who let his
costumes do the talking.
</P>
<P>
   Rod was Mod.
</P>
<P>
   And he was more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stewart, even in front of tens of thousands, projects an
ex-athlete's warmth, sets up towel-snapping camaraderie among the
players, and somehow manages to embody both the extrovert,
one-of-the-boys hi-jinks of the macho carouser and the introvert,
aw-she'd-probably-never-notice-me-anyway self-consciousness of the
shyest kid on the block. Even as we envy his outgoing, big-winner's
style, we revel in the knowledge he provides via self-mockery that
he can lose as often and as badly as we do.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Paul Nelson writing in 1976, in the first edition of
the ``Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock &AMP; Roll,'' which,
when I was 18, possessed an almost Talmudic authority over all
things amplified. Twenty years go by, and you begin to get wistful
for such complexities of performance, for someone who could sing
the line ``Combed my hair a thousand different ways / Standin' in
front of the mirror'' and make of the words a perfectly observed
moment, an instance of exposure glimpsed and then gone.
</P>
<P>
   The memory of that is compensatory. If we have to blame Stewart
for visiting the likes of Black Crowes vocalist Chris Robinson upon
us, for paving the way for every skin-and-bone rawk dude to gyrate
and hip shake, gripped by that peculiar strain of Saint Vitus'
dance that works only if the victim wears leather pants, well, then
we have to blame him. He can take it. He'll take it as a tribute.
He'll take it because every time he does, he knows that it means
rock 'n' roll would never have been the same without him.
</P>
<P>
   But wait a minute. Rod's not dead yet. I mean, he's 50 _ or is
he 53? He's at that peculiar time in life when we begin to ask of
our rock stars: Can they still rock? Septuagenarian blues guys with
missing teeth and a bum left leg never get asked that question. The
older they get, the more they rock. Jazz? Same thing. I bet when he
was onstage a mere month ago, nobody was asking Benny Waters, the
alto saxophonist who just died at 96, if he could still swing.
Bluegrass fiddlers don't take that guff.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that those forms are all based on traditions that
thrive on mastery, not novelty. Rock absorbs those traditions in
various ways, but is, as a form, obsessed with youth culture, with
new blood. Which is why, although Mick Jagger continues to make
records and tour and appears to be as athletic as ever, new kids on
the block like, say, Oasis seem somehow more startlingly relevant
to life and how we live it.
</P>
<P>
   OK. Not terribly relevant. You get the idea, though. The Rolling
Stones are history. Oasis is a headline. The object, once you've
become the former, is to also continue to be the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Young, wild-eyed galoot that he is, pulls it off _ even
though Beck seems to have inherited his mutton-chop sideburns.
Bowie? If wishing made it so. At least he's brave enough to make
albums no one wants to listen to.
</P>
<P>
   Rod doesn't have that problem: His latest CD, ``When We Were the
New Boys'' (Warner Bros.), is about to crack the Top 100 on
Billboard's album chart. Lo and behold, he's covering songs by ...
Oasis! The fans are out there, tuned in to VH1, no doubt, and not
overly concerned that Stewart hasn't made any music as revelatory
as his very best since, oh, the turn of the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   That pivot in his career is easily marked by his descent from
the emotional complexities of the epic ``Every Picture Tells a
Story'' to the cheesy sleaze of ``Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?'' It's the
difference between being a young Turk and singing ``Young Turks,''
while a real young Turk _ Paul Westerberg of '80s indie-rock
vagabonds the Replacements _ picks up on the wayward truths of your
most honest songwriting. (``Sixteen Blue,'' on the Replacements'
``Let It Be'' album, may be the greatest Rod Stewart song Stewart
never wrote.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Those first four or five albums were phenomenal, phenomenal,
and then he kind of went into the shtick,'' says Mark Kemp, former
music editor of Rolling Stone magazine and now vice president of
music development for MTV. ``Where he got lost was where he
continued to try and be hip or got bad advice from people who
didn't know what made him tick. There was a desperate attempt to
keep up with the Stones, then he kind of floundered. Not
commercially; his fans loved him, people went to hear the old songs
and he got off on that. He's a star, I mean a real star, in the
old-fashioned sense, (for) that generation that felt their stars
would never turn into Frank Sinatras, the kind of star that
continues doing those songs. You know, `Thank you, thank you very
much. I wrote this one in 1957. ... ''
</P>
<P>
   No sin, that, after all. ``He's a master showman, man, and he
still lives up to that standard,'' says Z-93 radio personality
Willard. ``You can't argue with a man who just set the highest
ticket price ever at the Hollywood Bowl: $150 a ticket!''
</P>
<P>
   That's champagne payback for a guy who started life on a beer
budget. Stewart's concerts are swoonfests for the females, rousing
pub crawls for the guys, rife with sing-along medleys and old video
clips and songs that emphasize the performer's strongest suit. The
old rasp in his throat is holding up pretty well, and makes Stewart
a still viable white soul-stirrer. He can evoke the spirit of Sam
Cooke with real panache, and, occasionally, even the echo of
himself, combing his hair a thousand different ways.

 &HT;    Years fade away as bands become soul mates
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems that getting older as a rhythm-and-blues performer is a
lot harder than if you spent your best years playing rock 'n' roll.
Long after the Rolling Stones had a really big hit, they still sell
out the 70,000-capacity Georgia Dome. R&AMP;B artists of comparable
stature do well to fill the 6,000-to-8,000-seat spaces.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it seems that things are changing. Classic soul formats,
such as the one on Atlanta radio station WAMJ-FM (107.5), are
gaining momentum across the country. Which indicates that there is
still a sizable audience for old Motown and soul music of that era.
Even the acts themselves are making adjustments, including those on
Sunday's bill at Chastain Park Amphitheatre:
</P>
<P>
   -- Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire has asked rapper and producer Wyclef Jean
of the Fugees to work on its upcoming album. ``I think it's a
perfect match, because I come from a musical sense that I think
would have been better appreciated in the time they were making
songs like `That's the Way of the World' and `Reasons,''' says
Jean. ``But since I wasn't fortunate enough to be born in their
era, I hope I can make people feel why they are still relevant in
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   On the strength of a voluminous catalog of classics
(``Reasons,'' ``Devotion,'' ``Keep Your Head to the Sky''), the
28-year-old EW&AMP;F continues to sell out amphitheaters every time it
tours. This is true even though co-lead singer/founder Maurice
White hasn't performed with the band in the United States in recent
years. And it's true even though EW&AMP;F hasn't had a really
big-selling album of new work since ``I Am'' (``Boogie
Wonderland,'' ``After the Love Is Gone'') in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Isley Brothers, particularly lead singer Ron Isley, are
making winning alliances with such urban contemporary acts as R.
Kelly (``Down Low''), Babyface (``Tears'') and newcomer Kelly Price
(``Friend of Mine''). In fact, Kelly refers to Ron Isley as ``Mr.
Big.'' It's a persona that Isley played up on his act's last album,
``Mission to Please,'' the first million-seller the current trio
has had in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't hurt either that our songs like `Between the Sheets'
and `Footsteps in the Dark' have been sampled by Biggie Smalls
(`Big Poppa'), Da Brat (`Funkdafied'), Ice Cube (`It Was a Good
Day') and all these rap folks,'' added guitarist Ernie Isley of the
25-year-old act. ``Then for R. Kelly to have Ron in his videos, on
his records, it's like a stamp of approval to the younger kids.''
</P>
<P>
   -- The O'Jays have had less success in terms of recent tours and
album sales. But samples from their 26-year catalog still propel
hip-hop (Big Pun, Queen Latifah) and R&AMP;B records. ``And when I did
the album with my son (Gerald), people responded incredibly well,''
says O'Jays founder Eddie Levert. ``They love to see and hear the
generations of singers. It didn't go platinum, or whatever the kids
say. But we know it meant something. So we're working with him to
write the kinds of songs that will hopefully speak to his
generation while still meaning something to mine.''

`RAT PACK' MOVIE LOOKS AT EXPLOITS OF FAMOUS FIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ray Liotta likes to joke that playing Frank
Sinatra in HBO's ``The Rat Pack,'' which premieres Saturday at 9
p.m., was cake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have blue eyes. I'm from New Jersey. Close enough,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   But playing Francis Albert, 'Ol Blue Eyes, the Chairman of the
Board, was a daunting task for Liotta.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he have to overcome not looking (eyes
notwithstanding) or sounding like the man he was portraying,
Sinatra is probably the most written-about entertainer of any
generation, someone who has appeared in dozens of films, released
scores of albums and had a career that spanned four generations. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; And, Liotta, who had considered Sinatra songs his parents'
music, had to capsulize one of the most-known figures of the 20th
century in a two-hour film.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra was The Leader of the Rat Pack, the most famous
entertaining troupe in history. It included suave balladeer Dean
Martin (Joe Mantegna), incomparable musician/singer/dancer Sammy
Davis Jr. (Don Cheadle), schtick-laden comic Joey Bishop (Bobby
Slayton), and vain British actor Peter Lawford (Angus Macfayden),
who was married to Patricia Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra becomes intoxicated with JFK's (William Petersen) style
and mends his relationship with Lawford to get on the inside of the
Kennedy camp. The skinny kid from Hoboken wanted to prove he was
more than a saloon singer. His goal: Lead Kennedy to the White
House, and then get an invite.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Liotta plays Sinatra to a manic pitch. There is
vulnerability and volatility; loyalty and lavish lifestyle; and, of
course, butts, booze and broads, baby.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, we see Joe Kennedy ask Sinatra to get gangster
friends such as Sam ``Momo'' Giancana to help fix the election. But
it's Sinatra's association with organized crime that eventually
makes him a liability to the Kennedys, Sinatra's ultimate downfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it in terms of a Greek tragedy,'' said director Rob
Cohen, ``in that Sinatra was undone by the very things that
Kennedy, for example, needed him to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Liotta, who had previously turned down the part of Sinatra for a
CBS miniseries, did a 180 and decided that this was a project he
could grab onto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out Rob didn't want to do the Joe Piscopo thing,''
Liotta said referring to the comic who is best known for his
Sinatra impersonation. ``When I read the script, I just looked at
it as a great character. I'm getting to play a guy who sings `One
for My Baby,' sleeps with Ava Gardner, goes sailing with JFK.
That's a great part.''
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriter Kario Salem, like Cohen, wasn't looking for a
Vegas-style replica act.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about the mannerisms and the sort of cartoon version
of who we think these people are,'' Salem said. ``It's about their
insides out. No one tried to impersonate these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Liotta still dug through miles of tape, stacks of discs and
reams of paper to find the real Sinatra. He took note of which hand
he held the microphone in (either), facial expressions and
mannerisms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' Liotta said, ``over one incident there's probably
seven to eight points of view. Now I know why people write
biographies, to set the record straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the actors had an individual challenge capturing their
well-known character.
</P>
<P>
   Cheadle, for instance, had to learn to tap dance, taking lessons
from choreographer Savion Glover, to play the drums and twirl a
gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gained a lot of respect,'' he said. ``I gained a lot of
insight. He wasn't anyone I either reviled or revered.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheadle, 33, had very little point of reference about Davis. He
knew him from the Mr. Bojangles/Candy Man era, and an occasional
guest stint on ``Laugh-In.'' He also knew of the photograph of
Davis hugging President Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before doing this, I always thought Sammy Davis Jr. was a
sellout. An Uncle Tom,'' Cheadle said. ``There was no place where
he stood up and said, `I know how I'm being treated, but I'm doing
it for a reason.' He looked like a pawn, a shuttlecock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thing was, though, he was a fighter. He made a decision to
become an undeniable talent and force. And through that, he got in
a lot of places and headlined a lot of clubs that wouldn't have let
him in as a patron. He was the Jackie Robinson of entertainers.''
</P>
<P>
   The film depicts Davis as a tortured artist. He winces after a
racist joke. His wife, May Britt, who was white, complains that he
is being laughed at by his so-called friends. And there is a
fantasy scene where he does a curdling version of ``I've Got You
Under My Skin'' to a batch of white supremists.
</P>
<P>
   Mantegna, the biggest Rat Pack fan of the cast, was familiar
with Martin and his style. It showed as Mantegna morphed into the
effortlessly cool style of Dino.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with all of those guys as a role model of cool for a
generation,'' he said. ``They lived in a time when we thought that
drinking and smoking was good for you.''
</P>
<P>
   As an Italian-American growing up in Chicago, Mantegna
especially looked up to Martin, whose first language was Italian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got uncles to this day who still think they are Dean
Martin,'' Mantegna said. ``He was somebody I admired and decided to
give it a whirl.''
</P>
<P>
   Slayton's stretch to play Bishop was probably the simplest. He
said that he has a lot in common with the only living member of the
Rat Pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could say, `Yeah, I spent months on the Joey Bishop
Diet,' that I did everything Joey did, hung out where Joey hung
out,'' Slayton said. ``Ray is a method actor and was really getting
into his part, getting himself all worked up. When people ask me if
it was hard playing a real-life person, I say, `Wait a second. I'm
43, which is pretty much the same age as the real Joey Bishop was
at the time. We're both from the Bronx, we're both Jewish, we're
both standup comics. We're not talking `Raging Bull' here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Slayton said that he was reluctant to speak to Bishop because he
heard he was bitter and wanted nothing to do with the project.
</P>
<P>
   They eventually spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said there was no way to recreate the swing era of the
'60s,'' Slayton said. ``Recreating five drunk entertainers chasing
broads and telling bad jokes is not that hard. Didn't Steven
Spielberg bring back dinosaurs? Didn't James Cameron put us on the
deck of the Titanic?''

</P>
<P>
   GOODBYE FOR NOW: ``American Cinematheque's Greatest Hits,
1993-1998'' enters its final weekend at the Raleigh Studios theater
before the lights go down for a four-month hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:15 tonight, the last remaining 35mm print of ``Twitch of
the Death Nerve'' (1971) has been secured. A mansion is the setting
for murder as 13 occupants turn on each other in this 90-minute
film by Italian frightmaster Mario Bava. At 9:15, director Robert
Wise's ``The Set-Up'' (1949, RKO), about a washed-up fighter in his
last bout, will be followed by Vincent Sherman's ``The Hard Way''
(1942), starring Ida Lupino as the overbearing sister who insists
to everyone that her sister is a movie star. Discussions with the
directors, both of whom will attend, take place between screenings.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, ``The Last Big Thing'' will be shown again at 7:15
p.m. Writer/director Dan Zukovic stars in this scathing 1996 satire
that takes aim at super-hyped modern media that's given us music
videos, supermodels and the sudden cultural affection for the '70s.
The director will attend and discuss his film. Four episodes of
Lela Lee's animated ``Angry Little Asian Girl'' (six minutes total)
will also follow.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:15, ``Sword of Doom'' (1966), from Japanese director
Kihachi Okamoto, and the spaghetti western ``Cemetery Without
Crosses from 1968 will close. ``Cemetery'' is actor/director Robert
Hossein's western about a killer drawn into a kidnap/murder plot by
love. Strangely, the story has little dialogue and is mostly
achieved through visuals.
</P>
<P>
   For program information, call (323) 466-3456. The Cinematheque
will reopen in early December at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood.

WHERE JAMAICA AND AFRICA MIX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; To cut his latest album, pioneering Jamaican jazz
guitarist Ernest Ranglin was drawn to Senegal.
</P>
<P>
   It's a country Ranglin had visited once before in 1976 as part
of Jimmy Cliff's band.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, although he'd traveled the world and studied
various musical forms, Ranglin yearned to return to Africa to
record with local musicians.
</P>
<P>
   During that first visit two decades ago, the guitarist met an
aspiring singer named Baaba Maal, now an international Afro-pop
star and Ranglin's labelmate.
</P>
<P>
   The two collaborated on ``In Search of the Lost Riddim,''
recently released by Palm Pictures, Island Records founder Chris
Blackwell's new label. Ranglin's latest effort _ his third album in
as many years _ blends the percussive sounds of West Africa with
Caribbean and pop influences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to align African culture with what we have in the
West,'' Ranglin explained. ``We've lost our roots. I tried to get
as close as I could to the source and then introduce what I learned
to this side of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ranglin helped shape the course of Jamaican pop music. Inspired
by the great jazz guitarist Charlie Christian, Ranglin worked in
Kingston's hotel bands of the '50s. These big bands taught him to
orchestrate and arrange music, and the constant touring introduced
him to musicians of various styles.
</P>
<P>
   Often credited as inventor of reggae's ka-chicka rhythm sound,
Ranglin played with members of the Skatalites before becoming
musical director of Duke Reid's influential Treasure Isle label in
1965. During the next five years, his choppy rhythms helped lead to
the development of rock-steady and reggae out of ska, which was
short for skavoovee, a popular catch-phrase at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Ranglin, awarded the Jamaican Order of Distinction in 1973,
played on cuts by Bob Marley, Prince Buster, Lee Perry and Millie
Small, for whom he arranged the worldwide smash ``My Boy
Lollipop.''
</P>
<P>
   The guitarist says he and other session hands had no inkling
they were making pop history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no idea to tell you the truth,'' Ranglin, 66, said the
other day. ``We were just doing what comes naturally. We hoped for
the best but didn't know it would come out as great as it did.''
</P>
<P>
   After cutting a series of hard-to-find solo albums in the '60s,
'70s and early '80s, Ranglin emerged in 1996 with the well-received
``Below the Bassline'' (Island Jamaica), a collection of original
instrumental grooves combined with jazzy covers of reggae classics
by Augustus Pablo, Toots &AMP; the Maytals and Burning Spear.
</P>
<P>
   A lyrical and inventive soloist, Ranglin sounds at times like a
Caribbean version of funk-jazz guitarist Phil Upchurch or a far
less mainstream George Benson.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ranglin released ``Memories of Barber Mack'' (Island
Jamaica), titled for a legendary local saxophonist and consisting
of 10 Ranglin originals along with interpretations of a couple of
reggae classics.
</P>
<P>
   As for the making of ``In Search of the Lost Riddim,'' Ranglin
recalls arriving in Senegal's capital city Dakar and having to wait
for the sessions to slowly come together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took some time for things to happen,'' said the guitarist,
who has homes in Florida and Jamaica. ``But I worked with some
fantastic musicians, and the studios are as modern as anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many reggae aficionados raised on the real thing, Ranglin
is discouraged by dancehall and other types of '90s Jamaican pop in
which drummers are replaced by machines and the famous rock-steady
pulse of reggae is reduced to a keyboard squeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in (electronic music) because nothing beats
live music played by people,'' he said. ``That's where you discover
a person's natural talent and rhythm. You can't play a drum machine
and make it sound natural. I can see using a keyboard for the sound
of strings. It's difficult to get a string section in most
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't believe in the rest. I need to hear natural
instruments. What happened to drums, bass, saxophone and guitar?
Things at home are going too far.''

KORN/``Follow the Leader'' (Immortal/Epic)
<TEXT>
<P>
   Korn is the Rodney Dangerfield of noxious hard rock _ they get
no respect. Not that these nitwits deserve any. The Huntington
Beach quintet creates the sort of repulsive one-dimensional noise
that makes a gasoline-powered leaf blower sound like a string
quartet. The band's predictably unlistenable new album _ which
kicks off on the CD's 13th track, so your player just sits there
burbling as it figures out what's wrong _ is a dreadful mishmash of
cliches you've heard a thousand times before. Lead singer Jonathan
Davis, who has suddenly developed an English accent, alternates
between a dopey sub-Slayer growl and a fey Village People-on-smack
dazed giggle. Just horrible _ and it's going to sell in the
millions. 1 Star. &QL;

   Snoop's cameos on Dr. Dre's ``The Chronic'' helped make that

Master P's factory, where every release sounds alike and they all
share nearly the same cover design, Snoop's lost his charm. There's
just nothing very special about the production talents of No
Limit's tepid Beats by the Pound, which offers little variety on
these tracks. Snoop's still got that trademark Long Beach drawl,
but without something more going on musically, it too often falls
flat. 2 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
DES'REE/``Supernatural'' (550 Music)
</P>
<P>
   London-based chanteuse Des'ree broke through about four years
ago. On her just-released third album, she's hit her stride with
soaring vocals, first-class material and strong arrangements
touching on pop, rock, reggae, folk and soul ballads. Best tracks
here include ``Life,'' a smart fusion of pop and soul; the sweeping
ballad ``I'm Kissing You''; the imaginative title track mixing
funk, reggae and folk elements; and the Caribbean-tinged ``Proud to
Be Dread.'' One of the most seductive soul-pop discs of the year. 3
Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SOUNDTRACK/``The Avengers: Music From and Inspired by the Motion
Picture'' (Atlantic)!off!
</P>
<P>
   Awful movie, so-so soundtrack. The companion disc to the failed
summer flick offers a mildly diverting sampling of such hot acts as
Annie Lennox, Sugar Ray and the Verve Pipe. Best of all is a Roni
Size/Reprazent drum 'n' bass track and two numbers from Ashtar
Command, a new project featuring members of Filter with vocal help
from Veruca Salt's Louise Post and Sinead O'Connor. There's also a
chilled-out reading of the ``Avengers'' theme from U2/Madonna
producer Marius deVries. 2 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
VARIOUS/``For the Masses'' (A&AMP;M)
</P>
<P>
   On this elegant tribute album to '80s pretty boys Depeche Mode,
the strength of Martin Gore's songs stands out. However, who knew
the band had this many high-profile fans? ``For the Masses''
features tracks from such diverse acts as Smashing Pumpkins, the
Cure, Veruca Salt, Hooverphonic, Gus Gus, Rammstein and others.
Among the best moments here are God Lives Underwater's ``Fly on the
Windscreen,'' Failure's ``Enjoy the Silence'' and Apollo 440's ``I
Feel You.'' 2{ Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
HANK MOBLEY/``The Complete Blue Note Hank Mobley Fifties Sessions''
(Mosaic)
</P>
<P>
   This six-CD package collects the music of tenor saxophonist
Mobley recorded at nine '50s sessions for Blue Note. The gutsy,
subtle and always-interesting soloist is accompanied by an all-star
cast that includes trumpeters Lee Morgan and Donald Byrd, pianists
Horace Silver, Sonny Clark and Bobby Timmons, bassists Wilbur Ware
and Paul Chambers, and drummers Art Blakey, Philly Joe Jones, plus
others. Despite such big names, the star of the show is clearly
Mobley, whose soulful, perfectly round tone puts across this varied
set of straight-ahead be-bop burners and low-lights ballads. Mosaic
releases are available by mail-order only. Call (203) 327-7111. 3{
Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CHRISTIAN McBRIDE/``A Family Affair'' (Verve)
</P>
<P>
   Bassist Christian McBride, just 26 years old, has played on more
than 100 recordings, including gigs with Diana Krall, Wynton
Marsalis, Kathleen Battle and Chaka Khan. It's easy to see why he's
in such demand from ``A Family Affair,'' a catchy pop-jazz album
full of terrific songs and inspired playing. Five of the 10 songs
here are McBride originals, including two with soulful vocals. The
remainder of the album features covers of such r&AMP;b classics as
Stevie Wonder's sensuous ``Summer Soft'' and the cover song, where
McBride's acoustic bass makes like Sly Stone's rough-and-tumble
voice. ``A Family Affair'' assimilates jazz, funk, soul and pop
into one delightful sound that grows more infectious each time you
hear it. Highly recommended. 3{ Stars. &QL; 
_ Glenn WHipp &QR; 
 &QL; 
WILLY LOBO/``Juicy'' (Verve)
</P>
<P>
   This is another treat from Verve's ``By Request'' series, which
takes long-out-of-print albums and repackages them at a budget
price. The great percussionist Lobo is in fine form here, training
his trademark, down-and-dirty Latin sound on party classics like
``Knock on Wood,'' ``Mercy, Mercy, Mercy'' and ``Shing-a-Ling
Baby.'' Every song settles into a shake-your-tail-feathers groove,
and if the album's 12 cuts aren't enough, the reissue includes four
alternate takes that are every bit as juicy as the originals. 3
Stars. &QL; 
_ G.W. &QR; 
 &QL; 
VARIOUS/``S'Wonderful: The Great Gershwin Decca Songbook'' (MCA)
</P>
<P>
   This compilation gathers what is ostensibly the cream of
Gershwin covers from the Decca catalogue, from Louis Armstrong's
1938 ``Love Walked In'' to Teresa Brewer's 1960 ``They Can't Take
That Away From Me.''
</P>
<P>
   You know these songs; you know these singers. In fact, you may
already own some of these recordings on vinyl or 78-rpm formats and
may be anxious to hear them free of the old snap, crackle and pop.
Yet despite the inclusion of stratospheric talents like Billie
Holiday, Helen O'Connell, Mel Torme, Judy Garland, Bing Crosby and
Peggy Lee, the Gershwins' masterworks gathered here aren't the
bounciest versions you've ever heard of these tunes. Except for
Sammy Davis Jr.'s performance of ``I've Got Plenty of Nuttin' ''
from his 1958 recording of ``Porgy and Bess'' with Carmen McRae,
and McRae's own '54 recording of ``They All Laughed,'' there's
little guts to be had among all this greatness. Ultimately, this
may be a better CD to own than to listen to. 2 Stars. &QL;

NEVER A DULL MOMENT IN SHINY `BLADE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN SCHOFER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking
of massive bolts . . . and the great door swung back. Within stood
a tall old man, clean-shaven save for a long white mustache, and
clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck of colour
about him anywhere. `` - Bram Stoker (``Dracula``) &QL; 
 &QL; 
UNDATED - A time-lapse sun plunges on the New York City horizon.
Full night follows as a beautiful girl leads a young man into a
trendy dance club behind a slaughterhouse. As the techno-pop
grooves resonate and the dancers reach a frenzy, the ceiling
sprinklers shower them with blood.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to a postmodern world of vampires that would give Bram
Stoker nightmares. It is a world in which vampires operate in a
secret nocturnal organization, sinking their claws and fangs into
every part of society: finance, real estate, law enforcement. They
roam the streets, hunting. They are everywhere. And they must be
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Blade, a daywalker: half-human, half-vampire. He wages a
virtual one-man war on the vampires in a stylish new thriller based
on the Marvel Comic.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Snipes plays Blade, the cool hero who speaks little and
packs plenty of weaponry. The days of a stake through the heart and
holy water are over. Blade eliminates vampires with everything from
an old-fashioned Samurai sword to an Uzi loaded with silver
bullets. Granted, silver bullets are usually associated with
werewolves, but the vampires of Blade have as much in common with
Bram Stoker's ``Dracula'' as the Oxford English Dictionary has with
a Speak-N-Spell. Gothic horror has given way to MTV.
</P>
<P>
   The story of ``Blade'' concerns a human-turned-vampire named
Frost (icily played by Stephen Dorff), who seeks to awaken the
vampire god and take over the human world. To achieve his goals, he
needs Blade's blood because it contains properties that would allow
Frost to move freely in daylight.
</P>
<P>
   Aiding Blade in the fight against Frost is Whistler (Kris
Kristofferson), a grizzled vampire-slayer who makes the weapons
Blade uses, and Karen (N'Bushe Wright), a hematologist bitten by a
vampire but saved from becoming one because of a serum that
suppresses the thirst for blood.
</P>
<P>
   The plot, however, serves merely as an excuse for the action and
is filled with about as many holes as one of Blade's victims. For
instance, about halfway through the movie we see Frost outside in
full daylight. How can a vampire do this? Why, with sunscreen, of
course. Yet the movie never explains how he is able to cover
(apparently) his entire body with enough sunscreen to keep from
burning to death.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the reason the vampires have become so powerful is due to
their ability to blend in. But in the same scene, Frost tosses a
child hundreds of feet through the air and onto a crowded street,
yet no one seems to notice. Nor is the child injured in any way.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Blade drives around in a souped-up jet-black 1968
Dodge Charger and dresses like Arnold Schwarzenegger in
``Terminator 2.'' This is blending?
</P>
<P>
   Still, the plot and gaps in logic seem unimportant to the
filmmakers (the movie ``is'' based on a comic book, after all).
Blade is about wasting ammunition, kung fu fighting, and racking up
dead bodies (enough to put Buffy to shame). Blade is style over
substance.
</P>
<P>
   Director Stephen Norrington to some extent used the movie to
test different film speeds. There's the time-lapse, which
compresses a day into minutes. There's slow motion. There's fast
motion (allowing the characters to run and jump and fight at high
speed). There's rapid-fire cutting. And all sorts of gruesome
special effects and makeup.
</P>
<P>
   The film never lapses into campiness and has the feel of a comic
book: ultra-violent, ultra-stylish and ultra-cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blade'' is rated R for excessive violence, strong language and
sexual situations. 3 stars. &QL;

DR. JOHN'S FIGHTIN' WORDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Things got a bit contentious during the making of
Dr. John's latest record featuring members of some of Britain's top
bands.
</P>
<P>
   The New Orleans-bred pianist and singer, whose real name is Mac
Rebennack, says he can't recall having had more arguments while
cutting an album in his entire 30 years in the biz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd fight about the groove and if it was slippin' or not,''
Rebennack drawled. ``Finally, we put the song to a click track and
saw we was slippin' way downhill.''
</P>
<P>
   The new album, ``Anutha Zone'' (Pointblank), includes
contributions from Paul Weller and Jools Holland, plus members of
Spiritualized, Supergrass, Portishead, Primal Scream and Ocean
Colour Scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought about everything, but I think the record turned out
pretty good in the end,'' Rebennack, 57, said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Some tracks such as ``John Gris'' and ``Voices in My Head''
re-create the swampy hoodoo feel of such classic Dr. John discs as
``Dr. John the Night Tripper,'' the 1968 album that established
Rebennack's ghostly alter-ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I liked about working with the London guys
was they weren't tryin' to do my thing, and I wasn't tryin' to do
their thing,'' Rebennack said. ``That's the only way this sort of
thing can work.''
</P>
<P>
   `TORN' NOTORIETY: Although she's fronted local rockers Ednaswap
for years, Anne Preven has found notoriety courtesy of an ex-soap
star from the Land Down Under.
</P>
<P>
   Preven's ``Torn,'' penned with songwriting partner and bandmate
Scott Cutler, was a worldwide smash for Aussie singer and TV
actress Natalie Imbruglia.
</P>
<P>
   ``That song had been covered a few times before,'' Preven said.
``The version before Natalie's was identical but didn't do well for
some reason. We have no control. Once a song has been recorded,
anyone that wants to can cover it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other tunes by Preven and Cutler have been recorded by Madonna
and Irish chanteuse Mary Black, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Ednaswap celebrates the release of its third album, ``Wonderland
Park'' (Island), with a free show at 10 tonight at Tower Sunset in
West Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Preven says ``Torn'' hasn't provided a financial windfall _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't received a dime, but we expect the royalties
sometime next year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, look out!
</P>
<P>
   SOUNDTRACK SCENE: The soundtrack to the film ``Permanent
Midnight'' boasts cuts from Crystal Method, Moby, Morcheeba, Girls
Against Boys, Prodigy, Spiritualized, Black Lab and a solo Art
Alexakis. The disc is due Sept. 15 from DGC/Critical Failure
Records.

KENNEDY CENTER NAMES 6 PERFORMANCE HONOREES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Shirley Temple, the little girl who saved a movie
studio from failure during the Depression, and Willie Nelson, who
helped reinvent country music, were among six people named Thursday
to receive the Kennedy Center's annual honors in the performning
arts.
</P>
<P>
   The others are the actor-comedian Bill Cosby, the Broadway
song-writing team of John Kander and Fred Ebb, and Andre Previn,
the composer, conductor and pianist, whose first opera, ``A
Streetcar Named Desire,'' will have its premiere at the San
Francisco Opera on Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   They will be honored at a gala at the Kennedy Center on Dec. 6,
which will be shown on CBS later that month.
</P>
<P>
   Because the award is for lifetime achievement, the recipients
are in their 60s and 70s. But although she is 70, Shirley Temple
Black is permanently engraved in the American memory as the little
moppet whose smiling optimism helped the nation through the weary
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   That memory is caused partly by her retirement from the movies
after appearing in ``A Kiss for Corliss'' when she was 21. She
appeared in 40 movies in the 1930s, before she was 12, including
``Little Miss Marker'' in 1934, the same year that she sang ``On
the Good Ship Lollipop'' in ``Bright Eyes.'' Daryl F. Zanuck said
that her movies saved his studio, 20th Century-Fox, from
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   She is remembered as well for sparkling tap dancing scenes with
Bill Bojangles Robinson, the great black dancer, at a time when the
movies did not allow close contacts between whites and blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know about that until I was 7 years old,'' Mrs. Black
said Thursday from her California home, discussing the country's
race relations problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I got a cold, the studio would send me to Palm
Springs, where I stayed at the Desert Inn,'' she said, with Bill
Robinson joining her to teach her dance steps for their next movie.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Which cottage are you in?' I asked him,'' she said, ``and he
answered, `You don't need to know, darling.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When she pressed him, she recalled, he answered: ``I am in the
chauffeur's cottage over the garage. But don't you worry about it.
I'm there with (italics)my(end italics) chauffeur.''
</P>
<P>
   Kander, the music writing half of Kander and Ebb, is 71 and has
been the professional partner of Ebb, 63, for half his life _ since
1962, a year otherwise notable for his Broadway debut as the
composer for ``A Family Affair,'' which flopped.
</P>
<P>
   Every New Yorker hums their ``New York, New York,'' and most
people everywhere are familiar with their other hits, like
``Cabaret,'' ``How Lucky Can You Get,'' ``Maybe This Time'' and
``All That Jazz.''
</P>
<P>
   Their shows include ``Cabaret'' and ``Chicago,'' both of which
are now enjoying successful revivals; ``Kiss of the Spider Woman''
and, for those with long memories, ``Flora, the Red Menace,'' in
which the teen-aged Liza Minelli made her Broadway debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like people to think of me as a good carpenter,'' Kander
said from his home in Manhattan Thursday. ``Being a good craftsman
means more to me than anything else. I take that very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to name other such craftsmen, he replied: ``Like
Stravinsky, like Gershwin, like Steve Sondheim, Jerome Kern, Jerry
Back.'' It is very unglamorous, to be wonderful at your craft.''
</P>
<P>
   Cosby, who is 61, has been an influential performer for many
reasons, not the least being his role as co-star, with Robert Culp,
in the 1060s television series ``I Spy,'' in which he became the
first black actor to play the lead role in a weekly series.
</P>
<P>
   He achieved even greater success in the highly rated ``Cosby
Show'' and is known as well for his stand-up comedy, his comedy
records and his best-selling books.
</P>
<P>
   Previn, 69, has ranged from jazz to classical music, with
Hollywood film scores in between. He was born in Berlin and fled
from the Nazis with his family to the United States in 1939. He was
working as an orchestrator for M-G-M while still in high school.

TIBETAN BUDDHISM, SCORSESE STYLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Not long into ``Kundun,'' a film about the early
life of the 14th Dalai Lama, you begin to wonder if Martin Scorsese
made the movie as a form of atonement. Or maybe the director of
such gut-wrenching, violent films such as ``Mean Streets'' (1973),
``Taxi Driver'' (1977), ``GoodFellas'' (1990) and ``Casino'' (1995)
chose to tell the story of the nonviolent spiritual leader of the
Tibetan people as a way of assuring that he wouldn't be
reincarnated as, say, a rock.
</P>
<P>
   Now that it's out on video, you have a chance to judge for
yourself. Told from the perspective of the current Dalai Lama
(Kundun is an honorary title meaning ``in the presence of the
Buddha''), the film begins in 1937 when he, as a mischievous
2-year-old, was recognized as Tibet's spiritual and political head,
a reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama. In an amusing scene, monks
test him by bringing a number of items owned by the previous Dalai
Lama _ a cane, a pair of glasses, etc., along with similar items,
and ask the child which ones were his. ``Mine,'' he cries as he
infallibly picks the ones belonging to the previous Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   The young boy is then taken to Tibet's capital, Lhasa, where he
leads a cloistered life as he is prepared for his eventual
enthronement.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, one understands he causes much of his own suffering
needlessly,'' the young Dalai Lama recites.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like he's giving advice to many of Scorsese's tortured
characters, but it also shows how the film functions in part as a
lesson in Buddhism. Like most lessons, however, it requires
patience to sit through. The script, written by Melissa Mathison
(``E.T.'') was based on remembrances of the exiled leader. Thus the
action is slow moving in the first half because of the restrained
and narrow perspective Scorsese takes as the film mirrors the
monk's early, restricted existence. World War II, the advent of the
atomic bomb and even the Chinese threat are as unreal and distant
to the boy as the old silent films he watches and short-wave radio
broadcasts he listens to.
</P>
<P>
   What we see mostly are the rituals surrounding the Dalai Lama,
including a scenes of a crazed shaman foretelling the future and a
bizarre funeral. While these early events are colorful, Scorsese,
who is known for his visual pyrotechnics, keeps the camera work
straightforward, as if it's a National Geographic documentary. You
almost expect a commentator to intone, ``The Tibetan people perform
this ceremony ...'' And at times you wish there was one, since
Scorsese doesn't explain scenes like the one where, as part of the
funeral for the Dalai Lama's father, the body is cut up and fed to
the birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kundun'' is blessed with an elegant and evocative
Oscar-nominated score by minimalist composer Philip Glass. Like
other of his film scores _ ``Koyaanisqatsi'' (1983) and ``Mishima''
(1985) _ Glass' music seems to blend seamlessly with the images.
</P>
<P>
   The film begins to expand _ along with Scorsese's camera work _
as the Dalai Lama begins to confront the outside world when the
Chinese invade in 1950. It's then we see a longtime Scorsese theme
emerge: the tortured soul whose faith is tested. Just look at
``Mean Streets,'' in which Harvey Keitel's Charlie is torn between
his Catholic faith, his mob connections and his girlfriend, or
Scorsese's other religious film, the controversial ``The Last
Temptation of Christ'' (1988), where Jesus (Willem Dafoe) must
sacrifice human love and gratifications to fulfill his destiny.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama faces his own crisis as he struggles to maintain
his religious order as the Chinese brutalize Tibet. In one stunning
scene reflecting the Dalai Lama's inner turmoil, Scorsese shows the
the red-robed monk amid bloody bodies of red-clad monks. The
overhead camera continues to pull back until the screen is filled
with hundreds of corpses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kundun'' ends with the Dalai Lama's escape in 1959 to India.
While ``Kundun'' is not Scorsese at his best, it's ultimately
compelling enough to make it worthwhile viewing.
</P>
<P>
   SIGNS OF LEO: Yes, that right. It's two Leonardo DiCaprios in
one film as ``The Man in the Iron Mask'' arrived in stores last
week as both a video and DVD release. A pleasant enough
swashbuckler, this retelling of the Dumas classic set during the
reign of Louis XIV in France has an all-star cast, including Oscar
winner Jeremy Irons (Aramis), John Malkovich (Athos), Gabriel Byrne
(d'Artagnan) and Gerard Depardieu (Porthos) as the Musketeers. It
is rather humorous that only Depardieu is French and that he speaks
his lines with an accent so thick you wish for subtitles. Leo is
cute enough as the king and his twin brother who were separated at
birth. It should be noted (this isn't giving anything away) that as
the man in the iron mask for six years, Leo is still blemish-free.
Nevertheless, ``Mask,'' written and directed by Randall Wallace
(the writer of ``Braveheart''), has enough swordplay and bedroom
antics to make it a diverting romp. It is, after all, August _ a
time for Leos.

`THE RAT PACK': EXTREMES WITH IMPOSSIBLE SCHEMES 
</HEADLINE>

   As he is about to walk onstage, an aging Frank Sinatra stops to
light a cigarette, or more precisely to have one lighted for him.
``Match me,'' he tells a male lackey, only to have an off-camera
woman with a sugary voice give him a light instead. ``Thanks,
doll,'' he tells her, walking on.
</P>
<P>
   You can hoot at this style as irredeemably tacky, or view it as
the essence of retro cool. You can even see it as both. Those
possibilities suggest the breadth of appeal behind the HBO film
``The Rat Pack,'' which recreates a dizzyingly energetic,
near-mythic phase of American culture.
</P>
<P>
   As anthropology or as sheer fun, a project called ``The Rat
Pack'' offers immense promise. Even a misguided ``Rat Pack,'' like
this one, holds some fascination.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the film is Sinatra's flashback to the late 1950s and
early '60s, when he seemed to rule show biz. In Las Vegas, he
cavorts onstage and through casinos, surrounded by the genuine
talents of Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. and the lesser lights of
Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop (the only surviving Rat Pack member).
He plays host to them at his Palm Springs estate where he serves
pasta for breakfast and keeps everyone supplied with booze and
broads. They were bad boys who offered vicarious hope to every
suburban couple: the men who envied their freedom and the women who
dreamed of their sex appeal.
</P>
<P>
   America turned away from the Rat Pack's martini-and-cigarette
chic in the mid-'60s, but the style has made a tongue-in-cheek
return in the '90s. The film ``Swingers'' and the forthcoming CBS
show ``Buddy Faro,'' about a onetime crony of the Rat Packers, are
two conspicuous examples of the era's recycled allure.
</P>
<P>
   That enticing aura is the crucial element missing from HBO's
disappointing film. Despite some high moments, it desperately lacks
the charismatic charge that would have explained it all. Viewers
can fill in the gaps in this pedestrian movie, but they really
shouldn't have to.
</P>
<P>
   The dark side of the Rat Pack myth was uncovered long ago, and
the film focuses on those elements: the callous treatment of women
and even of one another; Sinatra's friendships with both the mob
boss Sam Giancana and John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Liotta's problematic performance as Sinatra leaves a void in
the center of the film. The Rat Pack was built on his magnificent
voice and popularity; without that charisma, the group itself seems
a collection of louses and Sinatra merely a bully. Liotta can be
magnetic (as he was in films like ``Goodfellas''), but his appeal
is a cool, insinuating one. Nowhere is this more obvious than in
the difference between Liotta's icy blue eyes and those warmer ones
that caused Sinatra to be nicknamed ``Ol' Blue Eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The script offers Liotta no help. His Sinatra is already the Rat
Pack's Chairman of the Board, though there is no hint why anyone
would listen to him. Well, there is the fact that his pal Momo, as
Giancana is always called here, is usually hovering around; but
we're meant to believe that Sinatra's power comes from more than
that.
</P>
<P>
   The film telegraphs scenes rather than developing them. Marilyn
Monroe wafts through. So does Ava Gardner, divorced from Sinatra,
who still pines for her. In one scene, a pretty brunette walks into
a club and introduces herself: ``Judy Campbell, I'm here to see
Frank.'' Sinatra quickly passes the woman (now better known as
Judith Campbell Exner) along to both Giancana and Kennedy. ``Well,
chickie baby, its just you, me and the Girl Scouts,'' Sinatra tells
Kennedy when offering a choice between Campbell and another woman.
Though this straight-faced film has few campy impulses, it is hard
to beat the high camp of that line.
</P>
<P>
   As Peter Lawford, the actor and Kennedy brother-in-law, Angus
Macfadyen offers little more than a hard-to-place British accent.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Mantegna is convincing but seriously underused as Dean
Martin, who drinks apple juice onstage and stays sober while acting
thoroughly drunk. His self-protective detachment is intriguingly
hinted at.
</P>
<P>
   Don Cheadle has the most dynamic role as Davis. In a performance
that is not mimicry but a reimagining of a character in lifelike
terms, Cheadle captures the big grin and exaggerated laugh,
especially loud when Davis is the butt of the joke.
</P>
<P>
   In an explosive fantasy scene, Davis imagines singing and
dancing for a mob of Nazis in front of a neon sign with a racial
slur. This scene of self-debasement, anger and defiance powerfully
encapsulates the film's interpretation of Davis as a man who
endures racist jokes to break barriers and carve a path for future
black entertainers. (He even says that, far too literally.) This
startling, first-rate scene seems out of place; it is the only
reminder that the script was written by Kario Salem, who also wrote
the far more trenchant HBO film ``Don King: Only in America.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the film's exuberant moments is a re-creation of the Rat
Pack at a fund-raiser for Kennedy's presidential campaign, singing
the special lyrics Sammy Cahn had written for the Sinatra hit
``High Hopes.'' (``Everyone wants to back Jack/Jack is on the right
track.'')
</P>
<P>
   More typical is a scene that maps out everything. The camera
travels into several rooms and beds in the Sands Hotel: there is
JFK with Campbell; Sinatra with two women at once; Martin, the
family man, alone watching television.
</P>
<P>
   The film is nearly saved by William Petersen as Kennedy, who
displays all the charisma this Sinatra lacks. Kennedy lives
comfortably in his skin, exuding the sense that power, grace and
invincibility are his birthright. Sinatra, who scrapped his way up,
is desperate for this friendship and camaraderie.
</P>
<P>
   He comes through when Joseph P. Kennedy asks him to use his mob
connections to help JFK win the West Virginia primary. But Sinatra
never understands that the pimping and the gangster connections
that make him valuable in some ways also mean the Kennedys will
never truly embrace him.
</P>
<P>
   Martin sees that Robert F. Kennedy's determination to take on
the Mafia will make a blood brothership between JFK and Sinatra
impossible. Martin sardonically says: ``Brother Bobby made attorney
general. Nice to hear that a choirboy with a passion for sin will
be watchin' out for us.'' His statement heralds the end of Rat Pack
power.
</P>
<P>
   One major problem is the film's minimal use of music. The actors
lip-sync to snatches of songs performed by uninspired imitators.
The music is telling. Like its soundtrack, ``The Rat Pack'' offers
a tinny echo of the era and its stars.

`RAT PACK' LEAVES NO RUMOR UNEXPLORED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last month, when Ray Liotta turned up to promote ``The Rat
Pack,'' he was clearly irritated by the constant assertions that he
didn't look a thing like Frank Sinatra, even in a dimly lit room.
</P>
<P>
   No matter, it turns out. ``The Rat Pack,'' the story of the
glorious and glamorous alliance of Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy
Davis Jr., isn't about imitation as much as imagination.
</P>
<P>
   There's so much stuffed into this HBO film, airing at 8 p.m.
Sunday, that you have to wonder whether there is any
unsubstantiated rumor or tale the creators didn't cram in. The one
where a mobster says he can't whack Sinatra because it means never
again hearing him croon ``Chicago'' is a favorite, as is a scene in
which presidential candidate John F. Kennedy has a hotel
assignation with a mysteriously creepy brunette bombshell.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Kennedys, not the angry Sinatra family, ought to be
the ones crying foul about this film treatment, because John
Kennedy is portrayed as a lusty loverboy. (Having watched ``The Rat
Pack'' shortly before seeing President Clinton's live address about
his own lustful union was enough to bring on a patriotic
depression.)
</P>
<P>
   With this in mind, ``The Rat Pack'' is quite a fun ride, partly
because screenwriter Kario Salem (''Don King: Only in America'')
and director Rob Cohen have made a spirited film, focusing on a
very specific time, the late '50s and early '60s, when the Pack was
at the height of its power and panache.
</P>
<P>
   This was a time when the three, along with Joey Bishop (Bobby
Slayton) and Peter Lawford (Angus Macfadyen) appeared somewhat
bored with their stage accomplishments and sought higher ground, or
at least different footing.
</P>
<P>
   Martin (Joe Mantegna) readily embraces the hard-drinking,
hard-partying lifestyle while maintaining equilibrium with the wife
and family he rarely sees. The Dino here never seems all that happy
in either place.
</P>
<P>
   Davis (Don Cheadle) must stay in his place, a spot reserved for
a talented man wanting the perks of his white colleagues at a time
when it simply wasn't possible in a racially divided America.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra, meanwhile, wanted power, and that extended to the
nation's highest office. His relationship with President Kennedy in
this movie borders on worship; did Sinatra really go mad, busting
up an under-construction wing of his house after learning that
Kennedy wouldn't stay there during a California visit?
</P>
<P>
   Bishop is barely noticeable, and Lawford, then married to Pat
Kennedy, is written as a whining messenger boy scuttling between
the president and Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   Screaming ``Damn Kennedys!'' is the extent of his contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra's life fuels ``The Rat Pack,'' but the more prickly,
engaging scenes occur with Martin and Davis, two people who seem to
be tortured souls hiding behind public personas.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Martin takes the stage with not booze but apple
juice. And during one fine scene in which the camera pans past
different windows of the Sands Hotel, we see Davis, Kennedy and
Sinatra going at it with women, while Martin sits stoically downing
a glass of milk, watching television.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Mantegna tries hard but never connects with
Martin's slow, suave baritone when he speaks. The portrayal of Dino
as a man more often alone than cruising was an intriguing sight.
</P>
<P>
   While watching white supremacists rally outside his hotel
window, upset over his engagement to a white Swedish actress, Davis
dreams up a sequence in which he walks out in front of the mob and
bursts into ``I've Got You Under My Skin.'' It's a fabulous
segment, with Cheadle tapping up a storm _ apparently the crash
course with Tony-winning tapdancer Savion Glover paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three, I have the most questions about Davis; how, for
instance, he was able to hang with the Rat Pack with race staring
him in the face. During one poignant performance scene, he's shown
laughing at a racist joke from Sinatra, turning away from the
audience, then grimacing.
</P>
<P>
   He later explains to his fiancee, ``So I get a little dirt on my
uniform sometimes. But I'm circling the bases, baby. And the fellas
who come up behind me are gonna have it easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Martin and Davis stand out because Sinatra, pop-culture
figure, has been done to death, including that weak-kneed CBS
miniseries orchestrated by his daughter, Tina, in 1992. By the end
of ``The Rat Pack,'' I could only say, ``Wow, I never knew Frank
had a thing for toy trains.''

THE PASSIONS THAT SEETHE UNDER THE ORDERLY SURFACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the dead of night, a husband, inflamed by suspicion, returns
home early from a fishing outing. In the bedroom, his beautiful
wife, who sent him off with a neatly wrapped snack and wished him
good luck, moans naked and ecstatic against the body of another
man.
</P>
<P>
   The husband enters the house, seizes a gleaming knife, makes his
way to the bedroom, stabs her lover and plunges the long blade
repeatedly into his wife as she stares into his face. When life has
drained from her, he gently covers her body, mounts his bicycle and
pedals blood-drenched to the police station to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   So begins ``The Eel,'' the riveting, wrenching film by Shohei
Imamura that won the Palme d'Or at the 1997 Cannes International
Film Festival. Adapted by the director from ``Sparkles in the
Darkness,'' a novel by Akira Yoshima, ``The Eel'' swims with grace,
insight and vast compassion along the ineradicable fault line that
separates flawed mankind from the elusive realization of heavenly
perfection.
</P>
<P>
   In telling his story, Imamura, the Japanese filmmaker who also
won the Palme d'Or in 1983 for ``The Ballad of Narayama,'' marshals
a small cast of vivid characters that enable him not only to bare
the passions that seethe beneath the orderly surface and apparent
conformity of Japanese life but also to ponder emotions and issues
that know no nationality.
</P>
<P>
   Among these may be counted jealousy, rage, crime, punishment,
remorse, the onerous baggage of ghosts and guilt and, most of all,
the possibilities of redemption, the persistence of hope, the
achievement of love and the miracles of rebirth and survival.
</P>
<P>
   The murderous husband, Takuro Yamashita (played by Koji Yakusho
of ``Shall We Dance?''), is Imamura's Everyman. At the outset of
``The Eel,'' Yamashita is one of those people the Japanese call a
salaryman _ a blue-suited, white-shirted, stripe-tied corporate
drone commuting between home and skyscraper office.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, swinging his arms and lifting his knees in
the automaton's march of an obedient prisoner, he is ushered into
the office of the warden, warned not to be drawn into trouble of
any kind and paroled into the custody of a Buddhist priest.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the warden's caution, Yamashita takes with him his pet
eel. ``He listens to what I say,'' Yamashita explains to those who
ask. And the eel doesn't say what he doesn't want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Along a bleak stretch of coast, Yamashita begins his new life. A
prison-trained hair cutter, he sets about restoring a ramshackle
barbershop. Grim, repressed, uncommunicative, he keeps mostly to
himself, except for an occasional nocturnal eel-fishing expedition
with one of the townsmen, an authority on their life cycle.
</P>
<P>
   But one day, through the window of his shop, Yamashita spies a
woman who bears an uncanny resemblance to his wife. Not long
afterward, while on a solitary outing to net food for his pet from
an inlet, he finds the woman unconscious in the grass. His impulse
is to flee, but soon he returns. The life of the woman, who had
attempted suicide, is saved.
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Keiko Hattori (Misa Shimizu of ``Okoge''), who
explains, ``I fell in love with the wrong man.'' The wrong man will
eventually reappear.
</P>
<P>
   Keiko, too, is in the care of the priest and his wife, and
because Keiko does not want to return to Tokyo but is eager to
work, Yamashita is asked to accept her as a helper.
</P>
<P>
   Yamashita is not pleased, but soon business is booming. Despite
his blunt indifference, Keiko improves the premises; she prepares
and serves tidbits for waiting customers like Masaki Saito (Ken
Kobayashi), the young man who plans to borrow the barber pole for a
site he is preparing in hope of attracting a UFO and befriending
aliens from outer space.
</P>
<P>
   What he and Yamashita share is a fear of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had my fill of women,'' Yamashita tells Keiko.
</P>
<P>
   As time passes, though, she warms to him. But Imamura, though
not without a sense of humor, scarcely intends to deliver a
conventional resolution in which Yamashita comes to terms with his
past and returns from the living dead.
</P>
<P>
   Both Yamashita and Keiko are plagued by nightmares, figurative
and literal, from their past: Yamashita by a former fellow
prisoner, a drunken, rapacious lout working as a garbage man who
taunts him for his lack of overt remorse and reveals his history to
Keiko; and Keiko by her insane mother, Fumie, and Dojima, her
vengeful former lover and business associate who has a claim on
Fumie's fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Given the bloody opening, the film is suffused with tension.
Having once revealed his capacity for murderous rage, Yamashita
remains throughout a potentially volcanic figure, and harking back
to the beginning of ``The Eel,'' Imamura imbues the stropping of a
razor with high tension.
</P>
<P>
   The barber's rejection of the lunches Keiko dangles from a
bridge on his early morning returns from fishing resonate with the
mournful, crippling stubbornness of those whose experience of
betrayal and pain makes them erect a shield against love.
</P>
<P>
   Yakusho and Ms. Shimizu deliver unerring performances in a
splendid film that harvests hope from a bleak landscape. &QL;

 By VICKI GOLDBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the beginning, photography was referred to as the
handmaid of art. It might have been called the valet of history as
well, for it promised to serve its times, make them presentable and
arrange for them to appear unwilted onstage before large audiences
in very long plays. These services have been something of a mixed
blessing. The handmaid eventually tried to usurp her mistress'
place, and the valet often sent history into the world naked.
</P>
<P>
   In almost every country, photographers picked up cameras and
recorded people and events as a matter of course. Many of these
dutiful guardians of history remained unknown outside their
nation's borders, some almost unknown within them. Often enough the
local talent, like Martin Chambi in Peru or Seydou Keita in Mali,
photographers in countries that had been isolated or colonized or
only made highly visible in the industrialized West by visiting
photographers, have only recently been discovered by foreigners.
Much has been written in our day suggesting that such photographers
might see things differently from occupying powers or relative
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is the work of Sunil Janah, an 80-year-old
Indian photographer whose work during World War II, the struggle
for independence and the postwar years in India is little known in
the United States but highly regarded in his native land, where a
limited number of images have been shown repeatedly. Now more than
300 of his photographs, many never exhibited or published anywhere
before, are on view in ``Sunil Janah: Photographing India
1942-1978'' at the Gallery at 678 in the East Village.
</P>
<P>
   A few of Janah's pictures have been traveling in the United
States for the last two years in a show and book called ``India: A
Celebration of Independence 1947-1997,'' and a larger exhibition
was at Fotofest in Houston in 1990, but other than 20 or so
photographs at the Overseas Press Club in 1985, this is the first
time his work has been shown in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ram Rahman, curator of the current show, has grouped this huge
outpouring of unframed pictures, which include exhibition prints,
work prints and contact sheets, on large panels. The contact sheets
reveal that the photographer radically cropped his pictures,
excising heads from waist-length portraits to create tight
close-ups. Explanatory captions provide indispensable background
for some of the historical material.
</P>
<P>
   Janah was a political reporter during World War II and for a
short while after, taking many candid photographs of Gandhi, Nehru
and other politicians and dramatic shots of demonstrations.
Pictorial records can uncover the naked ironies of history. In a
picture made in Calcutta in 1946, when rationing was still in
force, people standing in line for food can be identified by their
dress as a mixed group of Hindus, Muslims and Christians. Two days
later, murderous riots broke out between Hindus and Muslims; Janah
photographed bloated bodies lying in the street. Later still, he
photographed the aftermath: a barbed-wire fence separating the
Hindu and Muslim quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Disgusted with politics, Janah soon gave up such reporting. For
years he took studio portraits, strongly lighted, of India's
leading political and artistic figures. He photographed famous
dancers in sequences of stills and Hindu temple sculptures that
celebrate some of the qualities visible in the dance. Contact
sheets of a dancer's exaggerated facial expressions, odd to Western
eyes, document the importance of mime in Indian dance. On
commission, Janah also took highly designed industrial pictures
that look like images of the 1930s, in part because they speak of a
similar level of hope in industrialization.
</P>
<P>
   He photographed Indian tribal people extensively, evidently
enjoying their openness and sensual ease. A few women posed like
pin-ups; Janah says they fell into such poses without his
direction, though they had never seen a camera. Over and over, they
smiled: at him, at one another, at some remark, exuding more
natural gaiety than coaxing ever calls forth at urban birthday
parties. He recalls that working with these people was a great
relief after hidebound middle-class Indian life. His pictures,
which must have been meaningful to anthropologists, have turned
into an irreplaceable record of people whose lives were later
radically changed by development.
</P>
<P>
   Americans saw India's complex and terror-filled progress to
independence chiefly through Margaret Bourke-White's magisterial
photographs in Life magazine and her book ``Halfway to Freedom,''
or through Henri Cartier-Bresson's on-the-spot reportage. A
comparison of Janah's insider reports and Bourke-White's work is
particularly revealing because he accompanied her and translated
for her in some of her travels around the country shortly before
independence.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter, he had become a Communist (like many in the
intellectual classes at the time) as well as a professional
photographer in 1942, to take pictures of the Bengal famine for
People's War, the Communist magazine. Janah said the famine, which
killed 2 million people in Bengal alone and then spread south, was
caused by the diversion of plentiful supplies of grain to British
troops, by middlemen who then set prohibitive prices, and by
British destruction of the barges that might have carried what was
available to stricken districts. None of this was reported in the
mainstream press, which was censored by British authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Janah photographed lines of emaciated people waiting for food,
groups of skeletons, hungry dogs gnawing at human bones. People's
War gave this secret famine enormous amounts of space. Postcards of
Janah's images were printed and sent across the world to raise
funds. These pictures were not censored because the Communists were
the only Indian party supporting the British. The magazine had
publicly called on Indians to recognize that fascism was the real
enemy and that sabotage of British war efforts hurt everyone's
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Bourke-White sought out Janah because of his reputation, skills
and access. He was happy enough to let Life pay the expenses of the
Communist Party's photographer. One group of photographs at the
gallery shows Bourke-White herself with tripod and large-format
camera. More provocative are a few images of the same subjects
taken by both. The American knew how to make monumental and
memorable images, full of dignity, sorrow and a formal air of
permanence: temporary images elevated to mythic stature. The Indian
was frequently more informal and candid, not necessarily better or
worse but wholly different in approach.
</P>
<P>
   He says today that he did not have the disadvantage of being a
woman or a foreigner. Another and even more pragmatic reason
explains why he often photographed from an angle while she usually
stood directly in front of her subjects. She had a flash
arrangement keyed to her shutter, which set off several lights when
she took the picture. Janah was using a hand-held Rolleiflex that
had no flash. He asked her to let him know when she was going to
photograph, then he took his picture at a rapid shutter speed by
the light that she provided.
</P>
<P>
   Thus was history recorded simultaneously by photographers whose
different equipment, nationalities, approaches and probably
temperaments made it a variable commodity. Sometimes these two
photographers worked on parallel rather than identical tracks,
sometimes they went their own ways, but the distinctions often
showed up nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   They were photographing from different personal positions and
for different audiences as well. Bourke-White's bold, static,
iconic images were an effective form of shorthand to sum up major
events in a photo essay for a public that knew little of the place
or people. Janah's style, similar in many ways to hers, tended to
be looser, somewhat more caught on the wing and intimate. No doubt
this worked well for people who were living the events themselves
and could readily identify the signs of caste and religion that
photographs automatically picked up.
</P>
<P>
   Two faithful servants of history with slightly varying notions
of the job description prove once again that keeping accounts is
not as straightforward as it looks.
</P>

SILENT KILLER: HEPATITIS C SLOWLY DESTROYS LIVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Is the Age of Aquarius is coming back to haunt its
flower children?
</P>
<P>
   Young people who reveled in the hedonism of the 1960s and '70s
are discovering that the legacy of those years is a devastating and
sometimes fatal disease now reaching epidemic proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Little did they know that intravenous drug use, tattoos and body
piercing would be an invitation to a slow-growing virus that
eventually would become the recently identified hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   Like other forms of hepatitis, the C variety inflames the liver,
causing debilitating symptoms or, even more frightening, virtually
no symptoms until the disease is on the eve of destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of contracting hepatitis C continues today. Foolhardy
people still pierce, tattoo and inject themselves with unsterile
needles. Unsafe promiscuous sex can put partners in danger.
Health-care workers who suffer accidental needle sticks must be on
guard.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, these people, too, could begin to feel the
effects of the insidious illness.
</P>
<P>
   But it's patients who received blood transfusions before 1992,
before testing of the blood supply was refined, who are the target
of an intense public-education campaign spearheaded by the office
of the U.S. surgeon general, Dr. David Satcher.
</P>
<P>
   Satcher's office has urged organizations such as the American
Red Cross, hospitals and blood banks to notify pre-1992 blood
recipients and recommend they be tested for hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying and contacting that population will be a daunting
but worthwhile task, doctors say. Though critics have questioned
the cost-effectiveness of alerting people to a disease that can be
treated in less than half of all cases, health-care advocates
insist patients have a right to know their health status and that
withholding information is disgraceful.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is preposterous,'' says Dr. Michael Altman, a Phoenix
gastroenterologist, president of the Arizona chapter of the
American Liver Foundation. Although conceding that better
treatments are needed, he says he can offer patients hope. ``Why
would you not want to know?''
</P>
<P>
   Only about 5 percent of patients refuse medication, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who cannot be cured must be informed on how to manage
their disease and how to avoid transmitting it. They should drink
no alcohol, be scrupulous about protecting others from infection
and maintain good nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   How long hepatitis C has been around is anybody's guess. It may
have its origins in World War II, where unsterile battlefield blood
transfusions could have spread the virus.
</P>
<P>
   First called non-A, non-B hepatitis because its specific virus
couldn't be differentiated from other strains, it wasn't identified
until 1975. A blood test wasn't developed until 1989.
</P>
<P>
   That blood test remained unreliable until 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike hepatitis A (transmitted through unsanitary food
preparation) and hepatitis B (spread through blood and sexual
contact), for which there are vaccines and effective cures, the C
strain becomes chronic in 85 percent of cases.
</P>
<P>
   It is the leading cause of cirrhosis, which scars the liver and
inhibits its function.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates put the number of infected Americans at 4 million.
Cases of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, number only 1 million.
Although deaths from the human immunodeficiency virus are
declining, fatal cases of hepatitis C are rising, expecting to
triple in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet HIV has enjoyed much more media and medical attention.
Doctors who work with hepatitis C patients are dismayed by such
inequities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the furor raised over HIV,'' says Altman, the Phoenix
gastroenterologist. ``(Hepatitis) C has been underpublicized.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, three-fourths of all victims of hepatitis C are
unaware they carry the disease. Many show no signs of infection.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when hepatitis C reaches its end stage, it becomes the
leading reason for liver transplants. More than 4,000 transplants
are performed each year, and 10,000 names are on the waiting list.
About 1,000 patients will die while waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Although diseased kidneys can be assisted by dialysis, no
machine can perform the functions of the liver.
</P>
<P>
   But at a hefty 4.5 pounds, the organ has a lot of reserve, says
Dr. David Leibowitz, gastroenterologist and chair of the department
of medicine at Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the liver's large capacity allows it to quietly
harbor disease for many years without signaling its deterioration.
When the silence finally is broken, the patient may experience
fatigue, malaise, flulike symptoms, weakness, jaundice.
</P>
<P>
   More serious symptoms indicating advanced disease include fluid
retention in the ankles and abdomen, confusion, increased risk of
bleeding, intestinal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Until a routine blood test picks up elevated liver enzymes,
problems may go undetected. Only a specific blood test will
identify hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   Early detection is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to catch hepatitis C early,'' says Dr. David
Douglas, a liver specialist at Mayo Clinic Scottsdale. ``We hope to
catch people before they develop cirrhosis. . . . It is a very
silent, progressive disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas is director of the Mayo liver clinic and medical
director of the liver transplant program, which is just getting
under way.
</P>
<P>
   Mayo is conducting several research protocols on hundreds of
hepatitis C patients. Age of the patients ranges from people in
their 20s to those in their 80s and 90s.
</P>
<P>
   Although doctors hesitate to call treatments for hepatitis C
``cures'' _ scattered bits of virus may remain, says Leibowitz of
the Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center _ medication does offer
some hope. Currently, the drug of choice is interferon, which
produces remission or suppression of the virus in about 20 percent
of cases. That means liver enzymes appear normal and the virus
cannot be detected.
</P>
<P>
   Interferon is delivered as self-administered injections three
times a week for 12 to 18 months. Some patients tolerate the drug
well. Some experience serious physical and emotional side effects,
including depression.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved use of
another drug, ribavirin, which in combination with interferon
boosts recovery rates to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's significant,'' says Douglas of Mayo Clinic Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Such combinations of drugs, called cocktails, are proving to be
sound methods of treatment for diseases such as hepatitis C and
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas predicts that more drugs, including anti-viral agents,
will be developed and used to battle hepatitis C in the next three
to five years.
</P>
<P>
   A research laboratory in California also is working on a
vaccine, says Good Samaritan's Leibowitz, that could be used one
day to immunize all newborns in the same way infants are currently
vaccinated against hepatitis B.
</P>
<P>
   So-called ``universal'' vaccines are ``the way to go,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Education is the key to managing hepatitis C now, Douglas says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trying to raise public awareness of hepatitis C,''
he says. ``People aren't aware of liver diseases in general.''
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma with the current epidemic, says Phoenix
gastroenterologist Altman, is ``how do we go about educating people
without alarming or frightening them?''
</P>
<P>
   The American Liver Foundation is committed to supporting
research and informing the public about liver diseases. The
foundation lobbies Congress for funding and works with the National
Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   In the Valley, the Arizona chapter of the Liver Foundation
sponsors monthly support groups for patients, hosts seminars for
patients and primary care physicians, and conducts programs in
schools that alert children to the dangers of drug and alcohol
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Altman, who also participates in research studies, is optimistic
about the treatment of hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rapidly evolving therapeutic arena,'' he says. ``I tell
my patients to call me every six months. We're all frustrated by
having a 20 percent cure rate (with interferon alone), but it's the
best we've got right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay tuned.'' &QL;

   PROFILE-BISHOP-BOS (Boston) _ BARBARA HARRIS: THE ECLECTIC
ECCLESIASTIC &QL; 
Bishop Barbara Clementine Harris knelt at the altar, her
68-year-old knees padded only by her cassock's thin beige cloth.
Head lowered, she gently lifted a wet cloth from a plastic tub and
washed a man's bare feet. The foot washing is a yearly Episcopal
ritual, symbolic of Jesus' washing the Apostles' feet, a show of
humility. For those gathered, seeing Harris humbled was impressive.
After all, she is the suffragan (assisting) bishop for
Massachusetts, which means she is second in command of the nation's
largest Episcopal diocese. By Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez. Photo.

   MORMON-MISSIONARIES-ART-BOS (Boston) _ Tenille Roberts and
Amanda Williams are privates in a formidable army. Their uniform is
a pressed white shirt, ankle-length skirt, and sensible walking
shoes. Their weapon is a Spanish version of The Book of Mormon.
``We're here because the Lord wants us here,'' said Williams,
riding a bus and cheerfully asking strangers if they had read the
Mormon gospel. ``We're here to offer people the truth.'' And the
number of people across the country, and around the world willing
to embrace that truth has been, in the view of many religious
scholars, nothing short of phenomenal. By Diego Ribadebeira.

<P>
   RELIGION-COLUMN-BOS (Undated) _ These are difficult days for
gays and lesbians and their supporters. They are coming under

Ribadeneira.

<P>
   KIDS-REASON-REVIEW-NYT _ At the age of 7, a child is considered
by the Roman Catholic Church to have reached the ``age of reason''
and is entitled to receive communion. Some evangelical churches
hold that a child of 7 can make an independent spiritual choice. In
Judaism and Islam, a boy of 7 is expected to begin his religious
studies and participate, to some degree, in adult rituals like
fasting and praying. But is a child of such tender years a
responsible being, capable of telling right from wrong and
accountable, not just legally but morally, for his actions? By
Susan Sachs.

PAYING THE PRICE FOR PAST'S PRECARIOUS LIFESTYLE?  
 (ART ADV: PHOTO HAS BEEN SENT TO NYTNS CLIENTS) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once an avid cyclist who rode 40 miles a day to her job running
a California bed-and-breakfast, Ward no longer could get out of
bed. Debilitating fatigue forced her to abandon the B&AMP;B.
</P>
<P>
   For three to four months, she would feel well. Then the fatigue
would return with a vengeance, knocking her flat for two weeks to
two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It devastated me financially,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She suffered chronic back problems, gastrointestinal disorders,
recurrent yeast infections, fever and night sweats, excruciating
muscle pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going crazy. I thought I was insane,'' says
Ward, 41, who now lives in Phoenix. ``You lay in bed and cry
because your entire body hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   She was treated for countless diseases but continued to
languish.
</P>
<P>
   For almost five months in 1994, she couldn't keep food down and
lived on liquid supplements sipped a few tablespoons every hour.
Her weight slipped from 135 to 102.
</P>
<P>
   When doctors treated her for reflux disease, she improved some
and subsisted on a liquid diet. She was still far from healthy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The next year, a holistic doctor told her she had liver
disease. But she tested negative for what ultimately would be her
diagnosis:
</P>
<P>
   hepatitis C, once known by the vague label ``non-A, non-B''
hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
   For perhaps 20 years, she would learn, the hepatitis C virus had
been preying on her body, causing chronic inflammation of her
liver, an organ whose job is to detoxify and discard products
produced in the body. It also manufactures proteins, clotting
factors and hormones.
</P>
<P>
   A gastroenterologist finally diagnosed Ward in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis C, which experts say is reaching epidemic proportions,
has become the leading reason for liver transplants. Such
celebrities as daredevil Evel Knievel and singer Naomi Judd _ a
former nurse _ have hepatitis C. Rock singer David Crosby underwent
a liver transplant in 1994 after fighting alcoholism and hepatitis
C.
</P>
<P>
   How could Ward have contracted such a nasty disease?
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis C most often is passed from person to person by way of
blood transfusions, intravenous drug use, unsterile needles used in
body piercing or tattooing, accidental needle sticks by health-care
workers, and, to a lesser extent, unsafe promiscuous sex.
</P>
<P>
   Ward says that in her younger days, she dabbled in marijuana and
cocaine. Snorting cocaine can rupture tiny blood vessels in the
nostrils and allow tainted blood to be passed when coke straws are
shared.
</P>
<P>
   She has a tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   Ward also has discovered that several former friends who were
patients of her dentist in California have come down with hepatitis
C. Did unsterile dental equipment convey the virus?
</P>
<P>
   She may never know the cause of her disease, but her concern now
is to keep it at bay and ward off the worst of liver ailments _
cirrhosis and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Cirrhosis produces scarring of the liver tissue and prevents it
from performing its detoxification duties.
</P>
<P>
   Ward has just finished a year of treatment on the only drug that
works on hepatitis C: interferon. She calls it her ``year in
hell.'' Used alone, interferon results in remission in about 20
percent of cases.
</P>
<P>
   Participating in an experimental program at Mayo Clinic
Scottsdale, she has been giving herself injections of interferon
three times a week. She also has been taking a pill that may be a
drug called ribavirin, which can boost the effectiveness of
interferon and double its cure rate.
</P>
<P>
   Because she is in a double blind study, she may have been taking
a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   For some people, interferon treat ment can be nearly as
devastating as the disease it's meant to cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like you have the flu all the time,'' says Ward, who
has battled lethargy, clogged saliva glands, chronic yeast
infections, urinary-tract infections and depression _ all because
of the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   She believes that her illness is in remission. If the interferon
ultimately proves ineffective, however, she would begin a second
course.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment is a financial burden. Ward lives with her elderly
mother, who is blind and has cancer, and depends on public
assistance. She is hoping to find a job and obtain Social Security
disability payments.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster her emotional state, she attends a support group for
hepatitis C patients but says that can be troubling. Although she
receives solace from group members, dealing, in turn, with their
woes is saddening.
</P>
<P>
   She would like personal counseling but can't afford it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would give up anything to be able to speak one-on-one with a
counselor once a week,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Though her condition has improved, Ward fears a relapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I'm in remission I feel I'm going to get better,'' she
says. ``But what happens six months from now?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; At one time, Ward felt guilty about her disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was a horrible person because I contracted
hepatitis C,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Family members have been emotionally and financially supportive,
but some relatives refuse to visit her, believing they will become
infected. That is hurtful, Ward says, and adds to the stigma.
</P>
<P>
   Now, noting how many other people have hepatitis C _ an
estimated 4 million representing all walks of life _ she no longer
feels shame, which has given her the courage to counsel others.
</P>
<P>
   She even advocates for patients seeking transplants, though she
has decided that she would not undergo transplant surgery herself
if her condition deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a personal choice,'' she says. ``This is the way I came
into the world, and this is the way I'll leave this world. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this disease. I didn't want it, but I have it, and I
have to live with it.'' &QL;

ANTIQUES COLUMN: SEEING BEAUTY IN THE BUG ON THE WALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., N.J., Del., Conn.)   (af)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Salvador Dali used to take live beetles to lunch with him at the
St. Regis. He kept them in a clear plastic box on the table and
watched, riveted, as they navigated mounds of sand. He found them
more interesting than his companions. Vladimir Nabokov loved
butterflies and was expert at catching them; he gave them names
like Karner Blue and Satyr I and II. He may have taken his cue from
the surrealist Andre Breton, who mounted boxes of butterflies on
the walls of his Paris apartment in the 1920s. Victorians, like the
British aristocrat in the film ``Angels and Insects,'' invited
young men who had scoured the globe for natural specimens to their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   The fascination for nature in a box persists. One exhibition
this summer is a new take on an old subject. With ``Etre Nature,''
at the Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art in Paris through
Sept. 20, the curator, Herve Chandes, said he wanted to explore
``the role of the artist when faced with Creation with a capital
C.'' He asked 20 international artists to investigate ``the
reciprocity between a work of art and nature.'' One of them,
Jacques Kerchache, does not make art: he collects odd bug
specimens. ``I look at an insect as the work of a fully fledged
artist,'' he said. His exquisitely mounted boxes of large black
beetles look like shining jewels.
</P>
<P>
   Kerchache quoted the French structuralist Claude Levi-Strauss:
``A bird, a beetle, a butterfly call for the same rapt
contemplation that we reserve for a Tintoretto or a Rembrandt.''
The point, Chandes said, is that ``these beetles are not in a
nature museum; they are in an art show.''
</P>
<P>
   Other artists displayed bronzes of snakes and turtles in cases
with the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 16th century, Europeans were assembling natural
history specimens in ``wonder rooms.'' As Victoria Newhouse writes
in her new book, ``Towards a New Museum'' (Monacelli Press), ``The
cabinet of curiosities, or Wunderkammer, was a room whose walls and
ceilings, cupboards and drawers, housed collections that included a
bizarre spectrum of natural curiosities as well as art objects.''
The natural objects could include anything from bits of coral to
crystals to flies, and they were mounted right next to the
antiquities and paintings.
</P>
<P>
   In her effort to distinguish these domestic spaces from what
later would become museums for fine art, Ms. Newhouse notes: ``In
contrast with the devotional and didactic purposes of religious
collections, these cabinets were intended primarily to `entertain
and amuse' and only secondarily to instruct or uplift.'' The
Hapsburg Emperor Rudolf II (1552-1612) was deeply interested in
science, and he imported artists, botanists, astronomers and
philosophers to his court in Prague. When one artist, Joris
Hoefnagel, created a lavishly illustrated manuscript of natural
life, he was not afraid to mix his art with examples from real
life. He glued dragonfly wings onto the bodies of the insects he
painted.
</P>
<P>
   In the 17th century, the Dutch and Flemish showed ``trophies''
from nature, found in the age of exploration, in their own ``wonder
rooms.'' These were recorded in paintings by artists like Jan
Bruegel the Elder and Adriaen van Stalbemt, including those on
display now through Nov. 1, at the National Gallery of Art in
Washington in ``A Collector's Cabinet.'' These collectors, said
Earl A. Powell 3d, the director of the National Gallery, were
``armed with the belief that God had placed man at the center of
the world and had provided him with the means to achieve unlimited
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   As Powell writes in the catalog: ``Their collections contained
both unusual natural phenomena, or naturalia, such as shells or
coral, and remarkable human creations, or artificialia, such as
paintings, sculpture or graphic arts.''
</P>
<P>
   The French followed suit. Who can forget Louis XV's rhinoceros,
said to be the first ever that was stuffed and mounted, which
arrived in France in 1770? The Encyclopedists cataloged natural
specimens, and their efforts are still on display at the National
Museum of Natural History in Paris. Its Gallery of Entomology, for
example, has some 1,500 specimens, including the rarest
butterflies, stored in elegant wooden drawers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A person does not have to be an entomologist, however, to be
attracted to the gorgeous display of bugs. Even the squeamish have
no trouble displaying somebody else's collection, especially when
the antique case is curly maple and the copper plate lettering in
Latin is a beautiful script.
</P>
<P>
   The dealer Michael Trapp, of West Cornwall, Conn., is selling
several glass cases from the late 19th and early 20th centuries
that display artfully mounted butterflies, African crickets,
rhinoceros beetles and praying mantises. ``Controlled nature is
like controlled fantasy,'' Trapp said. ``It makes you think about
the mind behind it _ the collector who had the time to go around
the world, who had the money, the leisure and interest. I think the
appeal may be not so much the love of nature as love of
possession.'' His cases range from $225 to $400.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Marotta, a Manhattan antiques dealer, recently sold 15 cases
of butterflies and moths from the 1870s. ``Anything dealing with
the garden appeals to people today,'' he said. ``It's nature
without killing anything. People want to bring the outside in, year
round. It's also very decorative. Interior designers use these
collections as sculptures.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Taylor, the proprietor of Praiseworthy Antiques, a
by-appointment Manhattan gallery, just sold a set of 20 Riker Mount
boxes displaying butterflies collected in the 1950s and 1960s by a
man who had been in the military. Each insect was numbered; in a
corresponding book was its name and where it was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were bought by a woman who had boys aged 7, 4 and 3,''
Taylor recalled. ``She said, `This is what I want my kids to look
at as they grow up.' She bought them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said a good bug box costs $50 to $500. ``Bugs are so
flamboyant; they appeal to everyone,'' he said. ``They also skip
the language barrier.''
</P>
<P>
   John Malchione, a dealer in sporting collectibles in
Centerville, Del., is selling old fishing lures in Booth No. 1107
at the Irene Stella's Antiques Weekend in Somerset, N.J., tomorrow
and Sunday. One of his old glass cases boasts 80 hand-tied trout
and salmon flies, each housed in its own red velvet square, and
costs $450. ``The beautiful colors of the flies and the hand-forged
hooks make for a wonderful display,'' Malchione said. ``The people
who tied flies before the second world war were true masters of the
art.'' His cases cost $150 to $1,200, and he said his best
customers were women.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, bugs are fashionable. ``There's this real fascination
with the natural sciences now,'' Taylor said. ``They were always
interesting to collectors, but now it's the masses.''
</P>
<P>
   He might be right. The new advertisement for Absolut Citron
features exquisite yellow butterflies hovering on top of the vodka
bottle. The teen-agers who avidly collect Absolut print
advertisements today are obviously too young to drink, but this one
is directed toward collectors of all ages.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Like hepatitis A and B, hepatitis C is a chronic inflammation of
the liver caused by a virus. In advanced stages, it can cause
cirrhosis, or scarring, of the liver. It also can lead to liver
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   2. Who is at risk for hepatitis C?
</P>
<P>
   People who have been intravenous drug users, undergone body
piercing, had tattoos, engaged in unsafe promiscuous sex, had a
blood transfusion before 1992 or work in the health care field and
are subject to accidental needle sticks may have contracted the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   3. How long does hepatitis C take to develop?
</P>
<P>
   Signs of the disease may not show up for as long as 20 years
after infection.
</P>
<P>
   4. Who should be tested for hepatitis C?
</P>
<P>
   Those identified as being in high risk groups should have a
blood test to determine liver enzyme levels. If levels are high,
they should be tested specifically for hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   5. What are the symptoms of hepatitis C?
</P>
<P>
   There may be few or no symptoms. Or the patient could suffer
fatigue, muscle pain, jaundice, flulike symptoms, weakness. More
serious signs include fluid retention in the ankles and abdomen,
confusion, increased risk of bleeding, intestinal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   6. Where can I find more information about hepatitis C and other
liver diseases?
</P>
<P>
   The American Liver Foundation at 800-GO-LIVER (800-465-4837); or
www.liverfoundation.org on the World Wide Web.

CALIFORNIA CANDIDATES ZERO IN ON FERTILE CENTRAL VALLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE and ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. _ California's Central Valley is a region of
fertile farms and unpredictable politics. And in this year's
gubernatorial race, it has become an unusual battleground for the
Democratic and Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the region, a major supplier of fruits and
vegetables, have often complained that politicians neglect it in
favor of the vote-rich urban and suburban areas. Their party
allegiances are more malleable than in San Francisco and Los
Angeles County, which are largely Democratic strongholds, or in
Orange County, San Diego and far northern California, which favor
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Valley is the place where the next governor is going to
be elected,'' Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, the Democratic candidate for
governor, told a crowd of 200 supporters at a park next to the
Stockton City Hall. ``I am going to spend so much time here you're
going to get tired of seeing me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the middle and they're fighting for the middle,''
said Allen Sawyer, a deputy district attorney for San Joaquin
County. ``I think we could be convinced by either party if they
show concern for our issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis made his pitch Wednesday, taking a bus tour through
Fresno, Modesto and Stockton. The tour followed a debate in Fresno
with his Republican opponent, Attorney General Dan Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren staged his own Central Valley bus tour last week,
touting his endorsement by the California Farm Bureau Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates claim they would do more for the area as
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to do my level best to make sure the Valley is a
full partner in decisions we make in Sacramento,'' said Davis, who
had shed his customary suit and tie for cowboy boots, khaki pants
and an Oxford shirt. ``You're not going to take a back seat to
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he would appoint Valley representatives to state
agencies and commissions, and deliver more funding for education
and other programs. Lungren has said he will work to settle
long-ignored disputes over water and suburban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates support the creation of a 10th University of
California campus, at Merced. Davis has said the campus could help
attract high-tech jobs to diversify the area's economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Valley largely has been left out of the state's
booming economy. Many cities there have double-digit unemployment,
high crime rates and higher-than-average illiteracy and teen-age
pregnancy rates.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists believe Lungren has an edge in the
Central Valley, where GOP registration has risen from one-third of
voters two decades ago to 42 percent today. Democrats make up 44
percent of registered voters, but the party traditionally has a
lower turnout.
</P>
<P>
   The past two Democratic nominees, Kathleen Brown and Dianne
Feinstein, fared poorly in the Valley. But Davis' advisers note
that he has won in the Central Valley in three previous statewide
races _ twice for controller, once for lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   The Davis campaign manager, Garry South, said Davis' pro-death
penalty, tough-on-crime positions and support of veterans rights
appeal to some conservatives. Democratic Party strategist Bob
Mulholland said Davis also could be helped by the Valley's growing
population of Hispanics, who traditionally favor Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But Brent Paris, executive director for the Stanislaus County
Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said: ``Assuming the Hispanic
electorate will go for the Democrats 100 percent is incorrect. ...
They're making choices based on what they think will be best for
their families and for them.''

CHILLER THEATER FOR PRIMATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1969, Richard Zanuck was trying hard to sign up Charlton
Heston for a sequel being made by 20th Century Fox, which was run
by Zanuck. A year earlier, Heston had starred as the astronaut
Taylor in Fox's highly successful ``Planet of the Apes.'' Now his
services were badly needed for ``Beneath the Planet of the Apes,''
the second installment of what would become a five-film series.
</P>
<P>
   Heston, however, felt that for him another ape movie would be
one too many. Or at least another complete ape movie. ``I owed Dick
one on this,'' he said in an interview this week. ``So I told him,
`I'll be in the first scene, then you kill me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Zanuck agreed, with one adjustment. ``Dick came back with, `How
about you disappear in the first scene, then we kill you in the
last scene?' '' Heston said.
</P>
<P>
   This week Fox issued ``Planet of the Apes'' in a
30th-anniversary edition, along with its four sequels and a fine
two-hour documentary about the making of all of them called
``Behind the Planet of the Apes.'' As for Heston's Taylor in
``Beneath the Planet of the Apes'' (1970), he was vaporized on cue
at the finale by a doomsday device that Taylor, perhaps taking no
chances, detonated himself.
</P>
<P>
   Later the eons-long battle for control between man and the
lesser (or was it superior?) primates would rage on without him in
``Escape From the Planet of the Apes'' (1971), ``Conquest of the
Planet of the Apes'' (1972) and `'Battle for the Planet of the
Apes'' (1973).
</P>
<P>
   Like most sequels, none of them ranked with the original.
Adapted from the novel by Pierre Boulle and tirelessly promoted by
the producer Arthur P. Jacobs, ``Planet of the Apes'' was to prove
a tour de force for its time. At first, though, Hollywood ran the
other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Arthur went around peddling the film, he got laughed out
of every studio office in town,'' Heston said. ``They called it a
Saturday morning serial; said it was ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics attributed the film's success to its premise (that a
breed of advanced apes had taken control of primitive humans, who
in turn once had been superior to the apes), the flexible and
lifelike prosthetic masks worn by the apes, Franklin Schaffner's
exacting direction and to the larger-than-life presence of Heston.
</P>
<P>
   During production the worry had been that audiences would laugh
at the apes. But the call of the ram's horn (just one of the
distinctive devices in Jerry Goldsmith's famous score) still sends
chills as the gorilla cavalry, fearsome creatures in black leather,
swoop down on their human quarry.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was Zanuck who took a chance on the film, which
cost $6 million to make. ``There's high risk in any project,'' he
said this week. ``The apes made it entertaining. That really was
lessening the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven years after ``Planet of the Apes,'' Zanuck produced
``Jaws.'' No one was entirely sure what the reaction would be there
either. ``Until we saw it in front of an audience, we were scared
to death the audience would laugh at the shark,'' he said. ``You
never know how people are going to respond.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Apostle
</P>
<P>
   Robert Duvall's performance as the evangelist preacher Euliss
(Sonny) Dewey neatly sidesteps standard depictions of such
characters. Sonny is no angel, but when marital problems prompt him
to whack his wife's lover with a baseball bat, he flees to a tiny
town in Louisiana and settles down to hard work and joyful
preaching.
</P>
<P>
   As the film's director, Duvall stays in pace with leisurely
small-town Southern life, but, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York
Times, the accomplishment here is ``a full, fiery, warts-and-all
portrait of Sonny without reducing him to any kind of
stereotype.'' &QL;

   Set in a nameless Latin American country, John Sayles' film
explores the facelessness of a civil war that could be taking place
anywhere. At an advanced point in his career, Dr. Humberto Fuentes
(Federico Luppi) journeys into rural areas to learn what became of
the young doctors he trained for duty there.
</P>
<P>
   The quest leads to combatants in a struggle for causes they are
asked to commit atrocities for but ultimately know little about. To
stress the depth of misunderstanding, Sayles directs the film in a
half-dozen languages, but his story is told ``so exactingly that
there is no true language barrier at all'' (Janet Maslin). &QL;

   An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn

   Having always flouted the Hollywood power elite, the
screenwriter Joe Eszterhas shoots his own brand of humor in the
foot with an idea that is decidedly unfunny. A pseudonym used by
filmmakers who want their names off the credits, Smithee in this
case is a real director (Eric Idle) who, attended by a pack of
slick studio jackals, deliberately destroys his own blockbuster
when he sees it running amok.
</P>

 &HT;    PHYSICIAN SUICIDE BILL COULD HARM PATIENTS, PANEL WARNS
 &HT;    By DANIELLE SHOOK
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bill intended to prevent physician-assisted
suicides by prohibiting the dispensing of large doses of pain
medication would instead harm patients who need strong pain relief,
a panel of health care specialists said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation introduced by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and Sen.
Don Nickles, R-Okla., would authorize the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration to investigate whenever a physician is alleged to
have prescribed a controlled drug _ such as morphine _ with the
``intent'' of assisting a suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The DEA also would have the power to revoke physicians' DEA
registration, impose large fines, and arrest them.
</P>
<P>
   The medical community is so afraid of the mere hint of a DEA
investigation that physicians and pharmacists would avoid
prescribing strong pain medication to avoid the cost, time, stigma
and adverse publicity stemming from such a probe, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason why a patient should have to wait for pain
medication, but many do,'' said Skip Baker, president of the
American Society for Action on Pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this bill passes, it will become difficult for me and
millions of others to get adequate pain medication. For some, it
will become impossible,'' said Baker, who takes a daily pain
medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a severe pain sufferer can't get the medication they
need, many commit suicide, die of heart attacks or strokes, or
suffer inhuman, unbearable pain that you can't even imagine unless
you've been there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Bennett, president of the American Society of Pain
Management Nurses, said she has seen the ``physical and mental
relief'' from pain medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a great job to tell America 'just say no,' but
there are times when you have to 'just say yes,''' she said.

 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia is running out of options as it seeks to claw
its way out of an ever-widening financial swamp.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid bankruptcy, the government devalued the national
currency last Monday(Aug.17), allowing the ruble to decline against
the dollar by as much as 34 percent. It also announced a 90-day
moratorium on Russian commercial firms and banks repaying their
debts to banks abroad.
</P>
<P>
   It is a risky gamble intended to give President Boris Yeltsin's
government the cash and the time to tackle a gloomy array of
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's sapped financial markets virtually have ceased to
exist, its banking system is near collapse, its public debt on
borrowing from foreign banks is out of control and unpaid wages to
millions of workers is growing.
</P>
<P>
   To find a lasting fix, analysts said, Yeltsin's government, led
by Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, must fundamentally transform
the economy from the unpredictable hybrid of Soviet-era
centralization and profiteering capitalism it has become.
</P>
<P>
   It means a radical overhaul to improve tax collections, reduce
government spending and somehow win back the confidence of foreign
investors. At stake is the future of Russia and Yeltsin's now
time-worn promise when the Soviet Union collapsed seven years ago
that his people would enjoy the fruits of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the critical list. There is no more waiting,'' said
Sergei Kolmakov, a Russian political and economic analyst. ``Russia
cannot cut itself off from the world markets, but it has
demonstrated that (under the current system) it cannot keep up with
them either.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Kremlin has bounded in pinball fashion from
crisis to crisis, unable or unwilling to focus on the basic
reforms, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   In July, a $22.6 billion bailout package forged by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) was intended to see that Russia
enacted long-overdue reforms to improve tax collections and lower
its budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials also intended it to avert a devaluation,
allowing them to maintain virtually the only economic boast Yeltsin
could claim: a stable ruble and low inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But the first IMF installment, $4.8 billion in July, didn't go
far. Russia had to keep spending from its hard-currency reserves to
make its debt payments, and could have soon gone bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   After a rebuff last weekend from the IMF, the United States and
other Western governments for more aid, Russian officials chose to
seek a measured devaluation, allowing the currency to float on the
market from its previous high of 6.2 rubles to the dollar to as
high as 9.5 rubles to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing the deficit is vital, analysts said. The huge
government shortfalls that force Russia to borrow from foreign
banks at high interest rates produce an accumulated debt that
demands $1 billion a week in payments.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit also has meant Russia is unable to pay full wages
and pensions to millions of its citizens, triggering strikes by
miners and other laborers throughout the nation this summer. Unpaid
wages grew to $11 billion at the beginning of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Billions of dollars in taxes go uncollected every year. And as
part of the strings attached to the IMF loans, Yeltsin's government
agreed to pursue an austerity program designed to produce another
$16 billion in revenue next year.
</P>
<P>
   But tackling Russia's deeper problems has been troublesome given
the political opposition of the Communist-dominated parliament, and
the economic interests of a small group of powerful Russian
business magnates who oppose more state control over big business.
</P>
<P>
   In emergency session in July, the Duma, parliament's lower
house, rejected 11 of 25 government-sponsored bills aimed at
raising more tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma, which convened again Friday(Aug. 21) in emergency
session, expressed concern over the new troubles, but showed little
inclination to go along with Yeltsin's plans.
</P>
<P>
   But the tax problem is not merely a matter of raising rates or
of finding the cheats. It requires a basic change in the way most
Russians conduct their daily business.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by the tax authority estimated that up to 58
percent of retail transactions occur in cash and barter, a shadow
economy almost impossible for tax collectors to penetrate.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated $1 billion a year alone in uncollected tax revenues
is lost in the illegal sale of alcohol, primarily vodka smuggled
from abroad or produced by homemade distillers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more troubling long-term problems, according to Anders
Aslund, a former adviser to the Russian government who now works
for the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, is a weak banking system
and punishing tax rate that fails to promote small businesses and
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the country's wealth in the hands of a relatively
few powerful men, Russia has been unable to diversify its economy.
</P>
<P>
   It depends heavily on oil and natural gas exports, which have
been hit by flat prices on the world market, hovering at
10-year-lows. The government said the value of oil exports in the
first half of 1998 decreased 46 percent from 1997, compounding the
country's financial woes.
</P>
<P>
   Devaluation could give the Yeltsin government the time and the
momentum it needs to pursue its reforms.
</P>
<P>
   But the alternative result of devaluation could be chaos, a
Indonesian-style free-fall that results in social unrest and
political pressure on the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this year, as financial markets in Russia fell, the
problems were confined to the government and the elite world of
banking and finance. Now all Russians have a stake in recovery with
the devaluation of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of relative stability and low inflation,
Russians are nervously watching their rubles slide in value as
prices rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government plan will most likely solve the short-term
fiscal problem, but will open the country to the risk of
self-perpetuating inflation with all its social and political
consequences,'' said Radoslav Petkov of the Institute for East/West
Studies, a think thank.
</P>
<P>
   If devaluation doesn't work, Russia has nowhere else to turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't rush to buy dollars. If you and me and everyone rushes
to swap national currency for foreign we really will destroy the
ruble,'' the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda urged its readers the
day after devaluation was announced. ``There will be no one but us
to blame.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia is running out of options as it seeks to claw
its way out of an ever-widening financial swamp.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid bankruptcy, the government devalued the national
currency last Monday(Aug.17), allowing the ruble to decline against
the dollar by as much as 34 percent. It also announced a 90-day
moratorium on Russian commercial firms and banks repaying their
debts to banks abroad.
</P>
<P>
   It is a risky gamble intended to give President Boris Yeltsin's
government the cash and the time to tackle a gloomy array of
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's sapped financial markets virtually have ceased to
exist, its banking system is near collapse, its public debt on
borrowing from foreign banks is out of control and unpaid wages to
millions of workers is growing.
</P>
<P>
   To find a lasting fix, analysts said, Yeltsin's government, led
by Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, must fundamentally transform
the economy from the unpredictable hybrid of Soviet-era
centralization and profiteering capitalism it has become.
</P>
<P>
   It means a radical overhaul to improve tax collections, reduce
government spending and somehow win back the confidence of foreign
investors. At stake is the future of Russia and Yeltsin's now
time-worn promise when the Soviet Union collapsed seven years ago
that his people would enjoy the fruits of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the critical list. There is no more waiting,'' said
Sergei Kolmakov, a Russian political and economic analyst. ``Russia
cannot cut itself off from the world markets, but it has
demonstrated that (under the current system) it cannot keep up with
them either.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Kremlin has bounded in pinball fashion from
crisis to crisis, unable or unwilling to focus on the basic
reforms, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   In July, a $22.6 billion bailout package forged by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) was intended to see that Russia
enacted long-overdue reforms to improve tax collections and lower
its budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials also intended it to avert a devaluation,
allowing them to maintain virtually the only economic boast Yeltsin
could claim: a stable ruble and low inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But the first IMF installment, $4.8 billion in July, didn't go
far. Russia had to keep spending from its hard-currency reserves to
make its debt payments, and could have soon gone bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   After a rebuff last weekend from the IMF, the United States and
other Western governments for more aid, Russian officials chose to
seek a measured devaluation, allowing the currency to float on the
market from its previous high of 6.2 rubles to the dollar to as
high as 9.5 rubles to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing the deficit is vital, analysts said. The huge
government shortfalls that force Russia to borrow from foreign
banks at high interest rates produce an accumulated debt that
demands $1 billion a week in payments.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit also has meant Russia is unable to pay full wages
and pensions to millions of its citizens, triggering strikes by
miners and other laborers throughout the nation this summer. Unpaid
wages grew to $11 billion at the beginning of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Billions of dollars in taxes go uncollected every year. And as
part of the strings attached to the IMF loans, Yeltsin's government
agreed to pursue an austerity program designed to produce another
$16 billion in revenue next year.
</P>
<P>
   But tackling Russia's deeper problems has been troublesome given
the political opposition of the Communist-dominated parliament, and
the economic interests of a small group of powerful Russian
business magnates who oppose more state control over big business.
</P>
<P>
   In emergency session in July, the Duma, parliament's lower
house, rejected 11 of 25 government-sponsored bills aimed at
raising more tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma, which convened again Friday(Aug. 21) in emergency
session, expressed concern over the new troubles, but showed little
inclination to go along with Yeltsin's plans.
</P>
<P>
   But the tax problem is not merely a matter of raising rates or
of finding the cheats. It requires a basic change in the way most
Russians conduct their daily business.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by the tax authority estimated that up to 58
percent of retail transactions occur in cash and barter, a shadow
economy almost impossible for tax collectors to penetrate.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated $1 billion a year alone in uncollected tax revenues
is lost in the illegal sale of alcohol, primarily vodka smuggled
from abroad or produced by homemade distillers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more troubling long-term problems, according to Anders
Aslund, a former adviser to the Russian government who now works
for the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, is a weak banking system
and punishing tax rate that fails to promote small businesses and
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the country's wealth in the hands of a relatively
few powerful men, Russia has been unable to diversify its economy.
</P>
<P>
   It depends heavily on oil and natural gas exports, which have
been hit by flat prices on the world market, hovering at
10-year-lows. The government said the value of oil exports in the
first half of 1998 decreased 46 percent from 1997, compounding the
country's financial woes.
</P>
<P>
   Devaluation could give the Yeltsin government the time and the
momentum it needs to pursue its reforms.
</P>
<P>
   But the alternative result of devaluation could be chaos, a
Indonesian-style free-fall that results in social unrest and
political pressure on the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this year, as financial markets in Russia fell, the
problems were confined to the government and the elite world of
banking and finance. Now all Russians have a stake in recovery with
the devaluation of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of relative stability and low inflation,
Russians are nervously watching their rubles slide in value as
prices rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government plan will most likely solve the short-term
fiscal problem, but will open the country to the risk of
self-perpetuating inflation with all its social and political
consequences,'' said Radoslav Petkov of the Institute for East/West
Studies, a think thank.
</P>
<P>
   If devaluation doesn't work, Russia has nowhere else to turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't rush to buy dollars. If you and me and everyone rushes
to swap national currency for foreign we really will destroy the
ruble,'' the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda urged its readers the
day after devaluation was announced. ``There will be no one but us
to blame.''

HARD BARGAIN: BUYING A BABY, SELLING A SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stockard Channing does not look at home in a Louisiana trailer
park. Which is a point ``The Baby Dance'' wants to make. There she
is, as Rachel Luckman, a well-dressed Hollywood executive, making
her way through the trash-strewn yards, fending off barking dogs,
avoiding the stares of half-naked men who are working on a car.
</P>
<P>
   Finally she reaches the trailer of Al LeFauve (Richard
Lineback), an unemployed pipe fitter, and his wife, Wanda (Laura
Dern), who is very pregnant with their fifth child. Rachel is there
to buy their baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Baby Dance,'' which has its premiere on Showtime on Sunday
night, shows us just what an agonizing, invasive and ultimately
soul-destroying process that kind of transaction can be. The film,
written and directed by Jane Anderson, based on her 1989 play, is
alternately funny and poignant.
</P>
<P>
   As Hollywood white collar and Shreveport blue collar eye each
other with polite words barely disguising mutual horror, the story
teeters constantly on the brink of the ridiculous. But thanks to
Ms. Anderson's restrained directing style and to strong, sure
performances by this cast (including Peter Riegert as Rachel's
husband, Richard), the film hangs onto its dignity.
</P>
<P>
   And the final scenes are as heart-wrenching as screen
storytelling can be, made all the more powerful by the comic
encounters that preceded them.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel and Richard have come to Shreveport for a first meeting
with Wanda and Al, who answered their ``baby wanted'' ad and have
contracted to give up their child for adoption by the Luckmans.
</P>
<P>
   The two women start out politely. Rachel brings flowers to Wanda
and says, ``Isn't this lovely?'' as she enters the cramped, hot
trailer. Wanda brings out a cold-cut plate with white bread for
lunch. But the trouble has already begun.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel and Richard had sent the LeFauves $500 to buy an
air-conditioner, but the money has been spent elsewhere. Wanda is
smoking, drinking coffee and not taking the prenatal vitamins that
Rachel had recommended. And Rachel's question about whether Wanda
might have ever considered an abortion prompts a rather basic
discussion of religion.
</P>
<P>
   Wanda just wants to be sure that the Luckmans do ``go to
church.'' The next thing you know, Rachel, who is Jewish, is
promising to celebrate Christmas with the child and in the spring
to observe Easter as well as Passover.
</P>
<P>
   As Rachel is waxing poetic about the universality of the seder
as a celebration of freedom, Wanda interrupts her with ``Well, will
you still have chocolate bunnies and jelly beans and all?''
</P>
<P>
   If Laura Dern plays one more white-trash Southerner this
effectively (``Rambling Rose,'' ``Citizen Ruth''), her fans are
going to forget she grew up privileged in Hollywood. And although
Ms. Channing is in ``Six Degrees of Separation'' mode as a
sophisticate of good will who enjoys her own clever remarks, she is
heartbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   The scene in which Rachel rests her head on Wanda's stomach to
listen to her future daughter's heartbeat and whisper the name she
has chosen could have been maudlin, but Ms. Channing turns it
around.
</P>
<P>
   The scene in which Ms. Channing spies Wanda's 12-year-old
daughter in the backyard _ long, silky, golden hair flowing and
catching the sunlight as she does cartwheels _ could easily have
come across like Humbert Humbert's first glimpse of Lolita.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Channing makes it pure. And when Ms. Dern then remarks,
``Now you know what the girls look like,'' her voice conveys all
the bitterness and the loss of the pact she has made with the
Devil.
</P>
<P>
   The film is far from perfect. There are a few truly terrible
lines like Riegert's to Lineback in the hospital just before the
baby's birth: ``You always have the advantage over me, my friend.
You have the ability to make life.''
</P>
<P>
   But the production designer, Brent Thomas, has a real eye for
rural squalor. And if the joke is on the poor couple _ ridiculing
their home, their language, their taste _ the Luckmans are
eventually shown to have numerous flaws of their own. One very
significant flaw, in fact, reveals itself at the end.  &QL;

NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES RECOMMENDS FOOD SAFETY CZAR 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To reduce the threat of food-borne illness, the
National Academy of Sciences on Thursday recommended the
appointment of an official with the power to manage federal
food-safety programs now run by 12 government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The new food czar would preside over such federal food-safety
activities as inspection, surveillance, investigation of
food-related illnesses, research and education.
</P>
<P>
   ``This recommendation envisions an identifiable, high-ranking,
presidentially appointed head who would direct and coordinate
federal activities and speak to the nation, giving federal
food-safety efforts a single voice,'' the academy said in a
194-page report.
</P>
<P>
   The organization is a private, non-profit research group here
that advises the government on scientific and health issues.
</P>
<P>
   Its report _ ``Ensuring Safe Food From Production to
Consumption'' _ concluded that food-safety laws are outdated and
that efforts to rid the food supply of contamination are hampered
by a fragmented federal structure.
</P>
<P>
   But the academy did not recommend merging the 12 agencies that
oversee food-safety programs. The responsibilities of those
agencies are spelled out in 35 federal laws.
</P>
<P>
   The food-safety system in the United States ``stands out as a
patchwork quilt rather than a seamless network,'' said John C.
Bailar III, chairman of the Department of Health Studies at the
University of Chicago, who headed the 13-member scientific panel
that wrote the report.
</P>
<P>
   Bailar, who spoke at a news conference Thursday, said the
``fragmentation and outdated safety laws that are still in effect
are barriers to improving the safety of the food supply.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailar said Congress should grant the person in charge of ``an
intergrated federal system'' the ``authority, responsibility and
resources'' to do the job. He added that this person should rank
above heads of the other agencies such as the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The report urged Congress to eliminate carcass-by-carcass
inspection of meat and poultry and replace it with scientific
testing for disease-causing germs.
</P>
<P>
   It also recommended a single set of regulations for all foods,
replacing the current patchwork of rules.
</P>
<P>
   Under present practice, for example, the pepperoni line in a
pizza factory is inspected daily by the Agriculture Department
while the cheese line is checked once in 10 years by the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   Bailor said ``one of several possibilities'' for improving food
safety would be creating a single food-safety agency.
</P>
<P>
   The food industry reacted to the report by lambasting any
recommendation for restructuring the food regulatory system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calling for a wholesale reorganization of federal
bureaucracies in Washington will not do anything to ensure the
safety of our food supply,'' said Cal Collier, senior vice
president and general counsel for Kraft Foods Inc., who chairs a
food industry group called the Food Safety-Independent Food Agency
Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   The report also urged Congress to allow food imports only from
those countries with safety standards equaling those in the United
States. President Clinton has endorsed the proposal, and Sen.
Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., has introduced legislation requiring such
a rule.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., and Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J.,
and Reps. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., and Frank Pallone, D-N.J., have also
sponsored legislation that would combine the 12 government agencies
into a single Food Safety Administration. But that proposal has
faced resistance from the food industry and from the federal
agencies that now oversee food safety.
</P>
<P>
   Fazio hailed the academy's report as ``common-sense
recommendations that will improve our food safety system.''
</P>
<P>
   Durbin's spokeswoman, Melissa Merz, said, ``The message in the
report is clear that American consumers and families will benefit
from a single, coordinated approach to food safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of food safety for the Center
for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington advocacy group,
said a food-safety czar with power over the budgets of food safety
agencies would be a good interim step, but is ``not the final
answer to the food safety problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Short of the president of the United States, no one is really
in charge of the safety of the U.S. food supply,'' DeWaal said. ``I
don't see how a single person can really run the program unless
there is a single food safety agency.'
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, the key investigative arm of
Congress, has estimated that contaminated food causes 9,100 deaths
and as many as 81 million illnesses a year in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal of the American Medical Association has predicted
that disease outbreaks from food-borne germs are likely to increase
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The $350,000 NAS study was financed with funds in the 1998
Department of Agriculture spending bill.

KENNEDY CENTER NAMES 6 PERFORMANCE HONOREES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Please use this version)  
 (af)  
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Shirley Temple, the little girl who saved a movie
studio from failure during the Depression, and Willie Nelson, who
helped reinvent country music, were among six people named Thursday
to receive the Kennedy Center's annual honors in the performning
arts.
</P>
<P>
   The others are the actor-comedian Bill Cosby, the Broadway
song-writing team of John Kander and Fred Ebb, and Andre Previn,
the composer, conductor and pianist, whose first opera, ``A
Streetcar Named Desire,'' will have its premiere at the San
Francisco Opera on Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   They will be honored at a gala at the Kennedy Center on Dec. 6,
which will be shown on CBS later that month.
</P>
<P>
   Because the award is for lifetime achievement, the recipients
are in their 60s and 70s. But although she is 70, Shirley Temple
Black is permanently engraved in the American memory as the little
moppet whose smiling optimism helped the nation through the weary
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   That memory is caused partly by her retirement from the movies
after appearing in ``A Kiss for Corliss'' when she was 21. She
appeared in 40 movies in the 1930s, before she was 12, including
``Little Miss Marker'' in 1934, the same year that she sang ``On
the Good Ship Lollipop'' in ``Bright Eyes.'' Darryl F. Zanuck said
that her movies saved his studio, 20th Century-Fox, from
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   She is remembered as well for sparkling tap dancing scenes with
Bill ``Bojangles'' Robinson, the great black dancer, at a time when
the movies did not allow close contacts between whites and blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know about that until I was 7 years old,'' Mrs. Black
said Thursday from her California home, discussing the country's
race relations problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I got a cold, the studio would send me to Palm
Springs, where I stayed at the Desert Inn,'' she said, with Bill
Robinson joining her to teach her dance steps for their next movie.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Which cottage are you in?' I asked him,'' she said, ``and he
answered, `You don't need to know, darling.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When she pressed him, she recalled, he answered: ``I am in the
chauffeur's cottage over the garage. But don't you worry about it.
I'm there with (italics)my(end italics) chauffeur.''
</P>
<P>
   Kander, the music writing half of Kander and Ebb, is 71 and has
been the professional partner of Ebb, 63, for half his life _ since
1962, a year otherwise notable for his Broadway debut as the
composer for ``A Family Affair,'' which flopped.
</P>
<P>
   Every New Yorker hums their ``New York, New York,'' and most
people everywhere are familiar with their other hits, like
``Cabaret,'' ``How Lucky Can You Get,'' ``Maybe This Time'' and
``All That Jazz.''
</P>
<P>
   Their shows include ``Cabaret'' and ``Chicago,'' both of which
are now enjoying successful revivals; ``Kiss of the Spider Woman''
and, for those with long memories, ``Flora, the Red Menace,'' in
which the teen-aged Liza Minnelli made her Broadway debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like people to think of me as a good carpenter,'' Kander
said from his home in Manhattan Thursday. ``Being a good craftsman
means more to me than anything else. I take that very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to name other such craftsmen, he replied: ``Like
Stravinsky, like Gershwin, like Steve Sondheim, Jerome Kern, Jerry
Bock.'' It is very unglamorous, to be wonderful at your craft.''
</P>
<P>
   Cosby, who is 61, has been an influential performer for many
reasons, not the least being his role as co-star, with Robert Culp,
in the 1060s television series ``I Spy,'' in which he became the
first black actor to play the lead role in a weekly series.
</P>
<P>
   He achieved even greater success in the highly rated ``Cosby
Show'' and is known as well for his stand-up comedy, his comedy
records and his best-selling books.
</P>
<P>
   Previn, 69, has ranged from jazz to classical music, with
Hollywood film scores in between. He was born in Berlin and fled
from the Nazis with his family to the United States in 1939. He was
working as an orchestrator for M-G-M while still in high school.

   What do normal people feel is the main relief provided by the
end of the Cold War? It is that the danger of nuclear war is off
their backs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet today, ``weapons of mass destruction'' present more and
different things to worry about than during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   For one, nuclear arms are no longer a paramount concern, but
chemical and biological weapons have come to the fore. For another,
there is less danger of complete annihilation, but more danger of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Cold War is over and American and Russian nuclear
inventories are much smaller, there is less chance of an
apocalyptic exchange of many thousands of weapons. But the
probability that some smaller number of lethal weapons will be used
is growing.
</P>
<P>
   The points to keep in mind about the new world of mass
destruction are the following.
</P>
<P>
   _ First, the roles such weapons play in international conflict
are changing. They no longer represent the technological frontier
of warfare. Increasingly, they will be weapons of the weak states,
poorer countries or groups that militarily are at best
second-class.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, the mainstays of Cold War security policy _ deterrence
and arms control _ are not what they used to be. Some new threats
may not be deterrable, and the role of arms control in dealing with
weapons of mass destruction has been marginalized. In a few
instances, continuing devotion to deterrence and arms control may
have side effects that offset the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   _ Third, some of the responses most likely to cope with the
threats in novel ways will not find a warm welcome. The response
that should now be the highest priority is one long ignored,
opposed, or ridiculed: a serious civil-defense program to blunt the
effects of WMD if they are unleashed within the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most effective measures to prevent attacks within
the United States may also challenge traditional civil liberties if
pursued to the maximum. And the most troubling conclusion for
foreign policy as a whole is that reducing the odds of attacks in
the United States might require pulling back from involvement in
some foreign conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   American activism to guarantee international stability is,
paradoxically, the prime source of American vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   This was partly true in the Cold War, when the main danger that
nuclear weapons might detonate on U.S. soil sprang from strategic
engagement in Europe, Asia and the Middle East to deter attacks on
U.S. allies. But engagement then assumed a direct link between
regional stability and U.S. survival.
</P>
<P>
   The connection is less evident today, when there is no globally
threatening superpower or transnational ideology to be contained _
only an array of serious but entirely local disruptions. Today, as
the only nation acting to police areas outside its own region, the
United States makes itself a target for states or groups whose
aspirations are frustrated by U.S. power.
</P>
<P>
   When nuclear weapons were born, they represented the most
advanced military applications of science, technology, and
engineering. None but the great powers could hope to obtain them.
By now, however, nuclear arms have been around for more than half a
century, and chemical and biological weapons even longer.
</P>
<P>
   They are not just getting old. In the strategic terms most
relevant to American security, they have become primitive.
</P>
<P>
   Once the military cutting edge of the strong, they have become
the only hope for so-called rogue states or terrorists who want to
contest American power.
</P>
<P>
   The Persian Gulf War of 1991 demonstrated the American advantage
in a manner that stunned many abroad. Although the U.S. defense
budget has plunged, other countries are not closing the gap. U.S.
military spending remains more than triple that of any potentially
hostile power and higher than the combined defense budgets of
Russia, China, Iran, Iraq, North Korea and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling along in what some see as a revolution in military
affairs, American forces continue to make unmatched use of
state-of-the-art weapons, surveillance and information systems, and
the organizational and doctrinal flexibility for managing the
integration of these complex innovations into ``systems of
systems'' that is the key to modern military effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   More than ever in military history, brains are brawn. Even if
hostile countries somehow catch up in an arms race, their military
organizations and cultures are unlikely to catch up in the
competence race for management, technology assimilation and combat
command skills.
</P>
<P>
   If it is infeasible for hostile states to counter the United
States in conventional combat, it is even more daunting for smaller
groups such as terrorists. If the United States is lucky, the
various violent groups with grievances against the American
government and society will continue to think up schemes using
conventional explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Few terrorist groups have shown an interest in inflicting true
mass destruction. Bombings or hostage seizures have generally
threatened no more than a few hundred lives. Let us hope that this
limitation has been for a powerful underlying reason, rather than a
simple lack of capability, and that the few exceptions do not
become more typical.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sure reason to bet on such restraint. If terrorists
decide that they want to stun American policymakers by inflicting
enormous damage, low-tech weapons of mass destruction become more
attractive at the same time that they are becoming more accessible.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, nuclear weapons were the bedrock of
American war capabilities. They were the linchpin of defense
debate, procurement programs and arms control because the United
States faced another superpower _ one that conventional wisdom
feared could best it in conventional warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Today, no one cares about the MX missile or B-1 bomber, and
hardly anyone really cares about the Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty. In a manner that could only have seemed ludicrous during
the Cold War, proponents now rationalize the $2 billion B-2 as a
weapon for conventional war.
</P>
<P>
   What military planners are interested in is how to keep
adversaries from using low-tech weapons of mass destruction as an
``asymmetric'' means to counter U.S. conventional power, and how to
protect U.S. ground and naval forces abroad from WMD attacks.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the primary risk is not that enemies might lob some
nuclear or chemical weapons at U.S. armored battalions or ships,
awful as that would be. Rather, it is that they might attempt to
punish the United States by triggering catastrophes in American
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Chemicals are far more widely available than nuclear weapons
because the technology required to produce them is far simpler, and
large numbers of countries have undertaken chemical weapons
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Would the United States follow through and use nuclear weapons
against a country or group that had killed several thousand
Americans with deadly chemicals? It is hard to imagine breaking the
post-Nagasaki taboo in that situation. But schemes for conventional
military retaliation would not suffice without detracting from the
force of American deterrent threats.
</P>
<P>
   There would be a risk for the United States in setting a
precedent that someone could use any sort of weapons of mass
destruction against Americans without suffering similar destruction
in return. Limiting the range of deterrent alternatives available
to U.S. strategy will not necessarily cause deterrence to fail, but
it will certainly not strengthen it.
</P>
<P>
   One simple fact should worry Americans more about biological
than about nuclear or chemical arms: unlike either of the other
two, biological weapons combine maximum destructiveness and easy
availability. Nuclear arms have great killing capacity but are hard
to get; chemical weapons are easy to get but lack such killing
capacity; biological agents have both qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear weapons are not likely to be the ``WMD of choice'' for
non-state terrorist groups. They require huge investments and
targetable infrastructure, and are subject to credible threats by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   An aggrieved group that decides it wants to kill huge numbers of
Americans will find the mission easier to accomplish with anthrax
than with a nuclear explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of those who dealt with nuclear-weapons policy
during the Cold War adamantly opposed developing first-strike
options. Today, scarcely anyone looks to that old logic when
thinking about rogues or terrorists, and most hope to be able to
mount a disarming action against any group with highly lethal
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   As threats of terrorism are taken more seriously, interest will
grow in preemptive defense measures _ the most obvious of which is
intensified intelligence collection.
</P>
<P>
   Where this involves targeting groups within the United States
that might seem to be potential breeding grounds for terrorists,
controversies will arise over constitutional limits on invasion of
privacy or search and seizure.
</P>
<P>
   So long as the danger remains hypothetical, such controversies
will not be easily resolved. They have not come to the fore so far
because U.S. law enforcement has been unbelievably lucky in
apprehending terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   For the West, it is too late to turn off foreign resentments by
retreating, even if that were an acceptable course. Alienated
groups and governments would not stop blaming Washington for their
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Security is not all of a piece, and survival is only part of
security. But it is no longer prudent to assume that important
security interests complement each other as they did during the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The interest at the very core _ protecting the American homeland
from attack _ may now often be in conflict with security more
broadly conceived and with the interests that mandate promoting
American political values, economic interdependence, social
Westernization and stability in regions beyond Western Europe and
the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should not give up all its broader political
interests, but it should tread cautiously in areas _ especially the
Middle East _ where broader interests grate against the core
imperative of preventing mass destruction within America's borders.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Completing a long and winding career journey from
outlaw Texas troubadour to mainstream cultural icon, Willie Nelson
was named Thursday as a winner of the 1998 Kennedy Center Honors _
the nation's highest award for lifetime achievement in the
performing arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 65-year-old singer, songwriter, guitarist, and actor
remains a restlessly creative soul,'' declared James A. Johnson,
chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Nelson, recipients to be honored at the Kennedy
Center's 21st annual national celebration of the arts are Bill
Cosby, Shirley Temple Black, composer and conductor Andre Previn
and the Broadway composer and lyricist team of John Kander and Fred
Ebb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised,'' said Nelson, reached on the road again. He
spoke by phone from his tour bus in Boulder, Colo., where he is
promoting a new album. ``I'm really in there with a nice group of
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his legal scrapes over marijuana and taxes as well as
for his unmistakable voice and classic compositions, Nelson was
asked if he ever thought his career would be capped by such a tony
award.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' he laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's recipients included Lauren Bacall, Charlton Heston
and Boy Dylan. Earlier Kennedy Center Awards have gone to Bob Hope,
Lucille Ball, Johnny Carson, Frank Sinatra, Cary Grant, Ray
Charles, Katherine Hepburn, Paul Newman and Aretha Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said this year's recipients are equally as deserving.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the unique and invaluable contribution they have made to
the cultural life of our nation,'' said Johnson, ``we honor a comic
genius who has touched millions, two men who together make up the
longest-running partnership in Broadway musical history, a man who
gave a restless new power to country music, a complete musician
whose gifts to us have ranged from chamber music and opera to the
best of jazz and film scores and an actress, who as a child star,
defined an era with her warmth and vitality.''
</P>
<P>
   The honorees will be saluted by their peers at a gala
performance on Dec. 6, which will be attended by President Clinton
and Hillary Rodham Clinton as well as artists from around the
country. The program will be broadcast on CBS television shortly
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a good show,'' said Nelson. ``I'm looking forward
to going there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the two-hour telecast has received the Emmy award five
times. The Kennedy Center Honors recipients are recognized for
lifetime contributions to American culture through the performing
arts.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing its 1998 honors, the Kennedy Center called Nelson
``one of contemporary music's rare genuine icons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His music helps us to know what we are as Americans and where
we came from,'' the Center announced.
</P>
<P>
   Born on April 30, 1933, in Abbott, Texas, Nelson got his first
guitar at the age of six and grew up on the music of fellow Texans
Bob Wills and Ernest Tubbs. Four decades ago, he made his initial
impact on country music as a Nashville songwriter of such classics
as ``Crazy,'' ``Night Life'' and ``Funny How Time Slips Away.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Nelson headed home to Texas and led the ``outlaw''
movement of rollicking, honky-tonk music, recording hit albums
including ``Shotgun Willie,'' ``The Red-Haired Stranger'' and
``Wanted: The Outlaws.'' At the end of the decade, though, he
abruptly changed directions with the the album ``Stardust'' _ a
collection of pop standards.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Nelson embarked on an acting career _ appearing in movies
``Thief,'' ``The Electric Horseman,'' ``Honeysuckle Rose'' and,
most recently, ``Wag the Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, he has toured almost constantly _ sending fans
to their feet with the opening chords of ``Whiskey River.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie Nelson helped reinvent country music,'' proclaimed the
Kennedy Center announcement. ``Throughout his career, he has not
only entertained, but he has given us part of our heritage.''

</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised,'' said Nelson, reached on the road again. He
spoke by phone from his tour bus in Boulder, Colo., where he is
promoting a new album. ``I'm really in there with a nice group of
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his legal scrapes over marijuana and taxes as well as
for his unmistakable voice and classic compositions, Nelson was
asked if he ever thought his career would be capped by such a tony
award.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' he laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's recipients included Lauren Bacall, Charlton Heston
and Boy Dylan. Earlier Kennedy Center Awards have gone to Bob Hope,
Lucille Ball, Johnny Carson, Frank Sinatra, Cary Grant, Ray
Charles, Katherine Hepburn, Paul Newman and Aretha Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said this year's recipients are equally as deserving.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the unique and invaluable contribution they have made to
the cultural life of our nation,'' said Johnson, ``we honor a comic
genius who has touched millions, two men who together make up the
longest-running partnership in Broadway musical history, a man who
gave a restless new power to country music, a complete musician
whose gifts to us have ranged from chamber music and opera to the
best of jazz and film scores and an actress, who as a child star,
defined an era with her warmth and vitality.''
</P>
<P>
   The honorees will be saluted by their peers at a gala
performance on Dec. 6, which will be attended by President Clinton
and Hillary Rodham Clinton as well as artists from around the
country. The program will be broadcast on CBS television shortly
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a good show,'' said Nelson. ``I'm looking forward
to going there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the two-hour telecast has received the Emmy award five
times. The Kennedy Center Honors recipients are recognized for
lifetime contributions to American culture through the performing
arts.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing its 1998 honors, the Kennedy Center called Nelson
``one of contemporary music's rare genuine icons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His music helps us to know what we are as Americans and where
we came from,'' the Center announced.
</P>
<P>
   Born on April 30, 1933, in Abbott, Texas, Nelson got his first
guitar at the age of six and grew up on the music of fellow Texans
Bob Wills and Ernest Tubbs. Four decades ago, he made his initial
impact on country music as a Nashville songwriter of such classics
as ``Crazy,'' ``Night Life'' and ``Funny How Time Slips Away.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Nelson headed home to Texas and led the ``outlaw''
movement of rollicking, honky-tonk music, recording hit albums
including ``Shotgun Willie,'' ``The Red-Haired Stranger'' and
``Wanted: The Outlaws.'' At the end of the decade, though, he
abruptly changed directions with the the album ``Stardust'' _ a
collection of pop standards.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Nelson embarked on an acting career _ appearing in movies
``Thief,'' ``The Electric Horseman,'' ``Honeysuckle Rose'' and,
most recently, ``Wag the Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, he has toured almost constantly _ sending fans
to their feet with the opening chords of ``Whiskey River.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie Nelson helped reinvent country music,'' proclaimed the
Kennedy Center announcement. ``Throughout his career, he has not
only entertained, but he has given us part of our heritage.''

INFINITI G20 A SOLID CAR, BUT UNDER POWERED  
 (EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE SATURDAY, AUG. 22) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - The Infiniti G20 is back, rising from the dead for a
return engagement this fall as the non-luxury model of Nissan's
luxury division.
</P>
<P>
   The G20 is a sporty sedan aimed directly at BMW 3-series fans,
but at a more moderate price. It serves as Infiniti's
``entry-level'' craft and replaces the former G20 that was axed a
couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The new G20, like the former model, hits the mark in many
respects, providing a midpriced car that benefits from a load of
standard luxury equipment as well as Infiniti's vaunted customer
service.
</P>
<P>
   But also like the former G20, the new model suffers from a lack
of engine power, which wouldn't be so bad, except that it shares
its four-banger with less-prestigious Nissan subcompacts, leaving
one to ponder whether this Infiniti is just a dolled-up Nissan
after all.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the G20's not even a new car, being basically a rebadged
Primera, which Nissan has sold in Europe for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   And why is it that Nissan/Infiniti, currently enduring a dismal
sales year and struggling to get some notice for its moribund
product line, would reintroduce a car with such generic styling?
From some angles, the G20 looks like a BMW. From others, like a
pint-size Volvo. Or even G20's country cousin, Sentra.
</P>
<P>
   Come on, designers, you want the G20 to step out from the crowd,
not blend into it. Just look at Chrysler's comeback from the very
brink: Much of its newfound success can be laid at the feet of
stylists who were not afraid to push the design envelope to the
limits.
</P>
<P>
   The result is booming sales and a company that's the envy of
all, enough so that Mercedes-Benz would get down on one knee and
propose merger.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of leading-edge styling that the G20 should be
strutting. The same kind of stuff that made the world take notice
of the little Altima just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the G20 fails to excite. Plenty of people will like
this car, especially because of its excellent handling and
driveability. But no one's going to look at this car and say,
``Gotta have it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad, because the G20 has a lot going for it. With a
five-speed stick shift, one can wring some juice from the
dual-overhead-cam, 2-liter engine as it climbs in rpm. Performance
is smooth all the way up to its steep 7,000 rpm redline, which
along with its fine handling makes the little sedan feel like a
well-turned-out sports car.
</P>
<P>
   Where the engine feels weak is in the lower rpm, such as when
coming out of a sharp corner. Though I didn't try one with
automatic, I'd imagine the performance would be disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Handling and driving character have been improved greatly with a
stiffer chassis and better suspension components. Though the former
independent rear suspension has been replaced with a beam axle, the
G20 proves to be an aggressive performer when it comes to twisty
roads, combining flat, balanced cornering with a compliant,
comfortable ride.
</P>
<P>
   The Touring version I drove was set up with lower-profile tires,
limited-slip differential, fog lights and a jazzy spoiler.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is comfortable and roomy, for a small car, though
tall drivers might find legroom kind of tight. The G20 is a few
inches longer and wider than its predecessor, which seems to have
created more space inside. The cabin feels well-thought-out and
nicely designed, seemingly more European than Japanese, probably
because of its Primera roots.
</P>
<P>
   The optional leather seats in our test car were smooth and
supportive.
</P>
<P>
   The Bose stereo system is an excellent value as standard
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The G20's only direct competition is the Acura Integra, which
holds a similar position as moderate-priced entry into a Japanese
luxury marque. The Integra has been endowed with more style and
character, though it's not as tight and sporting as the G20.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the G20 is a good little car, well-equipped for the
money, and as driveable as many of the upper-crust Europeans. Too
bad Infiniti didn't give it a bit more engine.
</P>
<P>
   And too bad the designers didn't see fit to give the G20 the
distinctive styling that it deserves, something that would make
people turn and take notice, something that would shout: ``Hey, I'm
back!'' &QL; 
 &QL;

 &HT;    Fly right: Hire a plane to take in McKinley
 &HT;    By James D. Smith
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALKEETNA, Alaska _The drone of single-engine airplanes taking
off from Talkeetna State Airport sounds like the hungry buzzing of
an Alaska-sized army of mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   For days the pilots have been restricted because of poor flying
conditions in the area around Mount McKinley, North America's
highest peak. Now that the clouds are lifting, they're eager to get
back in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Located 100 miles north of Anchorage and 135 miles south of the
entrance to Denali National Park, the airport in this small
community of mom-and-pop shops and eateries has become a center for
McKinley sightseeing and mountaineering activities. Alaskans call
it ``flightseeing,'' and given the rugged vastness of the state's
terrain, it's a smart way to cover a lot of territory in a short
time.
</P>
<P>
   You can take your pick from several services, all of which offer
several options, based on length of flight and whether a glacier
landing is included. Prices, according to brochures that can be
picked up at the Talkeetna Ranger Station, run from $75 for a
one-hour round trip that gives you a closer aerial view of the
mountain to $185 for a two-hour trip around the top of 20,320-foot
McKinley. My wife and I chose a 2 1/2-hour flight that circled
McKinley at a ``mere'' 12,000-feet but included a landing on the
Ruth Glacier, costing us $175 each.
</P>
<P>
   The grandeur of hundreds of square miles of green forest
interspersed with meadows, lakes and muskegs _ the Alaskan swamp or
bog, a favorite haunt for moose, bears and other wildlife _ spreads
out beneath you at liftoff. In the distance, 50 miles to the north,
loom the soaring peaks of the Alaska Range and, towering above them
all, Mount McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   Talking to you on headsets, which also cut down on cabin noise,
your pilot provides a running commentary and answers questions.
You'll also be able to listen to other air traffic as pilots call
in their positions and chat with each other.
</P>
<P>
   On the longer flights, you'll eventually be surrounded by jagged
peaks as your small plane darts in and out of the folds of the
mountains, bringing you face to face with McKinley before
catapulting you around to the other side of the mountain. During
summer, it's likely at some point that you'll see a thin black line
of mountaineers snaking their way along a ridge as they head to the
mountain's summit.
</P>
<P>
   Because conditions around McKinley can change rapidly _ the
mountain creates its own weather _ it's the pilot's call on whether
to attempt a glacier landing.
</P>
<P>
   Obtaining a favorable report on conditions, our pilot set us
down. Manually lowering our plane's skis into position (after
warning us not to be alarmed by the noise they make), he glided us
down to a smooth landing.
</P>
<P>
   It's exhilarating.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping onto the glacial ice, we were thrust into a snow-white
world lined with jagged peaks, stabbing the deep-blue sky like the
spines of a giant dragon's tail. After 30 minutes or so of photo
taking and ``gee-whizzing,'' we reluctantly clambered back into the
plane for the return trip.
</P>
<P>
   Booking a flightseeing trip is easy enough. Many services have
toll-free numbers and Web sites. There's also a commercial visitor
information center at the junction of the Parks Highway and the
Talkeetna Spur Road, the only road leading into Talkeetna.
</P>
<P>
   While reservations are recommended, my wife and I simply showed
up and put our name on a waiting list at K2 Aviation, the second
air service we visited (the first was too backlogged trying to get
climbers down off the mountain to deal with a couple of walk-ups),
and checked back several hours later as instructed after having
lunch and touring the town's gift and souvenir shops.

 &HT;    Intrepid hikers forge through a glacier-strewn, glorious summer
landscape
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 23: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANCHORAGE, Alaska_There were nine of us, all strangers who would
become close friends _ possibly for life _ in less than a week.
</P>
<P>
   We slogged through shoulder-high foliage to get to Ptarmigan
Lake near Moose Pass, Alaska, 100 miles south of Anchorage. We
switchbacked up rocky slopes so steep we had to hug the ground to
keep from sliding hundreds of feet to the base of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   There were days when a brisk and sometimes abrupt and biting
July wind threatened to slam us to the ground as we navigated
strenuous, and often treacherous, hikes through snow and along ice
fields. Layer upon layer of clothing warmed us.
</P>
<P>
   That's summer hiking in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Two guides from Timberline Adventures, a Denver outfitter,
waited for us in the lobby of an Anchorage hotel for the start of a
lodge-to-lodge trip that would take us via van 130 miles south to
Seward through towns with names such as Moose Pass and Aleyeska, on
hikes along the Iditarod Trail to Crows Pass and for a boat trip on
the Gulf of Alaska past blue-tinted glaciers that thundered when
sections broke away.
</P>
<P>
   The water was battleship-gray. The flowers, in fields edged with
ice fields, were in bloom. The Alaskan king crab legs awaiting us
at dinner were huge.
</P>
<P>
   The tourist season is short, usually June through August. Often,
space is scarce; a trip halfway around the Northern Hemisphere
should be booked several months in advance, so fall is the best
time to plan.
</P>
<P>
   But once you make plane reservations and book a date with an
outfitter (there are several that lead hikers and bikers through
Alaska), all you have to do is show up; the outfitters make all the
arrangements for meals, hotels or camp sites and transportation. In
addition to hiking and biking, some outfitters schedule at least a
day of rafting or kayaking, boating to a glacier or taking a ride
on the Alaska Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   Our first hike was along the Coastal Trail, within the city
limits of Anchorage but seemingly in a wilderness. Aside from the
bald eagle sightings _ and the breathtaking scenery of a place
where everything seemed larger that anywhere else in the United
States _ the easy walk along Cook Inlet bore little resemblance to
the more demanding hikes we would take over the next five days.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the week, the routine was to put together our
own lunches using the supply of sandwich makings the guides
provided, hike three or four hours, eat our sandwiches, cookies,
trail mix and chips at the end of the trail, then retrace our
steps.
</P>
<P>
   Like the first walk, the second day's 15-mile trek started out
with our being surrounded by grass and flowers. Our hike began at
the Glenn Alps trail head in Chugach State Park and headed up
Powerline Pass just outside Anchorage. The temperature was in the
mid-60s. The trail was relatively flat until we reached a
10-foot-wide stream, almost knee deep, that we had to ford
barefoot.
</P>
<P>
   That was where things changed abruptly.
</P>
<P>
   Green turned to brown. Wind gusts threatened to blow us over.
And the spongy path lined with ice and snow seemed to head straight
up.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us made it to the top and to the edge of Ship Lake for a
view of the Chugach range, while a few chose to huddle behind
boulders, away from the cold wind.
</P>
<P>
   Day three found us on the Iditarod Trail, heading toward Crows
Pass. Many started in T-shirts and shorts only to have added layers
of sweaters and fleece by the time we'd reached a Forestry Service
hostel halfway up the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   The trail took us across three steams that started with water
from melting glaciers, past the remnants of an abandoned gold mine,
across snow bridges tipped perilously at 45-degree angles and a
switchback of rock and dirt that was so narrow it barely allowed
room for one person to pass. But once at the top of Crows Pass,
from a snowy bluff tinted red with algae, we could look down on
Raven Glacier, a mountain of ice covering thousands of acres far
below.
</P>
<P>
   Our fourth full day of hiking took us to Ptarmigan Lake, part of
Chugach National Forest, which abuts the state park. We had no snow
or steep climbs. No wind either, but an almost constant drizzle.
And instead of making our way across rock, we bushwhacked through
shoulder-high grass and ferns.
</P>
<P>
   One by one we skirted a swift stream, passing prickly bushes we
were warned not to touch. The guides didn't know the name of the
shrubs, which have a bite that's sharp and often infectious. Three
hours later, our clothes wet and our boots filled with water, we
reached quiet and isolated Ptarmigan Lake, gray from mountain
runoff.
</P>
<P>
   The last hike, at Kenai Fjords National Park, was the most
difficult but by far the most spectacular _ hiking from the base of
Exit Glacier to the edge of the Harding ice field, named for
President Warren G. Harding, who died in Alaska after eating
tainted seafood.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the trail was nothing more than rocks stacked one atop
the other and moraines, narrow ledges that mark various natural
boundaries formed as the glacier receded over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Marmots darted in and out of the boulders along the path, afraid
to get too close but curious about the traffic through their world.
Mountain sheep chewed on flowers and grass uphill from a path lined
with snow.
</P>
<P>
   Some 3,100 feet from where we started was an ocean of ice 35
miles long and 20 miles wide surrounded by mountains that literally
appeared purple.
</P>
<P>
   The hugeness of everything made whispering seem more appropriate
if it was absolutely necessary to speak.
</P>
<P>
   -- Information: A number of outfitters lead hikes through
Alaska. The cost varies with the amenities offered. The charge for
the Timberline Adventures hike was at the low end, at $1,395 for
six days and five nights. For a similar trip that is a day longer,
Backroads charges $2,198. Among the outfitters to consider:

 &HT;    Tourists, at long last, observe science in action at Seward
research station
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 23: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie

<P>
   SEWARD, Alaska _It's breakfast time in this northern hamlet of
mountain and ocean, time for a bucket of herring between buddies.
Dennis Christen carries the salty morning morsels _ served over ice
_ through a labyrinth of laboratory hallways until he reaches the
shores of the Alaska SeaLife Center. Two slick-brown flippers
emerge from a concrete pool, followed by the 580-pound bulk of
Woody the sea lion, who sniffs the air for the familiar fishy
scent.
</P>
<P>
   Like a daily exchange between teacher and favorite student,
Christen calls out a few friendly salutations before beginning the
feeding/training session. With wide eyes and whiskered chin
pointing skyward, Woody intently watches Christen's hand gestures
and obeys, barring his teeth for a brushing, then lying down on a
rope to have girth and blubber density measured. Christen wings a
few herring Woody's way, along with a soothing chorus of ``Good
boy, Woody, that's a g-ooo-ooo-d boy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Alaska SeaLife center, which opened in May, was created to
help endangered sea creatures like Woody. It took one of mankind's
worst affronts to the ocean to spur the building of a
state-of-the-science facility for rehabilitating and researching
marine mammals. Penalties of $37.5 million paid by Exxon Corp.
after it spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil into Alaskan
waters nine years ago provided the bulk of construction money for
the $52 million, 115,000-square-foot SeaLife Center.
</P>
<P>
   Blackening 1,600 miles of Alaska's south-central coast and
islands and contaminating and killing thousands of birds and
animals, the Exxon Valdez oil spill was precisely what many
residents had predicted if a tanker ever ran aground in Prince
William Sound: disaster.
</P>
<P>
   While the black muck did not foul the beaches of Seward, the
town got deeply involved _ fashioning one of many makeshift
stations for cleaning slicked and sick sea otters and birds.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for this unique blend of mammal research and
rehabilitation center had been discussed in the state for three
decades, long before the 1989 disaster that confirmed the need for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Seward lobbied hard for the facility for many reasons. It
already had a small oceanography research center operated by the
University of Alaska at Fairbanks that had outgrown its tanks and
labs. It also wanted a big draw to encourage cruise ships to dock
awhile longer, and for tourists to drive from Anchorage, about 125
miles north. Geology gave Seward an edge. Although surrounded by
glaciers and mountains, its deep harbor is always ice-free,
allowing for year-round research in and out of the water.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in Seward, a town of 3,000, approved $17 million in
revenue bonds for construction costs, and residents raised $6
million in private donations. It was a classic grass-roots effort:
$1 million alone came from perpetual bake sales and relentless
door-to-door campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   The SeaLife Center's $6.25 million annual operating budget is
almost entirely dependent on gate receipts and gift shop sales. The
center's 250,000 yearly visitation projections _ considered wishful
thinking by some _ appear to be on track. Only 10 weeks after
opening day, the center's 100,000th visitor tipped the turnstyle.
Tourism throughout Alaska is strongest mid-May to mid-September,
when coastal towns such as Seward swarm with day-trippers from
cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   But playing the odds comes naturally to Alaska towns,
particularly those that have survived earthquakes (Seward was
rocked by North America's worst in 1964), tidal waves, golddiggers,
get-rich dreamers, gamblers, thieves _ and oil spills. Such is the
history of Seward, founded by Russian Alexander Baranov, who sailed
into the bay out of a storm on Easter Sunday 1781. The beautiful
blue-green harbor came to be known as Resurrection Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Research first, then tourism
</P>
<P>
   Tucked between ocean and mountains, glaciers and gold rush
trails, the SeaLife Center gives visitors a window to the sea. It
is designed to be two parts research and animal rehabilitation and
one part tourist attraction. But it's tourism without any tricks.
There are no hourly shows featuring jumping seals or swirling sea
lions. No little fish for sale to feed the big critters. The
emphasis is on education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're merging the outside with the inside,'' executive
director Kim Sundberg says. ``You see a king crab exhibit and
you're sitting right on the edge of the water where they fish for
them. You take a tour boat and see the sea lions in the wild and
then come back to the SeaLife Center and you're looking that sea
lion in the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   On exhibit now are three Steller sea lions, eight harbor seals,
15 river otters and dozens of seabirds. More injured or sick
smaller animals may be rehabilitated here, but no additional large
marine mammals are expected as permanent residents.
</P>
<P>
   The facility is two stories high, with the first-floor
laboratories closed to the public but open for viewing from large
windows on the second floor. From this perch, visitors can peer
down into large stalls where various animals may be getting poked
and prodded for measurements, blood specimens or for other
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scientists are on display just like the animals,'' jokes
research director Michael Castellini, one of 60 full-time
employees. ``That was an important aspect of the design of the
SeaLife Center. The permits we have for these animals are
exclusively research permits, not aquarium permits.''
</P>
<P>
   Data of every conceivable kind are recorded, computed and
categorized. Blubber density. Tooth and beak growth. Fur thickness.
Stool counts.
</P>
<P>
   Two wet labs feature rows of ceiling showerheads that could
shoot gallons of salt water on animals slicked by oil or other
contaminants. There are also four dry labs, an autopsy room and
areas devoted to fish genetics. Staff and visiting researchers take
on as many as 15 simultaneous animal studies.
</P>
<P>
   Steller sea lions are a special focus. Since the 1970s,
scientists have been baffled by the animals' dramatic population
decline in Alaskan waters, the primary habitat in the world for
these massive, energetic mammals that are often dubbed bears of the
sea. Declared endangered, the population of Steller sea lions in
Seward's Kenai Peninsula region has fallen from 150,000 to 25,000.
Theories about the decline abound: a drop in food supply; ecosystem
changes; habitat intrusion. But there has been no easy way to
research these animals since few are in captivity and those in the
wild are too aggressive and unwieldy to study _ although that
hasn't deterred a determined league of marine biologists from
trying.
</P>
<P>
   Since transferring Woody and two other Stellers in March from
Vancouver Aquarium in British Columbia, where they'd been raised as
pups, Christen is making progress on this uncharted man-mammal
bond. Christen, 25, relocated from the Vancouver Aquarium to stay
with the mammals he met as part of a high school science honors
program. That launched his career in marine mammal training.
</P>
<P>
   ``In nature, these animals are very aggressive,'' Castellini
says. ``The fact that Dennis can have them trained for research
protocols is extremely impressive. He can ask them to get in a
cage: Give a hand signal, and they do it. Nowhere else in the world
is that done.''
</P>
<P>
   One study alters diets of the sea lions to look for differences
between them and their wild counterparts. Scientists theorize
ecosystem changes have forced Steller sea lions to switch from once
abundant and healthy herring to a steady diet of pollock, fish that
Castellini considers ``junk food of the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Steller sea lions can grow to 1,500 pounds and 9 feet in length.
Since March, Woody has gained 200 pounds, more than the females
Sugarloaf and Kiska. (Woody, for now, must be separated from the
girls because of stirring teenage hormones _ researchers don't want
to deal with pregnant animals just yet.)
</P>
<P>
   Stellers are not California sea lions, a smaller, more docile
animal and the ones trained to balance balls on their snouts in
aquarium performances. ``California sea lions are the border
collies,'' Christen says, ``while Stellers are the bull mastiffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Taming and training them not only takes buckets of
positive-reinforcement herring but a positive approach, Christen
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm of a very firm belief that if you're positive and upbeat
when dealing with them, they'll respond. You have to be able to
motivate them to cooperate. A lot of this research stuff is boring
to them, so you need to be happy and upbeat. If you're having a bad
day, you have to put that aside when working with them because they
can read you very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Close to nature
</P>
<P>
   Wraparound windows on the ocean accent the slate-gray stone
building located at the end of Seward's main commercial street,
Fourth Avenue. Jagged peaks of the Chugach Mountains rise behind
the center, and sailboats and sea otters play in the bay.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping inside the glass entrance, visitors first see a
dangling Dall's porpoise. These black and white carvings, the work
of local artist Jim Ramsdell, hang from the ceiling, in pursuit of
smaller fish. And inside them is a bit of local history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote a poem for the porpoise,'' Seward sixth-grader Sean
Chase says. ``It's a time capsule, and our school put pictures,
poems and letters inside the mom porpoise's belly.'' Then, like the
rest of the local kids touring their world-class backyard
attraction, the 12-year-old scampers off for yet another ride up
the first escalator in this part of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   A visitor's tour is predetermined at the SeaLife Center,
beginning with a progression of exhibits encountered as you step
off the escalator on the second floor (providing, of course, the
first-floor gift shop is saved for last).
</P>
<P>
   An optional short video on sea mammals leads to the first
hallway of exhibits _ small displays of jellyfish and kelp, and an
explanation of the life cycle of Coho salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Next comes a separate room devoted entirely to explaining the
Valdez oil spill, its cleanup and long-term damage to wildlife and
the shoreline. Lifesize cutouts of people affected by the spill,
and those participating in the cleanup _ such as fishermen (and
women) and Alaskan natives _ explain the consequences of that
fateful night in large text displays. Extensive photographs and
maps line the walls. Simple, concise descriptions of the day-by-day
spreading of the spill provide an easy-to-understand synopsis of a
complex situation.
</P>
<P>
   This is the only place Exxon is mentioned at the facility, even
though $37.5 million in oil company settlements helped build the
center. For some, this exhibit may seem packed with images already
seen and known the world over: pitiful sea otters, sad-eyed seals,
blackened birds. But it also leaves a lasting impression on many,
especially school and youth groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the oil spill, even though I was only 7 years old
at the time,'' says Quincy Opdycke, a 16-year-old from Fairbanks'
Frontier High School. ``If they're going to make a mistake that
big, they need to make an even bigger contribution to fix it and to
prevent it from ever happening again.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Dustin Farnum, owner of an Anchorage communications
company, ``This exhibit is pretty upfront about the whole oil
spill. It tells you exactly what is known and unknown ... even what
Exxon doesn't want you to know.''
</P>
<P>
   After the reality check of the oil spill display comes the
center's ``Please Do Touch'' exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Intertidal creatures _ sea stars, sea urchins and other
invertebrates _ hang out in an open tank called the Discovery Zone.
Here, visitors dip their hands in the salt water and examine the
bright undersides of the ``stars of the sea,'' such as sunflower
star, true star, vermillion star and leather star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, this one isn't spiny. It's kind of hairy,'' one boy tells
his less-enthralled mom upon picking up a snail-like creature
called a hairy triton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, are these good to eat?'' another curious kid asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, sir,'' volunteer Lani Lockwood patiently replies.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the Discovery Zone is another discovery zone of sorts,
the viewing windows into the research labs below and to backyard
tanks and concrete pools where the seals and sea lions are
sometimes kept when being studied.
</P>
<P>
   The tour then moves to the large habitats of the sea lions,
seals and sea birds. The animals are free to romp in and out of
their tanks and around rocks sculpted to resemble Resurrection
Bay's coastline. Nearby, puffins, murres and other birds flutter
around the burrows in their screened-in quarters. At the sea lion
and seal habitats are several indoor and outdoor observation
points; the birds can be seen from afar along the edge of their
habitat.
</P>
<P>
   From here, visitors descend into the exhibit ``Denizens of the
Deep,'' which is the underwater view of the second-story sea lion
and seal habitats. From this vantage point, animals and humans
enjoy the view of each other through laminated glass encasing the
100,000-gallon tank.
</P>
<P>
   The area outside the tanks allows ample elbow room for excitable
kids and baby-strolling parents. Here, children could spend hours
communing with the noses and faces of chocolate-brown seals and sea
lions.
</P>
<P>
   That was the scene in May when Seward residents got a sneak
preview. Kids and their parents couldn't seem to tear themselves
away from watching Woody and his two sea lion gal pals, Kiska and
Sugarloaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wonderful for the kids, '' said Debbie Darakas,
who was touring with her son and his friends while on a break from
her nearby Greek restaurant, Apollo. ``We've been waiting for this
all to come together for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   However, some local residents are concerned tourists will travel
to this far-flung Alaska town only to be disappointed by the
center's style _ which is long on lessons but short on souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not Sea World,'' says Barbara Fleming, one of the
center's 100 volunteers. ``I think that will be the biggest
misperception to overcome. Visitors look at the (EKG heart) patches
on the seals and wonder why we're doing that to them. ... The
animals just happen to be cute.''
</P>
<P>
   Seward Mayor Bob Satin, who also doubles as a ranger at nearby
Kenai Fjords National Park, believes those tourists will ``get
educated despite their preconceived notions.''
</P>
<P>
   Over a typical Last Frontier lunch of reindeer sausage, hold the
mustard, Satin says, ``You know, this is an amazing effort for this
size community. I think there are still some people who believe
we'll fall flat on our face. But this is Alaska. Here, we make big
things happen.''

FOX TAKES EARLY AIM AT FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By TV's strange system of reckoning, fall begins Sunday. True,
most of the networks' prime-time shows will be premiering nearer
the week of Sept. 21 _ the official start of fall for ratings
purposes. Fox, however, hopes to hook viewers with an early look at
its revised Sunday lineup.
</P>
<P>
   For those not paying attention, Fox is moving its popular
animated comedy, ``King of the Hill,'' to Tuesdays in a bid to
jump-start a loser night. Fox is also trimming ``The World's
Funniest . . . '' to a half-hour, maybe less, depending on how long
Sunday football runs.
</P>
<P>
   Taking up the slack are two new comedies that will bookend ``The
Simpsons.'' On one end, at 7:30, is ``Holding the Baby,'' an
American treatment of a British sitcom. After ``The Simpsons'' (and
before ``The X-Files'') comes ``That '70s Show,'' a puckish paean
to a mellower time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That '70s Show'' is from the creators of ``3rd Rock from the
Sun,'' and it has the same roguish sense of fun without as much
over-the-top silliness. It focuses on a superbly cast ensemble of
actors who play six teenagers in the safely suburban enclave of
Point Place, Wis. Five of them are locals, the sixth an exchange
student from, well, no one is quite sure. Neither social outcasts
nor A-list regulars, they fall neatly into that big in-between
where most teens dread to be seen. Their hangout is the basement of
Eric Forman's house, where they spend most of their time doing _ or
thinking about doing _ whatever their parents told them not to do.
</P>
<P>
   Drinking, drugs and disobedience pop up in episode one, to the
dismay of some fun-busters who've questioned the wisdom of
highlighting bad behavior without including repercussions. The
producers say that won't always be the case, but let's hope they
don't lose sight of that eerie disconnect that encompassed the
'70s. From snips of the Captain &AMP; Tennille to reminders on the
versatility of Vienna sausages, ``That '70s Show'' is unbelievably
believable.
</P>
<P>
   Topher Grace, a newcomer to TV, plays Eric Forman with such ease
that it's hard to believe he's acting. And Laura Prepon, another TV
newbie, is a star in the making as Eric's best friend, Donna
Pinciotti. Though they're only a month apart in age, Donna is
physically and intellectually more mature, leading to wonderfully
awkward moments between the two.
</P>
<P>
   They and their friends _ dim bulb Michael (Ashton Kutcher),
annoying Jackie (Mila Kunis), suspicious Steve (Danny Masterson)
and wide-eyed Fez (Wilmer Valderrama) _ are a gourmet assortment of
mixed nuts who put a smiley face on some well-written,
well-directed material.
</P>
<P>
   The single-parent gambit, meanwhile, is played for the zillionth
time in ``Holding the Baby,'' but it does have a certain charm.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Patrick Walker plays newly single dad Gordon Stiles with an
American sort of Hugh Grant dash. Jennifer Westfeldt plays Kelly
O'Malley, a graduate student who'd like to work at Stiles' office,
but Stiles is more in need of a nanny because his wife has decided
to abandon him and their baby in a quest for inner peace with her
new lover in the Himalayas. Or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   We've seen all the situations before, but Walker, Westfeldt and
Eddie McClintock (as irresponsible brother Jimmy Stiles) seem
capable of delivering with flair. It's incumbent on the writers,
then, not to drop the baby.

<P>
   SEWARD DETAILS
</P>
<P>
   -- Welcoming tourists: A downtown trolley ($1) shuttles visitors
to hotels, restaurants, the harbor and campgrounds. An information
center in a historic railroad car offers plenty of free tourist
guidebooks. With the arrival of the SeaLife Center, hotels are
expanding, restaurants are opening and locals are converting extra
rooms to bed-and-breakfast inns.
</P>
<P>
   -- Outdoor activities: The so-called ``Alpine village by the
sea'' is an outdoor enthusiasts' paradise. Lakes and lush forests
make for great camping and exploring _ whether roughshod on
mountain bikes or in wide-load Winnebagos. The town is on
Resurrection Bay, entry to some of the most stunning coastal Alaska
scenery. Whales, sea otters, dolphins, seals and other marine
animals are easily seen year-round from all types of guided tour
boats or from kayaks, sailboats or fishing vessels, available to
rent. Call Sunny Cove Sea Kayaking Co., 907-345-5339; Sea Lion
Sports Boat Rentals, 907-224-7171; Kenai Fjords Tours,
1-800-468-8068.
</P>
<P>
   Hiking, skiing and glacier exploring are also popular (Trails
North, 907-224-3587; groups only). So is ``flightseeing,''
sightseeing by small plane and helicopter (Alaska Aerial Tours,
1-888-248-6898; Bear Lake Air &AMP; Guide Service, 1-800-224-5985).
</P>
<P>
   Also, many outfitters rent equipment and offer guide services.
Or you could let the dogs do the work. Check out dog-sled
demonstrations and rides (even when there's no snow, it's done on
wheeled sleds) at IditaRide Sled Dog Tours on Old Exit Glacier Road
(907-224-8607).
</P>
<P>
   -- Lodging (higher prices are summer rates):
</P>
<P>
   Harborview Inn: New rooms feature lovely carved wood furniture,
native art and massive stone fireplaces. Great views of Mount
Marathon. $49-$109. 1-888-324-3217.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE
</P>
<P>
   -- Car: From Anchorage, take the 125-mile Seward Highway (Alaska
1/9). The SeaLife Center is at mile 0. Spectacular views of
mountains, ice fields, forests and maybe a moose or two make this
drive a show-stopper. It's the only highway where I've ever been
stopped for driving too slow. The excuse, ``Well, I've never been
to Alaska and it's so beautiful. Guess that's why I'm driving so
slow,'' doesn't fly. The speed limit varies from 55 to 65 mph;
minimum is 45 mph but not recommended because you'll be slowing
traffic on the two-lane.
</P>
<P>
   -- Train: The Alaska Railroad runs a small train from Anchorage
to Seward daily in summer only; $40 one way. 1-800-544-0552.
</P>
<P>
   -- Ferry: Seward is on the route known as the Alaska Marine
Highway, which takes visitors by ferry along the southeastern coast
and the Kodiak and Aleutian Islands. 1-800-642-0066.
</P>
<P>
   -- Bus, fly: Seward Bus Lines runs several buses from Anchorage
daily (907-563-0800). Several one-way 45-minute flights also leave
daily (summer only) on F.S. Air (907-224-5920) and Era Aviation
(1-800-866-8394).

<P>
   In recent years terrorist operations have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Airline hijackings have become rare because hijacked planes
cannot stay in the air forever and few countries today are willing
to let them land, thereby incurring the stigma of openly supporting
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorists too saw diminishing returns on hijackings. The trend
now seems to be away from attacking specific targets such as the
other side's officials and toward more indiscriminate killing.
</P>
<P>
   The belief has gained ground that terrorist missions by
volunteers bent on committing suicide constitute a radical new
departure, dangerous because they are impossible to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   But that is a myth, like the many others in which terrorism has
always been shrouded. The bomber willing and indeed eager to blow
himself up has appeared in all eras and cultural traditions,
espousing politics ranging from the leftism of the Baader-Meinhof
Gang in 1970s Germany to rightist extremism.
</P>
<P>
   When the Japanese military wanted kamikaze pilots at the end of
World War II, thousands of volunteers rushed to offer themselves.
The young Arab bombers on Jerusalem buses looking to be rewarded by
the virgins in Paradise are a link in an old chain.
</P>
<P>
   State-sponsored terrorism has not disappeared. Terrorists can no
longer count on the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies,
but it is clear that among Middle Eastern and North African
countries, some will definitely provide support.
</P>
<P>
   Tehran and Tripoli are less eager to argue that they have a
divine right to engage in terrorist operations outside their
borders. Indeed, the 1986 U.S. air strike against Libya and the
various boycotts against Libya and Iran had an effect.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Sudan, without fanfare, has become for
terrorists what the Barbary Coast was for pirates of another age: a
safe haven. Politically isolated and presiding over a disastrous
economy, the military government in Khartoum, backed by Muslim
leaders, believes that no one wants to become involved in Sudan and
thus it can get away with lending support to terrorists from many
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Such confidence is justified so long as terrorism is only a
nuisance. But when it becomes more than that, both terrorists and
their protectors come under great international pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the past few decades have witnessed the birth of
dozens of aggressive movements espousing varieties of nationalism,
religious fundamentalism, fascism and apocalyptic millenarianism,
from Hindu nationalists in India to neofascists in Europe and the
developing world to the Branch-Davidian cult of Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier fascists believed in military aggression and engaged
in a huge military buildup, but such a strategy has become too
expensive even for superpowers. Now, mail-order catalogs tempt
militants with readily available, far cheaper, unconventional as
well as conventional weapons _ ``the poor man's nuclear bomb,'' as
former Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani once called
them.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to nuclear arms, the weapons of mass destruction
include biological agents and man-made chemical compounds that
attack the nervous system, skin or blood.
</P>
<P>
   Governments have engaged in the production of chemical weapons
for almost a century and in the production of nuclear and
biological weapons for many decades, during which time
proliferation has been continuous and access ever easier.
</P>
<P>
   The means of delivery _ ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and
aerosols _ have also become far more effective. While in the past
missiles were deployed only in wars between states, recently they
have played a role in civil wars in Afghanistan and Yemen. Use by
terrorist groups is but one step further.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1970s most observers believed that stolen nuclear
material constituted the greatest threat in the escalation of
terrorist weapons, but many now think the danger is elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorist groups have investigated the use of poisons since the
19th century. The Aum Shinrikyo cult staged a poison gas attack in
March 1995 in the Tokyo subway. Exposure to the nerve gas sarin
killed ten people and injured 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other, more amateurish attempts in the United States and abroad
to experiment with chemical substances and biological agents for
use in terrorism have involved the toxin that causes botulism, the
poisonous protein rycin (twice), sarin (twice), bubonic plague
bacteria, typhoid bacteria, hydrogen cyanide, Vx (another nerve
gas), and possibly the Ebola virus.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical agents are not so easy to keep safely in stable
condition, and their dispersal depends largely on climatic factors.
The risk of contamination for the people handling them is high.
Many of the most lethal bacteria and spores do not survive well
outside the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, traditional terrorism rests on the heroic gesture,
on the willingness to sacrifice one's own life as proof of one's
idealism. Obviously there is not much heroism in spreading botulism
or anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   Since most terrorist groups are as interested in publicity as in
violence, and as publicity for a mass poisoning or nuclear bombing
would be far more unfavorable than for a focused conventional
attack, only terrorists who do not care about publicity will even
consider the applications of unconventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Broadly speaking, terrorists will not engage in overkill if
their traditional weapons _ the submachine gun and the conventional
bomb _ are sufficient to continue the struggle and achieve their
aims.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to use terrorist violence is not always a
rational one. If it were, there would be much less terrorism, since
terrorist activity seldom achieves its aims. What if, after years
of armed struggle and the loss of many of their militants,
terrorist groups see no progress?
</P>
<P>
   Despair could lead to giving up the armed struggle, or to
suicide. But it might also lead to a last desperate attempt to
defeat the hated enemy by arms not tried before.
</P>
<P>
   As one of Racine's heroes said of himself, their ``only hope
lies in their despair.''

   &UR; How Fox Got Its Groove Back  &LR;  HOLLYWOOD _ A black flag wasn't
quite fluttering at 20th Century Fox last summer, but the mood at
the studio was decidedly bleak. ``Speed 2: Cruise Control,'' the
adventure-action sequel to ``Speed,'' was the biggest disaster of
the summer. And the studio had sunk more than $140 million into
``Titanic,'' whose cost had run amok. The word was that Rupert
Murdoch, who owns the studio, would chop off a head or two.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Like many studios in town, which go through tough times one year
and bounce back the next, Fox has returned to almost dominate the
summer season with a series of hits that were not entirely
expected, like ``There's Something About Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   William Mechanic, chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, said
that seven of eight films released by the studio in recent months
would turn a profit, the lone exception Warren Beatty's
``Bulworth,'' a political comedy that was critically acclaimed but
failed to stir much enthusiasm at the box office. The most
successful film is ``There's Something About Mary,'' the dumb but
very funny comedy that cost about $25 million and has already
grossed nearly $92 million. The film has made Cameron Diaz a star.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear we couldn't keep spending the kind of money we
were spending on movies,'' Mechanic said. ``We had to make some
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is that relatively inexpensive Fox films like ``Hope
Floats,'' ``Ever After'' and perhaps such newcomers as ``How Stella
Got Her Groove Back'' and ``Slums of Beverly Hills'' seem headed
for success. Costly movies like ``Dr. Dolittle'' and perhaps ``The
X-Files'' will also turn a profit. In the meantime, ``Titanic,''
which was also financed by Paramount, has grossed nearly $600
million in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``What have we learned this summer?'' Mechanic said. ``The
audience generally is seeking something else, something new. Look
at the success of `Saving Private Ryan.' It's clearly cutting
against the grain and is an action picture with a brain and a
voice. The success of that is positive for the whole business.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Dergarabedian, president of the Exhibitor Relations
Company, which monitors the box office, said that the lesson so far
was that summer is no longer a season when studios unload only
their big action films plus family movies, saving their more
serious films for the fall, when moviegoers are not on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Saving Private Ryan' belied that _ it's not your typical
summer action popcorn movie,'' Dergarabedian said. ``People have
now learned you can release any kind of film in the summer as long
as it's good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan,'' which was made by Dreamworks and
Paramount, cost about $65 million. Executives at both studios
privately thought at first that the Steven Spielberg World War II
drama was so intense and so long (2 hours and 40 minutes) that
audiences would shy away from it and turn to more escapist fare.
</P>
<P>
   But the film, buoyed by dazzling critical reviews, has been No.
1 at the box office for the last three weeks, is expected to gross
as much as $190 million and is probably the biggest hit of the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Snipes Does `Blade'  &LR;  Wesley Snipes says he has seen too many
of his films come and go, mostly go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walk down the street and someone says, `Hey man, I like you
as an actor, but I see some of the films you're in and you are
wacked,' '' Snipes said. ``And I say: `Hey man, I agree with you.
These weren't the films I wanted to make.'''
</P>
<P>
   So Snipes took matters into his own hands. His company, Amen Ra
Films (Afrakhan Minds Engaged N Royal Affairs), decided to produce
``Blade,'' a futuristic thriller about a vampire hunter, played by
Snipes. The action hero Blade was introduced to comic book fans in
1973 as a supporting character in Marvel Comics' ``Tomb of
Dracula,'' and over the years has become a franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Blade was a comic book superhero who had special appeal for
Snipes. ``You rarely see African-American superheroes in movies,''
he said. ``That has positive social ramifications.''
</P>
<P>
   But what especially appealed to Snipes was the degree of control
he had over the film, which is being released on Friday by New
Line. ``As an actor for hire, your job and influence are finished
once you leave the set,'' said Snipes, whose action films include
``Passenger 57,'' ``Demolition Man,'' ``Money Train,'' ``U.S.
Marshals,'' ``The Fan'' and ``Drop Zone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be disheartening, putting in four months, five months,
and then it comes out and you're not satisfied with it,'' he said.
``For this one, I wanted to have my hands on it, my spirit in it.''
</P>
<P>
   That means, Snipes said, that he was involved with the
screenplay (written by David S. Goyer) as well as the casting,
production and action sequences. ``This is the way to go for me,''
said Snipes, whose production company also made ``Down in the
Delta,'' a modest drama that marked Maya Angelou's directorial
debut and had its premiere at the recent Urbanworld Film Festival
in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Snipes acknowledged that it's sometimes frustrating to be known
as an action star, when so much of his career has rested on serious
or at least nonaction films. He starred in such dramas as
``Waterdance'' and ``One Night Stand,'' as well as Spike Lee's
``Mo' Better Blues'' and ``Jungle Fever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I play a lot of average guys; I like to play average guys, but
the trouble is people don't remember those parts,'' Snipes said.
``People are aware of the action parts because of the publicity
machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Snipes said he was uncertain about his next project. But he was
quite sure of one thing: ``It won't be an action film.''

   &UR; A Crocodile in Maine  &LR;  When Steve Miner directs a horror film
like ``Halloween: H20'' he hears movie music in his head. ``I watch
a scene unfold, and I try to play in my mind an old Bernard
Herrmann score to feel the suspense,'' said Miner, whose new film
stars Jamie Lee Curtis in the role that started her career 20 years
ago in John Carpenter's landmark original ``Halloween.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I make a horror film, I think of myself as sitting in the
audience and what would scare me,'' Miner said. ``The audience is a
partner in horror movies. The audience wants a roller-coaster ride.
You try to give it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the film's box office receipts dropped sharply in its
second week _ horror-film fans are often teen-agers who show up
over the first weekend _ the movie had already grossed more than
$40 million, making it a success for Miramax's Dimension Films.
``I'm just gratified at the reaction: we were only a blip on the
radar screen in May compared to all the big summer blockbusters,''
said Miner, 50.
</P>
<P>
   Miner spoke on the phone from Vancouver, where he is directing
``Lake Placid,'' a comedy written by David E. Kelley, one of
television's top writers, in which Bridget Fonda, Bill Pullman and
Oliver Platt deal with a 30-foot-long man-eating crocodile that
turns up in Maine. ``I guess there's one word to describe it _
quirky,''' said Miner, who has directed episodes of two of Kelley's
series, ``Chicago Hope'' and ``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Quirky can also describe Miner's career. A film buff since his
childhood in Westport, Conn., with a passion for Alfred Hitchcock,
Miner worked as a production assistant on industrial films in New
York and then joined a boyhood friend, Sean Cunningham, in helping
to make a low-budget horror film, ``Last House on the Left''
(1973). The movie was the directing debut of the horror master Wes
Craven.
</P>
<P>
   Miner and Cunningham went on to produce several other films,
notably ``Friday the 13th.'' Miner made his directing debut in
``Friday the 13th Part 2.'' Later, he moved into television,
directing the pilot for ``The Wonder Years,'' as well as the WB
series ``Dawson's Creek.'' His films include the romantic drama
``Forever Young'' (1992), starring Mel Gibson and Ms. Curtis. He
has also directed television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did everything backwards,'' Miner said with a laugh. ``I
went from features to television to commercials. I'll do student
films next.''
</P>
<P>
   Miner, who is divorced and has two children, said that directing
``Halloween: H20,'' as well as ``Dawson's Creek,'' had been of
enormous benefit to his relationship with his 14-year-old daughter,
Nina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, my daughter thinks I'm cool,'' he said.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heavy showers, gusty winds and bands of thunderstorms will
surround a disturbance Friday as it moves toward the Texas coast.
Torrential rain to will bring local flooding to parts of
southeastern Texas. Meanwhile, high pressure will keep areas from
northern Texas to the central plains hot with ample sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Limited sunshine will alternate with heavy showers and
thunderstorms over much of Florida as a weak tropical disturbance
drifts over the state. The heaviest rain is expected over central
and southern sections. Gusty onshore winds are expected along the
eastern coast. Elsewhere in the Southeast, it will be hot and
rather humid with plenty of sun, although afternoon thunderstorms
will erupt near the Gulf coast.
</P>
<P>
   A band of clouds and a few light showers will accompany a warm
front as it moves through eastern New England early Friday. A
mixture of clouds and sun will follow the front during midday,
however scattered showers will develop near the Canadian border
Friday afternoon. Most of the Northeast will be partly cloudy and a
bit more humid than recent days.
</P>
<P>
   A front from the northern Rockies to the southern Great Lakes
will be the focus for areas of showers and some thunderstorms.
Persistent clouds and a few heavy showers are expected near a jet
stream disturbance over eastern Nebraska and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the interior West will be very warm. Afternoon
thunderstorms will form over many peaks in the central and southern
Rockies. Cool air at high-levels will promote scattered showers
over the mountains of the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Born in Africa
</P>
<P>
   The disturbance that became Tropical Storm Bonnie north of the
Windward Islands on Thursday began its life in Africa. In the late
summer, dozens of clusters of thunderstorms form in the strongly
heated air near the Sahel. They travel westward in the belt of
easterly trade winds which girdle the globe within 1,500 miles of
the equator. The chilly waters near Africa's west coast are
inhospitable territory for the disturbances struggling to
strengthen. But, when the high-level winds are favorable, the
African disturbances can reach the warmer waters to the west where
hurricanes take shape. &QL;

OBSCURE REPUBLICAN FROM MISSOURI GOES ON THE ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c. 1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Monica Mess rolls on, we may be witnessing
more than the destruction of an incumbent president.
</P>
<P>
   We may be watching the making of another presidency, or at least
the making of a serious candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Sen. John Ashcroft, an obscure Republican with
presidential ambitions, has been out front day after day claiming
the moral high road, criticizing President Clinton and calling for
his resignation. Ashcroft has been interviewed so often that he is
becoming a familiar figure, not yet a household name but
considerably more recognizable than before the Monica Lewinsky
issue erupted in January.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft, of course, has nothing to lose by attacking Clinton
and potentially a great deal to gain politically. He was the first
elected Republican to declare that if Clinton was sexually involved
with a young intern, the president should resign.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the president's partial confession of a sexual
relationship, many Republican officials have remained silent to
avoid creating an appearance of too much partisan glee. House
Speaker Newt Gingrich warned fellow GOP lawmakers not to publicly
prejudge the president until Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr
submits his report on possible impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft has been joined, however, by another Republican with
presidential ambitions, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, in
pounding Clinton for reprehensible behavior. Alexander echoes
Ashcroft's call for Clinton's resignation while conceding that
removing the president would not be ``the best thing'' for the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander has been having difficulty being heard above the
political din, mostly because no one takes his candidacy seriously.
So far he is just an asterisk on the political calendar.
</P>
<P>
   But Ashcroft has evolved over recent months into a substantive
attack dog with a consistent, hard-hitting message that goes beyond
the marginal right-wing ideological issues that were his original
themes. He has found his central issue, and it is Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft has crafted criticism that portrays Clinton as an
ineffective president because he has ``lost his moral authority to
govern.'' In Ashcroft's view, Clinton is clinging to office ``at
the expense of the nation's domestic and international
responsibilities and opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The country cannot and should not be forced to engage issues
with a discredited president who cannot be completely trusted,''
Ashcroft thunders.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ashcroft may be more prescient than he could have
realized.
</P>
<P>
   In a military exercise reminiscent of ``Wag the Dog,'' a movie
in which a president invents a fake international crisis to
distract attention from a domestic scandal, Clinton has just put
our trust to an important test. On Thursday _ the very day that
Lewinsky was testifying for a second time before Starr's grand jury
_ Clinton abruptly struck suspected terrorist sites in Afghanistan
and Sudan and returned to Washington from his Martha's Vineyard
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   His timing seemed more than coincidental. Dramatically leaving
the Vineyard also had overtones of fleeing Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   The president was retaliating for the recent bombings at two
U.S. embassies, exercising his authority as commander-in-chief to
protect U.S. interests abroad. But public support for this sudden
warlike act will ultimately depend upon confidence in the sincerity
of his motives.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, there will be widespread skepticism that the
president was as eager to create a diversion as he was to smack
terrorists. It is a measure of the damage he has done to the
presidency and himself that such doubts about his credibility are
even raised on an issue as crucial as fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   It is Ashcroft's position that only by leaving the White House
can President Clinton put those doubts to rest. So long as Clinton
wields power, his motives will always be suspect. The only question
is whether such suspicions will be so debilitating that the
president cannot function, leaving us with two years of a political
vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft also has called for the president's impeachment, ``if
he has subverted the truth, if there are serious crimes of
perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft is a member of the Judiciary Committee and could play a
crucial role in any impeachment trial, should it come to that. (If
the House votes to recommend a trial in the Senate, tradition
indicates that a specially-appointed Senate committee would first
study the issue before sending it to the full Senate body for a
vote. That committee is likely to include Judiciary Committee
members.)
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft, 56, is extraordinarily ambitious for a first-term
senator, although he was seasoned by serving for two terms as
governor of Missouri. He has made a strong run at the religious
right, espousing its favorite issues, from school prayer to a ban
on abortion and elimination of the National Endowment for the Arts.
He has made some headway at winning the support of cultural
conservatives like Pat Robertson, although rivals are clamoring for
that support, too.
</P>
<P>
   One thing his ``family values'' platform can't do is snub
working women. His wife Janet is a lawyer like Hillary Clinton; she
teaches business law at Howard University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft might have a chance if the GOP presidential field
remains as crowded as it now seems. He will have to elbow his way
past the apparent front-runner, Texas Gov. George Bush, but since
neither Bush nor Ashcroft has been tested on the national stage,
what might happen is anybody's guess.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Reliance on air power has set the American way of war apart from
all others for well over half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries might field infantry, submariners or scientific
artillerists comparable in skill and numbers to America's.
</P>
<P>
   Only the United States, however, has engaged in a single-minded
and successful quest for air superiority in every conflict it has
fought since World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Air warfare remains distinctively American _ high-tech, cheap in
lives and, at least in theory, quick. To America's enemies _ past,
current and potential _ it is the distinctively American form of
military intimidation. Air warfare plays to the machine-mindedness
of American civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft can direct massive and accurate destructive force at
key points without having to maneuver cumbersome organizations on
land or sea.
</P>
<P>
   When American presidents use air power, they should either hurl
it with devastating lethality against a few targets _ say, a
full-scale meeting of an enemy war cabinet or senior military staff
_ or extensively enough to cause sharp and lasting pain to a
military and a society.
</P>
<P>
   The sprinkling of air strikes over an enemy will harden him
without hurting him and deprive the United States of an intangible
strategic asset.
</P>
<P>
   American leaders at the end of this century indeed have been
vouchsafed with a military instrument of a potency rarely known in
the history of war. But glib talk of revolutionary change obscures
the complexity of truly radical change in the conduct of war and,
worse, its inherent messiness and brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, air power is an unusually seductive form of military
strength, in part because, like modern courtship, it appears to
offer gratification without commitment.
</P>
<P>
   More than one commentator who had reservations about aerial
bombardment in the Persian Gulf War expressed a newfound belief in
its utility as a tool of U.S. foreign policy in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Lewis of The New York Times wrote during the gulf
conflict in disgust at the ruin wrought by aerial bombardment: ``We
should never again tolerate anyone who talks about `surgical
strikes.''' After that, however, he developed a keener appreciation
of air power, asserting, for example, that ``a few air strikes in
Dubrovnik'' would have stopped the Yugoslav horrors in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   It remains that many individuals came away from the gulf war
with a far healthier respect for air power, believing it had made
all the difference. Indeed it had. Some 52,000 air-to-surface
sorties delivered approximately 210,000 unguided bombs, 9,300
guided bombs, 5,400 guided air-to-surface missiles and 2,000
anti-radar missiles. American forces also hurled more than 300
cruise missiles at the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   To what effect?
</P>
<P>
   Of its 700 aircraft, the Iraqi air force lost 33 in the air;
approximately 140 perished in hardened aircraft shelters and more
than 120 were flown to Iran.

<P>
   Reliance on air power has set the American way of war apart from
all others for well over half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries might field infantry, submariners or scientific
artillerists comparable in skill and numbers to America's.
</P>
<P>
   Only the United States, however, has engaged in a single-minded
and successful quest for air superiority in every conflict it has
fought since World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Air warfare remains distinctively American _ high-tech, cheap in
lives and, at least in theory, quick. To America's enemies _ past,
current and potential _ it is the distinctively American form of
military intimidation. Air warfare plays to the machine-mindedness
of American civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft can direct massive and accurate destructive force at
key points without having to maneuver cumbersome organizations on
land or sea.
</P>
<P>
   When American presidents use air power, they should either hurl
it with devastating lethality against a few targets _ say, a
full-scale meeting of an enemy war cabinet or senior military staff
_ or extensively enough to cause sharp and lasting pain to a
military and a society.
</P>
<P>
   The sprinkling of air strikes over an enemy will harden him
without hurting him and deprive the United States of an intangible
strategic asset.
</P>
<P>
   American leaders at the end of this century indeed have been
vouchsafed with a military instrument of a potency rarely known in
the history of war. But glib talk of revolutionary change obscures
the complexity of truly radical change in the conduct of war and,
worse, its inherent messiness and brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, air power is an unusually seductive form of military
strength, in part because, like modern courtship, it appears to
offer gratification without commitment.
</P>
<P>
   More than one commentator who had reservations about aerial
bombardment in the Persian Gulf War expressed a newfound belief in
its utility as a tool of U.S. foreign policy in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Lewis of The New York Times wrote during the gulf
conflict in disgust at the ruin wrought by aerial bombardment: ``We
should never again tolerate anyone who talks about `surgical
strikes.''' After that, however, he developed a keener appreciation
of air power, asserting, for example, that ``a few air strikes in
Dubrovnik'' would have stopped the Yugoslav horrors in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   It remains that many individuals came away from the gulf war
with a far healthier respect for air power, believing it had made
all the difference. Indeed it had. Some 52,000 air-to-surface
sorties delivered approximately 210,000 unguided bombs, 9,300
guided bombs, 5,400 guided air-to-surface missiles and 2,000
anti-radar missiles. American forces also hurled more than 300
cruise missiles at the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   To what effect?
</P>
<P>
   Of its 700 aircraft, the Iraqi air force lost 33 in the air;
approximately 140 perished in hardened aircraft shelters and more
than 120 were flown to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi air-defense system succumbed within days _ really,
hours _ to an extremely sophisticated attack. It managed to shoot
down only a tiny fraction of the attacking aircraft. Moreover, air
power had completely disrupted Iraqi logistics and immobilized the
Iraqi army.
</P>
<P>
   Although ground action necessarily consummated the final victory
for coalition forces, air power had made the final assault as
effortless as a wartime operation can be.
</P>
<P>
   If the claims of air power advocates are correct, the United
States, after the gulf war, acquired a military edge over
conventional opponents comparable to that exercised in 1898 by the
soldiers of Lord Kitchener against the sword-wielding dervishes of
the Sudan.

 &HT;    Why isn't a pregnant woman's immune system attacking and
destroying fetuses?
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Georgia researchers have solved a 45-year-old riddle: Why
mothers are able to carry babies to term.
</P>
<P>
   It's an ability most people never question. Yet it has puzzled
scientists since 1953, when a British immunologist pointed out that
fetuses, being genetically different from their mothers, should be
rejected by their mothers as foreign tissue _ but they aren't.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the Medical College of Georgia and the
University of Georgia have discovered the mechanism that keeps the
mother's immune system from attacking and destroying fetuses. The
findings appear in today's issue of the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery someday could lead to new treatments for
auto-immune diseases such as juvenile diabetes, rheumatoid
arthritis and multiple sclerosis. It also might help scientists
better understand how to prevent miscarriages or rejection of organ
transplants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a rather surprising mechanism, which no one had
previously guessed at,'' said study co-author Andrew Mellor, a
molecular geneticist and immunologist at MCG in Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, a body's immune system attacks any foreign cells that
enter it. Foreign, in this case, could mean anything from
disease-causing bacteria to a life-saving transplanted organ.
</P>
<P>
   But no one considered that fetuses might also fall into this
category until 1953, when Sir Peter B. Medawar spotlighted the
apparent contradiction that mammalian fetuses survive in utero,
despite differing genetically from their mothers. Mammalian
offspring inherit genes from both parents.
</P>
<P>
   Medawar later won a Nobel Prize in medicine, but his paradox has
remained unsolved until now.
</P>
<P>
   The key lies in an enzyme, called IDO, that is created by cells
in the placenta, the membrane through which the mother delivers
nourishment to and removes wastes from the fetus. The placenta is
the barrier as well as the interface between mother and child.
</P>
<P>
   IDO acts as a sort of local anesthetic, by suppressing the
mother's immune system within the placenta. It does this by
breaking down tryptophan, an essential amino acid required by
T-cells, which orchestrate the body's immune system responses.
</P>
<P>
   Mellor and his colleagues tested their barrier mechanism theory
in mice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reasoned that when we block that mechanism, the mother
would now see the fetus as foreign tissue and reject it,'' Mellor
said.
</P>
<P>
   When the researchers inhibited the mechanism in pregnant mice,
they all miscarried.
</P>
<P>
   In another set of experiments, scientists confirmed that the
genetic differences between the mother and its fetus are
responsible for incurring rejection when the barrier mechanism
fails or is inhibited.
</P>
<P>
   To prove this, the research team used strains of mice specially
inbred to be genetically identical. They mated mice who were
essentially twins. The female mice, therefore, conceived fetuses
who also were their genetic duplicates.
</P>
<P>
   When the researchers blocked the barrier mechanism in the
pregnant mice, nothing happened. The mice carried their pregnancies
to term _ because their bodies didn't recognize the pups as
foreign.
</P>
<P>
   A final confirmation of the theory was the observation that mice
that lack immune systems were able to carry and deliver genetically
different pups. No barrier mechanism was needed in these mice,
because no immune system existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rarely, I think, do you find such clear-cut results that
absolutely agree with the hypothesis like this,'' said Emory
immunologist Judith Kapp. ``It's the kind of study we all dream
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Much more research must be done, though, to understand
specifically how the barrier mechanism works.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just at the infancy stage of doing these experiments,''
said Dr. David Munn, a pediatric oncologist at MCG who also
co-authored the study. ``We're just so floored at having found this
mechanism to investigate.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are now studying whether the barrier mechanism in
the placenta occurs elsewhere in the human body. But new treatments
based on the research are years away.

 &HT;    ``Rat Pack'' can't take you back, but you'll feel like you were
there
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They put the biz in show business. Their public lives cooked
with a pre-ironic, pre-retro gas; they were cool before it was
``cool.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rat Pack _ Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr. and
anybody else who torched a cigarette in their oxygen _ was the
Vegas version of the Kennedys' Camelot, a lifestyle that defined
its times (late '50s, early '60s) and was envied and aped right up
until ... it's time ran out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world is drunk and we're just the cocktail of the
moment, pal,'' says Martin (Joe Mantegna), the Pack's commissioner
of existential realism, in HBO's darkly mesmerizing, exquisitely
flawed resurrection that premieres Saturday night. ``One day
everybody's gonna wake up with a heck of a hangover, down two
aspirin with a glass of tomato juice and wonder what the hell all
the fuss was about.''
</P>
<P>
   You're drawn into HBO's ``The Rat Pack'' even as you notice the
nips and tucks it needed to look young again. As Sinatra, Ray
Liotta (``Goodfellas'') is a kind of early draft that hints at the
right things: the no-neck head turns, the captain-of-the-tree-fort
way he both cuts up and stays in charge of his buds. But the shadow
Liotta's Sinatra throws doesn't cover the whole room, and his thin
voice is closer to whiney than fearsome. He's more punk than thug.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly that doesn't matter. While Frank was the Chairman, the
Rat Pack was a true ensemble, and their dizzying, non-stop whirl
here keeps you from sweating the details.
</P>
<P>
   The movie compresses the Pack's ``Ocean's 11,'' Kennedy
presidential campaign heyday, and it's to this movie's credit that
the hangover Martin talks about always feels just one stiff drink
away.
</P>
<P>
   As a crew, they're on top of the world. By themselves, they
grope in the dark. Davis (Don Cheadle) is the Pack's consumate
entertainer and most convenient prop; his eternal smile is exposed
as a fierce grimmace when he marries a Swedish woman and suffers
thecultural consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Martin seems always to be wagging his head at the success of the
threesome's shallowness. He bolts parties early, sleeps alone in
his hotel bed, even as an opposite image of him expands. ``In order
to share intimate feelings you have to have intimate feelings,'' he
tells his frustrated wife.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra, meanwhile, is obsessed with Jack Kennedy, eager to work
the biggest stage of them all, as if he'll one day install the Rat
Pack in the White House as a kind of hep cat cabinet. With Kennedy
in-law Peter Lawford (Angus Macfadyen) serving as both pimp and
go-between, it's a doomed notion that the Kennedy's deftly exploit.
</P>

   All this over-reaching looks small and sad now. But ``The Rat
Pack'' also lets you know why we still remember these guys, why
they remain a kind of standard of cool we keep handy for whenever
we need a reminder of where we are.

   Air Bud: Golden Receiver G
</P>
<P>
   If you're younger than 8, this ``Bud's'' for you. In this sequel
to ``Air Bud,'' Buddy, the hoop-shooting golden retriever, and his
boy, Josh (Kevin Zegers) trade basketball for football. Scriptwise,
it's little more than a glorified after-school special, but there
hasn't been much around for younger kids recently and it handles
its messages well. And so what if the movie is essentially a series
of Stupid Pet Tricks? In his K-9 jersey, pads and helmet, Buddy
looks more athletically heroic than Bruce Willis. 1 hour, 31
minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Armageddon PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The world, interpreted as a video game. While ``Deep Impact''
treated a similar let's-save-Earth story with sobriety,
``Armageddon'' never lets the threat of global annihilation get in
the way of fun. It's a space-cowboy movie, with Bruce Willis and
Ben Affleck saving the world for Liv Tyler. As a summer popcorn
movie, it's more enjoyable than that big-lizard flick ``Godzilla.''
And you'll see the reported $165 million budget onscreen in the
impressive effects and mammoth sets. But is the movie good for you?
Probably not. Rated PG-13 for sci-fi disaster action, implied sex
and profanity. 2 hours, 24 minutes. (SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers PG
</P>
<P>
   At least visually, this update of the '60s British TV series
pays witty homage to the original's vein of Carnaby Street
surrealism. In between sips of champagne and civilized quips,
secret agents John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Mrs. Emma Peel (Uma
Thurman) foil criminals plotting against the British government.
But there are two main problems: a half-baked script and Thurman,
who is trumped by the cool, feline memory of Diana Rigg, who
originated the role. (SM) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss R
</P>
<P>
   Harmless, mildly entertaining and completely disposable, this is
the movie equivalent of Richard Simmons. A cute, funny,
romantically minded photographer named Billy (Sean P. Hayes) falls
for a gorgeous hunk (Brad Rowe) who may or may not be gay, but who
keeps himself tantalizingly available. (Though for what? Friendship
or love?) Rated R for language, sex and drug references. 1 hour, 32
minutes. (ER) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Blade R
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't cut it. Wesley Snipes stars as the half-vampire,
half-human hero who can handle sunlight but also has a taste for
blood. Armed with an arsenal of sci-fi gadgets, a really cool
leather coat and Kris Kristofferson (a kind of high-tech Gabby
Hayes), Blade is devoted to wiping out all vampires. Especially a
strutting bloodsucker played by Stephen Dorff. Alas, all the
nonstop slash 'n' gnash action becomes more repetitive than
anything else. Rated R for extreme violence and strong language. 2
hours. (ER) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Dance With Me PG
</P>
<P>
   A guilty, quick-stepping pleasure. Vanessa L. Williams plays a
Houston dance instructor who hopes to recapture past dance
competition glory with the help of a Cuban newcomer (Latin music
star Chayanne). Original it isn't, but ``Dance'' is great fun. It's
the first film that lets Williams show off her knockout dancing,
and in his first Hollywood flick, Chayanne goes for the summer's
heartthrob title. 2 hours, 6 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Deep Impact PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The impact here is human, which is pretty gutsy since, going in,
we all know this is about a giant comet hurtling toward Earth.
Director Mimi Leder harks back to 1959's ``On the Beach'' in her
determination to show that worldwide catastrophes can be measured
one human life at a time. Her strong cast is headed by Tea Leoni,
Morgan Freeman, Elijah Wood and Robert Duvall. Rated PG-13 for
violence, language and end-of-the-world jitters. 2 hours, 3
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Disturbing Behavior R
</P>
<P>
   Disturbingly lame. This teens-in-peril flick is a high-concept
pitch with zero follow-through _ it's ``The Stepford Teens'' with a
touch of ``Invasion of the Body Snatchers.'' James Marsden plays a
newcomer to a smalltown high school who encounters a band of
frighteningly clean-cut students. With the help of the school
psychiatrist (Bruce Greenwood), these fascist Archies ``recruit'' a
new classmate into their group every few days. Rated R for
profanity, violence and sex. 1 hour, 23 minutes. (SM) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dolittle PG-13
</P>
<P>
   This raucous but uninspired Eddie Murphy vehicle has almost
nothing to do with the old Rex Harrison musical. Murphy is John
Dolittle, a busy doctor who has neglected his wife (Kristen Wilson)
and his two daughters. One day, all kinds of animals start
pestering him vocally. Despite the zing of some nuttier moments,
the lame plot keeps dragging the movie to the ground. Rated PG-13
for crude humor and language. 1 hour, 30 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Ever After PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Happily, this ``Ever After'' proves you can teach an old doll
new tricks. Re-inventing the Cinderella story in a way that targets
``Titanic''-loving teens more than Barney grads, the movie stars
Drew Barrymore as its spirited heroine, Anjelica Huston as her
scheming stepmother and Dougray Scott as a prince who's more than
just another trophy husband. Jeanne Moreau, doyenne of the French
New Wave, contributes a classy cameo. Rated PG-13 for emotional
situations (death of a father) and some violence. 2 hours. (ER)
Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Everest NR
</P>
<P>
   Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX format may gasp
at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' This 44-minute documentary
was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that killed eight
mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's best-selling book
``Into Thin Air.'' Cameraman David Breashears fills the screen with
awesome vistas, but discreetly avoids the piles of discarded oxygen
tanks, human waste and frozen bodies that now litter the trails of
the mountain. This is a film whose cruel beauty manages to
celebrate the spirit of the climbers, while making you question
their sanity. (SM) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Godzilla PG-13
</P>
<P>
   He's back. He's big. He's boring. There was probably no way
Hollywood's extravagant update of ``Godzilla'' could live up to its
year-long hype. What's depressing is how far it falls short from
being even solid summer escapism. Bikini Atoll resident Godzilla
comes to nest in Manhattan when it's time to think of family
matters. Matthew Broderick is a biologist on the monster's trail.
Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action/violence. 2 hours, 19 minutes. (SM)
Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   The Governess R
</P>
<P>
   Where's Mary Poppins when you need her? In the 1840s, a young
Jewish woman (Minnie Driver) poses as a Christian in order to
secure a job with a wealthy family on a remote Scottish island and
help her own debt-stricken family. The film tries to deliver a
treatise on religious bigotry plus a dollop of feminism within the
context of a fevered bodice-ripper. What evolves is an over-busy
movie with under-realized potential. Rated R for sexual scenes and
nudity. 1 hour, 54 minutes. (ER) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Halloween: H20 R
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Lee Curtis returns in this unsurprising 20th anniversary
sequel to John Carpenter's 1978 frightfest ``Halloween.'' Now,
she's a single mom to 17-year-old John (Josh Hartnett). Also back
is Michael Myers, the maniac who stalked Curtis all those years
ago. You can easily guess who'll survive and who'll get cut out of
the picture, literally. But when Curtis pulls a Sigourney Weaver, a
la ``Aliens,'' stalking Michael instead of fleeing him, the movie
finally gets some juice. Rated R for profanity, violence, gore,
alcohol use. 1 hour, 22 minutes. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   How Stella Got Her Groove Back R
</P>
<P>
   The screen version of Terry McMillan's novel tries to distract
us from its lack of plot with visual opulence. Angela Bassett plays
a fortysomething investment banker who takes a trip to Jamaica with
her best pal (Whoopi Goldberg), where she falls for a 20-year-old
local (Taye Diggs). Luckily, Bassett roots the picture with a
glowing performance, sharing with us Stella's unexpected moments of
emotional rediscovery. Rated R for sexual situations, nudity,
language. 2 hours, 4 minutes. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Lethal Weapon 4 R
</P>
<P>
   The latest in director Richard Donner's cheerfully chaotic
blow-em-up series re-pairs Mel Gibson's hothead cop Riggs, and
Danny Glover's long-suffering partner Murtaugh. Shaggy and amiable,
Number 4 hardly bothers to get its real plot going for its first
hour. More than ever, the film is an excuse to give its crack
supporting cast, including Joe Pesci and Chris Rock, a series of
comic riffs. Rated R for violence and profanity. 2 hours, 5
minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Madeline PG
</P>
<P>
   A remarkably faithful and fun adaptation of the beloved series
of children's books about a precocious redheaded orphan living in a
girls school. Set in the relatively uncomplicated 1950s and
breathtakingly filmed in Paris, it's fast-paced enough to appeal to
kids (even little boys should take to the motor scooter-riding
rascal Pepito) and just nostalgic enough for adults. Rated PG for
comic violence. 1 hour, 29 minutes. (Jill Vejnoska) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The Mask of Zorro PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Derring-do done right. Our men in black are Anthony Hopkins and
Antonio Banderas who double our swashbuckling pleasure and double
our fun as dual Zorros, saving California and Hopkins' beautful,
spirited daughter (stunning newcomer, Catherine Zeta-Jones) from
the evil schemes of one Don Rafael (Stuart Wilson). It's an expert
blend of panache, romanticism and supple, tongue-in-cheek humor.
Rated PG-13 for violence. 2 hours, 16 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Mulan G
</P>
<P>
   The best Disney animated feature since ``Beauty and the Beast''
and ``The Lion King.'' Based on a 4th-century legend, it's about a
young girl who pulls a National Velvet, i.e., disguises herself as
a boy and goes to battle in her elderly father's place. This isn't
just a grand family film; it's a grand film, period. As Eddie
Murphy's little red dragon says, ``Mulan, you the man!'' 1 hour, 28
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   The Negotiator R
</P>
<P>
   In this crisply acted thriller, Samuel L. Jackson plays a
hostage negotiator for the Chicago police department who is framed
for embezzlement and murder. Desperate to clear his name, he takes
four members of the department hostage, then asks another
negotiator (Kevin Spacey) to act as a mediator between himself and
his fellow officers. The film's main kick is the engrossing duel of
bluffs and counterbluffs between Spacey and Jackson. They make us
believe in the high stakes of the situation. Rated R for violence
and profanity. 2 hours, 15 minutes. (SM) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The Opposite of Sex R
</P>
<P>
   Christina Ricci's teen tart burns across the screen in this
acerbic yet strangely sweet black comedy. The convoluted plot kicks
off when Ricci visits her gay half-brother (Martin Donovan) and
steals his dim-bulb lover (Ivan Sergei). The eclectic (and fine)
supporting cast includes Lisa Kudrow and Lyle Lovett. Rated R for
vulgar language, sexual situations, some nudity and sexual
references. 1 hour, 40 minutes. (ER)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Out of Sight R
</P>
<P>
   Another winning adaptation of a book by Elmore Leonard, the
brain that cooked up ``Get Shorty.'' George Clooney plays a courtly
bank robber, Jennifer Lopez is the federal marshal he kidnaps. In
outline, this is a screwball romantic comedy. It just happens to be
propelled by firepower, betrayal, bloodshed _ and the erotic
gravitational pull between the two leads. Rated R for language. 2
hours, 9 minutes. (SM) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   The Parent Trap PG
</P>
<P>
   Wisely deviates little from the plot of the 1961 Disney film
that made 15-year-old Hayley Mills a star. This time Lindsay Lohan
plays the dual role of separated-practically-at-birth identical
twins who meet and switch identities in the hopes of reuniting
their divorced parents. FAX machines and ``Leo'' DiCaprio
references dot this modernized tale. Young kids may fidget at the
length and several kissing scenes. Rated PG for mild profanity and
alcohol use. 2 hours, 7 minutes. (Jill Vejnoska) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Passion in the Desert PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A desert reverie about the bond between man and beast. In the
late 18th century, an officer in Napoleon's army gets separated
from the rest of the troop and wanders through the Egyptian desert
until he finds refuge in some ancient ruins. His sole companion? A
lithe, solitary, potentially man-eating leopard. A striking,
strangely lyrical, daringly original film about discovering your
inner cat-person. Rated PG-13 for violence and nudity. 1 hour, 33
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   (pi) R
</P>
<P>
   Warning to anyone whose math paranoia dates back to 8th-grade
algebra: Darren Aronovsky has your number(s). In his technically
and intellectually brilliant film, a solitary math prodigy (Sean
Gulette) stumbles onto a number that could be the key to everything
unknowable in the universe, be it the stock market or God. Named
best director at Sundance, Aronovsky is clearly a talent to be
watched; hopefully, next time, he'll wed his head-trip images to a
more involving script. Rated R for vulgar language and grotesque
violence. 1 hour, 25 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Regeneration NR
</P>
<P>
   A somber and articulate drama that examines the battle scars of
a more distant war _ World War I. In 1917, at a hospital for
shell-shocked British officers, a doctor (`'Evita's'' Jonathan
Pryce) begins to have doubts about his work. Among his patients are
the poet/war hero/pacifist Siegfried Sassoon (James Wilby) and
fledgling soldier-poet, Wilfred Owen (Stuart Bunce). If the movie
accomplishes less than it might, it's mostly because it sets out to
do so much. Not rated but includes nudity, strong language and
violence. 1 hour, 53 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Return to Paradise R
</P>
<P>
   Hardly paradise. Three guys party hard together in Malaysia. Two
(Vince Vaughn, David Conrad) return home and find out, two years
later from a lawyer (Anne Heche), that the third (Joaquin Phoenix)
has been jailed on drug charges since they left and will be hanged
in eight days unless they return to share the responsibility. But
that also means sharing the jail time. It's a terriifc,
what-would-you-do moral dilemma that's squandered by an inept
script. Rated R for language, drug references and a brief sex
scene. 1 hour, 49 minutes. (ER) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Saving Private Ryan R
</P>
<P>
   Part gung-ho heroism, part in-your-face horror show, Steven
Spielberg's superb film shows us World War II as we've never seen
it before. Tom Hanks leads a courageous squad (and excellent
ensemble cast) on a mission to find a private (Matt Damon) whose
three brothers have already been killed in combat. Hanks'
performance is a miracle of decency and subtle emotion, but kudos
all 'round here. And the opening D-Day sequence is the most
powerful combat footage ever created on film. Rated R for extreme
violence and some vulgar language. 2 hours, 50 minutes. (ER) Grade:
A
</P>
<P>
   Six Days, Seven Nights PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Think ``Romancing the Stone'' ... only without the romance or
the adventure. Harrison Ford is a gruff charter pilot and Anne
Heche is a New York magazine editor. They wind up stranded on an
island near Tahiti _ an abandoned place, except for some pirates.
The pair bicker, bond and kick some pirate butt. Rated PG-13 for
sexual entendres and implied sex. 1 hour, 41 minutes. (SM) Grade:
C+
</P>
<P>
   Smoke Signals PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A bittersweet coming-of-age comedy about two Native Americans
who leave their dilapidated reservation to go to Arizona to fetch
their father's (one biological; the other spiritual) ashes.
Rambling and rough around the edges, with a honed casualness that
suggests the early '70s, Chris Eyre's debut film is still
definitely worth a look. Rated PG-13 for vulgar language and
alcohol abuse. 1 hour, 30 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Snake Eyes R
</P>
<P>
   Oscar-winner Nicolas Cage and Brian De Palma are always worth
gambling on; while they don't come up total winners here, they're
hardly losers either. Cage plays a crooked Atlantic City cop who
finds himself in the middle of an assassination plot during a
heavyweight boxing match. Part detective story, part
action-thriller, the picture loses steam near the end, but De
Palma's wired camerawork and Cage's strutting energy help hold it
together. Rated R for violence and language. 1 hour, 42 minutes.
(ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   There's Something About Mary R
</P>
<P>
   Rude, crude and hilarious, this comedy by the ``Dumb &AMP; Dumber''
team of Peter and Bobby Farrelly definitely isn't a family film.
Ben Stiller plays Ted, a nerdy high school senior who suffers a
very particular bathroom mishap that keeps him from attending his
prom with the class golden girl (Cameron Diaz). Thirteen years
later, he hires a lower-rung gumshoe (Matt Dillon) to track her
down. The movie is liberating in its scatological, slapstick way.
But the easy-to-offend should find something more polite to watch.
Rated R for strong comic sexual content and language. 1 hour, 58
minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The Truman Show PG
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey's excellent performance is the centerpiece of this
provocative, thoroughly entertaining social satire about a cheerful
insurance salesman who slowly realizes his entire life has been a
TV show and everyone he knows are actors. Peter Weir directs this
dazzlingly executed conceit and the strong cast includes Laura
Linney and Ed Harris. Rated PG for mild language. 1 hour, 44
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Wrongfully Accused PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The sultan of spoof, Leslie Nielsen (``Airplane!'' ``The Naked
Gun'') stars in this gag-glutted comedy that skewers such movies as
``The Fugitive'' and ``Mission: Impossible.'' Co-starring Richard
Crenna and Kelly Le Brock. Not reviewed at press time. Grade: NR
</P>
<P>
   The X-Files PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Bigger but not really better. Though the feature film
continuation of Fox's conspiracy-mad TV series offers more gore and
profanity, it never accelerates to that stratospheric level of
action, suspense or awe that we hope for in a summer movie. As FBI
agents Mulder and Scully, David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson take
a smooth step up from television to the big screen. Rated PG-13 for
mild language, gore and violence. 2 hours, 2 minutes. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Your Friends &AMP; Neighbors R
</P>
<P>
   With friends (and neighbors) like these. ... Neil LaBute, who
did the lacerating ``In the Company of Men,'' suffers a sophomore
slump of sorts in this black comedy about sex games and power plays
among six thirtysomething urbanites, some paired off, some not. The
movie is smart, funny and cynical, but never as smart, funny and
cynical as it thinks it is. The result is less like first-rate Neil
LaBute than second-rung Woody Allen. Rated R for sex and language.
1 hour, 45 minutes. (ER) Grade: C+

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The drought of '98 has cost state farms and
ranches $2.1 billion, making it the worst weather disaster for
Texas agriculture since the infamous drought of the 1950s,
agricultural economists say. The new crop loss estimate tops the
$2.09 billion lost in the 1996 drought. By WORTH WREN JR. Story has

   UNDATED _ Last month, when Ray Liotta turned up to promote ``The
Rat Pack,'' he was clearly irritated by the constant assertions
that he didn't look a thing like Frank Sinatra, even in a dimly lit
room. No matter, it turns out. ``The Rat Pack,'' the story of the
glorious and glamorous alliance of Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy
Davis Jr., isn't about imitation as much as imagination. There's so
much stuffed into this HBO film, airing at 8 p.m. Sunday, that you

GROUP SAYS BILL TO CURB DOCTOR-ASSISTED SUICIDE HURTS PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bill aimed at curbing physician-assisted suicide
by trying to limit the amount of pain medication a doctor can
prescribe would leave more chronically ill people in pain and
possibly cause more suicides, several medical care groups said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the groups _ including the American College of
Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine, the American
Pharmaceutical Association and the National Hospice Organization _
said at a news conference that the bill could scare doctors away
from prescribing adequate pain medication.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would require the government to revoke physicians'
licenses if the Drug Enforcement Agency finds that they have
``intentionally dispensed or distributed a (drug) with a purpose of
causing, or assisting in causing, the suicide or euthanasia of any
individual.'' A federal board would hold hearings at which doctors
would have to defend their anti-pain prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The House is expected to vote on the bill next month. A similar
measure in the Senate is pending in the Judiciary Committee and may
go to a vote before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crux of good medical care is between a patient, the
doctor, and the family,'' said Robert Copeland, a physician in
LaGrange, Ga. But he warned that ``adding a gumshoe,'' or making
doctors answer to federal investigators, would complicate the task
of providing a patient with adequate medication.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland, who chairs the Philadelphia-based American College of
Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine, praised the goal
of preventing physician-assisted suicide. But he said the bill
would make doctors fearful of damaging their reputation and of
being penalized for prescribing large doses of pain medication,
which he said are often necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland said doctors sometimes need to prescribe more than 10
times the Food and Drug Administration-recommended dosage for
medications to adequately relieve severe pain.
</P>
<P>
   Samira Beckwith, director of Hope Hospice and Palliative Care in
Ft. Myers, Fla., said the bill would have the opposite effect of
what legislators expect. Prescriptions for pain medication would
decrease and suffering would increase, and as a result, more
elderly people in chronic pain would seek assisted suicide, she
warned.
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith recalled a 50-year-old man with terminal cancer who
``asked our staff and ... many people in the community about how he
could commit suicide.'' She said the man wanted to call Michigan to
search for Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the leading advocate of
physician-assisted suicide, when her staff began giving him
medication.
</P>
<P>
   Four days after his treatment started, he was up and talking
with his family, she said, and later died peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Bennett, president of the American Society of Pain
Management Nurses, a Pensacola, Fla.,-based group, said there are
no ``normal doses'' of medication for seriously ill patients.
</P>
<P>
   One 15-year-old cancer patient, Bennett said, received 4,600
micrograms of a pain medication, Fentanyl, every hour, which is 46
times the FDA-recommended maximum dose.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was awake, alert, talking to her parents and joking with
her nurses,'' Bennett said. ``This dosage was needed to control her
pain at that point in her disease. ... She died pain-free in the
arms of her parents as a result of her cancer, not because of her
medication.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said such a large dose would catch the attention of the
special board proposed in the bill, and a physician might not be
willing to give that amount for fear of federal reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   Pain care is already inadequate, Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study in the Journal of the American Medical
Association, 26 percent of elderly patients with daily pain who
live in nursing homes receive no medication for pain.
</P>
<P>
   Only Oregon has a law that allows physicians to prescribe a
deadly dose of drugs to terminally ill patients, or people with a
life expectancy of six months or less. The doctors may not
administer the medicine, but the patients may. Forty-six states and
Washington, D.C. have state statutes or laws prohibiting
physician-assisted suicide. North Carolina, Utah and Wyoming do not
have laws on doctor-assisted suicides.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Skip Baker, president of the American Society for Action on
Pain, a Williamsburg, Va.-based patient advocacy group, said he
takes 500 milligrams of morphine a day, as prescribed by his doctor
for his debilitating joint disease that causes him chronic pain.
</P>
<P>
   For 14 months he could not get enough medication and suffered
great weight loss because he often was in too much pain to eat, he
said. Now his doctor gives him adequate pain relief, but he said he
fears that the proposed legislation would put him back in
unmanageable pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this bill passes, at some point down the road, it is going
to cause my suicide,'' he said.

TOWN HONORS SOLDIER KILLED IN BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW SCHOFIELD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   (LAMAR, Mo. )_ No town seems less likely
to feel the effects of a terrorist bomb than this one, where flags
hang from every pole on the square and a Statue of Liberty replica
sits on a corner.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yet on Wednesday, an Army honor guard in pressed green uniforms
and bright white gloves draped an American flag over the polished
wood coffin of Staff Sgt. Kenneth Hobson II. Hobson was killed by a
terrorist bomb Aug. 7 at his post in the American embassy in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   And on this sweltering afternoon, hundreds of the slain
soldier's family, friends, soldiers and other well-wishers streamed
into the town's Thiebaud Auditorium to say goodbye to a man they
referred to as a hero, a good father and a brave soldier.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among those saying goodbye was his young widow,
Deborah, who accepted two meritorious conduct medals and a purple
heart for her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Then, she handed their infant daughter, Meghan, to a relative
and walked with tight steps onto the stage. Surrounded by dozens of
floral arrangements, she stood near her 27-year-old husband's
coffin. Before reading a farewell poem, she said: ``He's still in
my heart. I just can't bring myself to say goodbye yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Then with her voice breaking, and her words chopped to stifle
sobs, she read from the poem, ``Live your life to its fullest, and
when you need me, just whisper my name.'' She ended by turning and
hurrying off the stage and back to her family.
</P>
<P>
   During the ceremony, relatives took turns carrying Meghan, 2, up
and down the aisle. She alternately called out, ``Ma-ma'' and
``Da-da'' and held tight a single yellow flower.
</P>
<P>
   Army Major General Robert Flowers paid a soldier's tribute to
Hobson, saying, ``If, God forbid, my four sons ever have to go to
war, I would want them serving with or under a soldier like Staff
Sgt. Kenneth Hobson II.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Congressman Roy Blunt spoke of the cowardly act that had
killed Hobson.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no greater love than to lay down your life for
another,'' he said. ``And that's what Sgt. Hobson did. And he did
it for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hobson was remembered through the day as an artist and a student
who loved a good debate. He graduated in 1989 from high school and
joined the Army. He served through the Gulf War, clearing out enemy
bunkers in the Iraqi desert. He married in 1994 and had a daughter
two years ago. He trained to be a linguist and five months ago
transferred to the American Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I was in Vietnam with his father, and his father was
my hero,'' Ronald Meyer, who came from Wisconsin for the funeral,
said softly.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, Kenneth Hobson II's father saved Meyer's life
in Vietnam, fighting off the enemy after a bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``There we were, in wartime and surrounded by the threat of
death, and we survived,'' Meyers said. ``It doesn't seem fair that
his son should die now, 30 years later during peacetime. It just
doesn't seem fair.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York
City. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   ``ARMAGEDDON,'' starring Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck and Liv
Tyler. Directed by Michael Bay (PG-13, 144 minutes). This big,
showy, spirit-crushing summer extravaganza includes not a single
heartfelt moment, unless you count its sequence set in a strip
club. Imminent doom (courtesy of an approaching asteroid) becomes
the excuse for rampant flag-waving, gung-ho patriotism and a notion
of heroism that has nothing whatever to do with real courage.
Willis gets the film's noblest lines for the same reason that he
probably got the set's biggest trailer. Affleck tries gamely to
seem mad about Ms. Tyler, who serves as window dressing at NASA
headquarters. Totally predictable elements _ loud noises, frequent
explosions and bright computer screen colors _ seem as inevitable
and deadly as the asteroid while they create the illusion of
escapist fun (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE AVENGERS,'' starring Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes.
Directed by Jeremiah Chechik (PG, 100 minutes). Sometimes major
movie studios should be afraid to screen expensive fiascos for the
press, but they go ahead anyway. ``The Avengers'' is Warner
Brothers' would-be blockbuster that actually had its light hidden
beneath a bushel until opening day, and no wonder. With
pseudo-suave repartee that would make Austin Powers blush and with
so many shades of ``Howard the Duck'' that one scene depicts
man-size pastel teddy bears sitting around a conference table, it's
a film to gall fans of the old television series and perplex anyone
else. I can't remember another Friday morning show where I heard
actual cries of ``Ugh!'' on the way out the door (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE CHAMBERMAID ON THE TITANIC,'' starring Olivier Martinez,
Aitana Sanchez Gijon and Romane Bohringer. Directed by Bigas Luna
(not rated; 96 minutes). A delightful, sexy period fable, adapted
from a novel by Didier Decoin. ``Chambermaid'' wittily illustrates
the basic human need to consume and spin heroic stories of passion
and loss (whether or not they're true). When Horty ( Martinez), a
poor French foundry worker, wins a contest that sends him to
Southhampton, England, to watch the Titanic depart on its maiden
voyage, he takes to his hotel room a woman who claims to be a
chambermaid on the ship and has no lodging. After the ship sinks,
his co-workers press him about the details, and his fabricated
story of an ultimate one-night stand becomes a local myth that
eventually catapults him into a show business career telling the
same (increasingly embellished) tale over and over. The movie has
profound things to say about gossip, storytelling and the primal
urge to mythicize personal experience (Stephen Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``EVER AFTER: A CINDERELLA STORY,'' starring Drew Barrymore,
Anjelica Huston and Dougray Scott. Directed by Andy Tennant (PG-13,
120 minutes). The clever notion of reinventing Cinderella as a
self-motivated powerhouse who doesn't need a fairy godmother to get
ahead has been reduced into a bland mishmash of comedy and soap
opera. Drew Barrymore is appealing as Danielle, a plucky,
resourceful, slightly tomboyish 16th-century French girl who knows
how to stand up for herself. But her wimpish prince ( Scott) isn't
much of a prize to crow over. And why is Leonardo da Vinci (Patrick
Godfrey) traipsing around France with the ``Mona Lisa'' under his
arm, giving advice to the lovelorn? The most orthodox refugee from
the standard fairy tale is Ms. Huston's haughty stepmother
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``EVEREST,'' directed by David Brashears with Greg MacGillivray
(not rated; 45 minutes). If life in New York City doesn't provide
enough in the way of thrills, those in search of a vicarious
near-death experience can make their way to the Sony Imax Theater
at Lincoln Square (1998 Broadway, at 68th Street) for a go at
``Everest.'' There, images of the world's highest mountain _ 29,028
feet _ find a frame worthy of the peak's spectacular, lethal
beauty: the eight-story-high, 100-foot-wide screen. This account
focuses mainly on the efforts of three people to scale the peak in
1996 despite yawning chasms of ever-shifting ice and sudden,
blinding storms. While this expedition was on the mountain, other
teams made their way into the so-called death zone, at 25,000 feet,
where a violent storm overtook them. Eight people perished in the
worst single disaster on the mountain. ``Everest'' makes it
possible for armchair adventurers to share the risks and glory of
the team's climb toward heaven (Lawrence Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE GOVERNESS,'' starring Minnie Driver and Tom Wilkinson.
Directed by Sandra Goldbacher (R, 114 minutes). It is the early
1840s, and Rosina (Minnie Driver), a headstrong young Sephardic
Jewish woman living in London, poses as a gentile to get a job as a
governess for the Cavendish family on a remote Scottish island.
Falling in love with the skittish, devoutly Christian head of the
household (Tom Wilkinson), a gentleman inventor with whom she has a
stormy affair, she becomes his collaborator in the invention of
photography. The ravishingly handsome film works on several levels:
as a proto-feminist fable, a meditation on still photography and
its relation to real life, and a portrait of lovers whose religious
difference becomes an unbridgeable emotional gap. Ms. Driver holds
the picture with a solid performance that falls short of great
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK,'' starring Angela Bassett,
Taye Diggs and Whoopi Goldberg. Directed by Kevin Rodney Sullivan.
(R, 99 minutes). This silly soft-core fantasy in which 40-year-old
Stella (Ms. Bassett) meets and falls in love with 20-year-old
Winston ( Diggs) while on vacation in Jamaica is part Caribbean
travel brochure (fly to Jamaica and meet the hunk of your dreams)
and part diluted Chippendales strip show floated on a bathtub full
of suds with some light comedy thrown in. Ms. Bassett brings real
fire to the role of a beautiful divorced-with-one-son San Francisco
stockbroker whose resistance to romance is broken down in the
tropics. But Diggs' nearly perfect boyfriend is a vapid
romance-novel fabrication. Ms. Goldberg shamelessly stirs up the
suds as Stella's raunchy best friend, who is secretly dying of
liver cancer (Holden).

ASKED TO RESIGN? DO IT! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   Mike Barnicle's employer asked him to
resign. Barnicle refused. Barnicle kept his job _ for awhile,
anyway.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Should you use Barnicle's tactic if you get a similar demand?
Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   If your work relationship is so tainted that your boss wants you
gone, it's probably best for everyone that you go. On Wednesday,
Barnicle finally admitted the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody asked me for my resignation, I would probably give
it,'' said Nancy Day, a human resources professor at the University
of Missouri-Kansas City. ``If their need for me has ended, it
wouldn't be a great place for me to fulfill my career objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle, a columnist at /{The Boston Globe/}, was asked to
resign after jokes from a George Carlin book appeared in his column
without credit to Carlin. Barnicle said a friend gave him the jokes
and he hadn't read the book. But, others noted, Barnicle had
recommended the book on a TV show.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it was _ plagiarism or lying _ it led editors to seek
Barnicle's resignation. But advertisers and readers were Barnicle
boosters. Editors reconsidered. He got a two-month, unpaid
suspension. Then another problem column was revealed, and Barnicle
resigned, agreeing it was best for all.
</P>
<P>
   If a client walked into Robert L. Dameron's law offices in
Kansas City, Kan., and said, ``I've been asked to resign. Should I
say no?'' Dameron, a labor law specialist, said he'd ask at least
three questions:
</P>
<P>
   Do you have a good chance of getting another job quickly?
</P>
<P>
   Are you being fired ``for cause'' _ because of misconduct or
lack of performance according to your employer's reasonable
expectations?
</P>
<P>
   Is your employer willing to give you a good reference letter in
exchange for your resignation?
</P>
<P>
   Missouri, Kansas and many other states have ``at will'' labor
laws. That means a job relationship can be ended for any reason or
for no reason, absent an individual employment contract or
collective bargaining agreement. There are other exceptions, too,
if the worker is protected by federal or state statutes or public
policy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you believed you were asked to resign because
you were _ pick one _ disabled, involved in a worker's compensation
claim, or the victim of race, sex or age discrimination, you might
refuse to resign and seek job protection under the relevant laws.
</P>
<P>
   If none of those protections applies, though, you probably have
this choice: Do I resign or get fired?
</P>
<P>
   If you don't expect to find another job quickly, you might note
that _ usually _ resigning from a job will cause a greater delay in
getting unemployment benefits than getting fired. But if you were
fired ``for cause'' you may get no unemployment benefits anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It's wisest to dwell on Dameron's third question: Can you get a
good reference letter?
</P>
<P>
   Missouri (but not Kansas) law, grants you the right to obtain a
service letter that lists your dates of employment. In any state,
though, it's much easier to get a new job with fuller, nicer
letters of recommendation. It's also easier to explain a
resignation ``because of opinion differences'' than to explain a
firing.
</P>
<P>
   A final tip: If you negotiate a reference letter, it's safer to
have it in hand /{before/} you sign your resignation papers.

 UNDATED: cancer (Holden). 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO,'' starring Kate Beckinsale and Chloe
Sevigny. Directed by Whit Stillman (R, 112 minutes). Stillman's
smart, fretful, patrician characters turn up midway between
``Metropolitan'' and ``Barcelona'' in a film that charmingly mixes
postcollege career worries with improbable discomania. A delightful
cast engages in nonstop flirtation and hair-splitting debate,
rendered with Stillman's usual acuity and humor. Ms. Beckinsale, an
English actress with a flawless American accent here and diffidence
that's just as perfect, holds court beguilingly at the center of a
bright and amusing crowd. The ideal film for anyone willing to
entertain the notion that the spread of environmentalism was
sparked by the revival of ``Bambi'' during the disco generation's
formative years (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``LETHAL WEAPON 4,'' starring Mel Gibson, Danny Glover and Rene
Russo. Directed by Richard Donner (R, 125 minutes). In the full
perspective-warping heat of the summer movie season, this turns out
to be one of the nicer blow-'em-ups around. The characters are
funny and likable, and they all live on earth. The formula still
has some zip. The stars, with the welcome new addition of Chris
Rock as a young detective who has literally married into the
``Lethal Weapon'' family, play their roles with breezy finesse. And
the story, about slave smuggling and Chinese gangsters, is a
flamboyant, fight-filled adventure fueled by kidding camaraderie
and constant forward motion. Bear in mind that this is still a film
whose idea of high drama is watching a car getting pushed in front
of an oncoming train (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``MAFIA!,'' starring Jay Mohr, Lloyd Bridges and Christina
Applegate. Directed by Jim Abrahams (PG-13, 86 minutes). This
sendup makes an offer you could probably refuse, but its
Mad-magazine-style hit-or-miss humor works well enough to be
reasonably bright. It's true, though, that a Mafia movie satire
without a single horse's head in a bed and without anyone who
sounds like Joe Pesci has left a few stones unturned. Concentrating
mostly on the ``Godfather'' films and ``Casino,'' Abrahams throws
in anything from canned meatballs by Spalding to vomit gags. Lloyd
Bridges, to whose memory the film is dedicated, has the role of a
dapper don and shows one last time how sporting and debonair he
could be (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE MASK OF ZORRO,'' starring Antonio Banderas, Anthony
Hopkins and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Directed by Martin Campbell
(PG-13, 130 minutes). Travel back to the days when swashbuckling
was serious business, when boyish adventure films still had their
innocence and when the bravado of thrilling stunt work was all a
movie needed in the way of special effects. Hopkins is marvelously
game as the film's dashing senior Zorro. Banderas was born to play
the aging hero's jokey, hotblooded protege. And he meets his match
in the story's heroine, whose beauty is inevitably described as
``beyond compare.'' This robust old-fashioned adventure should
appeal to older children, but beware of a few needlessly grisly
touches (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE NEGOTIATOR,'' starring Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey.
Directed by F. Gary Gray (R, 115 minutes). In a twist on the
Hitchcockian maxim, this thriller takes two extraordinary actors
and places them in surprisingly ordinary circumstances. In a film
whose title should have been plural, both stars play seasoned
hostage negotiators who are caught up in a by-the-numbers battle of
wits. Amazingly, both these shrewd, maverick actors are cast as
nice guys, team players and clean-cut family men. The movie's
brisk, familiar look of a police story, heavy with close-ups, that
escalates to a paramilitary operation will look right at home when
it comes to the video screen (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``NIGHTS OF CABIRIA,'' starring Giulietta Masina. Directed by
Federico Fellini (not rated, 117 minutes). Anyone dismayed by the
hyperkinetic emptiness of summertime film spectacles will find the
antidote in this 1957 Fellini masterpiece. It has been refurbished
and revived by the same team that brought back ``Contempt'' last
year, and they display the same acumen in reissuing a film of
special prescience; though it was shot in black and white amid the
poverty of postwar Italy, neither the style nor the searching of
``Cabiria' has grown dated at all. In a heartbreaking performance,
the star plays a scrappy Roman streetwalker who drifts almost
magically among the film's astonishingly varied realms. There is
more grace and courage in the famous image of Masina smiling
through her tears than in all the fire-breathing blockbusters
Hollywood has to offer (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE OPPOSITE OF SEX,'' starring Christina Ricci, Martin
Donovan, Lisa Kudrow and Lyle Lovett. Directed by Don Roos (R, 100
minutes). Wicked, foulmouthed and very funny, this gleefully
acerbic comedy finds that Ms. Ricci has morphed enchantingly from
nasty little Wednesday of ``The Addams Family'' into Lolita's evil
twin. Voluptuous and scheming, her poisonous Dedee narrates this
film and announces immediately that she won't be developing a heart
of gold. Which is, of course, mostly a lie. The film brutally
skewers preconceptions about gay and straight life, then lets its
characters intermingle in sweetly unexpected ways. Donovan and Ms.
Kudrow, as unlikely comrades brought together by Dedee's treachery,
deliver the zingers from Roos' screenplay with deadpan panache
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE PARENT TRAP,'' starring Lindsay Lohan, Natasha Richardson
and Dennis Quaid. Directed by Nancy Meyers and written by David
Swift, Ms. Meyers and Charles Shyer (PG, 128 minutes). A super-cute
remake of the old Hayley Mills hit, this time given a privileged
shelter-magazine gloss by the ``Father of the Bride'' team of Ms.
Meyers and Shyer. Ms. Richardson and Quaid beam appealingly as
parents who somehow managed to separate their twins at birth
without a twinge of guilt and who seem to have spent all of the
intervening 11 1/2 years shopping. In her dual role as English and
American sisters (one lives in a grand London town house, the other
on a big Napa Valley vineyard; nobody lives in a coal mine), the
spirited Ms. Lohan commandeers the movie as if she had been taking
shrinking-violet lessons from Sharon Stone (Maslin).

 UNDATED: Stone (Maslin). 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``SAVING PRIVATE RYAN,'' starring Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Tom
Sizemore, Jeremy Davies and Edward Burns. Directed by Steven
Spielberg (R, 168 minutes). Spielberg's soberly magnificent new
film is the finest war movie of our time. Turning back the clock to
restore passion and meaning to the genre, he works in a spirit of
urgent communication to look at war as if it had not been looked at
before. Tour-de-force battle scenes are frank without
sensationalism, and the same great storyteller who made you believe
there was an extraterrestrial hiding in the closet has made this an
irresistibly vibrant, gripping tale. Hanks continues to astonish
with admirable modesty, and the rest of the casting is comparably
inspired. As he did with ``Schindler's List,'' Spielberg has made a
landmark film of devastating power (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``SMALL SOLDIERS,'' starring Gregory Smith and Phil Hartman.
Directed by Joe Dante (PG-13, 105 minutes). This ably animated film
about action-figure toys who virtually come to life should have
been a sure thing. There are innocent echoes of ``Toy Story'' and
darker ones of the director's own ``Gremlins'' pictures, which had
the witty balance of mischief and horror that ``Small Soldiers''
strangely lacks. The voice talent here is extraordinary, with the
casts of ``The Dirty Dozen'' and ``This Is Spinal Tap'' playing
rival toy factions, and Tommy Lee Jones and Frank Langella as their
respective commanders. But the story remains unfocused and grows
too wan for horror, too creepy for lighthearted fun. Another reason
not to laugh is Hartman's performance in the fatuous role that was
his last (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``SNAKE EYES,'' starring Nicolas Cage and Gary Sinise. Directed
by Brian De Palma (R, 99 minutes). An assassination, a fixed
heavyweight boxing bout and a perfectly timed hurricane named
Jezebel collide apocalyptically one night in Atlantic City, where
hellfire rains over a hotel and casino appropriately called the
Millennium. Here is where Rick Santoro (Cage), the sleazy police
detective in charge of security, discovers that his best friend (
Sinise) could also be his nemesis and he has to make hard moral
choices. This entertaining pop fable, which recalls the director's
``Blow Out,'' isn't believable for a second, but it has a pulpy
energy that keeps on chugging (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE SPANISH PRISONER,'' starring Campbell Scott, Rebecca
Pidgeon, Ben Gazzara and Steve Martin. Directed by David Mamet (PG,
112 minutes). The most engaging of Mamet's cinematic puzzles begins
with an X-ray at an airport security check. And the audience will
wish it had a similar device for reading the characters' sneaky
minds. No such luck: the mystery here, in a handsome and
Hitchcockian film named for an elaborate con game, stays tricky to
the very end. Scott plays the inventor of a lucrative, stealable
scientific process, with Gazzara as the boss who's in no hurry to
compensate him for it. In an ensemble cast working entirely on the
calculating Mamet wavelength, Martin plays a rich, debonair mystery
man who tells the inventor all about his pretty young sister. In
her performance as a pert, unaccountably off-kilter secretary, Ms.
Pidgeon perfectly embodies the film's sleight of hand (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY,'' starring Cameron Diaz, Ben
Stiller and Matt Dillon. Directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly (R,
119 minutes). Sometimes Western civilization declines in
deliriously funny style. Hence this proudly obnoxious comedy is a
hoot in every sense, deserving a smidgen of disapproval and a whole
lot of helpless laughter. Set in motion by a prom, a crush and a
cruel, cruel zipper, this paean to low humor works ridiculously
well because it never stoops to being mean-spirited or (despite all
appearances) authentically inane. The principal cast is bright and
appealing, with Ms. Diaz at her most beautiful and blithe. Do note
that this film strives hard for something to offend everyone, and
that a tolerance for zit jokes is unfortunately required (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``TITANIC,'' starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet and Gloria
Stuart. Directed by James Cameron (PG-13, 197 minutes). For once, a
much-touted event movie is exactly that: a glorious throwback to
the days when epic storytelling really filled the screen. Despite
the astonishing technological advances behind Cameron's great
visual spectacle, gimmicks are never allowed to intrude on the
film's central illusion, that the audience is drawn back into the
Gilded Age and intimately involved in the fateful voyage. For all
its painstaking historical detail, this ``Titanic'' proves anything
but quaint, thanks to the phenomenal immediacy of its sights and
the pure Hollywood hokum of its story. As two young lovers whose
romance is skillfully interwoven with historical detail, Ms.
Winslet and DiCaprio are a duo with serious chemistry. With his
``Gone With the Wind''-caliber ambitions, Cameron dared to dream of
the impossible and came up with the movie of the year (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE TRUMAN SHOW,'' starring Jim Carrey, Laura Linney and Ed
Harris. Directed by Peter Weir (PG, 104 minutes). The ultimate in
high-concept ingenuity. Hosannas and cartwheels for this ingenious
media-age fantasy are over the top, but by comparison with
Hollywood's usual notion of summer movie fare, it's definitely a
dazzler. Carrey, refreshingly free of shtick, gives an instantly
iconic performance as a guinea pig for an entertainment-happy
nation, a man whose whole life is a fraud contrived by Harris'
so-called ``televisionary.'' Carrey's innate edge of volatility
gives the material, from a screenplay of transfixing sci-fi
intensity, its trace of danger. Ms. Linney, as the actress playing
a wife whose bluff could be called at any moment, is the story's
spookiest character as well as its perkiest. Weir unifies the
story's many nuances with great finesse (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``WESTERN,'' starring Sergi Lopez and Sacha Bourdo. Directed by
Manuel Poirier (not rated, 121 minutes). What a tenderhearted
delight is ``Western,'' the best-kept secret in town. Don't be put
off by that misleading title: Poirier's road movie is actually set
in western France, where two funny and hapless outsiders wind up
joining forces and embarking on a wonderfully droll journey. The
story begins when a salesman from Spain is outsmarted by a wily
little Russian hitchhiker. It's an introduction that hardly has the
makings of a beautiful friendship. But that's exactly what develops
in a funny, romantic film filled with cozy intimacies and lovely,
wide-screen images of the French countryside. Looking for love,
these two lonely travelers find it in the most sweetly
unpredictable ways. Audiences are liable to fall in love, too
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE X-FILES,'' starring David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson.
Directed by Rob Bowman (PG-13, 115 minutes). Conspiracy theorists,
consider this: What if the hush-hush atmosphere and Internet mania
surrounding the first ``X-Files'' feature film were part of a giant
scheme to hide the uneventfulness of a summertime sci-fi fizzle?
It's as possible as much of what this spinoff film has to offer. If
devotees of the television series approach the film with enough
baggage for a six-week safari, maybe they can deepen the experience
of watching a middling action-adventure with brand-name appeal. But
this film will strike true X-fanatics as watered down, and remains
fairly bewildering to the uninitiated. And, no, Scully and Mulder
don't quite take their working relationship to a higher plane
(Maslin).

FRANKIE RUIZ WAS SALSA'S SHOOTING STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISA VALDES-RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I guess it's no surprise to me that salsa singer Frankie Ruiz
died last week at the age of 40, of liver cirrhosis. Anyone who
followed Ruiz's career _ his stints in jail, his fistfights with
flight attendants, his record company's publicity campaign about
his supposed drug and alcohol rehabilitation _ could have seen it
coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew this was going to happen,'' said Carrie Sanchez, who
had been Mr. Ruiz's booking agent for the past eight years, in a
phone interview from her New York office this week. ``He'd been
sick on and off for a year and eight months.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm remembering the one time I ended up backstage at a concert
of Mr. Ruiz's, at Vincent's nightclub in Randolph in 1995. I'd been
left breathless by his performance, and yet there he was,
staggering and reeking of alcohol after the show. He rolled his
sleeve up and excused himself _ and a syringe _ to the bathroom for
10 minutes before the interview could happen. He reappeared, moist
and clammy, and kept repeating himself. He looked like a little
boy: guilty and innocent all at once, trying to act professional,
unable to, pulled down by the layers of gold jewelry he wore around
his neck as surely as if they were made of lead. He was thinner
than he was in pictures I'd seen before. Most of all, I am
remembering the sad, faraway, decidedly drugged look in his eyes,
and my thoughts at the time: He can't go on like this. No one
could.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Ruiz was a rare talent. His voice may not have been the
strongest or most versatile in salsa, but it was passionate, part
of the reason it became the cornerstone of the salsa romantica
movement of the 1980s. His was a harsh tenor in some ways younger
than its owner, a voice almost adolescent in the sharp ways it
pulled unexpected notes out of scales and then hung them out where
we could see. When he performed, he meant it. No mild walking about
the stage for Mr. Ruiz. Rather, he bent into his notes, strained
for them, and the music became a person he danced with up there. It
was dazzling to watch, and heartbreaking to hear. The lyrics were
love poems. And yet, even then he was dying, before our eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Born Jose Antonio Terresola Ruiz in Patterson, N.J., on March
10, 1958, Mr. Ruiz began singing professionally, with the stage
name of Frankie Ruiz, as an adolescent, in  &UR; gfspanish &LR; Mayaguez,
Puerto Rico, where he had moved at the age of 7. At 15, his mother
took him to the Maricao nightclub, and proceeded to beg Roberto
Rivera, the leader of a band called La Solucion, to let her son
sing a tune or two.
</P>
<P>
   What Rivera did not expect was that the young Mr. Ruiz would
floor him. Soon after that night, the band had a new teenage singer
named Frankie. A couple of years later, he left the group to join
the Tommy Olivencia orchestra. Mr. Ruiz performed with the group
until 1980, when as a 22-year-old he decided to pursue a solo
career.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to release seven solo records, including the three
most recent ones: ``Mi Historia'' (1997), ``En Vivo'' (1996), and
``Tranquilo'' (1996). He had numerous hit songs, including ``La
Rueda,'' ``La Cura,'' ``Desnudate Mujer,'' and ``Mi Libertad.'' As
are most salsa singers, he was known for a sung signature phrase;
in Mr. Ruiz's case, it was ``Vaya, mi China!'' (roughly, ``Go,
baby!''). Even as the tawdry dramas of his personal life unfolded
in the Spanish tabloids, Mr. Ruiz was embraced by his fans.
</P>
<P>
   He was awarded many prizes in Latin America over the years, and
just last year won his first mainstream trophy in the United
States, in Billboard's Latin Music Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to Billboard magazine recently, Ralph Mercado,
president of RMM Records, for whichMr. Ruiz once recorded,
summarized the singer's tragedy: ``He had a brilliant career, but
he never took time to try and get cured.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Ruiz did not want to die in that room at University Hospital
in Newark, N.J., on Aug. 9, 1998, at 11:40 p.m., and he had said as
much. His father, girlfriend, ex-wife, and cousins were there,
watching helplessly. He'd been hospitalized before, and always he
managed to pull through. In fact, he had told friends he wanted God
to cure him this time, so that he could finish the album he had
been working on, a tribute to his favorite salsa singer of all
time, Hector Lavoe. According to the The Record (Bergen County,
N.J.), Mr. Ruiz told his father on his deathbed, ``When I die, play
my music.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Ruiz was buried in Fairlawn, N.J., near his most recent home
town of Union City. Memorial services have been held for him at the
Ortiz funeral home in the Bronx, and at City Hall in Mayaguez,
where the mayor called for three days of mourning for the town's
most famous musician. Mr. Ruiz leaves his father, Frank Terresola,
and three children: Cristina, Yaritza, and Frankie Jr. Hundreds of
Internet postings in makeshift mourning sites testify to the
singer's loyal following worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Ruiz's record company, Rodven/Polygram Latino, plans to
release the songs he had been working on at the time of his death,
in a disc called, appropriately, ``Nacimientos Y Recuerdos (Births
and Memories).''

   NEW YORK _ Sure, the waters of Baja are beautiful. So are those
of Alaska, the Pacific Northwest and dozens of other world-renowned
paddling destinations attracting thousands of avid kayakers each
year. But the waters of Manhattan, with its lights and contrasts,
might be the most beautiful of all.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, they were paddled by just a few, those who would
brave the dirt and the chemicals. Even finding a place to launch a
boat was almost impossible. In the last few years, though, the
water quality has improved. Now, almost anyone can get out on the
water, and kayaking has blossomed.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I completed a dream I'd had for several years: a
nighttime, solo circumnavigation of Manhattan. The last two summers
I've led kayak tours on most Saturday mornings from the Downtown
Boathouse in Tribeca to the Statue of Liberty and back. So I'd had
a little experience in Lower Manhattan waters. I'd even been on two
daylight round-Manhattan trips and remembered a bit of the route
and its problems.
</P>
<P>
   But a night journey promised to be something special. New York
aglow, seen from a kayak, could be an exhilarating experience.
</P>
<P>
   Shackled to the moon, the three rivers of Manhattan have lives
of their own. Two, the Harlem and the East, aren't rivers at all
but channels that suck and push water to and from the Hudson and
Long Island Sound. The only river worthy of its name is the Hudson,
and that, too, changes direction every six and a half hours.
</P>
<P>
   The East River has treacherous tidal currents nearly impossible
to paddle if you choose to fight them. The Harlem, too, can push a
boat backward or forward, depending on the time of day.
</P>
<P>
   The trick with all three is to read the tidal charts correctly,
as tides change with the position of the moon, ignoring clocks and
timetables. You must catch the tide at the Battery at just the
right moment so that the East River's rising waters, sweeping into
Long Island Sound, will pull you northward to the Harlem and later
to the Hudson, whose changing tide drags you southward. Miss that
window and you face near-constant paddling.
</P>
<P>
   As I left the Downtown Boathouse at 5:30 p.m. on a recent
Friday, the main current of the Hudson began carrying me south
toward the Battery. I only had to use the paddle to keep the bow of
my 15-foot kayak pointed southward; the river did the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Once I rounded Battery Point, I came upon a Staten Island ferry
berthed at her dock, boarding her rush-hour passengers. I could
hear the low thrum of her idling engines, the squeak of pilings
rustling in the waves, the throb of police boats. This was becoming
a very noisy trip.
</P>
<P>
   Turning toward the East River, I found the currents were against
me and began paddling as fast as I could to get around the ferry
before she backed out of the dock. There's a lot of that in
negotiating Manhattan by kayak: spurts of fast paddling.
</P>
<P>
   But quiet times usually come right afterward, offering moments
to laze in the eddies and the still waters between piers. South
Street provides a lot of those eddies, with piers for helicopters,
clipper ships and even tennis.
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot of time to dawdle, since the tide wouldn't turn
for another hour or two, so I wandered in and out and underneath
the piers, concentrating on the sounds of the shoreline at
twilight.
</P>
<P>
   New York sounds so different on the water. Because the shoreline
is protected by seawalls that rise several feet or more above you,
much of the sound gets channeled overhead. So even during the
evening rush hour, one can be cloistered in near silence while
several feet from heavy traffic. Then the quiet is broken by an
arriving helicopter, a passing jet skier or, at one pier, by a
bagpiper practicing a Gaelic-tinged ``America, the Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Paddling diagonally across the East River to the River Cafe in
Brooklyn, I felt myself pushed backward by the current, losing
headway but gaining a great view of the Brooklyn Bridge overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Heading for the Manhattan Bridge, I was forced to dodge two tugs
pushing their barges upriver. In a kind of nautical jaywalk, I had
to paddle behind one before the other arrived. Like crossing
midtown streets, it's a situation in which one should move with all
deliberate speed. As I cleared the path of one oncoming tug, I
rushed into the waves of another that had just passed.
</P>
<P>
   Like all other boats, tugs move forward by displacing water
behind them, a lot of water. Suddenly, I was in the middle of a
mini-maelstrom, being pushed violently southward amid wild eddies
one might find on a white-water river. The danger lies not in the
eddy itself but in exiting one clockwise eddy and being caught by
another turning counterclockwise. The bow of the boat alters
direction dramatically and can easily be tipped over by the sudden
change. I leaned forward and tried to anticipate when one eddy
would pass me to the next and that one to the quieter water near
shore.
</P>
<P>
   As I eluded the lines of fishermen trying their luck under the
Williamsburg Bridge, people leaned over to talk to me. ``Where are
you going?'' ``Doesn't your boat tip over?'' ``How can I do that?''
</P>
<P>
   When I got closer to Roosevelt Island, the tide slackened, the
current relented, and I started to speed up.
</P>
<P>
   Passing the United Nations building around 7:30, I was lucky to
catch a breathtaking phenomenon. I could see the setting sun
reflected in its eastern windows. I was puzzled because I could
also see the sun setting behind it. Weird. A glorious sunset
reflected from the Citibank building in Long Island City, Queens,
solved the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Then the river's mysteries became more mundane. The desolation
of the Williamsburg and Greenpoint shores lined with crumbling
buildings and salvage yards was so different from the Manhattan
side. It was difficult to reconcile the two. Between the shores, a
small island south of Roosevelt held two types of tenants:
cormorants nesting in the penthouses of the trees and sea gulls in
the cheaper habitats on the ground below. Geese flew over me, and
ducks, startled into flight, quacked rapidly out of my path.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A solo circumnavigation of Manhattan can be a dangerous thing,
especially at night. For those who do not have extensive
experience, several organizations provide stimulating, guided and
safe daytime tours.
</P>
<P>

 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Early in the process of composing incidental music
and songs for Lincoln Center Theater's current production of
Shakespeare's ``Twelfth Night,'' Jeanine Tesori went to a downtown
percussion store with her orchestrator, Rick Bassett, and made an
unusual request. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, `Show me all the instruments that nobody else
ever rents, the more exotic the better,' '' she explained recently.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The proprietor disappeared into the storage room and came back
with metallic Tibetan temple bowls that are played by rubbing a
wooden stick around the rim, much like the trick people play at
dinner parties by rubbing a wet finger on the rim of a wine glass
to produce a ringing sound. Except that the unearthly, soft,
ringing sounds these simple Tibetan bowls make are more hauntingly
beautiful than anything produced by a state-of-the-art synthesizer.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not all Ms. Tesori and Bassett walked away with that
day. The instruments used in this eclectic original score include
many of ancient ancestry, like gongs, wood blocks, chimes and bells
as well as unorthodox newer creations like the daxophone, a
German-made instrument of bowed wood with a convex finger board
that is used for a wide range of sound effects, like bird calls and
ocean waves. To these are added guitars, a banjo, cello, violin,
piano, harmonium and woodwinds. All these instruments are played by
just six versatile musicians, who collectively create an
unbelievably rich range of sound colors.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of keeping the music for ``Twelfth Night'' natural,
exotic and, most important, unamplified came from its British
director, Nicholas Hytner. ``Rick told me he wanted no microphones,
no electronic instruments,'' Ms. Tesori said. ``And that was fine
by me. When you introduce amplification into a band or orchestra
for a show, the musicians lose their ability to project because
they are being amplified and have to be careful. So more
amplification is added, and it goes on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tesori, who has done a considerable amount of conducting in
the theater, believes that the ability to balance an orchestra is
something that many conductors are not really taught. ``Instead,
there is a sound man at a control board determining that, say, more
oboe is needed, and turning up the microphone on the oboe,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music for this show is a little subversive,'' said Mark
Stewart, one of the pivotal musicians, who plays guitar, strings,
daxophone, bowls, and sundry percussion instruments, and also
contributes vocals. ``We are taking control back from the sound
board, which is quite lovely.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, the score chastises the typical blaring Broadway band,
souped up with amplification and rigidly presided over. ``Within
the confines of Jeanine's ideas, we are free,'' said Kimberly
Grigsby, the conductor of ``Twelfth Night,'' adding: ``The score is
so fluid, in a way, all I have to do is say, here we go, then trust
everybody, and keep my ears attuned to balances.''
</P>
<P>
   Hytner's stipulation about natural sound came not just from an
antipathy to amplification but also from his take on this
particular play. ``Twelfth Night'' is set in a sort of never-never
land called Illyria ruled by a handsome young duke, Orsino (played
by Paul Rudd), who is courting a recalcitrant countess, Olivia
(Kyra Sedgwick), and is attended by a loyal valet, actually Viola
(Helen Hunt), a young woman who has just survived a shipwreck and
pines for the duke but serves him disguised as a man. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To Hytner and Ms. Tesori, the fantasy elements of the story, the
timelessness of the locale and the gender-bending confusions of the
characters called for music that was equally ambiguous: elemental
yet mystical, familiar yet exotic, simple yet ethereal. Moreover,
much of the action takes place on a nearby coast, and the water
imagery that runs through the text is depicted in designer Bob
Crowley's remarkable set, on which real rain falls and which
contains real ponds and pools that the characters slosh through.
This too called for specifically evocative music.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point, Viola says of the duke, `I can sing and speak to
him in many sorts of music,''' Ms. Tesori said. ``So that's what I
have tried to provide. And, Rick Bassett, our orchestrator, brought
his incredible knowledge of world music to the job, which was very
appropriate for this play.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there is just a bit of amplified music in the score,
but involving only the electric guitar, and the daxophone, which
must be played through speakers. Otherwise, all the acoustic
instruments are played without amplification, making the Vivian
Beaumont Theater, right now, the rare Broadway theater where you
can hear the sounds of a piano, a cello, an Indian drum or
whatever, with no electronic enhancement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When the audience enters the theater, it is greeted by all six
musicians playing on Tibetan bowls tuned to different pitches, a
collected sound both eerie and strangely comforting. This segues
into music with gentle accompanimental patterns for guitar, the
soft tapping of Indian tabla, mournful string lines and a wisp of a
theme.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tesori has set the many song texts in the play,
Shakespeare's equivalent of verbal ditties, as moody poplike
minstrel songs for Feste, a jester in Olivia's court, played by
David Patrick Kelly, who strums the lute and sings in a plaintive
low tenor. There are dance sequences with fractured meters that
interrupt the action, and shimmering sustained harmonic passages
that underscore it. Several of the musicians also sing, including
Marshall Coid, a countertenor whose voice Ms. Tesori feels vividly
evokes the androgynous elements of the play. The result is a
skillful mixture of ethnic music, modal folk songs, driving dances
segments that might be from Morocco, Broadway riffs, pop licks,
chamber music and coloristic sound effects. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the theater has been what Ms. Tesori, a Port
Washington, N.Y., native, now 36, has wanted to do ever since she
switched her major from pre-med to music while a student at
Barnard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I conducted shows and worked in theater during school, but
never really studied composition,'' she said. ``I just listened a
lot, and went to as much as I could in the city.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She has worked in Broadway extensively as an arranger and
conductor, most recently doing dance and incidental sequences for
the revivals of ``How to Succeed in Business Without Really
Trying'' and ``The Sound of Music,'' the latter of which her
husband, Michael Rafter, conducts.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the work that has meant most to her so far is her own
musical, ``Violet,'' about a disfigured woman from rural North
Carolina who travels to Tulsa to be healed by a television
evangelist. Ms. Tesori gave up a well-paying job, as associate
conductor of ``The Who's `Tommy,' '' for the sake of ``Violet,''
which became a workshop production at Playwrights Horizons in 1997.
The musical developed an almost cult-like following among segments
of the audience, but received mixed reviews and did not make it to
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done a lot of helping other people with their work,'' she
said. ``But I would love, honestly, to have a show produced for
which I wrote the score, and that is hard to achieve these days,
when production costs are so high and producers are so afraid of
risk. But I surround myself with people who believe in the theater
the way it was: that is, if you tell a great story, audiences will
come, and if you make music that comes out of your heart, people
will listen.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, she is gratified by the response to her music
for ``Twelfth Night,'' which runs through Aug. 30 at Lincoln
Center, and the chance it provided to work so creatively with
stimulating musicians.
</P>
<P>
   It has been equally involving for the musicians. Before
composing a note, Ms. Tesori spent a long time with each player to
find out just what instruments they could play, whether they could
sing, what their special musical gifts were. That is an experience
far removed from the typical Broadway gig, where a musician plays
his part night after night deep in a pit while an unseen engineer
controls the projection, volume and balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once my work was done, I realized that I didn't need to come
by the theater very often,'' Ms. Tesori said. ``I didn't have to
worry about a sound man tampering with the score. And the piece
breathes musically, so it will be a little different every night.
That's what I wanted.''

ART REVIEW: TWO NEW ENGLAND SHOWS NATIVE SON WINSLOW HOMER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Maine)   (bl)  
 By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Given his life _ born in Boston, died in Prouts Neck, Maine _
and rugged themes, from deep woods to open sea, it's small wonder
that Winslow Homer (1836-1910) is a New England institution.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't even surprising that two museums of the region are
currently staging shows of his work. The Norman Rockwell Museum in
Stockbridge, Mass., is presenting ``Winslow Homer: Artist and
Illustrator,'' while the Portland Museum of Art in Maine has come
up with an ambitious but more familiar survey, ``Winslow Homer
Facing Nature.''
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, the smaller show at the Rockwell museum,
built to honor the corny but cherished American illustrator,
focuses on the magazine and newspaper side of Homer's art. The show
in Portland celebrates the 15th anniversary of the Charles Shipman
Payson building, put up in recognition of Payson's gift of 17
Homers, and it covers the full range of the artist's career. Still,
the exhibitions complement each other nicely and in some areas even
overlap.
</P>
<P>
   Apprenticed to a lithographer at 19, Homer soon graduated to
freelance drawing for Ballou's Pictorial and, beginning in 1859,
Harper's Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   He did appealing genre scenes: bustling streets, college life,
country festivals, cotillions, seashore vignettes. But his career
took off with the Civil War, which Harper's sent him to cover.
</P>
<P>
   By then, he knew how to draw for woodblock reproduction,
producing strong, simple designs in shallow perspective, a
technique that was to affect his later painting style. From the
front, he dispatched illustrations regularly, in the process honing
a gift for pictorial narrative that carried through his career.
</P>
<P>
   There are examples in both exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   The Portland show has ``The War for the Union 1862 _ A Cavalry
Charge,'' done for Harper's Weekly, an old-fashioned European-style
battle scene of flailing sabers and fallen horses. In the Rockwell
show, ``Our Women and the War,'' also done for Harper's in 1862,
depicts several touching but very Victorian vignettes of women
knitting, sewing and tending wounded men.
</P>
<P>
   But an even more poignant scene, ``Our Watering Places: The
Empty Sleeve at Newport,'' that appeared in Harper's in 1865, shows
a maturing style.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp, close-cropped and focused on two individuals, it depicts
a young belle driving a gig, while beside her sits a somber veteran
with an empty sleeve pinned to his chest.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the war, Homer had become one of the most popular
illustrators in the best magazines of the time. When it was over,
he resumed his attractive renditions of everyday life, particularly
Americans at play, but the work was clearer and more cleverly
thought out.
</P>
<P>
   A vivid ice-skating scene, done for Frank Leslie's Illustrated
Newspaper in 1866, has a carefully off-balance composition, closing
in on three dashing skaters in the left foreground, their backs to
the viewer. The scene may reflect Homer's awareness of the
sophisticated Japanese prints known to artists of the time, but he
had also learned draftsmanship and composition from the technicians
he worked with.
</P>
<P>
   The real interest of the Rockwell show is its focus on the play
back and forth between Homer's paintings _ during the war, he had
begun to work in oils _ and his illustrations. He mined the former
for magazine material, and sometimes vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   His famous painting of schoolboys at play, ``Snap the Whip''
(1872) _ shown here, alas, in reproduction _ also appears as an
illustration in Harper's in 1873, with more clarity and detail than
the original.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Seesaw,'' a watercolor of 1873, depicts four boys playing
on a seesaw balanced on rocks. But in a Harper's illustration the
next year, three girls playing cat's cradle have been added to the
same scene, taken from a different 1873 watercolor in which they
were playing with a lobster.
</P>
<P>
   A similar juxtaposition is made in the show at the Portland
Museum, where Homer's famous Civil War painting ``Sharpshooter''
(1863), portraying a rifleman taking aim while perched in a tree,
is paired with ``The Army of the Potomac _ A Sharpshooter on Picket
Duty,'' from an 1862 issue of Harper's. In this case, however, the
painting, tightened up in its composition, appears to have been
made after the illustration.
</P>
<P>
   The Portland show, with some 50 paintings, drawings and
engravings, essentially addresses the prevailing theme of nature in
Homer's work, from pastoral views to scenes of trapping and fishing
in the Adirondacks to encounters with the ocean, like
``Weatherbeaten'' (1894), a magnificent rendition of the sea as it
writhed and thrashed against rocks near his Prouts Neck studio.
</P>
<P>
   Included, too, are a number of works done in Cullercoats, the
English fishing village on the North Sea where Homer went in 1881
to renew himself and his subject matter. He not only recorded the
ravenous ocean, hungry for sailors and ships, he also focused on
the women of the village, strongly built ``fishergirls'' very
different from the playful American princesses he had once
delighted in.
</P>
<P>
   For the splendid ``Windy Day, Cullercoats'' (1881), he used a
combination of graphite and gouache on brown paper to draw one of
these stalwarts, standing on the shore, a basket on her muscular
arm, as the wind whips the sail of a boat behind her and makes a
sail of the apron she wears over her dress.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, so taken was Homer with the fisherwomen that he later
portrayed them as types in Maine settings, for example in ``Down
the Cliff'' (1883), a watercolor made near his studio that shows a
lone woman standing against the sky, her dress blowing, a basket on
her arm.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly enough, the show includes a tiny pair of artist's
mannequins dressed by Homer in fisherwomen's garb, which he
apparently used as an aid once back from England.
</P>
<P>
   For those who know Homer's work, these two shows will provide a
productive revisit. For those who think they don't, the rewards are
great.

 &HT;    `Daughters' chronicles U.S. women's often-turbulent battle to
become airborne
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 23: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Hillary Rodham Clinton announced in March that Air Force
Lt. Col. Eileen Collins would be the first woman to command an
American space flight, the first lady declared the assignment ``one
big step forward for women.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Amelia Earhart's Daughters'' documents how giant a leap it
was. Academics Leslie Hayns-
</P>
<P>
   worth and David Toomey chronicle the histories of two groups:
the women aviators who ferried aircraft during World War II, and 13
women pilots who hoped to be astronauts in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   The authors' method of telling the story woman by woman makes
for a readable, though patchy history. By the last page, one craves
some analysis and wishes that race and class issues had been as
directly addressed as gender discrimination. Still, this book fills
in gaps in the past and is vital to women's studies and aviation
history.
</P>
<P>
   Two names especially emerge from World War II annals: Jackie
Cochran, director of the Women's Airforce Service Pilots (WASP)
training program, and Nancy Harkness Love, founder of the Women's
Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron (WAFS).
</P>
<P>
   The WASP secretly trained to ferry aircraft in Houston and
Sweetwater, Texas, with the volunteers passing themselves off as a
women's basketball team. Ignoring a directive to avoid flying
during menstrual cycles, the WAFS went on to ferry troublesome
planes such as the P-39, while the WASP trained in craft including
the B-26, so tricky it was known as ``The Widowmaker.'' Gen. Hap
Arnold found that the women were willing to take on dangerous
assignments feared even by accomplished male pilots.
</P>
<P>
   By 1944, he was so pleased that he urged armed service
recognition for the WASP (the military did not even pay for the
women's burials). But, the authors write, some male civilian pilots
and veterans groups protested, and the women did not receive the
same benefits accorded the WAC and WAVES. When the Air Force cut
back at the end of the year, the WASP was disbanded. Congress did
not approve their veteran status until 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,074 women who trained at Sweetwater flew more than 60
million miles in every Air Force craft. Thirty-eight died, some in
training, some on duty. The women returned to their families or
other war efforts. Some were offered jobs from commercial airlines
_ as stewardesses.
</P>
<P>
   Between the war and the space age, it was almost impossible for
women to receive jet training. Cochran managed to train privately
with Chuck Yeager and became the first woman to break the sound
barrier in 1953. But women, such as aviation executive Jerrie Cobb
of Oklahoma City, were proficient civilian instructors or test
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb met Randolph Lovelace, director of the Albuquerque, N.M.,
astronaut medical testing clinic, at a 1959 conference. When Cobb's
boss suggested that she be considered for the space program,
Lovelace listened. He knew the Russians were planning to use women
cosmonauts.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, Cobb, who had been appointed a NASA
consultant, and 25 other women _ including Myrtle Cagle of Macon _
went through the relentless medical and stress tests at the
Lovelace Clinic. The 13 who passed were ordered to report to
Pensacola, Fla., for flight testing, but just before their
departure the secret program was abruptly canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Dietrich, one of the 13, wrote about their experience for
McCall's magazine. The aviators received hate mail _ some from
women _ telling them to go home and take care of their kids.
Congressional hearings into the fitness of women as astronauts went
nowhere partly because they had not been trained as jet pilots.
</P>
<P>
   On June 13, 1963, Valentina Tereshkova of Russia became the
first woman in space. She was greeted with cheers and flowers in
Moscow. Khrushchev departed from his prepared text, looked at
Tereshkova, grinned, shook his finger at the crowd and said, ``Here
is your weaker
</P>
<P>
   sex. ...''
</P>
<P>
   That was almost two decades before Sally Ride's historic flight,
and more than three decades before Feb. 3, 1995, when Collins
became the first woman to pilot a U.S. spacecraft. Watching from
the VIP stands in Cape Canaveral, Fla., were her special guests:
former members of the WASP and seven of the original women tested
for the astronaut program.

 &HT;    Another `best' list, but this history took some thought
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 23: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when you thought you'd heard the end of it, just when the
howls of hilarity and cries of indignation had died to subdued
chuckles and mutterings, it's back. Another List of 100 Books
Better Than All Others _ and James Joyce's ``Ulysses'' didn't make
it.
</P>
<P>
   This one is called ``The 100 Most Influential Books Ever
Written: The History of Thought From Ancient Times to Today''
(Citadel Press, $34.95), and it beats the socks off Modern
Library's best 20th-century novels in English.
</P>
<P>
   That list, you'll recall, prompted so much high dudgeon you
might have thought an official inquiry were in order. Only last
week, in the pages of The New Yorker, William Styron, a member of
the Modern Library jury that hasn't forgotten ``The Magnificent
Ambersons,'' tried to distance himself from the verdict. Styron
explained, plausibly enough, how ballots by mail led to a system of
tallying whose results were, well, weird. ``When I saw the final
roster,'' Styron writes, ``I was a little shocked at what the 10 of
us had wrought, not only in respect to the list's glaring omissions
(no Toni Morrison, no Patrick White, only eight women in the lot)
but in respect to its generally oppressive stodginess.''
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Martin Seymour-Smith, a jury of one, pronouncing with
confident assurance that a different set of books stands above all
others. These are not just books in English, not just books written
in this century, not just novels; Seymour-Smith means, so to speak,
the entire library, from ``The I Ching'' to ``The Feminine
Mystique.'' Unlike the Modern Library jury, though, he doesn't set
himself the trap of ranking 1 through 100. (To do so ``would have
been too frivolous and would have begged far too many questions.'')
Instead he chose 100 that ``have exercised, if sometimes in devious
and very subterranean ways, the most decisive influence upon the
course of human thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Author a respected biographer, critic
</P>
<P>
   It's necessary to speak of Seymour-Smith in both the present and
the past tense. He is in every sense another Dead White Male _ he
died July 1 at his home in England. More important, he was a
distinguished biographer and critic who unleashed his opinions with
a wit and relish that might have saved the Modern Library jury from
charges of superannuation and senility.
</P>
<P>
   Seymour-Smith is not afraid to assert or to judge. John Locke
was ``the shifty and emotionally indecisive, but gifted, English
philosopher ... to whose thinking America owes its constitution.''
(A bit overstated on all counts?) Betty Friedan, in ``The Feminine
Mystique,'' ``could not possibly (have anticipated) that within 25
years male-controlled magazines, nominally edited by women, would
be publishing psychologically unconvincing and merely fashionable
tales of `liberated' women. It would have been fatal for her to
have seen that feminism would soon turn into pseudofeminism.'' (But
what of the reaction against feminism by females themselves?)
</P>
<P>
   A task like Seymour-Smith's is undertaken boldly or it is not
undertaken at all. When bets are hedged and punches pulled, the
entire enterprise collapses from dullness. Implicit in ``The 100
Most Influential Books Ever Written'' is the assumption that
readers will agree here, disagree there. Seymour-Smith pays them
the compliment of having minds of their own. He comes to converse
more than to canonize.
</P>
<P>
   Some masterpieces missing
</P>
<P>
   How different this is from the Modern Library jurors, who merely
checked off titles supplied them by Random House. Consider that a
single book made both lists: George Orwell's ``Nineteen
Eighty-Four.'' Orwell's novel, ``as well as satirizing Stalinist
`purity' and deceit ... anticipates the almost exactly parallel
development of the equally drab and tyrannical `political
correctness' of our own times.''
</P>
<P>
   Missing from Seymour-Smith's list are any number of masterpieces
_ not only ``Ulysses'' (No. 1 in the Modern Library rankings) but
also Scott Fitzgerald's ``The Great Gatsby'' (No. 2), the entire
corpus of Hemingway, Faulkner and Toni Morrison (nothing like being
denied twice). The point is not literary merit, but influence over
the way we think and act.
</P>
<P>
   To that Seymour-Smith would add, ``for better or worse.'' Thus,
the Old Testament and New Testament, the Koran, Thomas Paine's
``Common Sense,'' Freud's ``The Interpretation of Dreams,'' Franz
Kafka's ``The Trial,'' Darwin's ``The Origin of Species'' and
90-some others.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, they add up to what the historian Arthur Lovejoy
called ``The Great Chain of Being.'' The mathematician Norbert
Wiener, selected for his 1948 book ``Cybernetics,'' put it more
nicely still: ``We are swimming upstream against a great torrent of
disorganization. ... It is the greatest possible victory to be, to
continue to be, and to have been. ... No defeat can deprive us of
the success of having existed for some moment in time in a universe
that seems indifferent to us.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: It's not in glee that I recalled Macon killer
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A letter from a former resident of Macon, Georgia takes me to
task for referring to Anjette Lyles, ``the Macon murderess,'' in a
column last week.
</P>
<P>
   She says I ``gleefully'' made the reference, and I assure her
there's nothing gleeful about my recollection of the 1958 murder of
two husbands, a mother-in-law and a 10-year-old daughter by the
platinum-haired restaurant operator, who is now dead.
</P>
<P>
   Their suffering from arsenic, which she was convicted of feeding
them, was so hideous, it is painful now _ 40 years later _ to think
of it. As I recall, I had the case on my mind because I had just
talked to a young woman who has written a book about the Lyles
murders and trial.
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Jaclyn White; the book, still untitled as far as I
know, is to be published by Mercer University Press. It is so
voluminous and brilliantly researched that if family members of
Anjette Lyles are sensitive to my one-line reference to her, they
may want to get out of the country before this book comes out.
</P>
<P>
   The former Macon resident who wrote to me detailed her family's
friendship with the Donovan and Lyles families, Anjette's own
relatives and her in-laws. She wrote, ``Putting ourselves in their
places, imagine the ordeal that family went through. ... They
struggled through it, managing to keep living normal lives and
conducting themselves with the grace and dignity that we should all
hope to emulate should such an event be thrust upon our own
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   As one who has covered a number of murder trials and become
fairly well acquainted with some murderers, I know that almost
always the murderer's family suffers unabated grief and
humiliation. I didn't realize Anjette had so many relatives left
after the slaying of two husbands, a mother-in-law and a daughter.
I assumed that her younger daughter, Carla, who would be about 47,
is alive and well, but I don't know where. She was taken from
Anjette and may have grown up protected from details of the
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   My correspondent tells of one family member who emphatically was
not protected: Anjette's brother. He died a few months ago after
reading in The Macon Telegraph a story on the infamous criminals in
the city's history, featuring Anjette's case. He had a heart attack
and died the day after that article was published, my correspondent
wrote, adding, ``Coincidence? Cause and effect? We will never know.
He was, after all, in his 70s and had a heart condition anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, I am sorry for his suffering and for any I may have
caused anybody. I do resent the letter writer's belief that there
was a ``media frenzy'' surrounding that case.
</P>
<P>
   I covered the Lyles story for the Constitution; Margaret
Shannon, since retired, covered it for the Journal; Hugh Schute
covered it for The Associated Press. Different staff members
covered it for the Macon papers, coming and going as the trial
progressed, and by no means frenziedly.
</P>
<P>
   There was no thundering herd act, no yelling questions at
Anjette, no pushing and crowding for a view of her. We were
assigned seats in the courtroom balcony, and we listened quietly,
nauseated and horrified as the details of the crimes were related
from the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   Anjette died of heart failure Dec. 4, 1977, at the state
hospital in Milledgeville. She was 52. She is buried in the
churchyard at Coleman's Chapel in Wadley, in Jefferson County,
beside her first husband, ``Little Ben'' Lyles, and daughter
Marcia, both victims of the arsenic-heavy Terra Ant Bane.

 &HT;    Why isn't a pregnant woman's immune system attacking and
destroying fetuses?
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Georgia researchers have solved a 45-year-old riddle: Why
mothers are able to carry babies to term.
</P>
<P>
   It's an ability most people never question. Yet it has puzzled
scientists since 1953, when a British immunologist pointed out that
fetuses, being genetically different from their mothers, should be
rejected by their mothers as foreign tissue _ but they aren't.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the Medical College of Georgia and the
University of Georgia have discovered the mechanism that keeps the
mother's immune system from attacking and destroying fetuses. The
findings appear in today's issue of the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery someday could lead to new treatments for
auto-immune diseases such as juvenile diabetes, rheumatoid
arthritis and multiple sclerosis. It also might help scientists
better understand how to prevent miscarriages or rejection of organ
transplants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a rather surprising mechanism, which no one had
previously guessed at,'' said study co-author Andrew Mellor, a
molecular geneticist and immunologist at MCG in Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, a body's immune system attacks any foreign cells that
enter it. Foreign, in this case, could mean anything from
disease-causing bacteria to a life-saving transplanted organ.
</P>
<P>
   But no one considered that fetuses might also fall into this
category until 1953, when Sir Peter B. Medawar spotlighted the
apparent contradiction that mammalian fetuses survive in utero,
despite differing genetically from their mothers. Mammalian
offspring inherit genes from both parents.
</P>
<P>
   Medawar later won a Nobel Prize in medicine, but his paradox has
remained unsolved until now.
</P>
<P>
   The key lies in an enzyme, called IDO, that is created by cells
in the placenta, the membrane through which the mother delivers
nourishment to and removes wastes from the fetus. The placenta is
the barrier as well as the interface between mother and child.
</P>
<P>
   IDO acts as a sort of local anesthetic, by suppressing the
mother's immune system within the placenta. It does this by
breaking down tryptophan, an essential amino acid required by
T-cells, which orchestrate the body's immune system responses.
</P>
<P>
   Mellor and his colleagues tested their barrier mechanism theory
in mice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reasoned that when we block that mechanism, the mother
would now see the fetus as foreign tissue and reject it,'' Mellor
said.
</P>
<P>
   When the researchers inhibited the mechanism in pregnant mice,
they all miscarried.
</P>
<P>
   In another set of experiments, scientists confirmed that the
genetic differences between the mother and its fetus are
responsible for incurring rejection when the barrier mechanism
fails or is inhibited.
</P>
<P>
   To prove this, the research team used strains of mice specially
inbred to be genetically identical. They mated mice who were
essentially twins. The female mice, therefore, conceived fetuses
who also were their genetic duplicates.
</P>
<P>
   When the researchers blocked the barrier mechanism in the
pregnant mice, nothing happened. The mice carried their pregnancies
to term _ because their bodies didn't recognize the pups as
foreign.
</P>
<P>
   A final confirmation of the theory was the observation that mice
that lack immune systems were able to carry and deliver genetically
different pups. No barrier mechanism was needed in these mice,
because no immune system existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rarely, I think, do you find such clear-cut results that
absolutely agree with the hypothesis like this,'' said Emory
immunologist Judith Kapp. ``It's the kind of study we all dream
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Much more research must be done, though, to understand
specifically how the barrier mechanism works.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just at the infancy stage of doing these experiments,''
said Dr. David Munn, a pediatric oncologist at MCG who also
co-authored the study. ``We're just so floored at having found this
mechanism to investigate.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are now studying whether the barrier mechanism in
the placenta occurs elsewhere in the human body. But new treatments
based on the research are years away.

 &HT;    ``That '70's Show'' is true to form with a little innocence
mixed in
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fox dribbles out the new TV season at 8:30 p.m. EDT Sunday with
``That '70s Show,'' an amusingly slight sitcom that follows a group
of Wisconsin high school friends in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   With this creation of Bonnie and Terry Turner (``3rd Rock from
the Sun''), Fox finally finds a smartly subversive family that
isn't animated. Think ``Happy Days'' meets ``Dazed and Confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Ground zero here is the basement rec room of Eric Foreman
(Topher Grace), a likeable, clean-cut kid eager to earn his
teen-rebel stripes. The spacious basement is where the teens hatch
plots to pocket beers from their parents' upstairs disco party;
watch ``The Brady Bunch'' without the sound; smoke a little pot _
all with a '70s nonchalance that looks almost staggering today.
</P>
<P>
   Eric is aided and encouraged in his pursuits by a teen
menagerie. Donna (Laura Prepon) is a neighbor since childhood whom
Eric now awkwardly realizes has grown up gorgeous. Kelso (Ashton
Kutcher) is an accidental Romeo always ready to dump his girlfriend
Jackie (Mila Kunis) even as he gets more involved with her. Hyde
(Danny Masterson) is a bright kid capable of spotting a corporate
conspiracy where none appears to be. And foreign exchange student
Fez (Wilmer Valderrama) seems to absorb American culture just to
mangle it.
</P>
<P>
   They're not bad kids; they just want a taste of being bad. Their
parents get that, and the two sides exist with a knowing, even
loving distrust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonder where they're going?'' Eric's mother (Debra Jo Rupp)
asks her husband when she hears Eric and his friends getting into
the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of town,'' Eric's father (Kurtwood Smith) answers
off-handedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You sure?'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' he answers. ``I told them not to.''
</P>

<P>
   ``Baby'' lacks common sense
</P>
<P>
   Babies are always pooping, fathers are inept, and women, even
one you just met a few minutes ago, are perfectly suited caregivers
for your infant, right?
</P>
<P>
   That's the inane setup for Fox's other new fall sitcom ``Holding
The Baby'' (7:30 p.m. EDT Sunday), that's also the network's latest
assault on parenthood and common sense.
</P>
<P>
   John Patrick Walker stars as Gordon, a corporate-climbing ad
exec who neglects his family and drives his wife to attend ``a
stupid woman's retreat'' from which she _ understandbly _never
returns. Ill-equipped to care for their 6-month-old son, Gordon
enlists the help of his brother Jimmy, an unemployed playboy, and
Kelly, a grad student who is conveniently applying for a job at the
firm when his life falls apart.
</P>
<P>
   Silly and tasteless, the show depends on baby Dan's prodigous
bodily functions for most of its jokes. But in the end, ``Holding
the Baby'' is nothing more than a soggy diaper that reeks.

   Rock a surrvivor of the late-night battles
</P>
<P>
   While others battle for the ``The King of Late Night'' title,
comedian Chris Rock is content being the undisputed clown prince of
cable.
</P>
<P>
   Rock's self-titled late-night talker starts its third season
tonight on HBO (11:30 p.m.EDT) with celebrity guests Johnnie
Cochran and British hip-hop sensation Tricky.
</P>
<P>
   While Rock has spent most of his career in obscurity, the last
two years have seen him become a Nike pitchman, a Grammy-winning
comic, a movie star, and a survivor of the late-night talk show
battles that have claimed other well-intentioned hosts such as
Keenen Ivory Wayans, Sinbad and ex-basketball star Earvin ``Magic''
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Rock says his show has been successful because it's only on once
a week, and even though he's on a cable network, the
commercial-free environment gives him the creative freedom to say
whatever he wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in the mass business and I didn't get into show
business to work every day,'' Rock said during a telephone
interview. ``I'd rather play 5,000 seats than 105,000 seats as long
as people get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rock said he has sympathy for the other talk show hosts
who became late night casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to judge those guys, Magic was supposed to fail.
I don't mean that in a bad way. If I played guard for the Lakers,
I'd probably fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock said even if he got a chance to host a broadcast network
show and play to larger audiences, he'd avoid making the same fatal
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason they give talk shows to comedian,'' he said.
``You gotta really be focused on comedy _ not on guest wars and the
muscial guests. You have to give people good comedy. They don't
want a sexy or hip show, they just want to laugh. The funniest guy
is the hippest guy. The funniest guy is the sexiest guy. I'm not
really criticizing those shows, but they tried to outhip each other
instead of trying to out-funny each other.''

GET THAT LAPTOP OFF YOUR SHOULDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHEN C. MILLER 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Laptop vendors are not in the business of selling carrying cases
for their products, except as a courtesy. Most will offer a decent
case, but it usually has just enough room to carry the laptop, the
power supply and little else.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are cases that offer plenty of space and are easy
to transport -- because they're on wheels.
</P>
<P>
   When I did a roundup of laptop carrying cases a year ago, the
premise was that many people spend a lot of money for a computer
and then dump it in a cheesy, cheap bag that offers little
protection for their investment. That situation hasn't changed
much. But the latest rolling cases offer enough advantages that
business travelers might want to consider upgrading.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who travel for a living have to carry much more that
just a laptop. We still need a briefcase for all the paper that is
generated in this so-called paperless society. And we need
something to protect all the other electronic devices we lug
around: computer peripherals, cellular phones, pagers and so on.
Not to mention telephone cords, batteries and various other bits of
hardware.
</P>
<P>
   A good bag should also protect more than just the computer -- it
needs to protect your health. Several vendors have finally decided
that a rolling case is useful for many travelers because it can
handle all the extras while getting all that weight off your
shoulders and keeping your knuckles from dragging on the floor in
airports.
</P>
<P>
   Port has a new case called the EasyRoller. The folks at Port
make first-rate bags, but the marketing department should do better
research. The advertisements claim that the EasyRoller is the first
computer briefcase on wheels. Lodis might be a little surprised by
that claim -- I've owned one of their rolling computer briefcases
for nearly a year. And at last year's Comdex computer show, I found
several roller bags.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing gaffe aside, the EasyRoller is a nicely designed
unit. The telescoping pistol-grip handle seems very sturdy, and I
like the fact that the release button is on the handle. I've never
been fond of the ones that force you to bend over before you can
make the handle retract.
</P>
<P>
   The EasyRoller has a large compartment in the rear that provides
a fair amount of flexibility through the use of what Port calls
``System 2000'' modules. One module lets you carry a second laptop.
Another module lets you carry a portable printer and a Zip drive
with accessories. A third module is a file folder, and the final
module is for extra clothes and a toiletries bag. The EasyRoller
retails for $149, and each of the modules is $29. While Port is
taking orders, it won't ship the EasyRoller until late August or
early September.
</P>
<P>
   Targus' Pilot Case is one of two rolling units in its product
line. It is a hard-side case and has space for both a laptop and a
printer, or even a second laptop. The two outside pockets can hold
a cell phone and a personal digital assistant. The laptop
compartments are loaded from the top, but there is a side
compartment that holds all your office supplies and drops down as a
portable desk. The Pilot has a street price of $190.
</P>
<P>
   The other rolling case of interest is from Anvil Cases. It is
called the Speedster and has a retractable handle. The case is
designed to withstand the rigors of airline baggage handlers. It is
custom-made to your specifications so you can have all the
compartments you want, but there's a price to pay -- around $500
depending on the options you choose.
</P>
<P>
   While the other bags are first-rate, they still lag behind the
Lodis Exec-on-the-Go. As far as I'm concerned, this case set the
standard. I've carted it everywhere and in all kinds of conditions.
It has held up through a daily commute on the New York City subway
system, and it still looks brand new. The only problem I've had is
a cracked ring on one of the handles, but I'm not eager to be
without the bag for the time it would take to ship it back for
repair. It's a problem that I can live with until the ring actually
breaks.

FILMMAKER SUES OVER TERMINATION OF E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  By CARL S. KAPLAN 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last summer, Peter Hall, a New York-based independent filmmaker,
was readying the premier of his first feature, ``Delinquent.''
There were film critics to schmooze, T-shirts and postcards to
print and a Web site to design. The writer-director planned to
coordinate much of the promotion by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   But about a month before the premiere, Hall was alarmed to find
that he was unable to access his e-mail account. He said he called
customer service for his Internet service provider, Earthlink
Network Inc., and was told that the company had closed his account
because he had ``illegally accessed another provider's service.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was complete gibberish,'' Hall recalled recently. ``I felt
they were accusing me of doing something that wasn't kosher, but I
didn't know what. It was a totally impossible and absurd situation.
I had done nothing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Hall fought back. He went to court to seek over
$7 million in damages from Earthlink, claiming injuries to his film
business and mental health stemming from the allegedly wrongful
disruption in e-mail service. According to legal papers filed in
federal district court in Manhattan, the lawsuit charges Earthlink,
based in Pasadena, Calif., with breach of contract, libel,
negligence and a violation of the Electronic Communications Privacy
Act, among other counts.
</P>
<P>
   Kirsten Kappos, a spokeswoman for Earthlink, said the company
would vigorously fight the lawsuit. ``Our investigation is ongoing,
and based on preliminary information, we have factual and legal
defenses and we will aggressively defend ourselves,'' she said. She
declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Legal and online experts say the novel case could help establish
needed rules of the road for ISPs who want to shut down an e-mail
account -- which can be a lifeline for many small entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's travails began on Aug. 6, 1997, when he turned on his
computer to check his e-mail and found that his password was
refused. This was bad timing. His film, five years in gestation,
was set to be unveiled in five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few days, after several anxious phone calls and
letters to the company, plus some media coverage, Hall discovered
that Earthlink's ``abuse'' department had labeled him a
``spammer,'' someone who sends out vast amounts of unsolicited
e-mail. Specifically, an Earthlink official accused Hall of
spamming America Online subscribers at 3 a.m. on Aug. 1, according
to court papers. Spamming is a violation of Earthlink's
subscription agreement and is grounds for immediate termination of
an account upon notice to the subscriber.
</P>
<P>
   Escalating the situation, Earthlink on Aug. 6 posted to three
separate public discussion groups a ``Net Abuse Report'' that
referred to Hall's e-mail address, ``lot99,'' and announced that
the account had been terminated, according to the complaint. ``(We)
continue to make every effort to rid the world of Spam,'' the
message said. Hall claims in his court filing that he was falsely
accused and had his account terminated without the required notice
or an opportunity to defend himself.
</P>
<P>
   Six days after the e-mail issue began, Hall got the full
account. He was told by a security official at UUNet Technologies
Inc., which carries network traffic for many ISPs, that it had
mistakenly told Earthlink he was a spammer. The mixup was evidently
due to a false tracking number on a real spammer's output that
matched one on some of Hall's messages. UUNet informed Earthlink of
the mishap five days after Hall discovered that his account was
closed, according to the court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Earthlink eventually tried to make up with Hall by offering him
six months of free service, but Hall said he declined the offer.
``I started yelling at them'' over the phone, he said. ``It was the
first time I yelled at them. I had already spent more money than
the offer was worth on telephone calls, letters and admission to a
hacker convention,'' he added, referring to a meeting of hacking
aficionados in New York City where he had hoped to find a savvy
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In his lawsuit, Hall claims Earthlink defamed him when it posted
a message to a discussion group that indicated the movie director
was a spammer. And at least some online experts think the term
``spammer'' is sufficiently contemptible to amount to libel.
``Spammers are scum,'' said Paul Hoffman, director of the Internet
Mail Consortium, a trade group for Internet mail companies. ``I
don't know anyone who wouldn't find the term 'spammer' heavily
pejorative.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Bass, a Washington-based lawyer who has a large
Internet-related practice, added: ``Assuming the facts are there
(as alleged in the complaint), and assuming he can show actual
financial injury, he's got a good (libel) claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Grosso, a lawyer for Hall, said he believed the case was
legally significant because it could result in a ruling that an ISP
has a legal duty to give a customer notice of an impending account
termination and a reasonable opportunity to defend against the
charge -- whether such obligations are spelled out in a subscriber
contract or not.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Grosso said, ISPs have a legal duty to promptly
forward e-mail from a closed account to a subscriber's new account.
Grosso claimed that Earthlink did not fully forward Hall's old
e-mail -- nearly 600 messages -- to his new account until recently.
At the least, said the lawyer, an ISP should bounce e-mail back to
the sender when an account is closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are saying there is a duty in cyberspace for an ISP to
deliver the mail or send it back,'' Grosso said.
</P>
<P>
   Such legal obligations for ISPs are not universally recognized
at present, said Hoffman of the Internet Mail Consortium.
</P>
<P>
   But that may change. According to Bass, an ISP's suspension of
an e-mail account on the basis of one accusation of abuse is ``an
unwise and risky action for an ISP to take.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new area of law, but I have no doubt that courts
will find that ISPs have some liability for the erroneous,
intentional blocking of e-mail,'' Bass said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Hall says he is trying to move on to his next
film. Could it be about e-mail? ``No way,'' he said. ``People think
my legal story is a great idea for a movie, but how exciting is a
computer screen? You can't make a movie about making telephone
calls and sending faxes and being driven out of your wits.''

CLASSICAL CDS WITH THE SCORE AND MORE
</HEADLINE>
  By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   And now it's time to sing along with Maurizio.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of following the bouncing ball, keep your eye on the
computer monitor. As Maurizio Pollini tickles the ivories on three
little numbers we like to call the Beethoven piano sonatas Opus 22,
26 and 53, the sheet music scrolls past and a vertical stripe of
color highlights the onscreen notes as they are played.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, the pianist's flying fingers outpace the computer,
especially in the speedy presto passages. For the most part,
though, the sound that streams from the speakers is synchronized
with the marker as it glides over the page.
</P>
<P>
   Pollini is one of the leading pianists of our time. These
splendid performances, live recordings made in 1997, have been
preserved on a standard -- and standard-priced -- audio compact
disk released in the United States in April by Deutsche Grammophon.
</P>
<P>
   But the disk is also the first in a series of ``CD-pluscore''
titles developed by the venerable German music publisher Schott. An
indirect descendant of the Voyager Company's line of classical
music CD-ROMs, it is essentially an enhanced CD, except that the
multimedia material supplementing the audio content is richer than
the usual jumble of video clips and interactive games that
characterizes the ECD format. As a bonus, the scores for the
``Waldstein'' sonata (Op. 53) and the two earlier works can be
printed out in their entirety.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pollini's pianistic pyrotechnics would probably prevent
any kind of sing-along session or keyboard karaoke, Deutsche
Grammophon and Schott deserve a chorus of hosannas for allowing the
complete scores to be tracked with precision while the disk spins
in the CD-ROM drive of a PC-compatible computer.
</P>
<P>
   Staring into the screen, one can easily imagine sitting at
Pollini's side during a concert and serving as his page-turner --
except that the computer flips the pages at just the right moment.
Even those who cannot read music are likely to enjoy following the
rise and fall of the notes and ``seeing'' the silence whenever
musical rests occur.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, the scores have been cross-linked with a
musicological analysis, penned by the Beethoven expert Barry
Cooper, that pops up in an adjacent window. The text describing
each movement is divided into sections like ``exposition'' and
``recapitulation,'' and it is further cross-linked with a glossary
defining ``arpeggio'' and other relevant terms.
</P>
<P>
   This analysis can be read while the audio disk plays from start
to finish, but the speaker icons that introduce each section of the
text call up the relevant musical passages, enabling listeners to
hear how Beethoven constructed the sonatas.
</P>
<P>
   Thoughtful touches abound. A timer can be set to track minutes
or count bars, making it easier to find the related commentary in
the adjacent text. Cooper has also provided a Beethoven chronology
and some brief biographical essays. The sheet music can be printed
as-is, or with user-supplied marks for fingerings, tempo and
dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   The software on the disk, including the score, takes up less
space than 50 seconds of audio data, according to Katya Kratzer,
manager of Schott's multimedia division.
</P>
<P>
   Kratzer explained that the score was synchronized to the
performance by hand, bar by bar. She acknowledged that the vertical
marker that tracks the score will sometimes appear to pause,
showing the points where Pollini is taking the subtle liberties
with rhythm that help to personalize a musical interpretation.
``It's been done on purpose to show the rubato a little bit, to
show where he's 'improvising,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Did the pianist, who is known for his formidable technique, ever
cause problems by departing from the score?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not Pollini,'' Kratzer said with a laugh. ``He never misses
notes. There are other artists who do, but it is really amazing how
exactly you can synchronize Pollini's playing to the score.''
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, Deutsche Grammophon recently issued the next two
titles in the CD-pluscore series: a collection of easy piano pieces
played by diverse performers, and ``Cellissimo,'' a set of newly
published arrangements for the cellist Mischa Maisky. The disks
have yet to be released in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Although no more Pollini disks are planned for the series, a
string-quartet project is in the works, as is a 4-CD box of the
complete Beethoven violin sonatas played by Anne-Sophie Mutter.
Kratzer said the CD-pluscore system could also be applied to
orchestral recordings, but that their large-format sheet music
makes them impractical for display on the small-screen monitors
that dominate the European computer market.
</P>
<P>
   Some future releases will contain MIDI (musical instrument
digital interface) files so that, for example, an amateur pianist
could accompany a computer-generated version of Mutter playing the
``Kreutzer'' sonata, altering the tempo to suit his or her skill
level. Pollini vetoed this feature on his disk, Kratzer said,
``because he did not want his music to be changed by the user.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, IDG Books and the EMI record label teamed to produce
the Classical Music for Dummies series of enhanced CDs. The disks
</P>
<P>
   contained essays written in a cutesy style and interactive
features that were not well-executed, including scrolling scores
for short works accompanied by computer-generated beeps and some
bland descriptive text.
</P>
<P>
   With CD-pluscore disk, Deutsche Grammophon and Schott have
realized a brighter idea. This is classical music for smarties, and
anyone can play.

L.A. SCHOOL DISTRICT ACCUSED OF SOFTWARE PIRACY 
</HEADLINE>
  By PAMELA MENDELS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Officials in the Los Angeles Unified School District have
learned the hard way that software -- like textbooks, desks and
other school supplies -- is not free.
</P>
<P>
   The district faces the possibility of paying almost $5 million
to settle accusations of software piracy brought by the Business
Software Alliance, a coalition of software publishers, including
Microsoft Corp., based in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles's difficulties began two years ago when coalition
officials, acting on a tip to their anti-piracy phone line, began
investigating whether the West Valley Occupational Center, an adult
vocational school under district jurisdiction, had pirated software
running on its computers.
</P>
<P>
   The group said it found 1,400 copies of unlicensed software in
use, including Microsoft Word and Adobe Photoshop.
</P>
<P>
   The Business Software Alliance is asking, among other things,
that the school district pay $300,000 -- the approximate value of
the copies -- to the group's anti-piracy fund. But the big ticket
items in the proposal are requirements stipulating that any
unlicensed software running in other Los Angeles schools be
replaced with licensed copies and that the district establish a
team to train staff members in copyright do's and don'ts -- efforts
that district officials say would cost about $4.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Los Angeles Unified School District declined
to comment, saying the accusations were the subject of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   However, David N. Tokofsky, one of the seven members of the
district school board, said that while he does not condone software
piracy, he is unhappy with how the Business Software Alliance has
acted, likening the anti-piracy phone line to the use of moles. He
also said that with the millions of dollars software companies
spend on advertising touting the educational value of their
products, he felt they could afford to help a poor urban school
district like Los Angeles train staff members in copyright
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have said, 'We don't want the $300,000,''' Tokofsky
said, and instead given ``an offer of training, reconciliation and
understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. Kruger, vice president of enforcement for the Business
Software Alliance, rebutted the criticism, pointing out that
tipsters to the phone line are not rewarded and that software
makers often help school districts by offering them discounted
prices for software. Furthermore, he said, the proposed settlement
is less an effort to collect money than it is an effort to
encourage the school district ``to eliminate reliance on pirated
software.''
</P>
<P>
   Software makers hope the financial rap on the knuckles will
serve as a warning to other schools around the country to make sure
that programs running on school computers are licensed copies.
``Could this serve as an example to other school systems?'' Kruger
asked. ``I would hope so. Not just because there are financial
interests attached, but because it points to the right thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Kruger said that unauthorized use of software is widespread by
both individuals and companies, estimating that for every four
pieces of software in American hands, one is a pirated copy. He
acknowledged that it was impossible to ascertain whether that
proportion applies to schools, too.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jamieson A. McKenzie, a former school superintendent
who advises schools on how to use technology and publishes an
online journal on the subject, believes, based on anecdotes, that
the problem in schools is widespread. ``In many places, people
think 'the software is for kids; it's for a good cause and there's
nothing illegal about it,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But another education expert indicated that the Los Angeles
example was unusual. For one thing, said E. Joseph Schneider,
deputy executive director of the American Association of School
Administrators, ``there is not a school district in the country
that would not have a fairly well-spelled-out policy about
authorized software use on the books.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, it is standard procedure in most school
districts to have computer technicians regularly run software
programs that tell them what other software is running on the
computers under their care. If unauthorized copies are found, they
are purged, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is not just the desire of school officials to comply
with copyright laws, added Schneider, whose organization represents
about 16,000 school superintendents. Computer viruses often begin
with a piece of what he called ``refugee'' software. And school
officials want to swiftly eliminate any potentially problematic --
or controversial -- programs that may be introduced to school
computer systems by mischievous youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   For Sarah B. Alexander, a spokeswoman for Microsoft, there is
another issue: Too often, she said, people who would not dream of
stealing, say, a book, believe it is legitimate to use software
without paying for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do they justify it?'' she asked. ``Just because it's
easier to make a copy of software than a desk or a book?''

GERMAN STUDENTS BUILD A NEXT-GENERATION 'SHOPBOT' 
</HEADLINE>
  By BRUNO GIUSSANI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As commercial venues on the Internet continue to multiply, it
has become increasingly difficult to find the best bargains.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for a book, for example, chances are that
you'll search for it at one of the big American online bookstores,
like Amazon.com, Barnes &AMP; Noble or Borders and end up buying it
from one of these stores.
</P>
<P>
   But is the price they charge really the lowest possible? What
about delivery deadlines? How do you know there isn't another
lesser-known store somewhere on the Web that can ship it cheaper
and faster?
</P>
<P>
   Enter the shopbots, or shopping robots, software agents that
automate traditional Web surfing and search the Internet for the
best prices or shortest delivery times. Shopbots have long been
regarded as a technology with the potential to revolutionize
consumer retailing on the Internet by making comparative shopping
easy and fast.
</P>
<P>
   They may ``help to overcome the barriers that keep consumers
from using the Web,'' said Heather Stark, a principal with Ovum, a
British consulting company. ``They can make the Web faster and more
reliable, and make online shopping a convenient experience,'' she
added in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Stark and her team estimated in a study that total revenue
earned from agent-related sales on the Web will hit $1.6 billion by
2001, up from $19 million in 1996 and $159 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet so far shopping robots have been fairly primitive. The
category's ancestor, Andersen Consulting's Bargain Finder, searches
10 online stores for the price of a compact disk and displays the
results on a single page. Since its launch two years ago, however,
Bargain Finder has not been developed any further.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, other services like Yahoo's Shopguide, Snap's
Deal Finder or Viaweb's Shopfind have hit the Web. They cover a
broad spectrum of products, from sporting goods and flowers to
computers and peripherals, but they work much like a standard
search engine and don't provide the buyer with a good comparison of
the retailers' offerings beyond prices.
</P>
<P>
   Two young Germans have now gone a step further toward a
``smarter'' shopping agent.
</P>
<P>
   While studying economics at the University of Heidelberg, over
the last year Christopher Muenchoff, 22, and Christoph Janz, 21,
have been developing Acses, the most interesting example to date of
the way shopbots may evolve.
</P>
<P>
   Users of Acses can search for a book by title, author, keywords
or an International Standard Book Number (ISBN).
</P>
<P>
   Unlike all the other systems, Acses does not submit queries
directly to the bookseller's Web sites. It digs first into
Muenchoff and Janz's own database, and comes up with all the
matches.
</P>
<P>
   A search for ``Into Thin Air,'' for example, would bring up
references to books from seven different authors with the same
title. Users can then select Jon Krakauer's best-selling account of
the tragedy that occurred on Mount Everest two years ago, in the
format they prefer (hardcover, paperback, audio).
</P>
<P>
   This allows the system to identify the unique ISBN number
attached to the exact book the user is looking for.
</P>
<P>
   The query is then sent to the online bookstores based on this
number, but not before an additional layer of information is added:
users are asked about their geographic location and how they would
like the prices displayed (half a dozen currencies are available at
the moment).
</P>
<P>
   Then the Acses robot checks 25 American, German, British and
Australian online bookstores -- new ones are constantly added --
and returns the matches ranked by price. Prices include shipping
and handling charges calculated according to the location of the
customer, and delivery time is displayed as well.
</P>
<P>
   Clicking on a link takes the customer directly to the store,
where she can actually buy the book.
</P>
<P>
   Handling and delivery information are unavailable from Acses's
competitors, yet both are essential to allow the comparative
shopper to weigh shipping time against price and thus find the
buying scheme that best suits her needs.
</P>
<P>
   To take another example, Arie De Geus's management book ``The
Living Company'' was available from over a dozen different
bookstores. At $22.83 Books.com clearly had the best price, but
shipping would take 6 to 12 weeks, while Barnes &AMP; Noble, when using
a parcel service, would guarantee delivery in 3 to 5 days --
charging $53.41.
</P>
<P>
   Studying the list, however, I found two other stores that best
matched my preference for both a reasonable all-inclusive price and
a quick delivery. Kingbooks of the United States promises shipping
in 3 to 7 days and would charge $29.95, while for an extra dollar
Bookpages of Britain (recently acquired by Amazon) would have the
package delivered at my door in 4 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often, lesser-known stores are cheaper,'' Janz said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   To make the service even more effective, Muenchoff and Janz have
introduced a couple of enhancements.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid wasting time waiting for one slow Web site to answer
the queries, users can define a maximum access time, say 18
seconds, after which the search is timed out and the slow store is
excluded from the displayed list -- which, in return, may encourage
online booksellers to install powerful servers and high-speed
connections.
</P>
<P>
   If somebody wants to buy 10 books, it is possible to launch an
parallel Acses search for the entire package.
</P>
<P>
   Janz concedes that his and Muenchoff's system is far from
perfect, and that shopbots in general still suffer from a high
level of customer wariness, especially when it comes to reliability
and privacy protection.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, exporting the model to goods other than books may be
difficult. ``Technically, books are easy targets for our software
robot because of the standardized ISBN number,'' he explained.
``Since the same product is available from all retailers, price and
shipping time are the only variables on which a customer makes a
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The system may be used for other commodity items like CDs or
diskettes -- and indeed, as more online buyers start to use
shopbots, retailers in these markets may soon feel downward price
pressure. But in other sectors, consumers may still want to see and
touch the products they want to buy, and take into consideration
other factors like service after the sale.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, even Acses is still a pale imitation of true
personal agent technology in development in labs around the world,
which, Stark said, could even take into consideration ``situations
where your software agent meets my agent and they negotiate for
prices and conditions.''

CELEBRATING THE OTHER STAGE AT SALZBURG  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 23) 
</HEADLINE>

 Anne Midgette writes frequently on international art, music and
theater  
 By ANNE MIDGETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALZBURG, Austria _ In the opinion of Joseph F. Troy, who heads
the board of the American Friends of Salzburg, ``Critics and
audiences alike have long acclaimed the Salzburg Festival as the
leading music festival in the world.'' To Alberto Vilar, the
organization's president, it is ``the premier summer classical
music festival.''
</P>
<P>
   Most international music lovers would agree. To them, the name
Salzburg Festival evokes the musical legacy of the conductor
Herbert von Karajan, who from the 1960s until his death in 1989
dominated the Austrian festival with concerts and traditional
productions of star-studded operas.
</P>
<P>
   But to German speakers, who make up some 80 percent of the
festival's audience, Troy and Vilar's definitions are strikingly
incomplete. After all, it was a theater director and a playwright,
as well as a composer, who founded the festival in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo von Hofmannsthal, the playwright, poet and opera librettist
(``Der Rosenkavalier'') summed up the goals he shared with his
co-founders, the stage director Max Reinhardt and the composer
Richard Strauss: a festival devoted to ``opera and drama
together.'' Traditionally, then, the Salzburg Festival has always
been a festival not only of music, but also of spoken theater.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the festival's first-ever production was a
spoken-theater piece. ``Jedermann'' (``Everyman''), Hofmannsthal's
adaptation of a medieval English morality play, which Reinhardt
staged on the square in front of Salzburg's cathedral, is still
presented every year. For German speakers, this play _ more than
Karajan, more than Mozart _ is the quintessential symbol of the
Salzburg Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there is more spoken theater at Salzburg than ever
before, from the theater guru Robert Wilson's new staging of Georg
Buchner's play ``Dantons Tod'' (``Danton's Death'') to the
``Troilus and Cressida'' of Stefan Bachmann, 31, the incoming
director of the Basel playhouse, to the filmmaker Hal Hartley's
first-ever work of theater, ``Soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that theater at the festival hasn't had some setbacks since
the days when Reinhardt's grandiose productions of Goethe's
``Faust'' and ``Jedermann'' were mainstays of the program. When
Germany annexed Austria in 1938, the Nazis quickly removed from the
festival all traces of Reinhardt and Hofmannsthal, who were part
Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   In the early years of the cold war, the composer Gottfried von
Einem, the festival's progressive new artistic director, tried to
engage an equally progressive theater director, the playwright
Bertolt Brecht: but Brecht, a Communist, was denied the post, and
the flap over the would-be appointment forced von Einem to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there has always been theater at the Salzburg Festival,
even under Karajan. In the early 1970s, Giorgio Strehler, the late
Italian avant-garde director, flirted with the post of theater
director, but abandoned the idea after his less-than-successful
productions of ``Das Spiel der Machtigen'' (``The Game of the
Powerful,'' based on Shakespeare's ``Henry VI'') and ``Die
Zauberflote.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, the directors Claus Peymann and Dieter Dorn, leading
lights of the German theater, staged works by the Austrian
playwright Thomas Bernhard.
</P>
<P>
   But it took Gerard Mortier, a Belgian from the world of opera,
to put the spotlight back on theater in Salzburg. In 1991, Mortier
took over as the festival's artistic director and introduced a
whole new program focusing on avant-garde stagings, 20th-century
opera and contemporary music _ and lots of spoken theater.
</P>
<P>
   Mortier signaled theater's ascendancy by boosting the festival's
theater budget and appointing Peter Stein, one of the most highly
regarded stage directors in the German-speaking world, as theater
director. Dubbed ``the Callas of directors'' by one German critic,
tein invoked Reinhardt's spirit by mounting large-scale productions
of Shakespeare plays and Greek tragedies in the Felsenreitschule, a
huge performance space in what had been a riding arena hewn from
Salzburg's cliffs.
</P>
<P>
   Critical response was mixed, but theater attendance figures
soared. Stein's 1992 ``Julius Caesar,'' which traveled to the
Edinburgh Festival in 1993, may have been a comfort to those
patrons scared off by ``Saint Francois d'Assise,'' an opera by
Messaien, presented at Salzburg in a video-studded staging by the
American director Peter Sellars. Stein, says Mortier, ``put theater
in Salzburg back on the map.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stein also represented some things Mortier didn't like. His
monumental productions of classic works seemed, critics said,
increasingly ``tired out,'' and he left little room on the program
for talent other than his own. To Mortier, who is almost blindly
devoted to cultivating new talent, Stein represented an old guard,
albeit an old avant-garde.
</P>
<P>
   What Stein wanted to do was ``Faust'' in the Felsenreitschule _
again following Reinhardt _ but he ultimately decided that it
wasn't possible on his budget. Citing ``frightful battles'' at
Salzburg, he left willingly when his contract ran out in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Stein's departure, Mortier, newly confident after
having extended his own contract until 2001, announced his plan to
run every aspect of the festival's artistic program himself.
Theater was to be placed largely in the hands of four stage
directors _ Sellars; the then-unknown Bachmann; Deborah Warner,
from the nonprofit English stage, and the eccentric Swiss director
Christoph Marthaler _ to be supervised by a ``Konsulent,'' a kind
of administrative consultant in a part-time job.
</P>
<P>
   But things worked out a little differently in practice. For all
of Mortier's desire to control the artistic program himself, a
theater director, whatever the title, is a necessary part of his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need a theater director because I can't cast plays alone,''
Mortier says. ``I'm an opera man. I can cast operas with no
problem, but I need someone for German theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Only an individual with an insider's knowledge of the
German-language theater scene can assemble the leading actors who
bring Salzburg's theater onto a qualitative par with its music,
such as the excellent company in ``Dantons Tod,'' which gave new
animation to Robert Wilson's esthetically pleasing but increasingly
repetitive theatrical language.
</P>
<P>
   And for all of Mortier's internationalism, the hottest pure
theater at the Salzburg Festival is still in German. In addition to
``Jedermann,'' the sellout productions this year were ``Dantons
Tod'' and ``er nicht als er'' (``he not as himself''), a play by
the Austrian writer Elfriede Jelinek, who is the 1998 festival's
author in residence.
</P>
<P>
   Staging this piece's world premiere was the Swiss director Jossi
Wieler, who won the German theater critics' production of the year
award in 1994 for his last Jelinek staging, ``Wolken. Heim''
(``Cloud. Home'') at the Deutsches Schauspielhaus in Hamburg. His
strikingly creative interpretation of ``er nicht als er,'' in which
he converted a block of text written without characters or stage
direction into a face-off between Jelinek and the late Swiss poet
Robert Walser, could well come up for the same honor.

AMTRAK MANAGERS FILE BIAS SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ESTELLA DURAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amtrak managers filed a class-action lawsuit
Thursday alleging that the company discriminated against
African-Americans in management and other white-collar positions.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 plaintiffs _ who also include former managers, job
applicants, and one white former employee _ said Amtrak has paid
black managers and professionals less than whites, has not promoted
or hired blacks fairly, has condoned the use of racial epithets,
and has retaliated against those who have filed complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is the second discrimination charge against Amtrak
this year in US District Court in Washington. Black track-laying
and repair workers in the Northeast filed a class-action suit in
April, also charging unfair treatment of blacks and likening Amtrak
to a ``plantation.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' lawyers said they want Amtrak to change its
employment and disciplinary practices, and they are seeking damages
for back pay and mental anguish. Lawyers said they could seek more
than $100 million to represent two groups _ one of about 700 black
managers and former managers and one including about 2,500 black
applicants who the company rejected.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the allegations, Amtrak officials said Thursday
the company works to prevent discrimination. ``Amtrak has a
zero-tolerance policy for discriminatory practices in hiring or in
any aspect of the workplace,'' said George D. Warrington, Amtrak's
acting president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always worked hard to ensure that our hiring,
promotion, and employment practices do not discriminate and that
all employment opportunities are open to people of all races,
religions, and ethnic origins, without regard to gender or
disabilities that can be reasonably accommodated.''
</P>
<P>
   Four attorneys' groups are representing the plaintiffs in both
lawsuits, including the Washington law firm of Sprenger &AMP; Lang, the
Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs,
the Boston Bar Association's Lawyer's Committee for Civil Rights
Under Law, and the Boston firm of Shapiro, Haber &AMP; Urmy.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier lawsuit, which included two Amtrak workers from
Massachusetts, opened the door for the second suit, lawyers said.
They hinted that more suits may be in store.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we filed that complaint, we received a flood of calls
from Amtrak employees that led us to believe that the extent of
racial discrimination is much broader than the first lawsuit,''
said Michael Leider, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday, plaintiffs detailed instances in
which they said they were victims of racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Perry, a former manager at Amtrak in Philadelphia,
complained that she was not allowed to advance at the company, and
she said the company did little to stop co-workers who use racial
epithets, even after she filed complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The white female plaintiff, Leslie Dunning of Fairfax Station,
Va., said Amtrak demoted her in retaliation for helping a black
manager prepare a report that detailed discrimination within the
company.

 SALZBURG, Austria: same honor.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While ``it's good to have the big foreign companies come in,''
Mortier says, ``the Salzburg Festival needs its own productions as
well.'' Only by generating new work can the festival remain more
than just another stop on the international circuit, presenting
fashionable productions already seen in New York or Avignon,
Edinburgh or the Wiener Festwochen (Vienna Festival).
</P>
<P>
   And as a leader of the German-language performing arts, the
festival is more or less obliged to present most of its own theater
productions in German. The theater network in Germany, Austria and
Switzerland is virtually unparalleled; its symbol is the Berlin
Theatertreffen (Theater Meeting), which showcases the year's best
German-language productions. Salzburg, of course, wants a piece of
that action, particularly as the Wiener Festwochen is also
dedicated to funky new-wave theater.
</P>
<P>
   Mortier has been keenly aware of Vienna, at the very least since
Luc Bondy, who had done several stagings for Mortier's festival,
became the Festwochen's theater director and said he would not
return to Salzburg. Sellars and Marthaler, both loyal, also have
presented or will present work in Vienna. The powers that be on
Vienna's theater scene ``attack me,'' says Mortier, ``but then they
hire my directors.''
</P>
<P>
   As a proponent of ``the new,'' Mortier _ who sees himself as
someone who presents new talent and points it in new directions
(commissioning the filmmaker Hartley to do theater, for example) _
comes in for his share of criticism.
</P>
<P>
   He is profaning the festival's tradition by overwhelming it with
new work, says one faction; he is a mere slick packager in search
of the latest trends, says another.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for theater at the festival to remain
predominantly German-language is that the festival wants to tap
into the German theater world's financial resources. Salzburg
receives relatively little state financing for a European cultural
institution: 74 percent of its budget comes from ticket sales and
private sources.
</P>
<P>
   As opera is far more expensive than theater to produce, the
theater budget is but a slice of Salzburg's financial pie, pared
down after Stein's departure to cover only the theater program's
fixed operating costs. Salzburg's theater has to come up with all
the money for artistic expenditure itself.
</P>
<P>
   Co-productions with other theaters have taken on new importance:
German theaters can afford to help pay for productions that, while
they originate in Salzburg, will also bring them prestige. All of
this year's new theater productions except ``Soon'' will travel to
other German-speaking houses.
</P>
<P>
   Given this background, it is not surprising that once the
appointed Konsulent _ the critic and theater administrator Ivan
Nagel _ had proved himself congenial to Mortier, he was designated
``theater director,'' after all, on this year's program.
</P>
<P>
   Nagel's choice of productions is, Mortier says, ``closer to my
own wishes than Stein's: smaller productions, more contemporary.''
In assembling this year's program, Nagel was given a more or less
free hand. ``I make suggestions,'' Mortier says, ``but the final
decision is his.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Nagel's decisions was to play down the role of Mortier's
group of directors: only Bachmann was represented on the 1998
theater program. In practice, rule by committee was less useful to
the festival than a single, decisive man of German theater.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the inner workings of Salzburg have proven as rocky for
Nagel as for his predecessors, and, one year into his three-year
contract, he has already resigned. Nagel took the deliberately
provocative step of inviting Elfriede Jelinek to organize the
literary readings that have traditionally been a part of the
festival.
</P>
<P>
   This would be tantamount to inviting the American performance
artist Karen Finley to stage the Inauguration. Ms. Jelinek is an
abrasive, controversial figure who attacks the Austrian
establishment and the social status quo, particularly with regard
to the role of women, in difficult, confrontational texts.
Salzburg's board of directors, whose president is a woman, was not
amused.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Jelinek program was ultimately approved (and has
been extremely successful with audiences), Nagel was so
disillusioned by what he called Salzburg's behind-the-scenes
``intrigues,'' that, pleading ill health, he will be leaving at the
end of this season.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than viewing this as another opportunity to step in, take
charge and mount more international productions, Mortier
immediately sought out another German-theater administrator.
Nagel's all-but-official successor is his own protege, Frank
Baumbauer, currently director of the Deutsches Schauspielhaus,
which he has led three times to the German theater critics' award
for theater of the year.
</P>
<P>
   One sure thing on next year's theater program is, of course,
``Jedermann.'' No one quite knows what to do with it. Originally,
Reinhardt's staging was hailed as an example of the director's
brilliance: playing the action off the statues on the cathedral's
Baroque facade, he incorporated the lengthening shadows of evening
as lighting effects, so that the steeple of St. Peter's Church
casts its shadow over centerstage at the moment Death appears to
claim Everyman.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the production has deteriorated into something
of a costume pageant. The role of Everyman is traditionally taken
by the leading actor of the day, from Will Quadflieg in the 1950s
through Klaus Maria Brandauer in the 70s to Gerd Voss today.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of Sellars, the current staging involves ``what
people expect of theater: their favorite actors standing up there
talking very, very loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Mortier dared to lay hands on this sacred cow at the
beginning of his tenure, his departure from Salzburg might have
been precipitous. Today, with a stronger support base and less to
lose, he has a few ideas of his own about how to incorporate the
new and hip into this rather dated piece _ and make international
audiences aware of Salzburg's spoken theater, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should turn it into a musical,'' he says, with a twinkle in
his eye, ``and cast it with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another option: every year there's a big debate in the press
about who will play the paramour, the girl. I want to cast it with
Leonardo DiCaprio. That should make everybody happy.''

 Deborah Weisgall recently wrote in this section about the Wyeth
galleries in Maine.  
 By DEBORAH WEISGALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Clifford Ackley, the curator of prints, drawings and
photographs at the Museum of Fine Arts, was walking through his
exhibition ``PhotoImage: Printmaking '60s to '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   He stopped in front of ``License,'' a lithograph by Robert
Rauschenberg dating from 1962. Quick strokes of black are brushed
over a montage of pictures: a stalking Siamese cat, a car race, a
phalanx of horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are images of speed, photographs taken from The New York
Times,'' said Ackley, a soft-spoken man in pale horn-rimmed glasses
and a dark plaid shirt. ``When I came to the museum 32 years ago,
`License' was my first acquisition. My field was 17th-century
Northern European prints.'' He smiled. ``I still love the 17th
century. Can you imagine a world where one was not surrounded by
photographic images?''
</P>
<P>
   For ``PhotoImage,'' at the museum through Sept. 27, Ackley has
turned his galleries into an eloquent montage of images that all
make use, in various ways, of photographs. Luscious lipsticked
lips; a grid of glass eyes; a face printed so delicately that it
almost disappears; hazy stills from the Zapruder film: they are
disparate images, often ugly or banal or frightening, transformed
into art.
</P>
<P>
   ``PhotoImage'' explores that process of transformation; it is
Ackley's summation, his ordering of the outrageousness, violence
and irony _ and beauty _ of the art of the last three decades.
</P>
<P>
   It is also very personal. ``This is an autobiographical show; it
covers the same decades that I cover,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many works in the show come from the department's collection,
acknowledged to be one of the finest in the world. In the '60s and
'70s, the museum's shows of Durer, Rembrandt and Goya, to which
Ackley contributed, set a standard of scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Now he does the same for contemporary prints. The exhibition
includes 120 images by 72 artists, some of whom were not born when
Rauschenberg and Andy Warhol first began experimenting in 1962.
Most are represented by one or two works.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I emphasize four artists,'' said Ackley. ``Rauschenberg,
Warhol, the British artist Richard Hamilton, and the German artist
Gerhard Richter.'' Their innovations have entered our visual
vocabulary, and their recurring presence gives the exhibition its
narrative thread.
</P>
<P>
   ``This show is dense,'' Ackley observed. It is also didactic in
the great tradition of MFA print shows. The sheer wealth of
material allows Ackley to suggest visually complex ideas. ``I have
arranged it by theme, not chronologically. Portraits, words and
images, a section concerned with seeing, landscapes.'' He pointed
to a mysterious hovering cloud by Gerhard Richter. ``He's always on
the verge of becoming a 19th-century romantic painter.''
</P>
<P>
   Beside the Richter hangs a small picture of water by Vija
Celmins, a square of waves that proves not to be a photograph at
all but a finely detailed woodcut.
</P>
<P>
   Ackley's labels describe how each print was made: for instance,
how a photograph was altered, what the artist added mechanically or
by hand, the source of the photographs. For Ackley, meaning and
process are intertwined. Two small seascapes by Roy Lichtenstein
layer photographs of water and sand with horizons of Ben Day dots
and skies of luminous patterned plastic.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, such cheap commercial materials were provocative enough
almost to obscure the print's strong connection to the tradition of
landscape. ``With photography, there's always the high-art, low-art
dialogue,'' said Ackley. ``But is there really any difference?''
</P>
<P>
   Farther along the wall, confrontational works from the '70s _
close-ups of a handgun, or Chinese, Soviet and American flags
blended by their blood-red color _ contrast with edgy images from
the '90s hanging across the room: intensely colored ink-jet prints
of bondage scenes from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's my political corner,'' Ackley says. ``Some things are
correct, some incorrect.'' Their troubling beauty lies in the
elegant way ugly objects are presented, in the patterns of the
guns, the sensuous red of the flags, the velvety, seductive blues,
purples and oranges of women wearing bits in their mouths.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition doubles back on itself and suddenly two images
hanging far apart connect with each other. Along one wall, Ackley
has hung a string of Mao portraits: a cross-dressing clown Mao by
Jim Dine, a soft-focus man-in-the-moon Mao by Gerhard Richter and,
by Warhol, a strung-out, neon Mao.
</P>
<P>
   Everything resonates; an overly exposed image becomes fresh. The
Chinese dictator represents a contest between the power of history
and art. Across from them hangs a block of 24 frames composing
Christian Boltanski's portfolio ``Gymnasium Chases.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The work shows members of the graduating class of 1931 from a
Jewish high school of that name in Vienna, enlarged from a small
group photograph. Grainy and hollow-eyed, each face has been so
enlarged that it seems ready to explode. They prefigure their own
fates in the Holocaust; almost anonymous victims of history stare
across at the icon Mao.
</P>
<P>
   ``PhotoImage'' is full of tensions like this, between
recognizable images and those that have been pushed to the edge of
recognition, changed into something else, perhaps even into a lie.
</P>
<P>
   The invention of photography propelled painting toward
abstraction; ``PhotoImage'' shows how photographs have bullied and
coaxed art back to the real world. ``Photography still has an
edge,'' Ackley said, and everywhere he plays with the pull between
our response to the content of an image, its subject, and our
response to what it looks like, its esthetic qualities.
</P>
<P>
   On the wall next to the grid of ``Gymnasium Chases'' hang a
Rauschenberg with three oblong photographs arranged vertically, a
Celmins in which three pictures of space line up side by side, and
two images by John Baldessari containing small, mysterious, printed
oblongs. Ackley considered the wall. ``Fun with squares and
rectangles,'' he mused.
</P>
<P>
   Ackley has his own fun with squares and rectangles in the
exhibition catalogue. Operating like the artists in ``PhotoImage,''
he manipulates photographs of the works in the show and juxtaposes
them, often differently from the way they hang on the walls; he
blows up details, to clarify how they are made and also because
they look good big.
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful in itself, the catalogue documents this exhibition in
the same way that some of the most haunting prints in
``PhotoImage'' document temporary installations and performances.
</P>
<P>
   The catalogue's cover is a cropped Warhol ``Marilyn,'' garish
and gorgeous in teal, silver and Day-Glo pink. Warhol, especially,
exploited the issues of lies and low art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Boston in general, I held back on Warhol,'' Ackley said
as he stood in front of four ``Marilyns'' at the entrance to the
exhibition. ``The show is going to Des Moines next year. Halston
left his Warhols to the Art Center there; he was from Des Moines.
The heartland. That's where I come from, too. I was raised in
dairy-farming country in Oregon.''
</P>
<P>
   Like any autobiography, the show reflects on time passing. Much
of the art of the '60s and '70s deals with conflict: between public
and private, between cheap images and high art, between abstraction
and representation. Dieter Roth's ``Six Piccadillies'' is six
versions of a tourist postcard. In one Piccadilly, the busy London
hub blossoms into psychedelic color; in another, a train of three
infrared double-decker buses trundles through a black night. Three
decades ago, they might have seemed out of control; now they
dazzle.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade outrage has mellowed; it is once again
permissible to be decorative, to beguile. Richter, in ``Candle I,''
squeegeed black paint calligraphically over a photograph of a
burning candle and achieved a golden Dutch interior viewed through
centuries of soot.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Schatten'' (``Shadows'') by the Swiss artist Markus Raetz,
shapes bent from a single piece of wire drift like puffs of smoke
above a Magritte-like pipe twisted from the same wire. The six
images seem to have been captured in an instant, but the artist has
painstakingly fashioned the inert materials and exposed them on
photographic paper. It is very beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   All the works in ``PhotoImage'' are beautiful. The show, by
making connections among method, color, form and subject, reveals
the beauty in a hermaphrodite dancing in front of credit cards, in
the ghostly vanitas of an X-rayed skeleton, in a purple snapshot of
Joseph Beuys crouching before a shimmering silver horse.
</P>
<P>
   Ackley finds subtle beauty in charged, blatant images that snag
the eye, a core of delight in images that lie. He locates beauty in
an age that mistrusts it and works to deny it: beauty, almost
despite itself.
</P>
<P>
   Ackley smiled wryly. ``I am a romantic,'' he said. ``So I always
end up with something beautiful.''

`KAATERSKILL FALLS': DEBUT OF GIFTED NOVELIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The opening sections of Allegra Goodman's eloquent first novel,
``Kaaterskill Falls,'' suggest a Shakespearean comedy of manners:
There are allusions to ``A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' and hints
that the novel's backdrop _ a bucolic New York village in the
Catskills _ is one of those magical green places where confusions
can be resolved and transformations effected. The reader expects
that the novel's two mismatched couples _ Elizabeth and Isaac
Shulman and Andras and Nina Melish _ will somehow sort out their
marital problems during their summer in Kaaterskill, and that their
summer neighbors, too, will somehow resolve their dilemmas during
their vacation in this upstate Eden.
</P>
<P>
   Although the novel does not disappoint such expectations, its
outcome is a far cry indeed from Shakespeare's romantic rondelets.
Ms. Goodman's visitors to Kaaterskill are followers of a strict
Orthodox rabbi called Rav Elijah Kirshner: Not only are adultery
and divorce unthinkable, but also their lives are ordered by dozens
of rituals and rules, regulating everything from what they may wear
to what sort of ovens they can use to cook for the holy days.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goodman does a marvelously sympathetic job of conjuring up
the circumscribed world of the rabbi's followers, conveying the
frustrations and rewards of their intensely religious life. She
shows us just how interconnected her characters are, and how
momentous the most seemingly ordinary events _ picking a name for a
child, deciding to cater a party, becoming friends with a Gentile
or nonobservant Jew _ can be in their hermetic world.
</P>
<P>
   As in Ms. Goodman's two accomplished collections of short
stories (``Total Immersion'' and ``The Family Markowitz''), the
tension between tradition and change, familial responsibility and
personal autonomy, continuity and flux provides the motor for her
narrative. In fact, her main characters divide into pairs of
traditionalists and rebels, ideologues and iconoclasts.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Shulman accepts the strict demands of his faith with
unquestioning ardor, while his wife, Elizabeth, yearns for contact
with, if not immersion in, the outside world. Nina Melish, who has
come late to religious tradition, has grown increasingly dogmatic,
even as her husband Andras, who lost most of his family in the
Holocaust, has grown increasingly skeptical about God and the
rituals of belief.
</P>
<P>
   As for Rav Kirshner's sons, they, too, represent two poles:
Jeremy, a professor at Queens College, has embraced the
intellectual passion of his father, while repudiating his religious
dogma; his younger brother, Isaiah, has become his father's
cautious, self-conscious heir-apparent, a dutiful but rigid rabbi
who insists upon the letter, not the spirit, of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Although these neat pairings of dichotomous characters might
sound a bit schematic, Ms. Goodman writes with such supple
understanding of her people that the reader quickly forgets the
superstructure of her novel to become absorbed in the small, daily
dramas of their lives. So authoritative is her storytelling that
she is able to move from one character's point of view to another's
and back again to an omniscient overview without missing a beat. As
a result, the reader comes to understand the frustrations, fears
and hopes of each character, even ones like Rachel, Isaiah's
feisty, bullying wife, who might ordinarily emerge as simple
villains or clowns.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Ms. Goodman demonstrates, as she did in ``The
Family Markowitz,'' her instinctive grasp of familial dynamics, the
ways in which dreams and emotional habits are handed down and
translated from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
   We see how Rav Kirshner's sons (reminiscent in many ways of the
brothers in ``The Family Markowitz'') have split his intellectual
and religious legacy into two realms. We see how Renee Melish
struggles to reconcile her mother's expectations with the
imperatives of adolescence. And we see how Elizabeth has bequeathed
to her daughters her own hopes of living a double life _ one, safe
within the confines of her religious faith, and the other, daringly
independent in the outside world, where women might become doctors
or lawyers or writers.
</P>
<P>
   The one weakness in this novel stems from Ms. Goodman's efforts
to personify that outside world in several year-round residents of
Kaaterskill Falls: a local real estate baron named Michael King,
who is trying to buy up land around the town; King's onetime lover,
Candy Walker, a born-again Christian who has had a child out of
wedlock, and Una Darmstadt-Cooper, an eccentric hermit who lives in
the woods. These subsidiary characters are sketchily defined and
they are poorly integrated into the main story, as though they were
vestigial creations from an earlier draft of the novel or hasty
afterthoughts, scribbled in at the last moment.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, these people are only minor distractions,
easily overlooked and easily eclipsed by the humanity of Ms.
Goodman's central characters. Indeed, ``Kaaterskill Falls''
ratifies the achievement of the author's short stories, even as it
announces the debut of a gifted novelist.

HIGH COURT RULES QUEBEC HAS RIGHT TO SECEDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA _ Weighing in for the first time on the emotional
political issue that has clouded Canadaian politics for decades,
the nation's highest court ruled Thursday that Quebec cannot
unilaterally break away from the 131-year-old confederation.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a historic opinion that appeared to undercut the
federal government's claim that Canada is indivisible, the Supreme
Court also declared that Quebec has a right to secede in an
orderly, democratic fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's nine high court justices ruled unanimously that Quebec
has no legal right to unilaterally split from Canada on the basis
of a simple majority ``Yes'' vote in a province-wide referendum, as
it came within a hair's breadth of doing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of the unequivocal legal ruling against secession
that the federal government had sought, the high court declared
that if Quebecers one day opt for independence in a fair vote,
Canada has a ``constitutional duty'' to negotiate terms of
separation in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice Antonio Lamer, himself a Quebecer, described the
case as the most important ever to come before the Canadian high
court. The opinion spelled out in a 78-page ruling effectively
marked the first official acknowledgement by Canada that Quebec has
a right to secede, if only under structured terms. In that sense,
the ruling backfired on Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst seemed caught off-guard by the ruling, and suggested
that it might deepen the rift between the nation's ``two
solitudes'' _ French Quebec and English Canada _ since it gives the
appearance of federal meddling in Quebec politics while failing to
legally define the rules of national breakup.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a surprise, and certainly not what the federal
government wanted or expected,'' said Ghislain Otis, a professor of
law at Quebec's Laval University. ``Instead of simply saying Quebec
has no right to secede, as Ottawa hoped, the justices have said
that Canada has an obligation to negotiate terms of secession if
Quebecers clearly choose this path.''
</P>
<P>
   Quebec's secessionist leaders shrugged off the ruling, saying it
was irrelevant and that Quebec will determine its own political
future without reference to English Canada. The province had
boycotted the high court hearings that led to Thursday's landmark
ruling, refusing to argue its case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position remains that Quebecers have always had, and will
continue to have, the inalienable right to pursue our national
destiny,'' said Jacques Brassard, Quebec minister for
intergovernmental affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came as Quebec heads for provincial elections, likely
to be called in the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard, an ardent separatist, has
pledged to hold yet another referendum on secession, perhaps as
early as next year, if his Parti Quebecois government is
re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard maintains that Canadian constitutional law has no legal
sway over Quebec, and that Quebec will pursue political
``sovereignty'' regardless of Supreme Court rulings or threats from
Ottawa. ``It is not up to the Supreme Court to determine the
legitimacy of Quebecers' right to decide their own future,''
Bouchard said.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that Quebec has a right to pick its political path
without reference to the rest of Canada is an article of passionate
faith among French-speaking Quebecers, even those who favor
remaining within the confederation.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the ruling put federalist champion Jean Charest, head of
Quebec's Liberal Party and Bouchard's only serious challenger for
the premiership, in the bizarre position of arguing that Quebec
must remain a part of Canada -- but that the Supreme Court has no
legal authority to keep Quebec in the fold.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial Supreme Court ruling comes three years after
Quebec stunned observers by bringing Canada to the brink of
dissolution.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1995 provincial referendum on independence, the separatist
side won 49.4 percent of the vote, sending a political shock wave
that reverbrated not only across Canada but in Washington and other
foreign capitals. Quebec's leaders planned to issue an immediate
``unilateral'' declaration of independence had the referendum been
won by even just a single ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The near-miss caused the federal government to ask the Supreme
Court to rule on three legal questions: Can Quebec secede
unilaterally -- that is, on its own accord -- under Canadian law?
Can it secede unilaterally under international law? If there is a
conflict, which law prevails?
</P>
<P>
   In the only portions of their opinion that seemed unequivocal,
the justices ruled that neither the Canadian constitution nor
international law gives Quebec the right to unilateral secession.
</P>
<P>
   However, for the first time, the Supreme Court ruled that Quebec
has a right to negotiate a departure if its people give
``unambiguous expression...that they no longer wish to remain in
Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   In the view of some analysts, the Canadian government opened a
Pandora's box by going to the high court instead of sticking to the
political arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking this issue to the Supreme Court is one of the most
foolish decisions ever made by the federal government in the
history of this country,'' former British Columbia Premier Dave
Barrett told the CBC.

 &HT;    Commentary: The price of forfeiting privacy
 &HT;    (EDS: Embargoed until Saturday, Aug. 22, 1998.)
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do journalists have dilemmas about revealing scandalous matters
relating to politicians' personal lives? Do they ever think about
the pain and hurt such revelations will cause spouses and children?
The answer is yes _ even in today's voyeuristic culture.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, I can tell about a story I didn't write. No need
for reservations now because it's public knowledge. It relates to
the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Colorado Gov.
Roy Romer, married with seven children.
</P>
<P>
   Romer's in the uncomfortable position of being called on to
comment in national forums about the Clinton-Lewinsky matter.
Uncomfortable because a short time ago, an anonymous political
enemy released a video of him in a long embrace with his former
chief of staff, B.J. Thornberry, in a car at a Washington airport
and later at her home.
</P>
<P>
   I ran into Romer and Thornberry in a most unusual setting three
years ago, one that raised questions that I might have pursued or
tipped off some Colorado media friends to pursue. I didn't, mainly
because I couldn't find any public-interest reason to do so, though
I knew from living in Colorado (and serving in the Colorado Senate
for eight years) of rumors about the two.
</P>
<P>
   My 25-year-old son, John, and I were backpacking on the
Appalachian Trail in May 1995 _ Memorial Day weekend, a rainy,
nasty one for hiking or sight-seeing in Virginia's Thomas Jefferson
National Forest. Near the end of our 80-mile adventure, John and I
crossed the Skyline Drive near Rockfish Gap, one of the vistas that
Jefferson called America's most magnificent.
</P>
<P>
   As we bemoaned civilization's interference with the trail, a car
pulled up to the stop sign where we stood. To my astonishment, the
driver was Romer. I waved my red rain jacket, and he rolled down
the window. John and I greeted him excitedly. The governor seemed
less excited to see us. In the car with him was a woman, not his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``You remember B.J.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed I did. I remembered too the rumors about the governor's
relationship with Thornberry, which circulated primarily in the
underground press and were only picked up by the mainstream media
prior to Romer's first re-election campaign in 1992. At that time
Romer nipped the rumor in the bud in his straightforward, farm-boy
style. At a state Democratic convention, with Thornberry on one
side and his wife on the other, he praised Thornberry's service to
the state and said ``how dare you'' to the media for insulting her.
The scenario elicited a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   But on that May morning in Virginia, the governor was less
artful. He looked through the thick fog that shrouded his car and
us, and explained that he just been showing Thornberry ``this
beautiful Skyline Drive.'' He went on to add that he'd come to
Virginia to check out some of the John Deere stores he owns.
</P>
<P>
   Two years went by before the Romer-Thornberry relationship
surfaced again in the media. When the dirty-tricks video was
released, Romer, again with his wife beside him, held one news
conference, saying that he had ``an affectionate relationship''
with Thornberry and that his family was well aware of it. He made
no apologies, and he never answered another question about it.
</P>
<P>
   There was a short-lived flurry of stories in the Colorado media
that barely made the news wires elsewhere, even though Romer, by
that time, was the national Democratic Party chairman. Though his
``affectionate'' line makes little sense to anyone, he used it
again last week when Jeff Greenfield asked him about the
relationship on a national CNN ``town meeting.'' It was,
ironically, a session in which various leaders discussed whether
politicians should be held to higher moral standards than others.
</P>
<P>
   I watched, uncomfortable that the man I had met on Skyline Drive
chose to comment on the Clinton situation. The conflict gnawed
then. It does still.
</P>
<P>
   Here was a governor who had been a good one. Here was a family
with a loving wife and mother and seven nice children. Should all
privacy be forfeited and his family pay the price? I didn't think
so then, and I don't now.Martha Ezzard is a member of the Atlanta
Journal editorial board. Her column appears Saturdays and Mondays.

IN NEW YORK CITY, TRAWLING THE FRINGE'S WILD TERRAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hugh Hysell was determined to crack this fringe
thing. Having been wait-listed by the organizers of the New York
International Fringe Festival with a not-very-novel idea, a revival
of ``The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me,'' the aspiring Manhattan
director racked his brain for a project that might be more in tune
with the festival's ebullient spirit, its mandate to, above all
else, make it new.
</P>
<P>
   With the submission deadline looming, it came to him: why not,
in the classic-twisting age of ``Shakespeare's R &AMP; J,'' create an
all-male version of ``The Importance of Being Earnest''? Half-Moon
Street could become Chelsea; Woolton, the Hamptons. Cecily could be
morphed into Kurt, Gwendolyn into Gerald and Miss Prism
de-feminized with a simple''
</P>
<P>
   ``I downloaded the play off the Internet, made a number of cuts,
and it all made sense: the pretensions in the gay culture, the
cattiness,'' Hysell said. ``I wrote my proposal, said, `How about
an alternative to my alternative?' and they said, `OK, you're in
the festival.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Voila! Another New York theater adventure typed out and played
out under deadline. The results of this and many other such
backstage dramas _ 143 others, to be exact _ are yours for the
sampling in the funky, flexible, artistically free-form spaces of
the Lower East Side, where the sophomore year of the New York
International Fringe Festival is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Operating virtually around-the-clock through Aug. 30, the
festival, which began on Wednesday, has with uncanny swiftness put
its stamp on late-summer theatergoing in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Gathering little-known theater companies from around the world
for 12 days, the event is evolving into a kind of Olympics of
performance art, an oasis invigorated by the boundless energy of an
eclectic band of writers and actors in the normally parched weeks
before Labor Day, when the theater season just begins to rev up.
</P>
<P>
   The festival could be the season's jumper cables. And there may
be no more appropriate way to absorb the electric optimism of a
season on the brink than spending a day or two with the players who
hope to represent the art form's future.
</P>
<P>
   The event is come-as-you-are and see-what-you-want. At any given
time, the curtain may be rising simultaneously on seven or eight
shows in the festival's more than a dozen spaces (not including the
free outdoor shows of the adjunct Fringe Al Fresco).
</P>
<P>
   Consult the festival's indispensable 40-page program and map out
a strategy: Let's see, there's ``Tales of a Bugged-Out Black
Chick'' at noon, ``Women of James Bond'' at 2, ``Alice's Evidence''
at 7, ``Lola Montez in Bavaria'' at 9:30 ... and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Hang out at what is called Fringe Central, the Theatorium on
Stanton Street, and trade playgoing tips with the young people
sipping coffee at the entrance, or wander over to the Kraine
Theater on East Fourth, Surf Reality on Allen or the House of
Candles on Stanton and poll departing theatergoers.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can stop by the Allen Street Mall, where Michael
Krynski's hallucinatory sculptures of giant twigs protruding from
pairs of slacks are on display throughout the festival.
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to roam, bring a water bottle, but leave your lofty
expectations at home. Be prepared to sit on unpadded seats,
perspire or freeze a bit _ the air-conditioning in these spaces is
spotty _ and fill in the dramaturgical blanks because a lot of what
you'll see is embryonic, performed on minuscule budgets with
minimal scenery, the gotta-run sort that folds up into suitcases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 30 minutes between shows, and the show before you
has 15 minutes to get out when they're done,'' Hysell said of the
round-robin performance schedule, a typical show running six or
seven times during the festival. ``We have seven minutes to load
in, but it's pretty simple: four wooden folding chairs, a table,
four picture frames and a piece of purple fabric.''
</P>
<P>
   Hysell, who worked as associate manager of the Off Broadway show
``Tap Dogs'' and will serve in a similar capacity with a revival of
``The Mystery of Irma Vep'' beginning in September at the Westside
Theater, is not enduring the rigors of the Theater of Masking Tape
as a creative way to kill time.
</P>
<P>
   He has a fantasy that some influential audience member, some
agent or producer, might make his show a star. The template for his
fancy was set down by the success of ``Gross Indecency,'' however
unlikely that may be. The hit play about the libel and lewdness
trials of Oscar Wilde has run for more than a year, and is soon to
close, at the Minetta Lane Theater in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   Though this well-constructed play was not part of the festival,
its Off Off Broadway origins, which share roots with many of the
fringe's offerings, have made its triumph an exemplar. ``The cool
thing to have happen,'' Hysell said, ``would be a transfer like
`Gross Indecency,' or even to get published.''
</P>
<P>
   Short of discovery, the pleasure for the participants is the
total immersion. ``For 12 days the theater is an ideal environment;
it's like theater camp,'' said Diane Paulus who, with Aaron Beall
and John Clancy, is a co-artistic director for the festival. ``It's
a community-based, no-frills, risk-taking venture.''
</P>
<P>
   Beall, the artistic director of Todo Con Nada, a mini-empire of
spaces on Ludlow and Stanton Streets, said the fringe is intended
as a mere slice of downtown's teeming theatrical life. ``It's a
Polaroid of what goes on all year round,'' he explained. ``And it's
a celebration of what's going on.''
</P>

   The second New York Fringe Festival is a slightly pared-down
version of the first, which organizers say drew about 25,000
playgoers and presented 175 plays and performance pieces. The event
can expand or contract, they say, based on the quality and
diversity of the projects they review.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the members of the triumvirate each pored over 450
submissions _ the proposal letter being the most important document
they evaluated _ and whittled the list to the chosen 144.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the NFL draft,'' Beall said.
</P>
<P>
   It is, however, a particularly New York refashioning of the
fringe concept, pioneered by the granddaddy of the fringe
festivals, in Edinburgh, and largely duplicated in a string of
popular fringe festivals across Canada, from Edmonton to Toronto to
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the main event, there are fringelets in
``FringeJR,'' an assortment of children's arts and crafts workshops
and other daily events at the Connelly Theater on East Fourth
Street, and in Fringe Al Fresco, which includes ``Frozen Fringe,''
an outdoor ice show in Seward Park, at the corner of Essex Street
and East Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another major New York departure from the older fringes is the
selectivity. Nancy Webster, the producer of the Toronto Fringe, one
of Canada's best-known festivals, said the local participants, who
make up 75 percent of the Toronto offerings, are selected by
lottery, a process which she says insures that the event is
accessible to anyone who wants to produce a show.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Webster explained that the Canadian Association of Fringe
Festivals considered the nonjuried aspect such a vital ingredient,
along with a tradition of giving all box-office receipts to the
participants, that it had politely suggested to the New York
festival that it not label itself as ``fringe.''
</P>
<P>
   (The New York Fringe Festival, its organizers say, returns $7 of
every $11 ticket to the individual shows; $3 goes into the coffers
for the next year's festival and $1 into a pool for the theater
spaces.)
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wonderful about the fringe in Canada is that somebody
straight out of school, they'll do this, and they have this
audience that will see them,'' Ms. Webster said.
</P>
<P>
   The differences are of a philosophical, rather than overtly
confrontational, variety. The New York organizers contended that
because of the greater volume of theater produced at every level
here than anywhere else, it was essential to impose some
restrictions, however loose, on what is to be offered. ``New York
City is 365 days a year of unadjudicated fringe festival,'' Ms.
Paulus argued. What need is there, she added, for more of that?
</P>
<P>
   Reading the guide to the New York festival, it's extremely
difficult to divine any sense of limit, what with shows with titles
like ``So, I Killed a Few People'' by the Annoyance Theater of
Chicago, or ``Something Something Uber Alles'' by the Purgatorio
Ink Theater of New York. In fact, judging from the experience last
August, the fringe program is anything but a scientific how-to
manual for the best of the fringe.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to predict which shows will be worth your time.
The joy of the festival is that it is all a matter of individual
initiative. This year's fringe looks to be knee-deep in the
classics reclassified, a indication of how many of the participants
are fresh out of acting programs.
</P>
<P>
   Among the shows: ``Three Sisters in Search of a Cherry
Orchard,'' ``Antigone Through Time,'' a 24-hour version of ``The
Bald Soprano,'' ``Medeamaterial,'' ``Lizzie Borden's `Tempest'''
and ``The Prometheus Excerpts.'' One-man (and woman) stands like
``Once Vaudeville,'' Kevin Augustine's adult puppet show;
improvisation groups, and even a conventional play or two are among
the offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Some attractions will be draws on the strength of favorable
reputation, like the plays honoring the centennial of Brecht's
birth, or by dint of outrageousness: ``Synchronized Swimming _ The
Dry Version,'' from Switzerland, just sounds too wild to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   The expectation of watching gymnastic imaginations giving their
craziest notions a total workout is what can make a fringe festival
something to look forward to. The fearlessness of these endeavors
brings to mind an intrepid expedition of climbers setting off even
when they hear the distant rumbling of an avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fringe would be the only place where I could explore
something like this, at the level I'm at now,'' said Linda Key, one
of the directors of ``Clowning the Bard,'' a 75-minute, new
vaudeville-style show that rejiggers every play (plus a sonnet) by
Shakespeare for a 16-member clown troupe. Audiences will be asked
to try to figure out which piece is based on which play.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was so ambitious that Ms. Key, the artistic director of
Six Figures Theater Company, was in rehearsal with the production
before she realized that one of the plays had been forgotten.
Appropriately enough, it was ``Love's Labor's Lost.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting the order right has been a bear, but we're ready,''
Ms. Key said. ``It's what the fringe is about: the only place in
New York where they give you a theater and let you do something
like this.'' &QL; 
 &QL;

JOURNAL REPORTER WHO COVERED BARNICLE STORY   LEAVES PAPER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Mike Barnicle saga _ and the heightened
journalistic scrutiny and self-examination in this summer of media
mea culpas _ may have claimed another victim. James S. Hirsch, a
three-year veteran of The Wall Street Journal's Boston bureau, left
the newspaper this week after a problem surfaced in his Aug. 12
story on the previous day's decision by The Boston Globe to suspend
Barnicle for two months rather than terminate him.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Barnicle resigned from the Globe after new
questions about his credibility arose and he was unable to verify
the reporting behind an Oct. 8, 1995, column.
</P>
<P>
   In his Aug. 12 story, Hirsch wrote that the Globe's owner, The
New York Times Co., ``declined to comment'' on the decision to
suspend Barnicle.
</P>
<P>
   But the Journal subsequently published a correction stating that
``the Times had not been called for comment on the article.'' The
Times' official position was: ``We support the Globe's right to
make its own decision.'' After the Aug. 12 story, the Times pointed
out the error in a letter to the Journal's managing editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Hirsch knowingly printed an untruth, which we take very
seriously,'' said Journal spokeswoman Karen Miller Pensiero. ``It
violated our compact with our readers. We considered all of the
circumstances and the reporter was disciplined.'' The company also
confirmed that Hirsch no longer worked at the Journal, but would
not comment on the particulars of his leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch also declined to comment on the circumstances of his
departure.
</P>
<P>
   In his nine-year career at the Journal, Hirsch built a
reputation as a sharp and solid newsman among his peers. Besides
covering the Barnicle travails, he wrote a notable front-page story
in late May detailing the financial problems besetting Fidelity
Investments' Community Newspaper Company.

HONDA, EXPANDING GLOBALLY, CITES 26 PERCENT RISE IN PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Honda Motor Co. is benefiting more than ever from its
global reach, a distinction once ridiculed by domestically focused
competitors in Japan's automotive industry.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the domestic market shrinking rapidly, Japan's No. 3
automaker (behind Toyota and Nissan) reported a 26 percent profit
gain Thursday for the latest quarter, largely because of sales in
Europe and in Honda's largest market, the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended June 30, Honda reported net income of a
record 78.22 billion yen, or $547 million, on a 17.4 percent sales
increase of 1.6 trillion yen, or $11 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas sales once earned Honda criticism, much the same way
that Sony's vast international sales once led industry titans here
to dismiss it as ``not really a Japanese company.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, with almost every Japanese business executive
praising the benefits of globalization, Honda's pioneering spirit
is admired.
</P>
<P>
   Its new president, Hiroyuki Yoshino, says he believes the reach
that Honda has already established will protect it from the forces
of consolidation sweeping the global automobile business.
</P>
<P>
   With Daimler buying Chrysler, Volkswagen buying Rolls Royce and
BMW clearly looking to expand, the Japanese automakers seem like
attractive potential partners with their dominance of Japan's huge
car market and deep penetration in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But Yoshino says he is convinced the Japanese automakers can
hold their own. ``The way I look at Daimler and Chrysler is:
Chrysler is really only in North America, Benz has only a small
presence there,'' he said in an interview earlier this month.
``They didn't have a global strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Honda makes more than 100 products in 40 countries. ``Honda's
global strategy has been established, and I think it is top rate,''
Yoshino said. ``We build our cars in North America, Asia and Europe
_ we're already there.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yoshino also has a novel way of looking at Honda's spot in the
global hierarchy of car manufacturers. Annually, Honda sells about
5 million motorcycles and 3 million pieces of power equipment, he
points out, in addition to 2.3 million cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even GM sells only 9 million units a year, and Toyota sells
only 5 million,'' he said, only half in jest. ``If you look at it
on a unit basis, we're outselling them.''
</P>
<P>
   That may sound arrogant. But Honda has needed a strong sense of
itself just to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Honda is not a member of a kei-retsu, the powerful business
agglomerations built around banks that have until recently provided
endless amounts of credit regardless of borrower quality.
</P>
<P>
   Honda has been more reliant on shareholders and the capital
markets for financing, and it has done a good job of making them
happy. ``It's one of the most transparent companies in Japan,''
said Noriaki Hirakata, an automotive analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   An example of the company's honest appraisal of its performance
came a few months ago when Honda reported a small increase in June
domestic sales. Rather than portraying the increase as a sign of
strength, Yoshino explained that it was largely because of a change
in the way that Accord station wagons were counted. Domestically
sold Accord wagons produced elsewhere _ and thus not counted in the
1997 numbers _ were now produced in Japan and counted in the 1998
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to give too much of an impression of success,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hirakata at Morgan Stanley and others have some concerns about
Honda. One is whether the automaker may run out of production
capacity for cars. Another is whether it can continue to make money
pursuing the ``small is smart'' strategy it has pursued in the
domestic market.
</P>
<P>
   Honda, like other auto manufacturers, has had more luck selling
mini-cars in the Japanese market, where the specter of rising
unemployment, a shaky financial system and a virtually nonexistent
social safety net are among the worries keeping consumers from
showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the company will start selling newly designed
mini-cars, and Yoshino said he was confident they would help
Honda's second-half performance. He said Honda must rely on smaller
cars to sustain its performance in Japan, since an economic
turnaround was unlikely any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller cars, however, typically provide smaller profit margins.
Yoshino said he was not worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made profit on the mini-cars that we've been selling so
far, and profits from the ones we start selling in October should
be higher,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for capacity constraints, Yoshino said he could understand
the worries. But he was uneasy about the United States market,
where Honda will introduce a redesigned Acura later this year, and
said he was reluctant to commit more capital to production lines at
this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that concern in the back of my head, what we'll do is
stick to our current production capacity,'' he said, adding that
the company could compensate for some capacity limitations by
purchasing employees' paid vacation time so they could keep
working.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshino also noted that Honda had a second North American line
opening in Canada, where it would produce mini-vans.
</P>
<P>
   On the home front, Honda's nemesis, Toyota Motor Corp., has also
thrown down a challenge. Toyota, Japan's largest automaker, is
worried about the unpopularity of its cars among younger people and
has vowed to woo that demographic group, which is Honda's main
customer base.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshino conceded that Toyota was a threat, but said he was not
intimidated. ``One reason we attract younger people is the
motorcycle business and our reputation in it,'' he said. ``We also
are back in Formula One racing, which helps, too.''
</P>
<P>
   His predecessor, Nobuhiko Kawamoto, took Honda out of that
business in 1992 but put it back in this spring, announcing plans
to return to Formula One racing in 2000.

   Yoshino conceded that Toyota's stodgy image had been helped by
its hybrid ``clean'' car, Prius, which uses an electric battery and
gasoline engine and is far lower in emissions than a regular car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am gritting my teeth a bit,'' Yoshino said of the flood of
good press Toyota has enjoyed from Prius. ``But I'd say their
technical expertise with that car is not so great.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his opinion about Toyota's technical expertise, he's
not repeating Kawamoto's bold suggestion that Honda, which produces
fewer than half the cars Toyota does, could overtake Toyota as
Japan's No. 1 car maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bigger is not always better,'' he said. ``If everything else
stays the same, then bigger is better. But things rarely stay the
same.''

COURT SAYS SECESSION BY QUEBEC POSSIBLE, BUT DIFFICULT AND COSTLY  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY DePALMA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A simple vote in Quebec is not enough to allow the
French-speaking province to legally separate from the rest of
Canada, the country's Supreme Court said Thursday in a landmark
opinion widely seen as fortifying the federal government's efforts
to keep the United States' closest ally from breaking up.
</P>
<P>
   However, the unanimous opinion by the nine justices of Canada's
highest court does not go so far as to declare Canada indivisible.
If a clear majority of the people in Quebec wants to secede, the
justices said, the rest of Canada would be obliged to negotiate the
terms of secession as though it were an amendment to the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   But the nine justices, three of them from Quebec, including
chief Justice Antonio Lamer, made it clear that separation would be
difficult, painful and costly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devil would be in the details,'' the justices wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court also found that there is no right to
unilateral secession in international law except for colonies and
oppressed people, which it said does not apply to Quebec. If the
province tried to secede outside Canada's constitutional framework,
the court warned, the international community would likely reject
the action as illegitimate.
</P>
<P>
   This is believed to be the first time a democratic country has
ever tested the legal terms of its own dissolution and the Canadian
court's ruling is expected to have an impact on other countries
struggling with similar issues of self-determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe this finding will encourage those who look
for more self-determination to continue a solely legal
administrative solution,'' said Wolfgang Danspeckgruber, director
of the Liechtenstein Program on Self-determination at Princeton
University. He said the judgment in Canada will be seen in places
like Kosovo, East Timor and other places seeking independence as
proof that ``if you really want to do it, it may be necessary to do
it in a much more radical way'' than the law permits.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government of Canada asked the court for an advisory
opinion on several aspects of Quebec separation in September- 1996,
hoping that by clearly setting the terms of separation, it would
discourage the Quebecois from voting for it.
</P>
<P>
   Quebec refused to participate in the case, and was represented
by a court-appointed lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In Quebec, separatist leaders were angered by the court's
opinion and said the will of the Quebec people, the vast majority
of whom speak French, could not be overruled by any legal judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Brassard, Quebec's intergovernmental affairs minister,
claimed the court's recognition of Quebec's right to secede as a
clear victory and dismissed the rest of the opinion. ``The people
of Quebec have always had, have now and will continue to have the
inalienable right to decide democratically and without interference
their own future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect the separatists to use resentment against the
court to whip up support for a provincial election that could take
place late this year or early next year. They have promised to hold
a new referendum _ the third _ on independence after the election.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the country welcomed the historic legal opinion.
``When the next referendum rolls around, they'll trot out this rule
of law and hammer the soft sovereignty vote on the head with it,''
said David Schneiderman, executive director of the Center for
Constitutional Studies at the University of Alberta in Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians in Western Canada have long pressed the federal
government to clarify the rules for separation and demanded that
the rest of Canada be involved in any decision about Quebec's
future.
</P>
<P>
   Preston Manning, a westerner who leads the Parliamentary
opposition, said the court's opinion steps up the pressure on Prime
Minister Jean Chretien. ``The ball is in the prime minister's
court, and we're calling on him to start negotiating a new federal
provincial partnership which includes the province of Quebec,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In delivering its opinion on what it called ``momentous
questions that go to the heart of our system of constitutional
government,'' the high court made it clear that Quebec cannot, on
its own, legally separate. But the justices did not close the door
entirely on another referendum about Quebec's possible
independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``A clear majority vote in Quebec on a clear question in favor
of secession would confer democratic legitimacy on the secession
initiative which all of the other participants in Confederation
would have to recognize,'' the Supreme Court's judgment said.
</P>
<P>
   The justices said such a vote in favor of secession would have
to be treated as an initiative by Quebec for a change in Canada's
constitution, and the other provinces would have to enter into
negotiations about the terms of separation.
</P>
<P>
   But the underlying message, which the federal government had
sought when it asked the court to take up the question, was that
separation under any circumstances would be far more costly than
separatist leaders have led voters to believe.

<P>
   ``Negotiations following such a referendum would undoubtedly be
difficult. While negotiators would have to contemplate the
possibility of secession, there would be no absolute entitlement to
it and no assumption that an agreement reconciling all relevant
rights and obligations would actually be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is foreseeable that even negotiations carried out in
conformity with the underlying constitutional principles could
reach an impasse. We need not speculate here as to what would then
transpire,'' the opinion said.
</P>
<P>
   Questioning the legality of Quebec's 30-year-fight for
independence was a risky strategy for the federal government
because any backlash against it in Quebec could make the separatist
government of Premier Lucien Bouchard even more popular.
</P>
<P>
   But federal officials, shaken by the near victory of the
separatists in the October 1995 referendum on separation, had
decided it was far more risky to just sit back and do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Since the separatist movement began in Quebec in the 1960s, the
sentiment for breaking up Canada appeared to gain momentum. In the
first referendum on independence, in May 1980, the separatists
gained 40 percent of the votes cast in Quebec, the only province
where the referendum was held.
</P>
<P>
   In the October 1995 referendum, Quebec's vote in favor of
separation had increased to just over 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials claim that separatists who have controlled the
Quebec government for most of the last 20 years misled voters into
thinking that separation would be quick and relatively easy.
According to published reports, separatist leaders planned to
declare independence and gain recognition of the new country from
France and the United States within days after the 1995 referendum
if they had won, despite promises of a period of negotiation with
the rest of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have said it is unlikely the United States
would have recognized an independent Quebec that seceded without
the consent of the rest of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The Ottawa government decided in 1996 to join a suit filed by a
federalist in Quebec asking the Supreme Court for an opinion on the
constitutional legality of a unilateral Quebec secession.
</P>
<P>
   Such opinions are called references and while not legally
binding, they are important because of the moral and legal
authority of the court. The Supreme Court has issued 74 references
since 1892.
</P>
<P>
   The court limited its opinion strictly to the questions asked by
the federal government and did not touch several other sensitive
issues. For example, it left up to politicians to decide whether
``a clear majority'' meant 51 percent of votes cast or some more
rigorous standard.
</P>
<P>
   The court also avoided the question of whether a Quebec that
decides to leave Canada could then be partitioned because northern
Indian tribes, like the Cree, have said firmly that they want to
remain in Canada.

   NEW YORK _ Open positions of short sales on the New York Stock
Exchange declined slightly last month, to 4.1 billion shares last
Friday, the exchange reported Thursday. The decrease of 28.7
million shares in open short positions, less than 1 percent, was
the first monthly decline since January.
</P>
<P>
   The latest short-interest figure was equal to 1 percent of all
shares listed on the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
   On the smaller American Stock Exchange, short interest rose 3.2
percent last month, to 200.5 million shares, a new monthly record.
</P>
<P>
   A short position is created when an investor sells shares that
have been borrowed. If the share price falls, the investor can
profit by buying shares at a lower price to replace the borrowed
ones.
</P>
<P>
   An increase in the short position in a company's shares may
indicate a rise in bearish sentiments among investors toward that
company. But a short position in a company's shares can also
increase because of complex trading strategies, especially those
related to arbitrage in takeover deals.

BARNES &AMP; NOBLE PLANS STOCK OFFERING IN ONLINE UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With competition intensifying among electronic booksellers,
Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc. announced Thursday that it would sell shares to
the public of its money-losing online venture, which trails in
sales behind the pioneering leader, Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble, the nation's largest bookstore chain, intends to
sell 20 percent of the online venture, Barnesandnoble.com, which
generated $14 million in sales last year in contrast to Amazon's
$147.8 million. The initial public offering could take place in the
next 30 days, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're using the IPO to televise that they have online
capability and secondly to enrich the value of Barnes &AMP; Noble
stock, which is going to retain 80 percent'' of the online venture,
said Linda Killian, portfolio manager for Renaissance Capital Corp.
in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Barnes &AMP; Noble rose 7.5 percent Thursday, or $2.8125,
to $40.0625, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. While the
overall stock market has recently slumped, some new issues of
Web-based businesses, like Geocities, have risen sharply.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Barnes &AMP; Noble announced its plans for a public
offering, the company said that its loss for the second quarter
tripled, primarily because of a $23 million loss from the online
venture. Barnes &AMP; Noble reported a loss of $5.7 million, or 8 cents
a share fully diluted, compared with a loss of $1.37 million, or 2
cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 9.3
percent, to $675 million. The results were in line with Wall Street
analysts' forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Security and Exchange Commission restrictions, Mary Ellen
Keating, a spokeswoman for Barnes &AMP; Noble in New York, declined to
answer questions about why the company intends to make the offering
or how the proceeds would be used.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, when a company spins off a division, it could mean
that the unit's executives will get more independence and stock
option incentives that give them more of a stake in the company,
Ms. Killian of Renaissance Capital said. ``It would make them more
competitive with Amazon.com,'' she said. ``You just have to bear in
mind that management of this company has its roots in bricks and
mortar.''
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, Barnes &AMP; Noble hired several top executives
for the online venture, including a new chief financial officer,
and two vice-presidents in marketing and international strategies.
One of the new executives, John Rindlaub Jr. comes with marketing
experience from Shoplink Inc., a PC-based grocery shopping and home
delivery company. The chief executive of the online venture will
remain Stephen Riggio, the vice chairman of Barnes &AMP; Noble, whose
roots are in traditional book selling.
</P>
<P>
   The number of users of the company's Web site
(www.barnesandnoble.com) has continued to grow, with 720,000
customers by early August, compared with 500,000 last May. These
gains come as the company redesigned its Web site to offer
one-click ordering. The online division is also preparing to
introduce a new advertising campaign in the fall with a projected
1998 advertising budget of $35 million to $40 million. The New York
office of TBWA Chiat/Day was named last month to handle the
account.
</P>
<P>
   But the competition among online bookstores could intensify with
the entry of the German media conglomerate, Bertelsmann AG, which
is expected to open its online store, Booksonline, in Europe and
the United States in the fall. The Borders Group Inc. started its
online bookstore earlier this year although the second-largest
bookstore retailer has been concentrating more on overseas
expansion with the opening of conventional bookstores in London and
Singapore.

 TEXAS LAWMAKERS RALLY BEHIND CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas lawmakers rallied behind President Clinton's
decision Thursday to bomb suspected terrorist camps in Afghanistan
and a chemical plant in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has an absolute duty to attack terrorism
where it lives and breeds, in order to prevent future attacks on
American citizens around the world,'' said House Majority Leader
Dick Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people stand united in the face of terrorism. The
men and women who undertook this mission deserve our praise and
prayers,'' Armey added.
</P>
<P>
   The military strikes came nearly three days after President
Clinton testified before a federal grand jury here and later
publicly acknowledged a relationship with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky that he said was ``not appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. William ``Mac'' Thornberry, R-Texas, asked about the timing
of the attack, said he would like to see more evidence about why it
was launched Thursday. ``I think a lot of us are interested in
knowing more about the evidence,'' Thornberry said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he added: ``I've got to assume that any president would
only risk the lives of U.S. soldiers for the right reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornberry said that ``it is very important for the United
States to speak with one voice against terrorism... I do think that
once we know who committed a terrorist attack, we've got to strike
hard against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said he was ``highly supportive of our
military strikes today in Afghanistan and Sudan.'' He added, ``If
we have credible information that these are the responsible
parties, which it seems our intelligence agencies have provided,
these bombings are absolutely justified.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nicholas V. Lampson, D-Texas, also supported the
president's action. He said he was ``proud that the United States
acted swiftly, decisively, and appropriately in response to recent
acts of senseless terrorism in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine looking into the eyes of a mother of one of
the 12 Americans who were sent home in caskets last week and
telling her that no response is necessary,'' Lampson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lampson said he hopes the bombing ``will send a clear message to
terrorists in Afghanistan, Sudan and other parts of the world that
the United States will not be blackmailed.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ The dozens of journalists eager for a sight
of President Clinton on his summer vacation got their chance
Thursday afternoon, when the president strode into the makeshift
press center at Edgartown Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   There, he announced to the world that the US had launched
strikes against Afghanistan and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Just as quickly, he was gone, his motorcade rushing off to
Martha's Vineyard Airport for an Air Force One flight back to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had been keeping a low profile since arriving here
Tuesday, a day after he acknowledged a relationship that was ``not
appropriate'' with a former White House intern in grand jury
testimony and nationally televised address.
</P>
<P>
   Before Thursday, Clinton had only been seen once. Photographers
captured him walking his chocolate Labrador retriever, Buddy, on
Boston businessman Richard Friedman's Edgartown estate, where
Clinton, First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and their daughter
Chelsea are staying.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's entrance into the press center was a dramatic moment
in an afternoon that was surreal. Before he arrived, so-called pool
reporters _ assigned to follow the president's moves and report
back to other journalists _ lounged under a tent on the grounds of
the estate. The speculation was whether Clinton might play golf on
such a perfect day.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, they were watching a videotape of the movie ``Wag
the Dog,'' about a president who creates a foreign policy crisis to
distract attention from a sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back at the press center, McCurry began his daily
briefing with reporters hungry for news. ``What meager scraps would
you like to start with first?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he offered some details about a small birthday party held
Wednesday night for Clinton, who turned 52, at the rented Chilmark
farm home of his longtime friend, Washington power broker Vernon E.
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a very quiet, simple dinner with Vernon, his family,
Vernon's daughter and her family came for dessert,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it was very low-key. They had coconut cake from a local
bakery here. They had barbecued chicken raised on that very farm
and island corn,'' he said. He then added, ``They did candles on
the cake and sang to the president, `Happy Birthday.' Isn't that
sweet?''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said dinner guest collectively gave Clinton a wool
sweater made from a sheep on the farm that Jordan is renting.
</P>
<P>
   As he was being peppered with questions about Lewinsky's second
appearance Thursday before a grand jury, McCurry was handed a note
that interrupted the questions. ``I need to do a very important
piece of business,'' he said. ``In about 10 minutes, the president
will be here.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Aug. 20 -- Within minutes of President Clinton's
announcement of the attacks against terrorists, U.S. Sen Arlen
Specter openly questioned the president's motive for launching the
bombings, becoming one of the first lawmakers to raise the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those questions will be raised around the world,'' Specter,
R-Pa., said at a hastily arranged press conference in Philadelphia,
broadcast around the world on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said he wanted the White House and Pentagon to explain
``especially the reason for doing it now,'' alluding to the
president's swirling controversy regarding his admission of an
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Murtha, D-Johnstown, the top Democrat on the House
defense appropriations subcommittee, was returning Thursday from a
fact-finding trip in Saudi Arabia, which sits across the Red Sea
from Sudan, the site of one of the two bombings on alleged
terrorist compounds. Murtha, however, could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., in prepared remarks, did not raise
the Lewinsky issue. But once Specter and Sen. Daniel Coats, R-Ind.,
a close friend of Santorum's, raised the issue, he also admitted he
had questions about the timing of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to give the benefit of the doubt to this
president,'' said Robert Traynham, Santorum's spokesman, but he
added, ``The senator has a raised eyebrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats and many other Republicans, however, rallied
around the president's decision, including House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, who said, ``It was the right thing to do at the right
time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not assume any other reason (for the strikes) unless I
have evidence,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a senior member of
the Senate Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important to respond to the recent terrorist attacks
and to prevent additional attacks upon American interests,'' said
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   But Specter said there was an issue of whether ``any
diversionary motive was involved'' in the bombing. He noted the
past U.S. responses to attacks like the ones on American embassies
in East Africa were much different.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, President Reagan ordered a bombing run in Tripoli
because of Libyan support for the bombing of a German dance club in
which U.S. soldiers died, but that came after a months-long
investigation, Specter said. And in June 1996, 19 Air Force
soldiers died in a terrorist bombing at their base in Saudi Arabia.
Two years later, no U.S. action has been taken.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, less than two weeks after the bombings in Kenya
and Tanzania killed a dozen Americans and at least 245 Africans,
the Clinton administration said it had sufficient evidence to
launch the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we ought to respond forcefully to terrorism, but we
ought to have evidentiary basis for doing so,'' Specter said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, however, said there was ample
evidence that those compounds were involved in the embassy
bombings, and that they were planning further attacks against
American sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was done in self defense,'' Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright told reporters in the White House briefing room.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The story of Madeleine Albright is enough to make a strong heart
gloomy.
</P>
<P>
   When she became U.S. secretary of state 18 months ago, things
seemed splendid. She was the first woman in the job; she had an
appealing personal story, as a childhood refugee from Hitler and
Stalin; she exuded the charm and fluency so important in the age of
television.
</P>
<P>
   She had more star power than any secretary of state since Henry
Kissinger, a fact especially noticeable because she succeeded
plodding Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these days almost nobody speaks well of her. And this raises
painful questions about America's capacity for leadership.
</P>
<P>
   People said that Mrs. Albright's charm would invigorate foreign
policy. She knew how to get the rest of the administration on her
side. She knew how to persuade voters not to be bored by abroad.
She knew how to coax the chivalrous Southerner out of Jesse Helms,
the usually cantankerous chairman of the Senate foreign-relations
committee.
</P>
<P>
   And she sounded bold. She described America as the
``indispensable nation.'' She said her mindset was formed by Munich
rather than Vietnam, meaning that she would not shrink from using
force against tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, Mrs. Albright's clout within the administration
helped to keep America engaged in Bosnia. But then her clout seemed
to wane.
</P>
<P>
   In May she delivered an ultimatum to Israel: cooperate on a new
peace plan, or America will be rough on you. Israel refused to
cooperate, but Clinton refused to get rough: Mrs. Albright seemed
to have less leverage at the White House than Israel's lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underline this point, the president recently appointed
her rival, Richard Holbrooke, as ambassador to the United Nations:
the word is that the secretary of state was informed rather than
consulted about this.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Albright's reputation for connecting with Middle America
has faded, too. In February, in a college gymnasium in Ohio, she
and two other top administration officials made the case for
containing Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   They failed to win over their audience, and this debacle helps
to explain why America's response to Iraq's current defiance of
U.N. sanctions has so far been mushy.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Albright's courtship of Helms has also delivered less than
had been hoped. It eased the passage of NATO enlargement in the
Senate, and helped get the chemical-weapons treaty through: both
considerable achievements. But Congress still refuses to pay
America's past U.N. dues, and jerks its knee at administration
policies from freeing trade to engaging China.
</P>
<P>
   Because Mrs. Albright has not always won the backing of the
president, voters and Congress, she has failed to deliver on her
bold rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   She promised a Munich mind-set; but NATO still shrinks from
deterring Serbian attacks on Kosovo. She promised that the
indispensable nation would make its influence felt; but Israel has
shown it can dispense with her advice quite cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when Mrs. Albright promises that the terrorists who blew up
American embassies in Africa will be found and punished,
Washington's commentariat raises its eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   What to make of this humiliation? Some say it shows that charm
and sound bites are no substitute for geopolitical grasp, or
(depending on the critic's point of view) for attention to detail.
</P>
<P>
   This is unfair. Mrs. Albright, a former academic, grasps
geopolitics as well as the next wonk; and she has deputies to worry
about detail.
</P>
<P>
   Others suggest that Mrs. Albright has been undermined by a
president who thinks about scandals more than foreign policy. But
Clinton has actually made foreign policy a feature of his second
term, so this is not the whole answer.
</P>
<P>
   The better explanation for Mrs. Albright's comedown lies not in
scandals or in her personal failings, but in the nature of her job.
Hence the painful possibility that whoever comes next will also
have trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Cold War, America's foreign ministers have
been in a bind. If they speak in vague and cautious tones, their
countrymen will be confirmed in their suspicion that foreign policy
is a hopeless muddle and may anyway no longer matter.
</P>
<P>
   This is what happened in Clinton's first term: Christopher was
grey, so Congress slashed the foreign-policy budget and other bits
of the administration grabbed juicy issues (Japan policy was run
first by the trade negotiators and then by the Pentagon).
</P>
<P>
   If foreign ministers speak boldly, on the other hand, they may
fall into Mrs. Albright's trap. They will command admiring
attention for a while. But they may fail to deliver on their bold
words, in which case humiliation will follow.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is a general problem of America's divided
government: each power center is tempted to proclaim a vision in
order to stay ahead of its rivals, but at the same time the
division of power tends to block the action needed to deliver on
the vision.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the problem is especially acute in foreign policy. For one
thing, the temptation to proclaim vision is uncommonly powerful:
you can get away with vision-free steadiness on transport policy,
but if you propose to risk soldiers' lives you need a
grand-sounding reason.
</P>
<P>
   For another, the task of living up to a vision is uncommonly
tough. Unlike roads, the myriad trouble spots of the post-Cold-War
world do not lie quietly there while you wonder how to fix them.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean that the predicament of America's secretary of
state is hopeless? No: just difficult. It is possible, after all,
to imagine a set of conditions under which Mrs. Albright might have
fared better.
</P>
<P>
   If she had enjoyed a stronger personal relationship with
Clinton, she might have avoided the boomerang ultimatum to Israel.
If she had chosen a friendlier setting than a gym full of students,
she might have avoided the public relations debacle on what to do
about Saddam Hussein. If Clinton had been undistracted by scandal,
he might have backed her more vigorously in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the next secretary of state will succeed famously;
perhaps this one, as she probably deserves, will recover from her
woes. Alas, the odds are daunting. &QL;

 &HT;    Class at university tackles question: Which came first _ bread
or beer?
 &HT;    By Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Bread or beer? Barley v. grapes? Nutrition or
libation? These are some of the questions that University of
Georgia students will be discussing this fall in Food Science 2020,
``The Art, Science and History of Beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Taught and designed by Brian Nummer, a brewpub owner and an
adjunct assistant professor in the Department of Food Science, the
one-credit course will introduce students to the role beer and
fermentation have played in world history, culture and religion,
moving from ancient Sumeria, to Europe in the Middle Ages, to
modern microbreweries.
</P>
<P>
   Just as food touches almost every aspect of our lives, so
Nummer's course touches on history, anthropology, agriculture,
transportation, microbiology, sociology and business. It's not
designed for the swill-at-will crowd _ the only tasting will be
imaginary, and one lecture is devoted to the ethics of beer and
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some debate in cultural anthropology as to whether,
when the hunter-gatherers settled down and began cultivating crops,
they first made beer or bread out of barley,'' said Nummer, who
holds a Ph.D. in microbiology from Clemson University. ``I would
say they probably made beer _ home brew is so yeasty that it's full
of vitamins and very nutritious.''
</P>
<P>
   Nummer, 36, has been a student and connoisseur of fermented
froth since he was an undergraduate at Iowa State, where he made
beer _ ``some good, some terrible,'' he confesses _ in his dorm
room. Later, as a graduate student, he trekked through Europe,
stopping in the wine-producing Mozell River town in Germany where
his father's family is from, and realizing ``that if things had
been different, that could have been me there, making wine.''
</P>
<P>
   As it was, he worked for a few years in a food testing lab in
Chicago, where he looked for microbial indicators of food quality.
He left Chicago for Clemson, then came to Athens to work in for the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. When funding for his
particular laboratory work was cut, Nummer moved to Germany and
spent six months brewing beer, then taught at Tennessee Tech for a
few years.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1995, he moved back to Athens. A year later, he opened
the Athens Brewing Company in a two-story cavernous building on
Washington Street. He has been worrying over his wort _ a
nonfermented stage of beer _ ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Six on-site brews _ with names like Oliver Hardy Bitter Ale, for
North Georgia's famous comedian, and Pulitizer Pale Ale, in honor
of prize-winning author Ed Larson, one of Nummer's investors _ are
usually available both in the pub upstairs and the restaurant
downstairs, along with countless other beers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This course offers me a way to keep my hand in teaching, which
I really enjoy,'' said Nummer. ``I made the switch from academics
to business, but there's no guarantee of success, given the
competition. Besides, this lets me make a contribution to the
department.''

SWEDEN'S FROZEN NORTH CAN BE BALMY FOR BUSINESS

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARVIDSJAUR, Sweden _ There is a new item these days in the
display cases of woolen Laplander hats, elk skins and boldly
colored wood carvings in Arvidsjaur's open-air market. Boosters of
this town near the Arctic Circle hope it is a talisman of their
future.
</P>
<P>
   It is a computer mouse pad, made from reindeer hide.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to slow the flight of people from what is already
one of the world's most sparsely settled areas, the Swedish
government is encouraging businesses to set up computerized
telephone-call centers in remote villages like this one and to
staff them with young people who otherwise would be scouting for
work in the population centers to the south.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, as soon as they got an education, it was either
Stockholm or abroad,'' said Barbro Medin-Leven, the regional
development planning director for Norbotten, Sweden's northernmost
county.
</P>
<P>
   Information technology has enabled Swedes to locate here in the
Arctic wilderness businesses that do not need to be close to their
customers.
</P>
<P>
   A resident of Malmo on the south coast calls for a plumber, a
carpenter or a locksmith who may be a block away, and the
transaction is handled here instantly 1,000 miles away. Someone in
Goteborg needs to go to Nigeria and then to Chile. The airline
tickets and hotel reservations are made here in this village, where
Lapps still herd reindeer and live in 200-year-old log cabins.
</P>
<P>
   Sykes, a large call service agency based in Tampa, Fla., has
opened its customer support center for Scandinavia in the small
northern community of Sveg, and in nearby Ljusdal, DHL, the
international air courier company, has placed its hub serving eight
European countries.
</P>
<P>
   The companies benefit from special investment and operating
subsidies that the government provides for enterprises that locate
in the north. And they find that even outlying parts of Sweden have
a supply of educated, keyboard-literate young people with the
Swedes' noted ability to function comfortably in several languages.
</P>
<P>
   Swedes and telephones have a cosy relationship. Sweden has the
highest number of lines per person _ 70 for every 100 inhabitants _
of any country. Forty-four percent of Swedes have mobile phones,
and that number is expected to rise to 60 percent by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   David Hansson, 21, slipped off his headphone on a recent day and
acknowledged that he would have followed all his friends out of
here had it not been for the booking agent's job he landed at Nyman
&AMP; Schultz, Sweden's largest travel service. As he spoke, Asa
Lidstrom, 28, handled a call next to him from a Stockholmer who
needed flight connections to Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, the best thing you could hope for was a job in a
supermarket, and you want something better than that,'' Hansson
said.
</P>
<P>
   There are only 2.4 people per square kilometer up here compared
to an average of 21 per square kilometer in all of Sweden and 144
in Europe. And it is getting roomier all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Forestry is the areas' traditional business, but with the
closing of outdated plants and the mechanization of others, the
number of jobs has declined drastically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to work as an administrator in a sawmill that employed
60 people and cut 20,000 cubic meters a year,'' said Sara
Andersson, director of Arvidsjaur's Office of Trade and Industry.
``Now the figures have switched completely. They cut 60,000 cubic
meters, and there are only 20 employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Arvidsjaur is not an easy sell. The town's 5,000 inhabitants
have to endure winters with temperatures as low as 30 degrees below
zero, six feet of snow on the ground and no sun in the sky for all
but four hours of the day. Ms. Andersson, a native of an even
smaller nearby village called Akkavare, is undaunted, though. ``I
am in the business of marketing the cold, the darkness, the snow
and solitude,'' she said cheerfully.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She has compiled a register of men and women who fled from here
for the south, and she is determined to woo some of them back.
``They're my target audience,'' she said. ``It is dark and cold,
and you have to be brought up here to be comfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   In summertime, the roadsides here blossom with lilacs and purple
fireweed. But Ms. Andersson cultivates Nordic moxie.
</P>
<P>
   She offered a visitor a lunch of air-dried reindeer meat, local
almond potatoes and golden cloudberries for desert and eagerly took
on the question of what's so great about Arvidsjaur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, for one thing, it makes you appreciate how good it is to
step into a warm house,'' she said. ``Also, you see how close we
all live together. You're not alone the way you are in a large
city. All the children here are everybody's children.''
</P>
<P>
   She went on to explain that it is actually not darker here than
in the south because all that snow reflects the light. It is also a
lot easier to get across town. ``I have a sister who lives in
Stockholm, and she can never make it home in time to get to a store
that closes at 7:30,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Arvidsjaur does its best to take advantage of its frigid
winters. It put a nine-hole golf course on two frozen lakes and
supplies colored balls and heavy-duty gloves to players. It has
also created a booming local industry in winter testing facilities
for automobiles, using the frozen lakes and large expanses to
simulate hazardous driving conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50 companies send vehicles and test drivers here. ``What
they need is the extreme cold, and we can guarantee that,'' said
Mats Lundberg, 34, an Arvidsjaur man who was lured back home from
the city of Umea by a job in the business.
</P>
<P>
   Germund Nilsson, area manager of Nyman &AMP; Schultz, said there
were many advantages to doing business in Arvidsjaur. ``It's
cheaper to hire people up here, and they're more loyal because
they're not easily going to cross the street and find another
job,'' he said. ``It's not just being socially conscious,'' he
added, rubbing invisible cash between his thumb and forefinger.
``It's this too.''
</P>
<P>
   Inga-Lill Gustafsson, the reservations manager for Hertz, said
callers liked hearing the broad northern accents of her booking
agents. ``We're not like all those stressed-out people in
Stockholm,'' she said. ``They think we sound honest and
dependable.''
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The story of Madeleine Albright is enough to make a strong heart
gloomy.
</P>
<P>
   When she became U.S. secretary of state 18 months ago, things
seemed splendid. She was the first woman in the job; she had an
appealing personal story, as a childhood refugee from Hitler and
Stalin; she exuded the charm and fluency so important in the age of
television.
</P>
<P>
   She had more star power than any secretary of state since Henry
Kissinger, a fact especially noticeable because she succeeded
plodding Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these days almost nobody speaks well of her. And this raises
painful questions about America's capacity for leadership.
</P>
<P>
   People said that Mrs. Albright's charm would invigorate foreign
policy. She knew how to get the rest of the administration on her
side. She knew how to persuade voters not to be bored by abroad.
She knew how to coax the chivalrous Southerner out of Jesse Helms,
the usually cantankerous chairman of the Senate foreign-relations
committee.
</P>
<P>
   And she sounded bold. She described America as the
``indispensable nation.'' She said her mindset was formed by Munich
rather than Vietnam, meaning that she would not shrink from using
force against tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, Mrs. Albright's clout within the administration
helped to keep America engaged in Bosnia. But then her clout seemed
to wane.
</P>
<P>
   In May she delivered an ultimatum to Israel: cooperate on a new
peace plan, or America will be rough on you. Israel refused to
cooperate, but Clinton refused to get rough: Mrs. Albright seemed
to have less leverage at the White House than Israel's lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underline this point, the president recently appointed
her rival, Richard Holbrooke, as ambassador to the United Nations:
the word is that the secretary of state was informed rather than
consulted about this.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Albright's reputation for connecting with Middle America
has faded, too. In February, in a college gymnasium in Ohio, she
and two other top administration officials made the case for
containing Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   They failed to win over their audience, and this debacle helps
to explain why America's response to Iraq's current defiance of
U.N. sanctions has so far been mushy.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Albright's courtship of Helms has also delivered less than
had been hoped. It eased the passage of NATO enlargement in the
Senate, and helped get the chemical-weapons treaty through: both
considerable achievements. But Congress still refuses to pay
America's past U.N. dues, and jerks its knee at administration
policies from freeing trade to engaging China.
</P>
<P>
   Because Mrs. Albright has not always won the backing of the
president, voters and Congress, she has failed to deliver on her
bold rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   She promised a Munich mind-set; but NATO still shrinks from
deterring Serbian attacks on Kosovo. She promised that the
indispensable nation would make its influence felt; but Israel has
shown it can dispense with her advice quite cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when Mrs. Albright promises that the terrorists who blew up
American embassies in Africa will be found and punished,
Washington's commentariat raises its eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   What to make of this humiliation? Some say it shows that charm
and sound bites are no substitute for geopolitical grasp, or
(depending on the critic's point of view) for attention to detail.
</P>
<P>
   This is unfair. Mrs. Albright, a former academic, grasps
geopolitics as well as the next wonk; and she has deputies to worry
about detail.
</P>
<P>
   Others suggest that Mrs. Albright has been undermined by a
president who thinks about scandals more than foreign policy. But
Clinton has actually made foreign policy a feature of his second
term, so this is not the whole answer.
</P>
<P>
   The better explanation for Mrs. Albright's comedown lies not in
scandals or in her personal failings, but in the nature of her job.
Hence the painful possibility that whoever comes next will also
have trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Cold War, America's foreign ministers have
been in a bind. If they speak in vague and cautious tones, their
countrymen will be confirmed in their suspicion that foreign policy
is a hopeless muddle and may anyway no longer matter.
</P>
<P>
   This is what happened in Clinton's first term: Christopher was
grey, so Congress slashed the foreign-policy budget and other bits
of the administration grabbed juicy issues (Japan policy was run
first by the trade negotiators and then by the Pentagon).
</P>
<P>
   If foreign ministers speak boldly, on the other hand, they may
fall into Mrs. Albright's trap. They will command admiring
attention for a while. But they may fail to deliver on their bold
words, in which case humiliation will follow.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is a general problem of America's divided
government: each power center is tempted to proclaim a vision in
order to stay ahead of its rivals, but at the same time the
division of power tends to block the action needed to deliver on
the vision.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the problem is especially acute in foreign policy. For one
thing, the temptation to proclaim vision is uncommonly powerful:
you can get away with vision-free steadiness on transport policy,
but if you propose to risk soldiers' lives you need a
grand-sounding reason.
</P>
<P>
   For another, the task of living up to a vision is uncommonly
tough. Unlike roads, the myriad trouble spots of the post-Cold-War
world do not lie quietly there while you wonder how to fix them.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean that the predicament of America's secretary of
state is hopeless? No: just difficult. It is possible, after all,
to imagine a set of conditions under which Mrs. Albright might have
fared better.
</P>
<P>
   If she had enjoyed a stronger personal relationship with
Clinton, she might have avoided the boomerang ultimatum to Israel.
If she had chosen a friendlier setting than a gym full of students,
she might have avoided the public relations debacle on what to do
about Saddam Hussein. If Clinton had been undistracted by scandal,
he might have backed her more vigorously in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the next secretary of state will succeed famously;
perhaps this one, as she probably deserves, will recover from her
woes. Alas, the odds are daunting. &QL;

JOURNAL REPORTER WHO COVERED BARNICLE STORY   LEAVES PAPER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Mike Barnicle saga _ and the heightened
journalistic scrutiny and self-examination in this summer of media
mea culpas _ may have claimed another victim. James S. Hirsch, a
three-year veteran of The Wall Street Journal's Boston bureau, left
the newspaper this week after a problem surfaced in his Aug. 12
story on the previous day's decision by The Boston Globe to suspend
Barnicle for two months rather than terminate him.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Barnicle resigned from the Globe after new
questions about his credibility arose and he was unable to verify
the reporting behind an Oct. 8, 1995, column.
</P>
<P>
   In his Aug. 12 story, Hirsch wrote that the Globe's owner, The
New York Times Co., ``declined to comment'' on the decision to
suspend Barnicle.
</P>
<P>
   But the Journal subsequently published a correction stating that
``the Times had not been called for comment on the article.'' The
Times' official position was: ``We support the Globe's right to
make its own decision.'' After the Aug. 12 story, the Times pointed
out the error in a letter to the Journal's managing editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Hirsch knowingly printed an untruth, which we take very
seriously,'' said Journal spokeswoman Karen Miller Pensiero. ``It
violated our compact with our readers. We considered all of the
circumstances and the reporter was disciplined.'' The company also
confirmed that Hirsch no longer worked at the Journal, but would
not comment on the particulars of his leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch also declined to comment on the circumstances of his
departure.
</P>
<P>
   In his nine-year career at the Journal, Hirsch built a
reputation as a sharp and solid newsman among his peers. Besides
covering the Barnicle travails, he wrote a notable front-page story
in late May detailing the financial problems besetting Fidelity
Investments' Community Newspaper Company.

 &HT;    No end in sight for Sudanese famine without peace, diplomat
warns
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ A United Nations official said Thursday that,
despite a relief effort on a scale seldom seen before, famine in
Sudan will end only when that country's warring factions make
peace.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomat, speaking to reporters here after concluding a
10-day tour of Sudan, said the situation continues to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suffering which one sees surpasses one's worst
nightmares,'' said Tom Vraalsen, the U.N. secretary general's
special envoy for humanitarian affairs in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Vraalsen spoke before the U.S. attack on a plant in the Sudan
suspected of making agents for use in chemical weapons. Late last
year, however, a Sudanese opposition group claimed that the
government was making chemical weapons and using them in its war
against southern rebels. The war has been blamed by many for
creating the country's famine conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In the southwestern town of Wau, Vraalsen said, 70 people are
dying every day. CARE, the Atlanta-based relief organization, is in
the process of setting up feeding stations in Wau right now.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan, Africa's largest country, has been wracked for 15 years
by a civil war between the Islamic government of the north, where
the population is largely Arab, and rebels in the south, where the
population is predominantly black.
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers say that both sides have pushed people off their
land, looting their cattle and preventing them from growing crops.
The famine has been exacerbated by drought.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of lives lost and people displaced, the war in Sudan is
currently the most costly conflict in the world, Vraalsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five relief organizations, operating under a U.N.
umbrella organization called Operation Lifeline Sudan, are running
what Vraalsen said was the largest airlift ever run in Africa. The
operation, based in northwestern Kenya, flies 14 planes, including
six C-130 cargo planes, that ferry food and supplies into feeding
stations in Sudan and air drop supplies to areas that are otherwise
inaccessible.
</P>
<P>
   But Vraalsen said that is still not enough to meet current needs
or forestall future famines _ a point he said he raised with
leaders from both the government and the rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all my talks, I made the point that relief, in itself, is
no solution,'' Vraalsen said. ''And I emphasized that a solution
must be found. The international community cannot sustain
indefinitely this humanitarian operation at this level. It is
simply not do-able.''
</P>
<P>
   The envoy called for an extension of the current cease fire, due
to expire in six weeks, and its expansion to more areas of the
country where people are in need.
</P>
<P>
   He said the international community should press the warring
factions to reach a permanent agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no prospect of early peace,'' he acknowledged. ``But
we cannot give up.''

U.N. RENEWS ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ After a defiant outburst from Baghdad on
Thursday, the Security Council voted unanimously to renew economic
sanctions against Iraq, and the U.S. representative to the United
Nations warned that the sanctions might never be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to mend his fences with Iraq, Richard Butler, the
chief U.N. arms inspector, wrote to Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz on Wednesday saying the Security Council had ordered him
to continue his work and inviting Baghdad to resume cooperation
with his inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   But Aziz rejected that suggestion in a strongly worded statement
in Baghdad Thursday, saying Iraq does not trust Butler and will not
cooperate with U.N. inspectors seeking to eliminate its weapons of
mass destruction until the Security Council starts lifting the
trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
   He said Iraq would not change its position ``until the council
seriously and sincerely considers, away from American pressure and
blackmail, Iraq's legitimate demands,'' starting with lifting the
embargo, according to a Reuters report from Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   With Iraq clearly in violation of its orders, the Security
Council had no alternative in its regular review but to maintain
the trade embargo it imposed after Baghdad's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   After reporting that the council had found Iraq's behavior
``totally unacceptable,'' Danilo Turk, Slovenia's representative
and this month's council president, announced that Iraq had not met
conditions for altering the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   America's representative, Bill Richardson, went further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sanctions may stay on in perpetuity'' he said Thursday,
echoing the warning he made after a council meeting on Monday that
``sanctions are going to stay on for ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Such remarks are fueling speculation among diplomats here that
with many of Iraq's most dangerous weapons eliminated and the
administration clearly reluctant to seek a new military
confrontation, the focus of U.S. policy might be shifting.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of concentrating on further disarming President Saddam
Hussein, the United States may now be more interested in insuring
that he remains a powerless pariah in Middle East affairs by
maintaining sanctions and denying him the ability to rearm.
</P>
<P>
   If that is the strategy, then Iraq's regular confrontations with
the United Nations and its arms inspectors are only reinforcing the
continuation of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the council told the arms inspectors to continue their
regular work, but Butler says that is impossible without Iraq's
assistance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Thursday China suggested that the Security Council talk
directly to the Iraqi leadership, perhaps inviting Aziz to meet
members in New York as it has during previous disputes.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States wants Secretary General Kofi Annan to get
more involved because Iraq's decision to cease cooperation with the
arms inspectors breaches the agreement he negotiated personally
with Aziz in Baghdad in February that averted new military strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said Thursday: ``The next step is up to the secretary
general. We want to see his active diplomacy and skills.''
</P>
<P>
   But aides say Annan is reluctant to get more involved, fearing
that this would compromise his independence by making him seem an
instrument of American foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he has suggested that the council hold a ``comprehensive
review'' of the sanctions it has imposed on Iraq. But that has
little appeal to Baghdad since Annan cannot guarantee that such a
review would lead to any easing.

RANKIE RUIZ WAS SALSA'S SHOOTING STAR 
</HEADLINE>

 By ALISA VALDES-RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I guess it's no surprise to me that salsa singer Frankie Ruiz
died last week at the age of 40, of liver cirrhosis. Anyone who
followed Ruiz's career _ his stints in jail, his fistfights with
flight attendants, his record company's publicity campaign about
his supposed drug and alcohol rehabilitation _ could have seen it
coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew this was going to happen,'' said Carrie Sanchez, who
had been Mr. Ruiz's booking agent for the past eight years, in a
phone interview from her New York office this week. ``He'd been
sick on and off for a year and eight months.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm remembering the one time I ended up backstage at a concert
of Mr. Ruiz's, at Vincent's nightclub in Randolph in 1995. I'd been
left breathless by his performance, and yet there he was,
staggering and reeking of alcohol after the show. He rolled his
sleeve up and excused himself _ and a syringe _ to the bathroom for
10 minutes before the interview could happen. He reappeared, moist
and clammy, and kept repeating himself. He looked like a little
boy: guilty and innocent all at once, trying to act professional,
unable to, pulled down by the layers of gold jewelry he wore around
his neck as surely as if they were made of lead. He was thinner
than he was in pictures I'd seen before. Most of all, I am
remembering the sad, faraway, decidedly drugged look in his eyes,
and my thoughts at the time: He can't go on like this. No one
could.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Ruiz was a rare talent. His voice may not have been the
strongest or most versatile in salsa, but it was passionate, part
of the reason it became the cornerstone of the salsa romantica
movement of the 1980s. His was a harsh tenor in some ways younger
than its owner, a voice almost adolescent in the sharp ways it
pulled unexpected notes out of scales and then hung them out where
we could see. When he performed, he meant it. No mild walking about
the stage for Mr. Ruiz. Rather, he bent into his notes, strained
for them, and the music became a person he danced with up there. It
was dazzling to watch, and heartbreaking to hear. The lyrics were
love poems. And yet, even then he was dying, before our eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Born Jose Antonio Terresola Ruiz in Patterson, N.J., on March
10, 1958, Mr. Ruiz began singing professionally, with the stage
name of Frankie Ruiz, as an adolescent, in  &UR; gfspanish &LR; Mayaguez,
Puerto Rico, where he had moved at the age of 7. At 15, his mother
took him to the Maricao nightclub, and proceeded to beg Roberto
Rivera, the leader of a band called La Solucion, to let her son
sing a tune or two.
</P>
<P>
   What Rivera did not expect was that the young Mr. Ruiz would
floor him. Soon after that night, the band had a new teenage singer
named Frankie. A couple of years later, he left the group to join
the Tommy Olivencia orchestra. Mr. Ruiz performed with the group
until 1980, when as a 22-year-old he decided to pursue a solo
career.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to release seven solo records, including the three
most recent ones: ``Mi Historia'' (1997), ``En Vivo'' (1996), and
``Tranquilo'' (1996). He had numerous hit songs, including ``La
Rueda,'' ``La Cura,'' ``Desnudate Mujer,'' and ``Mi Libertad.'' As
are most salsa singers, he was known for a sung signature phrase;
in Mr. Ruiz's case, it was ``Vaya, mi China!'' (roughly, ``Go,
baby!''). Even as the tawdry dramas of his personal life unfolded
in the Spanish tabloids, Mr. Ruiz was embraced by his fans.
</P>
<P>
   He was awarded many prizes in Latin America over the years, and
just last year won his first mainstream trophy in the United
States, in Billboard's Latin Music Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to Billboard magazine recently, Ralph Mercado,
president of RMM Records, for whichMr. Ruiz once recorded,
summarized the singer's tragedy: ``He had a brilliant career, but
he never took time to try and get cured.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Ruiz did not want to die in that room at University Hospital
in Newark, N.J., on Aug. 9, 1998, at 11:40 p.m., and he had said as
much. His father, girlfriend, ex-wife, and cousins were there,
watching helplessly. He'd been hospitalized before, and always he
managed to pull through. In fact, he had told friends he wanted God
to cure him this time, so that he could finish the album he had
been working on, a tribute to his favorite salsa singer of all
time, Hector Lavoe. According to the The Record (Bergen County,
N.J.), Mr. Ruiz told his father on his deathbed, ``When I die, play
my music.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Ruiz was buried in Fairlawn, N.J., near his most recent home
town of Union City. Memorial services have been held for him at the
Ortiz funeral home in the Bronx, and at City Hall in Mayaguez,
where the mayor called for three days of mourning for the town's
most famous musician. Mr. Ruiz leaves his father, Frank Terresola,
and three children: Cristina, Yaritza, and Frankie Jr. Hundreds of
Internet postings in makeshift mourning sites testify to the
singer's loyal following worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Ruiz's record company, Rodven/Polygram Latino, plans to
release the songs he had been working on at the time of his death,
in a disc called, appropriately, ``Nacimientos Y Recuerdos (Births
and Memories).''

HEARING THE STORIES THAT BUILDINGS HAVE TO TELL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 23) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (AtTN: Calif., Mass.)  (af) 
 Rita Felciano is the dance critic for the San Francisco Bay
Guardian.  
 By RITA FELCIANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The aboriginal people of Australia believe that
the natural features of the land are the traces of ancestors who
dreamed the earth into being.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco choreographer Joanna Haigood would understand.
Her mythic landscapes include historic cemeteries, old warehouses,
abandoned gyms and rotting piers. For Ms. Haigood, architecture
harbors ancestral memories; buildings and spaces have stories to
tell, and she means to find out what they are.
</P>
<P>
   Her latest and largest investigation is titled ``Invisible
Wings,'' a work inspired by a building on the rambling grounds of
the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass. Now housing a
bookstore, the structure served as a safe house for slaves fleeing
along the Underground Railroad before the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Haigood and her company, the Zaccho Dance Theater, will
present the dance at the festival beginning Tuesday through
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Four years in the making and involving some 50 collaborators,
``Wings'' incorporates African-American storytelling by Diane
Ferlatte and original music by Lauren Weinger as well as
19th-century slave songs collected by Linda Tillery, all in the
cause of evoking slave culture.
</P>
<P>
   At the dance's premiere in July, at the historic Fort Point in
San Francisco, audiences were met outside the walls by a Mother
Africa figure, then ushered inside through a tunnel in which a
dancer recreated the trans-Atlantic Middle Passage.
</P>
<P>
   In the courtyard, as the wind howled and traffic rumbled across
the Golden Gate Bridge above, performers enacted scenes of
plantation life, both in the slave quarters and in the master's Big
House, and of people escaping from it. (The dance has been
reconceived for the Jacob's Pillow performance. Audiences there
will assemble in a wooded area for an opening scene involving the
capture of an escaped slave, then move indoors.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I make dances for places,'' said Ms. Haigood, 41, who won a
Guggenheim Fellowship in 1997 and, this year, a Cal Arts/Alpert
Award in Arts grant, for $50,000, given to artists in
``early-midcareer.'' For her, places are not only physical
environments but also locations of collective human memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``History is in evidence everywhere in our environment,'' she
said recently in her light-flooded studio in a former mattress
factory in San Francisco. ``But we have pretty much learned to
ignore it. Every scar in this room, every dip in the concrete,
every change of color has a story. What fascinates me is to go to
that one spot there'' _ she points to a nick on the white-washed
wall _ ``and bring my largest magnifying glasses to it; that is,
all of my senses and my intellect. To draw some of the information
forward and share it with people.''
</P>
<P>
   She has done this for 15 years with metaphors of movement:
performers climbing walls, walking on ceilings, floating in water
tanks, balancing on industrial cranes, swinging from trapezes and
dropping themselves off 30-foot ladders.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Ms. Haigood creates her own physical environments in
the hope that ``people will shift their perspective, or just
broaden their relationship with the place they inhabit.''
</P>
<P>
   In one work, ``The Inside Room,'' she mounted a sofa on a wall
eight feet above the ground and had a chair swing from a rope. In
``The Voyager,'' a half-dozen dancers stayed airborne within an
elaborate framework of eight ladders. For a recent solo, ``Dance in
a Bed on a Wall,'' Ms. Haigood attached a queen-size bed at a
slight angle some 20 feet above the floor and performed on, under,
over and alongside it.
</P>
<P>
   She is probably best known for an early piece, ``Yal,'' for
which she used a trapeze that alternately expanded and restricted
her possibilities for movement.
</P>
<P>
   Though performers in the Zaccho Dance Theater (the name comes
from the segment of a Greek column that anchors it to the ground)
move above the floor as often as on it, there is nothing circuslike
or athletically spectacular to the choreography. The language is
sparse, concentrated and stripped down. Most notable is how Ms.
Haigood paces her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I move toward slowing things down,'' she explained. ``It takes
people a long time to absorb something deeply because we are so
constantly bombarded with sensations. So I know if I slow things
down or give them several things to look at at the same time, they
can start the process of wandering through an atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Another striking aspect of her pieces is their dreamlike,
sometimes quasi-ritualistic quality. ``Dreams are important to
me,'' she said. ``They are the place where I can listen to my
intuitions in a deeper way. It's also the place where great
fantasies are born.'' Sometimes with surprising results.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Haigood once unsettled an audience of 400 at the end of a
solo work created for and performed at a Roman cemetery in Arles,
France. She closed the piece, ``Journey From Elysian Fields,'' by
climbing out of a tomb and slowly ascending the outside of a tower
before disappearing into a beam of light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had decided not to come back for a bow,'' she recalled,
laughing. ``It just didn't seem appropriate. People apparently just
freaked out because they couldn't figure out what had happened to
me.'' She finally relented and returned for a bow.
</P>
<P>
   One of her earliest architecture-specific pieces is ``Building
T952,'' which called forth ghosts of its own. Set in and inspired
by an abandoned army gymnasium at Fort Barry, across the Golden
Gate Bridge in Marin County, the dance brought eerily to life a
time when the fort was a place from which GI's were shipped to the
Pacific during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asking'' the wood-frame structure to release its secrets, Ms.
Haigood had dark-clad figures spill from a rear balcony; another
dropped from the ceiling through a hatch door. Still other dancers
crawled along support beams and radiators or called up a
long-forgotten game of basketball. One young couple waltzed, the
woman's head nestled against the man's neck.
</P>
<P>
   None of her research has been as arduous or as personally moving
as that for ``Invisible Wings,'' a work commissioned by Jacob's
Pillow. ``I did lots of reading and traveled to libraries,'' she
said. ``I interviewed people in Georgia and South Carolina, where
my father is from and where there still is evidence of slave
culture. People were very generous in sharing the information.''
</P>
<P>
   She remembers the sadness in the voice of an old man in Sea
Island, Ga., who walked with her through fields that had been
deeded to his family by slave owners after Emancipation, fields now
threatened by developers who had made his neighbors offers they
couldn't refuse.
</P>
<P>
   She listened to the voices of slaves recorded in the early 1930s
by Zora Neale Hurston and Alan Lomax, and she looked at hundreds of
faces in archival photographs and documentary films like ``Roots of
Resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   She also read slave accounts, like one about Margaret Garner,
whose story was the inspiration for Toni Morrison's novel
``Beloved.'' Garner killed one of her infants rather than let him
grow up in slavery and ``rejoiced'' when another drowned in a
boating accident after they were caught escaping.
</P>
<P>
   Another account was of a kindly soul who found an escaped slave
he was going to help hanging from a tree, still wearing an iron
neck brace with bells attached. ``His body,'' said Ms. Haigood,
``was perfectly intact. The bells had kept the birds away.''
</P>
<P>
   The more she researched this material, ``the more I realized how
enormous it was,'' she said, ``and how much we are still in
denial.'' She used her findings not to recreate specific incidents
but to construct a vast landscape out of which she fashioned
``Invisible Wings.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Haigood even drew up a genealogy of the Carter family, who
in the 19th century homesteaded the farm that is now Jacob's
Pillow. One Carter descendant was born on the property and will
attend the Pillow performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed me all of these family pictures but didn't know how
the people were related to each other,'' she recalled of their
first meeting. ``So I pulled out this sheet of paper, and we were
able to put names and relationships to the faces.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service is considering sponsoring a tour in
which ``Invisible Wings'' would be performed at other Underground
Railroad sites around the country.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Haigood, she is deep in preparation for her next
site-specific work, a commission by Dancing in the Streets for the
Red Hook section of Brooklyn. There, a dilapidated 19th-century
grain terminal has caught her fancy. ``The building is really
beautiful, even though now it's mostly a symbol of the area's
collapse,'' she said. ``But grain,'' she added, smiling, ``is the
seed of life.''

<P>
   LONGYEARBYEN, Norway _ Five gravediggers from London were
scheduled to started digging here Friday morning. Actually, much of
the time they will be hammering through ice.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the islands of Spitsbergen in the high Arctic between
mainland Norway and Greenland, the ground three feet down is always
frozen in permafrost. At six feet, they should find the bodies, in
the mass grave encased in a tomb of ice.
</P>
<P>
   It is the time of the midnight sun. A white fox slinks up the
steep hill overlooking this small mining town, its camouflage coat
useless now against the bare rock and dark moss. The seed-fluff
from the arctic cottongrass floats on the breeze among the rows of
white wooden crosses.
</P>
<P>
   Over the mass grave, a tent with a special air lock has been
stretched and inflated. The tent is for privacy in this somber
enterprise and protection against anything possibly dangerous
escaping into the outside air. Inside, the diggers, with medical
scientists at their side, will go about their business of opening
the resting place of seven young men who were buried here 80 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   This is a critical moment in one of the most ambitious efforts
yet to solve an intractable medical mystery: What caused the
influenza pandemic of 1918 and early 1919? Why was this particular
contagion so virulent that it killed an estimated 20 million to 40
million people worldwide?
</P>
<P>
   The secret of one of the most lethal viruses the world has ever
known may dwell in the lungs of these seven victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years' work culminates in the next few weeks,'' Dr.
Kirsty Duncan, who is directing the project, said as final
preparations were under way. She specializes in medical geography
and teaches at the universities of Windsor and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by reading ``America's Forgotten Pandemic: The
Influenza Of 1918,'' (Cambridge University Press) by Alfred W.
Crosby of the University of Texas, she began the search for flu
victims whose bodies might be preserved in ice. The research led
scientists to the mass grave in the cemetery here.
</P>
<P>
   In a diary kept by the coal mining company here, Dr. Duncan
found the names of the seven men, 18 to 29 years old, farmers and
fishermen who had just arrived here to earn extra money at winter
jobs in the mine. But they had contracted flu on the boat trip from
the mainland and died in the first week of October 1918.
</P>
<P>
   The sight of their names on the six crosses and one headstone at
the back of the cemetery moved Dr. Duncan to tears: Johan Bjerk,
William Henry Richardsen, Ole Kristofferson, Magnus Gabrielson,
Tormod Albrigtsen, Hans Hansen and Kristian Hansen.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Duncan impressed Norwegian authorities with the importance
of the project of isolating and describing at last the unknown 1918
virus. She emphasized the safety precautions that would be taken.
The authorities then obtained permissions from the families to
exhume and examine six of the seven bodies (all but
Kristofferson's).
</P>
<P>
   By the time the permissions came through, Dr. Duncan had
gathered an international group of pathologists, virologists,
molecular biologists, geologists and medical archeologists for the
work.
</P>
<P>
   A survey with ground-penetrating radar established that the
bodies, side by side, were indeed in permanent permafrost and thus
should be well preserved for medical study. A team of experienced
gravediggers from Necropolis Co. in London was hired.
</P>
<P>
   After the topsoil is removed by spade and the permafrost is
penetrated with electric jack hammer, Dr. Charles R. Smith, a
pathologist from the Hospital for Sick Children at the University
of Toronto, plans to remove samples of tissues from the victims'
lungs, intestines and other organs. The bodies, which were not
embalmed, will not be thawed or taken from the grave, both out of
respect and as a precaution against the spread of any infectious
material.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists seriously doubt that any of the flu virus will
still be alive, but just in case, they will be wearing modified
space suits with self-contained breathing apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   Once the tissues are extracted, portions of each sample will be
sealed in separate vials and shipped to laboratories in Norway,
Canada, Britain and the United States. The most sensitive
investigations will be conducted at the U.S. Army's infectious
disease research laboratory in Fort Detrick, Md. and the National
Institute of Medical Research in London, which are equipped to
maintain the highest levels of biological containment of unknown
organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Bergan of the University of Oslo, a virologist on the
team, said the tissue samples would not be touched until they
arrived at the laboratories. ``Our first obligation is safety
requirements against the risk of contamination,'' Bergan said. ``We
want to make sure there is no viable virus in the sample and, if
there is, protect against its escape into the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergan said the research might help determine the composition,
genetic structure and nature of the 1918 virus, in particular its
exterior surfaces, where the virus attaches itself to the lining of
the lungs and the upper respiratory tract. Such knowledge could
lead to the development of a vaccine against this acute form of
influenza and tests and modifications of current or new anti-viral
drugs for treating the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The pandemic occurred near the close of World War I, when
doctors had yet to learn that influenza is caused by a virus and
they had no antibiotics to treat bacterial infections like
pneumonia that often attacked the weakened bodies and contributed
to death.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Scientists in the project said it might take several months,
maybe a year, of analysis before they would be ready to publish
their findings.
</P>
<P>
   Their undertaking comes at a time when the search for the 1918
virus has gained momentum on several fronts. Last year, Dr. Jeffrey
K. Taubenberger, a biologist at the Armed Forces Institute of
Pathology in Washington, reported finding viral fragments in
preserved lung tissue of two U.S. soldiers who died of flu in World
War I. The specimens were in a collection of autopsy tissue, soaked
in formaldehyde and encased in paraffin, that the Army has kept
since the Civil War. The analysis of the material has enabled the
scientists to map at least one of the virus' protein-making genes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Johan Hultin, a retired pathologist who lives in San
Francisco, went to the tundra of Alaska last year and exhumed the
well preserved body of an Eskimo woman who died of the 1918 flu. He
sent lung tissue samples to Taubenberger, who was able to isolate
more viral traces.
</P>
<P>
   These findings encouraged Dr. Duncan's team in the belief that
it would also find traces of flu viruses in permafrost burials. But
for a time, Dr. Duncan wondered if there was any point in
continuing in light of the Taubenberger successes. At a meeting
with officials at the federal Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta, she was persuaded to press on.
</P>
<P>
   The project is supported by a $150,000 grant from the National
Institutes of Health in the United States and about $194,000 from
Hoffmann-La Roche, the pharmaceutical company.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Duncan emphasized the need for still more samples from other
parts of the world, especially material that has not been preserved
and possibly altered in formaldehyde.
</P>
<P>
   So head gravedigger Roger Webber is ready. He has been exhuming
bodies for 33 years, but has never worked in permafrost. It cannot
be harder than the many times he has dealt with layers of solid
chalk or limestone, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Using a technique known as needle biopsy, the pathologist,
Smith, will take bore samples of tissue from the lungs of the six
bodies. Then he will try to probe the hearts, where he may be able
to extract frozen blood. This is a long shot, but any blood could
yield samples of serum and any antibodies produced in the acute
phases of the disease. The intestines could hold bacteria, possible
clues to other complicating infections. An attempt will also be
made to get samples from the livers and spleens.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Smith said, ``You don't know what you are going to find
until you look.''
</P>
<P>
   The search for the 1918 influenza virus has apparently created
little stir in Spitsbergen. The 1,300 residents of Longyearbyen,
the island's principal community, are used to visitors with
peculiar goals in mind. Explorers like Richard E. Byrd and Roald
Amundsen set out from here in 1929 for the North Pole, about 700
miles away, and more recently, scientists have been operating bases
for studies in geophysics, climatology and polar life in the
Svalbard Archipelago, which includes Spitsbergen.
</P>
<P>
   Ann-Kristin Olsen, governor of the Svalbard Archipelago, said
that community meetings have been held to inform people of the
exhumations, and they had seemed to accept the reassurances that
the work posed no health hazard. Hallvard Holm, headmaster of the
local school, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard of a single soul who has been afraid,'' Holm
said. ``I know there have been jokes, nothing more.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the people of Spitsbergen and the tourists have more
familiar dangers on their minds. Each day hikers head off for the
rugged hills and glaciers with packs on their backs and rifles
slung over their shoulders. People are advised to carry a firearm
whenever they roam beyond town, in case they should meet up with a
hungry polar bear.

AS MORE VICTIMS ARE BURIED, SOME SEE OMAGH BLAST AS WATERSHED
TOWARD PEACE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES F. CLARITY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ As Northern Ireland buried eight
more victims of a terrorist bombing on Saturday, a guilty hope
began to emerge Thursday among officials, analysts and some
ordinary people that some good may come of the atrocity.
</P>
<P>
   The blast, which killed 28 people and injured 220 in the town of
Omagh, 60 miles to the west, was the deadliest attack in 29 years
of sectarian violence in this predominantly Protestant British
province.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are almost afraid to think it, but this tragedy may be
another watershed toward real peace,'' said Margaret Arthur, a
local painter and printmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Paul Arthur, a professor of political science at
Ulster University here, added that he had been told in recent days
by a senior American official that the blast and the public outrage
it stimulated meant that ``the war's over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That bomb has destroyed whole the movement against the peace
agreement,'' he said, referring to the accord approved in the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur added of the Real IRA, the group that claimed
responsibility for the bombing: ``They don't have the water to swim
in anymore _ no public support.''
</P>
<P>
   David McKittrick, author of several standard reference books on
Northern Ireland, wrote in Thursday's London Independent that
``while these are the worst of times for the people of Omagh, they
must also appear to the be the worst of times for the small but
shockingly dangerous splinter groups intent on bringing down'' the
new peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is thus possible,'' he added, ``to hope that the political
and moral illiterates are, one by one, realizing that war has had
its day and to hope that Ireland is still moving in the direction
of eventual peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Wood, a political consultant and former British information
director here, said the Catholic Republican guerrilla groups are
now likely to end their attacks and spend much of their time trying
to elude the police and intelligence officers of Britain and the
Irish Republic to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Wood, who was a government insider for 10 years until last year,
said the ``draconian'' security and legal measures advanced on
Wednesday by the Irish government would put more pressure on the
dissident paramilitary groups to abandon violence. But the bombing
may also lead, he said, to ``internecine blood-letting'' between
the Real IRA and the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   The Real IRA, with about 100 dissidents, some of whom are
skilled bomb-makers, broke away from the IRA after the IRA called a
cease-fire 13 months ago that helped lead to the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA, and its political wing, Sinn Fein, are embarrassed by
terrorist attacks by other, smaller, republican groups. ``And who
in Omagh, or anywhere is going to care if a couple of these guys
are murdered?,'' Wood added.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish Parliament, under Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, is to
meet in two weeks to consider, and probably approve, a series of
measures that Ahern said were ``draconian'' to combat terrorism. In
part, the proposals, which could have been made any time during the
decades of violence, are to show an angry public that the
government is acting decisively. Whether the new measures would
actually result in the capture of more terrorists is impossible to
predict.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary said Thursday that
three people being questioned about the Omagh bombing had been
released from police custody without being charged, Agence
France-Presse reported. The two others, arrested in and around the
Omagh area, on Monday, were still being held.)
</P>
<P>
   One provision being considered by the Irish government would
make it easier to imprison someone accused of membership in a
terrorist organization. Another would double, to four days, the
time a terrorist suspect could be held without being charged with a
crime. But, significantly, Ahern said the government was not
planning to revive ``internment,'' or preventive detention without
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Internment, used by the British here in the early 1970's, kept
hundreds of terrorist suspects out of action, but allowed them to
win international recognition with highly publicized hunger
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The British government of Prime Minister Tony Blair killed
internment last year. That means that if Ireland used internment,
but Britain did not, fugitives in the south, where many of the
splinter group guerrillas are based, would flee to the north.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, on vacation in France, issued a statement Thursday saying
that he and Ahern had agreed that the Real IRA ``will be dealt with
and taken off the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The measures announced by the Irish government indicate they
are being true to their word, he added. ``There is unprecedented
cooperation between our two governments as we take our plans.''
Blair did not elaborate on the specifics of the new steps.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the prime minister at Downing Street said that
Blair is not at the moment contemplating new legislation because
many of the measures can be taken by stretching the application of
existing British laws. He noted, however, that if new laws were
required, ``we will do whatever is necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood, the consultant, warned against reviving internment in
dealing with terrorists. ``The thing is,'' Wood said, ``that you do
not at all costs make them martyrs.''
</P>
<P>
   Internment, he added, would force Republicans such as Sinn Fein
into hard-line political positions, hindering the operation of the
new Northern Ireland Assembly that is to revise the political
structure of the north to give minority Catholics more power and to
give the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic more influence in
northern affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Lislianeghan, outside Omagh, Samantha McFarland,
17, a Catholic, was buried as Protestants and Catholics looked on
glumly. She had been working on Saturday afternoon in an OXFAM
shop, was evacuated by the police after they received a misleading
bomb warning from the Real IRA. Instead of away from the bomb, she
was led close to it.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Derek Quinn said, ``How cruel and ironic it is that it
was because of her very desire to help those afflicted by poverty,
injustice and oppression that she herself and her best friend would
be evacuated from that shop only to walk into the path of the bomb
that was to rob them of their very lives.''

 &HT;    Home Depot to open more stores in South America
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Depot has announced plans to step up its pace of
international expansion, adding more stores in Chile and moving
into Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   As previously announced, Atlanta-based Home Depot will open a
store next week in Santiago, with another planned later in fiscal
1998. On Thursday, the company announced it would open three more
stores in Chile the following year, in addition to a store in
Buenos Aires, Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Argentina is the next step to continue growing our South
American business, and it will complement and leverage our Chilean
store operations,'' said Arthur M. Blank, president and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Although Home Depot has been the world's largest home
improvement retailer for nearly a decade, the Santiago store marks
its first international venture outside its Canadian division. Its
cautious global growth plan has been strikingly different from its
breakneck domestic pace, which has seen the company opening stores
at an average of 100 each year over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Chile was chosen for the first Home Depot store outside North
America because of its stable economy and government, and a growing
middle class. Home Depot had looked at expansion in Mexico, but
shelved plans in 1995 because of the peso's devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   The Chile stores will be called Home Depot, complete with orange
aprons and the trademark logo, but the merchandise will be markedly
different from the U.S. selection. For example, the lumber
department has been scaled back to suit Chilean homes, which use
more bricks, concrete blocks and steel. The stores will be
predominantly stocked by local vendors, but Home Depot is using
U.S. suppliers as well.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot's main competition is Sodimac, Chile's largest home
improvement company, with revenue of $681 million and 47 stores.
(Home Depot had 1997 revenue of $24.2 billion.) Sodimac is Chile's
version of Home Depot, with stores that range in size from 80,000
to 100,000 square feet and drive-through lumberyards.
</P>
<P>
   Sodimac has recently increased its U.S. involvement, including a
new alliance with Ace Hardware, which supplies stores in Chile and
Colombia. Sodimac also just opened its first U.S. office at the
Paper Mill Office Park in Marietta to coordinate the sourcing of
international products.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot also announced Thursday management changes related to
its South American division. Bill Pena, who has been with Home
Depot since 1994, was named regional president for Argentina and
Chile, a newly created position. Pena was vice president of
international development and will continue as chairman of Home
Depot's joint venture with Falabella, Chile's largest retailer.
Pena will be based in Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting to him will be Julio Campos, a former executive of
Sodimac and general manager of Chile, and Nelson Tirado, who was
named regional vice president of operations for Argentina.

   CREDIT (New York) _ Turmoil in overseas economies sent investors
fleeing stocks for the safety of bonds Wednesday, pushing the yield
on the 30-year Treasury bond to another new low. The Dow Jones

   BOMBING-NEW-WAR (Undated) Thursday's military strikes against
targets in Afghanistan and Sudan were the first battle in a new
form of war the Pentagon has been gearing up for since 1994 _ one
against terrorists or rogue states capable of launching attacks
against U.S. targets. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Henry Shelton made
a point of noting that the U.S. operation was very different than
the Gulf War: ``We are in a different ball game today,'' Shelton
said. ``We're going against a terrorist organization, and that
calls from some different techniques.'' The military option used
Thursday is part of a multi-billion-dollar Pentagon initiative
against terrorism that was began in late 1993 and formally was made
part of defense planning and budgets the next year. It was a
reponse to the heightened threat of nuclear, biological or chemical
attacks against American targets.

MISSILES USED IN STRIKES HAVE IMPROVED GUIDANCE SYSTEMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Tomahawk cruise missiles that struck Afghanistan
and Sudan Thursday are much more likely to hit their targets than
the Tomahawks of just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1991 Gulf War, according to the official postmortem
studies by the US Defense Intelligence Agency, only about half the
cruise missiles even got close to their targets _ and fewer still
achieved destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the older Tomahawks is that their guidance
system relied entirely on sensors that compared key features of the
terrain, over which the missile would fly, with a pre-programmed
radar-map of the flightpath. Most of Iraq is flat; the terrain has
few distinctive features. And so, back then, the Tomahawks _ which
have a range of 700 miles _ often got lost on the way to their
destination.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's attack _ which reportedly involved at least 75 cruise
missiles fired from the Arabian and Red Seas _ was probably more
successful for two reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, Afghanistan and Sudan have more distinctive geological
features that the Tomahawk guidance system can more easily follow.
</P>
<P>
   Second, and more important, the newest version of Tomahawks,
costing about $750,000 each, are guided not only by terrain-radar
but also by Global Positioning Satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Many cars these days have GPS-receivers that, hooked up to a
map, let drivers know where they are and where they are going. The
principle of GPS-guided weapons systems is much the same.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the technicians who program a missile's flight path
do not need to worry about following distinctive terrain. They
simply plug in the coordinates of the target _ and the missile can
be programmed to take any number of paths.
</P>
<P>
   The Tomahawk's warhead explodes with the force of 1,000 pounds
of TNT _ not terribly destructive _ but the barrage of Thursday's
attack should have assured great damage, even allowing for the
possibility of some wayward weapons.
</P>
<P>
   John Pike, weapons specialist at the Federation of American
Scientists, calculated that _ based on known data about satellite
orbits _ a USA-116 Keyhole spy-satellite flew over Afghanistan 45
minutes after Thursday's attack. Another satellite passed over
shortly after that.
</P>
<P>
   The Keyhole, which has optical sensors that see in the dark,
could have taken and transmitted photographs before and after the
attack, allowing analysts to tell how much damage was done.

SUSAN GRAHAM PUTS PEP IN LANGUID PAST  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SUNDAY, 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANNE MIDGETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like Proust, his sometime lover, the composer Reynaldo Hahn was
a figure of his time; and like Proust's writing, Hahn's music has a
flavor so distinctive that for some listeners a little goes a long
way.
</P>
<P>
   The title of Susan Graham's new recording of Hahn songs, ``La
Belle Epoque'' (Sony Classical ASK 60168), accurately indicates
that the music is the expression of a particular period in history.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Graham approaches this past in the spirit of the
present, bringing an element of robustness to an inherently dainty
table: a happy illustration of the best that can happen when an
American singer interprets European music.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the songs at face value rather than seeking to capture a
period style, Ms. Graham sings with a freshness and pep that ward
off the incipient languor of Hahn's ``pastiche'' explorations of
the idioms of bygone eras (like the opening ``A Chloris'') and
filter some of the saccharin from his forays into a more
operettalike idiom (``Mai'').
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, the recording does present a broad selection of
Hahn's songs, more than half of them written before the composer, a
prodigy, was 21. (He wrote his best-known song, ``Si Mes Vers
Avaient des Ailes,'' which concludes this recording, at 13.)
</P>
<P>
   Having established a fin-de-siecle mode with the nostalgia of
``A Chloris'' (its accompaniment derived from the bass line of
Bach's ``Air on the G String''), ``Le Rossignol de Lilas,'' another
pretty evocation of the past, and the romantic effusions of
``L'Enamouree,'' Ms. Graham continues with a wide range of
material.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the predominance of languid, arpeggioed accompaniments (as
in the lovely ``L'Heure Exquise'') or repeated chord progressions
of 18th-century pastiches is offset by bursts of exuberance (``Le
Printemps'') or moments of buffo drollery (``Quand Je Fus Pris au
Pavillon'').
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Graham manages the feat, difficult for a foreign singer, of
maintaining both vocal color and accurate French vowels. Here, as
on the opera stage, she produces a warm tone without artificially
``darkening'' the voice; and it's commendable that she avoids the
overly melodramatic.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she sometimes errs in the opposite direction, pulling
back too far (although this tendency is not to be confused with a
mannered and deliberate lightness, which she also avoids). Because
she sometimes leans into the notes, her delicate high notes, like
the G on ``parmi'' in the last line of ``Fetes Galantes,'' can
sound on first hearing as if they weren't in line with the rest of
the voice, although they are.
</P>
<P>
   Her diction is generally good, if smacking a bit of the textbook
in places; and her vibrato is rapid. But these are nitpicking
observations about a recording that will bear repeated hearings and
shows a singer making a worthwhile foray into a less-known
repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Musically and temperamentally, Roger Vignoles, the pianist, is a
good match for Ms. Graham, playing with firmness and subdued energy
to bring a spark to potentially precious pastiches.

EX-KLANSMAN QUIZZED IN BOWERS FIREBOMBNG TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HATTIESBURG, Miss. _ Devours Nix, a one-time Klansman, took the
stand Thursday on behalf of his friend, Sam Bowers, the imperial
wizard of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, to call Bowers a
``real, real nice man'' and to describe the Klan as a
``benevolent'' organization that handed out fruit baskets at
Christmastime.
</P>
<P>
   Nix's testimony, on the fourth day of Bowers' trial for murder
in the 1966 firebombing of Hattiesburg NAACP president Vernon
Dahmer, provoked snickers of disbelief in the crowded courtroom.
His credibility was shredded further during cross-examination when
he denied owning Klan paraphenalia and the prosecution produced an
old photo of Nix dressed in a hooded robe and carrying a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Nix was originally arrested with Bowers and a dozen other
Klansmen 32 years ago, but he has never been tried. He was
rearrested with Bowers and a third defendant last spring after new
evidence prompted the state to revive the case.
</P>
<P>
   The 72-year-old Nix, now awaiting trial for arson in the Dahmer
case, spoke from a wheelchair, his hands trembling from a reaction
to medication, he said, and with tubes inserted in his nostrils to
supply oxygen. He was released on his own recognizance because of
health reasons following his arrest, but called back to court weeks
later after a photographer for a Jackson newspaper captured him
playing golf. The same day the photo was published, Nix was
arrested again and required to post a $50,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   After the prosecution rested its case, the defense took the
initiative. But the trial was briefly disrupted when Richard
Barrett, a white supremacist with a minuscule following in the
state, began passing out leaflets describing ``The crimes of Vernon
Dahmer'' and predicting that Mississippi would ``whip the NAACP.''
</P>
<P>
   When Circuit Judge Richard McKenzie ordered Barrett arrested for
contempt of court, many spectators burst into applause.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers' attorney, Travis Buckley, appealed for a mistrial, but
since the incident took place out of sight of the jury the motion
was denied.
</P>
<P>
   After Buckley led Nix through two hours of testimony in which
the witness contradicted himself several times, prosecuting
attorney Robert Helfrich opened the cross-examination by asking:
``Mr. Nix, do you know what perjury is?''
</P>
<P>
   Although Nix had said earlier that he did not know whether
Bowers belonged to the Klan, Helfrich reported that Nix had once
identified Bowers as the ``imperial wizard'' during a hearing in
Federal court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember that,'' Nix said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked the color of his Klan robe, Nix said: ``I didn't have
no robe.''
</P>
<P>
   Helfrich then presented Nix with a copy of a photo seized at
Nix's house during a search by authorities two months after
Dahmer's death.
</P>
<P>
   Helfrich: ``What does this person have on?''
</P>
<P>
   Nix: ``It looks like it might be a robe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With a hood?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mmm-hmm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Holding a gun?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's you, is it not?''
</P>
<P>
   When Nix replied, ``No sir, that's not me,'' laughter swept the
courtroom again.
</P>
<P>
   Helfrich said authorities noted in 1966 that Nix's wife
complained to her husband after the raid on their house: ``They
found that crazy, silly picture of you with a pointed hood on.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Nix operated John's Restaurant in nearby Laurel,
described in earlier testimony as a Klan hang-out where a jug
rested on the counter to collect funds for the defense of those
arrested in the Dahmer murder case.
</P>
<P>
   A prosecution witness, Bob Stringer, testified Wednesday that he
overheard a conversation between Bowers, Nix and another Klansman,
Henry deBoxtel, in the restaurant a few days before the raid on
Dahmer's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I overheard Bowers make a statement,'' Stringer said, ``that
the Forrest County boys were not doing their job, and that
something needs to be done about that nigger down south.''
</P>
<P>
   Dahmer lived in Forrest County, where the local Klan was deemed
ineffective during the turbulent civil rights movement three
decades ago. According to testimony here, Bowers controlled the
White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan from Laurel, a Jones County city
35 miles north of here, and a Jones County Klan unit was the one
tapped by Bowers to destroy Dahmer.
</P>
<P>
   Stringer testified that he heard deBoxtel, who has since died,
tell Bowers: ``We ought to put a `4' on him and shut him up.'' Code
4, in Klan parlance, called for death.
</P>
<P>
   Nix said he was not acquainted with Stringer, and denied ever
hearing Bowers issue a racial slur.
</P>
<P>
   Although another witness placed Nix at a Klan gathering where
Bowers called for Dahmer's elimination, Nix denied attending any
meeting where violence was discussed.
</P>
<P>
   He also denied that Klan literature was distributed at his
restaurant, though Helfrich said during cross-examination that a
1966 search of the cafe found Klan pamphlets.
</P>
<P>
   After saying he did not know whether Bowers belonged to the
Klan, Nix testified that Bowers told him Nix had been elected an
``investigator'' for the Klan. Later, he corrected himself again
and said someone other than Bowers informed him.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Nix said he learned of Dahmer's death ``on the way
to Washington'' to appear before the House Unamerican Activities
Committee. Later, he said he heard the news after he had returned
to Laurel.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was persuaded to join the Klan after learning of its
benevolent activities. Asked if he remembered the Klan oath, Nix
said, ``The only thing I recall is that you had to believe in
God.'' Asked about other parts of the oath, he paused and said,
``I'm at a loss for words.''
</P>
<P>
   Helfrich closed his cross-examination by asking Nix if he had
ever delivered any baskets of fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never delivered any,'' Nix said glumly, and he was wheeled
out of the courtroom.

   ATTACK-BINLADEN (Washington) _ How Osama bin Laden, the youngest
son of a construction magnate from Yemen, became the world's most
feared sponsor of terrorism. The religious and ideological roots of
his rage lie in the 1980s, when he worked side by side with the CIA
backing the Afghan rebels. When that battle was over, he and his
fellow holy warriors, past and present _ having defeated the
British in the 19th century and the Soviets in the 20th _ went to

   ATTACK-CONGRESS (Washington) _ The most cherished axiom of
American diplomacy is that politics stops at the water's edge,
meaning that the opposition party supports the president when
missiles are flying. Today it worked, more or less. The bulk of
congressional leaders, from Speaker Newt Gingrich to such reliable
Clinton critics as Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, rallied
around the commander-in-chief, with Gingrich declaring: ``I think

`RAT PACK' MOVIE LOOKS AT EXPLOITS OF FAMOUS FIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (NOTE: A misspelled name has been corrected) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ray Liotta likes to joke that playing Frank
Sinatra in HBO's ``The Rat Pack,'' which premieres Saturday at 9
p.m., was cake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have blue eyes. I'm from New Jersey. Close enough,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   But playing Francis Albert, 'Ol Blue Eyes, the Chairman of the
Board, was a daunting task for Liotta.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he have to overcome not looking (eyes
notwithstanding) or sounding like the man he was portraying,
Sinatra is probably the most written-about entertainer of any
generation, someone who has appeared in dozens of films, released
scores of albums and had a career that spanned four generations. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; And, Liotta, who had considered Sinatra songs his parents'
music, had to capsulize one of the most-known figures of the 20th
century in a two-hour film.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra was The Leader of the Rat Pack, the most famous
entertaining troupe in history. It included suave balladeer Dean
Martin (Joe Mantegna), incomparable musician/singer/dancer Sammy
Davis Jr. (Don Cheadle), schtick-laden comic Joey Bishop (Bobby
Slayton), and vain British actor Peter Lawford (Angus Macfadyen),
who was married to Patricia Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra becomes intoxicated with JFK's (William Petersen) style
and mends his relationship with Lawford to get on the inside of the
Kennedy camp. The skinny kid from Hoboken wanted to prove he was
more than a saloon singer. His goal: Lead Kennedy to the White
House, and then get an invite.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Liotta plays Sinatra to a manic pitch. There is
vulnerability and volatility; loyalty and lavish lifestyle; and, of
course, butts, booze and broads, baby.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, we see Joe Kennedy ask Sinatra to get gangster
friends such as Sam ``Momo'' Giancana to help fix the election. But
it's Sinatra's association with organized crime that eventually
makes him a liability to the Kennedys, Sinatra's ultimate downfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it in terms of a Greek tragedy,'' said director Rob
Cohen, ``in that Sinatra was undone by the very things that
Kennedy, for example, needed him to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Liotta, who had previously turned down the part of Sinatra for a
CBS miniseries, did a 180 and decided that this was a project he
could grab onto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out Rob didn't want to do the Joe Piscopo thing,''
Liotta said referring to the comic who is best known for his
Sinatra impersonation. ``When I read the script, I just looked at
it as a great character. I'm getting to play a guy who sings `One
for My Baby,' sleeps with Ava Gardner, goes sailing with JFK.
That's a great part.''
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriter Kario Salem, like Cohen, wasn't looking for a
Vegas-style replica act.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about the mannerisms and the sort of cartoon version
of who we think these people are,'' Salem said. ``It's about their
insides out. No one tried to impersonate these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Liotta still dug through miles of tape, stacks of discs and
reams of paper to find the real Sinatra. He took note of which hand
he held the microphone in (either), facial expressions and
mannerisms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' Liotta said, ``over one incident there's probably
seven to eight points of view. Now I know why people write
biographies, to set the record straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the actors had an individual challenge capturing their
well-known character.
</P>
<P>
   Cheadle, for instance, had to learn to tap dance, taking lessons
from choreographer Savion Glover, to play the drums and twirl a
gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gained a lot of respect,'' he said. ``I gained a lot of
insight. He wasn't anyone I either reviled or revered.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheadle, 33, had very little point of reference about Davis. He
knew him from the Mr. Bojangles/Candy Man era, and an occasional
guest stint on ``Laugh-In.'' He also knew of the photograph of
Davis hugging President Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before doing this, I always thought Sammy Davis Jr. was a
sellout. An Uncle Tom,'' Cheadle said. ``There was no place where
he stood up and said, `I know how I'm being treated, but I'm doing
it for a reason.' He looked like a pawn, a shuttlecock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thing was, though, he was a fighter. He made a decision to
become an undeniable talent and force. And through that, he got in
a lot of places and headlined a lot of clubs that wouldn't have let
him in as a patron. He was the Jackie Robinson of entertainers.''
</P>
<P>
   The film depicts Davis as a tortured artist. He winces after a
racist joke. His wife, May Britt, who was white, complains that he
is being laughed at by his so-called friends. And there is a
fantasy scene where he does a curdling version of ``I've Got You
Under My Skin'' to a batch of white supremists.
</P>
<P>
   Mantegna, the biggest Rat Pack fan of the cast, was familiar
with Martin and his style. It showed as Mantegna morphed into the
effortlessly cool style of Dino.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with all of those guys as a role model of cool for a
generation,'' he said. ``They lived in a time when we thought that
drinking and smoking was good for you.''
</P>
<P>
   As an Italian-American growing up in Chicago, Mantegna
especially looked up to Martin, whose first language was Italian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got uncles to this day who still think they are Dean
Martin,'' Mantegna said. ``He was somebody I admired and decided to
give it a whirl.''
</P>
<P>
   Slayton's stretch to play Bishop was probably the simplest. He
said that he has a lot in common with the only living member of the
Rat Pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could say, `Yeah, I spent months on the Joey Bishop
Diet,' that I did everything Joey did, hung out where Joey hung
out,'' Slayton said. ``Ray is a method actor and was really getting
into his part, getting himself all worked up. When people ask me if
it was hard playing a real-life person, I say, `Wait a second. I'm
43, which is pretty much the same age as the real Joey Bishop was
at the time. We're both from the Bronx, we're both Jewish, we're
both standup comics. We're not talking `Raging Bull' here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Slayton said that he was reluctant to speak to Bishop because he
heard he was bitter and wanted nothing to do with the project.
</P>
<P>
   They eventually spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said there was no way to recreate the swing era of the
'60s,'' Slayton said. ``Recreating five drunk entertainers chasing
broads and telling bad jokes is not that hard. Didn't Steven
Spielberg bring back dinosaurs? Didn't James Cameron put us on the
deck of the Titanic?''

TIMING OF CRUISE MISSILE ATTACK COMES UNDER FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG and MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most lawmakers, even ardent foes of President
Clinton, rallied behind his decision Thursday to attack suspected
terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan. But at least two asked
whether it was a calculated effort to change the subject from an
improper sexual relationship to national security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the president's personal difficulties this week, it is
legitimate to question the timing of this action,'' said Sen. Dan
Coats, R-Ind., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and
a longtime Clinton critic.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise missile strikes, retaliation for the Aug. 7 terrorist
bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, occurred less
than three days after Clinton reversed seven months of denials and
admitted to a relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky that he said ``was not appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The admission was a turning point in Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr's investigation of whether Clinton committed perjury and
obstructed justice in an effort to cover up the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Coats said of the military attack that took place as Lewinsky
was completing her second appearance before a federal grand jury
here: ``Once the president has broken the bond of trust with the
American people, as he has done with his repeated lies, it raises
questions about everything he does or does not do.''
</P>
<P>
   Coats said the attack could be an effort to divert attention
away from the Lewinsky matter by a chief executive ``desperately
trying to hold onto his job.'' He added, ``The timing of this was
extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said he supported the president but
stressed, ``I want to know more about the reasons and especially
the reasons for doing it now. ... Questions will be raised around
the world on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen rejected the notion that the
timing of the attack was a diversionary tactic like the one
depicted in the Hollywood film ``Wag the Dog.'' In the movie, a
fictional president embroiled in a sex scandal allows his aides to
manufacture a military crisis to divert public attention and win
reelection.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, asked about a possible analogy to the movie, said at a
news conference that ``the only motivation driving this action
today was our absolute obligation to protect the American people
from terrorist activities. That is the sole motivation. No other
consideration has been involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Most GOP lawmakers supported Clinton's decision and didn't
question the timing.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said the action was ``the
right thing to do at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said, ``The United
States has an absolute duty to attack terrorism where it lives and
breeds, in order to prevent future attacks on American citizens
around the world. The American people stand united in the face of
terrorism. The men and women who undertook this mission deserve our
praise and prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., one of the Senate's most respected
voices on defense issues, called the strikes a ``welcome response''
to the Aug. 7 embassy bombings that killed 257 people, including 12
Americans, and injured more than 5,000. ``The president did the
right thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, often a harsh Clinton critic, praised the
military action as ``clearly designed to strike at the heart of a
terrorist network that has the blood of American citizens on its
hands and which was planning further attacks on U.S. nationals.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said, ``Thank you, Mr. President. ...
Let's wage a war against terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., called the retaliation ``bold and
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   But a strong Clinton critic outside Congress, conservative
politician and Reagan administration official Oliver L. North,
said, ``Given what we know about this commander-in-chief, one has
to wonder if the theme song for this operation comes from the score
of `Braveheart' or `Wag the Dog.'''
</P>
<P>
   However, Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan
Brookings Institution who has often criticized Clinton, said, ``I
don't feel particularly cynical about this. We just have to give
the president the benefit of the doubt.''

COMMENTARY: ISN'T IT RICH? AREN'T THEY A PAIR?  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RUSSELL BAKER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I have been watching the most powerful country on earth making
an ass of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Something like this appeared in The London Daily Mirror in 1954,
written by a columnist who had been sent over to cover the
Army-McCarthy hearings.
</P>
<P>
   It's a wonderful lead, stating the facts precisely in one crisp
sentence and remaining durable through the ages. It fits the
present moment to perfection.
</P>
<P>
   What, for example, could be more exquisitely trivial than the
questions we now hear about the president's body language? You
noticed, of course, that while walking to a helicopter his hand was
held not by Mrs. Clinton, but by his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   You know what this means, if it means anything, and whether it
means anything or not the media insist that you put down your
coffee and ponder it. There may be clues in this hand matter, clues
about Mrs. Clinton's emotions.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there may not be clues, but that's important
too, isn't it? Imagine the headline scoop with which the grocery
tabloids might humiliate great networks and newspapers: ``Vital
Clues Missing.'' ``Clinton's Hand Everywhere but Fingerprints
Nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the mystery of the haberdashery signals. That
necktie the president wore _ it was given to him by Monica
Lewinsky. And you know what Sources say; to wit, that by wearing
that necktie he may have been communicating a message to Ms.
Lewinsky. Yes, Sources say that.
</P>
<P>
   So what was he saying that day when, as the pictures show, he
wore that very necktie? Was he sending necktie signals?
</P>
<P>
   And why necktie signals? Why not smoke signals? Maybe Ms.
Lewinsky can't read smoke signals. Maybe Linda Tripp has equipment
that lets her tape smoke signals. If so, will the Supreme Court let
taped smoke signals be admitted as evidence?
</P>
<P>
   All right, let's calm down and examine the meaning of the
unusual intervention of the president's dog Buddy. As an old media
hack with long experience of beasts and politicians, I always smell
nasty work afoot when a politician grants a dog equal display with
his own ego.
</P>
<P>
   Until Clinton's uncontrite speech of contrition Monday night,
Buddy had been kept in low-profile mode. Next day, when the news
industry announced that the speech wouldn't do, lo and behold!
there is the president leading Buddy around the Martha's Vineyard
airport during a 20-minute arrival ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Watching dog and president on TV, I caught myself briefly
wondering about the collapse of the Russian economy. Might some
desperate Russian be tempted to put food on the table by selling a
few old H-bombs to rich Middle East malcontents?
</P>
<P>
   Well, H-bombs, the real world _ who cares? The fascinating
question is not whether we can survive, but whether the president
can survive. What do Sources say?
</P>
<P>
   I'm not referring to Irv and Madge Sources, who used to provide
me with foreign-policy leaks when I covered the State Department,
nor to Nick (Unimpeachable) Sources, their son and heir who turned
peach-able and fled to Brazil to avoid being blackballed at the
National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
   Having fled Washington myself to avoid the journalist's daily
duty to be solemn about events of absolutely no consequence, I am
forbidden to meet the Sources who keep America up to date on
presidential bodily fluids and DNA samples, but sources close to
the Sources tell me ...
</P>
<P>
   Well, never mind. On to the murderous Starr-Clinton
relationship. After watching Clinton turn his contrition speech
into an attack on Starr, people who have followed this governmental
burlesque tell me that for the first time they feel sympathy for
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Starr is half-mad with the need to nail this slippery
piece of human Jell-O to the wall, they say. The president is like
Bugs Bunny forever tormenting Elmer Fudd to the edge of madness.
Bunny constantly taunts poor Fudd by insolently demonstrating that
Fudd cannot lay a glove on him.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with gall on the heroic scale, Clinton announces that while
he may have behaved badly with Ms. Lewinsky, it's Starr who is to
blame for all the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Send in the clowns? Don't bother, they're here.

MISSILES USED IN STRIKES HAVE IMPROVED GUIDANCE SYSTEMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Tomahawk cruise missiles that struck Afghanistan
and Sudan Thursday are much more likely to hit their targets than
the Tomahawks of just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1991 Gulf War, according to the official postmortem
studies by the US Defense Intelligence Agency, only about half the
cruise missiles even got close to their targets _ and fewer still
achieved destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the older Tomahawks is that their guidance
system relied entirely on sensors that compared key features of the
terrain, over which the missile would fly, with a pre-programmed
radar-map of the flightpath. Most of Iraq is flat; the terrain has
few distinctive features. And so, back then, the Tomahawks _ which
have a range of 700 miles _ often got lost on the way to their
destination.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's attack _ which reportedly involved at least 75 cruise
missiles fired from the Arabian and Red Seas _ was probably more
successful for two reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, Afghanistan and Sudan have more distinctive geological
features that the Tomahawk guidance system can more easily follow.
</P>
<P>
   Second, and more important, the newest version of Tomahawks,
costing about $750,000 each, are guided not only by terrain-radar
but also by Global Positioning Satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Many cars these days have GPS-receivers that, hooked up to a
map, let drivers know where they are and where they are going. The
principle of GPS-guided weapons systems is much the same.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the technicians who program a missile's flight path
do not need to worry about following distinctive terrain. They
simply plug in the coordinates of the target _ and the missile can
be programmed to take any number of paths.
</P>
<P>
   The Tomahawk's warhead explodes with the force of 1,000 pounds
of TNT _ not terribly destructive _ but the barrage of Thursday's
attack should have assured great damage, even allowing for the
possibility of some wayward weapons.
</P>
<P>
   John Pike, weapons specialist at the Federation of American
Scientists, calculated that _ based on known data about satellite
orbits _ a USA-116 Keyhole spy-satellite flew over Afghanistan 45
minutes after Thursday's attack. Another satellite passed over
shortly after that.
</P>
<P>
   The Keyhole, which has optical sensors that see in the dark,
could have taken and transmitted photographs before and after the
attack, allowing analysts to tell how much damage was done.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Texas president of the National Organization for
Women joined some local clergy members and others Thursday in
criticizing the Promise Keepers organization, which is starting a
conference Friday night in the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   NOW and others will protest the event at 5 p.m., CDT, Saturday,
said Houston attorney Jeanne Sommerfeld.
</P>
<P>
   Promise Keepers, a ``Christian outreach for men,'' was founded
by former University of Colorado football coach Bill McCartney. Its
emotional rallies fill sports stadiums nationwide, featuring men of
all races praying together, confessing their failings, and
promising to be better husbands and fathers.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with that, said Sommerfeld and the pastors, is that
the aims are promoted through an intolerant fundamentalism that
subordinates women, oppresses homosexuals and promotes right-wing
political aims.
</P>
<P>
   Promise Keepers, a Denver-based group, urges men to make seven
promises, including ``practicing spiritual, moral, ethical and
sexual purity'' and ``building strong marriages and families
through love, protection and biblical values.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sommerfeld challenged the organization to answer seven
questions, including explaining its alleged disrespect toward
women, political agenda, anti-gay stance and funding sources.
</P>
<P>
   Promise Keepers literature says the group is politically
neutral, but Sommerfeld cited McCartney's vows to ``take back the
nation for Christ'' and to ``contend for the truth'' in ``schools
and the legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   A NOW handout said McCartney also worked for a Colorado
referendum to deny gays and lesbians protection from
discrimination. The resulting amendment was ruled unconstitutional
by the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Promise Keepers' official statements say homosexual behavior is
a sin but that gays are welcome to attend the group's events and
seek God's forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   While Sommerfeld acknowledged that Promise Keepers does not
condone wife abuse or seek to deprive women of legal rights, she
said these results could be a ``logical consequence'' of a
subordinate role.
</P>
<P>
   While Promise Keepers promotes apostle Paul's teaching that
women should ``submit'' to their husbands, the group also exhorts
husbands to cherish and protect their wives.
</P>
<P>
   The organization reported that its rallies at 22 stadiums in
1996 drew 1.1 million men. In 1997 it had a staff of 452 and a
budget of about $117 million.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Others speaking against the rally included ministers Bob
Schaibly of First Unitarian Universalist Church, where the press
conference was held, Bruce Prescott of Easthaven Baptist Church and
Carolyn Mobley of Metropolitan Community Church of Resurrection,
and former ministers Don Sinclair and Wes Seeliger.

HOSPITAL LICENSES DRUG-DEVELOPMENT PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHANA R. SCHOENBERGER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center has licensed a new
drug development process to Consensus Pharmaceuticals Inc., a
Boston &UR;  &LR; company formed this week to market the technology.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Consensus, which is backed by venture capital
financing of $4 million to $7 million, marks the first time the
hospital has taken an equity stake in a spinoff company involving
BI-Deaconess research.
</P>
<P>
   The new company's shareholders include the hospital, Interwest
Partners of Menlo Park, Calif., and Axiom Venture Partners, based
in Hartford, Conn. Interwest holds the biggest stake.
</P>
<P>
   Consensus plans to hire about 30 employees in its first year,
according to managing director Arnold L. Oronsky.
</P>
<P>
   Consensus will contract with drug companies to screen hundreds
of millions of molecules for possible reaction with a protein, gene
or cell, allowing manufacturers to develop new drugs in far less
time than traditional drug-screening methods require, investors
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appeared to me that it literally cut years off the
process,'' said Dr. Linda D. Sonntag, an Axiom general partner, of
Consensus's technology.
</P>
<P>
   BI-Deaconess researcher Dr. Lewis Cantley, who developed the
process, will serve on the company's scientific advisory board and
work as a consultant for Consensus. The company's management will
be made up of outside businesspeople rather than people affiliated
with the hospital , according to Mark Chalek, director of corporate
research at BI-Deaconess.
</P>
<P>
   Consensus hopes to line up several contracts with pharmaceutical
companies over the next few months, Chalek said. In addition to
contract work for drug companies, Consensus will also develop its
own drugs using its technology, Oronsky said.
</P>
<P>
   After a merger created BI-Deaconess 18 months ago, the hospital
hired Chalek to investigate ways to spin off the hospital's
research through startup companies or licenses to existing firms,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   While hospitals in other regions often take equity positions in
companies formed to market their research, Boston-area medical
centers are only beginning to do so, Chalek said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston tends to somewhat of a more conservative community,''
he said. ``As more and more of these have been done over the years
and institutions have realized it's a beneficial way to transfer
technology, it's becoming more usual.''

 &HT;    AFGHANISTAN: WHERE IT IS, WHAT IT'S LIKE

   WASHINGTON _ Not many people in Afghanistan's capital will be
able to see the effects of the U.S. attack on facilities in their
country on television.
</P>
<P>
   After a warning period expired, Islamic morality squads from the
Taliban movement, which controls most of the country, that controls
most of Afghanistan began this month to move through the streets,
stores and workplaces of Kabul smashing all the TV sets they could
find.
</P>
<P>
   ``These means of corruption were in some places even thrown out
of the windows of high buildings to smash on the streets below,'' a
local newspaper reported. The Taliban announced on radio (which is
still legal) that it will supply the morality squads with uniforms
and armbands, so that people will be able to tell them from the
country's many bands of unauthorized freelance thugs.
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan is a poor, mountainous, landlocked country with the
bad luck to be right in the middle of the best land route between
Europe and Asia. The target of more powerful nations for centuries,
its many tribes and political factions joined together to throw out
the latest occupation force, which came from the Soviet Union, in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   The civil war that broke out among the Afghan victors continues,
despite recent efforts by Americans and other outsiders to work out
a peace agreement. The Taliban, a fundamentalist Islamist movement,
has controlled Kabul and the southern two-thirds of Afghanistan for
nearly 23 months -- but by no means controls everything that goes
on within that part.
</P>
<P>
   Taliban's generals frequently announce victories against other
Afghans in the north, but the civil war never seems to end.
</P>
<P>
   The International Red Cross fed more than 3,700 families last
week in Kabul, where the Taliban won't let women take paying jobs
outside their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other things to keep in mind:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Government: At the top of Taliban, the closest thing
Afghanistan has to a government, is the president, Lt. Gen. Omar
Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir. There is no legislative branch and
religious courts handle judicial activity.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Neighbors: Afghanistan is surrounded by Pakistan to the east
and south, Iran to the west and China and three former Soviet
republics -- Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan -- to its
North.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Size: 647,500 square kilometers , slightly smaller than Texas.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Population: Around 28 million, twice Florida's.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ethnic groups: Pashtun 38 percent; Tajik 25 percent; Hazara 19
percent; Uzbek 6 percent; plus others.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Languages: Many Afghanis are bilingual. The first language for
about half is an Afghan version of Persian, the language of
neighboring Iran. Most of the rest speak Uzbek, Turkmen or another
Turkic language.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Life expectancy: The average woman has a life expectancy of 47
years; the average man lives 46 years.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Religion: Virtually everybody is a Muslim, with about 85
percent Sunni and the rest Shi'ite.

SIMMS FINDS STEADY HOME WITH RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Some baseball players are born to greatness.
Others have Tucson thrust upon them. Mike Simms is Mr. Tucson. He
is to the Tucson Toros what Crash Davis (or Kevin Costner) was to
the Durham Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Just call him the Babe Ruth of southern Arizona, the Toros'
all-time leader with 79 home runs and 376 runs batted in. He's also
second all-time with 1,878 excruciating at-bats, some of them taken
while wondering if Tucson would be the end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard about it, Mayor of Tucson, things like that,'' Simms
said. ``I liked it there, it was a good place to play. But you
never want to spend a significant amount of time in Triple A.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms has, over each of the past eight seasons. Tucson was home
for six of those seasons, but there also was a year in Las Vegas, a
quick stay in Oklahoma City and one horrible month in Buffalo,
N.Y., five years ago. That stop appeared to be the end of the line,
but instead proved to be a life-changing experience.
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of being out of baseball, Simms suddenly has found
himself playing regularly for the Rangers, the second-best
offensive team in the American League. That might change when Lee
Stevens comes off the disabled list, but it does appear Simms, 14
years after being drafted by the Houston Astros, will make it
through an entire season without playing in the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``When somebody brings that up, I think to myself, knock on
wood,'' Simms said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rangers manager Johnny Oates said, ``As long as he keeps
hitting, I'm not going to take him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms entered the Rangers' homestand that started Wednesday
hitting .343 in his past 38 games, and his ratio of one home run
for every 10.0 at-bats, through Wednesday's game, was the
second-best of any player in the majors with at least 100 at-bats.
First is St. Louis' Mark McGwire. Simms only has had 140 at-bats,
which keeps him out of the Roger Maris chase. But it's still a
career-high.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been asking me, is this your chance against
right-handers,'' said Simms, who was platooning at designated
hitter before Stevens was injured. ``But I haven't heard anything
from Johnny. We've got Lee out and Juan \RGonzalez\S has been
day-to-day. Things can change quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I look at _ and it may sound boring _ is
hopefully I can put some good at-bats together no matter what. If
there is a runner on second, get him over to third. If he's on
third, hit a ground ball or fly ball. If I got 0-for-4 but still do
something to help my team win, then I'm happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Oates, ``No. 1, he's a hard worker. We have a joke among
the staff when we talk about early batting practice. We always say,
`who, besides Simms, is going to be there.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Simms did not always have such a rosy outlook on life. He was
once a top prospect for the Houston Astros, but he also was a
player who put too much pressure on himself _ at least when he
wasn't out on the town carousing _ and blew his cool when those
expectations weren't fulfilled regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could break the bats and tear up the water coolers with the
best of them,'' Simms said. ``Some of my off-the-field habits and
things I pursued also may have held me back. At times, I got a
little wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Astros general manager Bill Wood said Simms was signed
right out of high school and ``he had to do his growing up and
maturing in the minor leagues. That's not easy for a handsome
strapping player like him. I'm sure he had additional difficulties
other than learning the game and coping with the pressures and
making the adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms also had to contend with Jeff Bagwell. He lost that
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Simms was the Astros' sixth-round pick in 1985. By 1991, he had
progressed to the point where he was ready to be their regular
first baseman. It was his job to lose in spring training after
Glenn Davis was traded to the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Simms lost it. He had a mediocre spring, and the Astros had
moved Bagwell from third base, where Ken Caminiti was anchored, to
first base. Bagwell has gone on to become perhaps the greatest
player in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Simms had to settle for the same honor in Tucson for the next
two years, then wandered to the San Diego Padres' organization. He
started 1994 with the Pittsburgh Pirates' organization, but was
released at Buffalo after a month.
</P>
<P>
   He said that was the lowest point of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty devastating on your self-esteem, when a team
says you can't play,'' Simms said. ``You think what I'm going to do
now.''
</P>
<P>
   What Simms did was pray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been trying to do everything my way, and things didn't
work out,'' Simms said. ``Finally, I let it go. I said, `Lord, if
you want me to play baseball, I will, if not, I'll go do something
else.' I left it in his hands. When I did that, it was like a
burden was lifted off my shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I don't get upset anymore when I don't help the
team win, but I'm able to handle it better. I have more
self-confidence. I come to the park with a routine, I prepare
myself for the game and do the best I can. If I do that, I can look
at myself in the mirror after the game and feel good about
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The attitude has made Simms a better person, but it has not
created miracles. He is still a role player. He is not Jeff
Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no more smashed bats or trashed water coolers, or
plane tickets out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Tucson is fading in the rearview mirror.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Osama bin Muhammad bin Awad Bin Laden is the
self-appointed president of a University of Holy War in
Afghanistan, U.S. officials say.
</P>
<P>
   From his Afghan redoubt, he has declared war against U.S.
interests everywhere, fueled by rage against U.S. power in the
Middle East, and backed, the officials say, by an international
network of terrorists and companies.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago he moved his base from Sudan, where he lived from
1991 to 1996, forming a close alliance with that nation's most
powerful man: Hassan Turabi. The leader of Sudan's ruling party,
the National Islamic Front, Turabi saw himself as the Grand Vizier
of Islam, the leading voice for Islamic fundamentalism in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden has saved his strongest anger for U.S. forces and U.S.
allies in his homeland, Saudi Arabia. This year, he publicly warned
that American civilians were his targets as well. Thursday, the
United States made war on him and his Sudanese allies.
</P>
<P>
   Just a decade ago, the United States considered bin Laden
himself as an ally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew him as one of the Saudi benefactors who took care of
widows and orphans'' of the U.S.-backed Afghan rebels who fought
off Soviet invaders in the 1980s, said a retired U.S. official who
helped fight that long battle.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden spent millions supporting the Afghan guerrillas,
financing thousands of volunteer foreign soldiers who came to
Afghanistan from throughout the Islamic world, and creating a
network of guest houses and charities to support them and their
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a common cause with the United States,'' said Zalmay
Khalilzad, a former State Department and Pentagon official of
Afghan descent who monitored the war. ``But with the end of the
Soviet occupation in 1989, his struggle became the struggle against
the United States, the dominant power in the world and in the
Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden returned to his native Saudi Arabia in 1989, and began
to support militant Islamic groups opposing moderate Islamic
governments.
</P>
<P>
   His rage against the United States took root during the 1991
Gulf war, with the continuing presence of U.S. troops on the sands
of his native Saudi Arabia. ``He regarded that as an occupation of
the Islamic holy places by the United States,'' Khalilzad said, and
bin Laden swore vengeance against what he called ``the crusaders''
of Christianity trespassing on Mecca and Medina.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this man thinks about every day is: How do I get the U.S.
out of my home in Saudi Arabia, and how do I get those corrupt
pharaohs out of power?'' said Kenneth Katzman, a former CIA analyst
who is the Congressional Research service's resident expert on
Middle Eastern terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden's views are shared by Turabi, whose bond with bin
Laden helped place the Sudan on the United States' short list of
state sponsors of international terrorism, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bin Laden is inspired by Turabi's expansive vision; he sees
eye to eye with him,'' Katzman said. ``They are allies. They are
close associates. They are business partners. Bin Laden is Turabi's
alter ego, his field commander, his operations chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Several intelligence analysts noted Thursday that the U.S.
Embassy in Sudan was all but evacuated in 1996, following a
terrorist threat _ and relocated at the U.S. Embassy in Kenya,
which was bombed on August 7, along with the U.S. Embassy in
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses _ and fronts for terrorism _ established by bin Laden
in the Sudan in the early 1990s continue to flourish. The National
Islamic Front is a financial partner in bin Laden's import-export,
agricultural cooperative, construction and Islamic banking
businesses based in and around Khartoum, the capital of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bin Laden has made financial contributions to the Sudanese
military-industrial complex,'' a senior U.S. intelligence official
said Thursday, ``of which, we believe, the Shifa pharmaceutical
facility is part.'' That plant was attacked by the United States on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 and 1992, bin Laden gave jobs in the Sudan to hundreds
of his proteges, veterans of the Afghan war who had come from
across northern Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. These
veterans became the core of an international network. They started
looking for new worlds to conquer.
</P>
<P>
   They told each other: ``We have a British grave in Afghanistan.
We have a Soviet grave. And then we will have an American grave,''
said a politically moderate Afghan veteran commander, Abdul Haq.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, a skilled construction engineer, began working to
build that grave.
</P>
<P>
   He went to work trying to form ``a multinational organization
for jihad, to purge the world of Western corrupters and their Arab
friends,'' a U.S. intelligence official said. Jihad is the Arabic
word for holy war.
</P>
<P>
   His goal, said the official, was ``a stateless, global jihad
without borders,'' and with his millions, he aimed to build ``a
huge alliance of like-minded groups.''
</P>
<P>
   He became the world's leading individual sponsor of terrorism
against Americans, spending a large part of the $250 million
fortune he inherited from his father, who built palaces, mosques
and public works for the Saudi royal family. That money went to
help create a global network of armed fundamentalists, backed by
businesses and banks that functioned as front organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a very intricate financial infrastructure,'' said a
senior U.S. intelligence official. ``He has networks on every
continent almost. He has an infrastructure that's very, very
replete with capability, people, money.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, United States intelligence agencies have tried
to track bin Laden and have compiled a chronology of his career,
including these highlights:
</P>
<P>
   In December 1992, his operatives tried to bomb a hotel in Aden,
Yemen, where 100 U.S. soldiers were billeted en route to support
United Nations peacekeeping operations in Somalia. The job was
botched; two Australian tourists were killed.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1993 came the World Trade Center bombing in New
York. No concrete evidence ties bin Laden's followers to that
attack, but Pakistani intelligence officials say Ramzi Ahmed
Yousef, the convicted mastermind of the bombing, spent most of the
following three years until his arrest at a guest house called the
House of Martyrs in Peshawar, Pakistan, which was owned by bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1993, bin Laden channeled tens of millions of
dollars a year through Islamic banks and charities to terrorist
organizations, militant groups and extremist political movements
based in Egypt, Algeria, Yemen, Sudan, Lebanon, and the
Philippines, as well as providing support for the shadowy and
stateless group known as Islamic Jihad, U.S. officials say. He has
also claimed to support Islamic movements in Bosnia, Kashmir,
Tajikistan, Chechnya and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   By January 1994, bin Laden had established at least three
terrorist camps in the Sudan, where rebels from a half-dozen
different nations received training and shelter, according to U.S.
intelligence analysts. And by 1995, bin Laden's businesses and
training camps in the Sudan had provided safe haven to radical
followers who had then fanned out over the Islamic world, from
North Africa, across the Middle East, to South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1996, under intense pressure from the United States,
Sudan expelled bin Laden, hoping to receive U.S. economic
assistance. It never came. He returned to Afghanistan, where he
received political protection and support from the Taliban, the
armed religious extremist group that now controls much of
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   He has been living in Afghanistan, first outside Jalalabad, then
outside Khandahar, ever since. He established at least two sets of
terrorist training camps in that war-shattered land: the biggest,
near the provincial capital of Khost, was bombed by the United
States on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad were located in the Khost
camp, including their leader, Ayman el-Zawahri, who is wanted for
terrorism in Egypt. So were members of the Islamic Group, which
assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrorists of various nationalities have trained there,'' a
senior intelligence official said Thursday. ``This is the largest
Sunni terrorist training facility in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden is thought to have, at minimum, a supporting role in
the bombing of two U.S. military installations in Saudi Arabia that
killed a total of 24 Americans in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He hardly disavowed it; in a February 1997 interview, he said:
``We had thought that the Riyadh and al-Khobar blasts were a
sufficient signal to sensible U.S. decision-makers to avert a real
battle between the Islamic nation and U.S. forces, but it seems
they did not understand the signal.''
</P>
<P>
   On August 6, the day before the bombings of the U.S. embassies
in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, the Egyptian Jihad group sent the
United States a warning: They would soon deliver a message to
Americans ``which we hope they read with care, because we will
write it, with God's help, in a language they will understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the United States replied in kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a war,'' Khalilzad said. ``They did two bombings, we
did two, in two different countries, two different targets. If the
targets associated with bin Laden were destroyed, there will be
some effect on his ability to do things. Whatever plans he may have
had in place, whether those will be affected by the attacks, we
can't tell. Whether his organization will be deterred, who knows.
But this is a strong message to those people who thought they could
remain beyond the reach of civilized law in the anarchy of
Afghanistan.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the man in charge of the camps was reported by
his followers in Afghanistan to have survived, making it likely
that his violent dialogue with the United States would continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know where bin Laden is,'' a senior intelligence
official said, adding: ``The prospect of retaliation against
Americans is very, very high.''

 &QL; 
HILLARY (Undated) - Women's rights advocates around the nation seem
to be worried that Hillary Rodham Clinton's continuing gracious
attitude toward her husband's infidelity is the attitude of
submission and repression, opposite of what a women's role model
should be projecting. By failing to react in a way that most women

HEPATITIS (Undated) - Little did they know that intravenous drug
use, tattoos and body piercing would be an invitation to a
slow-growing virus that would eventually become the recently

variety inflames the liver, causing debilitating symptoms or, even
more frightening, virtually no symptoms at all until the disease is

SPICEGIRL (Undated) - Thanks to the burly British accent, the voice
on the other end of the line is hard to understand. Still, the
words are unmistakable. ``Hello! This is Mel B. from the Spice
Girls! How are you doing today?'' At that moment, it suddenly kicks
in: Millions of 9-year-old girls around the world would trade
places with me in an instant. It's a heady feeling, actually.
Still, the reality of it is that I'm on the phone with Melanie

   I hear there's an opening, and that the Pre-Fab Four need a

because Scary Spice was picking on her. I'm a shoo-in.
</P>
<P>
   I already know what my Spice Girl focus is going to be.
Considering that I already had boobs and acne by the time the rest
of the Spice Girls were about to be born, I'll be known as Old
Spice. I'll set the other Spicies straight by informing them that
``girl power'' never meant anything more than their perky cup size,

their boobs have dropped, they've purchased a power tool and have
started growing hairs out of their chins. By LAURI NOTARO. Story

DANCE-MOVIE (Undated) - It's a bit of ``Saturday Night Fever,`` a

RAT PACK-BEACH BOYS (Undated) - A preview of ``The Rat Pack`` on

   The new G20, like the former model, hits the mark in many

   ATTACK-BINLADEN (Washington) _ How Osama bin Laden, the youngest
son of a construction magnate from Yemen, became the world's most
feared sponsor of terrorism. The religious and ideological roots of
his rage lie in the 1980s, when he worked side by side with the CIA
backing the Afghan rebels. When that battle was over, he and his

   ATTACK-CONGRESS (Washington) _ The most cherished axiom of
American diplomacy is that politics stops at the water's edge,
meaning that the opposition party supports the president when
missiles are flying. Today it worked, more or less. The bulk of
congressional leaders, from Speaker Newt Gingrich to such reliable
Clinton critics as Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, rallied
around the commander-in-chief, with Gingrich declaring: ``I think
based on what I know that it was the right thing to do at the right

<TEXT>
<P>
   NICOSIA _ Carrying out President Bill Clinton's promise of dire
punishment of the bombers of U.S. embassies in Africa once again
raises the old ghost of the CIA's war against the Soviets in
Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989. It also involves major trouble for
old allies in that war.
</P>
<P>
   The chief suspect thus far in the assaults on the two embassies
is the Saudi construction tycoon Osama bin Laden, 45, who was
described in the early 1990s as a mastermind of international
terrorism by the U.S. State Department and other Western agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The rhetoric used in claims and near-claims of the bombings,
signed by an ``Islamic Army for the Liberation of the Muslim Holy
places'' or ``The Exiles,'' is virtually identical to bin Laden's
fiery declarations of war against America.
</P>
<P>
   The claims have to come either from him, from his disciples (the
few reporters who have visited him in his Sudanese and later Afghan
lairs estimate their number at about 3,000) or from someone wanting
to put the blame on him.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi multimillionaire, despite disavowals of him by his
family, probably has additional billions at his disposal from the
bin Laden construction firms, a Saudi business and engineering
empire with global reach. This gives him unlimited financial
resources.
</P>
<P>
   He put these at the disposal of the CIA and Pakistan during
their 10-year war to evict the Russians in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   With such resources, bin Laden and his acolytes can continue to
recruit and finance terrorists everywhere, including the likes of
the 1993 World Trade Center bombers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden has been the well-protected guest of the Taleban, the
Muslim zealots now overwhelming Afghanistan. The Taleban have
condemned the embassy bombings. They say they have warned bin Laden
not to proclaim holy war from Afghan territory.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since their appearance as fiercely austere ``students''
opposing the corruption and banditry of local Afghan warlords and
their conquest of Kabul in the mid-1990s, the Taleban have had
supply, training and political support from Pakistan's intelligence
service.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, Russia and governments of nearby ex-Soviet Muslim
republics such as Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan fear
that, feeling flush with current victories, the Taleban's Islamist
warriors _ who deny women schooling and skilled jobs, and enforce
medieval punishments for everything from adultery to inadequately
long men's beards _ may send ideology as well as soldiers abroad in
a jihad across the South and Central Asian borders.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, the CIA's companion-in-arms in the Afghan conflict,
which was the largest covert American operation since the wars in
Vietnam and Laos, is accused, possibly justly, of now lending
support by regular Pakistani military forces to the Taleban.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan vehemently denies this. However, it has long been clear
that Pakistan wants the Taleban to prevail over its Afghan foes.
Islamabad wants to control trade and energy routes between the
Indian Ocean and Central Asia. Despite Iranian, Russian and Indian
support, those Afghan foes are now on the run.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia, the main ally of the United States in the Muslim
world, has been financing the Taleban since their appearance, just
as it financed their immediate predecessors and godfathers, the
Afghan mujahidin who fought Russians and are now fighting their own
governments and societies, from Egypt and Algeria to the
Philippines and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Washington policymakers must consider the price that
is still being paid for their anti-Communist alliance with Muslim
extremists during the previous generation, especially in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   If the Taleban do not abandon bin Laden, could the United States
send air cover and strong special forces to break Taleban
resistance and arrest him or his followers, against opposition from
their Pakistani and Saudi allies?
</P>
<P>
   Could the Clinton administration sell to the U.S. Congress and
American public a reversal of alliances?
</P>
<P>
   It would mean opposing, at least temporarily, Pakistan and Saudi
Arabia, and joining instead the anti-Taleban coalition of Iran,
India, Russia and Russia's former Islamic subject states of Central
Asia, and perhaps igniting new conflicts. &QL;

ADVERTISING: RISING TENSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The relationship between agencies and advertisers is
deteriorating, according to an annual survey, after two years of
results that had begun to narrow a yawning chasm between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had seen some real improvements, but this year the
advertisers and agencies are starting to fall out again,'' said
Nancy Salz, president of Nancy L. Salz Consulting in New York, who
offered a preview of the findings of the 1998 Salz Survey of
Advertiser-Agency Relations.
</P>
<P>
   The surveys for 1996 and 1997 had brought surprisingly better
responses from executives at agencies and client companies when
asked about the nature of their relations. But that era of good
feelings proved brief, much to Ms. Salz's dismay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't expecting that,'' Ms. Salz said, referring to the
conclusions of the 1998 survey.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which has been conducted for the last 13 years, is
significant because what advertisers and agencies think and feel
about each other strongly influences their ability to work
together. That in turn can profoundly affect the quality and
effectiveness of the campaigns that are aimed at consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to stay focused on the advertising,'' Ms. Salz
said, ``but it's very, very easy to lose that focus.'' Indeed,
advertisers responding to the survey said that if they could
consistently obtain the best work from their agencies, their sales
would increase by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Half the agency executives who replied to the survey said that
there was increased tension in the relationship with their major
clients. That figure was at its highest level since 1994. At the
same time, 30 percent of the executives at client companies said
that there was increased tension in the relationship with their
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Both agencies and advertisers also told of frustrations with the
process by which ads are produced. Asked if in the last year there
were more or fewer hassles (to use the wording of the question)
than previously, 45 percent of agencies, and 25 percent of
advertisers, answered by saying there were more.
</P>
<P>
   And there were sharp differences in the responses to a question
about whether there was more or less teamwork in the agency-client
relationship. Sixty-four percent of advertisers said that there was
more teamwork, a record figure for that response. Five percent said
that there was less teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   When agencies were asked the same question, only 36 percent said
that there was more teamwork. Thirty-two percent said that there
was less teamwork, a record figure for that response.
</P>
<P>
   The primary reason for the reversal of fortune in the survey,
Ms. Salz said, was ``the extraordinary pressure on advertisers to
increase earnings to justify stock value.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As the bull market goes on, those pressures are even
greater,'' she added. ``So what clients demand of their agencies
causes the tensions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both advertisers and agencies agree that the agencies have
responded well to the pressure,'' Ms. Salz said, ``and are more
focused on their clients' needs. However, they do not agree how
well their relationship is going.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, Ms. Salz said, survey responses from advertisers were
more optimistic than those from their agencies. That's an
interesting twist to the widespread perception that Madison Avenue
is replete with preternatural Pollyannas.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salz said she did not believe that the continuing turmoil in
agency account assignments, as marketers frenetically hire and fire
shops, contributed to the souring of client-agency relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's an issue any more so than in the past,''
she said, citing the fact that account turnover had been
particularly pronounced in 1996 and 1997 as the relationship
between advertisers and agencies was deemed to be improving.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what clients and agencies can do, Ms. Salz suggested that
they ``set the highest possible standards and insist up front on
only the best,'' because they ``agree that's the most important
thing you can do to create or get terrific work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easier said than done,'' Ms. Salz acknowledged,
especially in such fields as telecommunications, which ``change so
fast, there is no time'' to ``want great advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   And quality is frequently a runnerup to productivity, Ms. Salz
said, particularly now that technology enables work to be produced
faster.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers and agencies must remember, she added, that ``ideas
are still created the old-fashioned way, in people's minds and
emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted in April for Salz Consulting by Thurm
Marketing and Consulting Inc. in Princeton, N.J. Salz Consulting
sponsors training seminars in agency relations and advertising
development for marketers like Clorox Co. and IBM Corp.

   NICOSIA _ Carrying out President Bill Clinton's promise of dire
punishment of the bombers of U.S. embassies in Africa once again
raises the old ghost of the CIA's war against the Soviets in
Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989. It also involves major trouble for
old allies in that war.
</P>
<P>
   The chief suspect thus far in the assaults on the two embassies
is the Saudi construction tycoon Osama bin Laden, 45, who was
described in the early 1990s as a mastermind of international
terrorism by the U.S. State Department and other Western agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The rhetoric used in claims and near-claims of the bombings,
signed by an ``Islamic Army for the Liberation of the Muslim Holy
places'' or ``The Exiles,'' is virtually identical to bin Laden's
fiery declarations of war against America.
</P>
<P>
   The claims have to come either from him, from his disciples (the
few reporters who have visited him in his Sudanese and later Afghan
lairs estimate their number at about 3,000) or from someone wanting
to put the blame on him.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi multimillionaire, despite disavowals of him by his
family, probably has additional billions at his disposal from the
bin Laden construction firms, a Saudi business and engineering
empire with global reach. This gives him unlimited financial
resources.
</P>
<P>
   He put these at the disposal of the CIA and Pakistan during
their 10-year war to evict the Russians in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   With such resources, bin Laden and his acolytes can continue to
recruit and finance terrorists everywhere, including the likes of
the 1993 World Trade Center bombers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden has been the well-protected guest of the Taleban, the
Muslim zealots now overwhelming Afghanistan. The Taleban have
condemned the embassy bombings. They say they have warned bin Laden
not to proclaim holy war from Afghan territory.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since their appearance as fiercely austere ``students''
opposing the corruption and banditry of local Afghan warlords and
their conquest of Kabul in the mid-1990s, the Taleban have had
supply, training and political support from Pakistan's intelligence
service.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, Russia and governments of nearby ex-Soviet Muslim
republics such as Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan fear
that, feeling flush with current victories, the Taleban's Islamist
warriors _ who deny women schooling and skilled jobs, and enforce
medieval punishments for everything from adultery to inadequately
long men's beards _ may send ideology as well as soldiers abroad in
a jihad across the South and Central Asian borders.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, the CIA's companion-in-arms in the Afghan conflict,
which was the largest covert American operation since the wars in
Vietnam and Laos, is accused, possibly justly, of now lending
support by regular Pakistani military forces to the Taleban.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan vehemently denies this. However, it has long been clear
that Pakistan wants the Taleban to prevail over its Afghan foes.
Islamabad wants to control trade and energy routes between the
Indian Ocean and Central Asia. Despite Iranian, Russian and Indian
support, those Afghan foes are now on the run.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia, the main ally of the United States in the Muslim
world, has been financing the Taleban since their appearance, just
as it financed their immediate predecessors and godfathers, the
Afghan mujahidin who fought Russians and are now fighting their own
governments and societies, from Egypt and Algeria to the
Philippines and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Washington policymakers must consider the price that
is still being paid for their anti-Communist alliance with Muslim
extremists during the previous generation, especially in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   If the Taleban do not abandon bin Laden, could the United States
send air cover and strong special forces to break Taleban
resistance and arrest him or his followers, against opposition from
their Pakistani and Saudi allies?
</P>
<P>
   Could the Clinton administration sell to the U.S. Congress and
American public a reversal of alliances?
</P>
<P>
   It would mean opposing, at least temporarily, Pakistan and Saudi
Arabia, and joining instead the anti-Taleban coalition of Iran,
India, Russia and Russia's former Islamic subject states of Central
Asia, and perhaps igniting new conflicts. &QL;

BASEBALL'S TOP 10 FAMILIES 
WITH BASEBALL EXTRA PACKAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. Waner _ Paul ``Big Poison'' and Lloyd ``Little Poison'' Waner
played side-by-side in the Pirates' outfield for 13 years. Paul had
a career batting average of .333; Lloyd hit .316. They are the only
two players from the same family in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   2. Alou _ On Sept. 15, 1963, the San Francisco Giants had an
outfield of Jesus, Felipe and Matty Alou. All three had good
careers as solid-hitting outfielders. Matty won a batting title in
1966 with the Pirates. Felipe is an excellent manager with the
Expos, and his son, Moises Alou, is an All-Star with the Astros.
Felipe is also the uncle of Mets reliever Mel Rojas.
</P>
<P>
   3. DiMaggio _ There were three brothers from San Francisco,
including Joe, one of the greatest players ever. Dom, who played
for the Boston Red Sox, was almost as good as his brother, but
didn't have his power. Vince, who played for the Pirates, was the
Pete Incaviglia of his time, often leading the league in
strikeouts. He could have been a great opera singer.
</P>
<P>
   4. Boone _ A three-generation All-Star family starting with Ray
Boone, a shortstop with the Indians and Tigers. His son Bob won
seven Gold Gloves as a catcher, and grandson, Bret, was an All-Star
second baseman for the Reds this year. Bret's brother Aaron is also
with the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   5. MacPhail _ They never played, but they had huge impacts as
executives. Larry MacPhail was the original architect of the great
Dodgers dynasty while introducing night baseball and games
broadcast on radio. His son, Lee, recently was inducted into the
Hall of Fame and was the original architect of the great Orioles
dynasty as well as American League president. Grandson Andy won two
World Series as the Twins' general manager.
</P>
<P>
   6. Perry _ There have been many great pitching brothers in
baseball _ the Deans, Niekros, Coveleskis _ but Gaylord and Jim are
the only two who both won Cy Young awards.
</P>
<P>
   7. Griffey _ Ken Griffey Sr. was an All-Star for the Reds. Ken
Griffey Jr. might be the best player of his generation.
</P>
<P>
   8. Bonds _ Bobby and Barry Bonds are the only father-son
combination in history to both be compared to Willie Mays.
</P>
<P>
   9. Alomar _ Sandy Alomar was an All-Star second baseman for the
California Angels, then was followed by two outstanding sons,
catcher Sandy Jr. and Roberto, one of the best second basemen in
baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   10. Stottlemyre _ Father Mel and son Todd have combined for 284
victories (through Wednesday), the most by any father-son
combination. Mel was one of the best pitchers in Yankees history,
but had the misfortune of playing for them in the bleak years of
1964-74 when the franchise was unusually ordinary.

TIMING OF CRUISE MISSILE ATTACK COMES UNDER FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: Adding two paragraphs at the end from RNC chairman and Steve
Forbes) (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG and MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most lawmakers, even ardent foes of President
Clinton, rallied behind his decision Thursday to attack suspected
terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan. But at least two asked
whether it was a calculated effort to change the subject from an
improper sexual relationship to national security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the president's personal difficulties this week, it is
legitimate to question the timing of this action,'' said Sen. Dan
Coats, R-Ind., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and
a longtime Clinton critic.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise missile strikes, retaliation for the Aug. 7 terrorist
bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, occurred less
than three days after Clinton reversed seven months of denials and
admitted to a relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky that he said ``was not appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The admission was a turning point in Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr's investigation of whether Clinton committed perjury and
obstructed justice in an effort to cover up the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Coats said of the military attack that took place as Lewinsky
was completing her second appearance before a federal grand jury
here: ``Once the president has broken the bond of trust with the
American people, as he has done with his repeated lies, it raises
questions about everything he does or does not do.''
</P>
<P>
   Coats said the attack could be an effort to divert attention
away from the Lewinsky matter by a chief executive ``desperately
trying to hold onto his job.'' He added, ``The timing of this was
extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said he supported the president but
stressed, ``I want to know more about the reasons and especially
the reasons for doing it now. ... Questions will be raised around
the world on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen rejected the notion that the
timing of the attack was a diversionary tactic like the one
depicted in the Hollywood film ``Wag the Dog.'' In the movie, a
fictional president embroiled in a sex scandal allows his aides to
manufacture a military crisis to divert public attention and win
reelection.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, asked about a possible analogy to the movie, said at a
news conference that ``the only motivation driving this action
today was our absolute obligation to protect the American people
from terrorist activities. That is the sole motivation. No other
consideration has been involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Most GOP lawmakers supported Clinton's decision and didn't
question the timing.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said the action was ``the
right thing to do at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said, ``The United
States has an absolute duty to attack terrorism where it lives and
breeds, in order to prevent future attacks on American citizens
around the world. The American people stand united in the face of
terrorism. The men and women who undertook this mission deserve our
praise and prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., one of the Senate's most respected
voices on defense issues, called the strikes a ``welcome response''
to the Aug. 7 embassy bombings that killed 257 people, including 12
Americans, and injured more than 5,000. ``The president did the
right thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, often a harsh Clinton critic, praised the
military action as ``clearly designed to strike at the heart of a
terrorist network that has the blood of American citizens on its
hands and which was planning further attacks on U.S. nationals.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said, ``Thank you, Mr. President. ...
Let's wage a war against terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., called the retaliation ``bold and
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   But a strong Clinton critic outside Congress, conservative
politician and Reagan administration official Oliver L. North,
said, ``Given what we know about this commander-in-chief, one has
to wonder if the theme song for this operation comes from the score
of `Braveheart' or `Wag the Dog.'''
</P>
<P>
   However, Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan
Brookings Institution who has often criticized Clinton, said, ``I
don't feel particularly cynical about this. We just have to give
the president the benefit of the doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Other longtime Clinton critics, Republican National Chairman Jim
Nicholson and GOP presidential candidate Steve Forbes, also
supported the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that America's enemies understand that the
American people are united in the fight against international
terrorism,'' Nicholson said.

COLLINS HAS ANGELS WINNING, NOT WHINING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Houston Astros went looking for a manager before the
1994 season, they asked one particular question to every candidate.
</P>
<P>
   What would you do if the club had to cut payroll and trade away
all our best players?
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates mumbled and stumbled around the question. Terry
Collins, so the story goes, looked his future employers in the eye
and said, ``I'd win.''
</P>
<P>
   Such bravado might seem trite, but Collins is doing exactly that
as manager of the Anaheim Angels. Their ownership seems
indifferent, the general manager has been almost ineffectual, their
best player (Tim Salmon) has a bad foot, their second-best player
(Darin Erstad) recently came off the disabled list and three-fifths
of the starting rotation has been on the DL.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Angels continue to hold off the Rangers and cling to
first place in the American League West. There is no sign of an
imminent collapse despite rumors of discontent when the Angels
failed to make a deal on the July 31 nonwaiver trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they heed their manager, who keeps saying, ``We can sit
here and pout or we can go out and get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels did receive some good news Wednesday when Jack
McDowell made his first start in three months and pitched seven
scoreless innings in a 2-0 victory against the Detroit Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels couldn't have been happier if Disney had announced
they were trading the merchandising rights to Grumpy, Dopey and
Sneezy to the Blue Jays for Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no telling how Jack will feel two days from now or
five days from now.'' Collins told reporters after Wednesday's
game. ``But you can't ask for anything more from a guy who hasn't
pitched in almost three months than what he gave tonight. He did it
on guts and savvy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad news, though, continues to follow the Angels. Pitcher Ken
Hill, who had elbow surgery earlier this year, was supposed to come
off the disabled list and pitch Sunday. But he was forced out of
his last medical-rehabilitation start with more pain in the elbow,
and the Angels don't know when he'll be ready to return.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels need him and all the pitching they can muster up
because they are heading into the most crucial stretch of their
season, one even worse than the Rangers' recent road trip. The
Angels, starting Monday after an all-night flight from the West
Coast, are looking at a 10-game road trip through New York, Boston
and Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The jaunt starts with five against the Yankees, including two
makeups of games postponed in April when a beam fell through a
ceiling at Yankee Stadium. While the Angels are enjoying the
sights, sounds and smells of New York City, the Rangers will be
starting a nine-game stretch against the Tigers and White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Logic says the Angels will get the stuffing kicked out of them
in the East, while the Rangers will swat aside those Central
Division losers and soar gracefully off to a division title. Then
they can focus on their real mission, which is to finish with a
better record than the AL Central-leading Cleveland Indians and
avoid the Yankees in the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are better than the Angels. They should be better
than the Indians, whose best hitters are either slumping or
injured, and whose best pitchers are suffering from tired arms.
</P>
<P>
   But, as 26 years have proved conclusively, nothing ever comes
easy for the Rangers. A six-game winning streak after the
acquisition of Todd Zeile, Todd Stottlemyre and Royce Clayton
seemed to indicate they were on their way, then they turned around
and lost eight of 10. They have a losing record since the All-Star
break.
</P>
<P>
   Collins is not going to let the Angels die. The Rangers will
have to fight this one to the finish and could easily blow it if
they're not careful.
</P>

   NICOSIA _ Carrying out President Bill Clinton's promise of dire
punishment of the bombers of U.S. embassies in Africa once again
raises the old ghost of the CIA's war against the Soviets in
Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989. It also involves major trouble for
old allies in that war.
</P>
<P>
   The chief suspect thus far in the assaults on the two embassies
is the Saudi construction tycoon Osama bin Laden, 45, who was
described in the early 1990s as a mastermind of international
terrorism by the U.S. State Department and other Western agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The rhetoric used in claims and near-claims of the bombings,
signed by an ``Islamic Army for the Liberation of the Muslim Holy
places'' or ``The Exiles,'' is virtually identical to bin Laden's
fiery declarations of war against America.
</P>
<P>
   The claims have to come either from him, from his disciples (the
few reporters who have visited him in his Sudanese and later Afghan
lairs estimate their number at about 3,000) or from someone wanting
to put the blame on him.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi multimillionaire, despite disavowals of him by his
family, probably has additional billions at his disposal from the
bin Laden construction firms, a Saudi business and engineering
empire with global reach. This gives him unlimited financial
resources.
</P>
<P>
   He put these at the disposal of the CIA and Pakistan during
their 10-year war to evict the Russians in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   With such resources, bin Laden and his acolytes can continue to
recruit and finance terrorists everywhere, including the likes of
the 1993 World Trade Center bombers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden has been the well-protected guest of the Taleban, the
Muslim zealots now overwhelming Afghanistan. The Taleban have
condemned the embassy bombings. They say they have warned bin Laden
not to proclaim holy war from Afghan territory.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since their appearance as fiercely austere ``students''
opposing the corruption and banditry of local Afghan warlords and
their conquest of Kabul in the mid-1990s, the Taleban have had
supply, training and political support from Pakistan's intelligence
service.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, Russia and governments of nearby ex-Soviet Muslim
republics such as Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan fear
that, feeling flush with current victories, the Taleban's Islamist
warriors _ who deny women schooling and skilled jobs, and enforce
medieval punishments for everything from adultery to inadequately
long men's beards _ may send ideology as well as soldiers abroad in
a jihad across the South and Central Asian borders.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, the CIA's companion-in-arms in the Afghan conflict,
which was the largest covert American operation since the wars in
Vietnam and Laos, is accused, possibly justly, of now lending
support by regular Pakistani military forces to the Taleban.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan vehemently denies this. However, it has long been clear
that Pakistan wants the Taleban to prevail over its Afghan foes.
Islamabad wants to control trade and energy routes between the
Indian Ocean and Central Asia. Despite Iranian, Russian and Indian
support, those Afghan foes are now on the run.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia, the main ally of the United States in the Muslim
world, has been financing the Taleban since their appearance, just
as it financed their immediate predecessors and godfathers, the
Afghan mujahidin who fought Russians and are now fighting their own
governments and societies, from Egypt and Algeria to the
Philippines and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Washington policymakers must consider the price that
is still being paid for their anti-Communist alliance with Muslim
extremists during the previous generation, especially in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   If the Taleban do not abandon bin Laden, could the United States
send air cover and strong special forces to break Taleban
resistance and arrest him or his followers, against opposition from
their Pakistani and Saudi allies?
</P>
<P>
   Could the Clinton administration sell to the U.S. Congress and
American public a reversal of alliances?
</P>
<P>
   It would mean opposing, at least temporarily, Pakistan and Saudi
Arabia, and joining instead the anti-Taleban coalition of Iran,
India, Russia and Russia's former Islamic subject states of Central
Asia, and perhaps igniting new conflicts. &QL;

<P>
   If a terrorist were to strike a U.S. city with a chemical or
biological agent, the Federal Bureau of Investigation would be
responsible for coordinating the response to the attack.
</P>
<P>
   A host of federal, state and local agencies would be mobilized
for the remediation effort, including the U.S. Army's Technical
Escort Unit (TEU). Part of the Army's Chemical and Biological
Defense Command (CBDCOM), the Aberdeen Proving Ground,
Maryland-based TEU has expertise and equipment found nowhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we're organized and equipped to deal with either a
chemical or biological device,'' said Lt. Col. Doug Norton, TEU
commander.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the capability to mitigate the effects of a device if
it has already functioned, or to render it safe if it hasn't
functioned. ... We also have the capability to search for a device,
take samples to determine if chemical or biological agents have
been released and, if we locate a device, we have the capability to
remove and transport it to the appropriate lab for
identification.''
</P>
<P>
   At any time, Norton said, a basic chemical and
biological-response team is ready to respond within four hours to
any incident anywhere in the United States. In all, the TEU has 83
military members and 99 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Domestic Preparedness Program, under which
``emergency responders'' from 120 U.S. cities are receiving
training in how to respond to an attack involving chemical,
biological or nuclear elements, is the most visible aspect of the
government's efforts to prepare for an urban nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   The training program is an interagency effort heavily supported
by the Defense Department through the Army Chemical and Biological
Defense Command. Essentially a ``train the trainer'' program, the
effort is aimed at policemen, firemen, hazardous materials
handlers, medical personnel and others who would be called upon to
respond to a so-called ``domestic WMD attack.'' It introduces them
to what they need to know and do _ beyond the actions they would
normally take _ to protect themselves while saving others' lives.
</P>
<P>
   The training program, as well as the rapid-response team,
springs from requirements in the 1997 Defense Authorization Act to
develop capabilities to aid in the event of a chemical or
biological incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the Army's Technical Escort Unit brings a great
deal to the table. Its members have years of expertise in crisis
management,'' said Jim Warrington, program director for domestic
preparedness at the CBDCOM. ``There's also the Marine Corps'
Chemical Biological Incident Response Force.''
</P>
<P>
   This year $43 million is being spent on the Pentagon's Domestic
Preparedness Program; next year $49 million is set aside for the
effort. ``We anticipate completing the training for all 120 cities
by fiscal year 2001,'' Warrington said.
</P>
<P>
   After an initial course of instruction in Denver in May 1997,
the original training concept was refined, and by mid-April, 23
sessions had been conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we've gone into a city, we've fine-tuned the
training,'' Warrington said. ``Usually the training lasts for one
week.'' The instructors include active-duty military and
non-military emergency personnel and Army Reserve teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at precautions in Israel, where recent scares from Iraq
placed the public in a fearful dilemma, a wide range of
countermeasures are either available or under development to
confront even the most horrifying chemical or biological threat.
</P>
<P>
   These include a highly capable passive defense organization
reaching to all levels, with shelters, personal equipment in the
hands of all the population and a highly professional medical
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Further, an experienced pharmaceutical industry can quickly
produce sufficient antidotes on short notice and distribute these
to the population within days. This was done during the most recent
crisis, together with an all-out effort by global purchasing agents
who obtained additional items abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The danger from a terrorist suicide attack is also well known in
Israel. Not much can be done to prevent these attacks other than
constant vigilance and the political resolve to move quickly
against known threats.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of such future attacks using chemical or
biological agents cannot be neglected, and effective measures to
give early warning or to initiate countermeasures must be
considered.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's early-warning defense system is geared to detect
suicide flyers, remote-controlled drones and converted
crop-spraying aircraft trying to sneak through, but these threats
are considered less likely.
</P>
<P>
   While Israel is a highly organized nation constantly on alert
for mass terror attacks, it has large squatter regions surrounding
already densely populated cities, increasing any risk.
</P>
<P>
   One can only hope that reason will continue to prevail _ not
only in the region known as the cradle of civilization _ but
everywhere.

   Meanwhile, the U.S. Domestic Preparedness Program, under which
``emergency responders'' from 120 U.S. cities are receiving
training in how to respond to an attack involving chemical,
biological or nuclear elements, is the most visible aspect of the
government's efforts to prepare for an urban nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   The training program is an interagency effort heavily supported
by the Defense Department through the Army Chemical and Biological
Defense Command. Essentially a ``train the trainer'' program, the
effort is aimed at policemen, firemen, hazardous materials
handlers, medical personnel and others who would be called upon to
respond to a so-called ``domestic WMD attack.'' It introduces them
to what they need to know and do _ beyond the actions they would
normally take _ to protect themselves while saving others' lives.
</P>
<P>
   The training program, as well as the rapid-response team,
springs from requirements in the 1997 Defense Authorization Act to
develop capabilities to aid in the event of a chemical or
biological incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the Army's Technical Escort Unit brings a great
deal to the table. Its members have years of expertise in crisis
management,'' said Jim Warrington, program director for domestic
preparedness at the CBDCOM. ``There's also the Marine Corps'
Chemical Biological Incident Response Force.''
</P>
<P>
   This year $43 million is being spent on the Pentagon's Domestic
Preparedness Program; next year $49 million is set aside for the
effort. ``We anticipate completing the training for all 120 cities
by fiscal year 2001,'' Warrington said.
</P>
<P>
   After an initial course of instruction in Denver in May 1997,
the original training concept was refined, and by mid-April, 23
sessions had been conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we've gone into a city, we've fine-tuned the
training,'' Warrington said. ``Usually the training lasts for one
week.'' The instructors include active-duty military and
non-military emergency personnel and Army Reserve teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at precautions in Israel, where recent scares from Iraq
placed the public in a fearful dilemma, a wide range of
countermeasures are either available or under development to
confront even the most horrifying chemical or biological threat.
</P>
<P>
   These include a highly capable passive defense organization
reaching to all levels, with shelters, personal equipment in the
hands of all the population and a highly professional medical
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Further, an experienced pharmaceutical industry can quickly
produce sufficient antidotes on short notice and distribute these
to the population within days. This was done during the most recent
crisis, together with an all-out effort by global purchasing agents
who obtained additional items abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The danger from a terrorist suicide attack is also well known in
Israel. Not much can be done to prevent these attacks other than
constant vigilance and the political resolve to move quickly
against known threats.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of such future attacks using chemical or
biological agents cannot be neglected, and effective measures to
give early warning or to initiate countermeasures must be
considered.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's early-warning defense system is geared to detect
suicide flyers, remote-controlled drones and converted
crop-spraying aircraft trying to sneak through, but these threats
are considered less likely.
</P>
<P>
   While Israel is a highly organized nation constantly on alert
for mass terror attacks, it has large squatter regions surrounding
already densely populated cities, increasing any risk.
</P>
<P>
   One can only hope that reason will continue to prevail _ not
only in the region known as the cradle of civilization _ but
everywhere.

   NICOSIA _ Carrying out President Bill Clinton's promise of dire
punishment of the bombers of U.S. embassies in Africa once again
raises the old ghost of the CIA's war against the Soviets in
Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989. It also involves major trouble for
old allies in that war.
</P>
<P>
   The chief suspect thus far in the assaults on the two embassies
is the Saudi construction tycoon Osama bin Laden, 45, who was
described in the early 1990s as a mastermind of international
terrorism by the U.S. State Department and other Western agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The rhetoric used in claims and near-claims of the bombings,
signed by an ``Islamic Army for the Liberation of the Muslim Holy
places'' or ``The Exiles,'' is virtually identical to bin Laden's
fiery declarations of war against America.
</P>
<P>
   The claims have to come either from him, from his disciples (the
few reporters who have visited him in his Sudanese and later Afghan
lairs estimate their number at about 3,000) or from someone wanting
to put the blame on him.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi multimillionaire, despite disavowals of him by his
family, probably has additional billions at his disposal from the
bin Laden construction firms, a Saudi business and engineering
empire with global reach. This gives him unlimited financial
resources.
</P>
<P>
   He put these at the disposal of the CIA and Pakistan during
their 10-year war to evict the Russians in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   With such resources, bin Laden and his acolytes can continue to
recruit and finance terrorists everywhere, including the likes of
the 1993 World Trade Center bombers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden has been the well-protected guest of the Taleban, the
Muslim zealots now overwhelming Afghanistan. The Taleban have
condemned the embassy bombings. They say they have warned bin Laden
not to proclaim holy war from Afghan territory.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since their appearance as fiercely austere ``students''
opposing the corruption and banditry of local Afghan warlords and
their conquest of Kabul in the mid-1990s, the Taleban have had
supply, training and political support from Pakistan's intelligence
service.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, Russia and governments of nearby ex-Soviet Muslim
republics such as Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan fear
that, feeling flush with current victories, the Taleban's Islamist
warriors _ who deny women schooling and skilled jobs, and enforce
medieval punishments for everything from adultery to inadequately
long men's beards _ may send ideology as well as soldiers abroad in
a jihad across the South and Central Asian borders.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, the CIA's companion-in-arms in the Afghan conflict,
which was the largest covert American operation since the wars in
Vietnam and Laos, is accused, possibly justly, of now lending
support by regular Pakistani military forces to the Taleban.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan vehemently denies this. However, it has long been clear
that Pakistan wants the Taleban to prevail over its Afghan foes.
Islamabad wants to control trade and energy routes between the
Indian Ocean and Central Asia. Despite Iranian, Russian and Indian
support, those Afghan foes are now on the run.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia, the main ally of the United States in the Muslim
world, has been financing the Taleban since their appearance, just
as it financed their immediate predecessors and godfathers, the
Afghan mujahidin who fought Russians and are now fighting their own
governments and societies, from Egypt and Algeria to the
Philippines and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Washington policymakers must consider the price that
is still being paid for their anti-Communist alliance with Muslim
extremists during the previous generation, especially in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   If the Taleban do not abandon bin Laden, could the United States
send air cover and strong special forces to break Taleban
resistance and arrest him or his followers, against opposition from
their Pakistani and Saudi allies?
</P>
<P>
   Could the Clinton administration sell to the U.S. Congress and
American public a reversal of alliances?
</P>
<P>
   It would mean opposing, at least temporarily, Pakistan and Saudi
Arabia, and joining instead the anti-Taleban coalition of Iran,
India, Russia and Russia's former Islamic subject states of Central
Asia, and perhaps igniting new conflicts. &QL;

LEWINSKY SPENDS FIVE MORE HOURS TESTIFYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica S. Lewinsky Thursday answered questions for
five hours before a federal grand jury that is examining whether
her sexual relationship with President Clinton went farther than he
acknowledged. Prosecutors focused on whether Clinton committed
perjury when asked about the former White House intern in a January
deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, making her second appearance before the grand jury,
was expected to expand upon her earlier testimony, reportedly that
Clinton touched private parts of her body, which would contradict
the president's sworn denial of such action. Some Republicans have
said Clinton should resign or be impeached if it is proven he
committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, prosecutors Thursday obtained samples of Clinton's
DNA, which will be compared to a stain found on one of Lewinsky's
dresses. The possibility that investigators would find a match
apparently played a role in convincing Clinton to admit Monday that
he had an inappropriate relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton's DNA matches the dress stain, it could provide
further evidence that the president had a sexual relationship with
Lewinsky and contradict his earlier testimony that he couldn't
recall meeting with her privately.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, wearing a gray dress and looking somber, did not talk
to a large press gathering at the federal courthouse before or
after her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``She answered all questions truthfully and completely,''
Lewinsky spokeswoman Judy Smith said about Thursday's testimony.
``Ms. Lewinsky is really looking forward to beginning the process
of rebuilding her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his address to the nation on Monday, indicated that
he did not commit perjury in his January deposition because his
denial of sexual relations with Lewinsky was ``legally accurate.''
Clinton aides have said that means the president had some type of
sex with Lewinsky, reportedly oral sex, that did not fall within
the definition of sexual relations used in the deposition.
</P>
<P>
   While White House officials decry this intense focus on the
nature of the sex between Clinton and Lewinsky, legal analysts said
Clinton ensured the matter would come under scrutiny by saying
Monday night that his initial denial of sexual relations was
legally accurate.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the definition of sexual relations as defined during
Clinton's deposition in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit:
``contact with genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or
buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the
sexual desire of any person.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Clinton's aides suggested that if Clinton
received oral sex from Lewinsky but never touched certain parts of
her body, that would be outside the definition of sexual relations
used in the deposition. But in her Aug. 6 testimony, Lewinsky
reportedly said Clitnon touched her breasts and other parts of her
body.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans, such as Representative Bill McCollum of
Florida, have said that if Clinton lied in the Jones deposition
about his sexual contact with Lewinsky, then he should be
impeached.
</P>
<P>
   But others, mostly Democrats, have said if Clinton lied about
his sexual contact with Lewinsky in the Jones deposition, it would
not amount to perjury because the judge ruled that testimony
regarding the former intern was not ``material'' to the Jones
lawsuit and dismissed the case.
</P>
<P>
   This has led to some awkward explanations of Clinton's possible
defense. Representative Martin Meehan, the Massachusetts Democrat
who sits on the House Judiciary Committee that hears impeachment
cases, said Clinton could have lied without committing perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lying and perjury aren't the same thing from a legal
perspective,'' Meehan said earlier this week. ``Perjury requires it
be a material fact to a judicial'' proceeding. ``That doesn't mean
he didn't lie. He admitted that he lied to the American people. But
you would have to look and see what the standard was in the
deposition. Legally, by definition, perjury requires that there be
a material lie to a material fact.''
</P>
<P>
   While there remains much argument over whether Clinton's
statement in the Jones deposition could be perjury, there is
widespread agreement that the president would be in danger of
impeachment if he lied before the grand jury on Monday. Thus,
Starr, in recalling Lewinsky before the grand jury, wanted to
examine Clinton's statements.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, in addition to focusing on whether Clinton lied about the
nature of his sexual relations with Lewinsky in the grand jury
testimony, wanted to explore Lewinsky's knowledge of whether the
president tried to cover up their relationship. The grand jury, for
example, has examined whether Clinton urged Lewinsky to return
gifts to presidential secretary Betty Currie in order to conceal
their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton testified Monday that he did not order Currie to obtain
the gifts from Lewinsky, The New York Times reported Thursday. The
gifts, which included a dress, gold brooch and hatpin, had been
subpoenaed as exhibits in the Jones case. Lewinsky testified that
Clinton told her that if she no longer had the gifts she couldn't
turn them over, The Times said. The day after that conversation,
Currie telephoned Lewinsky and said she understood Lewinsky had
some gifts to return, the newspaper said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Osama bin Muhammad bin Awad Bin Laden is the
self-appointed president of a University of Holy War in
Afghanistan, U.S. officials say.
</P>
<P>
   From his Afghan redoubt, he has declared war against U.S.
interests everywhere, fueled by rage against U.S. power in the
Middle East, and backed, the officials say, by an international
network of terrorists and companies.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago he moved his base from Sudan, where he lived from
1991 to 1996, forming a close alliance with that nation's most
powerful man: Hassan Turabi. The leader of Sudan's ruling party,
the National Islamic Front, Turabi saw himself as the Grand Vizier
of Islam, the leading voice for Islamic fundamentalism in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden has saved his strongest anger for U.S. forces and U.S.
allies in his homeland, Saudi Arabia. This year, he publicly warned
that American civilians were his targets as well. Thursday, the
United States made war on him and his Sudanese allies.
</P>
<P>
   Just a decade ago, the United States considered bin Laden
himself as an ally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew him as one of the Saudi benefactors who took care of
widows and orphans'' of the U.S.-backed Afghan rebels who fought
off Soviet invaders in the 1980s, said a retired U.S. official who
helped fight that long battle.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden spent millions supporting the Afghan guerrillas,
financing thousands of volunteer foreign soldiers who came to
Afghanistan from throughout the Islamic world, and creating a
network of guest houses and charities to support them and their
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a common cause with the United States,'' said Zalmay
Khalilzad, a former State Department and Pentagon official of
Afghan descent who monitored the war. ``But with the end of the
Soviet occupation in 1989, his struggle became the struggle against
the United States, the dominant power in the world and in the
Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden returned to his native Saudi Arabia in 1989, and began
to support militant Islamic groups opposing moderate Islamic
governments.
</P>
<P>
   His rage against the United States took root during the 1991
Gulf war, with the continuing presence of U.S. troops on the sands
of his native Saudi Arabia. ``He regarded that as an occupation of
the Islamic holy places by the United States,'' Khalilzad said, and
bin Laden swore vengeance against what he called ``the crusaders''
of Christianity trespassing on Mecca and Medina.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this man thinks about every day is: How do I get the U.S.
out of my home in Saudi Arabia, and how do I get those corrupt
pharaohs out of power?'' said Kenneth Katzman, a former CIA analyst
who is the Congressional Research service's resident expert on
Middle Eastern terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden's views are shared by Turabi, whose bond with bin
Laden helped place the Sudan on the United States' short list of
state sponsors of international terrorism, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bin Laden is inspired by Turabi's expansive vision; he sees
eye to eye with him,'' Katzman said. ``They are allies. They are
close associates. They are business partners. Bin Laden is Turabi's
alter ego, his field commander, his operations chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Several intelligence analysts noted Thursday that the U.S.
Embassy in Sudan was all but evacuated in 1996, following a
terrorist threat _ and relocated at the U.S. Embassy in Kenya,
which was bombed on August 7, along with the U.S. Embassy in
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses _ and fronts for terrorism _ established by bin Laden
in the Sudan in the early 1990s continue to flourish. The National
Islamic Front is a financial partner in bin Laden's import-export,
agricultural cooperative, construction and Islamic banking
businesses based in and around Khartoum, the capital of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bin Laden has made financial contributions to the Sudanese
military-industrial complex,'' a senior U.S. intelligence official
said Thursday, ``of which, we believe, the Shifa pharmaceutical
facility is part.'' That plant was attacked by the United States on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 and 1992, bin Laden gave jobs in the Sudan to hundreds
of his proteges, veterans of the Afghan war who had come from
across northern Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. These
veterans became the core of an international network. They started
looking for new worlds to conquer.
</P>
<P>
   They told each other: ``We have a British grave in Afghanistan.
We have a Soviet grave. And then we will have an American grave,''
said a politically moderate Afghan veteran commander, Abdul Haq.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, a skilled construction engineer, began working to
build that grave.
</P>
<P>
   He went to work trying to form ``a multinational organization
for jihad, to purge the world of Western corrupters and their Arab
friends,'' a U.S. intelligence official said. Jihad is the Arabic
word for holy war.
</P>
<P>
   His goal, said the official, was ``a stateless, global jihad
without borders,'' and with his millions, he aimed to build ``a
huge alliance of like-minded groups.''
</P>
<P>
   He became the world's leading individual sponsor of terrorism
against Americans, spending a large part of the $250 million
fortune he inherited from his father, who built palaces, mosques
and public works for the Saudi royal family. That money went to
help create a global network of armed fundamentalists, backed by
businesses and banks that functioned as front organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a very intricate financial infrastructure,'' said a
senior U.S. intelligence official. ``He has networks on every
continent almost. He has an infrastructure that's very, very
replete with capability, people, money.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, United States intelligence agencies have tried
to track bin Laden and have compiled a chronology of his career,
including these highlights:
</P>
<P>
   In December 1992, his operatives tried to bomb a hotel in Aden,
Yemen, where 100 U.S. soldiers were billeted en route to support
United Nations peacekeeping operations in Somalia. The job was
botched; two Australian tourists were killed.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1993 came the World Trade Center bombing in New
York. No concrete evidence ties bin Laden's followers to that
attack, but Pakistani intelligence officials say Ramzi Ahmed
Yousef, the convicted mastermind of the bombing, spent most of the
following three years until his arrest at a guest house called the
House of Martyrs in Peshawar, Pakistan, which was owned by bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1993, bin Laden channeled tens of millions of
dollars a year through Islamic banks and charities to terrorist
organizations, militant groups and extremist political movements
based in Egypt, Algeria, Yemen, Sudan, Lebanon, and the
Philippines, as well as providing support for the shadowy and
stateless group known as Islamic Jihad, U.S. officials say. He has
also claimed to support Islamic movements in Bosnia, Kashmir,
Tajikistan, Chechnya and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   By January 1994, bin Laden had established at least three
terrorist camps in the Sudan, where rebels from a half-dozen
different nations received training and shelter, according to U.S.
intelligence analysts. And by 1995, bin Laden's businesses and
training camps in the Sudan had provided safe haven to radical
followers who had then fanned out over the Islamic world, from
North Africa, across the Middle East, to South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1996, under intense pressure from the United States,
Sudan expelled bin Laden, hoping to receive U.S. economic
assistance. It never came. He returned to Afghanistan, where he
received political protection and support from the Taliban, the
armed religious extremist group that now controls much of
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   He has been living in Afghanistan, first outside Jalalabad, then
outside Khandahar, ever since. He established at least two sets of
terrorist training camps in that war-shattered land: the biggest,
near the provincial capital of Khost, was bombed by the United
States on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad were located in the Khost
camp, including their leader, Ayman el-Zawahri, who is wanted for
terrorism in Egypt. So were members of the Islamic Group, which
assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrorists of various nationalities have trained there,'' a
senior intelligence official said Thursday. ``This is the largest
Sunni terrorist training facility in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden is thought to have, at minimum, a supporting role in
the bombing of two U.S. military installations in Saudi Arabia that
killed a total of 24 Americans in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He hardly disavowed it; in a February 1997 interview, he said:
``We had thought that the Riyadh and al-Khobar blasts were a
sufficient signal to sensible U.S. decision-makers to avert a real
battle between the Islamic nation and U.S. forces, but it seems
they did not understand the signal.''
</P>
<P>
   On August 6, the day before the bombings of the U.S. embassies
in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, the Egyptian Jihad group sent the
United States a warning: They would soon deliver a message to
Americans ``which we hope they read with care, because we will
write it, with God's help, in a language they will understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the United States replied in kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a war,'' Khalilzad said. ``They did two bombings, we
did two, in two different countries, two different targets. If the
targets associated with bin Laden were destroyed, there will be
some effect on his ability to do things. Whatever plans he may have
had in place, whether those will be affected by the attacks, we
can't tell. Whether his organization will be deterred, who knows.
But this is a strong message to those people who thought they could
remain beyond the reach of civilized law in the anarchy of
Afghanistan.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the man in charge of the camps was reported by
his followers in Afghanistan to have survived, making it likely
that his violent dialogue with the United States would continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know where bin Laden is,'' a senior intelligence
official said, adding: ``The prospect of retaliation against
Americans is very, very high.''

backing the Afghan rebels. When that battle was over, he and his

<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ In a series of lightning raids with the
Albanian secret police this summer, American intelligence agents
appear to have thwarted a bomb plot against the American Embassy
here. They also seem to have broken up a ring of Egyptian Islamic
terrorists using this nation's anarchy to set up a base.
</P>
<P>
   The raids netted five suspects wanted in Egypt, some of whom
were facing death sentences. At least two of them have been
extradited to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The raids, which began in June and ended last week, after the
terror bombings in Africa, seized material that included plans for
bombing the embassy here, according to Albanian security officials.
</P>
<P>
   Acting after the bombing of their embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, American officials responded to the threat by destroying
embassy communications equipment last week, one of the steps
mandated when an embassy might be attacked by terrorists, an
American security agent said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether the planned attack here was part of, or
even provoked, by the African terrorism, but like the embassies in
Africa, Albania offered a soft target, since the country has a
fragile infrastructure in which the Americans were seen as friendly
to the government.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the United States sent in some 200 Marines, 10 Navy
Seals and a number of other plainclothes security men to evacuate
dependents and nonessential personnel and guard the handful
remaining in the gated American residential compound, a tiny slice
of suburbia amid the brutal peasant poverty here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told there is a high threat out there,'' said Maj.
Frank Carroll, the commander of the marines from the 22d Marine
Expeditionary Unit who were diverted from a planned NATO training
exercise last Friday night to protect the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged terrorists operated under cover of an infusion of
Islamic proselytizers from Egypt, Saudi Arabia and other Arab
countries, many of them fundamentalists. They have flocked here to
build hospitals, schools and orphanages, under condition that they
can also build mosques.
</P>
<P>
   Albania is nominally two-thirds Muslim as a heritage of the
Ottoman Empire, but there are also substantial Roman Catholic and
Greek Orthodox populations. But the nation historically has not
always taken religion seriously. A local proverb translates
roughly, ``Religion follows the sword,'' or political power.
</P>
<P>
   And Albania virtually fell apart in March 1997 when the collapse
of a pyramid scheme bankrupted much of the population, leading to
rioting, the dissolution of the army, looting of weapons and the
collapse of the government.
</P>
<P>
   In that milieu, officials here say, Islamic Jihad and other
groups took the opportunity to set up operations in a place with
porous borders and few, if any, internal controls.
</P>
<P>
   The news of the raids here and of their American direction was
discovered broken by the scuffling police reporters of the
country's two biggest newspapers. The Albanian authorities,
embarrassed and worried about retaliation, have clammed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``My instinct told me the story was really a big story,'' said
Alfred Peza, editor of Gazeta Shqiptare, savoring the moment at
Fideli's, a crowded cafe. ``The police regretted it the next day.
Maybe in the excitement of telling the story of the good work they
had done, they went too far. The next day, the police bosses
cracked down.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, neighbors at one of the sites of the raids, an
alley off Myslym Shyri Street, near police headquarters, confirmed
the details of American supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Several English-speaking foreigners carrying walkie-talkies
stood in the alley directing the operation while the Albanian
secret police searched the upstairs apartment, said the neighbors,
none of whom, after decades of the Communist rule, would give their
names.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the Albanian secret police, known as Shik,
declined a request for an interview Thursday, indicating that the
Americans, with whom he was still working closely, had forcefully
expressed the position that too much had been said already.
</P>
<P>
   But in an earlier interview with an Albanian newspaper, the
secret police chief, Fatos Khosi, described the issue of Islamic
fundamentalism as ``a very delicate theme.''
</P>
<P>
   But he told the daily Koha Jone that Albania was vulnerable to
infiltration, saying: ``It is a poor country, ready to accept aid.
Its borders are relatively easy to cross, and this has made it a
relatively comfortable country for people that are wanted in their
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The previous government of President Sari Berisha, a casualty of
the pyramid scheme collapse, had what was known as a ``cracked
door'' policy in which even people with dubious or forged
credentials could enter Albania in hopes of bringing currency into
the poorest country of Europe. Albania was totally isolated for
nearly half a century under the late dictator Enver Hoxha, a
Stalinist decades after Stalin, whose legacy is crumbling circular
concrete barriers _ against anybody _ scattered every few hundred
yards all over the landscape.

ONLINE BOOKSELLER TO MAKE PUBLIC OFFERING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ With competition intensifying among electronic
booksellers, Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc. announced Thursday that it would
sell shares to the public of its money-losing online venture, which
trails in sales behind the pioneering leader, Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble, the nation's largest bookstore chain, intends to
sell 20 percent of the online venture, Barnesandnoble.com, which
generated $14 million in sales last year in contrast to Amazon's
$147.8 million. The initial public offering could take place in the
next 30 days, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're using the IPO to televise that they have online
capability, and secondly to enrich the value of Barnes &AMP; Noble
stock, which is going to retain 80 percent'' of the online venture,
said Linda Killian, portfolio manager for Renaissance Capital Corp.
in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Barnes &AMP; Noble rose 7.5 percent Thursday, or $2.8125,
to $40.0625, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. While the
overall stock market has recently slumped, some new issues of
Web-based businesses, like Geocities, have risen sharply.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Barnes &AMP; Noble announced its plans for a public
offering, the company said that its loss for the second quarter
tripled, primarily because of a $23 million loss from the online
venture. Barnes &AMP; Noble reported a loss of $5.7 million, or 8 cents
a share fully diluted, compared with a loss of $1.37 million, or 2
cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 9.3
percent, to $675 million. The results were in line with Wall Street
analysts' forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Security and Exchange Commission restrictions, Mary Ellen
Keating, a spokeswoman for Barnes &AMP; Noble in New York, declined to
answer questions about why the company intends to make the offering
or how the proceeds would be used.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, when a company spins off a division it could mean
that the unit's executives will get more independence and stock
option incentives that give them more of a stake in the company,
Ms. Killian of Renaissance Capital said. ``It would make them more
competitive with Amazon.com,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, Barnes &AMP; Noble hired several top executives
for the online venture, including a new chief financial officer,
and two vice presidents in marketing and international strategies.
One of the new executives, John Rindlaub Jr., comes with marketing
experience from Shoplink Inc., a PC-based grocery shopping and home
delivery company. The chief executive of the online venture will
remain Stephen Riggio, the vice chairman of Barnes &AMP; Noble, whose
roots are in traditional bookselling.
</P>
<P>
   The number of users of the company's Web site
(www.barnesandnoble.com) has continued to grow, with 720,000
customers by early August, compared with 500,000 last May. These
gains come as the company redesigned its Web site to offer
one-click ordering. The online division is also preparing to
introduce a new advertising campaign in the fall with a projected
1998 advertising budget of $35 million to $40 million. The New York
office of TBWA Chiat/Day was named last month to handle the
account.
</P>
<P>
   But the competition among online bookstores could intensify with
the entry of the German media conglomerate, Bertelsmann AG, which
is expected to open its online store, Booksonline, in Europe and
the United States in the fall. The Borders Group Inc. started its
online bookstore earlier this year although the company, the
second-largest bookstore retailer, has been concentrating more on
overseas expansion with the opening of conventional bookstores in
London and Singapore.

EXPERTS SAY BOMBINGS WILL COMBAT TERRORISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RICK KARLIN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Thursday's bombings of targets in Sudan and
Afghanistan represents a new paradigm for how the United States
will combat terrorism, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes are a clear demonstration that the United States
can, without the slow coalition-building of the Gulf War, reach
deep inside foreign borders and up the ante in a war of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have with the terrorist groups is a major change in
the nature of war,'' said Tom Kelly, a Siena College history
professor who follows military issues. By launching missiles from
sea with no risk to U.S. troops, the strikes sent a message to the
effect that ``we can kill a whole bunch of you without risking any
of our own people,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the post-Cold War era now,'' said Steven Hoffmann, a
Skidmore College political science professor. Terrorism, he said,
is ``the primary warfare that we in the U.S. have to worry about
right now.''Battling terrorists requires a shift in military and
political strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are trying to combat an amorphous opponent,'' said Abdo
Baaklini, director of the Center for Legislative Development at the
University at Albany's Rockefeller College.
</P>
<P>
   The Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya
represent a new style of terrorism-driven warfare, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``In (most of) the 20th Century, the nation-state had a monopoly
on organized violence. Now we are looking at organized violence by
ethnic groups, religious groups and terrorists groups,'' Kelly
said.
</P>
<P>
   Osama bin Laden, suspected of masterminding the embassy
bombings, embodies this kind of post-Cold War enemy.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy bombings represent what military tacticians call an
``asymmetric'' strategy in which the attacker doesn't try to match
the enemy in pound-for-pound firepower or troop strength, said
Hoffmann.
</P>
<P>
   This shift requires a change in the way the United States fights
back. The U.S. airstrike against one of bin Laden's suspected bases
sends a message that it won't be easy to hide and that the U.S.
will strike back wherever it can, despite the lack of clear battle
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says, `they cannot hide and we're not going to wait until a
court proves who is responsible,' '' noted Baaklini. ``When you are
trying to combat an amorphous opponent ... you widen the circle
sometimes, and you narrow it other times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What they've done is the only thing available,'' Kelly said of
Thursday's attack. ``They have said to him, `yes, we can touch you
and, yes, we can defend ourselves.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly added that military and intelligence planners have long
known that the factory in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum was
suspected of harboring chemical weapon components.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they satellite-viewed this for a long time,'' Kelly
said.

U.S. WARNS AMERICANS ABROAD TO BE MORE CAUTIOUS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States on Thursday issued a new
worldwide warning to Americans and diplomatic personnel ``to
exercise much greater caution than usual'' following U.S. military
strikes against suspected terrorist targets in Afghanistan and
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. embassies, already on alert, were told of the raids and
warned to take precautions simultaneously with the cruise-missile
strikes themselves, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As military planning accelerated over the last week, U.S.
officials, concerned about reprisals, were already removing
non-essential personnel and family members from vulnerable U.S.
embassies in Albania, Pakistan, Eritrea and other possible targets
for retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the measures were ordered, Aug. 11, four days after
the East Africa bombings, U.S. officials said they were responding
to threats and to protect less-secure U.S. embassies that had not
been brought up to current standards because of budgetary
constraints. But that was also the day of a meeting of top Cabinet
officials in the White House to discuss the evidence against the
alleged terrorist ringleader Osama bin Laden and military plans to
attack him.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said Thursday that the embassy staff reductions,
and the suspension of some embassy operations, were part of the
military planning process, to limit U.S. vulnerability should Mr.
bin Laden and his allies try themselves to retaliate. Other
embassies affected included Malaysia, Uganda, Egypt and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the time said they could not recall a similar
instance when several U.S. diplomatic installations, which often
get diffuse threats, suspended operations simultaneously. And U.S.
non-diplomatic personnel working with charities and other
non-governmental organizations in Afghanistan were also advised to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   As the week went on, intelligence showed planning for new
attacks. ``We had very specific information about very specific
threats with respect to very specific targets,'' said National
Security Adviser Samuel Berger on Thursday. ``You will have noted
over the past week that we have closed certain embassies, we have
drawn other embassies down, we have taken other measures to protect
American citizens abroad, so that in addition to the general
expressed intention of this organization to perpetrate terrorist
incidents against the United States, there was very specific
information and very reliable information.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing everything we can to protect Americans
everywhere,'' said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said,
without providing details. But she emphasized that Thursday's air
strikes are only ``a part of a long-term battle against terrorism
and the terrorists who have, in fact, declared war on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Albright said: ``What I think is very important for the
American people to understand is that there may in fact be
retaliatory actions. We are very concerned about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials said Thursday that in addition to obvious
messages and cautions, U.S. intelligence, law enforcement and
military officials have also been working with other countries to
disrupt plans for attacks on U.S. embassies _ Albania in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials were reluctant to identify other countries,
saying they did not want to give terrorists either ``a game plan''
or ``an indication of what we know,'' one senior official said.
</P>
<P>
   New drawdowns are expected from U.S. embassies in Central Asia
and the Caucasus, like Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan,
Azerbaijan, Georgia and Tajikistan, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's worldwide caution intensified earlier warnings of
Aug. 16 and Aug. 7. Thursday's announcement urged Americans to take
``additional and enhanced precautions'' in Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran,
Libya and North Korea, where there are no American diplomatic
posts.
</P>
<P>
   It reminded Americans that embassy operations have already been
suspended in Somalia, Sudan, Guinea-Bissau and the Congo, currently
ripped by a rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of the recent U.S. military strikes against terrorist
targets in Afghanistan and Sudan, and possible threats to Americans
and U.S. interests overseas, the State Department urges U.S.
citizens traveling or residing abroad to review their security
practices, to remain alert to the changing situation and to
exercise much greater caution than usual,'' the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are in a very sober mood here and throughout the
government,'' one administration official said. ``You heard
Albright saying it isn't over and retaliation is possible, and the
American people have to understand that. This is not the end of the
story and people are keenly aware of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Unocal, a U.S. oil company with worldwide interests, itself took
defensive steps Thursday, announcing that it would suspend all
activities involving a proposed natural-gas pipeline that would
link Turkmenistan to Pakistan through Afghanistan. The action was
taken ``in light of U.S. government actions Thursday,'' said a
Unocal representative.

ARNOLD LOSES CENTURY 21 ACCOUNT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Arnold Communications, Boston's biggest advertising
agency, lost one of its biggest clients Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Century 21 Real Estate Corp., a New Jersey-based company that
spends about $40 million a year on advertising, said Thursday it
had parted ways with Arnold and hired Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS of New
York as its new agency of record,
</P>
<P>
   Arnold, which had estimated billings of about $750 million in
1997 and whose big clients include Volkswagen of America, regional
franchise cooperatives of McDonald's Corp., and Ocean Spray
Cranberries Inc., was hired as Century 21's ad agency last
September.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Arnold could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going forward, we need to uniquely position the Century 21
System in the minds of consumers such that the brand is
differentiated, thus gaining a real competitive advantage,'' said
Steve Savino, Century 21's senior vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   In an informal ad agency review, Lowe &AMP; Partners ``was chosen as
a result of their strength and track record in managing brands for
change,'' Savino said.
</P>
<P>
   Savino said he assumed his job at Century 21 six weeks ago. At a
previous job with Heublein Inc., the wine-and-spirits company,
Savino said he enjoyed a three-year relationship with Lowe &AMP;
Partners between 1993 and 1996; during that time, he said he had
become an admirer of the agency's work.
</P>
<P>
   Of his new job at Century 21, Savino said: ``When I took this
job six weeks ago, I took a clean sheet of paper to look ahead and
see where we should be going.''
</P>
<P>
   Savino said he concluded that Century 21 ``needed a different
approach to how we advertise our brand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were happy with Arnold's `More power to you' campaign,'' he
said. ``But after we seeded that message, we felt we needed more of
an image-building campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   With $740 million in billings, Lowe &AMP; Partners is part of the
Lowe Group, which is owned by the Interpublic Group of Cos., a New
York holding company that recently acquired Hill Holliday Connors
Cosmopulos of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Clients of Lowe &AMP; Partners include Mercedes-Benz, Coca-Cola Co.,
and Gillette Co. brands Braun and Oral-B.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Arnold was acquired by Snyder Communications Inc. of
Bethesda, Md.

   Music, art and drama can pay huge intellectual dividends in

   More and more businesses are adopting policies that recognize
the problems parents have balancing work and family. But now these
family-friendly policies are igniting a backlash from childless
employees who feel resentful about what they perceive as more
favorable treatment of working parents. Harris looks at the
validity of these objections and suggests ways that employers can
treat both groups equitably. (slugged:

   High-fat diets and sedentary lifestyles are leading an
increasing number of children to tip the scales at far beyond their
ideal weight. Hours of playing videogames or watching television
instead of partaking in more physical activities are taking their

Downey offers advice to parents on how to help children take off
those extra pounds. (slugged:

<P>
   What do normal people feel is the main relief provided by the
end of the Cold War? It is that the danger of nuclear war is off
their backs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet today, ``weapons of mass destruction'' present more and
different things to worry about than during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   For one, nuclear arms are no longer a paramount concern, but
chemical and biological weapons have come to the fore. For another,
there is less danger of complete annihilation, but more danger of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Cold War is over and American and Russian nuclear
inventories are much smaller, there is less chance of an
apocalyptic exchange of many thousands of weapons. But the
probability that some smaller number of lethal weapons will be used
is growing.
</P>
<P>
   The points to keep in mind about the new world of mass
destruction are the following.
</P>
<P>
   _ First, the roles such weapons play in international conflict
are changing. They no longer represent the technological frontier
of warfare. Increasingly, they will be weapons of the weak states,
poorer countries or groups that militarily are at best
second-class.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, the mainstays of Cold War security policy _ deterrence
and arms control _ are not what they used to be. Some new threats
may not be deterrable, and the role of arms control in dealing with
weapons of mass destruction has been marginalized. In a few
instances, continuing devotion to deterrence and arms control may
have side effects that offset the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   _ Third, some of the responses most likely to cope with the
threats in novel ways will not find a warm welcome. The response
that should now be the highest priority is one long ignored,
opposed, or ridiculed: a serious civil-defense program to blunt the
effects of WMD if they are unleashed within the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most effective measures to prevent attacks within
the United States may also challenge traditional civil liberties if
pursued to the maximum. And the most troubling conclusion for
foreign policy as a whole is that reducing the odds of attacks in
the United States might require pulling back from involvement in
some foreign conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   American activism to guarantee international stability is,
paradoxically, the prime source of American vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   This was partly true in the Cold War, when the main danger that
nuclear weapons might detonate on U.S. soil sprang from strategic
engagement in Europe, Asia and the Middle East to deter attacks on
U.S. allies. But engagement then assumed a direct link between
regional stability and U.S. survival.
</P>
<P>
   The connection is less evident today, when there is no globally
threatening superpower or transnational ideology to be contained _
only an array of serious but entirely local disruptions. Today, as
the only nation acting to police areas outside its own region, the
United States makes itself a target for states or groups whose
aspirations are frustrated by U.S. power.
</P>
<P>
   When nuclear weapons were born, they represented the most
advanced military applications of science, technology, and
engineering. None but the great powers could hope to obtain them.
By now, however, nuclear arms have been around for more than half a
century, and chemical and biological weapons even longer.
</P>
<P>
   They are not just getting old. In the strategic terms most
relevant to American security, they have become primitive.
</P>
<P>
   Once the military cutting edge of the strong, they have become
the only hope for so-called rogue states or terrorists who want to
contest American power.
</P>
<P>
   The Persian Gulf War of 1991 demonstrated the American advantage
in a manner that stunned many abroad. Although the U.S. defense
budget has plunged, other countries are not closing the gap. U.S.
military spending remains more than triple that of any potentially
hostile power and higher than the combined defense budgets of
Russia, China, Iran, Iraq, North Korea and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling along in what some see as a revolution in military
affairs, American forces continue to make unmatched use of
state-of-the-art weapons, surveillance and information systems, and
the organizational and doctrinal flexibility for managing the
integration of these complex innovations into ``systems of
systems'' that is the key to modern military effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   More than ever in military history, brains are brawn. Even if
hostile countries somehow catch up in an arms race, their military
organizations and cultures are unlikely to catch up in the
competence race for management, technology assimilation and combat
command skills.
</P>
<P>
   If it is infeasible for hostile states to counter the United
States in conventional combat, it is even more daunting for smaller
groups such as terrorists. If the United States is lucky, the
various violent groups with grievances against the American
government and society will continue to think up schemes using
conventional explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Few terrorist groups have shown an interest in inflicting true
mass destruction. Bombings or hostage seizures have generally
threatened no more than a few hundred lives. Let us hope that this
limitation has been for a powerful underlying reason, rather than a
simple lack of capability, and that the few exceptions do not
become more typical.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sure reason to bet on such restraint. If terrorists
decide that they want to stun American policymakers by inflicting
enormous damage, low-tech weapons of mass destruction become more
attractive at the same time that they are becoming more accessible.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, nuclear weapons were the bedrock of
American war capabilities. They were the linchpin of defense
debate, procurement programs and arms control because the United
States faced another superpower _ one that conventional wisdom
feared could best it in conventional warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Today, no one cares about the MX missile or B-1 bomber, and
hardly anyone really cares about the Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty. In a manner that could only have seemed ludicrous during
the Cold War, proponents now rationalize the $2 billion B-2 as a
weapon for conventional war.
</P>
<P>
   What military planners are interested in is how to keep
adversaries from using low-tech weapons of mass destruction as an
``asymmetric'' means to counter U.S. conventional power, and how to
protect U.S. ground and naval forces abroad from WMD attacks.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the primary risk is not that enemies might lob some
nuclear or chemical weapons at U.S. armored battalions or ships,
awful as that would be. Rather, it is that they might attempt to
punish the United States by triggering catastrophes in American
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Chemicals are far more widely available than nuclear weapons
because the technology required to produce them is far simpler, and
large numbers of countries have undertaken chemical weapons
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Would the United States follow through and use nuclear weapons
against a country or group that had killed several thousand
Americans with deadly chemicals? It is hard to imagine breaking the
post-Nagasaki taboo in that situation. But schemes for conventional
military retaliation would not suffice without detracting from the
force of American deterrent threats.
</P>
<P>
   There would be a risk for the United States in setting a
precedent that someone could use any sort of weapons of mass
destruction against Americans without suffering similar destruction
in return. Limiting the range of deterrent alternatives available
to U.S. strategy will not necessarily cause deterrence to fail, but
it will certainly not strengthen it.
</P>
<P>
   One simple fact should worry Americans more about biological
than about nuclear or chemical arms: unlike either of the other
two, biological weapons combine maximum destructiveness and easy
availability. Nuclear arms have great killing capacity but are hard
to get; chemical weapons are easy to get but lack such killing
capacity; biological agents have both qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear weapons are not likely to be the ``WMD of choice'' for
non-state terrorist groups. They require huge investments and
targetable infrastructure, and are subject to credible threats by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   An aggrieved group that decides it wants to kill huge numbers of
Americans will find the mission easier to accomplish with anthrax
than with a nuclear explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of those who dealt with nuclear-weapons policy
during the Cold War adamantly opposed developing first-strike
options. Today, scarcely anyone looks to that old logic when
thinking about rogues or terrorists, and most hope to be able to
mount a disarming action against any group with highly lethal
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   As threats of terrorism are taken more seriously, interest will
grow in preemptive defense measures _ the most obvious of which is
intensified intelligence collection.
</P>
<P>
   Where this involves targeting groups within the United States
that might seem to be potential breeding grounds for terrorists,
controversies will arise over constitutional limits on invasion of
privacy or search and seizure.
</P>
<P>
   So long as the danger remains hypothetical, such controversies
will not be easily resolved. They have not come to the fore so far
because U.S. law enforcement has been unbelievably lucky in
apprehending terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   For the West, it is too late to turn off foreign resentments by
retreating, even if that were an acceptable course. Alienated
groups and governments would not stop blaming Washington for their
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Security is not all of a piece, and survival is only part of
security. But it is no longer prudent to assume that important
security interests complement each other as they did during the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The interest at the very core _ protecting the American homeland
from attack _ may now often be in conflict with security more
broadly conceived and with the interests that mandate promoting
American political values, economic interdependence, social
Westernization and stability in regions beyond Western Europe and
the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should not give up all its broader political
interests, but it should tread cautiously in areas _ especially the
Middle East _ where broader interests grate against the core
imperative of preventing mass destruction within America's borders.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   What do normal people feel is the main relief provided by the
end of the Cold War? It is that the danger of nuclear war is off
their backs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet today, ``weapons of mass destruction'' present more and
different things to worry about than during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   For one, nuclear arms are no longer a paramount concern, but
chemical and biological weapons have come to the fore. For another,
there is less danger of complete annihilation, but more danger of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Cold War is over and American and Russian nuclear
inventories are much smaller, there is less chance of an
apocalyptic exchange of many thousands of weapons. But the
probability that some smaller number of lethal weapons will be used
is growing.
</P>
<P>
   The points to keep in mind about the new world of mass
destruction are the following.
</P>
<P>
   _ First, the roles such weapons play in international conflict
are changing. They no longer represent the technological frontier
of warfare. Increasingly, they will be weapons of the weak states,
poorer countries or groups that militarily are at best
second-class.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, the mainstays of Cold War security policy _ deterrence
and arms control _ are not what they used to be. Some new threats
may not be deterrable, and the role of arms control in dealing with
weapons of mass destruction has been marginalized. In a few
instances, continuing devotion to deterrence and arms control may
have side effects that offset the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   _ Third, some of the responses most likely to cope with the
threats in novel ways will not find a warm welcome. The response
that should now be the highest priority is one long ignored,
opposed, or ridiculed: a serious civil-defense program to blunt the
effects of WMD if they are unleashed within the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most effective measures to prevent attacks within
the United States may also challenge traditional civil liberties if
pursued to the maximum. And the most troubling conclusion for
foreign policy as a whole is that reducing the odds of attacks in
the United States might require pulling back from involvement in
some foreign conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   American activism to guarantee international stability is,
paradoxically, the prime source of American vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   This was partly true in the Cold War, when the main danger that
nuclear weapons might detonate on U.S. soil sprang from strategic
engagement in Europe, Asia and the Middle East to deter attacks on
U.S. allies. But engagement then assumed a direct link between
regional stability and U.S. survival.
</P>
<P>
   The connection is less evident today, when there is no globally
threatening superpower or transnational ideology to be contained _
only an array of serious but entirely local disruptions. Today, as
the only nation acting to police areas outside its own region, the
United States makes itself a target for states or groups whose
aspirations are frustrated by U.S. power.
</P>
<P>
   When nuclear weapons were born, they represented the most
advanced military applications of science, technology, and
engineering. None but the great powers could hope to obtain them.
By now, however, nuclear arms have been around for more than half a
century, and chemical and biological weapons even longer.

<P>
   In recent years terrorist operations have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Airline hijackings have become rare because hijacked planes
cannot stay in the air forever and few countries today are willing
to let them land, thereby incurring the stigma of openly supporting
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorists too saw diminishing returns on hijackings. The trend
now seems to be away from attacking specific targets such as the
other side's officials and toward more indiscriminate killing.
</P>
<P>
   The belief has gained ground that terrorist missions by
volunteers bent on committing suicide constitute a radical new
departure, dangerous because they are impossible to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   But that is a myth, like the many others in which terrorism has
always been shrouded. The bomber willing and indeed eager to blow
himself up has appeared in all eras and cultural traditions,
espousing politics ranging from the leftism of the Baader-Meinhof
Gang in 1970s Germany to rightist extremism.
</P>
<P>
   When the Japanese military wanted kamikaze pilots at the end of
World War II, thousands of volunteers rushed to offer themselves.
The young Arab bombers on Jerusalem buses looking to be rewarded by
the virgins in Paradise are a link in an old chain.
</P>
<P>
   State-sponsored terrorism has not disappeared. Terrorists can no
longer count on the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies,
but it is clear that among Middle Eastern and North African
countries, some will definitely provide support.
</P>
<P>
   Tehran and Tripoli are less eager to argue that they have a
divine right to engage in terrorist operations outside their
borders. Indeed, the 1986 U.S. air strike against Libya and the
various boycotts against Libya and Iran had an effect.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Sudan, without fanfare, has become for
terrorists what the Barbary Coast was for pirates of another age: a
safe haven. Politically isolated and presiding over a disastrous
economy, the military government in Khartoum, backed by Muslim
leaders, believes that no one wants to become involved in Sudan and
thus it can get away with lending support to terrorists from many
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Such confidence is justified so long as terrorism is only a
nuisance. But when it becomes more than that, both terrorists and
their protectors come under great international pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the past few decades have witnessed the birth of
dozens of aggressive movements espousing varieties of nationalism,
religious fundamentalism, fascism and apocalyptic millenarianism,
from Hindu nationalists in India to neofascists in Europe and the
developing world to the Branch-Davidian cult of Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier fascists believed in military aggression and engaged
in a huge military buildup, but such a strategy has become too
expensive even for superpowers. Now, mail-order catalogs tempt
militants with readily available, far cheaper, unconventional as
well as conventional weapons _ ``the poor man's nuclear bomb,'' as
former Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani once called
them.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to nuclear arms, the weapons of mass destruction
include biological agents and man-made chemical compounds that
attack the nervous system, skin or blood.
</P>
<P>
   Governments have engaged in the production of chemical weapons
for almost a century and in the production of nuclear and
biological weapons for many decades, during which time
proliferation has been continuous and access ever easier.
</P>
<P>
   The means of delivery _ ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and
aerosols _ have also become far more effective. While in the past
missiles were deployed only in wars between states, recently they
have played a role in civil wars in Afghanistan and Yemen. Use by
terrorist groups is but one step further.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1970s most observers believed that stolen nuclear
material constituted the greatest threat in the escalation of
terrorist weapons, but many now think the danger is elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorist groups have investigated the use of poisons since the
19th century. The Aum Shinrikyo cult staged a poison gas attack in
March 1995 in the Tokyo subway. Exposure to the nerve gas sarin
killed ten people and injured 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other, more amateurish attempts in the United States and abroad
to experiment with chemical substances and biological agents for
use in terrorism have involved the toxin that causes botulism, the
poisonous protein rycin (twice), sarin (twice), bubonic plague
bacteria, typhoid bacteria, hydrogen cyanide, Vx (another nerve
gas), and possibly the Ebola virus.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical agents are not so easy to keep safely in stable
condition, and their dispersal depends largely on climatic factors.
The risk of contamination for the people handling them is high.
Many of the most lethal bacteria and spores do not survive well
outside the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, traditional terrorism rests on the heroic gesture,
on the willingness to sacrifice one's own life as proof of one's
idealism. Obviously there is not much heroism in spreading botulism
or anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   Since most terrorist groups are as interested in publicity as in
violence, and as publicity for a mass poisoning or nuclear bombing
would be far more unfavorable than for a focused conventional
attack, only terrorists who do not care about publicity will even
consider the applications of unconventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Broadly speaking, terrorists will not engage in overkill if
their traditional weapons _ the submachine gun and the conventional
bomb _ are sufficient to continue the struggle and achieve their
aims.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to use terrorist violence is not always a
rational one. If it were, there would be much less terrorism, since
terrorist activity seldom achieves its aims. What if, after years
of armed struggle and the loss of many of their militants,
terrorist groups see no progress?
</P>
<P>
   Despair could lead to giving up the armed struggle, or to
suicide. But it might also lead to a last desperate attempt to
defeat the hated enemy by arms not tried before.
</P>
<P>
   As one of Racine's heroes said of himself, their ``only hope
lies in their despair.''

   Airline hijackings have become rare because hijacked planes
cannot stay in the air forever and few countries today are willing
to let them land, thereby incurring the stigma of openly supporting
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorists too saw diminishing returns on hijackings. The trend
now seems to be away from attacking specific targets such as the
other side's officials and toward more indiscriminate killing.
</P>
<P>
   The belief has gained ground that terrorist missions by
volunteers bent on committing suicide constitute a radical new
departure, dangerous because they are impossible to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   But that is a myth, like the many others in which terrorism has
always been shrouded. The bomber willing and indeed eager to blow
himself up has appeared in all eras and cultural traditions,
espousing politics ranging from the leftism of the Baader-Meinhof
Gang in 1970s Germany to rightist extremism.
</P>
<P>
   When the Japanese military wanted kamikaze pilots at the end of
World War II, thousands of volunteers rushed to offer themselves.
The young Arab bombers on Jerusalem buses looking to be rewarded by
the virgins in Paradise are a link in an old chain.
</P>
<P>
   State-sponsored terrorism has not disappeared. Terrorists can no
longer count on the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies,
but it is clear that among Middle Eastern and North African
countries, some will definitely provide support.
</P>
<P>
   Tehran and Tripoli are less eager to argue that they have a
divine right to engage in terrorist operations outside their
borders. Indeed, the 1986 U.S. air strike against Libya and the
various boycotts against Libya and Iran had an effect.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Sudan, without fanfare, has become for
terrorists what the Barbary Coast was for pirates of another age: a
safe haven. Politically isolated and presiding over a disastrous
economy, the military government in Khartoum, backed by Muslim
leaders, believes that no one wants to become involved in Sudan and
thus it can get away with lending support to terrorists from many
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Such confidence is justified so long as terrorism is only a
nuisance. But when it becomes more than that, both terrorists and
their protectors come under great international pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the past few decades have witnessed the birth of
dozens of aggressive movements espousing varieties of nationalism,
religious fundamentalism, fascism and apocalyptic millenarianism,
from Hindu nationalists in India to neofascists in Europe and the
developing world to the Branch-Davidian cult of Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier fascists believed in military aggression and engaged
in a huge military buildup, but such a strategy has become too
expensive even for superpowers. Now, mail-order catalogs tempt
militants with readily available, far cheaper, unconventional as
well as conventional weapons _ ``the poor man's nuclear bomb,'' as
former Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani once called
them.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to nuclear arms, the weapons of mass destruction
include biological agents and man-made chemical compounds that
attack the nervous system, skin or blood.
</P>
<P>
   Governments have engaged in the production of chemical weapons
for almost a century and in the production of nuclear and
biological weapons for many decades, during which time
proliferation has been continuous and access ever easier.
</P>
<P>
   The means of delivery _ ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and
aerosols _ have also become far more effective. While in the past
missiles were deployed only in wars between states, recently they
have played a role in civil wars in Afghanistan and Yemen. Use by
terrorist groups is but one step further.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1970s most observers believed that stolen nuclear
material constituted the greatest threat in the escalation of
terrorist weapons, but many now think the danger is elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorist groups have investigated the use of poisons since the
19th century. The Aum Shinrikyo cult staged a poison gas attack in
March 1995 in the Tokyo subway. Exposure to the nerve gas sarin
killed ten people and injured 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other, more amateurish attempts in the United States and abroad
to experiment with chemical substances and biological agents for
use in terrorism have involved the toxin that causes botulism, the
poisonous protein rycin (twice), sarin (twice), bubonic plague
bacteria, typhoid bacteria, hydrogen cyanide, Vx (another nerve
gas), and possibly the Ebola virus.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical agents are not so easy to keep safely in stable
condition, and their dispersal depends largely on climatic factors.
The risk of contamination for the people handling them is high.
Many of the most lethal bacteria and spores do not survive well
outside the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, traditional terrorism rests on the heroic gesture,
on the willingness to sacrifice one's own life as proof of one's
idealism. Obviously there is not much heroism in spreading botulism
or anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   Since most terrorist groups are as interested in publicity as in
violence, and as publicity for a mass poisoning or nuclear bombing
would be far more unfavorable than for a focused conventional
attack, only terrorists who do not care about publicity will even
consider the applications of unconventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Broadly speaking, terrorists will not engage in overkill if
their traditional weapons _ the submachine gun and the conventional
bomb _ are sufficient to continue the struggle and achieve their
aims.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to use terrorist violence is not always a
rational one. If it were, there would be much less terrorism, since
terrorist activity seldom achieves its aims. What if, after years
of armed struggle and the loss of many of their militants,
terrorist groups see no progress?
</P>
<P>
   Despair could lead to giving up the armed struggle, or to
suicide. But it might also lead to a last desperate attempt to
defeat the hated enemy by arms not tried before.
</P>
<P>
   As one of Racine's heroes said of himself, their ``only hope
lies in their despair.''

   Reliance on air power has set the American way of war apart from
all others for well over half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries might field infantry, submariners or scientific
artillerists comparable in skill and numbers to America's.
</P>
<P>
   Only the United States, however, has engaged in a single-minded
and successful quest for air superiority in every conflict it has
fought since World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Air warfare remains distinctively American _ high-tech, cheap in
lives and, at least in theory, quick. To America's enemies _ past,
current and potential _ it is the distinctively American form of
military intimidation. Air warfare plays to the machine-mindedness
of American civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft can direct massive and accurate destructive force at
key points without having to maneuver cumbersome organizations on
land or sea.
</P>
<P>
   When American presidents use air power, they should either hurl
it with devastating lethality against a few targets _ say, a
full-scale meeting of an enemy war cabinet or senior military staff
_ or extensively enough to cause sharp and lasting pain to a
military and a society.
</P>
<P>
   The sprinkling of air strikes over an enemy will harden him
without hurting him and deprive the United States of an intangible
strategic asset.
</P>
<P>
   American leaders at the end of this century indeed have been
vouchsafed with a military instrument of a potency rarely known in
the history of war. But glib talk of revolutionary change obscures
the complexity of truly radical change in the conduct of war and,
worse, its inherent messiness and brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, air power is an unusually seductive form of military
strength, in part because, like modern courtship, it appears to
offer gratification without commitment.
</P>
<P>
   More than one commentator who had reservations about aerial
bombardment in the Persian Gulf War expressed a newfound belief in
its utility as a tool of U.S. foreign policy in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Lewis of The New York Times wrote during the gulf
conflict in disgust at the ruin wrought by aerial bombardment: ``We
should never again tolerate anyone who talks about `surgical
strikes.''' After that, however, he developed a keener appreciation
of air power, asserting, for example, that ``a few air strikes in
Dubrovnik'' would have stopped the Yugoslav horrors in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   It remains that many individuals came away from the gulf war
with a far healthier respect for air power, believing it had made
all the difference. Indeed it had. Some 52,000 air-to-surface
sorties delivered approximately 210,000 unguided bombs, 9,300
guided bombs, 5,400 guided air-to-surface missiles and 2,000
anti-radar missiles. American forces also hurled more than 300
cruise missiles at the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   To what effect?
</P>
<P>
   Of its 700 aircraft, the Iraqi air force lost 33 in the air;
approximately 140 perished in hardened aircraft shelters and more
than 120 were flown to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi air-defense system succumbed within days _ really,
hours _ to an extremely sophisticated attack. It managed to shoot
down only a tiny fraction of the attacking aircraft. Moreover, air
power had completely disrupted Iraqi logistics and immobilized the
Iraqi army.
</P>
<P>
   Although ground action necessarily consummated the final victory
for coalition forces, air power had made the final assault as
effortless as a wartime operation can be.
</P>
<P>
   If the claims of air power advocates are correct, the United
States, after the gulf war, acquired a military edge over
conventional opponents comparable to that exercised in 1898 by the
soldiers of Lord Kitchener against the sword-wielding dervishes of
the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after all that, the way to a U.S.-policed world order
might look remarkably smooth. Was the Persian Gulf war a major
departure in the history of warfare and does it point the way to
unshakable American military preeminence?
</P>
<P>
   The war saw the first extensive use of some new technologies.
The F-117 stealth fighter penetrated Iraqi radar safely and
secretly. The Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System
detected Iraqi trucks and tanks along highways in Kuwait. An array
of satellites gave unparalleled support to military commanders for
intelligence gathering, map-making, communication, navigation,
meteorology and missile-launch detection.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bulk of the work came from much older systems and
mundane technologies such as air refueling.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the weapons used in the Persian Gulf dated back two
decades or more. Air Force B-52 and Navy A-6 bombers had seen at
least 20 years of active service, although they employed newer
electronics. Guided bombs first appeared in the Vietnam War, when
U.S. aircraft dropped 4,000 or so on the Vietnamese communists.
</P>
<P>
   Even modern, first-line fighters such as the F-16 have been in
use for almost a decade.
</P>
<P>
   So the ``military-technical revolution'' sparkled in new
systems, but it drew as much on considerably more mature
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   And the respect it created for unbeatable American power has
not, in nearly a decade, faltered a bit.

<P>
   If a terrorist were to strike a U.S. city with a chemical or
biological agent, the Federal Bureau of Investigation would be
responsible for coordinating the response to the attack.
</P>
<P>
   A host of federal, state and local agencies would be mobilized
for the remediation effort, including the U.S. Army's Technical
Escort Unit (TEU). Part of the Army's Chemical and Biological
Defense Command (CBDCOM), the Aberdeen Proving Ground,
Maryland-based TEU has expertise and equipment found nowhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we're organized and equipped to deal with either a
chemical or biological device,'' said Lt. Col. Doug Norton, TEU
commander.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the capability to mitigate the effects of a device if
it has already functioned, or to render it safe if it hasn't
functioned. ... We also have the capability to search for a device,
take samples to determine if chemical or biological agents have
been released and, if we locate a device, we have the capability to
remove and transport it to the appropriate lab for
identification.''
</P>
<P>
   At any time, Norton said, a basic chemical and
biological-response team is ready to respond within four hours to
any incident anywhere in the United States. In all, the TEU has 83
military members and 99 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Domestic Preparedness Program, under which
``emergency responders'' from 120 U.S. cities are receiving
training in how to respond to an attack involving chemical,
biological or nuclear elements, is the most visible aspect of the
government's efforts to prepare for an urban nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   The training program is an interagency effort heavily supported
by the Defense Department through the Army Chemical and Biological
Defense Command. Essentially a ``train the trainer'' program, the
effort is aimed at policemen, firemen, hazardous materials
handlers, medical personnel and others who would be called upon to
respond to a so-called ``domestic WMD attack.'' It introduces them
to what they need to know and do _ beyond the actions they would
normally take _ to protect themselves while saving others' lives.
</P>
<P>
   The training program, as well as the rapid-response team,
springs from requirements in the 1997 Defense Authorization Act to
develop capabilities to aid in the event of a chemical or
biological incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the Army's Technical Escort Unit brings a great
deal to the table. Its members have years of expertise in crisis
management,'' said Jim Warrington, program director for domestic
preparedness at the CBDCOM. ``There's also the Marine Corps'
Chemical Biological Incident Response Force.''
</P>
<P>
   This year $43 million is being spent on the Pentagon's Domestic
Preparedness Program; next year $49 million is set aside for the
effort. ``We anticipate completing the training for all 120 cities
by fiscal year 2001,'' Warrington said.
</P>
<P>
   After an initial course of instruction in Denver in May 1997,
the original training concept was refined, and by mid-April, 23
sessions had been conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we've gone into a city, we've fine-tuned the
training,'' Warrington said. ``Usually the training lasts for one
week.'' The instructors include active-duty military and
non-military emergency personnel and Army Reserve teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at precautions in Israel, where recent scares from Iraq
placed the public in a fearful dilemma, a wide range of
countermeasures are either available or under development to
confront even the most horrifying chemical or biological threat.
</P>
<P>
   These include a highly capable passive defense organization
reaching to all levels, with shelters, personal equipment in the
hands of all the population and a highly professional medical
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Further, an experienced pharmaceutical industry can quickly
produce sufficient antidotes on short notice and distribute these
to the population within days. This was done during the most recent
crisis, together with an all-out effort by global purchasing agents
who obtained additional items abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The danger from a terrorist suicide attack is also well known in
Israel. Not much can be done to prevent these attacks other than
constant vigilance and the political resolve to move quickly
against known threats.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of such future attacks using chemical or
biological agents cannot be neglected, and effective measures to
give early warning or to initiate countermeasures must be
considered.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's early-warning defense system is geared to detect
suicide flyers, remote-controlled drones and converted
crop-spraying aircraft trying to sneak through, but these threats
are considered less likely.
</P>
<P>
   While Israel is a highly organized nation constantly on alert
for mass terror attacks, it has large squatter regions surrounding
already densely populated cities, increasing any risk.
</P>
<P>
   One can only hope that reason will continue to prevail _ not
only in the region known as the cradle of civilization _ but
everywhere.

<P>
   If a terrorist were to strike a U.S. city with a chemical or
biological agent, the Federal Bureau of Investigation would be
responsible for coordinating the response to the attack.
</P>
<P>
   A host of federal, state and local agencies would be mobilized
for the remediation effort, including the U.S. Army's Technical
Escort Unit (TEU). Part of the Army's Chemical and Biological
Defense Command (CBDCOM), the Aberdeen Proving Ground,
Maryland-based TEU has expertise and equipment found nowhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we're organized and equipped to deal with either a
chemical or biological device,'' said Lt. Col. Doug Norton, TEU
commander.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the capability to mitigate the effects of a device if
it has already functioned, or to render it safe if it hasn't
functioned. ... We also have the capability to search for a device,
take samples to determine if chemical or biological agents have
been released and, if we locate a device, we have the capability to
remove and transport it to the appropriate lab for
identification.''
</P>
<P>
   At any time, Norton said, a basic chemical and
biological-response team is ready to respond within four hours to
any incident anywhere in the United States. In all, the TEU has 83
military members and 99 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Domestic Preparedness Program, under which
``emergency responders'' from 120 U.S. cities are receiving
training in how to respond to an attack involving chemical,
biological or nuclear elements, is the most visible aspect of the
government's efforts to prepare for an urban nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   The training program is an interagency effort heavily supported
by the Defense Department through the Army Chemical and Biological
Defense Command. Essentially a ``train the trainer'' program, the
effort is aimed at policemen, firemen, hazardous materials
handlers, medical personnel and others who would be called upon to
respond to a so-called ``domestic WMD attack.'' It introduces them
to what they need to know and do _ beyond the actions they would
normally take _ to protect themselves while saving others' lives.
</P>
<P>
   The training program, as well as the rapid-response team,
springs from requirements in the 1997 Defense Authorization Act to
develop capabilities to aid in the event of a chemical or
biological incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the Army's Technical Escort Unit brings a great
deal to the table. Its members have years of expertise in crisis
management,'' said Jim Warrington, program director for domestic
preparedness at the CBDCOM. ``There's also the Marine Corps'
Chemical Biological Incident Response Force.''
</P>
<P>
   This year $43 million is being spent on the Pentagon's Domestic
Preparedness Program; next year $49 million is set aside for the
effort. ``We anticipate completing the training for all 120 cities
by fiscal year 2001,'' Warrington said.
</P>
<P>
   After an initial course of instruction in Denver in May 1997,
the original training concept was refined, and by mid-April, 23
sessions had been conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we've gone into a city, we've fine-tuned the
training,'' Warrington said. ``Usually the training lasts for one
week.'' The instructors include active-duty military and
non-military emergency personnel and Army Reserve teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at precautions in Israel, where recent scares from Iraq
placed the public in a fearful dilemma, a wide range of
countermeasures are either available or under development to
confront even the most horrifying chemical or biological threat.
</P>
<P>
   These include a highly capable passive defense organization
reaching to all levels, with shelters, personal equipment in the
hands of all the population and a highly professional medical
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Further, an experienced pharmaceutical industry can quickly
produce sufficient antidotes on short notice and distribute these
to the population within days. This was done during the most recent
crisis, together with an all-out effort by global purchasing agents
who obtained additional items abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The danger from a terrorist suicide attack is also well known in
Israel. Not much can be done to prevent these attacks other than
constant vigilance and the political resolve to move quickly
against known threats.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of such future attacks using chemical or
biological agents cannot be neglected, and effective measures to
give early warning or to initiate countermeasures must be
considered.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's early-warning defense system is geared to detect
suicide flyers, remote-controlled drones and converted
crop-spraying aircraft trying to sneak through, but these threats
are considered less likely.
</P>
<P>
   While Israel is a highly organized nation constantly on alert
for mass terror attacks, it has large squatter regions surrounding
already densely populated cities, increasing any risk.
</P>
<P>
   One can only hope that reason will continue to prevail _ not
only in the region known as the cradle of civilization _ but
everywhere.

COMMENTARY: THE WAR AGAINST IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NIRELAND-BOMBING) 
(js) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   First Belfast had to be visited again, not to see but to listen.
Then, across the border invisible but for surveillance towers, to
the Republic of Ireland _ south to Dublin and the city and county
of Cork, westward through the mists of Kerry and then east and
north across the country toward Dublin again _ all the while
listening, listening, to friends and their friends, experiencing a
special happiness I never thought I would taste in my lifetime of
journalism. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in any country where the people had been
slaughtering each other for generations, I was certain that real
peace was close enough to feel and very likely was already here.
Although the war of the Irish is not formally over, a new
government is already in the making in the North. The politicians,
the police and the huge majority of voters shouting in referendum
wanted the latest cease-fire to become peace, true and lasting,
real and forever. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My happiness was for the Irish and what they were doing for
themselves. And it was for their openhearted embraces to America
for what President Clinton and his emissaries had been doing to
help bring together the Roman Catholics of the North who wanted
Irish partition ended and Protestants who see the North and
themselves as part of Britain.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The agreement worked out on Good Friday presents no final
settlements _ the weakness of Oslo. But with real concessions from
both sides, it knits North and South closer. It gives the large
Catholic minority in the North a real share of political power. I
met only three people among all I talked to who did not think
formal peace, arms down and surrendered, was more than a few months
away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a workingmen's club in Belfast I met David Ervine, a leader
of a Protestant political party and its paramilitary unit _ the
local euphemism for terrorists _ a small version of Sinn Fein's
Irish Republican Army.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once when he was young, police caught him running from a truck.
He cried out that a bomb was aboard. They tied him to a long rope
and ordered him to defuse the bomb. Then they tied him to almost
six years in jail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Years later, he said, he heard somebody shout, ``David Ervine
has been killed.'' It was another David Ervine, but he knew that as
long as Catholics and Protestants were killing each other, one day
the Ervine who had heard the shout would hear no more.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As time passed, he decided that unless Protestants and Catholics
shared political power they would all be prisoners, all targets.
The day after we met, he announced that his ``paramilitaries''
considered the war to be over, not someday but now.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The happiness of everybody in Ireland faded at 3:10 p.m. last
Saturday. Staying with friends in the county of Tipperary, we heard
the news _ a bomb had exploded in the village of Omagh in Northern
Ireland. Hundreds injured, arms and legs left bleeding in the
streets, 28 people dead, including 23 women and children, but not
counting the children who happened to be in the womb of a woman
killed as she shopped the stores of Omagh. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two days later a gang of terrorists calling themselves the Real
IRA said they had done the deed. They whined that they had really
not meant to hurt anybody, which made Ireland sick with fury. They
are a gang of terror specialists that split away from the Irish
Republican Army when its political arm, Sinn Fein, backed the peace
agreement. The bombing was beyond any single act of atrocity
Ireland had known.
</P>
<P>
   But it also created something else Ireland had not known.
Protestant politicians came to the funerals with Catholic fellow
members of the new Northern legislature. David Trimble, the
Protestant top minister of the legislature, drove to Dublin to see
and consult with the prime minister of the Irish Republic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The prince of Wales walked and talked without fuss or ceremony
among the broken-hearted and left behind a small simple bouquet _
the best moments of the House of Windsor in a long time, said all. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Laws against terrorists were tightened, and so were Irish hearts
and determination. Yet who can say there will be no more bombings? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But everybody can say and many do, often, that terrorists are
now at war not with Catholics or Protestants, but with the nation
of Ireland. They say that is a war the killers cannot win and pray
that God will hear the Irish nation.

 &HT;    ATTACKS FOLLOWED GROWING CONCERNS ABOUT PRODUCTION OF DEADLY VX
GAS IN SUDAN
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH and ANDREW ALEXANDER
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. attack on a chemical plant in Sudan
Thursday followed reports of growing concern among Western
intelligence agencies that facilities for the production of deadly
VX nerve gas had been secretly shipped to Sudan from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Jane's Intelligence Review, published by the authoritative,
London-based weapons information company, reported earlier this
week that United Nations arms inspectors and U.S. intelligence
officials believe equipment for production of VX that disappeared
from Iraq in mid-1995 and wound up in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Besides striking purported terrorist camps operated in
Afghanistan by renegade Saudi businessman and self-described
terrorism sponsor Osama bin Laden, U.S. Tomahawk cruise missiles
were used to bomb a ``Shifa Phamaceuticals'' chemical plant in
Khartoum, the Sudanese capital.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen and a senior intelligence
official told reporters Thursday the facility was turning out
precursor chemicals for VX production.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence official also told reporters at a Pentagon
briefing that the plant was part of a Sudanese enterprise formally
known as ``the Military-Industrial Complex,'' which has been
financially supported by Bin Laden. Sudanese officials insisted the
plant produced only pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   VX is an abbreviation for a 62-letter chemical term (which
contains no Vs and no Xs). Colorless and odorless, the chemical is
the most toxic nerve agent known, many times deadlier than hydrogen
cyanide gas. By blocking an enzyme that regulates nerve impulses,
it causes uncontrolled spasms and within minutes, death.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do know is that this facility that was targeted in
Khartoum produced the precursor chemicals that would allow the
production of a type of VX nerve agent,'' Cohen said. The
intelligence official at Cohen's briefing went further:
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we know that Bin Laden has made financial contributions
to the Sudanese Military-Industrial Complex. That's a distinct
entity of which, we believe, the Shifa pharmaceutical facility is
part. We know with high confidence that Shifa produces a precursor
that is unique to the production of VX. . .''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Butler, chairman of the United Nations Special
Commission that oversees the destruction of Iraqi weapons, has said
he believes 20 shipping containers with VX production equipment
disappeared from Iraq in mid-1995.
</P>
<P>
   Jayne's Intelligence Review reported Monday that U.S.
intelligence officials believe these containers were taken to
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine also reported on minutes of a two-day secret
meeting in Khartoum last October at which Sudanese officials
purportedly were assured of financial support from Bin Laden for
construction of a ``chemical and bacterial weapons factory'' in
Kubar, a suburb of Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
   Participants at the meeting agreed that the plant should be
brought into production ``as soon as possible,'' the magazine said
minutes of the meeting showed.
</P>
<P>
   Javed Ali, principal author of Jane's ``Chemical and Biological
Defense Guidebook,'' said VX has been around for about 50 years,
but only two countries, Russia and Iraq, have ever acknowledged
producing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not cutting edge technology,'' Ali said in an
interview. ``The British first developed the chemical in the late
1940s.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the chemicals that become VX when mixed together are
widely produced for peaceful reasons in many countries, especially
in the manufacture of pesticides, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob May, a farmer from eastern Arkansas who is in Sudan with a
group of Americans studying Christianity there, said Thursday that
he believes the factory was used exclusively to manufacture
pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have met some doctors here and they say the plant provides
90 percent of all medicines in this country,'' said May, who was
reached by phone in Khartoum several hours after the attack.
</P>
<P>
   May said the mood in Khartoum Thursday night was one of
puzzlement more than anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question in the Sudanese peoples' minds is: 'What in the
world does this have to do with Osama bin Laden?''' Why would the
U.S. direct an attack on this city (when) in fact they exiled him
from Sudan two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's attack is ``going to get the people aroused'' in the
coming days, he said. ``I think it may have been a mistake. It's
certainly put a lot of puzzlement on people's faces. ``
</P>
<P>
   But a security official at a downtown Khartoum hotel suggested
otherwise. Asked in a telephone interview what was produced at the
factory, he said: ``Between you and me, chemicals. They could be
used for chemical weapons. I know because I have very wide eyes. I
can tell when I look.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that in recent years Libyans had worked at the factory,
ostensibly producing insecticides.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very clever here,'' he said, suggesting that the
insecticide production was a cover. ``They can hide it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a curious coincidence of names caused the chairman of
a Syrian pharmaceutical manufacturer to announce following the
bombing that he would attempt to sue the Sudanese pharmaceutical
company for ``stealing our name.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard of these people because we export drugs to Iraq
under U.N. approval,'' said Imad Sabouni, chairman of Shifa
Pharmaceutical Industries of Aleppo, Syria. ``They also attempted
to sell to Iraq and that is when we learned that they also use the
name Shifa.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabouni also said in a telephone interview that his company had
no relationship with Bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God! Oh, my God! What is going on?'' Sabouni cried when
told that a pharmaceutical company with the same name as his
company's had been bombed for producing nerve gas precursors.
``Really, we do not have any relation with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabouni said that in Arabic the word ``Shifa'' means ``cure from
illness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When people are sick, they lie in bed and cry, 'Please, God,
give me me Shifa,''' he said.

THE OCEAN _ SOME VERSION OF IT, ANYWAY _ MOVES INLAND

 (ATTN: Kan., Tenn., N.M.)  (smw)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ With the Rocky Mountains looming to the west, plumbers
at Ocean Journey, a $93 million aquarium scheduled to open next
summer, are installing the ultimate faux beach: an acrylic
walk-through tube that will be pounded with waves of salt water
while floors vibrate and hidden atomizers spray sea scents.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, beach volleyball enthusiasts are flocking to The
Island _ a newly opened warehouse filled with 10,000 tons of
imported sand and decorated with palm trees and seascape murals.
And just north of Denver, about 4,000 visitors frolic daily in 3.5
million gallons of water at Water World, one of the nation's
largest water parks, spread over 64 acres of once-arid plains.
</P>
<P>
   Denver, landlocked and 1,000 road miles from the nearest ocean,
has always suffered from a mild municipal inferiority complex. Yes,
it is the gateway to some of the nation's most dramatic mountains,
but where is the beach? This year, the Mile High City is fighting
back against geographic determinism.
</P>
<P>
   In early August, Ocean Journey received its first shipment of
1,000 tropical fish, probably the largest number of salt water fish
seen here since 65 million B.C., when an inland sea covered this
patch of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``For kids who have never been to the ocean, this is going to be
great,'' Judy Petersen-Fleming, one of the founders of Ocean
Journey, said recently as she led visitors through the three-story
shell of the aquarium, on Water Street. ``There will be coral in
front of them, sharks overhead.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver appears to be leading a heartland trend toward creating
ersatz oceans. Half a million people, or one out of four residents
of greater Denver, are expected to swim, sun and play this summer
at Water World, which calls its latest attraction the Colorado Wave
_ ``the world's first dual ocean wave surfing simulator.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Best water park I've been to, and I've been to about 20,''
said Jim Anderson, a local resident, after a day at the park with
his 8-year-old son, Mark. Anderson, who vacationed in Hawaii last
May, said he preferred the park's big, simulated waves over the
real thing. ``You get a great one every five minutes _ that's
better than the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, attendance at the nation's water parks has
doubled, to 61 million last year from 30 million in 1987. Initial
figures for this summer show a continued increase, according to the
World Waterpark Association, a trade group in Overland Park, Kan.,
near the nation's geographical center.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the water park boom has taken place in the nation's
interior, said Marci McNeal, spokeswoman for the group, which
represents the nation's 964 water parks. Similarly, aquariums are
moving inland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, aquariums tend to be in coastal settings,''
said Charles Redmon, a senior partner for Cambridge Seven
Associates, the world's largest aquarium design firm. But in recent
years, Redmon said, his company has designed an aquarium for
Chattanooga, Tenn., a river city, and conducted studies for
aquariums in Denver and the Great Lakes area. It is now working on
a rain forest garden for Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, an aquarium opened in Albuquerque, N.M. In Salt Lake
City, planners are studying a proposal for a $40 million aquarium
that would open in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the sand and the waves have come to Denver,
marketers are very aware that many residents can still be lured to
the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``United Airlines is thrilled to help bring the ocean to
Colorado,'' said Roger Gibson, the airline's regional vice
president, when he gave Ocean Journey a $1.8 million check. What
the executive of Denver's dominant airline left unsaid was that
United would also be thrilled to pack its nine daily direct flights
to San Diego, the nearest beach city to Denver, slightly over two
hours by jet.
</P>
<P>
   At Ocean Journey, visitors will follow the trail of the Colorado
River, from drops dripping from icicles on Colorado's Continental
Divide to the warm waters of Mexico's Sea of Cortez. Thus, it is no
accident that the Sea of Cortez exhibit is sponsored by Mexicana
Airlines, which maintains direct flights between Denver and three
Sea of Cortez resort towns: Los Cabos, Mazatlan and Puerto
Vallarta.
</P>
<P>
   So although people fly from around the nation to ski in the
Colorado Rockies every winter, a small counter-movement of
Coloradans fly 1,100 miles south to Mexico's Pacific beaches.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some of Mexico's Pacific resort villages are starting
to look like Denver-by-the-sea, with Coloradans having their own
condominiums and volleyball tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of people who visit the beach each year, but
live in the mountains,'' said Tom Davenport, who started The Island
after taking ``volleyball vacation'' groups to the beaches of
Puerto Vallarta and Ixtapa.
</P>
<P>
   To give barefoot players a tropical feeling in the depths of a
Colorado winter, The Island will use gas heaters to warm the air
and infrared heaters to warm the sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wanted to do 12 months a year, what they could do only
4 months a year,'' Davenport said.

<P>
   Janice Ruell started worrying about when to send her third
child, Rosemary, to kindergarten even before the baby was born.
</P>
<P>
   Her first and second children had both arrived several weeks
later than expected, so when she went into labor in late August,
only a couple of days after her due date, Janice sat up on the
delivery table and shouted, ``She made the cutoff!''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later Rosemary's late-summer birthday did, in fact,
mean that she could begin kindergarten just as she turned 5, making
her one of the youngest kids in the class.
</P>
<P>
   Janice's older children had spring birthdays, and she couldn't
help but focus on the developmental differences between Rosemary
and her other children.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first two kids seemed further along in their intellectual
development when kindergarten came up,'' Janice recalls.
``Rosemary's sister wanted to go to kindergarten so badly that we
had to mark off each week on a calendar from her April birthday to
the first day of school, the following September. I was expecting
to see that same burning desire from Rosemary, but I've noticed
that she often has trouble thinking about the unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult for most parents to determine with absolute
certainty their children's readiness for kindergarten. Kids
approaching their fifth birthday can take large developmental
strides and acquire a good deal of self-confidence between spring
registration time and the first day of school at the end of the
summer. And the fact that parents get so much advice on the issue
can sometimes make the decision even more overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is contradictory at best: ``It helps to
be the oldest in the class,'' ``You can get ahead if you start
younger,'' ``Keep young boys out a year,'' ``Children should be
able to tie their shoes, write their names and count up to 10.''
</P>
<P>
   How is a concerned parent to sort out the most important factors
in making the decision?
</P>
<P>
   The three kids described below had parents who reached different
conclusions about the timing of early schooling. Though the
decisions differed, they each led to a successful kindergarten
experience.
 &UR; ROSEMARY'S STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary's parents ultimately decided to send her to
kindergarten despite the fact that she was likely to be one of the
youngest kids in the class. Her father, Steve, didn't doubt
Rosemary's readiness for one second.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so enthusiastic about learning,'' he says. ``I thought
we should take advantage of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary's mother eventually agreed and was happy about the
decision, which was also influenced by friends' experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost embarrassing,'' Janice admits, ``but there's a
certain social pressure on parents as well as children. Rosemary's
neighborhood friend has the same birthday, and her mother never
considered keeping her out of kindergarten for a year. Rosemary
would have been upset if her friend went to kindergarten and she
didn't. And I felt that Rosemary was as ready as her friend was.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice also talked to Rosemary's teachers at Chelmsford
Children's School, a private day-care and preschool program in
Chelmsford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all felt Rosemary was ready for kindergarten,'' says Dianne
Sadowski, Rosemary's preschool teacher. ``She had no difficulty
separating from her mother and father and showed a fair amount of
self-confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The teachers in Rosemary's preschool reassured her mother that
such social skills as communicating thoughts, listening, following
instructions, sharing and making transitions from one activity to
another are more important than mastery of the alphabet in helping
children to absorb what kindergarten has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosemary started out the school year on the quiet side,'' her
Harrington Elementary School kindergarten teacher, Dora Bungard,
says. ``She was absorbing things, but she wasn't ready to volunteer
and share her knowledge. Then she went through this magical
transition that often happens in late winter, and now she is really
a class leader.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child learns classroom routines and develops a trusting
relationship with the teacher, she demonstrates increasing
confidence in her ability to master tasks in kindergarten. At the
same time, a child's large and small motor skills, attention span
and listening skills continue to develop.
</P>
<P>
   In Rosemary's case, the ``magical transition'' included an
increase in self-confidence and progress in her ability to handle
pencil and paper and perform other small motor tasks.
 &UR; NICHOLAS' STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is separation anxiety a reason to wait? Camille Lema, a mother
of two from Durham, Conn., opted to wait a year before sending her
son, Nicholas, who has a late-December birthday, to kindergarten.
Nicholas' parents made the decision mostly because he'd insisted
that his mother stay with him for a large part of the day during
his entire first year of preschool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Academically, he knew a lot, and he played well with others,
but he just didn't appear ready to move on,'' Camille says.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to separate confidently from parents is something
that develops over time at a child's own pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children who have the hardest time in kindergarten are the
ones with big separation anxiety,'' says Diane Kischell, director
of the Wesleyan University day-care and preschool in Middletown,
Conn. ``If they worry all day long, then they are not going to be
connected with the school process.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas' difficulties with separation indicated that the
demands of kindergarten, the school bus and a new setting would be
more than he could handle. At the end of his first preschool year,
he was still challenged by the experience.
</P>
<P>
   His parents' hunch that he wasn't ready for kindergarten was
shared by his preschool teacher, Kathy Meyering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicholas underwent a metamorphosis during his second year of
preschool,'' she recalls. ``He began to jump into the day and he
became very comfortable with his classmates, at times even taking a
leadership role in dramatic play.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas developed the ability to separate from his parents in
his own time. The way they supported him gave him the security and
confidence he needed to successfully negotiate kindergarten at
Brewster Elementary School a year later, at 5 years, 9 months. When
the first day of school finally rolled around, Nicholas was excited
to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a kind, sensitive boy,'' says Ann Rau, Nicholas'
kindergarten teacher. ``He came to our class with some strong
preacademic skills, but he never outgrew kindergarten by being a
little older.''
 &UR; ERIC'S STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a mid-October birthday, Eric Wenz narrowly missed the Ohio
kindergarten cutoff date of Sept. 30. In the Kenston school
district, where the Wenz family lives, parents of children born
between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31 can apply for early kindergarten
entrance. Admission is based on a written application, a visit to
the child's preschool by elementary-school staff, an interview and
a series of standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   While most potential kindergartners are not required to go
through such an extensive entrance process, many school districts,
like Eric's, hold regular kindergarten screenings in early spring,
at which parents and children meet kindergarten teachers, speech
and language specialists, school nurses and other school personnel
who can help sort out various questions about readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric showed some abilities that seemed far beyond his age, and
yet he's still a little boy,'' Eric's mother, Margie, says. ``His
emotional maturity was the biggest unknown for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The evaluation process for early admission was lengthy but
helpful, Margie says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric took it all in stride,'' she recalls. ``We could see him
becoming more and more confident, and by the time of his testing, I
knew he was ready. Now we have to get used to the idea of our last
child going off to school!''
 &UR; THE BOTTOM LINE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When to send a child to kindergarten can seem a momentous
decision to parents, who hope their child will feel secure,
confident and open to the learning experience. While many parents
may worry, the fact is that most healthy, age-eligible children
will thrive in a good kindergarten setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child who has been talked to, who has been questioned and
who has been given answers to questions, a child who has been read
to and who has learned to share and play with other children and to
take turns is more successful right from the beginning,'' says
Carol Aikenhead, past president of the Kindergarten Association of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Five-year-old Rosemary knows the feeling of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like kindergarten, and I learn a lot of stuff,'' she says
enthusiastically. ``All of my new friends are here, and my teacher
smiles. When it is a kindergarten day, I feel happy.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 c.1996 Family Circle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Mark Schubart was dean of New York's famed Juilliard School
of Music, he was visited in his office one day by a distraught
mother pulling along her little boy.
</P>
<P>
   What could she do about him? she asked. Here the boy was,
already 4 years old, and his piano repertoire consisted of only 34
pieces!
</P>
<P>
   Schubart, now chairman of the Lincoln Center Institute, which
trains teachers to use the arts to expand young minds, still shakes
his head over the encounter. Clearly, some people don't know when
to stop pushing their kids.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, parents with a more measured
appreciation of how to boost their children's learning power are
tuning in to a host of exciting new findings. Music, in particular,
is emerging as both a pathway and a stimulant to intellectual
growth.
</P>
<P>
   But the visual and dramatic arts can play a big role too, along
with other approaches that are revolutionizing childhood education.
On television, that master teacher ``Sesame Street'' has been
applying some of the latest research in maximizing youngsters'
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Watch carefully and you'll see how lessons on the same topics
are increasingly being clustered for reinforcement. The letter of
the day _ D _ might be shown in different ways: outlined in
candles, and then set to music in clay animation. Preschoolers who
have trouble grasping the lesson in a linguistic way may get it
through music or movement or other presentations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea,'' said Celia Genishi, chairwoman of curriculum and
development at Columbia University's Teachers College, ``is to give
children many different entry points for learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving all this is a new understanding of intelligence.
Increasingly, experts are redefining intelligence as more than
linguistic and mathematical ability, the traditional yardsticks.
Rather, they say, it takes many forms.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to specialists such as Howard Gardner, a professor of
education at Harvard who is widely credited with the theory of
multiple intelligences, and Daniel Goleman, author of the
best-selling book ``Emotional Intelligence'' (Bantam Books,
$19.95), our understanding of the workings and expression of
intelligence has widened.
</P>
<P>
   Now we include creative powers and the ability to understand
oneself and others along with the rest of the natural and spiritual
world, as well as the simple ability to get along with other
people.
 &UR; SEVEN KINDS OF INTELLIGENCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gardner makes a case for at least seven different intelligences:
linguistic (poet), logical-mathematical (scientist), musical
(composer), spatial (architect), bodily-kinesthetic (dancer,
athlete), interpersonal (salesman, teacher) and intrapersonal
(those with a highly developed sense of self).
</P>
<P>
   The implications of this expanded view of intelligence have been
sweeping. No longer must the label ``smart'' be reserved for the
best readers, writers and counters in the classroom. Now youngsters
who can follow complex dance steps or drum rhythms, organize games
or soothe conflicts with their schoolmates can be recognized as
possessing different types of intelligence. And these skills can be
utilized to learn the ever-crucial reading, writing and arithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   Although scientists are still struggling to understand the
developing brain, there is widespread agreement that the preschool
years open a mental window through which learning can flood in at a
rate never again duplicated in life. Opportunities not exploited at
this time can never be made up.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first four years of life, the child's brain grows to
fully two-thirds of its adult size, evolving at a faster rate than
it ever will again. And the stimulation present at that time will
have a lot to say about the kind of adult the child will become.
 &UR; WHAT PARENTS CAN DO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one famous 1960s experiment, scientists at the University of
California at Berkeley raised two groups of lab animals, one in a
setting of wheels and ladders and toys, the other in an
impoverished environment. After several months the animals in the
enriched setting not only were in better health and performed
better, but also had grown larger brains.
</P>
<P>
   So what can parents do to boost their children's learning power?
</P>
<P>
   + Expose them early to music and art.
</P>
<P>
   This should be done not in hopes of uncovering a prodigy, though
that may possibly happen, but because research has found links
between intellectual achievement and musical training and ability.
</P>
<P>
   How early? Well, some mothers-to-be make a point of listening to
Mozart and other soothing symphonists. Their hope is to predispose
their offspring to high culture, although science has yet to
confirm that this works.
</P>
<P>
   Because financially hard-pressed schools around the country have
cut arts programs left and right, parents have to do more to take
up the slack. Music lessons in piano or violin, two of the most
popular instruments for children to learn, can be started as early
as preschool.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some experts say it's almost never too soon to begin
and, for those with true talent, starting too late may mean never
fully exploiting their gifts. The idea is to train children so
early that their technique becomes intuitional.
</P>
<P>
   + Take children to live performances.
</P>
<P>
   There's no better way of exciting them about the arts. Give them
a good view of the conductor. Let them peer into the orchestra,
before or after the performance. Go backstage afterward if
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Many young people's theaters make a practice of letting the
actors in costume mingle with the audience after the curtain. Allow
time after the show for your kids to shake hands with the stars.
Or, for a look behind the scenes of a show or concert, try to
attend a dress rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   + Do dance exercises with young children at home.
</P>
<P>
   The urge to dance and move to rhythm is strong in many children.
Isadora Duncan liked to say she learned to dance in her mother's
womb.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from formal ballet and dance instruction, parents can put
on some music and have children dance or skip to the changing
rhythms. Ask them to imitate sailboats or gliding seagulls. Teach
beats with a makeshift drum.
</P>
<P>
   + At museums, look for ``please touch me'' exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing teaches children faster than hands-on experiences.
Children's museums are particularly rich in such fun, educational
displays.
</P>
<P>
   Many museums also offer children's art programs. Instructors
lead young visitors to a sculpture or painting gallery, talk a
little about the work on display and then give out paint, paper and
crayons with which the children try their own versions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, parents can do similar things at home using art
books, art supplies and collage materials they have at hand _
anything from cut-up magazines and newspapers to old photos, pieces
of fabric and buttons.
</P>
<P>
   + Buy your child an inexpensive camera.
</P>
<P>
   Older children are often intrigued by photography. The pictures
they take can be developed inexpensively at neighborhood film
depots and used by parents as a springboard into discussions about
color and design: What makes some pictures nicer than others? How
does an artist pick a subject and angle?
</P>
<P>
   + Expose children to other languages at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   With their young brains programmed to soak up information at a
rate they will never achieve again, preschoolers can painlessly lay
the foundations for multilingualism. A foreign language that they
experience now will never sound completely strange to them again
and will be picked up much more quickly in later years.
</P>
<P>
   Research increasingly supports these recommendations. In one
recent study, four classes of first- and second-graders in West
Orange, N.J., were taught music using a highly structured and
demanding program pioneered 60 years ago by the Hungarian composer
Zoltan Kodaly. Their art instruction was also particularly
challenging. Four other classes took conventional music and art.
</P>
<P>
   After two years, the enriched classes had doubled the percentage
of pupils performing at grade level in math, to more than
three-quarters of the class. The other classes had lower gains.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits seem to endure. In profiles of test-takers, the
College Board found that those who studied or played music scored
an average of 51 points higher on the verbal portion of the SAT and
39 points higher on the math portion.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, at the University of California at Irvine,
psychologist Frances Rauscher and neuroscientist Gordon Shaw found
that preschoolers who took keyboard lessons for eight months
boosted their IQ scores on spatial tests by 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rauscher and Shaw reported, college students
who listened to a Mozart sonata for 10 minutes performed better on
spatial IQ tests _ a benefit termed ``the Mozart effect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Music excites the inherent brain patterns and enhances their
use in complex reasoning tasks,'' the researchers concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The visual arts, too, pay intellectual dividends. Philip
Yenawine of Development Through Art, former director of education
for the Museum of Modern Art, reported that students who learned to
critically discuss paintings in a museum did better in social
studies and other subjects. They learned to formulate theorems,
draw meaning from abstract ideas and communicate thoughts. And
their writing improved.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nothing can turn off youngsters faster than forced
marches down endless museum corridors. One clever way of focusing
children's attention is to buy them postcards of works of art and
then challenge them to find the originals on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Ask open-ended questions such as: What's happening in this
picture? What do you see in it?
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for any special answer _ just signs of thinking.
</P>

ORDER HALTS TESTIMONY IN CASES ON BARON'S COLLAPSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prosecutors have been granted a court order that
temporarily halts witness testimony in cases regarding the failure
of the A.R. Baron brokerage firm, a signal that a grand jury
investigation into the role that Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. played in the
collapse is reaching a critical point.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, applied on
Wednesday for the order, formally a stay, and Justice E.J.
McLaughlin of New York state Supreme Court granted it. The order
expires Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Under the stay, neither the New York Stock Exchange nor the
National Association of Securities Dealers may take or allow
testimony of witnesses in a variety of securities arbitration cases
concerning the 1996 failure of A.R. Baron, whose founders stole $75
million from investors from 1991 to 1996. Calling the firm a
criminal enterprise, Morgenthau's office won convictions of 14 A.R.
Baron employees last year.
</P>
<P>
   The clearing of Baron's customer trades and its back-office
administration were handled by a Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. subsidiary,
Bear Stearns Clearing Corp. As Baron's clearing firm, Bear, Stearns
also guaranteed customers' trades at Baron.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor's stay applies to all arbitration cases involving
Baron, and all that name as respondents Bear, Stearns and Hanifen
Imhoff, another firm that had acted as clearing agent for Baron.
The district attorney could seek to extend the stay on Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Bear, Stearns declined through a spokesman to comment on the
stay.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal and securities lawyers said applying for such an order
was significant. ``When a prosecutor's office seeks a stay in
testimony in related civil matters, it is significant to the extent
that it indicates a serious government prosecution is ongoing,''
said Andrew Levander, a partner at Swidler, Berlin, Shereff and
Friedman in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It also indicates that the district attorney's office has
information that it does not want to share with adversaries, such
as Bear, Stearns. Had the arbitration proceedings not been stayed,
Bear, Stearns would have access to much of the information that
prosecutors have secured in testimony, even perhaps from former
Baron employees who are cooperating with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, court documents filed by John Moscow, an assistant
district attorney, stated that if the cases were not stayed, ``it
would adversely, and seriously, harm the prosecution of future
indictments.'' The documents also say that the grand jury
investigation is continuing into the activities of other people and
organizations involved with Baron and that a determination as to
who, if anyone, should be charged is expected before the end of
October.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow could not be reached to comment further on the stay.
</P>
<P>
   A.R. Baron's collapse shed a spotlight onto the immensely
profitable but secretive business of clearing securities
transactions, a business that Bear, Stearns had dominated. Clearing
firms not only process securities transactions and other paperwork,
but they also provide capital to small brokerage houses, allowing
them to do business on a relatively small deposit.
</P>
<P>
   After Baron's fall, Morgenthau's office and other securities
regulators began to scrutinize clearing firms' roles in
small-capitalization stock fraud at brokerage houses. A.R. Baron,
for example, had had many run-ins with regulators, yet Bear,
Stearns continued to clear its trades.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers close to the investigation into Baron say that
settlement talks between Bear, Stearns and the district attorney's
office have been continuing. That the stay expires at the end of
October may be a signal from prosecutors that any settlement must
be reached by then.

 By CHARLES DOWNEY  
 From Kiwanis magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Jimmy, a 6-year-old first-grader, should have weighed about 50
pounds but pressed the scales to the 95-pound mark. At his school
near Baton Rouge, La., the lumbering lad always was dead last in
gym-class activities and any sports he played with fellow students.
 &HT;    Because of the flabby rolls that hung over his pants, Jimmy
suffered all the cruel taunts other children could heap on a boy
who weighed almost twice the normal weight.
 &HT;    Eventually, his physician referred him to a weight-loss clinic,
the Committed to Kids Pediatric Weight Management Program at
Louisiana State University in New Orleans.
 &HT;    One of his first prescription slips read: ``Play outside twice a
week for 20 minutes.'' This could entail walking, bicycling,
in-line skating or other common childhood pastimes. At first, it
was difficult for him to huff and puff through those 20 minutes,
but he slowly improved.
 &HT;    Like Jimmy, most obese children live in industrialized nations,
but cases of childhood obesity are found worldwide. American kids
top the childhood heavyweight list: One in four children ages 5 to
12 is 70 percent or more over his or her proper weight, according
to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
 &HT;    Childhood obesity is partly caused by children being home alone
after school and snacking on whatever they want, as often as they
want. Also, more and more children have become couch potatoes who
routinely log four to six hours a day watching television or
playing video games.
 &HT;    Medical doctors, nutritionists and child-behavior specialists
are concerned about these trends, because obese children still are
growing and require certain nutrients for healthy physical and
mental development. Such growth may be stunted by high-fat diets
and sedentary lifestyles.
 &HT;    After a year at a weight-loss clinic, Jimmy worked up to doing
aerobic exercises and other physical activities for 45 minutes five
times a week. He _ along with his family _ also learned
much-improved nutritional habits and reduced his weight to 67
pounds.
 &HT;    But the big plus for Jimmy was constantly finishing first in
physical activities and sports at school. The cruel taunts stopped
when he began placing at the top.
 &HT;    Trading television for sports works, and many children need to
try it. The World Health Organization once surveyed Canadian
children and found that, outside school, the girls were active only
half an hour per week or less. One-fourth of the boys and girls
reported spending at least four hours a day in front of the tube.
 &HT;    ``We don't tell our young patients they must give up
television,'' says Uwe Blecker, medical director of the LSA
weight-loss clinic, ``but instead of watching television or playing
video games four hours a day, we ask them to reduce it to three. Or
we ask them to ride a stationary bike or walk on a treadmill while
watching television.''
 &HT;    It's all too easy for children to get their forks into one of
the biggest health hazards: fatty foods. Health professionals who
monitor the eating habits of young children have found that one
cheeseburger with fries can equal the total amount of fat a child
should consume in two days.
 &HT;    Children who must watch their weight are encouraged to consume
more whole grains, vegetables and fruits while cutting back on _
not eliminating _ dairy products, beef, pork, lamb and high-fat or
highly sugared treats.
 &HT;    Obesity has a genetic link. According to Canada's National
Institute of Nutrition in Ottawa, Ontario, if both parents tip the
scales at a normal weight, the probability of a child becoming
obese is about 10 percent. But if one parent is overweight, the
child's odds of matching that physical trait rise to 49 percent.
 &HT;    If both the mother and father are overweight, a child stands an
80 percent chance of becoming obese, due to a complex mix of
genetic and lifestyle factors that medical scientists don't fully
understand.
 &HT;    What medical science does understand about obesity is the
increased risk of more widespread health woes, such as the
development of diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis or skeletal
problems in hips and legs.
 &HT;    Studies reveal that portly children usually grow into pudgy
teens and adults. Each stage then brings its own woes. For
instance, University surveys and personality inventories show that,
as early as kindergarten, children have an aversion to obesity and
describe their overweight classmates as less likable, less capable
and less able to control themselves.
 &HT;    To curb childhood obesity, the American Pediatric Association
urges families to begin early with proper diets and exercise. When
overweight children learn to reduce and maintain weight through
good nutrition and exercise, the loss is more likely to be
permanent as they grow into young adulthood.
 &HT;    ``One of the primary causes of childhood obesity among our
patients is because families no longer sit down together for dinner
at a fixed time,'' says Baylor College's William Klish. ``Instead,
children eat in front of the television, after `grazing' all
afternoon. But when everybody in a family sits down for dinner at a
fixed time every night, fewer and healthier calories are consumed.
Also, today's children just don't play outside like they did in
years past.''
 &HT;    Families eat less when they eat together, because they talk and
that slows down the speed of eating, giving the stomach's fullness
signals a chance to work. Even small amounts of food will begin
sending satiety signals to the brain after about 20 minutes.
 &HT;    Children tend to lose weight more successfully when the entire
family is involved. Ideal loss for plump children is no more than
one-half to one pound per week.
 &HT;    ``When an overweight child starts watching the types of food he
or she eats, the rest of the family also must watch what they
eat,'' says Marilyn Day, a nutritionist at Children's Hospital in
Denver, Colo. ``It's unfair to forbid cookies and other treats to a
child while others in the home munch them.
 &HT;    ``I've found in my practice that a child often can lose unwanted
pounds through some very simple changes in ordinary foods that are
normally kept in the home,'' she adds. ``I've known children who
cut back from whole milk to skim milk or cut out the highly sugared
cola drinks and lost weight.''
 &HT;    Other researchers have uncovered an unexpected source of flab in
a study group of 168 children ages 2 to 5: fruit juice. In
Pediatrics, the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, they
reported that children who drink at least 12 ounces of fruit juice
a day are more likely to be obese.
 &HT;    Young children worldwide are famous for being fussy eaters. More
than one serving of peas or spinach has ended up on the floor or
caused an evening-long power struggle between parents and children.
Studies have disclosed, however, that if caretakers introduce new
or more nutritious foods to young children too forcefully, it can
backfire.
 &HT;    Susan Johnson, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the
Center for Human Nutrition of the University of Colorado Health
Sciences Center in Denver, found in a study of 77 youngsters ages 3
to 5 that those children with the most body fat also had the most
controlling mothers.
 &HT;    Johnson notes that, though parents still are responsible for
making sure that children eat healthful food, the ``children
themselves are capable of figuring out how much to eat.''
 &HT;    Her advice about clean plates? ``Relax a little.''
 &HT;    The study revealed that children whose mothers allowed them to
be spontaneous about food _ to eat when they are hungry and not
necessarily finish all the food given to them _ showed a natural
instinct for regulating their own calories.
 &HT;    So there may be hope for caregivers trying to make vegetables _
and other unfamiliar but healthful food _ more popular with young
children. After all, if it leads to better health via an
appropriate weight, what harm is there in a few servings of peas
and spinach on the dining-room floor?

 By DIANE HARRIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It figures. Just as American employers finally appear to be
catching on to the need for family-friendly programs and policies,
a small but vocal group comes along that seems bent on taking those
hard-won benefits away.
 &HT;    Call it a backlash, but a growing number of childless workers
are protesting what they believe to be the inequity of benefits
designed to help working parents better balance the demands of
their personal and professional lives.
 &HT;    ``Programs and policies that exclude large groups of people are
inherently unfair,'' says warehouse-software manufacturer Ann
Price, a member of The Childfree Network, a Citrus Heights,
Calif.-based advocacy group that boasts 5,000 members nationwide.
``If I don't have kids, family-friendly benefits by definition
aren't very friendly to me.''
 &HT;    New research supports the notion that some childless workers
feel they are being stiffed by their employer's focus on the needs
of co-workers with kids. For instance, some 56 percent of work-life
professionals believe that childless workers harbor resentment
toward employees with children, according to a recent survey by The
Conference Board, a business-research group in New York.
 &HT;    ``Where people feel the most discrimination is around time _
having to stay late at the office, having to finish work at home,
not being able to attend to personal responsibilities,'' says
Marcia Brumit Kropf, a vice president with Catalyst, a women's
research and consulting firm in New York. ``The real problem is how
stretched everyone feels in the workplace today.''
 &HT;    With a view toward clearing the air, here is a closer look at
the most common complaints voiced by childless workers, along with
some expert thinking about what's legitimate about the gripes,
what's not and what companies and employees can do to insure a fair
deal for all workers, whether they are parents or not.
 &HT;    + It's a family-friendly world out there.
 &HT;    If only it were true.
 &HT;    ``Over the past five years there has been a sea change in
consciousness, a general recognition that helping employees balance
their professional and private lives is an important business
issue,'' Brumit Kropf says. ``But we have a lot of work left to do
to turn that consciousness into reality.''
 &HT;    In fact, while the range of possible benefits has expanded over
the past decade, the majority of employers have yet to get with the
program.
 &HT;    Consider: Only 37 percent of companies offer paid parental
leave, only 18 percent provide any form of child-care help, such as
an on-site child-care center or backup care, and a scant 12 percent
lend a hand with adoption expenses, according to a 1996 survey of
313 companies by Buck Consultants, a New York-based
benefits-consulting firm.
 &HT;    But while family-friendly programs are not as ubiquitous as
critics claim, a climate that is generally open to family concerns
is.
 &HT;    ``Companies tend to reflect a cultural attitude that views
raising children as a kind of sacred calling,'' says Mary Young, a
researcher at Boston University's School of Management. ``Having to
get home to your kids is a high card of sorts that is hard for a
childless employee to match.''
 &HT;    What would help: The most painful work-life conflict for
employees is to not be treated with respect or recognized as a
whole person with a compelling life off the job, concludes a new
study by human-resources consultant Marci Koblenz of MK Consultants
in Evanston, Ill. And that's as true for childless employees as it
is for working parents, Koblenz found.
 &HT;    Yet the language used to describe programs to help employees
achieve balance _ phrases such as ``family-friendly'' or
``work-family'' _ inadvertently fuels divisiveness by seeming to
exclude anyone who doesn't have kids.
 &HT;    To send a more inclusive message, a growing number of firms are
changing the name of their initiatives to more neutral titles, such
as ``work-life,'' indicating that such programs are intended to
help all employees resolve conflicts between their personal and
professional responsibilities, whether or not they have children.
 &HT;    + Childless workers pick up the slack for working moms and dads.
 &HT;    Three quarters of the work-life experts surveyed by The
Conference Board disputed the notion that employees without
children carry more than their fair share of the work load.
 &HT;    ``Sure, you occasionally hear stories about childless employees
staying until 10 at night to make up the work left behind by a
working parent,'' says Catherine Popper, a vice president with WFD,
a work-family research and consulting firm in Boston. ``But those
incidents by far tend to be the exception, not the rule.''
 &HT;    When such a problem does arise, experts say, the cause can
usually be traced to how a flexible schedule was implemented, not
to the policy itself. Most typically, a well-meaning manager may
approve a working parent's request for flextime without thinking
through the consequences.
 &HT;    What would help: Companies need to train managers about how to
implement flexible schedules, work-family experts suggest. Before a
request for flextime is approved, the supervisor and employee
should discuss how the work will be accomplished and establish ways
for the employee to pass along needed information when she's not in
the office.
 &HT;    ``Managers need to treat flexibility as a business issue, a
strategy to achieve business results,'' Popper says, ``not as an
accommodation.''
 &HT;    + Childless workers do not get a fair share of the benefits pie.
 &HT;    ``An on-site child-care center or a lactation room are icons of
all the money that companies spend on employees with kids,'' says
Ann Price of The Childfree Network. ``For childless workers,
they're a constant reminder of all the benefits dollars that aren't
spent on us.''
 &HT;    Price is not alone in her views: Some 42 percent of the work-
family specialists in The Conference Board survey agreed that
employees without children feel they are subsidizing benefits for
other employees' families lives.
 &HT;    To some extent, the negative feelings simply reflect bad PR on
the part of employers. Companies don't usually talk up benefits
that are used primarily by workers without children, such as
tuition assistance and wellness programs, even though they are far
more common offerings.
 &HT;    What would help: As a first step, work-life consultants urge
companies to conduct focus groups and surveys to determine which
benefits childless employees value most.
 &HT;    ``Simply by asking, you communicate respect, which can head off
a lot of resentment,'' says Boston University's Mary Young.
 &HT;    A small but growing number of companies are designing
cafeteria-style benefits packages that can be used in different
ways by different employees, depending on their particular needs.
 &HT;    Xerox's 5-year-old LifeCycle Assistance Program is a striking
example: Employees are entitled to $10,000 over the course of their
career with the company, to be used for one of three purposes: to
help pay for child care, a down payment on a first home or
unreimbursed health-care expenses for members of one's household.
 &HT;    + Working parents feel they have a superior claim on the need to
balance work and outside interests.
 &HT;    At its most fundamental level, the tension between working
parents and childless employees boils down to a competition for
scarce resources. In this case, the resource is flexibility, which
the majority of employees want and most companies are loath to
grant across the board.
 &HT;    Do working parents have a greater claim on flexibility than
other staffers? The question is hotly debated among employees,
within the human-resources field and the larger community as well.
 &HT;    Certainly, once a company approves flextime for some employees,
it's difficult for anyone to know where to draw the line and on
what grounds. Is your sick child more important than my sick cat?
Is your need to leave on time to pick up your toddler from child
care more compelling than my need to get to a night-school class so
I can earn an MBA? Is your child's softball game more important
than my softball game?
 &HT;    What would help: Fortunately, if a flextime program is managed
correctly, employers don't really have to get into the messy
business of determining the moral merits of each request.
 &HT;    Amoco makes flextime and a compressed workweek available to all
employees, regardless of family status. Indeed, roughly 10,000
Amoco workers, or about a third of the work force, have opted for
the compressed workweek since the program was introduced
company-wide a year ago _ and the number of enrollees with and
without children is proportionate to their numbers in the work
force.
 &HT;    Certainly, the technology now exists to make such flexibility
possible, from voice mail and faxes to computers, beepers and
e-mail.
 &HT;    As Fran Rodgers, founder and CEO of WFD, observes, ``We're in
the midst of a revolution in the way work gets done.''
 &HT;    But the revolution hasn't been won yet. And until it is,
companies, working parents and childless employees must work
together to create the kind of workplace community in which
everyone is considerate of one another's needs, regardless of
family status.

DISPUTE OVER QUESTIONING DELAYS MICROSOFT ANTITRUST TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sm) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge Thursday pushed back the starting
date of the antitrust trial against Microsoft Corp. by two weeks,
to Sept. 26, while lawyers for the company and the Justice
Department bickered over where and how pretrial questioning of Bill
Gates, Microsoft's chairman, would take place.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a lawyer representing several news
organizations, including The New York Times, asked for an expedited
review of an appeals court order on Wednesday that the deposition
of Gates be taken behind closed doors. Wednesday's order stayed a
ruling by the trial judge in the case that under federal antitrust
law, depositions had to be taken publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The matter is still very much in doubt,'' said Lee Levine, the
news media lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is hearing the
government's case against Microsoft in U.S. District Court here,
reluctantly ruled that a federal antitrust law left him no
alternative but to open the depositions to the news media and the
public.
</P>
<P>
   That stalled the pretrial preparations, particularly the taking
of depositions from Gates and 16 other Microsoft executives,
leading both the government and the software maker to request a
two-week delay in the start of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Because the appeals court had stayed his ruling until the court
could consider how an antitrust law enacted in 1913 applied to
depositions in this case, Jackson agreed Thursday to delay the
trial and ordered the two sides to resume taking depositions as
soon as possible. A Microsoft lawyer, John Warden, told him, ``We
have offered Gates for tomorrow, but the offer was respectfully
declined.''
</P>
<P>
   David Boies, a Justice Department lawyer, responded that
Microsoft had told him that Gates would not be available ``until
next week sometime, but, strangely, after the Court of Appeals
decision, he suddenly became available for tomorrow morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Warden jumped up to rebut that assertion, but Jackson held up
his hands and declared, ``I don't care.'' Then the Justice
Department said it was willing to question Gates this weekend _ but
here, not in Seattle. A Microsoft spokesman said the company had
not made up its mind whether Gates would agree to travel to
Washington to be questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Because this dispute seemed likely to bring a further delay in
the Gates deposition, Levine said he might ask the appeals court to
speed up its review of the open-deposition issue so that the
questioning of Gates might be opened to the news media after all.
</P>
<P>
   In the order issued on Wednesday, a three-judge panel of the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia also scheduled a
hearing on the question of whether the depositions should be
public. But it set the hearing for a date in September well after
all the depositions will have been taken. The appeals court said
videotapes of the depositions could be made public at that point,
if the court so ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Levine said Thursday his clients might ask the Supreme Court to
intervene or might ask the appeals court ``to expedite its
hearings.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, Jay Brown, another lawyer in Levine's office,
said the news organizations had decided to ask the appeals court to
hold its hearing and to make a decision before the trial, so that
videotapes of the depositions could be available to reporters and
others before the trial began.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to The New York Times, the news organizations
involved in the case are The Seattle Times; the cable television
and online news units of Ziff-Davis, a computer trade publisher
owned by Softbank Corp.; and two news services, Reuters and
Bloomberg News.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The most cherished axiom of U.S. diplomacy is that
politics stops at the water's edge, meaning that political
opponents support the president when missiles are flying. Thursday,
it mostly worked, but the challenge of President Clinton's latest
crisis crystallized when some critics uncharacteristically cried
foul.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of Republican congressional leaders, from House Speaker
Newt Gingrich to such frequent Clinton adversaries as Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., rallied around the commander-in-chief, with Gingrich
declaring: ``I think, based on what I know, that it was the right
thing to do at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the surreal and cinematic atmosphere that suffused
official Washington all week, some voices that would usually be
reliably hawkish suddenly sounded just plain shrill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger here is that once a president loses credibility
with the Congress, as this president has through months of lies and
deceit and manipulations and deceptions, stonewalling, it raises
into doubt everything he does and everything he says, and maybe
even everything he doesn't do and doesn't say,'' said Sen. Dan
Coats, R-Ind., who less than 72 hours earlier had called for
Clinton's resignation over the Monica Lewinsky issue.
</P>
<P>
   Coats added, ``I just hope and pray the decision that was made
was made on the basis of sound judgment and made for the right
reasons, and not made because it was necessary to save the
president's job.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., was only slightly softer in
questioning Clinton's air strikes in Afghanistan and the Sudan,
insisting: ``I'm not going to suggest ulterior motives,'' but
adding, ``I especially want to know the reason for doing it now. I
want to know what the evidence was.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the city, there was an inescapable sense Thursday that
the timing of the raid might have been dictated by politics rather
than intelligence information. Among the questions that Defense
Secretary William Cohen faced at the official Pentagon briefing on
the air strikes was whether he had seen ``Wag the Dog,'' the
satirical film in which a president concocts a war to deflect
attention from a sexual encounter with a teen-age girl. He did not
bother to answer, instead insisting, ``The only motivation driving
this action today was our absolute obligation to protect the
American people from terrorist activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., said, ``I think that's pure
malarkey,'' when he was asked about any connection between the
cruise-missile strikes and Clinton's political and legal problems.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that such questions came up at all was seen as an example
of the damage the Lewinsky matter has done to Clinton's overall
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing people think about is `Why did the president
do this; is it to divert attention from other problems that have
been plaguing the White House?''' asked Rep. Rod Gramms, R-Minn.
``That just shows how much damage has been done to the institution
of the presidency.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even many of those who voiced support of the president reflected
the toll of the Lewinsky matter, taking pains to discount any link
without being asked. ``I know some are suggesting this was a
decision made for other reasons, because of the Monica Lewinsky
investigation,'' Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., told reporters
without prompting. ``To those people I have one thing to say:
Either put up or shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   More typical was Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah _ who had dismissed
Clinton's Monday speech on the Lewinsky matter by saying, ``What a
jerk!''_ said Thursday, ``Now I want to applaud the president. I
want to give him credit for being willing to take this action at
this time. Some people have been critical. The fact is, I doubt
that he would have taken this action without an awful lot of
intelligence backup.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholars who have studied the links between past presidents'
foreign policy actions and public opinion found none of that
surprising Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never discovered any kind of factors that negate these
things from happening,'' said Larry Hugick, director of media and
political surveys at Princeton Survey Research Associates in
Princeton, N.J., who has studied presidential approval ratings in
foreign policy crises from Harry Truman to George Bush. ``In a
legitimate crisis where a president is using military force and
it's widely known to the public here, there's a tendency for his
approval rating to rise, and I would expect it would here.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Bardes, a professor of political science at the
University of Cincinnati, agreed that presidential performance
ratings have risen for everything from Ronald Reagan's 1986 air
strikes on Libya in retaliation for the bombing of a West Berlin
night club, to his invasion of Grenada, to Bush's invasion of
Panama and his handling of the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is how do you prove success in an atmosphere in
which there is some suspicion of the administration's
forthrightness,'' Professor Bardes said. ``That makes this a
riskier proposition than those other moves. There was an underlying
confidence in the Gulf war that the smart bombs went down the
chimney, and then later we found out it wasn't quite that good. But
now we're in a very funny time period, a very tenuous
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugick noted that even failures, like John F. Kennedy's
disastrous invasion of the Bay of Pigs in 1961, or Jimmy Carter's
failed rescue mission for the Iranian hostages in 1980, have caused
temporary rises in approval ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his administration, Clinton's policies have often
been driven by polling, though his aides have always been loath to
ascribe any political motives to his foreign policy moves. But when
Clinton finally intervened in Bosnia, after temporizing for his two
years in office, his aides acknowledged that the president began to
appreciate the unilateral power he had over foreign policy even as
a Republican Congress stymied many of his domestic plans, and he
had always hoped that foreign policy would play a more prominent
role in his second term.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., urged Clinton on.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration for the last seven months has neglected
compelling national security threats besides this _ Saddam
Hussein's ejection of our inspectors, North Korea building nuclear
weapons again in violation of an agreement, Middle East peace
process stalled, thousands of people being ethnically cleaned in
Kosovo,'' McCain said. ``I hope that the president will not confine
his activities to just this, but to address the other very
compelling problems that also affect our nation's security problems
long-term.''

   WASHINGTON _ Africa's largest country is also one of its most
troubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sudan is buffeted by civil war, chronic political instability,
adverse weather, high inflation, a drop in remittances from
(Sudanese living) abroad and counter-productive economic
policies,'' the Central Intelligence Agency reported in 1996. Two
years later, that evaluation still stands.
</P>
<P>
   Hunger is widespread, especially among the Christians and
animists in southern Sudan, a tropical area controlled by a shaky
coalition of anti-government forces who call themselves the
National Democratic Alliance. The northern region, containing the
capital city of Khartoum and most of the Islamic population, is a
flat, sandy area that this month was devastated by floods.
</P>
<P>
   Sporadic negotiations have failed to end the 15-year civil war,
in which 1.5 million have died from fighting or famine.
</P>
<P>
   The long-simmering war has complicated relief efforts by Save
the Children and World Vision Sudan Relief, which last month alone
collected more than a half-million dollars from Americans to help
Sudanese. One German group is thinking of avoiding road blocks by
dropping packages of food out of low-flying cargo planes.
</P>
<P>
   The United States placed Sudan on its list of
terrorist-harboring countries in 1993, and protested further by
moving its embassy operations to neighboring Kenya in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``America incarnates the devil for Muslims,'' according to
Hassan Turabi, an Islamic leader who appears to be the power behind
the transition government's president, Omar Hassan el-Bashir. The
lengthy ``transition'' grows out of a military coup in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The government's policy of waiving visa rules for any visiting
Muslim has made the country a special favorite for people in
political or criminal trouble in their home countries. One of them
was Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born millionaire who has endorsed
terrorist causes, and lived in Sudan before he moved to
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Some facts to keep in mind about Sudan:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Neighbors: In northeast Africa, across the Red Sea from Saudi
Arabia, Sudan has porous borders. East are Eritrea and Ethiopia;
South are Kenya and Uganda; West are the Congo, the Central African
Republic, Chad and Libya; and to the North is Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Size: At roughly 2.5 million square kilometers, Sudan is
one-fourth the size of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Population: Like California, Sudan has about 33 million
residents.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ethnic groups: Black 52 percent, Arab 39 percent, and Beja 6
percent, plus 3 percent foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Languages: Arabic is the official language. But many African
languages and dialects are spoken, and the former British colony
still has many English speakers.

the transition government's president, Omar Hassan el-Bashir. The
lengthy ``transition'' grows out of a military coup in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The government's policy of waiving visa rules for any visiting
Muslim has made the country a special favorite for people in
political or criminal trouble in their home countries. One of them
was Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born millionaire who has endorsed
terrorist causes, and lived in Sudan before he moved to
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Some facts to keep in mind about Sudan:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Neighbors: In northeast Africa, across the Red Sea from Saudi
Arabia, Sudan has porous borders. East are Eritrea and Ethiopia;
South are Kenya and Uganda; West are the Congo, the Central African
Republic, Chad and Libya; and to the North is Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Size: At roughly 2.5 million square kilometers, Sudan is
one-fourth the size of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Population: Like California, Sudan has about 33 million
residents.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ethnic groups: Black 52 percent, Arab 39 percent, and Beja 6
percent, plus 3 percent foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Languages: Arabic is the official language. But many African
languages and dialects are spoken, and the former British colony
still has many English speakers.

<TEXT>
<P>
   After a week of what felt like nonstop talk about sex, ties and
audiotape involving President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky,
television screens were overtaken Thursday by news of a different
shock value.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton announced, just before 2 p.m. ET, that
the United States had bombed what he described as terrorist bases
in Afghanistan and the Sudan, television news networks shifted into
full-tilt coverage of a more conventional kind _ interviewing
experts in terrorism, military affairs and politics; showing video
of the still-burning building in Khartoum, and carrying the
president's formal address to the nation at 5:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lewinsky matter was melded into the bombing coverage
almost immediately because of the similarity between reality and
the recent movie ``Wag the Dog,'' in which a fictional American
president fabricated a war to divert attention from reports that he
had propositioned a young girl in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkable coincidence, reporters killing time in a press
tent near the president's vacation site in Martha's Vineyard,
Mass., were watching a videotape of that movie when they were
summoned for Clinton's initial announcement, television reporters
told viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The major broadcast networks _ ABC, CBS and NBC _ broke into
their afternoon soap operas within a minute of each other to carry
the president's remarks (CBS was first at 1:45 p.m.), while the
all-news cable networks CNN, MSNBC and Fox News Channel began their
coverage at about the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Wag the Dog'' analogy was almost an obsession during the
afternoon's coverage. In Washington, two Republican senators,
Daniel Coats and Arlen Specter, quickly questioned whether the
real-life president was also trying to divert attention from his
admission on Monday that he had lied about his sexual relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   On CNN Jeff Greenfield called Coats' remarks ``an extraordinary
break with tradition'' and a ``sign of the cynicism'' of our times.
</P>
<P>
   Others, from House Speaker Newt Gingrich to Sens. John McCain
and Orrin Hatch to the Rev. Jesse Jackson, appeared on the various
networks to denounce Coats' implication and to urge support of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Fox News' White House correspondent, Jim Angle, said it would be
difficult, ``even if you don't believe the president,'' to believe
that the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other advisers would be involved
in timing such a grave military operation just to assist Clinton's
personal agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Snow, the Fox Anchor, replied that if ``foreign policy
professionals'' thought that had happened, ``you and I and other
reporters would have gotten phone calls by now.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN had the most dramatic footage of the afternoon, when it
relayed not only the video of the rubble-strewn burning building in
Khartoum, but the audio of a speech being made by the Sudanese
minister of information (with simultaneous English translation),
denouncing the attack on what the minister called a pharmaceutical
company, and describing Clinton as a man with ``more than 100
girlfriends'' and ``a proven liar.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's appearance before the grand jury Thursday, which
otherwise would have been prominent news, was relegated to brief
reports near the end of the three broadcast-network evenings news
programs.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, the television images of Clinton had again become
presidential, as he was seen interrupting his vacation, striding
onto Air Force One to return to the White House, and then
addressing the nation in the mode of commander in chief, against a
full-dress backdrop of the American and presidential flags. It was
a sharp contrast to his dreary demeanor and the somber setting of
Monday's confessional appearance.

FLEMMI IDENTIFIES FBI AGENT WHO WARNED BULGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ On the witness stand in federal court Thursday,
gangster-turned-informant Stephen Flemmi explained for the first
time Thursday how his longtime criminal sidekick James ``Whitey''
Bulger was able to leave town before the law came calling: he was
tipped off by FBI supervisor John Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Answering the question that has lingered since last summer _
when Flemmi first claimed in an affidavit that someone in the FBI
gave him and Bulger a head start _ Flemmi laid the blame for at the
feet of Morris, a now-retired agent who earlier this year admitted
taking payoffs from the criminal partners.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly four hours, the career criminal whose double life
exposed the shadowy world where lawmen and outlaws collude
described three decades of being alerted to investigations and
indictments _ the price, he claimed, for helping the FBI bring down
the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be protected and we would not be prosecuted for
anything we did on their behalf, at their behest,'' said Flemmi,
who was unmasked as an informant last spring, shortly before he
dragged the murky methods of the FBI into the glare of the
courtroom to try and get charges against him dropped.
</P>
<P>
   As the crowning defense witness in months-long hearings, Flemmi
hopes to convince federal judge Mark L. Wolf to drop extortion and
racketeering charges brought against him, Bulger and the local
Mafia hierachy in 1995 because of the deal they had with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   In April, testifying under immunity, Morris denied he warned
Bulger and Flemmi about the January 1995 indictments. But he
confessed to taking $7,000 in payoffs from the criminal pair,
admitted he warned Flemmi to avoid a bookmaker under investigation,
and helped Bulger and Flemmmi dodge indictments for fixing horse
races.
</P>
<P>
   But Flemmi said Morris, who retired from the FBI at the end of
1995, was not the only bureau agent or supervisor looking out for
him. Among Flemmi's claims Thursday:
</P>
<P>
   _ Former FBI organized crime supervisor James Ring, &UR;  &LR; Morris'
successor, phoned Flemmi at his mother's house in December 1984 to
let Flemmi know his phone and that of his associate, George
Kaufman, were going to be tapped as part of an investigation by the
US Drug Enforcement Administration and Quincy police. The
investigation collapsed four months later after Bulger found a bug
in his car.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ring, according to Flemmi, told Bulger in October 1986 that
Boston police Lt. James Cox &UR;  &LR; who was cooperating with the FBI in a
probe of police corruption was ``wired'' _ a warning for Bulger to
stay away.
</P>
<P>
   -- Former FBI agent H. Paul Rico phoned Flemmi early one morning
in September 1969 and told him he was about to be indicted for
blowing up the car of a Boston attorney, Flemmi said, ``and
suggested that me and my friend leave immediately.'' After four
years on the lam, Flemmi said, Rico convinced him to return to
Boston. A federal fugitive warrant for him was withdrawn, Flemmi
said, through the efforts of a former FBI handler, Dennis Condon.
</P>
<P>
   -- Former agent John Connolly, Flemmi's longtime handler,
confirmed to him that he and Bulger were targets in a South Boston
drug investigation in 1988 and 1989. Connolly also allegedly shared
the identity of other informants with Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   -- Bulger learned about a listening device planted in a garage
near North Station where they conducted criminal business from
Connolly, who Flemmi said conveyed the message from Jeremiah O'
Sullivan, then the head of the New England Organized Crime Strike
Force. Flemmi said he also learned about the bug from now-deceased
State Trooper John Naimovich, who was acquitted in June 1989 of
leaking confidential information to an informant.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by phone Thursday, Ring, who testified for 10 days
earlier this summer, had no comment on Flemmi's testimony. He said
the ``appropriate, professional response'' was to say nothing since
Wolf had not yet ruled in the case.
</P>
<P>
   But Flemmi's allegations, both revived and new, brought a swift
and united response from US Attorney Donald K. Stern and Barry W.
Mawn, the special agent in charge of the Boston office of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Stern and Mawn had requested an investigation into Flemmi's
claims by the Justice Department and the FBI when they first
surfaced last summer. That report has never been made public.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a federal prosecutor from Connecticut has been named
to investigate whether present or past FBI officials engaged in
criminal misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Stern continued to insist that the actions of rogue agents did
not provide Flemmi or his co-defendants with a valid legal basis
for challenging the charges brought against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a court were to bar such a prosecution, it would be saying
that such a deal, if it was made, was one which the law should
recognize,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very frustrating,'' said Mawn, who took over the
Boston office of the FBI two years ago. ``It does anger us
somewhat'' because ``this is activity that's gone on in the past
... coloring all the good the Boston FBI has done for the last 20,
30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi, who traded in the black and white jogging suit that he
wears to court on most days for a herringbone sport jacket, white
shirt and tie, corroborated much of what Morris and others
testified to earlier this year: the cozy dinner parties, the
exchange of Christmas gifts.
</P>
<P>
   But he contradicted some testimony. Flemmi said Morris's bribe
was only $5,000, but he failed to mention an extra $1,000 Morris
said was hidden at the bottom of a case of wine and another $1,000
given to him to fly his girlfriend to an out-of-state conference.
</P>
<P>
   And he maintained that Morris had told him and Bulger they could
``do anything as long as you don't clip anyone.'' Morris denied
making that statement.
</P>
<P>
   After Morris made that remark, Flemmi testified, ``I asked if we
could shake hands. We shook hands and Jim Bulger shook his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   But Flemmi denied that former Massachusetts Senate President
William Bulger, Whitey Bulger's brother, had wandered into a dinner
meeting that his brother and Flemmi were having with their FBI
handlers.

   Continuing its recovery, Novell Inc. reported earnings Thursday
that modestly exceeded Wall Street estimates.
</P>
<P>
   For its third quarter, which ended on July 31, Novell reported
earnings of $26.6 million, or 7 cents a share fully diluted, in
contrast to a loss of $121.6 million in the corresponding period a
year earlier. At $272 million, sales were more than three times the
$90.1 million reported in the third quarter of the 1997 fiscal
year. Sales in the 1997 quarter were depressed by a one-time
inventory reduction carried out at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expected Novell to earn 6 cents a share, according to
First Call. Novell reported its results after the close of the
market. In Nasdaq trading, Novell shares closed unchanged at
$10.875.
</P>
<P>
   Novell said its third-quarter 1998 results included $30 million
in operating profit, up from $16 million in the second quarter.
``We've clearly stabilized the business,'' Eric Schmidt, Novell's
chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.``We're beginning
to grow, it's just not clear how fast we're growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said the company's performance in the third quarter was
the more surprising because it did not include Version 5 of its
flagship Netware network operating system software, which is
scheduled to ship by the end of summer. ``We have to get to an
impressive Internet product, which we will do with Netware 5.0,''
he said.

<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ The air strike against a drug factory in Sudan
on Thursday marked the first act of open warfare in a
long-simmering cold war between the United States and the Islamic
regime in Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has been at odds with the governing National Islamic
Front in Sudan almost from the moment it seized power in a 1989
coup and set up a theocratic state ruled along conservative Islamic
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past nine years, the United States has repeatedly
accused the Khartoum regime not only of supporting Islamic
revolutionaries in neighboring countries but also of harboring
various Arab terrorists who hate America and Israel, among them
leaders of the Palestinian group Hamas, the Cairo-based Islamic
Jihad and the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important of these figures is Osama bin Laden,
the Saudi businessman whom U.S. investigators maintain was behind
the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, who is believed to finance a network of Islamic
terrorists around the world, lived for several years in the Sudan
and still owns several major businesses there, including a
construction firm and company that exports gum arabic.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech justifying the air strikes Thursday, President
Clinton said the drug factory U.S. missiles destroyed about 12
miles north of the Sudanese capital was ``associated with the bin
Laden network.'' He said the plant was manufacturing chemicals used
in nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Afghanistan and the Sudan have been warned for years to stop
harboring and supporting these terrorist groups,'' Clinton said.
``But countries that persistently host terrorists have no right to
be safe havens.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, bin Laden was forced to leave the Sudan in 1996 after
western intelligence organizations said he was linked to an
assassination attempt against Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. The
United States stepped up political pressure on the Sudan,
threatening to cut off diplomatic ties if bin Laden was not
expelled. He migrated to Afghanistan, where the Talieban militia
have allowed him to set up several training camps for terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Osama bin Laden has left the Sudan for over two years and he
has nothing to do with Sudan,'' Sudanese Interior Minister
Abdel-Raheem Hussein told the BBC on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Still, U.S. officials say bin Laden has maintained close ties
with senior members of the Khartoum government, many of whom share
his aggressively anti-American views. He continues to finance
terrorist groups within the Sudan, these officials say.
</P>
<P>
   In May, bin Laden issued a call for a religious war against the
U.S. and promised a campaign of terror.
</P>
<P>
   But bin Laden is not the only bone of contention between the
United States and the Sudanese.
</P>
<P>
   Khartoum has long charged that Washington supports the rebellion
in the mostly Christian and animist south of the country that has
cost more than 1 million people their lives and has led to three
famines in the last decade, the latest this year in Bar el Ghazal.
</P>
<P>
   The southern rebels have been struggling against Khartoum for 15
years, but their movement has been crippled by tribal divisions and
factional infighting. They maintain they are fighting for more
autonomy for southern states, a secular government and religious
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration denies it supports the rebels
directly, but it acknowledges giving non-lethal military aid to
Uganda, Eritrea and Ethiopia, who have in turn have funneled arms,
radios and other equipment to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have also made it plain the U.S. supports the
rebellion's goals. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright even took
the bold step of meeting with the main rebel leader, John Garang,
last December during a visit to Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the leaders of the Sudanese government, however,
blame the U.S. for the continuing war, which has sapped the economy
and demoralized northerners. Many in Khartoum see the rebellion as
part of a U.S. strategy to destabilize Sudan and eventually force
the government to fall.
</P>
<P>
   The endless war also serves U.S. goals in the Middle East. It
weakens Khartoum's ability to support Islamic militants opposed to
the government in Egypt, the most important U.S. ally in the Arab
world and a counterbalance to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, Sudan's political elites have taken pains to
show the world they have turned over a new leaf since the early
days of their coup, when they openly professed a desire to spread
Islam to other countries.
</P>
<P>
   A new constitution has been adopted this year guaranteeing the
freedom of religion and association, opening the door a return to
party politics, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, they maintain they have tightened immigration rules
to keep out terrorists and expelled many known Islamic militants,
including bin Laden himself. They also point out they have reached
peace agreements with all the major rebel leaders except Garang's
and are in negotiations with him.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. diplomats have dismissed many of these reforms as
cosmetic. U.S. intelligence officials say Sudan continues to
provide a haven to terrorist organizations and the National Islamic
Front's leaders still have an iron grip on power.
</P>
<P>
   As rescue workers struggled Thursday night to ferry wounded
workers to hospitals and to put out the fire at the Al-Shifa drug
factory, Sudanese officials portrayed themselves as the victims of
naked aggression.
</P>
<P>
   Information Minister Ghazi Salah-Eddin said the plant had been
opened two years ago and produced nothing but medicines. ``This is
a crime,'' he said. ``There is no justification for this attack.''
</P>
<P>
   But Salah-Eddin said the attack was predictable, given the
recent history of the two countries. In a sense, he suggested, the
simmering conflict between the United States and the Khartoum
government had finally come out into the open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to remind people that this is a very old battle
between right and wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway across the world, President Clinton appeared on national
television to voice a similarly bellicose sentiment, painting the
air strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan in black and white terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a long ongoing struggle between freedom and
fanaticism,'' he said. ``Between the rule of law and terrorism.''

<P>
   In the war against terrorism, experience suggests that any
operation, whether an assassination or the sort of strike launched
by the United States Thursday, has the quality of
damned-if-you-do-and-damned-if-you-don't.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, according to experts _ especially in
Israel, where the fight against terrorism has been waged longest
and hardest _ is the possibility that the strike on Thursday
destroyed training sites and a chemical-weapons plant, and a few
terrorists as well.
</P>
<P>
   If American intelligence did in fact pinpoint sites used by the
people behind the bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, the attack will also put terrorists on notice that they
can never rest or let their guard fall.
</P>
<P>
   On the down side is the fact that such attacks have not shown
much effectiveness as deterrents. On the contrary, experts say, it
is most likely that the targets of the action and their supporters
will lash back.
</P>
<P>
   And given the growing sophistication of militant groups in the
use of media, it is likely that television cameras will be invited
to record any civilian victims or wayward bombs, with the United
States portrayed as a heartless bully, and President Clinton as a
scandal-wounded leader in search of sensational diversion.
</P>
<P>
   But among Israelis, at least, after coping with terror for most
of their history, the consensus is that Clinton did what he had to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all boils down to punishment, deterrence and prevention,''
said Joseph Alpher, the head of the Jerusalem office of the
American Jewish Committee and an expert on military affairs. ``Even
if it's revenge, it's meant to send a message that there will be a
retaliation, and that is deterrence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the Israeli experience or the American
experience, a deterrent message doesn't always work. Israeli
operations have not necessarily deterred terrorism, and they often
become part of a cycle of strikes and counterstrikes. But it does
make it more difficult for terrorists to act.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you don't retaliate, you appear to be weak, not
interested in deterring _ an easy target. So the only answer is
prevention. You kill terrorists, force them to duck, to keep their
heads low, to worry about being discovered by American
intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   If that was the goal, one question is whether an air strike was
the most effective method. Roger Clark, a professor of
international law at Rutgers University, said the primary goal in
the battle against terrorism should be to catch terrorists, ``and
I'm not persuaded that bombing is the way to go about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. and Israel are the prime supporters of the notion of
retaliation in the world,'' he said, ``and they tend to make legal
justifications that other people are uncomfortable with. I'm not
convinced that punishment is useful as a deterrent. You have to try
to catch some of the terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Herman, professor emeritus at the Wharton School of the
University of Pennsylvania, also found the strikes problematic. ``I
don't think these are very effective,'' he said. ``It's very hard
to bomb accurately. It is a violation of international law; there
are United Nations rules. So when a country just chooses to drop
bombs on two separate countries, they may kill people who are
innocent bystanders, and it's likely to be counterproductive.''
</P>
<P>
   Yossi Melman, an Israeli writer specializing in intelligence
issues, said that the American raids on Thursday might be viewed as
a daring operation politically, but that questions were bound to
arise about the timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Americans hadn't acted, they'd say Clinton was paralyzed by
the affair,'' he said. ``If he does, they say he's using this to
divert attention. But he has to show that America is still a
superpower, and doesn't tolerate actions against its installations
and interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Melman said it was too early to assess operational aspects of
the raids. But he expected that those would be ``more problematic
and doubtful,'' in part because Osama bin Laden, the Saudi Arabian
exile the United States believes to be behind the bombings in Kenya
and Tanzania, remains alive, according to officials in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with combatting terror, the experts agreed, is that
success or failure cannot be measured in traditional military or
law-enforcement terms. Ultimately, they said, the targets of terror
must strike back, if only to demonstrate that they have not been
cowed or demoralized.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview several months ago, Ehud Sprinzak, a professor
at Hebrew University, in Jerusalem, noted that Israelis have always
supported strikes against terrorists, even if they knew the
retaliation might be even greater.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you consider that terrorism is largely a psychological
weapon, psychology is very important in the fight against terror,''
he said. ``Sometimes you have to boost the morale of your own
people.''

 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the stock market struggles to get back on its
feet, investors are focused on corporate earnings, buoyed by
reports that profits among the biggest companies are still rising,
albeit slowly.
</P>
<P>
   But a gauge of corporate profits produced by the government
paints a darker picture.
</P>
<P>
   As measured in the National Income and Product Accounts,
corporate earnings declined in the fourth quarter of last year and
in the first quarter of 1998. And next week, when the Commerce
Department releases that report for the second quarter, analysts
expect a decline in corporate earnings for the third consecutive
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   There have been six declines of at least three consecutive
quarters since 1960. And five of those times, the Dow Jones
industrial average fell at least 15 percent from its peak ahead of
that profit decline.
</P>
<P>
   In those five stock spills, the average Dow drop was 23.4
percent. The average earnings decline of three quarters or more was
11.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   From the Dow's recent peak through last Friday, the index had
dropped nearly 10 percent, and it remains down about 8 percent from
its high. If, as expected, corporate earnings fell 4 to 5 percent
in the second quarter, the total decline will be about 10 percent
over the last nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, history is not a good predictor of financial markets.
But a look at these corporate data _ which many stock analysts
dismiss as inadequate _ may indicate a weaker earnings environment
than described by Wall Street, an upbeat place anticipating more
profit growth in the second half of this year. And it may help
explain why so many stocks, especially small ones, have fallen
sharply. According to Merrill Lynch, 74 percent of all stocks had
fallen 20 percent or more from their 1997-1998 highs as the Dow
neared its recent low.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the differences, start with Wall Street's most
common measure of corporate profits, the earnings from continuing
operations of the 500 companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's index.
Using this Wall Street measuring stick, profits rose 8.2 percent in
the fourth quarter of 1997 from their level a year earlier, 1.2
percent in the first quarter of this year, and 3.4 percent in the
second quarter, based on nearly final data.
</P>
<P>
   The National Income and Product Accounts, gleaned from income
tax and other government data, show changes from quarter to quarter
instead of from year to year. The data form the basis for official
government reports on economic growth, including the gross domestic
product, personal income and several broad measures of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   They also provide an official tally of corporate profits from
thousands of companies, filling in a gap left by the S&AMP;P 500, which
accounts for about three-quarters of corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, the quarterly government data reflect what companies
report in profits to the Internal Revenue Service. These numbers
are not adjusted for extraordinary items _ like financing of
company pension plans _ that accountants strip out. Nor are they
altered by one-time charges, like restructuring or acquisition
costs, that Wall Street analysts deduct to produce what they call
operating or continuing earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The government data reflect these extraordinary and other costs
as they occur. The S&AMP;P figures, based on quarterly earnings
reports, allow companies to take such costs all at once. Companies
generally prefer to take a one-time hit so earnings growth can
quickly recover.
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, there can be a sharp disparity between the
government profit report and the S&AMP;P 500 report. Just look back to
1991. S&AMP;P 500 operating earnings, after adjustments by Wall Street,
fell 21.8 percent, 24.2 percent and 17.9 percent, respectively, in
the first, second and third quarters, from the periods a year
earlier, according to First Call, an investment research company
that tracks analysts' estimates. The government report showed that
corporate profits rose 4.5 percent, before slipping 1.3 percent and
1.9 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thomas Galvin, the chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin
&AMP; Jenrette, said he did not rely on the government profit report.
Writeoffs are very much accepted today, he said, and investors are
always looking forward. For that reason, they prefer continuing
earnings, which try to reduce the volatility caused by one-time
writeoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Clough, the chief investment strategist at Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co., has a lot of confidence in the government data. ``You
can't manipulate them,'' he said. ``They are earnings you can write
a check with.''
</P>
<P>
   And the current decline in this measure has him worried. Falling
corporate profits are going to put a squeeze on corporate
investment, which has been ``the key to the Goldilocks economy,''
Clough said.
</P>
<P>
   The government report, however, is not a good predictor of stock
market turns. The market is a leading indicator, not a lagging
indicator, of economic activity. In the five times that profits
fell for three quarters and the stock market fell, the market
peaked before profits began to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the report may be an indicator of where Wall Street's
favorite measure is headed. Total corporate profits declined from
the second quarter of 1984 through the first quarter of 1985,
compared quarter to quarter. But the S&AMP;P operating profits,
measured year-over-year, did not turn negative until the fourth
quarter of 1984. In that episode, the Dow peaked on Nov. 29, 1983,
and fell 15.6 percent to a low of 1,086.56 on July 24, 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The government profits measure also fell from the second quarter
of 1969 through the second quarter of 1970. But the adjusted S&AMP;P
measure began to show a decline only in the fourth quarter of 1969.
The Dow, from a peak of 985.21 on Dec. 3, 1968, fell 35.9 percent
to a low of 631.15 on May 26, 1970.
</P>
<P>
   But the profits gauge is not foolproof as an indicator of market
weakness. Total corporate profits _ and S&AMP;P 500 operating profits _
did not fall in the quarters around the 1987 crash. In the 1973-75
downturn, when the Dow fell 45 percent, the government profit
measure fell sharply, but for only two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   And there was one instance, in 1989, when total corporate
profits declined for three consecutive quarters and the Dow
industrials did not truly plunge. The stock market index remained
on an upward course despite a one-day 6.9 percent free fall on Oct.
13.
</P>
<P>
   What did follow was a three-quarter decline in operating
earnings in the S&AMP;P 500, Wall Street's favorite measure.

 &HT;    Braves on deck: San Diego Padres
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ When: 7:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where: Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   _ TV: TBS.
</P>
<P>
   _ Probable starting pitchers: RHP John Smoltz (11-2, 3.32; 11-7,
2.90 lifetime vs. Padres) vs. RHP Joey Hamilton (10-10, 4.58; 2-7,
5.49 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   _ Notes: Hamilton is having a 4-1 second half, and one of the
highlights was his Aug. 11 victory against the Braves. Against a
club he has had trouble handling during his young career, he went
seven innings and gave up six hits and one run. Hamilton survived a
six-game losing streak that lasted through May into June and has
been 7-3 since June 8. His 4.58 ERA, higher than the 3.70 career
rate he opened the season with, has been hurt by the big game. He
has given up five or more earned runs nine times, but in 13 other
starts he gave up two earned runs or less. His hits-to-innings
ratio is high (172 hits in 169 innings), and his 77 walks are
fifth-most in the league. Smoltz, the medical marvel, has gone 7-1
since coming off his second stay on the DL on June 20 and is riding
a six-game winning streak in his last eight starts. He has beaten
the Padres and Hamilton once this year (6-3 on May 7), when he gave
up two runs in the first inning but then drove in three runs with a
double and a single.

 &HT;    The Master of Minor Management
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANVILLE, Va. _ Slowly yet surely, he's mastered the fine art of
managing in the minor leagues. Not that it's been easy to subjugate
winning to the greater good of the organizational flow chart. Even
as a kindergartener, Paul Runge was so competitive, so
temperamental, he insisted on having a Monopoly monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ``My competitive nature started when I was 5 years old,'' said
Runge, who grew up in a New York household of eight kids who loved
the Yankees and revered the Mick. ``We'd sit in the kitchen and
play Monopoly. Once I was eliminated, I'd turn the board upside
down and run out of the kitchen. If I couldn't play, no one else
could.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five years later, at least Boardwalk and Park Place are
safe. ``Even when we play games, if I win we've got to play
again,'' said Runge's wife, Rae Ellen. ``If I find a game I'm
better at than he is, he doesn't want to play it.''
</P>
<P>
   That stubbornness and fierce drive enabled him to last parts of
eight seasons as a utility infielder with the Atlanta Braves. Now
in his sixth season of micro-managing in the lower minors, Runge
can recite the Skipper's Creed: It's not whether you win or lose,
it's how (ITAL)they(END ITAL) play the game that counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always competitive. But over the years, I've learned to
sort through the winning and losing and the player development
going on,'' said Runge, who manages the struggling Danville 97s,
Atlanta's advanced Class A affiliate in the Carolina League. ``The
ideal scenario? Have both going on at the same time. Unfortunately,
the world doesn't always work that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned to differentiate as a manager. You've got to
learn patience and always know in the back of your mind that the
bottom line is (to) see players improve from beginning to end and
prepare them for the next level when you turn them over. We all
play our little part.''
</P>
<P>
   When he first passed through here in 1994 to manage the Danville
Braves of the rookie Appalachian League, Runge got to bench a kid
center fielder for loafing and insubordination long before Bobby
Cox ever disciplined Andruw Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was real fiery when I started managing, a Sgt.
Carter-type,'' Runge said, referring to Gomer Pyle's TV drill
sergeant. ``When you first start, you're real gung-ho. You holler
and scream. I was a sore loser and real fiery, because I wanted
everybody to do well every day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a lot different now,'' said Glenn Williams, an Australian
bonus-baby shortstop when he first played for Runge in '94 and now
a second baseman. ``His fuse was a little bit shorter then.''
</P>
<P>
   It burned to a crisp one night when Runge was ejected for
arguing, returned to the dugout, then flung his cap out on the
field. Dozens of D-Braves fans did likewise on Cap Night. That
summer, Runge went into the stands after the final out to confront
a season-ticket holder who'd been screaming all night about
Danville's lack of aggressiveness on the basepaths.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ``He's almost two different people,'' said Tim Cahill,
general manager of both Atlanta farm clubs playing here this year
and the GM in '94 when Runge managed the D-Braves. ``His biggest
adjustment is being content with playing .500 ball. His biggest
credit is he wants to see his players do well. There's some
managers who just want to win, play .600 ball so they can move to
another level. Then there's others who genuinely want to see
development.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Braves slugger Darrell Evans was fired as manager of
Kansas City's first-place Wilimington farm club in the Carolina
Leauge for ``philosophical differences'' _ winning too much at the
expense of developing prospects. Bill Plummer suffered a similar
fate after winning the first-half title in 1996 while managing
Detroit's Jacksonville Suns affiliate in the Class AA Southern
League.
</P>
<P>
   Runge has avoided that pitfall. Although he's never had a
winning record as a minor-league mananger, he's never lost sight of
the big picture _ the big leagues, the best prospects' destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job basically is to make sure those guys are out there
every day and get a chance to experience a lot of things on a
trial-and-error basis,'' Runge said. ``And also with a lot of
instruction.''
</P>
<P>
   At a lot lower volume, though. ``I found out through my
experiences (that) you don't have to holler and scream to get your
point across,'' Runge said. ``I found out everybody's different.
Some guys need a little pat on the back, some a little nudge.''
</P>
<P>
   Runge can still nudge. After a sloppy late-July home loss after
a long road trip, he gave the 97s a wakeup call. He called a 9 a.m.
practice for the next day. Their first morning-after workout of the
season, purportedly to work on defensive fundamentals, also was a
group lethargy session.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lethargic from travel and the daily grind of the
schedule,'' Runge said. ``But there's no excuse for lackluster
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even with a kinder, gentler, OK, more patient manager.
``He's high intensity,'' said pitcher Rob Bell, a right-handed
starter who is 6-7 but one of Atlanta's top-10 prospects. ``He's a
high-control guy, wants to control everything he can, night-in,
night-out. The guy wants to win. He wants guys to take extra BP, do
everything they can to make it to the major leagues. That's a
reflection on him.''
</P>
<P>
   That's also the bold-faced section of Runge's job prescription.
Some lower-level minor-leaguers, of course, are more equal than
others. Runge must gear his managing toward nurturing the more
talented, and more expensive _ such as Williams, 21, who signed in
1993 for a $925,000 bonus; minor-league managers make between
$25,000 and $60,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is a career .224 hitter, and he's batting less than
that this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every guy gets a chance, but there's going to be some guys who
get more of an opportunity because of the money invested,'' Runge
said. ``The real true prospects in the organization are going to be
in the lineup every day. They won't be pinch-hit for. The starting
pitchers are going to be in the rotation every five days,
regardless of how they're doing. Those guys are going to get their
at-bats and innings (pitched).''
</P>
<P>
   If, say, Bell has a no-hitter going in the seventh inning but
has reached his pitch limit, he's done. ``We know the importance of
a young pitcher and his arm,'' Runge said. ``When a guy has a
chance at a complete game, a shutout, even a no-hitter, it means
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The 97s have no complete games this season; Bell is only starter
to pitch into the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a player like Williams _ once a switch-hitter, now
solely right-handed after a shoulder separation _ is a lineup
fixture. ``He's going to get every opportunity to show what he can
do, regardless of game situations,'' Runge said. ``You can pretty
much throw out stats in the lower minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I pinch-hit for him with the bases loaded and he's been
struggling? No. Even if he'd already struck out four times, that
one at-bat might turn his career around.''
</P>
<P>
   So, damn the competitor within, tough as that may be. Just
develop, baby. ``I'm trying to protect the kids' interests and the
money invested in them,'' Runge said, ``and trying to get them
ready to play for Bobby Cox one day.'' And continue Atlanta's
monopoly on the postseason into the next millenium.

 &HT;    CLINTON RECEIVES BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FROM CONGRESS, SOME GOP
MEMBERS QUESTION TIMING
 &HT;    With USSTRIKES-MAIN-0821.
 &HT;    By REBECCA CARR 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a surprise break with tradition, some senior
congressional Republicans questioned the timing of President
Clinton's decision Thursday to strike at terrorist facilities in
Afghanistan and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   But House Speaker Newt Gingrich strongly defended the move,
saying it delivered a much needed message to terrorists
contemplating future attacks on Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was exactly the right thing to do,'' said Gingrich,
R-Ga., in a telephone interview with the Cox News Service. ``It
says to every country in the world: if you are the host to a
terrorist, you are a target.''
</P>
<P>
   The military strikes, which appeared to have overall bipartisan
support among congressional members, were aimed at ripping a hole
in the heart of the terrorist regime of Osama Bin Laden, a Saudi
multi-millionaire and chief suspect in the recent bombings of U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania -- which killed 257 people and
injured 5,500 others.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans, however, questioned the timing of the
strikes, noting that it came four days after the president stunned
the nation by admitting that he had an ``inappropriate
relationship'' with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky after
denying it for seven months. It also came on the very day that
Lewinsky was to return to the grand jury investigating whether the
president committed perjury or obstructed justice in an attempt to
conceal the affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the president's personal difficulties this week, it is
legitimate to question the timing of this action,'' said Indiana
Republican Daniel Coats, a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee. ``Once the president has broken the bond with the
American people, as he has done with his repeated lies, it raises
questions about everything he does or does not do.''
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania Republican Arlen Specter raised an eyebrow as well.
``I think we have to raise certain concerns and look for evidence
because those questions will be raised around the world. . . . the
president's current problems have to be on the minds of many
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Specter offered support for Clinton's actions, saying he
had more time to evaluate the purpose of the strikes and added that
``the president acted appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   The strike at Bin Laden coinciding with the developments in the
Lewinsky scandal caused some to compare the current climate in
Washington with the plot in the film ``Wag the Dog,'' in which the
president is caught having sex with a young woman and tries to
distract the nation's attention by fabricating a war with Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Those assertions were quickly refuted by the White House. ``The
only motivation driving this action today was our absolute
obligation to protect the American people from terrorist
activities,'' said Secretary of Defense William Cohen, a former
Republican senator from Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The president's troubles should have nothing to do with his
military actions, said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
``Our response appears to be appropriate and just . . . this
Congress will vigorously support the president in full defense of
American's interests throughout the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich agreed: ``Anyone who saw the bombings in Kenya and
Tanzania, anyone who saw the (12 American) coffins come home, would
not ask such a question.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich was briefed about the strikes by the president's
national security advisors on Wednesday. Attempts to reach Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., were also made, but he is traveling
in Europe. However, other key Republicans such as South Carolina
Senator Strom Thurmond, chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee were not notified until just minutes before Clinton told
the media.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add begins.)
</P>
<P>
   And that unleashed a cool response from some members of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not advised of today's operations until shortly before
President Clinton made his public statement regarding the
strikes,'' Thurmond said. ``Such military operations are certainly
risky and it is my sincere hope that there were no injuries or
fatalities among the American personnel involved.''
</P>
<P>
   While he strongly endorses removing terrorists, Georgia
Republican Rep. Bob Barr, said there was ``a mighty big coincidence
in the timing'' of the bombings. Barr, who has pushed for the
impeachment proceeding of Clinton over the Lewinsky affair, added
that he ``hoped the actions taken by the president were taken based
on sound intelligence reports.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, most members of the Georgia congressional delegations
showed support for the president's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation has taken action against very deadly terrorists
opposed to the most basic principles of American freedom,'' said
Georgia Sen. Paul Coverdell, a member of the Foreign Relations
Committee. ``This action should serve as a reminder that no one is
beyond the reach of American justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., urged his Republican colleagues to stop
attacking the president during a time of national crisis. For
Republicans to play politics with national security issues such as
a military strike, ``is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For someone to be questioning the actions of the president, is
playing politics,'' Lewis said. ``We cannot play politics when the
interests and lives of Americans have been threatened. Combative
terrorism is not a partisan issue.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Max Cleland, a Vietnam veteran, said that he strongly
supported Clinton's decision. The bombings should be viewed as
another example of the stern way America will deal with attacks in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrorism is a great threat, not only to the U.S. but also to
the peace and security of the entire world,'' he said.

CLINTON'S TV PERFORMANCES THIS WEEK A STUDY IN CONTRASTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Monday, a somber, resolute and slightly torqued private man
spoke from the dimly lit Map Room of the White House. On Thursday,
a somber, resolute and very decisive president spoke from the
klieg-washed Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's necktie: act-of-contrition blue. Thursday's:
in-your-face red and gold.
</P>
<P>
   Packaging sells.
</P>
<P>
   But if television is just radio with pictures, the words must
still be important, right?
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and his wordsmiths think so. Consider the
first person's use of the first person.
</P>
<P>
   Careful writers are always aware of it. Too much of the first
person singular makes the user seem self-absorbed, inward-looking.
Liberal use of the first person plural, on the other hand, is
extremely disarming and collegial. (Ever notice how news anchors
almost never use ``I,'' even during the mindless chitchat
segments?)
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's unprecedented mea culpa to the masses, the president
wanted us to focus on him, and him alone. He spoke for about four
minutes and used the words ``me,'' ``my,'' ``myself'' and ``I'' 46
times _ a staggering pace of once every five seconds. There was no
mistaking the intensely personal nature of those remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, in his afternoon address to the nation to discuss the
strikes against terrorist targets, Clinton spoke twice as long but
made only 15 such personal references. Just enough to be
presidential, as in: ``I want to speak with you'' and ``I decided
America must act.''
</P>
<P>
   In high contrast, the president used the all-inclusive ``we''
and ``our'' 52 times, a brisk six or seven per minute. ``We have
high confidence,'' the president said. ``We must take extraordinary
steps.'' ``We will not yield to this threat.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he was a lonely figure caught in a lie. (And if he
had stopped before taking aim at Ken Starr, he might have elicited
more sympathy.)
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he was one of us again. The captain of the team.
The go-to guy at crunch time.
</P>
<P>
   If asked to vote on the matter, actors will always say an
effective performance begins with the writing. In the president's
case, you could see it in his ``I's.''

 &HT;    Development, not winning, key in minors
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Winning definitely isn't everything in the minor leagues.
Developing players for the majors is the priority, with team
won-loss records often an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   That was never more obvious than in 1996, when Baseball America
magazine named the Atlanta Braves the organization of the year
despite a composite minor-league winning percentage that ranked
28th among 30 major-league franchises.
</P>
<P>
   Other systems had the wins, but they didn't have players like
Andruw Jones _ minor-league player of the year two seasons in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' farm system _ also voted No. 1 in 1991 _ has kept a
steady flow of young players coming to the majors despite having
only three winning records this decade and none since 1993. This
year, Atlanta's composite winning percentage of .430 is the worst,
just behind Los Angeles. No Braves farm team has a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here for only one reason _ to get players ready for the
big leagues,'' said Deric Ladnier, Atlanta's director of minor
league operations. ``Winning is nice, but it's not our emphasis. We
are very careful with our young pitchers, and we don't sign a bunch
of career minor-leaguers to fill out rosters.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Atlanta owns all but two of its farm teams, the Braves
also don't have to worry about complaints from owners trying to
fill seats with a winning team.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' only team likely to make the postseason is Class A
Macon. The M-Braves were 30-40 in the first half, but are 32-28 in
the second and lead the South Atlantic League's Southern Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are one of the youngest teams in the league and struggled
at first,'' Macon manager Brian Snitker said. ``But some of our
players have grown up, and we are playing much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Atlanta concentrates on drafting and signing high school
players, Braves' farm teams are usually younger than their
opponents. Teams with most of their players from college have a big
edge in the lower minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we think players taken out of high school have more
potential,'' said Paul Snyder, the Braves' director of scouting and
player development. ``They can learn the game our way.''

 &HT;    WNBA more successful marketing than playing
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even when they lose _ and the Washington Mystics
have set a new low-water mark for futility in professional
basketball _ the WNBA expansion franchise is still a winner.
</P>
<P>
   After a 110-65 loss Monday to the defending champion Houston
Comets, an MCI Center crowd of 15,758 warmly applauded the Mystics,
even after they were on the short end of league records for most
points surrendered in a game and margin of defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has gone through a coaching change, and wholesale
personnel moves are expected for a team that finished 3-27 with a
.100 winning percentage, poorer even than the woeful 1972-73
Philadelphia 76ers, whose .110 figure on a 9-73 record, has been
the Mendoza line of pro hoops for the last 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate this, but it's great that our fans have loved us all
along and keep coming out no matter what,'' said Mystics guard
Nikki McCray, a former Tennessee All-American who was the first MVP
of the rival American Basketball League.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most symbolic of the WNBA at the end of its second
summer is that its worst team has its best attendance mark. The
Mystics averaged 15,898 fans in 15 home games, well above the WNBA
average of 10,729, and have attracted three of the five top
single-game crowds in league history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at all these people,'' Houston coach Van Chancellor said
during a timeout with the score 87-44. ``There ain't nobody going
for dinner, ain't nobody going for nachos. They're staying to watch
a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, many were waiting for the last free pair of Nikes to
be thrown into the crowd and an incredibly loud playing of ``YMCA''
to blast forth from the sound system.
</P>
<P>
   Which prompts a question: Is this a rock concert or a basketball
game?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the entertainment business,'' said Chancellor, the
folksy former Ole Miss coach who admits that he doesn't listen to
the ``modern music'' that constitutes a WNBA game atmosphere.
``It's more than a basketball game. It's a happening.''
</P>
<P>
   League attendance is up 11 percent from last season, and the
WNBA's marketing and merchandising prowess continues. With exposure
on three networks and a summer season away from the cluttered fall
and winter sports docket, the 10-team WNBA has made more strides
toward its goal of becoming what commissioner Val Ackerman calls
the ``fifth major league.''
</P>
<P>
   But only Houston has been dominating on the court. The Comets,
who romped to a 27-3 regular season record, play Saturday afternoon
at Charlotte in the first of a best-of-three semifinal series. In
the other matchup, Cleveland plays Saturday night at Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The Mystics undertook a large direct-marketing effort to tap
into a fan base that identifies with female athletes and looks for
affordable entertainment options. Mystics, Wizards and Capitals
president Susan O'Malley talked up ``Girl Power'' to appeal to
young females, and families happily have scooped up $8 tickets.
There is never a quiet moment during games, with giveaways, dancing
and music blaring in a whirlwind of a relentlessly hip pop-culture
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a lot of fun,'' Mystics spokeswoman Julie Demeo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're a player on a team with expectations of winning.
Reigning MVP Cynthia Cooper of Houston is feeling some effects of a
concussion sustained two weeks ago. And Comets point guard Kim
Perrot might miss the playoffs with a badly sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure is on us to prove that our record is
legitimate,'' Cooper, 35, said. ``We like the position we're in.
We're ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor is wary of two close calls against Charlotte this
season and that Cleveland and Phoenix have dealt Houston two of its
three losses: ``In a short series, anything can happen to
anybody,'' he said. ``Anybody can win this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston's ``Big Three'' _ Cooper, Sheryl Swoopes and forward
Tina Thompson _ provides the only postseason star quality, with New
York and Los Angeles, featured more prominently on television, both
out of the playoffs. ``If we have a Chicago Bulls in the WNBA right
now, it is certainly in Houston,'' Ackerman said this week. ``In
some respects, they are our glamour team.''
</P>
<P>
   Other matters behind the scenes are vexing for the league. On
Thursday, the NBA Players Association accused WNBA management of
delaying an election by players on the question of unionizing. The
average league salary is $35,000, with only a handful making the
maximum of $80,000 and earning endorsements and related income.

 &HT;    Wallace confident coming to Bristol
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Va. _ Every time Rusty Wallace comes to Bristol Motor
Speedway, he has good reason to sing its praises.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace sat on the pole the last two races, led a ton of laps,
won one race and had another in his pocket until he ran over debris
and hit the wall.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, he spent more time talking about Jeff Gordon's
4-0 streak than his own 0-50 streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what everybody wants to hear, and I understand that,''
Wallace said. ``I promise you that streak will tame down at one
point, because this stuff goes in cycles.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon makes a run at ``modern-era'' NASCAR history Saturday
night in the Goody's 500, when he tries for his fifth consecutive
victory. NASCAR started its modern era in 1972, when R.J. Reynolds
signed on as sponsor and NASCAR trimmed its Winston Cup schedule to
30 races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four wins is a lot of wins, but when you're in a zone
everything starts clicking,'' Wallace said. ``It all comes to an
end, but you got to ride it all you can, because everybody's up.
And when you go to the track, you feel like you can't be beat. I'm
sure that's the feeling he's got right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace should know a little of how it feels. He hasn't won four
straight, but he won 10 times in 1993 and 16 races 1994-97.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a zone during that period, where every time I went to
the track I felt like I was going to win,'' Wallace said. ``What
happens is, you go to these tracks and look around at other guys,
and you know they can't beat you. And that feeling gets stronger
and stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace would like to feel it again during today's qualifying
and Saturday's race. Bristol is the type of track that should give
Wallace confidence; he has been racing here since 1986, when he won
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the fact that Bristol is where I first won gives me a
fondness for the place,'' Wallace said. ``But it's more that that.
I love that area of the country. The fans are some of the best
around. This is a track that every time I come here, I expect to
win, expect to run up front all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace was doing just that in March. After winning the pole,
his fourth at Bristol, he dominated the race, leading on six
occasions for 220 of the first 397 laps. Then trouble hit. He ran
over debris from Ricky Rudd's car, punctured a tire, slammed into
the wall and eventually finished 33rd.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the race everybody wants to talk about,'' Wallace said.
``We had that in our grasp before we ran over something. You can
say we definitely have some unfinished business to take care of
Saturday night.''

 &HT;      REPUBLICANS SAY WAR ON TERRORISM IS JUST BEGINNING; 
 &HT;      DISPUTE ``WAG-THE-DOG'' ANALOGY
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Ronald F. Eckstein  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, August 20 -- The American war on terrorism is just
beginning, according to Congressional Republican leaders, and
despite distinct similarities between the Thursday's bombing of
suspected terrorist bases and a recent Hollywood movie, leading
Republicans defended President Clinton's motives and actions.
</P>
<P>
   On a conference call to update Republican congressmen about U.S.
military action in Afghanistan and Sudan, House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Porter
J. Goss, R-Fla., said they were briefed and consulted about ``every
level of detail'' for the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was approached by the Clinton administration (about
retaliatory action) on the day of the bombings in Africa,''
Gingrich said. ``I have been briefed on every level of detail. I
felt, at all times, that I had input.''
</P>
<P>
   Goss added that the administration ``has been very faithful in
keeping us appraised'' since the attacks on the American embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania last week.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said he is ``very comfortable with the planning'' that
went into the American retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was driven entirely by national security considerations,''
Gingrich said firmly. ``If you saw the television coverage of the
embassy bombings, if you saw the caskets coming home, you know this
is real. ... There should be no question by anyone that this is
being exploited in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a very dirty, very nasty little war on
terrorism ongoing for some time, but it is clear it has
escalated,'' Goss said. ``We are having a war and people need to be
behind it and support the president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a long campaign -- six months, two years, three
years -- and there will be casualties,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   Goss said public officials must stress the ``nature of
ugliness'' of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't care about suicide. They don't care about the
targets they take. They would prefer to attack softer targets like
women and children because it is easier,'' Goss warned. ``We need
to remind the American people that this will be ongoing.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republican Conference Chairman John A. Boehner, R-Ohio,
organized and hosted the briefing. Gingrich estimated that more
than 100 Republicans listened in.

 &HT;    Loyalty pays off big for Culpepper, UCF
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO _ Everything Mike Kruczek ever needed to know about
Daunte Culpepper, he learned in Culpepper's first college game.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1995 and on Culpepper's first play as Central
Florida's quarterback, he was sacked by Eastern Kentucky. Culpepper
got up, dusted himself off and proceeded to drive the team 84 yards
for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   On the drive, he completed five passes in a row, checked off to
another play four times and capped the march with a 24-yard scoring
pass. Culpepper would go on to complete his first 12 passes and 20
of 25 in a 40-32 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just raised my arms and thanked God,'' said Kruczek, the
former Steelers quarterback and now head coach at UCF. ``I knew we
had something very, very special.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything Nebraska's Tom Osborne needed to know about Culpepper
took place in one unforgettable half last September in Lincoln.
Central Florida was a 42-point underdog but on the game's first
possession, Culpepper drove the Knights 69 yards for a touchdown.
Culpepper ended the drive with a 10-yard scoring run in which he
bowled over two Cornhusker defenders.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, Culpepper had completed 12 of 17 passes for 186
yards, and UCF led 17-14. The score sent shock waves through
football stadiums across the land.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska came back and won 38-24, but against a team that would
finish 13-0 and share the national championship, Culpepper
completed 24 of 35 passes for 316 yards and a TD. He ran for 34
yards and another score.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may not know about Culpepper now,'' Osborne said
afterwards, ``but the whole world will find out about him, because
he'll be making big noise on Sundays.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything the fans of Central Florida needed to know about
Daunte Culpepper they learned earlier this year when he decided to
pass on pro ball and return for his senior year. If Culpepper had
left school, he probably would have become an instant millionaire,
like fellow quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper's bandwagon already was pretty full with grateful fans
and excited NFL scouts. Now it is overflowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt like this program needed me right now more than
the NFL,'' said Culpepper, who threw for 3,086 yards and 25
touchdowns last season. ``If I take care of business this season,
the money will still be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loyalty,'' he added, ``Is a pretty big thing with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper knows that loyalty is one of the cornerstones for a
successful life. He knows because Miss Emma taught him.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 29, 1977, Emma Culpepper was confronted by a desperate
teenager who had given birth just the day before. She had no means
of support and begged Emma, a worker in a halfway house for
troubled teens, to adopt her baby. Emma was 50 years old and
already had raised 15 children _ some belonging to relatives,
others she had adopted on her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I had the energy to raise one more,'' she said.
But Emma Culpepper agreed to take the baby boy.
</P>
<P>
   That baby was Daunte.
</P>
<P>
   Emma Culpepper, said Daunte, took him in and taught him right
from wrong. She was loyal to him in good times and bad. And there
was plenty of both. He wanted to take the NFL's money and buy her a
new house. She said no. Stay and get your degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is the person who instilled in me the right way to do
things,'' said Culpepper, who at 235 pounds and 6-foot-5, now
towers over Emma. ``If God blesses me and I stay healthy, I will do
anything for her.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was loyalty that brought Culpepper to UCF when the
South's more established football powers came calling.
</P>
<P>
   As a junior at Vanguard High in Ocala, it appeared Culpepper did
not have the right academic stuff to play Division I football. Once
they took a look at his transcript, almost all of the major
football schools backed away.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Lounsberry, the offensive line coach at Central
Florida, stuck around and helped Culpepper put together an academic
plan for his senior year. He would retake some courses and for the
first time, work hard in every one. It paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody thought I could make it, but (Lounsberry) did,'' said
Culpepper, who earned all A's and B's as a senior and met the
NCAA's entry requirements. ``He told me if I could just discipline
myself, I could do it. Nobody else believed in me like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, all the schools that had backed off recruiting
Culpepper suddenly reappeared. They told him that if he went to
Central Florida, he would never reap the glory that he deserved. He
would never play on national television. He would never get the
proper attention from the NFL scouts.
</P>
<P>
   But Culpepper, Florida's Mr. Football as a senior, stood firm.
UCF had stuck by him. He would stick by them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never regretted my decision for one minute,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Culpepper and a memorable 1997 season, UCF's football
program has received a huge dose of national exposure. Not only did
the Knights play toe to toe with Nebraska, they also threw some
major scares into Ole Miss (a 24-23 OT loss), South Carolina (a
33-31 loss), and Mississippi State (a 35-28 loss).
</P>
<P>
   Because of what happened last season, Culpepper's exploits will
make the weekly highlight shows. He'll get some Heisman
recognition, particularly if UCF can win a big game, such as
against Purdue on ESPN on Sept. 19. But even Culpepper concedes his
Heisman candidacy is a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Heisman is really not a big thing on my list right now,''
Culpepper said. ``... I'm more concerned about this team having a
good season.''
</P>
<P>
   With 10 offensive starters returning and an easier schedule, a
winning season is possible. If that happens, his star power might
be strong enough to get the Knights an at-large bowl bid. It would
be, he said, the best farewell present he could give the school
that gave him so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my goal,'' Culpepper said. ``If I can help this team
get to a bowl, it will have all been worth it.''
</P>

 &HT;    QB Leaf trying to revamp bad image
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. _ Maybe it was because June Jones was within
earshot. Perhaps he was feeling pretty good about himself after
shredding a secondary during a seven-on-seven drill.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe Ryan Leaf already is tired of being portrayed as the
spoiled-rotten brat of this year's NFL rookie class.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the rationale behind his sudden flirtation with
civility, a sweaty Leaf was trying hard recently to straighten his
lopsided halo.
</P>
<P>
   His replies were cliche-ridden but polite and measured. What he
lacked in introspection, Leaf compensated for with patience. And on
cue, he lauded the work of a rebuilt offensive line and even his
suspect receivers.
</P>
<P>
   As a teammate cooled his heels, waiting to ferry Leaf to a
nearby watering hole, the punky quarterback, whose talent is
matched only by his attitude, tried to turn on the charm. ``Lots of
this stuff that's being said is just an absolute crock,'' Leaf
concluded before heading for a hot shower and then a frosted mug.
``Just because I'm a little bit of a free spirit and don't toe the
line on everything, ... that shouldn't make you a bad guy. People
who don't know me, some who haven't even met me, are making these
judgments, and it isn't really fair. Some of these accusations,
like that I'm self-absorbed or an enigma ... Geez, I don't even
know what those things mean. I know I'm no choir boy, but ... ``
</P>
<P>
   Many of Leaf's new teammates and coaches contend the bad-boy
image is false. Yet in a six-month reign of terror that doesn't
begin to account for some of his college escapades at Washington
State, the Chargers' first-round draft choice seemingly has managed
to tick off about half the league.
</P>
<P>
   Regarded by some of his college teammates as petulant,
egotistical, overbearing and arrogant _ ``There were guys in his
own huddle who flat-out hated him,'' said former Philadelphia scout
Steve Crosby, now an assistant coach at Vanderbilt _ Leaf already
is threatening rookie records for boorish behavior. At the combine
sessions in February, he infuriated Indianapolis Colts general
manager Bill Polian and coach Jim Mora by blowing off a scheduled
interview and compounded the situation by failing to leave them a
message.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two months ago, Leaf was fined $10,000 by the league for
departing a day early from the mandatory rookie symposium in
suburban Denver.
</P>
<P>
   _ While participating in the made-for-TV ``NFL Quarterback
Challenge'' this spring, he tried to put the moves on an attractive
spectator. The lovely lady, it turned out, was the wife of
Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Neil O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   _ Several training-camp practices have included spats with
Chargers linebacker Junior Seau, who has his own ego and still is
acknowledged as the team's spiritual leader and a person not to
mess with. After last Tuesday's practice, Leaf yelled across the
locker room, ``Hi, buddy,'' to Seau as the linebacker undressed.
Seau, his voice dripping with sarcasm, replied: ``Yeah, hi,
buddy,'' and then quickly ducked into the shower.
</P>
<P>
   _ Leaf maintains that his friendship with Peyton Manning, begun
last fall when the former Tennessee star telephoned him, remains
solid. But he chafes at the suggestion that the Colts rookie is
better prepared to handle the cerebral end of the game. In an
interview last week with the Los Angeles Times, Leaf derisively
referred to Manning as ``The Golden Boy'' and ``Perfect Peyton.''
The two will square off for the first time Saturday night in a
preseason game so hyped it's now hyperbole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he's got an evil twin running around or something,
huh?'' Chargers center Roman Fortin said. ``Really, I think the
guy's been great to deal with. He throws the hell out of the ball.
and if he keeps doing that, his image won't matter very much.''
</P>
<P>
   If Chargers owner Alex Spanos thought that image is everything,
he wouldn't have paid an $11.25 million signing bonus for Leaf, who
once gave the finger to a crowd that jeered him during a
high-school basketball game. If he remains more flippant than
forthcoming, it might be excused if he continues to throw the ball
as well as he did in a camp practice against the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   On consecutive attempts, he completed 12-yard slants, one to
Charlie Jones, a pass delivered so hard that 49ers safety Merton
Hanks was frozen. He connected with Bryan Still on a deep inside
hook, the pass leaving Leaf's hand even before the wide receiver
throttled down in the intermediate zone. He then lofted a deep ball
up the left sideline, just over the fingers of San Francisco corner
Marquez Pope and into the outstretched hands of speedy Tyrone
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   One personnel director from an NFC team just whistled and shook
his head in admiration. A scout from an AFC West franchise said
that Arizona Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill, even with the
charismatic Jake Plummer at quarterback, could rue the day he
swapped the rights to Leaf to the Chargers. After the workout,
several 49ers defensive backs stopped by to shake Leaf's hand.
``Every pass,'' Pope said, ``was right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he has played down his impressive preseason
performance, Leaf is far more comfortable discussing his passing
than his personality. And his coaches now turn the conversation
away from his arrogance and more toward his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is there: strength, release, touch. He's pretty
rare,'' June Jones said. The former Atlanta Falcons coach is
serving as Leaf's tutor, guardian angel and probation officer. Leaf
conceded that he doesn't plan on being just mediocre in the NFL.
Noting that he was ``hardly surprised'' that Gilbride installed him
as the starter so early, Leaf said the Chargers might have the
savior the franchise so desperately needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cutting through all the (nonsense),'' he said, ``I think I'm
going to be something else.''

 &HT;    CLINTON RECEIVES BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FROM CONGRESS, SOME GOP
MEMBERS QUESTION TIMING
 &HT;    With USSTRIKES-MAIN-0821.
 &HT;    By REBECCA CARR 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a surprise break with tradition, some senior
congressional Republicans questioned the timing of President
Clinton's decision Thursday to strike at terrorist facilities in
Afghanistan and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   But House Speaker Newt Gingrich strongly defended the move,
saying it delivered a much needed message to terrorists
contemplating future attacks on Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was exactly the right thing to do,'' said Gingrich,
R-Ga., in a telephone interview with the Cox News Service. ``It
says to every country in the world: if you are the host to a
terrorist, you are a target.''
</P>
<P>
   The military strikes, which appeared to have overall bipartisan
support among congressional members, were aimed at ripping a hole
in the heart of the terrorist regime of Osama Bin Laden, a Saudi
multi-millionaire and chief suspect in the recent bombings of U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania -- which killed 257 people and
injured 5,500 others.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans, however, questioned the timing of the
strikes, noting that it came four days after the president stunned
the nation by admitting that he had an ``inappropriate
relationship'' with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky after
denying it for seven months. It also came on the very day that
Lewinsky was to return to the grand jury investigating whether the
president committed perjury or obstructed justice in an attempt to
conceal the affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the president's personal difficulties this week, it is
legitimate to question the timing of this action,'' said Indiana
Republican Daniel Coats, a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee. ``Once the president has broken the bond with the
American people, as he has done with his repeated lies, it raises
questions about everything he does or does not do.''
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania Republican Arlen Specter raised an eyebrow as well.
``I think we have to raise certain concerns and look for evidence
because those questions will be raised around the world. . . . the
president's current problems have to be on the minds of many
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Specter offered support for Clinton's actions, saying he
had more time to evaluate the purpose of the strikes and added that
``the president acted appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   The strike at Bin Laden coinciding with the developments in the
Lewinsky scandal caused some to compare the current climate in
Washington with the plot in the film ``Wag the Dog,'' in which the
president is caught having sex with a young woman and tries to
distract the nation's attention by fabricating a war with Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Those assertions were quickly refuted by the White House. ``The
only motivation driving this action today was our absolute
obligation to protect the American people from terrorist
activities,'' said Secretary of Defense William Cohen, a former
Republican senator from Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The president's troubles should have nothing to do with his
military actions, said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
``Our response appears to be appropriate and just . . . this
Congress will vigorously support the president in full defense of
American's interests throughout the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich agreed: ``Anyone who saw the bombings in Kenya and
Tanzania, anyone who saw the (12 American) coffins come home, would
not ask such a question.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich was briefed about the strikes by the president's
national security advisors on Wednesday. Attempts to reach Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., were also made, but he is traveling
in Europe. However, other key Republicans such as South Carolina
Senator Strom Thurmond, chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee were not notified until just minutes before Clinton told
the media.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add begins.)
</P>
<P>
   And that unleashed a cool response from some members of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not advised of today's operations until shortly before
President Clinton made his public statement regarding the
strikes,'' Thurmond said. ``Such military operations are certainly
risky and it is my sincere hope that there were no injuries or
fatalities among the American personnel involved.''
</P>
<P>
   While he strongly endorses removing terrorists, Georgia
Republican Rep. Bob Barr, said there was ``a mighty big coincidence
in the timing'' of the bombings. Barr, who has pushed for the
impeachment proceeding of Clinton over the Lewinsky affair, added
that he ``hoped the actions taken by the president were taken based
on sound intelligence reports.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, most members of the Georgia congressional delegations
showed support for the president's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation has taken action against very deadly terrorists
opposed to the most basic principles of American freedom,'' said
Georgia Sen. Paul Coverdell, a member of the Foreign Relations
Committee. ``This action should serve as a reminder that no one is
beyond the reach of American justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., urged his Republican colleagues to stop
attacking the president during a time of national crisis. For
Republicans to play politics with national security issues such as
a military strike, ``is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For someone to be questioning the actions of the president, is
playing politics,'' Lewis said. ``We cannot play politics when the
interests and lives of Americans have been threatened. Combative
terrorism is not a partisan issue.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Max Cleland, a Vietnam veteran, said that he strongly
supported Clinton's decision. The bombings should be viewed as
another example of the stern way America will deal with attacks in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrorism is a great threat, not only to the U.S. but also to
the peace and security of the entire world,'' he said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States attacked targets in Afghanistan
and the Sudan with roughly 70 cruise missiles fired from Navy ships
in the Arabian and Red Seas timed to strike their targets
simultaneously, senior administration and military officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The missiles struck at precisely 1:30 p.m. ET, after dark
settled over their targets, themselves more than 2,500 miles apart,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority struck six separate targets within a sprawling
camp near Khowst, Afghanistan, that President Clinton called ``one
of the most active terrorist bases in the world.'' A smaller
barrage struck a pharmaceutical plant in the Sudanese capital,
Khartoum, that the administration maintained produced important
components for making chemical weapons, particularly VX nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   As the attack began, Secretary of Defense William Cohen ordered
every American military base in the world to heighten its state of
alert, increasing security in the event of retaliation from
supporters of Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi exile whom the United
States accuses of sponsoring terrorism, including this month's
embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   There were no American casualties, the officials said. They said
it was not immediately clear how much damage the strikes caused in
Afghanistan and the Sudan, nor whether there were casualties on the
ground. Reports from Sudanese television in Khartoum said there
were injuries there.
</P>
<P>
   A senior military officer was told less than an hour after the
attacks that the cruise missiles had struck the factory in
Khartoum. The Sudanese television images showed heavy damage, smoke
and fire at the factory, which is in an industrial area northeast
of the city center.
</P>
<P>
   Military and intelligence officials said the extent of the
damage in Afghanistan would not be clear until Friday at the
earliest, but that the targets there included an array of buildings
clearly visible in satellite photographs shown at the Pentagon
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry
Shelton of the Army, declined to discuss details of the strikes, as
did Clinton's other senior national security advisers. But Cohen
said the raids would ``reduce the ability of these terrorist
organizations to train and equip their misguided followers or to
acquire weapons of mass destruction for their use in campaigns of
terror.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, senior officials later said the United States
timed the attack when it did because of ``credible evidence'' that
there would be more than the usual number of terrorists at the
camps in Afghanistan. At the same time, Cohen and other officials
said the attack was launched at night to minimize casualties among
civilians, especially in Khartoum. Cruise missiles launched at sea
posed much less of a risk to American forces than an attack by
warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan was to attack these sites with sufficient power to
certainly disrupt them and hopefully destroy them,'' Cohen said.
``Some of these are solid structures; others are less so, but we
believe that given the targeting that was done with the capability
that was unleashed, it would cause sufficient damage to disrupt
them for some time.''

HBO'S `RAT PACK' CAN'T GET UNDER THE SKIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They researched the facts and worked on the characterizations,
but the makers of ``The Rat Pack'' ultimately lose their way.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. and their cronies,
in real life, formed the Rat Pack for the joy of it.
</P>
<P>
   They were rodents, but (set ital)fun(end ital) rodents.
</P>
<P>
   If the cosmos was one big cocktail lounge in the early 1960s,
then life in it was a perfect martini. Shaken (set ital)and(end
ital) stirred.
</P>
<P>
   The HBO movie, showing Saturday, takes an occasionally spirited
stab at reconstituting the old fizz.
</P>
<P>
   Its art direction and sort of cuckoo-crazy musical interludes
are right on the verge of getting it, rather like a slick retro bar
that serves up highballs and jiggers of attitude.
</P>
<P>
   But breezy, boozy fun is not a natural quality in the 1990s. We
can't even fake it convincingly.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra (Ray Liotta) pins Martin (Joe Mantegna) on the phone and
says, ``Listen, Dean, I got it all planned out. We take the plane,
we catch Sammy's show. We'll grab some ring-a-ding, and we'll take
the chopper to the Springs for a midmorning clambake, and I'll have
you back to the Oasis by show time. It'll be a gas.''
</P>
<P>
   And it would be a gas _ for them, back then. Today it would be
bogged down by worrisome business calls on the boys' cell phones,
fear of the diseases that go along with the ring-a-ding and calorie
counting at the clambake, whatever a Rat Pack clambake may have
been.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, you can't have a productive business meeting with a
hangover. And if you live in a time when time is money, you have a
hard time imagining a time when time was merely time.
</P>
<P>
   So the ``Rat Pack'' actors can only pretend to have fun; the
real thing is probably the stuff of cultural archaeology.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, director Rob Cohen and screenwriter Kario Salem see
their film as a tragedy. Of course.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Rat Pack, the Kennedys and the Mafia again, with the
usual side dish of Marilyn Monroe (Barbara Niven).
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra provides Jack Kennedy (William Petersen) his women.
Kennedy provides the giddy Sinatra with a bit of presidential
panache. The Kennedys and the mob communicate through the Rat Pack.
</P>
<P>
   All of this makes Kennedy in-law and ex officio Rat Packer Peter
Lawford (Angus Macfadyen) miserable. He comes across as a spineless
errand boy who's deathly afraid of all his patrons.
</P>
<P>
   (Sinatra to Lawford: ``Don't squirm, Peter. I hate it when you
squirm.'')
</P>
<P>
   Dean Martin is the sensible cynic here, careful not to run afoul
of anyone. Joey Bishop (Bobby Slayton) is mainly a nonpresence. And
Don Cheadle, a rising star who is cast as Sammy Davis Jr., just
about sneaks off with the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Davis is configured as the most tragic rat of all,
unless you count Sinatra finally getting jilted by the Kennedy
clan.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tears-of-the-clown turn. Davis patiently endures
Sinatra's stage antics, which reduce Davis to little-black-mascot
status. Also, his interracial love affair and eventual marriage to
the Swedish actress May Britt brings him heaps of unwanted
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The oddest scene in the film is a fantasy sequence in which
Davis dances and sings ``I've Got You Under My Skin'' to a mob of
brown-shirted demonstrators outside his hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   Cheadle projects Davis onto the street and does the number in
front of a big neon ``N_'' sign, adorned with Stars of David. It's
audacious _ way out there. It's also foolish in a rather
spectacular way. Cheadle manages to recoup his character's dignity,
but the scene leaves a lingering (set ital)huh?(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The central character of Sinatra, as opposed to the real
Sinatra, is a tough read in this movie. Salem's script probably
does the right thing in violently mixing Sinatra's conflicting
traits _ insecurity, an explosive temper, generosity, vanity,
arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   But whoever Frank Sinatra was, he was not Ray Liotta. The
baby-faced Liotta has said he could handle the role because ``I'm
from Jersey, I got blue eyes. It's close enough.'' It isn't close
enough. He's all wrong physically, and he doesn't have a whisker of
Sinatra's ratty charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are all the voices. There's a fake voice subbing for
The Voice in ``The Rat Pack.'' The Sinatra family didn't confer its
authorization on this movie, and Sinatra's voice is never heard in
it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, dealing with three well-known singers, the movie tries
to get by with swinging instrumentals, several lip-synched voice
imitators and, here and there, actual vocalizations by Mantegna and
Cheadle.
</P>
<P>
   If Martin had been Mantegna, Dino would have been fino long
before 1960. And Cheadle can't wheedle an authentic note from his
throat.

`NEW' TERRORISM AMORPHOUS, PRIVATELY FUNDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The terrorist bombings in east Africa -- and the swift US
military response to them Thursday -- dramatically represent a new
era of world terrorism and the challenges faced by the US faces in
fighting it.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists say terrorist groups in recent years have mutated
into amorphous, trans-national entities which target the United
States through private funding sources centered around a single
belief: righteous killing in the name of God.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case marks major changes in direction of terrorism, an
increasing willingness to inflict mass casualties without claim of
responsibility from a trans-national group, aimed at expelling the
West rather than drawing attention to a specific cause,'' says
Jerrold Post, the former head of the CIA's center for analysis of
personality and political behavior in terrorism, and the author of
the 1997 book ``Political Paranoia: the Psychopolitics of
Terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of their lack of organizational structure and intense
religious zeal, these new groups are willing to attempt massive and
indiscriminate acts of terror -- unlike their more traditional and
more organized predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amid the confusion of vague claims and uncertain leads,
multiple possible suspects and a web of tangled motives, one aspect
of the tragic events in East Africa seems clear: A new era of
terrorism has begun, with a potential to be both bloodier and more
destructive than any experienced before,'' according to Bruce
Hoffman, author of the book ``Inside Terrorism'' and director of
the Center for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence at St.
Andrew University, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Scott, a retired special operations commander in the US
Army responsible for terrorism response throughout the 1980s, says,
``What has changed in ten years is a change from politically
motivated terrorism to religiously motivated terrorism. And these
groups are emerging out of failed states, such as Sudan and
Afghanistan, which are attracting largely trans-national, adhoc
terrorist groupings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The old form of political terrorism was perhaps deterrable,''
he adds. ``What we are finding now is that the new religious
terrorism may not be.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, terrorism was practiced by members of identifiable
organizations with ``a defined command-and-control
</P>
<P>
   apparatus,'' according to an analysis of modern terrorism
published this week in the Los Angeles Times by Hoffman, regarded
as one of the world's leading experts on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   These groups included the Japanese Red Army, the Red Army
Faction in Germany, the Red Brigades in Italy, as well as
ethno-nationalist terrorist movements like the Palestine Liberation
Organization, the Irish Republican Army and the Basque separatist
group, ETA.
</P>
<P>
   These organizations had more defined objectives, he writes. They
generally issued communiques taking credit for, and often
explaining in detail, their actions. They engaged in ``highly
selective and mostly discriminate acts of violence,'' Hoffman
explains, choosing traditional targets such as embassies, banks,
and national airline carriers that symbolized their hated foes.
They kidnapped and assassinated persons whom they blamed for
economic exploitation or political repression to attract attention
to themselves and their causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were somewhat more rational goals, if we can use that
word, to describe terrorism,'' adds Richard Shultz, director of
internaional securities studies program at the Fletcher School of
Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, who has studied the changing
face of terrorism through the twentieth century.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we see today in this case and others is a larger
ideological context of Islam against the West. Terrorism is
becoming more religious, and the goals are therefore more grandiose
and less specific, and the targetting more random,'' Schultz says.
</P>
<P>
   This newer brand of terrorism was evident in the 1993 World
Trade Center bombing and a subsequent foiled plot to blow up other
targets in New York. Those two conspiracies brought together
terrorists from the Sudan, Egypt, and Palestinian refugees from
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The two U.S. embassy attacks this month clearly fit this
virulent pattern. For starters, the operations do not appear to
have been executed by an established and identifiable terrorist
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The new terrorism, experts say, has its roots in Afghanistan in
the 1980s, when the US-backed Mujahadeen brought together Muslim
volunteers who fought in the name of Islam against the Soviet
invasion.
</P>
<P>
   But these fighters eventually turned against the United States.
Intelligence agents have a name for the phenomenon when individuals
who once were allies of the United States are now alienated by the
country. They call it ``blow back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the active figures who have emerged in this shadowy
trans-national terrorism come out of Afghanistan. Certainly that is
the case with (millionaire Saudi terrorist leader Osama) bin
Laden,'' says Post.
</P>
<P>
   Although accurate intelligence helped the US military locate and
attack the infrastructure of the bin Laden operation, military
experts fear that this new terrorism will be very difficult to
combat.
</P>
<P>
   US Army Lt. Col. Stephen Gotowick of the Foreign Military
Studies Office wrote in the May/June issue of Military Review:
``The likelihood of preventing or defeating terrorism through
conventional military means is remote.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Scott adds that while the US responded properly Thursday,
the future will not be as clear. ``In addition to immediate strikes
based on solid intelligence, there has to be a diplomatic dimension
to counter terrorism, and the UN and all world organizations have a
role in that,'' he says. ``These failed states, such as Sudan and
Afghanistan, have to be clearly advised that if they want to be
part of the world they cannot harbor terrorism.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton ordered strikes on
terrorist-linked facilities in Sudan and Afghanistan after
obtaining credible evidence that leading members of the
international terrorist network sponsored by Saudi exile Osama bin
Laden, who U.S. officials believe was behind the bombings of two
U.S. embassies in Africa, would be gathering Thursday at a
terrorist camp in Afghanistan to plan further attacks against the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. strike also came after U.S. intelligence and law
enforcement agencies had gathered what officials described as the
strongest evidence ever obtained in a major terrorist case, proving
that bin Laden was behind the embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Senior U.S. officials said the fact that the United States had
gathered such compelling evidence linking bin Laden to the embassy
bombings, coupled with information concerning the scheduled
terrorist conference, led Clinton to plan the strikes for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a confluence of events,'' said a senior U.S.
official.
</P>
<P>
   By targeting the meeting, the United States hoped to badly
damage the ``infrastructure'' of bin Laden's terrorist network.
U.S. officials said they won't be able to assess the damage done at
the terrorist camp until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official said that the U.S. counter-terrorism
center, based at the CIA, ``feels strongly that there is as much
and as rich evidence from a wide variety of sources on this case as
they have ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``Our information was convincing, and we had a
high confidence level that these bombings were planned and carried
out by bin Laden's network. And we had compelling evidence that bin
Laden and his organization were planning further attacks. If we
didn't take action, we were going to get hit, there's no doubt in
our mind.'
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that bin Laden's network was planning attacks at
several sites around the world, including against the U.S. embassy
in Albania. There was also a threat against U.S. interests in
Pakistan, officials added.
</P>
<P>
   The Zhawar Kili terrorist camp, near Khost, Afghanistan, where
the terrorist conference was expected to be held, was hit by U.S.
sea-launched cruise-missiles Thursday. U.S. officials said that bin
Laden had held a similar conference in Afghanistan in January,
apparently to plan attacks against the United States. Bin Laden's
networks have issued new terrorist threats against the United
States since the embassy bombings, and so U.S. officials believe
that the Thursday meeting was to plan future attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had information that something in the camp was going to
take place today,'' said a senior U.S. official. ``It's possible
the meeting was to plan further attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   But one U.S. official said that since May, bin Laden has become
increasingly cautious about his personal security. Prior to that
time, he stayed largely in one place outside Kandhar, Afghanistan
but since then he has been moving frequently, perhaps out of a fear
that his terror campaign would make him more of a target, a U.S.
official said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the U.S. struck a pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum,
Sudan, which U.S. officials said was making a precursor element
used in the production of VX, a poison gas.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official said that bin Laden has been working with
the Sudanese government since 1995 or 1996 to try to develop a
chemical weapons capability. U.S. officials believe that bin Laden
has been working hard to obtain chemical weapons for use in his
terrorist campaign against the United States, although they don't
believe he yet has that capability.
</P>
<P>
   The Al-Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum, struck by U.S.
cruise missiles Thursday, was operated by the Sudanese
military-industrial complex, which has been financially supported
by bin Laden. Officials noted that companies owned and operated by
bin Laden have helped the Sudanese acquire dual-use technology for
use in developing biological and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that Bin Laden has worked with Sudan to test poisonous
gases and to finance simpler methods of manufacturing and
dispensing gas, methods which would be less time-consuming and
expensive than prior Sudanese efforts,'' a U.S. intelligence
official said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials declined to provide a detailed accounting of the
evidence linking bin Laden to the embassy bombings, but they have
strongly suspected his involvement since the day of the attacks.
And they say that as their investigation gained momentum in the
days following the bombings, the links to bin Laden quickly began
to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to other recent major terrorist cases, which have
required months or years to solve, the evidence against bin Laden
in the East Africa bombings came together with remarkable speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had early indications, and over time the information got
better,' a senior U.S. intelligence official said. `We had multiple
sources, and the picture was extremely convincing. You have to be
careful how you weigh early information, but in this case it was
very compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rarely do numerous sources converge so uniformly and
persuasively as they did in the course of our investigation into
the responsibility for these terrorist acts,'' added National
Security Adviser Samuel Berger.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence against bin Laden and his operatives in the East
African bombings is considered conclusive by U.S. officials, yet
the United States intelligence community has been convinced for
years of bin Laden's financial support and involvement in a long
series of attacks against U.S. interests, including the bombings of
U.S. military facilities in Saudi Arabia in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Clinton also revealed a series of other failed attacks
against U.S. or other international interests by bin Laden's
network, including a previously undisclosed plot to kill Pope John
Paul II. A U.S. official said that ``on one of the pope's recent
overseas trips, there were indications that bin Laden operatives
were trying to surveil routes with the intent to cause harm'' to
the pope.

UNABOMBER'S BROTHER RECEIVES $1 MILLION REWARD FROM JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES BROOKE 
 &HT;     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Kaczynski and his wife have been given a $1 million reward
from the Justice Department for turning in David's older brother,
Theodore, as the Unabomber.
</P>
<P>
   David Kaczynski, an upstate New York social worker, has said
that he would give the proceeds of the reward to families of those
killed and injured in his brother's 16 bombings over 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   David Kaczynski told the FBI in 1995 that he suspected that his
brother was responsible for the attacks after he read a 35,000-word
tract from the bomber that was published in The Washington Post.
The manifesto, which was published with joint financing from The
New York Times, echoed many of the anti-technology sentiments he
had heard his brother express.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since his brother's arrest in April 1996, David Kaczynski
has said that he did not go to the FBI out of interest in the
reward, which was offered in October 1993, but out of concern that
more people could be hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Kaczynski killed three men and injured 29 other people
_ a human cross-section that included university professors,
corporate executives, a secretary, a security guard and 12
passengers on an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother and I respect their loss and wish to do whatever we
can to ease their grief,'' Kaczynski said last fall, referring to
his mother, Wanda, who lives near the couple in the Schenectady
area. ``I know that mere money cannot compensate for the loss of a
loved one or rebuild a shattered life.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, he did not return calls left at Equinox, the shelter
for troubled teen-agers where he works. But Anthony Bisceglie, his
lawyer, said that he expected Kaczynski to stick to his plan to
distribute the reward money, after taxes, among the victims and
their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``David has made his intentions clear in the past and I expect
he will stick with those intentions,'' said Bisceglie, who received
the $1 million check at his Washington law office Wednesday. ``The
family will not personally profit from any funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Bisceglie, who served as the initial liaison between David
Kaczynski and the FBI, said he immediately forwarded the check to
Kaczynski and his wife, Linda Patrik, who had conferred and jointly
approached Bisceglie to denounce Kaczynski. The couple is expected
to receive the check Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mechanics have not been worked out'' for distributing the
money, the lawyer said. He added that federal and state taxes could
gobble up almost half of the reward.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski has always said that he was emotionally torn by
turning in his brother.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading up to the Unabom trial earlier this year,
David Kaczynski battled hard to save his brother's life.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors wanted a death sentence for Theodore Kaczynski,
while he refused to accept a defense based on mental incapacity
that could have gotten a life sentence. Last January, as trial was
about to begin, prosecutors agreed to recognize Theodore
Kaczynski's mental illness, to allow him to plead guilty to 13 of
the Unabom crimes, including the three fatal bombings, and to not
seek the death penalty. In May, he received four life sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the hearings in a Sacramento, Calif., courthouse
Theodore Kaczynski never acknowledged his brother's presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that Ted will someday forgive me,'' Kaczynski said.
</P>
<P>
   John Russell, a Justice Department spokesman, said the reward
was ``one of the largest, if not the largest, rewards in history''
in a domestic case. David Kaczynski ``ended a 20-year-plus crime
spree,'' Russell said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the short-lived trial in Sacramento, the victims and the
survivors of the victims met for the first time and bonded into a
close-knit group.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening, two bomb victims did not return telephone
messages. Connie Murray, whose husband, Gilbert, was the
Unabomber's last victim, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through the media, she is aware that David received the award
money, but she is not making any comment,'' said Mindi Russell, a
law enforcement chaplain, who talked to Mrs. Murray. Murray was
killed on April 24, 1995, when he opened a package at his office at
the California Forestry Association, where he was the president.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, David Bischel, the new president of the industry
association, praised David Kaczynski's offer to distribute the
reward money among his brother's victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``His offer to split the reward among the victims was gracious,
and I think reflected his true concern for the families and the
destruction that was wrought by his brother,'' said Bischel, who
attended some of the court proceedings. ``It showed a lot of
strength. The decisions he made in turning his brother in were very
difficult. He did the right thing, and he should be commended for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   After reading the Unabomber manifesto, David Kaczynski combed
through old letters written by his older brother, a former
mathematics professor at the University of California at Berkeley
who had become a hermit in the mountains of western Montana.
</P>
<P>
   He confided his doubts to his mother and to his wife, a
philosophy professor at Union College in Schenectady. Burdened by a
terrible truth, but fearing that more innocent people could be
hurt, he denounced his brother to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone we love went over the edge _ or so it seems,'' he said
later. ``The horror is with us now, and I very much doubt that it
will ever leave us completely.''
</P>
<P>
   After prosecutors dropped their bid for a death penalty, David
Kaczynski, told an interviewer with visible relief: ``It feels to
me like the weight of the world has gone off my shoulders.''

 &HT;    Coca-Cola, Pepsi attorneys take debate to court's cafeteria
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Attorneys for Coca-Cola didn't have to go far to make
their point.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi flows freely in the very courthouse where Pepsico
attorneys argued Thursday that Coca-Cola's ``classic monopolistic
behavior'' has effectively locked out its beverages from the U.S.
fountain soft drink market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Places like the 8th floor cafeteria downstairs that serve
Pepsi have to get that product from someplace,'' attorney Jonathan
M. Jacobson stressed to U.S. District Court Judge Loretta A.
Preska, as he summed up why Coca-Cola Co. thinks Pepsico's
antitrust lawsuit should be thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi is seeking unspecified monetary damages, plus a
restraining order to stop Coca-Cola from barring independent food
service distributors from delivering Pepsi products if they also
carry Coke brands.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, who closed the two-hour hearing in lower Manhattan
with the promise, ``You will have word shortly,'' did not rule on
Coca-Cola's motion to dismiss the suit Thursday. A decision is
expected soon.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed May 7, accuses Atlanta-based Coca-Cola of
using unfair trade practices to control prices and exclude
competition in the fountain soft drink arena, which makes up
roughly $15 billion of the $54 billion U.S. soft drink business.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico's complaint centers on the growing number of
restaurants, movie theaters and other retailers that get the syrup
for their fountain soft drinks from independent food service
distributors. This group of retail customers _ the so-called market
on which the case hinges _ accounts for about $2 billion in annual
wholesale syrup sales, said Pepsico attorney Richard M. Steuer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a shrinking market,'' said Steuer, explaining that
in recent years fountain customers have increasingly turned to
independent food service distributors to get one-stop delivery of
everything from soft drink syrup and cups to buns, hamburger
patties and condiments.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola historically has used such distributors to deliver its
syrup to fountain customers, but only recently began enforcing its
policy of working only with suppliers who didn't also deliver Pepsi
brands.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico contends this started in 1997, when the Purchase,
N.Y.-based company spun off its KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell
divisions and started more actively pursuing contracts for
restaurant fountain accounts. That's also when Pepsico started
trying to farm out its fountain syrup delivery to independent food
service distributors, only to be blocked by Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Steuer told the judge Coca-Cola's message to those distributors
was, ``If you ever let a drop of Pepsi go through your system,
we're going to cut you off.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico contends that Coca-Cola has contracts with companies
that service more than 90 percent of the market that takes fountain
syrup delivery through independent distributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one of an independent food service distributor's customers
wants Pepsi and the distributor honors that request, the
distributor would lose his Coke connection and all of his other
delivery customers unless he can convince those customers to also
switch to Pepsi,'' Steuer said. ``That could be difficult, if
impossible,'' he said, because fountain customers sign lengthy
contracts to carry a given company's beverages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a vicious cycle. It's a chicken and egg (cycle) that can
never be broken,'' he said. ``Coca-Cola has tied up all the
distributors. The food service distributor is a conduit, and
Coca-Cola has contracted with that conduit.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson said Pepsico's argument was flawed, given that there
are other ways to get syrup to the market rather than by using
independent distributors. Among examples he cited are vending
companies, beverage specialists, dedicated commissaries or the
beverage company's own bottling network.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other selling opportunities. Those can't be ignored,
the same way the 8th floor cafeteria can't be ignored,'' Jacobson
said. ``The restaurant has a choice. Does it go to food service
distributors or does it not? They've only focused on the
restaurants that choose to use food service distributors, ignoring
those that don't.''
</P>
<P>
   And because the market at issue represents just $2 billion of
the total U.S. soft drink market by Pepsi's measure _ a figure
Jacobson disputes _ there are questions of whether the submarket is
``economically significant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way we've got a $2 billion market,'' Jacobson told
the judge. ``We could have six years of discovery and a
20-year-long trial to debate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Preska quickly piped in: ``No you can't!''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit deals only with fountain sales, excluding soft
drinks sold in bottles or cans.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts estimate Coca-Cola has two-thirds of the U.S.
fountain business, compared with Pepsi's estimated 24 percent.
Coca-Cola has a 43.9 percent total share of the U.S. carbonated
soft drink market, compared with Pepsi's 30.9 percent share.
Globally, Coca-Cola's market share is 49.7 percent, compared with
Pepsi's 20.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Chief Executive M. Douglas Ivester in June called the
lawsuit _ and others Pepsi has filed against the company over
business in India and France _ ``the tactic of the month'' designed
to hurt Coke's business.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico spokesman Brad Shaw says the company is merely trying to
promote freedom of choice while protecting its right to a level
playing field.

 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel was quick to congratulate the United States
on Thursday night for its missile attacks on suspected terrorist
bases, but the early reaction from most other governments in the
Middle East was a notable silence.
</P>
<P>
   And while Israeli officials hailed the American operation as
courageous, television reports in parts of the Arab world featured
irate calls from viewers who denounced the strikes as unjust and
immoral.
</P>
<P>
   Those contrasts seemed to point to the depth of conflicting
emotions that the American attacks had already begun to stir.
Israelis, who have suffered more recent terrorist attacks than any
other country, saw the operation as vindication of their own calls
for confrontation toward Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said the American raids had
underscored the fact that ``the war against terror everywhere is
never-ending and necessary in order to ensure stability and
security around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Arab governments that have fought long battles against
terrorism seemed cautious about adopting a similar public stance.
Many Arab leaders have criticized what they call the imbalance in
American policy in the region and may be attuned to the possibility
that their citizens may regard the American raids less as strikes
against terror than as attacks on Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Among Arab countries, Egypt may have been typical in that its
state-run television station broadcast news about the American
attack without any comment from the Egyptian government. The raids
were launched on the eve of the Muslim holy day, and in Jerusalem
Israeli authorities said they were concerned that Friday prayer
gatherings in the walled old city could become the setting for
anti-American demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Only Libya, itself the target of a 1986 American air raid that
was characterized as retaliation for terrorism, was explicit in
condemning American attacks on targets in Sudan and Afghanistan.
The Libyan leader, Muammar Gadhafi, whose own home was hit in the
1986 raid, was reported by Libyan state television to have
telephoned President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan to express
support in this ``fight against aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Thursday evening, Libyan television had interrupted
its regular programming to begin carrying live broadcasts from
Sudanese television showing flames rising from a factory hit in the
American raids. American officials said the factory had produced an
ingredient necessary to make chemical weapons, but Sudan's
information minister, Ghazi Salah Eddin, said it had been nothing
more than a medical installation.
</P>
<P>
   But a more telling gauge of the hostility with which ordinary
Arabs were responding to the operation could be heard on some
Arabic-language television call-in shows, including one broadcast
by Sudan television. In a portion that was broadcast live by CNN on
Thursday night, a number of callers expressed solidarity with Sudan
and denounced the United States and an American president whom some
suggested was trying to turn attention away from personal and
political problems involving his relationship with a former White
House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Several callers identified themselves as being from Saudi
Arabia, whose government is a close ally of the United States but
where many citizens have deep misgivings about those ties. One
caller who did not give his name but said he was calling from
Riyadh, the Saudi capital, said of Clinton, ``The way out for him
was basically to carry out an operation that would divert attention
from his own lies and problems by attacking sites in Sudan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows that the strongest power on earth is being led
now by a liar,'' the Sudanese host agreed. ``How would we know that
what he says isn't a lie?''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Thursday night, American officials took pains to
try to muffle Arab protests. Clinton declared that ``our actions
were not aimed against Islam,'' and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said she had been in touch with other world leaders _
including Arabs _ and that they had been ``very supportive of our
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to echo American assertions made earlier this year
that there was broad Arab backing for a possible military attack
against Iraq. In that instance, however, concern about a possible
public backlash against a strike on brother Muslims led most Arab
leaders to publicly warn against such an attack, and the United
States ultimately opted to find a way out of the confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for Arab unhappiness with American policy in the
Middle East remains a perception that the United States is leaning
too far toward Israel in negotiations aimed at forging a broader
Arab-Israeli peace.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Israeli officials sometimes complain that their
American counterparts are not sufficiently sensitive to their
country's security concerns, and to the importance of retaliating
swiftly and ruthlessly to acts of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday night, Israeli officials were repeating with
evident satisfaction what has long been their mantra. ``If we let
our fear of retaliation by the terrorists rule our action or
inaction, we will have handed terrorism the ultimate victory,''
said David Bar Illan, the spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.

US MILITARY RESPONSE TO TERRORISM UNUSUAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By unleashing missile attacks on two terrorist centers Thursday,
the United States made an uncharacteristically bold assault on
international terrorism, departing from a long history of seeking
out suspects through other means.
</P>
<P>
   Previous terrorist attacks _ from the 1988 bombing of Pan
American Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, to the 1996 bombing
of US Air Force barracks in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia _ have prompted
US investigations and manhunts. But rarely has the US swooped into
a foreign country so quickly to retaliate _ in part, because of the
elusive nature of terrorism itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been times when we simply haven't had the
information to respond,'' said retired Rear Adm. Eugene Carroll,
deputy director of the Washington-based Center for Defense
Information. ``Terrorists have gone to great lengths to conceal
their means and their modalities. I think that's the reason we
haven't done anything about (the 1996 attack on the Saudi) Khobar
Towers until now.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after President Ronald Reagan's 1986 condemnation of Libyan
support for terrorist attacks _ ``If we can find them, we will kill
them,'' he vowed _ direct military retaliation has been rare.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last 15 years, at least eight terrorist explosions
have killed hundreds of Americans. New York's World Trade Center.
The embassy and military barracks in Beirut. US military training
camps in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Yet only one _ the bombing of a Berlin nightclub on April 5,
1986 _ brought a reaction as massive as Thursday's.
</P>
<P>
   In that instance, in the wake of an explosion that killed two US
airmen and injured another 230, and following reports that Libyan
terrorists planned to attack again, Reagan ordered an air strike on
Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force F-111s and Navy jets strafed Libya just 10 days after
the Berlin explosion, in a military response hailed by some as the
only appropriate choice.
</P>
<P>
   US officials acted immediately because they were able to ``get
the information and intelligence as to the perpetrator,'' said
Michael O'Hanlon, a fellow at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We responded and retaliated through military reprisal, not too
much unlike'' Thursday, O'Hanlon said.
</P>
<P>
   But there were severe repercussions as a result of that
full-scale approach.
</P>
<P>
   The residence of Libyan leader Col. Moammar Khadafy was bombed
during the raid, killing his adopted baby daughter and injuring two
of his sons.
</P>
<P>
   One official said at the time that it was ``the price he's going
to have to pay for continued terrorism,'' but two years later, Pan
American Flight 103 was blasted out of the sky, in an apparent
retaliation that was far worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took great solace and pleasure in announcing to the world
that we had put Khadafy in his place,'' Carroll said. ``And bang,
there goes an airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   The pursuit of the two suspects in the plane crash, Abdel Basset
Ali Al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, was far quieter, as
investigators and intelligence officials traced their steps and
fought to bring them to trial.
</P>
<P>
   But fear of retaliation has been only one concern, US experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason: United Nations regulations, which permit ``self
defense'' or ``prevention,'' but not eye-for-eye retaliation,
according to Andrew Winner, a senior staff member at the Institute
for Foreign Policy analysis in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest obstacle to fighting terrorist violence with
violence, however, is the great difficulty connected with
indicting, then tracking, terrorists _ especially those who, like
Osama bin Laden, are not officially sanctioned by any state.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got groups that are fragmented and small, it's
very difficult to know where they are,'' said Jeswald Salacuse,
professor of international conflict and law at Tufts' Fletcher
School of Law and Diplomacy in Malden, Mass. ``When you've got a
group that's not affiliated with a state and that is mobile, it's
very difficult to go after them.''
</P>
<P>
   In light of those limitations, the US record is ``respectable,''
said O'Hanlon, the Brookings defense expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a grade B, or B-minus, not terrible, not great,'' he
said. ``We have gotten some people and not others. ...Overall, our
record is respectable in that we have gotten some people and not
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Said one senior intelligence official said during a Pentagon
briefing Thursday: ``Rarely do numerous sources converge so
uniformly and persuasively as they have in this instance. After
following many terrorist events, rarely have we come to some
conclusions as fast as we did; rarely has been the quality of what
we collected as high as it has been.''

LEWINSKY TESTIFIES AGAIN BEFORE GRAND JURY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trim; also, times are cq) 
 
By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky appeared before a federal grand
jury again Thursday as questions arose over possible conflicts
between President Clinton's testimony and information provided
earlier by the former White House intern and other witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, the woman at the heart of the presidential sex
scandal, spent about four hours with the panel responding to
questions about her 18-month affair with Clinton, including details
from their trysts and what the president may have done to hide
their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old former White House intern ``answered all
questions truthfully and completely,'' said Judy Smith, a Lewinsky
family spokeswoman who indicated that Thursday's grand jury
appearance probably would be Lewinsky's last.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Lewinsky is really looking forward to beginning the
process of rebuilding her life,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a poll released Thursday indicates that public
opinion of the president has slipped in the wake of his nationally
televised appearance Monday night in which he confessed an improper
relationship with Lewinsky and lying about it for the past seven
months.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of Americans surveyed by ABC News believe Clinton has
obstructed justice and three-fourths of Americans say he is not
trustworthy and does not have high moral standards. The survey was
conducted before the president ordered military strikes against
terrorist facilities in Afghanistan and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's announcement of the strikes eclipsed plans by some
television news networks to broadcast Lewinsky's departure from the
courthouse, which happened at 2 p.m., EDT. Wearing a gray
double-breasted suit and sunglasses, Lewinsky left the building as
she arrived just before 9 a.m., EDT _ in a sports utility vehicle
and without commenting.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky was called back to the grand jury to address
inconsistencies prosecutors reportedly found between her testimony
Aug. 6 and what Clinton said during his unprecedented appearance
before the panel Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's testimony is critical to the investigation by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr into whether Clinton lied under
oath when questioned in January as part of the sexual harassment
lawsuit filed against him by Paula Jones. Starr also is examining
whether the president or his associates obstructed justice by
trying to cover up his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular interest to Starr's prosecutors, said a source
familiar with Lewinsky's appearance Thursday, were specifics from
her sexual encounters with Clinton and how she came to return gifts
he had given her.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky reportedly told the grand jury two weeks ago that she
performed oral sex on the president and that they engaged in
intimate touching.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the first president to testify before a grand jury
investigating his actions, read a statement confessing to an
improper, 18-month relationship with Lewinsky that included
intimate physical contact. When questioned by prosecutors, he
balked at providing details.
</P>
<P>
   Citing sources familiar with Clinton's testimony, both The
Washington Post, The Associated Press and several television news
organizations reported that during his testimony Clinton
specifically acknowledged that Lewinsky performed oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a source familiar with Clinton's testimony said the
president never specifically acknowledged any sexual conduct
involving Lewinsky. Instead, each time he was asked, the president
would reply that he had ``already said it was improper,'' referring
to his statement in which he contended that the type of sex he had
with Lewinsky did not fall under the definition of sex used in
Jones' lawsuit, said the source who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual relations was defined in the Jones case as an instance
``when the person knowingly engages in or causes ... contact with
the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any
person with intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any
person.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a source familiar with Lewinsky's Aug. 6 testimony,
she told grand jurors that she and Clinton met privately Dec. 28,
nine days after she had been subpoenaed to testify in Jones'
lawsuit and to turn over any gifts he had given her. At the meeting
they discussed returning the gifts to him through his personal
secretary Betty Currie.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky and Clinton reportedly testified that he suggested that
she would have to turn over any gifts still in her possession.
According to The Washington Post, Lewinsky on Aug. 6 told the grand
jury that Currie showed up at her Watergate apartment to pick-up
the gifts, which included a T-shirt, a pin, a book of poems and an
autographed copy of a State of the Union speech.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton adviser familiar with his testimony said the
president knew nothing about Currie retrieving the gifts and did
not direct her to do it. ``The gifts just aren't an issue as far as
we're concerned,'' the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   During his televised speech Monday, Clinton said he did not
``ask anyone to lie, to hide or destroy evidence or to take any
other unlawful action.''
</P>
<P>
   Currie, who has testified before Starr's grand jury five times,
turned the gifts over to his investigators.

CLINTON ANTI-TERROR STRIKE WAS DIFFICULT, BUT RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - So much for the experts.
</P>
<P>
   The pundits proclaimed the Clinton administration was on the
ropes, the president about to collapse in the far corner of the
ring.
</P>
<P>
   But never - ever - count Bill Clinton out.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the fates handed him an opportunity for some redemption in
presidential leadership, and he did not disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   In retaliation for the bloody embassy bombings in East Africa
two weeks ago, in which 12 Americans and nearly 300 Kenyans and
Tanzanians lost their lives, Clinton ordered U.S. forces to attack
terrorist camps in Afghanistan as well as a chemical plant in Sudan
linked to terrorist Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reminded the nation that bin Laden publicly vowed to
wage a terrorist war against America, saying, ``We do not
differentiate between those dressed in military uniforms and
civilians. They are all targets.``
</P>
<P>
   The terrorists' mission was murder, said the president, and
their history is bloody.
</P>
<P>
   So Clinton did the correct but difficult thing. Difficult?
</P>
<P>
   It is always difficult to order military action, if only because
of the possibility for collateral damage to innocents. But this
time, the president had the extra burden of the ``Wag-the-Dog``
syndrome - a skeptical public cynically wondering whether this
action was a calculated diversion to send the public's attention
skipping off to an international crisis and away from that
DNA-stained dress.
</P>
<P>
   The president, whom we now know to be a dishonest man, created
this cynicism with his own actions.
</P>
<P>
   But he is, after all, the president. And yesterday, at long
last, he acted presidential, striking against terrorism with
stealth and finesse.
</P>
<P>
   This strong act of resolve comes in the wake of an embarrassing
retreat from a tough stand against Saddam Hussein when the Iraqi
dictator refused to allow United Nations weapons inspectors access
to sites that might be used for nuclear, chemical or biological
weapons development.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Secretary of State Madeleine Albright recently acknowledged
that she had urged U.N. weapons inspectors to discontinue
unannounced U.N. inspections in Iraq. Wouldn't want to upset
Saddam, you see. U.S. resolve had atrophied and Saddam Hussein knew
it.
</P>
<P>
   But then ... the United States struck back in Afghanistan and in
Sudan. Suddenly the U.S. had a commander in chief - allowing us to
be proud, however briefly, once again.

ENTERTAINMENT, REALITY COLLIDE IN STRIKE ON TERRORISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The line between fantasy and reality, between Hollywood and
Washington, has blurred into invisibility in this decade of
cynicism and disillusionment, in this culture of entertainment
above all else. But it snapped clearly back into view Thursday in
the wake of President Clinton's decision to bomb terrorist camps in
Afghanistan and the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   That a Hollywood movie should figure in any discussion of
Thursday's events shows only how skewed our collective sense of
so-called reality has become. One element of Thursday's reaction
consisted of cynical analogies between the US actions and the
political satire ``Wag the Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Wag the Dog,'' Robert De Niro's spin doctor and Dustin
Hoffman's Hollywood producer stage a phony war to divert attention
from a presidential sex scandal. They fill TV screens and
newspapers with faked images of pathos and made-up heroics of a war
America is told is taking place in the Balkans, but in reality is
unfolding on a sound stage. In doing so, they minimize coverage of
the president's peccadilloes.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the splash made by ``Wag the Dog,'' now available on
video, was the fact that it had just gone into wide release when
the Monica Lewinsky story broke in January. Clinton and those who
stand by his actions say the bombings were not politically
motivated, that the current scandal was not the reason for the air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, Senator Dan Coats (R-Ind.) questioned the timing
of the air attacks, given the president's personal difficulties.
Senator Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) seconded him, adding in a milder vein
that the president's problems have to be on the minds of many
people. When special prosecutor Kenneth Starr was asked if he had
seen the movie, he laughed and said he shouldn't comment, but yes,
he had.
</P>
<P>
   Most members of Congress, including the President's severest
critics, closed ranks behind him. And a newly sobered America will
decide how much weight should be given to the skeptical
questioning, how appropriate it is to push the parallel between
fact and fantasy, whether the links between ``Wag the Dog'' and
Thursday's events represent oracular revelation or a conspiracy
theorist's wildest dreams come true.

   ``Just Because I'm Latin Doesn't Mean I Mambo: A Success Guide
for Hispanic Americans''
</P>
<P>
   By Juan Roberto Job
</P>
<P>
   Ballantine Publishing Group
</P>
<P>
   $22.95, 241 pages
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   One of the nation's biggest minorities is getting ready to flex
its economic muscles in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic community is ``where the action is,'' according to
author and speaker Juan Roberto Job.
</P>
<P>
   And their numbers are starting to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics are the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population
and are projected to become the largest minority in 2005. By 2050,
one out of four Americans will be Hispanic, outnumbering all other
minorities combined.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers translate into more dollars for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics annually buy $190 billion in goods and services
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that economic influence, corporate America is still
reluctant to embrace this emerging market, Job says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although mainstream America is starting to acknowledge the
importance of the Latino community, we are not easy to categorize
or understand,'' Job said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Latinos come in all shapes and sizes, from lots of
different backgrounds. We have many things in common but are
extremely diverse.''
</P>
<P>
   That richness and diversity of culture can be difficult to
market to, Job writes. It can also go against the conservative,
traditional grain of corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   Even though companies such as Sears, Coca-Cola and Office Depot
have had Hispanics in top executive positions, only 249 Hispanics
executives are at the level of vice president or above out of the
Fortune 1,000 companies last year.
</P>
<P>
   And although there are 2 million Hispanics with college degrees
in this country, the national Glass Ceiling Commission found that
most chief executives of major corporations think that only a few
Hispanics are eligible for top executive positions, Job writes.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare the Hispanic community for the opportunities and
requirements of corporate America, Job has written ``Just Because
I'm Latin Doesn't Mean I Mambo: A Success Guide for Hispanic
Americans'' (Ballentine Publishing Group, New York, 241 pages,
$22.95) The book offers a frank discussion on what it takes to
succeed in corporate America and offers practical advice on
overcoming the stereotypes that may stand in the way of getting
there.
</P>
<P>
   Many Hispanics will be entering unknown territory as they embark
on a corporate career, Job writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Latinos grow up in environments removed from the world of
business. Our fathers might be civil-service workers or mechanics.
Our mothers might be teachers or full-time homemakers,'' he writes.
``We have to learn about corporate America from observing and
listening to others.'' The key is adapting to the new environment,
Job suggests. And that may mean changing ingrained habits and
behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Hispanics are traditionally a modest group, Job
says, yet self-promotion is vital to a successful corporate career.
Extended family ties are also traditional to most Hispanics, yet
corporate careers can mean long hours at the office and extensive
travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cultural paradigms of corporate America tend to reflect
the Anglo-Saxon model,'' Job writes. ``As a result, Latinos who
want to pursue a business career often face tough personal choices
about values.'' Ultimately, everyone must decide on his or her own
priorities and ability or willingness to compromise, Job writes.
</P>
<P>
   This books discusses other issues relating to corporate life,
including education, unwritten rules and codes, career advancement
strategies and mentoring. A list of Hispanic professional
organizations and employee associations is provided in the back.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous stories and quotes by Hispanics in the business world
help bring this book to life.

FDA URGED TO STRENGTHEN VIAGRA WARNING LABEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Viagra, the impotence pill, may be dangerous to more
people than previously reported, a finding that has prompted two
cardiology groups to urge doctors to exercise caution when
prescribing the drug.
</P>
<P>
   In light of this and other information, Public Citizen, a
consumer group, petitioned the Food and Drug Administration on
Thursday to review Viagra's side effects and strengthen its warning
label.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is reviewing the request, said Brad Stone, an agency
spokesman. ``We've just gotten the letter and haven't gotten a
chance to analyze it fully,'' he said. ``On the basis of the best
data we have, we still believe that Viagra is a safe and effective
drug when used as labeled.''
</P>
<P>
   Viagra's label warns against prescribing the drug to people who
are taking heart medicine containing nitrates because of the
potential for developing life-threatening low blood pressure. The
FDA has reported 39 deaths of American men who have used Viagra.
Six of the men were taking nitroglycerine, a nitrate drug, and the
others had one or more risk factors for coronary artery disease.
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement issued on Aug. 10, the American College of
Cardiology and the American Heart Association said Viagra was
``potentially hazardous'' to several groups of patients who were
not taking these drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The groups include patients with these conditions: active
coronary ischemia, which is insufficient blood flow to the heart;
congestive heart failure; borderline low blood pressure and
borderline low blood volume. Others at risk are people with
hypertension who are taking more than one drug, and those who are
taking drugs like erythromycin or Cimetidine, or who have
conditions, like kidney or liver disease, that can delay Viagra's
breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Adolph M. Hutter Jr., co-chairman of the committee that
developed the statement, said that Viagra could cause a dangerously
sharp drop in blood pressure in these patients. Hutter said he did
not think the drop would be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Hutter said the committee had not based its statement on actual
cases, but on a review of the scientific literature on Viagra. He
said that the committee was still studying the drug's effects and
would issue a complete report this year.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at Public Citizen conducted a separate review of the
literature and of FDA documents on Viagra and found several other
possibly dangerous side effects that had not been made public. The
group's petition said that facts about these dangers ``are either
not discussed or misrepresented in the FDA-approved labeling for
Viagra.''
</P>
<P>
   The petition said that the label did not mention animal studies
that found that Viagra caused perarteritis, a severe inflammation
of blood vessels. Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's
Health Research Group, said that the FDA pharmacology review of
Viagra concluded that this finding ``may be a cause for concern''
in humans.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Viagra label states that a side effect is ``blue''
vision, the petition said that the drug may cause more severe
vision problems. Viagra suppresses levels of one enzyme,
phosphodiesterase, to maintain high levels of cyclic guanosine
monophosphate, which causes erections. But, Wolfe said, studies
have shown that inactive phosphodiesterase and an accumulation of
cyclic guanosine monophosphate can lead to rapid degeneration of
the retina. The petition urged the FDA to determine whether
repeated use of Viagra could cause such deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   Public Citizen contends that questions exist because Viagra was
rushed to market last March in response to publicity.

   EDIT-TERROR (Undated) - So much for the experts. The pundits
proclaimed the Clinton administration was on the ropes, the
president about to collapse in the far corner of the ring.
</P>
<P>
   But never - ever - count Bill Clinton out. Alas, the fates
handed him an opportunity for some redemption in presidential
leadership, and he did not disappoint. Story moved in the ``K``

   &QL;  GIBBONS QUESTIONS CLINTON'S MOTIVES
</P>
<P>
   By Mark D. Preston
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Aug. 20 -- Rep. Jim Gibbons, R-Nev., questioned the
timing of President Clinton's decision to launch simultaneous
missile attacks against terrorist bases in Afghanistan and Sudan
Thursday, saying it might be an attempt to shift focus away from
his personal problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reaction today with military force raises some very serious
questions as to whether or not this was based on some attempts to
cloud (Clinton's) personal problems, or if it truly involved
national security,'' said Gibbons, a member of both the House
Select Intelligence Committee and House National Security
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly have doubts about today's strike,'' Gibbons said.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons was not alone in questioning Clinton's decision, three
days after the president admitted to an extra-marital affair with
former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., and Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., also
suggested Clinton called for the missile attack to divert attention
away from his personal problems. Specter later said he supported
the president's decision after talking with U.S. military advisors
during an appearance on CNN's Crossfire.
</P>
<P>
   But Nevada's two Democratic senators and Republican Congressman
said the president's timing was appropriate in response to the
recent two U.S. Embassy bombings in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., a member of the Senate Select
Intelligence Committee, said he supported the president's decision
to strike against the terrorist bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has the duty to take action, and he did,'' Bryan
said. ``I don't think the (missile strike) was unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said, ``This is not about the
president. This is about national security. It is ridiculous and
insulting to make the assumption that the Secretary and Defense and
Joint Chiefs of Staff would ever act for political purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The actions appear that they were absolutely necessary,'' said
Rep. John Ensign, R-Nev. ``I support them.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. strike began at about 1:30 p.m. EDT when long-range
cruise missiles were launched at an alleged chemical weapons plant
in Sudan and six terrorist bases in Afghanistan. U.S. aircraft were
not used in the strikes, which helped to keep the mission a secret
until after it happened, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the sites are linked to Osama bid
Laden, a wealthy Saudi millionaire and a well known terrorist
supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Osama bid Laden is widely suspected of orchestrating two
bombings that took place minutes apart two weeks ago that killed
257 people including 12 Americans and leveled two U.S. Embassies in
Tanzania and Kenya. Osama bid Laden, who is also linked to the
World Trade Center Bombing in New York City and a handful of other
terrorist acts in the past six years, apparently survived the air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Reid and Ensign who are battling one another in this year's
Senate race appear to agree on how the U.S. should deal with
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Reid said, ``We cannot afford to let rogue states and
organizations attack Americans and American property,'' Reid said.
``Protecting our national security must be the nation's first and
foremost concern at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ensign said U.S. citizens must band together to overcome the
terrorist threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``This terrorist organization has declared holy war against the
United States, and we as Americans must join together to win it,''
Ensign said.

AS HELP ARRIVES, CONGO OFFICIALS REJECT TALKS WITH REBELS

<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo _ A day after several African governments
pledged to help President Laurent Kabila repel an attack on his
government, a leader of the rebellion said he was willing to
negotiate a cease-fire in the 18-day war that is increasingly
becoming a political battleground for rival African nations.
</P>
<P>
   But while the government had not officially responded to the
offer Thursday night, aides to Kabila said they would hold no talks
with the rebels, who control eastern Congo and are advancing toward
the capital here from the southwest.
</P>
<P>
   In Goma, a city on the eastern border with Rwanda, which is
backing the revolt, Wamba dia Wamba, a leader of the rebels, said
they were prepared for a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ready for negotiations with Kabila because we believe
the problems of the Congo are political and beg a political
solution,'' dia Wamba said, according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   government officials rejected meetings with the rebels, although
they left open the possibility of direct talks with the Rwandan
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would we negotiate with them?'' a member of Kabila's
Cabinet said, referring to the rebels. ``To discuss? To discuss
what?''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels came under political pressure Wednesday after several
countries, including Zimbabwe, Kenya and Angola, said they would
supply military assistance to Kabila's forces. State television
showed foreign troops arriving at the airport here Thursday night,
but did not specify their country of origin.
</P>
<P>
   The South African government is also pressing both sides to
resolve the conflict peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting, meanwhile, continued in the region southwest of
the capital. In their march toward Kinshasa, the rebels claimed to
have seized Mbanza-Ngungu, an important city about 75 miles
southwest of the capital to which the government had sent troops
and military equipment. The aides to Kabila denied the rebels'
assertion, which could not be confirmed independently.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday in Kinshasa, electrical power returned briefly for a
few hours for the first time since Monday. But by nightfall, the
rebels, who control the enormous Inga hydroelectric dam on the
Congo River, cut off power again, leaving Kinshasa and nearby
Brazzaville, in the neighboring Congo Republic, in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   War preparations could be seen all over the city Thursday in
ways large and small. On Avenue de la Victoire, a 13-year-old boy
approached a businessman talking to a reporter and asked for change
to take the bus. The boy did not want to be late for work; he had
to report to his army unit or risk suspicion that he had deserted.
</P>
<P>
   At the airport, where major airlines have not landed in days,
two military helicopters touched down in the afternoon. Small
airplanes shuttled passengers who wanted to leave the country
across the Congo River into Brazzaville.
</P>
<P>
   Officials canceled the return visas of foreigners flying out of
the city. And soldiers forbade a dozen women trying to leave the
country from entering the airport, saying they were ethnic Tutsi.
The Congolese Tutsi, who are concentrated in eastern Congo, are
believed to be leading the war against Kabila along with the
Rwandan Tutsi.
</P>
<P>
   The Tutsi, with Uganda, are the forces that put Kabila at the
head of the rebellion that ended the 32-year dictatorship of Mobutu
Sese Seko. When Kabila assumed power 15 months ago, his ties to the
Rwandans made him extremely unpopular among his countrymen. But he
eventually cut himself off from the Rwandans, setting the stage for
this conflict.
</P>
<P>
   As the fall of Kinshasa appeared inevitable early this week,
Kabila flew to other countries, searching for military support and
exposing through his actions the continent's national rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda's competitors, led by Zimbabwe, said they
would supply arms, men and other military equipment to Kabila. At
the same time, though, South Africa pressed for negotiations
between both sides, saying it disagreed with the actions of its
diplomatic rival, Zimbabwe.

AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL TO BUY SUNAMERICA IN $16.7B DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Insurance giant American International Group Inc. has
agreed to buy SunAmerica Inc. in an $16.7 billion stock deal that
represents a big bet on the financial needs of the nation's aging
population and poses a stiff new challenge to firms like John
Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the second largest ever in the American insurance
industry after Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s $22 billion purchase of
General Re Corp. in June, and is the latest in a string of
megamergers designed to consolidate the nation's financial services
sector and focus it on individuals rather than corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a demographic play,'' said Jeffrey Hopson, an analyst
with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Co. in St Louis. ``People are getting older.
They have unfunded liabilities, whether it's health or retirement,
and they need financial services.''
</P>
<P>
   The purchase marks the first big step that AIG has taken into
the US consumer market and, as such, is a mirror-image of other
recent megamergers, like the Citicorp-Travelers Group deal, which
were designed to extend the reach of US-based companies around the
world. Although AIG is headquartered in New York, it makes most of
its money overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will bring together two of the financial industry's
most strong-willed executives, AIG chairman and Maurice Greenberg
and SunAmerica chairman and Eli Broad. The prospect of competing
against the pair had other insurance executives speaking in hushed
and respectful tones Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are two of the smartest, toughest guys in the
business,'' said Hancock president David F. D'Alessandro. ``What
other companies in this business should fear is that the combined,
low-cost structure will cause product prices to drop.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance industry analysts said the purchase solves problems
for both companies, providing AIG with a popular product and a US
sales network and helping SunAmerica to expand overseas.
</P>
<P>
   AIG now sells business and individual life insurance in 130
countries, many in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   SunAmerica specializes in variable annuities, a kind of hybrid
insurance policy-mutual fund. The product has been the
fastest-growing segment of the US life insurance business in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg was quoted by Bloomberg News as telling analysts he
believes that variable annuities are the financial product of the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this wil be one of the fastest-growing businesses
that exist,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts expressed surprise at the roughly $75-per-share
price that AIG has agreed to pay for Los Angeles-based SunAmerica,
saying it is steep by current standards and out of character for
Greenberg, who until now has been willing to pay only
bargain-basement rates for acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of investor displeasure, AIG shares fell 7 1/8
Thursday to 87 1/2, their largest decline in 10 years and a tumble
that shrank AIG's market value more than $7.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said the purchase could end up looking like a smart
move if, as some predict, Congress passes legislation that permits
banks to buy insurance companies for the first time since the
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happens and there's a feeding frenzy, Hank Greenberg
will look like he got a steal,'' said one observer, who asked not
to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   AIG has tried to enter the US consumer market in the past by
building its own sales network and by buying other firms. Earlier
this year, it lost out to now-crippled Cendant Corp. in bidding for
Miami-based American Bankers Insurance Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   AIG has made its mark in the financial industry by entering
businesses like aircraft leasing that others shunned.
</P>
<P>
   Under Broad, SunAmerica has expanded rapidly by building a sales
force of 9,500 agents and offering 20 mutual funds as part of its
variable annuities. According to Bloomberg, its stock has risen an
average of 49 percent a year for the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Broad, 65, and SunAmerica vice chairman Jay Wintrob, 41, are
expected to join the AIG board when the purchase is completed later
this year or early next.

   ``Just Because I'm Latin Doesn't Mean I Mambo: A Success Guide
for Hispanic Americans''
</P>
<P>
   By Juan Roberto Job
</P>
<P>
   Ballantine Publishing Group
</P>
<P>
   $22.95, 241 pages
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   One of the nation's biggest minorities is getting ready to flex
its economic muscles in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic community is ``where the action is,'' according to
author and speaker Juan Roberto Job.
</P>
<P>
   And their numbers are starting to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics are the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population
and are projected to become the largest minority in 2005. By 2050,
one out of four Americans will be Hispanic, outnumbering all other
minorities combined.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers translate into more dollars for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics annually buy $190 billion in goods and services
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that economic influence, corporate America is still
reluctant to embrace this emerging market, Job says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although mainstream America is starting to acknowledge the
importance of the Latino community, we are not easy to categorize
or understand,'' Job said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Latinos come in all shapes and sizes, from lots of
different backgrounds. We have many things in common but are
extremely diverse.''
</P>
<P>
   That richness and diversity of culture can be difficult to
market to, Job writes. It can also go against the conservative,
traditional grain of corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   Even though companies such as Sears, Coca-Cola and Office Depot
have had Hispanics in top executive positions, only 249 Hispanics
executives are at the level of vice president or above out of the
Fortune 1,000 companies last year.
</P>
<P>
   And although there are 2 million Hispanics with college degrees
in this country, the national Glass Ceiling Commission found that
most chief executives of major corporations think that only a few
Hispanics are eligible for top executive positions, Job writes.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare the Hispanic community for the opportunities and
requirements of corporate America, Job has written ``Just Because
I'm Latin Doesn't Mean I Mambo: A Success Guide for Hispanic
Americans'' (Ballentine Publishing Group, New York, 241 pages,
$22.95) The book offers a frank discussion on what it takes to
succeed in corporate America and offers practical advice on
overcoming the stereotypes that may stand in the way of getting
there.
</P>
<P>
   Many Hispanics will be entering unknown territory as they embark
on a corporate career, Job writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Latinos grow up in environments removed from the world of
business. Our fathers might be civil-service workers or mechanics.
Our mothers might be teachers or full-time homemakers,'' he writes.
``We have to learn about corporate America from observing and
listening to others.'' The key is adapting to the new environment,
Job suggests. And that may mean changing ingrained habits and
behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Hispanics are traditionally a modest group, Job
says, yet self-promotion is vital to a successful corporate career.
Extended family ties are also traditional to most Hispanics, yet
corporate careers can mean long hours at the office and extensive
travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cultural paradigms of corporate America tend to reflect
the Anglo-Saxon model,'' Job writes. ``As a result, Latinos who
want to pursue a business career often face tough personal choices
about values.'' Ultimately, everyone must decide on his or her own
priorities and ability or willingness to compromise, Job writes.
</P>
<P>
   This books discusses other issues relating to corporate life,

   WASHINGTON _ Dozens of U.S. cruise missiles struck targets in
Afghanistan and Sudan on Thursday in what President Clinton
described as an act of self-defense against imminent terrorist
plots and of fearsome retribution for the bombings of U.S.
embassies in East Africa two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes were launched from ships in the Arabian Sea and Red
Sea, executed under the cover of darkness with no U.S. casualties.
With 75 missiles aimed to explode simultaneously in unsuspecting
countries on two continents, the operation was the most formidable
U.S. military assault ever against a private sponsor of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The targets were identified by Pentagon officials as an
extensive terrorism training complex in Afghanistan, 94 miles south
of Kabul, and a factory for the building blocks of chemical weapons
near Khartoum, Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his national security team linked both sites to
Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi millionaire tied by U.S.
intelligence to the twin bombings on August 7 in Kenya and
Tanzania, which killed 12 Americans and nearly 300 Africans. Bin
Laden, who is in Afghanistan, apparently survived the attack, which
officials insisted was not aimed at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let our actions today send this message loud and clear,''
Clinton said in an address from the Oval Office. ``There are no
expendable American targets. There will be no sanctuary for
terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   The president made no apologies for ordering the strikes without
permission from Afghanistan or Sudan, saying that ``countries that
persistently host terrorists have no right to be safe havens.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton returned to the White House this afternoon from his
vacation on Martha's Vineyard, where he was trying to repair family
relations damaged by his admission Monday of an intimate
relationship with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said they had no immediate estimate of damage
or casualties, although Defense Secretary William Cohen said the
strikes were designed to ``cause sufficient damage to disrupt them
for some time.'' Sudanese television this afternoon broadcast
images of a ravaged, burning factory under a night sky stained
orange.
</P>
<P>
   The president presented several reasons for the decision to act
swiftly and forcefully, rather than to try to punish bin Laden
through means of diplomacy and law enforcement. Repeatedly, he said
that bin Laden presented an imminent threat, quoting his vow this
week to wage a war in which Americans were ``all targets.'' He
added that ``key terrorist leaders'' were believed to be gathering
at the compound in Afghanistan on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had ``convincing'' intelligence that bin Laden's
terrorist network was behind the embassy bombings. And he accused
groups tied to bin Laden of a host of murderous attacks and foiled
plots, from killing international peacekeepers in Somalia to
planning to assassinate the pope.
</P>
<P>
   But, while the Republican leadership rallied to support the
raids, some congressmen reacted suspiciously, noting that the
action followed by just three days Clinton's acknowledgement to the
public and a grand jury of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Administration officials scorned talk of any connection.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton's motorcade abruptly left the borrowed estate where
he was secluded with his wife and daughter, reporters and
photographers idling at the entrance assumed he was going to play
golf. They reluctantly abandoned the movie that they had begun to
watch, ``Wag the Dog,'' about a fictional president who
manufactures a phony war to distract the nation from an adulterous
liason.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton made a brief, dramatic appearance to announce
the strikes. Then, in a feat of unparalleled one-upsmanship after a
summer of jaw-dropping juxtapositions, Clinton flew to Washington
for his Oval Office address as Ms. Lewinsky was testifying for a
second time before the grand jury here.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that planning for the mission
began nine days ago, shortly after the embassy bombings August 7.
Clinton was first informed of the planning in the White House
situation room Aug. 12, and on Aug. 14 he gave tentative approval
for a mission. He gave the final go-ahead in a telephone
conversation at 3 a.m. Thursday morning with National Security
Adviser Samuel Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials denied any plan to assassinate bin Laden,
saying that they intended only to damage his network. But asked if
bin Laden was a legitimate military target, Cohen said, ``To the
extent that he and his organization have declared war upon the
United States or our interests, then he certainly is engaged in an
act of war.''

ENTERTAINMENT, REALITY COLLIDE IN STRIKE ON TERRORISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The line between fantasy and reality, between Hollywood and
Washington, has blurred into invisibility in this decade of
cynicism and disillusionment, in this culture of entertainment
above all else. But it snapped clearly back into view Thursday in
the wake of President Clinton's decision to bomb terrorist camps in
Afghanistan and the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   That a Hollywood movie should figure in any discussion of
Thursday's events shows only how skewed our collective sense of
so-called reality has become. One element of Thursday's reaction
consisted of cynical analogies between the US actions and the
political satire ``Wag the Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Wag the Dog,'' Robert De Niro's spin doctor and Dustin
Hoffman's Hollywood producer stage a phony war to divert attention
from a presidential sex scandal. They fill TV screens and
newspapers with faked images of pathos and made-up heroics of a war
America is told is taking place in the Balkans, but in reality is
unfolding on a sound stage. In doing so, they minimize coverage of
the president's peccadilloes.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the splash made by ``Wag the Dog,'' now available on
video, was the fact that it had just gone into wide release when
the Monica Lewinsky story broke in January. Clinton and those who
stand by his actions say the bombings were not politically
motivated, that the current scandal was not the reason for the air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, Senator Dan Coats (R-Ind.) questioned the timing
of the air attacks, given the president's personal difficulties.
Senator Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) seconded him, adding in a milder vein
that the president's problems have to be on the minds of many
people. When special prosecutor Kenneth Starr was asked if he had
seen the movie, he laughed and said he shouldn't comment, but yes,
he had.
</P>
<P>
   Most members of Congress, including the President's severest
critics, closed ranks behind him. And a newly sobered America will
decide how much weight should be given to the skeptical
questioning, how appropriate it is to push the parallel between
fact and fantasy, whether the links between ``Wag the Dog'' and
Thursday's events represent oracular revelation or a conspiracy
theorist's wildest dreams come true.

ARIZONA GOP LAWMAKERS SUPPORT AIR STRIKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER AND ADRIANNE FLYNN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Republican congressmen from Arizona supported
President Clinton's order of air strikes on terrorist targets in
Afghanistan and Sudan, but had different takes on whether the
president's domestic foibles helped prompt the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain predicted most Americans would support
Clinton's move. He rejected the notion that the cruise missile
strikes were designed to distract the public from the Monica
Lewinsky scandal and Clinton's admissions about it earlier in the
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe, and unless confronted with evidence to the
contrary, I am sure, that the president of the United States acted
simply in the United States' national security interests,'' said
McCain, a former Navy pilot and current member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe he would place American lives in danger for
domestic political reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also said he was disturbed that the president did not
consult congressional leaders before the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Although he backed Clinton's move, McCain chided the president
for ``neglecting compelling national security threats'' in the last
seven months, including Saddam Hussein's ejection of U.N. weapons
inspectors from Iraq, a nuclear weapons build-up in North Korea,
the stalled Middle East peace process and the ethnic Albanian
revolt in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he hoped Clinton would address those issues, and
said he doesn't know if the Lewinsky matter was the cause of the
neglect.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can say unequivocally that they have been neglected,''
McCain said, ``and to the detriment of our interests and the
possible future risk in loss of American lives and treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain compared Thursday's ac tion to an attack on terrorists in
Libya in 1986 - a reprisal for a West Berlin bombing that killed
three U.S. servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Libyans have been quieted ever since,'' McCain said. ``I
hope that that will have the same effect on this group of
terrorists, although they are obviously very committed and very
zealous.''
</P>
<P>
   While calling Clinton's action ``fully justified,'' Sen. Jon Kyl
had his own spin on how the timing of the strikes was affected by
allegations that Clinton lied about an affair with Lewinsky while
she was a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Several other senators had said they were suspicious that
Clinton ordered the action to divert attention from his troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If his own political difficulties gave him a little more
courage to do this at this time, then all the better. His actions
have not often been characterized by decisiveness and courage,''
Kyl said. ``Perhaps his own political difficulties screwed that
courage up a bit, but the important thing is he did the right thing
in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyl, chairman of a Senate subcommittee on terrorism, said he was
briefed on the twin strikes just prior to the president's
announcement of the air strike's from Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   During the briefing, Kyl was told of other threats against U.S.
facilities made by the terrorist groups targeted in the attacks,
but he said he could not provide further details.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Kyl were echoed by Republican Rep. Matt Salmon. He
praised the strikes, although he has called for Clinton's
resignation over the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am supportive of this president,'' he said. ``If you commit
acts of terrorism against U.S. citizens, you will be dealt with
harshly.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon said any suggestions of an ulterior motive ``bring out
the worst in us, and I certainly don't want to engage in any such
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anybody that makes accusations of that kind is putting
politics ahead of national security,'' Salmon said. ``It's
irresponsible to be making those kind of accusations. It only harms
our ability to send the right message to terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Rep. J.D. Hayworth, R-Ariz., also supported the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military action we undertook today sends a strong message:
If you attack American citizens, you will pay,'' he said.

 &HT;    CNN coverage faster than a speeding missile
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Less than three hours after the United States launched
Tomahawk missiles against Sudan and Afghanistan, CNN brought up a
live feed from Sudanese television. It appeared to be a ``Larry
King Live''-style talk show, with a guy at a desk taking phone
calls from Sudanese viewers, who ranted against President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a president who has more than 100 girlfriends,'' said a
caller, as a video backdrop showed a building in flames, and
wreckage and rubble in the streets of Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
   What used to be a visionary concept _ the global village _ is
now a given. And we've become used to the speeding-up of the news
cycle, the round-the-clock giddyup mentality that's at the core of
CNN and the Internet, and increasingly the rest of the media.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday was a quantum leap forward, as television whipped
the news along at the speed of a Tomahawk missile. Even during the
Persian Gulf War, it was frequently 24 hours or more before CNN
viewers in America saw what American bombs had done.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the sense of warp-speeding events was driven by TV news,
while for some of it, TV just hung on for the ride. President
Clinton had not even managed the brief flight from his Martha's
Vineyard vacation home back to the White House before Congressional
Republicans were questioning his motives in the timing of the air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   CNN jumped to a live press conference with Sen. Dan Coates
(R-Ind.), who took after Clinton for trying to divert attention
from the Monica Lewinsky scandal. That was right about the time
when Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich called CNN to support the
air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Wag the Dog'' scenario _ named for the fictional movie in
which a president enmeshed in a sex scandal diverts the country
with a fake war _ made it onto TV with frightening swiftness. By my
wristwatch, it was a whopping two minutes after the end of
Clinton's first speech (a brief announcement at 1:55 p.m. at
Martha's Vineyard) that ABC reporter Mike Von Fremde speculated
about a connection between the air strikes and the president's
grand jury testimony and speech Monday in the Monica Lewinsky
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ABC anchor Forrest Sawyer slapped Von Fremde down almost
immediately, saying the comment was ``very unfair. I don't think
Mike meant that.'' (Von Fremde's journalistic sin was not waiting
until Coates and other Republicans put the ``Wag the Dog'' scenario
into play.) Then only a half hour later, an unidentified reporter
at Secretary of Defense William Cohen's press conference asked him
if he had seen the movie and if this was a real-life ``Wag the
Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The smoke is probably still rising on sites that were
targeted, and the motives of the president are being questioned,''
said CNN senior analyst Jeff Greenfield. (Every time Greenfield is
on, it's clear that hiring him away from ABC for his fair and
thoughtful comments is one of the best moves CNN has ever made.)
</P>
<P>
   In a strange contrast, the TV news day on Thursday began like a
different movie, ``Groundhog Day,'' replaying the same sequence
over and over. The scene was of Lewinsky getting out of a car and
stepping into the courthouse in Washington, where she testified
again before Kenneth Starr's grand jury. CNN showed it live shortly
before 9 a.m., then replayed the same Monica-enters-the-building
video snippet seven times in two hours, sometimes in slow-motion.
</P>
<P>
   From slow motion to breakneck speed. There are times when
television is so much the same you want to scream, and times, like
Thursday, when it is extraordinary.

 &HT;    `Wag the Dog' _ Some believe it's a movie whose time has come
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Right in the middle of a press conference discussing
Thursday's U.S. bombing of Afghanistan and Sudan, Defense Secretary
William Cohen was asked about a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Had he seen ``Wag the Dog,'' director Barry Levinson's film
about a fictional spin doctor (Robert De Niro) and a Hollywood
producer (Dustin Hoffman) who stage a mock war to divert America's
attention from a sex scandal involving the president and a young,
female White House visitor?
</P>
<P>
   Cohen was quick to respond. He said the only motivation for
Thursday's maneuvers was ``our absolute obligation to protect the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it ```Wag the Dog' Strikes Back.''
</P>
<P>
   A switchboard operator at Levinson's Baltimore Pictures sounded
harried Thursday afternoon. ``Are you calling for a quote?'' she
asked, adding, ``It's been crazy here.''
</P>
<P>
   The phone had rung all afternoon, with journalists questioning
(once again) the connection between the Hollywood comedy and
Washington politics.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. bombings, coming only three days after President
Clinton's confession of an ``inappropriate relationship'' with
White House intern Monica Lewinsky, may look to some like Hollywood
all over again.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in seven months, the line between show biz
and politics had grown fuzzy. Three weeks after ``Wag'' opened last
December, allegations of Clinton's liaison with former intern
Monica Lewinsky hit the news.
</P>
<P>
   As for the unfortunate parallels between the movie and the
military action, it has struck more than just journalists. ``The
connection did come to mind,'' said Jerry Rubenstein, owner of
Movies Worth Seeing in Atlanta on Thursday afternoon. But that
doesn't mean there was an instant rush on the tape. ``I haven't
seen any response like that, but it may be too early.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, ``Wag the Dog'' probably doesn't need the extra plug.
In video stores since the end of June, this week it ranked No. 6 on
the national list of top tape rentals.

RAUSCHENBERG'S REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH BAKER  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Robert Rauschenberg did not foresee that he
would pose for a photographer in front of his 1954 painting
``Collection'' at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art last
Friday. Yet he happened to wear a sand-colored suit, red silk shirt
and orange tie of the same hues that permeate the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Serendipity has marked equally Rauschenberg's work and his life,
which took him from a poor boyhood in Port Arthur, Texas, to being
a world figure in art, which he became when he got the grand prize
at the 1964 Venice Biennale. His idea that art is reality
reshuffled pervades our cultural landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Rauschenberg was so colorfully dressed, he explained over an
ice-choked glass of wine, because he had lunch with Phyllis Wattis,
the 94-year-old SFMOMA trustee who funded the museum's recent
purchase of more than a dozen early pieces from Rauschenberg's
cache of his own work. His drawl slowly lengthened as the wine
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a 93-year-old mother,'' he said, ``so I know it helps
to wear bright colors so they can see where you are.''
</P>
<P>
   At 72, Rauschenberg himself is no longer the lithe figure who
combined dance, painting and stage design in the '50s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   He moves stiffly now, his posture hunched, his hair mostly gray.
But mischievous energy still flashes in his eyes, his smile and his
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone wonders why Rauschenberg agreed to let SFMOMA acquire
his pivotal early works, including the 22-foot-long ``Automobile
Tire Print'' (1953) and the famous ``Erased de Kooning Drawing''
(1953), a crayon-and-ink drawing that Rauschenberg coaxed from the
abstract expressionist master, then laboriously effaced. Every
modern art museum in the world covets these objects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposal was shocking,'' Rauschenberg admitted. ``At first
I couldn't imagine living without the `Tire Print' or the `Erased
de Kooning.' The anticipation was that they would go to the Museum
of Modern Art in New York. When San Francisco was interested, I had
a little difficulty switching over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason I had assumed that they'd end up in New York
was because most of them were made there, and New York is the
gateway to Europe. But San Francisco is the door to the other half
of the world. I, of all people, should have realized this more
quickly because I've done a lot of work in Japan, in Indonesia, in
China. Yet the only way I could really separate myself from these
things in good conscience was to form a partnership with a museum
to make a continuing in-depth survey of my work.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether that meant that the San Francisco museum would get
other important early works, he sidestepped the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the essence,'' he said of the pieces SFMOMA has just
acquired. They are now traveling with his mammoth retrospective but
will be shown here sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything is going to be more painful to part
with in the future,'' Rauschenberg said. ``Yet I knew rationally
that I wanted them someplace where they could be seen by people. I
didn't want them to be part of somebody else's ego or somebody's
profit. They are not just objects, they are evidence of events.''
</P>
<P>
   Rauschenberg is unfazed by criticism of his retrospective for
being overstuffed. It filled three venues in New York and three in
Houston. It opens in November at the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in
Spain, its final stop.
</P>
<P>
   What bothers him is its air of finality and its emotional toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``De Kooning was very superstitious and refused (New York) MOMA
a retrospective time and time again because he knew too many people
who had died right after theirs,'' Rauschenberg recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm a little superstitious, too, so I just want to get out
of this and recover from it. I'm involved in every aspect of my
retrospective. I have been experiencing emotional fatigue from
having to deliver over and over again moments of my past. I'm
feeling very skittery about the work I'm doing now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the studio, he is currently working with vegetable dye
transfers of computer-enlarged, composite photographs, most of
which he has taken himself.
</P>
<P>
   The most moving aspect of his retrospective, Rauschenberg said,
``is the international appreciation, not of me as a personality,
but of individual objects. This is what I thought of when I started
ROCI'' _ the now-dissolved Rauschenberg Overseas Cultural
Interchange _ ``that images go beyond translation, no matter how
exotic or controversial they are in a given setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Under ROCI, which lasted from 1984 to 1991, Rauschenberg and his
assistants traveled around the world at his expense, collaborating
with artists and craftsmen largely in countries where democracy was
still a distant prospect. Whatever these travels did for artists
elsewhere, they netted Rauschenberg a lot of new work and some
criticism that he was grandstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``ROCI was dissolved when I ran out of money,'' he said. ``I had
to sell my Twomblys, my Johnses, my Warhols, and I ran out of
people to buy my Rauschenbergs. But ROCI still echoes around the
world. In Beijing, if somebody says they're an artist, they ask,
`Pre-Rauschenberg or post-?' Same thing in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (MORE) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Rauschenberg continues to fund Change Inc., a foundation that
helps artists with small sums for non-art needs such as emergency
medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Rauschenberg retrospective's tour has not been untroubled.
The day it opened in Houston, police seized several important
pieces, including a couple purchased by SFMOMA, as a lien against
damages awarded to two Austin, Texas, art consultants who sued the
artist and two of his representatives for breach of contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not supposed to talk about that,'' Rauschenberg said.
``Legally, we have what's called an amicable resolution. The works
were back on the wall the next day. It's the first time I've had
all the press on my side. I can't say it was worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rauschenberg acknowledges seeing his artistic influence
everywhere, but he thinks that critics misrepresent things when
they place him in confrontation with the generation before him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't working against anything,'' he said of his early
career. ``People tried to insist that Jasper Johns and I did the
kind of work we did because we were against abstract expressionism.
But I used Vermeer, Leonardo, Ben Shahn, anything in history. If
you need it, it's what you do. I've never accepted the aesthetic
limitation of doing something to the exclusion of something else.
That's negative, there's no energy there. I just backed off from
abstract expressionism because they had their space and I didn't
feel at home in it, even though I didn't have a home.''
</P>
<P>
   The current critical fashion is to discover ``gay content'' in
Rauschenberg's early work that could not be acknowledged openly in
the '50s. The most famous example is Robert Hughes' reading of
Rauschenberg's ``Monogram'' (1955-59), a painted canvas on its
back, surmounted by a stuffed Angora goat with an old tire around
its midriff.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one asks why it became so famous,'' Hughes writes of
``Monogram,'' ``the answer can only lie in its power ... as a
sexual fetish. The lust of the goat, as William Blake remarked, is
the glory of God; and this one, halfway through the tire, is an
image of anal sex, the satyr in the sphincter.''
</P>
<P>
   After Rauschenberg read this, he recalled, ``I ran into Hughes
on the street, and said, `If you feel that way about auto tires, I
don't know how you live in New York. How do you cross a street?'''
</P>
<P>
   Interpretation ``just gets carried too far,'' Rauschenberg
complained. ``With the concepts of Freudian sexual symbolism and so
forth, you almost can't look at anything for what it is. I find
myself inhibited by trying avoid symbolism that really isn't in the
picture. If I wanted a penis in a picture, I'd put a penis in a
picture. I don't leave anything to the imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   The current project that excites Rauschenberg most is a
commission from the Vatican to decorate a cathedral designed by
Renzo Piano, a shrine to the Franciscan healer Padre Pio, who is
soon to be canonized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having to go back to working on silk,'' Rauschenberg said,
``because of the requirements of the space _ 150 feet wide by 45
feet high. They are insistent that the piece be reverent of Padre
Pio's healing work, but the first assignment I've got is the
Apocalypse, which is a natural for me, but not a natural for
healing. Frankly, I'm having trouble with the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in Rome recently, I made a trip to the Vatican and
checked out the competition and thought, `That's not it.'''
</P>
<P>
   He is still struggling with the details. ``It has to be done a
week before the year 2000.''

 &HT;    Online global voices expand debate, news
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Americans glued to CNN, MSNBC or ABCNews.com can get
another perspective on the cruise missile strikes by visiting
international news and information Web sites and chat areas.
</P>
<P>
   Here, it's possible to get a glimpse of how the United States
and its foreign policy are perceived around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the English-language information is a few days old, but
it provides insight on American relations with Sudan and
Afghanistan before Thursday's strikes.
</P>
<P>
   An interview with Osama bin Laden, whose network was the target
of the strikes, appears on the Web site of the fundamentalist
Islamic Azzam Publications, http://www.
</P>
<P>
   webstorage.com/(tilde)azzam/html/.usamahbinladin.html). The site
is devoted to advancing the cause of Islamic holy war. Other
articles talk about fragile relations between the United States and
Afghanistan before the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Real-time chats are another way to gauge world reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise, shock and stunned amazement were the Islamic world's
online reactions to the U.S. attacks on Sudan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are American acts not terrorist when they kill civilians
in Iraq or anyplace else?'' asked one chat participant in a
Muslim-oriented chat room sponsored by Taliban Online.
</P>
<P>
   Taliban Online, http://www.taliban.com, the English-language Web
site of the controversial fundamentalist group, had a small but
passionate group discussion about the action and U.S. foreign
policy in general.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation was not a unilateral call for a jihad or
terrorist acts against the United States. Rather, it was a
thoughtful discussion of how the Islamic world should respond to
U.S. foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has become clear that terrorism is a U.S. policy,''
said one chat room participant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe (terrorism) is the only language they will understand,''
said another.
</P>
<P>
   The few Americans in the chat room seemed as puzzled as their
international counterparts about the motivation behind the strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Some Afghans living abroad reported news they had received from
their families at home. One participant claimed 900 civilians were
killed. Another simply logged on to say none of their family
members was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The participants in the Taliban chat were primarily Europeans,
Afghans or Pakistanis living abroad.
</P>
<P>
   There were some tense moments when one American entered into a
heated debate with another chat room member.
</P>
<P>
   ``It matters that brothers allow the slaughter of other
brothers, and that should not be allowed,'' said one.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you support killing Americans, but not Muslims?'' asked
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, the participants in this chat spent more
time wondering what motivated the attacks than how or when to
retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   Most chat room members were interested in discussing peace
rather than war. Much of the discussion centered around whether the
United States or any nation could solve anything through terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no justification for what the U.S. or any nation is
doing,'' said one person.
</P>
<P>
   Added another, ``Somebody has to break the circle of violence.''

 &HT;    Strikes may be 'hard sale' for Clinton, given his political
troubles
 &HT;    By Steve Visser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ President Clinton's decision to strike back at
terrorists came on the best or worst of weeks depending on whether
the public sees it as a cynical move to divert attention from his
scandals or rallies behind the president to lift him up and keep
him there.
</P>
<P>
   It all depends on whether the public and the politicians find
the president is credible enough to be believed when it comes to
making life-and-death decisions. That's not necessarily a given
with a national leader who misled the nation for seven months after
looking it in the eye and denying having a relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president does have a harder sale than say Jimmy Carter
who told the American people `I would never lie to you,''' said
Charles Bullock, a political scientist with the University of
Georgia. ``The big problem with this current event is that it's the
script of ``Wag the Dog.'' History repeats art.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, ``Wag the Dog,'' a president and his advisers
divert attention from his sex scandal by staging a phony war.
William Schneider, a political analyst with CNN and the American
Enterprise Institute, thought the attack was perfectly timed in
terms of Clinton's political troubles. The president's Monday night
address about the Lewinsky affair had been vehemently attacked in
editorial and political circles and seemed to fuel the train headed
to wreck his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The momentum was building to disable his presidency,'' said
Schneider, who said he wasn't suggesting Clinton attacked for those
reasons. ``This action nipped it in the bud. He lucked out. He now
gets a second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Emory University's Merle Black said that the attacks would
undoubtedly face greater public scrutiny because of the natural
suspicion that Clinton was using cruise missiles to boost his
public standing and derail Special Prosecutor Ken Starr's train.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that in misleading the public in the Lewinsky affair,
Clinton had undermined his credibility with the public, and it was
critical that he restore it if he was to act effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has an opportunity here to reassert leadership and the
public approval of his leadership is his strongest asset,'' Black
said. ``His motives will be suspect .... I think that is very
harmful to a president, especially where lives are at risk. He
needs to have a very convincing rationale about why he felt it
necessary to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Schwartz, a historian specializing in foreign policy at
Vanderbilt University, said it's not unusual for the public to
suspect ulterior motives in military ventures when presidents are
under attack domestically.
</P>
<P>
   He said there were suspicions that President Reagan's decision
to invade Grenada in 1983 was to divert attention from the bombing
of the Marine barracks in Lebanon and the failed policy there.
President Nixon faced similar suspicions during the Watergate
investigation when he ordered a nuclear alert to thwart plans by
the Soviet Union to intervene in the Yom Kippur War in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The historian said that Clinton may have felt pressured to act
decisively because of fears that America's enemies might think him
so weakened they could challenge US interests abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can always expect accusations,'' he said. ``In a way its
both true and irrelevant. It's true that a president under attack
will appear weak and is under pressure to do something dramatic
abroad. And it's important that he appear strong abroad.''

US BLASTS TERRORIST TARGETS IN AFGHANISTAN, SUDAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ US forces launched a pair of night missile attacks
Thursday on what officials described as a ``terrorist university''
in the hills of Afghanistan and a terrorist-sponsored chemical
plant in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes were in direct retaliation for the bombings of two
US embassies in Africa two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The action came as US intelligence officials reported that key
terrorist leaders from across the region planned to gather Thursday
at the Afghanistan training facility, considered a preeminent
terrorist matrix in the world. It also followed intelligence gained
by US officials anticipating a fresh round of terrorist attacks on
American targets, possibly more overseas embassies.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton gave final orders for the attacks around dawn
Thursday from his borrowed vacation compound on Martha's Vineyard,
made a hasty announcement in Edgartown, Mass., on the island, early
Thursday afternoon, then rushed back to Washington for meetings in
the White House situation room to deliver an Oval Office address.
The operation had been planned in secret in the prior two weeks,
senior officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we have struck back,'' Clinton said in the makeshift
briefing room at the Edgartown School before he left. He added:
``Terrorists must have no doubt that in the face of their threats,
America will protect its citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   From the Oval Office, Clinton said, ``Let our actions today send
this message loud and clear: There are no expendable American
targets. There will be no sanctuary for terrorists. We will defend
our people, our interests and our values.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton spoke from Martha's Vineyard and shuttled back to the
White House, former intern Monica Lewinsky appeared again before
the federal grand jury investigating her relationship with the
president -- in a stark contrast that prompted two Republican
senators, Dan Coats of Indiana and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania,
to openly question Clinton's motives in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an obvious issue here of whether there were any
diversionary motives involved,'' said Specter.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican and Democratic leaders, who had been kept
apprised of the plans by White House national security officials,
offered universal and strong support for the operation, as is
customary in the wake of US military strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US did exactly the right thing,'' said House Speaker Newt
Gingrich. ``We cannot allow a terrorist group to attack US
embassies and do nothing. We cannot afford to have people think
they can kill Americans without any consequence. This was exactly
the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the timing of the strikes, Secretary of Defense
William Cohen said, ``The only motivation driving this action today
was our absolute obligation to protect the American people from
terrorist activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the US targeted terrorist operations and sites
financed by Osama bin Laden, a multimillionaire Saudi exile who has
openly declared war on the United States and is the main suspect in
the twin embassy bombings in the capitals of Tanzania and Kenya on
August 7 -- attacks in which a dozen Americans and over 200
Africans were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's strikes, using Tomahawk cruise missiles with 1,000
pound warheads launched from ships in the Red and Arabian seas,
were aimed against a sprawling paramilitary training center in
Afghanistan operated and funded by bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   The second target was the Shifa Pharmaceutical plant in Sudan's
capital city of Khartoum. The facililty is suspected of making the
chemical agent used in the production of a deadly nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know with great certainty it produces the penultimate
chemical that goes into VX nerve gas,'' said Samuel (Sandy) Berger,
Clinton's national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The first missiles rained down at about 1:30 p.m. EDT, which is
7:30 p.m. in Sudan and 10 p.m. in Afghanistan. The attacks
continued for about an hour, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Sudanese television footage showed the Shifa plant engulfed in
flames, with significant damage. Bloodied men were carried out on
stretchers, though there was no definitive estimate of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they intentionally bombed the
plant, located in an industrial complex, in the evening in order to
minimize casulualties among workers.
</P>
<P>
   US officials said they are uncertain how much damage the
missiles caused at the Afghanistan training sites, which included a
storage facility, a weapons training center, administrative offices
and housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``These bases provide refuges for terrorists and train
terrorists for tactics and use of international weapons,'' said
General Hugh Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how many terrorists, if any, were killed in the
raids, which were launched under the cover of darkness. US
officials stopped short of declaring the mission a success, and
they admitted they did not know if bin Laden had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no idea of bin Laden's whereabouts or whether he was
in the camp at that time,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Taliban, the ruling party of Afghanistan,
said bin Laden was not at the site at the time and was not killed.
After the attacks, the FBI immediately warned all local law
enforcement agencies to be on a heightened level of alert for
possible terrorist retaliation on US soil. Embassy officials abroad
were also warned, as were US travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, most US diplomats and their families fled the
embassy in Pakistan out of a fear for another embassy bombing. This
move came as US officials gathered key intelligence data that
showed more attacks were planned in the terrorist world, officials
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The operation was executed with such extraordinary secrecy that
no US troops or ships were moved in the attack for fear of calling
attention to the plan. Also, no senior US national security
officials traveled to Martha's Vineyard this week to meet Clinton
so as not to alert news reporters covering the president.

 &HT;      REPUBLICANS SAY WAR ON TERRORISM IS JUST BEGINNING; 
 &HT;      DISPUTE ``WAG-THE-DOG'' ANALOGY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, August 20 -- The American war on terrorism is just
beginning, according to Congressional Republican leaders, and
despite distinct similarities between the Thursday's bombing of
suspected terrorist bases and a recent Hollywood movie, leading
Republicans defended President Clinton's motives and actions.
</P>
<P>
   On a conference call to update Republican congressmen about U.S.
military action in Afghanistan and Sudan, House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Porter
J. Goss, R-Fla., said they were briefed and consulted about ``every
level of detail'' for the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a very dirty, very nasty little war on
terrorism ongoing for some time, but it is clear it has
escalated,'' Goss said. ``We are having a war and people need to be
behind it and support the president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a long campaign -- six months, two years, three
years -- and there will be casualties,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   Goss said public officials must stress the ``nature of
ugliness'' of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't care about suicide. They don't care about the
targets they take. They would prefer to attack softer targets like
women and children because it is easier,'' Goss warned. ``We need
to remind the American people that this will be ongoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and Goss went out of their way to dispute the notion
that President Clinton used Thursday's strikes to distract
attention from the grand jury investigation into his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was driven entirely by national security considerations,''
Gingrich said firmly. ``If you saw the television coverage of the
embassy bombings, if you saw the caskets coming home, you know this
is real. ... There should be no question by anyone that this is
being exploited in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said he is ``very comfortable with the planning'' that
went into the American retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was approached by the Clinton administration (about
retaliatory action) on the day of the bombings in Africa,''
Gingrich said. ``I have been briefed on every level of detail. I
felt, at all times, that I had input.''
</P>
<P>
   Goss added that the administration ``has been very faithful in
keeping us appraised'' since the attacks on the American embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania last week.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican Conference Chairman John A. Boehner, R-Ohio,
organized and hosted the briefing. Gingrich estimated that more
than 100 Republicans listened in.

DISNEY PULLS A POWER PLAY

By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Disney, about to make the NHL officials the
happiest guys on Earth, should find out any day now that its
preposterous decision to throw $600 million at the league so it can
retain full custody of the TV rights starting with the 1999-2000
season has been approved.
</P>
<P>
   As a bonus _ or is it a curse? _ it'll probably come
gift-wrapped with the '98-'99 season as well.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline passed a week ago for incumbent NHL rights-holder
Fox to match Disney's offer (all it has to do is agree to pay 90
percent of the offer).
</P>
<P>
   Fox might be crazy, but it isn't stupid. The network hasn't
officially passed, but consider it a pocket veto.
</P>
<P>
   The delay in the announcement is caused by Fox's attempt to hit
the dump button on the $45 million final year of its five-year,
$155 million deal. Fox has lost about $12 million on last season
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Rupert Murdoch knows all about overpaying for sports TV rights
if it means establishing a hold on something worthwhile. A few
years ago, Murdoch's troops were convinced the NHL could be the
sport of the '90s _ they even went so far as to approve a
glowing-blue puck.
</P>
<P>
   But then those pesky ratings showed _ again _ that a national
package of games, even if sold to viewers as regional broadcasts,
aren't worth more than a bunch of shaved ice. Might as well show

   Disney's desired need to spend $350 million for the NHL as a
staple to ESPN and ESPN2 programming (in addition to a $250 million

Sunday afternoons in mid-winter. Fox already has what it wants from
the NHL _ regional team coverage on the Fox Sports Net (with 19 of
the 20 teams in the U.S.). Fox will gladly give Disney the package
and laugh out loud as it pays three times what Fox feels the deal
is worth.

   VX, the chemical nerve agent that the administration alleges
Sudan was preparing to make, is one of the deadliest nerve agents
known to man, especially when applied to the skin. A 10 milligram
drop on the skin can kill an adult human in 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   An organophosphate that is chemically related to certain
insecticides, VX interferes with the ability of nerves to
regenerate themselves and to fire again. It causes loss of muscle
control, convulsive seizures, respiratory paralysis and almost
certain death.
</P>
<P>
   Synthesized by British scientists who were searching for new
insecticides after World War II, VX can contaminate an area for
days. It is said to be a thousand times more potent than the nerve
agent sarin. U.S. Chemical Corp. announced in its annual report
after VX was standardized in 1957, ``The reign of mustard gas,
which has been called the King of Battle Gases since it was first
used in July 1917, will probably come to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen said in a press conference
Thursday that the administration had bombed the Shifa Chemical
Complex in Northeast Khartoum in the Sudan because the intelligence
community was ``confident'' that the plant was ``involved in the
production of chemical weapons agents, including precursor
chemicals for deadly V-series of nerve agents, like, for example,
VX.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Tucker, director of the Chemical and Biological Weapons
nonproliferation project at the Monterey Institute of International
Studies, said that there were three likely possibilities for those
agents: the main precursors phosphorous trichloride or phosphorous
pentasulfide, both of which are used in the production of certain
pesticides, and another important ingredient, diisopropyl
ethylamine.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pesticide plant could be used as a cover for a nerve agent
production facility, although the production equipment would have
to be modified,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1961 to 1968, the United States produced large
quantities of VX, and currently has roughly 4500 tons in its
weapons stockpile. The Soviet Union produced at least that much of
a similar agent called V-gas, and also has vast stockpiles. But
both countries have ratified the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention,
which requires complete destruction of all such stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries, however, are suspected of having VX, among them
Iran and Syria. Recent inspections by the U.N. Special Commission
charged with disarming Iraq have revealed that Baghdad produced
large quantities of VX and filled it into SCUD missile warheads.
Iraq has acknowledged that it once had sufficient precursor
chemicals to make nearly 500 tons of VX, but claims that all its VX
stocks have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said that Osama Bin Laden, the
Saudi-born financier, has been working with the Islamic militant
government in Sudan since 1995 to develop and buy dual use
equipment that can be used to produce VX and other weapons of mass
destruction. Specifically, they said, Bin Laden had been working
with the militant Islamic government in Khartoum to improve Sudan's
chemical capabilities in what the Sudanese call its
``military-industrial complex,'' part of which is said to include
the chemical plant bombed Thursday. According to a February report
published by the House of Representatives' Task Force on Terrorism
&AMP; Unconventional Warfare, Iraq has also provided assistance to
Sudan's covert program to develop chemical weapons, a charge that
the Khartoum government has denied. Specifically, the task force
report charges that Iraq in 1995 helped Sudan build a chemical
weapons plant in Wau, in south-western Sudan, as well as a gas
storage site. Sudanese opposition groups have also charged that
Sudan used Iraqi mustard gas which it has stored since the Gulf war
against rebels, who have been fighting a protracted war against the
Islamic government in Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
   General Wafiq al-Sammarai, former head of Iraqi Military
Intelligence, who defected to the West in 1994, has charged that
Iraq actually used VX gas against Iranian soldiers in the battle of
Fao, one of the fiercest battles in the Iran-Iraq war in 1988. That
allegation has not been confirmed, and experts agree that VX has
only rarely been used.
</P>
<P>
   The only terrorist group known to have used VX is Aum Shinrikyo,
the Japanese cult which staged the attack on the Tokyo subway.
Japanese prosecutors in 1996 charged cult leaders with using VX,
which the cult's guru called a `divine power,'' to kill cult
critics in late 1994 and 1995.

 &HT;      REPUBLICANS SAY WAR ON TERRORISM IS JUST BEGINNING; 
 &HT;      DISPUTE ``WAG-THE-DOG'' ANALOGY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, August 20 -- The American war on terrorism is just
beginning, according to Congressional Republican leaders, and
despite distinct similarities between the Thursday's bombing of
suspected terrorist bases and a recent Hollywood movie, leading
Republicans defended President Clinton's motives and actions.
</P>
<P>
   On a conference call to update Republican congressmen about U.S.
military action in Afghanistan and Sudan, House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Porter
J. Goss, R-Fla., said they were briefed and consulted about ``every
level of detail'' for the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a very dirty, very nasty little war on
terrorism ongoing for some time, but it is clear it has
escalated,'' Goss said. ``We are having a war and people need to be
behind it and support the president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a long campaign -- six months, two years, three
years -- and there will be casualties,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   Goss said public officials must stress the ``nature of
ugliness'' of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't care about suicide. They don't care about the
targets they take. They would prefer to attack softer targets like
women and children because it is easier,'' Goss warned. ``We need
to remind the American people that this will be ongoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and Goss went out of their way to dispute the notion
that President Clinton used Thursday's strikes to distract
attention from the grand jury investigation into his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was driven entirely by national security considerations,''
Gingrich said firmly. ``If you saw the television coverage of the
embassy bombings, if you saw the caskets coming home, you know this
is real. ... There should be no question by anyone that this is
being exploited in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said he is ``very comfortable with the planning'' that
went into the American retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was approached by the Clinton administration (about
retaliatory action) on the day of the bombings in Africa,''
Gingrich said. ``I have been briefed on every level of detail. I
felt, at all times, that I had input.''
</P>
<P>
   Goss added that the administration ``has been very faithful in
keeping us appraised'' since the attacks on the American embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania last week.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican Conference Chairman John A. Boehner, R-Ohio,
organized and hosted the briefing. Gingrich estimated that more
than 100 Republicans listened in.

SOME QUESTION TIMING OF ATTACK, SEE SIMILARITIES TO `WAG THE DOG' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ The eerie similarities struck 16-year-old
Brad Chaffee immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night he and his vacationing family watched a video of
``Wag the Dog,'' the movie about a president embroiled in a sex
scandal who stages a phony war to distract the public.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon Chaffee stood in an elementary school
gymnasium watching President Clinton, embroiled in a sex scandal,
announce the bombing of suspected terrorist sites in Afghanistan
and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walks in here after he announces the scandals and he says
we're attacking a terrorist base,'' an excited Chaffee said. ``It
parallels the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager wasn't the only one to notice the connection
between President Clinton's personal crisis and an international
crisis and wonder about the timing and its impact. And the
administration found itself having to answer questions about the
motivation for its military action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only motivation driving this action today was our absolute
obligation to protect the American people from terrorist
activities. That is the sole motivation. No other consideration has
been involved,'' said Defense Secretary William Cohen, a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, military action generates public support for
presidents,
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that at this point we rally around the president
unless we have reasons not to. We have to assume the president of
the United States, the secretary of defense, the chairman of the
joint chiefs of staff, the director of the FBI are acting in our
interests,'' said Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at the
Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have room to get cynical later if for any reason we learn
things that we don't now know,'' Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   The president made a surprise appearance before reporters here
just hours after Monica Lewinsky resumed her testimony before a
Washington grand jury, providing more details about her 18-month
affair with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   His announcement of the U.S. retaliation came just as Clinton
appeared to hit his own political nadir. Politicians and pundits
panned his address to the nation Monday night in which he admitted
to an ``inappropriate relationship'' and expressed regret, but did
not say he was sorry. The president's job approval ratings have
remained strong in public opinion surveys this week, but his
personal standing has fallen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (White House) political types did not have a clue (about
the impending bombing). This whole operation was out of
Washington,'' said a senior aide traveling with the president.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official said, ``I think the merits of the
issue and the need to go in speak for themselves. The facts will
stand on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Republican leadership voiced strong support for the
decision strike back at the terrorists, others were not as
generous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the timing here is extraordinary,'' said Sen. Daniel
Coats, R-Ind. ``The reaction of the president is so
uncharacteristic of anything he has done in his six years of a
presidency that it raises legitimate questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., noted the U.S. retaliation came the
same day of news reports that the White House staff was attempting
to refocus attention away from Clinton's personal problems and onto
his presidential duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an obvious question that will be raised
internationally ... as to whether there is any diversionary motive
involved,'' Specter said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Judiciary
Committee and a leading critic of Clinton on the Lewinsky affair,
voiced support for Clinton's decision and urged others to do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to applaud the president. I want to give him credit for
being willing to take this action at this time,'' Hatch said.
Earlier this week, Hatch called Clinton ``a jerk'' for criticizing
independent counsel Kenneth Starr during the president's address to
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement gave the vacationing president the opportunity
to take full advantage of his presidential trappings.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCurry, the White House spokesman, had just began a daily
press briefing at the Edgartown School gym, describing the coconut
birthday cake and the blue sweater the president received for his
52nd birthday Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The press pool that always follows the president had just
settled under a white tent at the edge of the estate where the
Clintons are vacationing and ordered a pay-per-view movie from the
satellite hook-up.
</P>
<P>
   The movie? ``Wag the Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Unbeknownst to reporters at the school, McCurry was killing
time. He received first a paged message and then a note that
Clinton had left the estate, cueing him to inform reporters that
the president would be in the filing center in 10 minutes to make a
national security announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton swept into the area that also included the Chaffee
family, who came just to glimpse the White House press corps and
McCurry in action. The president dramatically announced the U.S.
military action and that he was interrupting his vacation to return
to the White House for a national security briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger, the national security adviser, said
``operational secrecy'' made it imperative that none of Clinton's
foreign policy team be seen on Martha's Vineyard, an island off the
Massachusetts coast.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three hours later, Clinton made a nationwide address from
the Oval Office to explain the reasons behind his action.

PATRIOTS SIGN JOHNSON TO 5-YEAR, $25 MILLION DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ With each new signing, NFL owners seem to
move one step closer to the guaranteed problems that plague Major
League Baseball and the NBA. Thursday the Patriots inched pro
football nearer to the kind of guaranteed contracts that have made
NBA and MLB players all but unmanageable. They signed middle
linebacker Ted Johnson to a five-year, $25 million contract
extension that includes $8 million in guaranteed bonuses and an
option that all but weds the team to him until 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The total deal is worth $25.4 million because it includes the
$403,000 salary Johnson was already contracted to receive this
season. It also includes a two-tiered signing bonus in which he
receives $3 million immediately and another $5 million next year,
when the extension kicks in.
</P>
<P>
   That bit of creative accounting allowed the Patriots to offer
Johnson the kind of money he and agent Jack Mills were seeking and
stay under the salary cap. The Patriots now can prorate the value
of the $3 million bonus over six years ($500,000 in cap value per
season) and the additional $5 million over five years (an added cap
value of $1 million a year beginning in 1999), a feature that made
the deal cap-friendly for the team.
</P>
<P>
   Those concessions were helpful for the Patriots, who still hope
to sign cornerback Ty Law before he becomes a free agent next
February. But to get them, New England had to agree to a deal
structure that makes it virtually impossible to release Johnson
before the end of the contract because of the acceleration onto the
cap of the bonus money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically a two-year deal with an option for four more
years, but the economics are such that they can't afford not to
extend,'' Mills explained. Thursday ``If they don't exercise the
option, they have to buy out the rest of the contract. It wouldn't
make sense to pay us $5 million to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, this contract is pretty high as far as guaranteed
money goes. We have more guaranteed money than (Levon) Kirkland
(the Pittsburgh Steelers' All-Pro linebacker, who has $4.8 million
of his $28 million deal guaranteed, according to Mills). You still
don't see many guaranteed deals out there. The preferred way by NFL
owners is to guarantee bonuses, but the higher the bonus you get,
the more cap money on the books if they try to release the player.
It's a built-in protection.''
</P>
<P>
   If New England fails to exercise the option, it would take a $5
million hit on its cap next season, a figure it would be virtually
impossible to absorb and still keep players like Law, safety Lawyer
Milloy, and center Dave Wohlabaugh. Hence the belief that for all
intents and purposes, Johnson, a fourth-year veteran, now has a
contract that will pay him into his ninth professional season and
possibly beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted is very likely to collect all this money, and it could be
more,'' Mills said. ``If he's in prime time, I'd expect they'd come
and renegotiate it at some point. If he's still playing well, I
don't think they'll want him to become a free agent in his ninth
year.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, it would be a financial moot point because Johnson
would be set for life, even if his play had begun to slip, as did
that of his predecessor, Vincent Brown, once knee injuries plagued
him. While the Patriots could probably swallow letting Johnson go
with a year remaining on the deal if neccessary, anything more than
that seems problematic, a problem similar to what Mills said the
Dallas Cowboys now face with running back Emmitt Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do that, you've got to be prepared to take a pretty big hit
on your cap,'' Mills said. ``That's the situation the Cowboys find
themselves in. They thought they were being really creative. Now
they're seeing they can't afford to let Emmitt go. It could blow
your cap apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, both Johnson and the Patriots believe this is not a
concern. It is their shared belief that he is just beginning to
emerge as one of the AFC's top inside linebackers after leading the
team in tackles the past two saeason and being named a Pro Bowl
alternate a year ago. Barring injury, they believe they are on safe
ground with the 25-year-old Johnson despite the guaranteed nature
of his newly signed deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``A while back, when these discussions came up, I supported this
move all the way,'' said Patriots coach Pete Carroll. ``We were
real strong about it. There was no doubt what we wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a clear statement that we're making an investment with
people of his character who stand for everything we believe is
important. We can see where he's going. He's becoming a master at
his position.''
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson does, his contract will be a bargain down the road.
If he doesn't, it could become an albatross. That is the gamble NFL
owners are now taking more and more as they sign young athletes to
contracts that are not guaranteed by law but are fully guaranteed
by the league's new accounting process.

   VX, the chemical nerve agent that the administration alleges
Sudan was preparing to make, is one of the deadliest nerve agents
known to man, especially when applied to the skin. A 10 milligram
drop on the skin can kill an adult human in 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   An organophosphate that is chemically related to certain
insecticides, VX interferes with the ability of nerves to
regenerate themselves and to fire again. It causes loss of muscle
control, convulsive seizures, respiratory paralysis and almost
certain death.
</P>
<P>
   Synthesized by British scientists who were searching for new
insecticides after World War II, VX can contaminate an area for
days. It is said to be a thousand times more potent than the nerve
agent sarin. U.S. Chemical Corp. announced in its annual report
after VX was standardized in 1957, ``The reign of mustard gas,
which has been called the King of Battle Gases since it was first
used in July 1917, will probably come to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen said in a press conference
Thursday that the administration had bombed the Shifa Chemical
Complex in Northeast Khartoum in the Sudan because the intelligence
community was ``confident'' that the plant was ``involved in the
production of chemical weapons agents, including precursor
chemicals for deadly V-series of nerve agents, like, for example,
VX.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Tucker, director of the Chemical and Biological Weapons
nonproliferation project at the Monterey Institute of International
Studies, said that there were three likely possibilities for those
agents: the main precursors phosphorous trichloride or phosphorous
pentasulfide, both of which are used in the production of certain
pesticides, and another important ingredient, diisopropyl
ethylamine.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pesticide plant could be used as a cover for a nerve agent
production facility, although the production equipment would have
to be modified,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1961 to 1968, the United States produced large
quantities of VX, and currently has roughly 4500 tons in its
weapons stockpile. The Soviet Union produced at least that much of
a similar agent called V-gas, and also has vast stockpiles. But
both countries have ratified the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention,
which requires complete destruction of all such stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries, however, are suspected of having VX, among them
Iran and Syria. Recent inspections by the U.N. Special Commission
charged with disarming Iraq have revealed that Baghdad produced
large quantities of VX and filled it into SCUD missile warheads.
Iraq has acknowledged that it once had sufficient precursor
chemicals to make nearly 500 tons of VX, but claims that all its VX
stocks have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said that Osama Bin Laden, the
Saudi-born financier, has been working with the Islamic militant
government in Sudan since 1995 to develop and buy dual use
equipment that can be used to produce VX and other weapons of mass
destruction. Specifically, they said, Bin Laden had been working
with the militant Islamic government in Khartoum to improve Sudan's
chemical capabilities in what the Sudanese call its
``military-industrial complex,'' part of which is said to include
the chemical plant bombed Thursday. According to a February report
published by the House of Representatives' Task Force on Terrorism
&AMP; Unconventional Warfare, Iraq has also provided assistance to
Sudan's covert program to develop chemical weapons, a charge that
the Khartoum government has denied. Specifically, the task force
report charges that Iraq in 1995 helped Sudan build a chemical
weapons plant in Wau, in south-western Sudan, as well as a gas
storage site. Sudanese opposition groups have also charged that
Sudan used Iraqi mustard gas which it has stored since the Gulf war
against rebels, who have been fighting a protracted war against the
Islamic government in Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
   General Wafiq al-Sammarai, former head of Iraqi Military
Intelligence, who defected to the West in 1994, has charged that
Iraq actually used VX gas against Iranian soldiers in the battle of
Fao, one of the fiercest battles in the Iran-Iraq war in 1988. That
allegation has not been confirmed, and experts agree that VX has
only rarely been used.
</P>
<P>
   The only terrorist group known to have used VX is Aum Shinrikyo,
the Japanese cult which staged the attack on the Tokyo subway.
Japanese prosecutors in 1996 charged cult leaders with using VX,
which the cult's guru called a `divine power,'' to kill cult
critics in late 1994 and 1995.

US BLASTS TERRORIST TARGETS IN AFGHANISTAN, SUDAN

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ US forces launched a pair of night missile attacks
Thursday on what officials described as a ``terrorist university''
in the hills of Afghanistan and a terrorist-sponsored chemical
plant in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes were in direct retaliation for the bombings of two
US embassies in Africa two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The action came as US intelligence officials reported that key
terrorist leaders from across the region planned to gather Thursday
at the Afghanistan training facility, considered a preeminent
terrorist matrix in the world. It also followed intelligence gained
by US officials anticipating a fresh round of terrorist attacks on
American targets, possibly more overseas embassies.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton gave final orders for the attacks around dawn
Thursday from his borrowed vacation compound on Martha's Vineyard,
made a hasty announcement in Edgartown, Mass., on the island, early
Thursday afternoon, then rushed back to Washington for meetings in
the White House situation room to deliver an Oval Office address.
The operation had been planned in secret in the prior two weeks,
senior officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we have struck back,'' Clinton said in the makeshift
briefing room at the Edgartown School before he left. He added:
``Terrorists must have no doubt that in the face of their threats,
America will protect its citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   From the Oval Office, Clinton said, ``Let our actions today send
this message loud and clear: There are no expendable American
targets. There will be no sanctuary for terrorists. We will defend
our people, our interests and our values.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton spoke from Martha's Vineyard and shuttled back to the
White House, former intern Monica Lewinsky appeared again before
the federal grand jury investigating her relationship with the
president -- in a stark contrast that prompted two Republican
senators, Dan Coats of Indiana and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania,
to openly question Clinton's motives in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an obvious issue here of whether there were any
diversionary motives involved,'' said Specter.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican and Democratic leaders, who had been kept
apprised of the plans by White House national security officials,
offered universal and strong support for the operation, as is
customary in the wake of US military strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US did exactly the right thing,'' said House Speaker Newt
Gingrich. ``We cannot allow a terrorist group to attack US
embassies and do nothing. We cannot afford to have people think
they can kill Americans without any consequence. This was exactly
the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the timing of the strikes, Secretary of Defense
William Cohen said, ``The only motivation driving this action today
was our absolute obligation to protect the American people from
terrorist activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the US targeted terrorist operations and sites
financed by Osama bin Laden, a multimillionaire Saudi exile who has
openly declared war on the United States and is the main suspect in
the twin embassy bombings in the capitals of Tanzania and Kenya on
August 7 -- attacks in which a dozen Americans and over 200
Africans were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's strikes, using Tomahawk cruise missiles with 1,000
pound warheads launched from ships in the Red and Arabian seas,
were aimed against a sprawling paramilitary training center in
Afghanistan operated and funded by bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   The second target was the Shifa Pharmaceutical plant in Sudan's
capital city of Khartoum. The facililty is suspected of making the
chemical agent used in the production of a deadly nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know with great certainty it produces the penultimate
chemical that goes into VX nerve gas,'' said Samuel (Sandy) Berger,
Clinton's national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The first missiles rained down at about 1:30 p.m. EDT, which is
7:30 p.m. in Sudan and 10 p.m. in Afghanistan. The attacks
continued for about an hour, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Sudanese television footage showed the Shifa plant engulfed in
flames, with significant damage. Bloodied men were carried out on
stretchers, though there was no definitive estimate of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they intentionally bombed the
plant, located in an industrial complex, in the evening in order to
minimize casulualties among workers.
</P>
<P>
   US officials said they are uncertain how much damage the
missiles caused at the Afghanistan training sites, which included a
storage facility, a weapons training center, administrative offices
and housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``These bases provide refuges for terrorists and train
terrorists for tactics and use of international weapons,'' said
General Hugh Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how many terrorists, if any, were killed in the
raids, which were launched under the cover of darkness. US
officials stopped short of declaring the mission a success, and
they admitted they did not know if bin Laden had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no idea of bin Laden's whereabouts or whether he was
in the camp at that time,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Taliban, the ruling party of Afghanistan,
said bin Laden was not at the site at the time and was not killed.
After the attacks, the FBI immediately warned all local law
enforcement agencies to be on a heightened level of alert for
possible terrorist retaliation on US soil. Embassy officials abroad
were also warned, as were US travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, most US diplomats and their families fled the
embassy in Pakistan out of a fear for another embassy bombing. This
move came as US officials gathered key intelligence data that
showed more attacks were planned in the terrorist world, officials
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The operation was executed with such extraordinary secrecy that
no US troops or ships were moved in the attack for fear of calling
attention to the plan. Also, no senior US national security
officials traveled to Martha's Vineyard this week to meet Clinton
so as not to alert news reporters covering the president.

 &HT;    ATTACKS FOLLOWED GROWING CONCERNS ABOUT PRODUCTION OF DEADLY VX
GAS IN SUDAN
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH and ANDREW ALEXANDER
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. attack on a chemical plant in Sudan
Thursday followed reports of growing concern among Western
intelligence agencies that facilities for the production of deadly
VX nerve gas had been secretly shipped to Sudan from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Jane's Intelligence Review, published by the authoritative,
London-based weapons information company, reported earlier this
week that United Nations arms inspectors and U.S. intelligence
officials believe equipment for production of VX that disappeared
from Iraq in mid-1995 and wound up in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Besides striking purported terrorist camps operated in
Afghanistan by renegade Saudi businessman and self-described
terrorism sponsor Osama bin Laden, U.S. Tomahawk cruise missiles
were used to bomb a ``Shifa Phamaceuticals'' chemical plant in
Khartoum, the Sudanese capital.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen and a senior intelligence
official told reporters Thursday the facility was turning out
precursor chemicals for VX production.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence official also told reporters at a Pentagon
briefing that the plant was part of a Sudanese enterprise formally
known as ``the Military-Industrial Complex,'' which has been
financially supported by Bin Laden. Sudanese officials insisted the
plant produced only pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   VX is an abbreviation for a 62-letter chemical term (which
contains no Vs and no Xs). Colorless and odorless, the chemical is
the most toxic nerve agent known, many times deadlier than hydrogen
cyanide gas. By blocking an enzyme that regulates nerve impulses,
it causes uncontrolled spasms and within minutes, death.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do know is that this facility that was targeted in
Khartoum produced the precursor chemicals that would allow the
production of a type of VX nerve agent,'' Cohen said. The
intelligence official at Cohen's briefing went further:
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we know that Bin Laden has made financial contributions
to the Sudanese Military-Industrial Complex. That's a distinct
entity of which, we believe, the Shifa pharmaceutical facility is
part. We know with high confidence that Shifa produces a precursor
that is unique to the production of VX. . .''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Butler, chairman of the United Nations Special
Commission that oversees the destruction of Iraqi weapons, has said
he believes 20 shipping containers with VX production equipment
disappeared from Iraq in mid-1995.
</P>
<P>
   Jayne's Intelligence Review reported Monday that U.S.
intelligence officials believe these containers were taken to
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine also reported on minutes of a two-day secret
meeting in Khartoum last October at which Sudanese officials
purportedly were assured of financial support from Bin Laden for
construction of a ``chemical and bacterial weapons factory'' in
Kubar, a suburb of Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
   Participants at the meeting agreed that the plant should be
brought into production ``as soon as possible,'' the magazine said
minutes of the meeting showed.
</P>
<P>
   Javed Ali, principal author of Jane's ``Chemical and Biological
Defense Guidebook,'' said VX has been around for about 50 years,
but only two countries, Russia and Iraq, have ever acknowledged
producing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not cutting edge technology,'' Ali said in an
interview. ``The British first developed the chemical in the late
1940s.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the chemicals that become VX when mixed together are
widely produced for peaceful reasons in many countries, especially
in the manufacture of pesticides, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob May, a farmer from eastern Arkansas who is in Sudan with a
group of Americans studying Christianity there, said Thursday that
he believes the factory was used exclusively to manufacture
pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have met some doctors here and they say the plant provides
90 percent of all medicines in this country,'' said May, who was
reached by phone in Khartoum several hours after the attack.
</P>
<P>
   May said the mood in Khartoum Thursday night was one of
puzzlement more than anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question in the Sudanese peoples' minds is: 'What in the
world does this have to do with Osama bin Laden?''' Why would the
U.S. direct an attack on this city (when) in fact they exiled him
from Sudan two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's attack is ``going to get the people aroused'' in the
coming days, he said. ``I think it may have been a mistake. It's
certainly put a lot of puzzlement on people's faces. ``
</P>
<P>
   But a security official at a downtown Khartoum hotel suggested
otherwise. Asked in a telephone interview what was produced at the
factory, he said: ``Between you and me, chemicals. They could be
used for chemical weapons. I know because I have very wide eyes. I
can tell when I look.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that in recent years Libyans had worked at the factory,
ostensibly producing insecticides.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very clever here,'' he said, suggesting that the
insecticide production was a cover. ``They can hide it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a curious coincidence of names caused the chairman of
a Syrian pharmaceutical manufacturer to announce following the
bombing that he would attempt to sue the Sudanese pharmaceutical
company for ``stealing our name.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard of these people because we export drugs to Iraq
under U.N. approval,'' said Imad Sabouni, chairman of Shifa
Pharmaceutical Industries of Aleppo, Syria. ``They also attempted
to sell to Iraq and that is when we learned that they also use the
name Shifa.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabouni also said in a telephone interview that his company had
no relationship with Bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God! Oh, my God! What is going on?'' Sabouni cried when
told that a pharmaceutical company with the same name as his
company's had been bombed for producing nerve gas precursors.
``Really, we do not have any relation with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabouni said that in Arabic the word ``Shifa'' means ``cure from
illness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When people are sick, they lie in bed and cry, 'Please, God,
give me me Shifa,''' he said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In mounting twin strikes at what President Clinton
called ``terrorist-related facilities in Afghanistan and Sudan,''
the United States on Thursday launched a hail of cruise missiles as
a lethal message to fundamentalist Islamic terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the missiles were aimed at the terrorist network
run by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born multi-millionaire said to be
behind the deadly truck bombings of two American embassies in East
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans on Capitol Hill, as well as critics abroad,
questioned whether Clinton, as commander-in-chief of the world's
only remaining superpower, had also sought to defuse his political
problems by approving the military attacks just three days after
having admitted he had ``misled people'' about his adulterous
affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   As independent counsel Ken Starr summoned Lewinsky to appear for
a second time before the grand jury that is looking into whether
Clinton had perjured himself, White House officials bristled at the
notion that the military strikes might have been timed by a
domestic political need to draw public attention away from the sex
scandal,
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reason to believe that a gathering of key terrorist
leaders was to take place (at bin Laden's Afghan base) today, thus
underscoring the urgency of our actions,'' Clinton asserted in a
speech from the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen days after the twin bombings in Kenya and Tanzania
killed 263 people, including 12 Americans, the president responded
by ordering nearly simultaneous strikes from naval vessels and a
submarine poised in both the Arabian and Red Seas.
</P>
<P>
   The Tomahawk missiles hit the bin Laden camp, about 95 miles
south of the Afghan capital of Kabul, and the El Shifa
pharmaceutical plant, in an industrial section of Khartoum, the
Sudanese capital, causing extensive damage and casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Denouncing the raid as a ``terrorist crime,'' Sudanese officials
said the privately owned factory manufactured only children's
medicines and malaria drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton interrupted his vacation on Martha's Vineyard to deliver
his seven-minute Oval Office address declaring an open-ended war on
Islamic ``fanatics.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave final approval for the raids, which began at 1:30 p.m.
EDT, shortly before dawn in Edgartown, Mass. And he was the first
to announce them, some 25 minutes after they began.
</P>
<P>
   In returning without his family to the White House -- shortly
after announcing the strikes in a terse speech at Edgartown --
Clinton also met with his top national security team and conferred
by phone with various world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is convincing information from our intelligence
community that the Bin Laden terrorist network was responsible''
for the recent carnage in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   The president also said there was ``compelling evidence that the
Bin Laden network of terrorist groups was planning to mount further
attacks against Americans and other freedom-loving people.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither the president nor any of his national security
advisers made public any specific information linking the
41-year-old bin Laden, who was said to have escaped injury, to the
embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, all but essential U.S. personnel have been
evacuated from U.S. embassies in Islamabad, Pakistan, and Tirana,
Albania, indicating that both sites could serve as fresh terrorist
targets.
</P>
<P>
   In a White House briefing that came almost immediately after
Clinton's Oval Office address, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said ``high-threat warnings'' have been issued to some
unspecified U.S. embassies.
</P>
<P>
   Albright added: ``We are very concerned about what is going on
internationally, which is why we are gathering international
support and why the president believed the seriousness of the
moment was one that required him to come back to Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger, who shared
the podium with Albright, revealed that the ``FBI has issued an
alert to all local law enforcement officials about the heightened
degree of concern (over terrorism) that they ought to manifest in
their work.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger also told reporters that the strike against the Sudanese
plant, from two ships in the Red Sea, was timed for the early
evening, in an effort, made at Clinton's specific request, to
minimize the loss of civilian life. He declined to give a number of
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   CIA Director George Tenet said that Bin Laden, who had been
ejected from Sudan at U.S. urging in May 1996, wanted chemical
weapons and that the Khartoum plant -- which Sudanese officials
claimed was being used solely to produce antibiotics and other
medicines -- could produce components for the deadly nerve agent
VX.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials place the Afghan camp -- comprising six sites,
including training and storage areas -- in another category: It was
deemed to be fair game as a military target.
</P>
<P>
   They said they had no information what damage, if any, the 50 or
so Tomahawks hurled against that complex, from four ships and a
sub, had caused. Nor, they said, did they know whether Bin Laden
had survived the U.S. raid.
</P>
<P>
   But Abdul Hai Mutmaen, a spokesman for the Islamic Taliban
movement, which rules most of Afghanistan, and which has been
harboring Bin Laden, said the terrorist chief had escaped the
strike without harm.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes were backed by several key lawmakers, including
House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia, one of the three top
congressional leaders who was informed beforehand of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think based on what I know that it was the right thing to do
at the right time . . . and I think it's been done in a methodical,
professional way,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., a member of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, told reporters in Philadelphia that ``there
is an obvious issue, which will be raised internationally, about
the response here as to whether there is any diversionary motive
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter cited earlier reports that the administration had been
negotiating with Afghan officials over turning over Bin Laden and
that the FBI ``has been conducting an investigation which might
lead to a prosecution if individuals were taken into custody.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., said he saw no connection
between the timing of the strikes and Clinton's personal woes, he
added: ``However, it does remind us of the importance of the
president's credibility.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As news of US military attacks on terrorist sites
abroad spread Thursday, so did questions about whether the White
House may have timed the operation to change the subject dominating
the news: President Clinton's affair with Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Dan Coats, an Indiana Republican, called the timing of
the military missions ``suspect.'' Senator Arlen Specter, a
Pennsylvania Republican, said it was fair to ask ``whether there
was any diversionary motive involved'' in the US attack.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials denied it. But certainly the
juxtaposition of a humiliated president retreating to a secluded
vacation spot on Martha's Vineyard Tuesday with the return Thursday
of a take-charge commmander in chief did not disappoint Clinton
image-minders.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did they lament that for a day, at least, the newspapers and
newscasts would feature foreign affairs rather than domestic ones.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Clinton stepped into the media center on Martha's
Vineyard to make his surprise announcement of the military attacks
at the same time that Lewinsky, a former White House intern, was
testifying to a grand jury in Washington for a second time about
her sexual relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that the president or the White House has been
particularly following her business today,'' White House spokesman
Michael McCurry told reporters on Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a reporter asked Defense Secretary William Cohen
if the timing of the military attack was influenced at all by the
president's problems at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only motivation driving this action today was our aboslute
obligation to protect the American people from terrorist
activities,'' Cohen answered. ``That was the sole motivation. No
other consideration has been involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most lawmakers from both parties, House Speaker Newt
Gingrich supported the president, saying it was ``sick'' to suggest
there was any motive other than national security that drove the
president's decision. ``It was the right thing to do at the right
time,'' the GOP leader said.
</P>
<P>
   By last evening, Spector said he had talked to administration
officials and was convinced that the attack was justified.
</P>
<P>
   But Coats, a member of both the Senate Intelligence and Armed
Services committees, wondered why the operation hadn't come last
week or next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is extrordinary, coming when the president is in
political extremis. People are raising legitmate questions about
the attacks, here and around the globe,'' Coats said.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Martin Meehan, a Massachusetets Democrat, said
the senators' statements were ``unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one thing for a radio talk-show host to bring up such
things, but for a US senator to do it is outrageous,'' Meehan said.
``The bombing of our embassy was very real. That 260 people were
murdered in Kenya and Tanzania was real. The movie was fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``movie'' most talked about Thursday was ``Wag the Dog,'' a
recent film in which Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman, portraying
two operatives in the White House, concoct a phony military
operation to divert attention and restore the popularity of a
president whose future is imperiled by a sexual encounter with a
Girl Scout.
</P>
<P>
   To some, a ``Wag the Dog'' scenario seemed just too cynical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with a spin machine like the one in this White House, I
would be very wary of jumping to any conclusions like that,'' said
Howard Kurtz, the Washington Post media critic and author of ``Spin
Cycle: Inside the White House Propaganda Machine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my opinion that it is not within the realm of possibility
that the president would engage in a Hollywoodized version of
reality, or send young men and women into battle, in order to cover
his embarrassment,'' said Marvin Kalb, director of the Shorenstein
Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy at Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the fact that people would even raise the issue of `Wag
the Dog' is a sad testimony to the cynicism which exists in the
American population, particularly after the president has been
lying to the people for seven months,'' Kalb said.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam War gave Americans good reason to challenge the
Pentagon on its judgment and veracity, and ever since Watergate
Americans have been skeptical about whether their president was
telling the whole truth at all times.
</P>
<P>
   But fresh from a public admission that for months he lied to his
family, friends, and the country about an ``inappropriate
relationship'' with Lewinsky, the president was sure to face
credibility problems as he led the nation into an unexpected and
uncertain military operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything the president does from now on will be subject to
this kind of skepticism, and all you can say is that he has brought
it on himself,'' said Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at the
Brookings Institution, a private group.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Gaffney, director of the Center for Security Policy, a
private group, said, ``Given what is at stake here, which is
nothing less than the security of the United States, I hope that
the president is acting in a sober way, that his intelligence was
good, and that it was done for a cause, not `Wag the Dog' effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, critics of the US action from the Sudan to Iran said
Clinton was trying to divert attention from the Lewinsky story. A
state-controlled Iranian radio broadcast monitored by the British
Broadcasting Company suggested that the military move was ``aimed
at covering up and overshadowing his problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservative commentator Arianna Huffington said she would not
be surprised if Harry Thomason, the Hollywood producer who has
helped the Clintons with scandal damage control and appeared before
the grand jury himself last week, had a hand in the orchestration
of the operation Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to pass judgment on its military necessity, but
I do say with absolute certainty that we can't have a person people
can't trust making life-and-death decisions and sending our
children to war,'' Huffington said. ``He needs to resign and leave
these decisions to someone we can trust.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In mounting twin strikes at what President Clinton
called ``terrorist-related facilities in Afghanistan and Sudan,''
the United States on Thursday launched a hail of cruise missiles as
a lethal message to fundamentalist Islamic terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the missiles were aimed at the terrorist network
run by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born multi-millionaire said to be
behind the deadly truck bombings of two American embassies in East
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans on Capitol Hill, as well as critics abroad,
questioned whether Clinton, as commander-in-chief of the world's
only remaining superpower, had also sought to defuse his political
problems by approving the military attacks just three days after
having admitted he had ``misled people'' about his adulterous
affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   As independent counsel Ken Starr summoned Lewinsky to appear for
a second time before the grand jury that is looking into whether
Clinton had perjured himself, White House officials bristled at the
notion that the military strikes might have been timed by a
domestic political need to draw public attention away from the sex
scandal,
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reason to believe that a gathering of key terrorist
leaders was to take place (at bin Laden's Afghan base) today, thus
underscoring the urgency of our actions,'' Clinton asserted in a
speech from the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen days after the twin bombings in Kenya and Tanzania
killed 263 people, including 12 Americans, the president responded
by ordering nearly simultaneous strikes from naval vessels and a
submarine poised in both the Arabian and Red Seas.
</P>
<P>
   The Tomahawk missiles hit the bin Laden camp, about 95 miles
south of the Afghan capital of Kabul, and the El Shifa
pharmaceutical plant, in an industrial section of Khartoum, the
Sudanese capital, causing extensive damage and casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Denouncing the raid as a ``terrorist crime,'' Sudanese officials
said the privately owned factory manufactured only children's
medicines and malaria drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton interrupted his vacation on Martha's Vineyard to deliver
his seven-minute Oval Office address declaring an open-ended war on
Islamic ``fanatics.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave final approval for the raids, which began at 1:30 p.m.
EDT, shortly before dawn in Edgartown, Mass. And he was the first
to announce them, some 25 minutes after they began.
</P>
<P>
   In returning without his family to the White House -- shortly
after announcing the strikes in a terse speech at Edgartown --
Clinton also met with his top national security team and conferred
by phone with various world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is convincing information from our intelligence
community that the Bin Laden terrorist network was responsible''
for the recent carnage in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   The president also said there was ``compelling evidence that the
Bin Laden network of terrorist groups was planning to mount further
attacks against Americans and other freedom-loving people.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither the president nor any of his national security
advisers made public any specific information linking the
41-year-old bin Laden, who was said to have escaped injury, to the
embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, all but essential U.S. personnel have been
evacuated from U.S. embassies in Islamabad, Pakistan, and Tirana,
Albania, indicating that both sites could serve as fresh terrorist
targets.
</P>
<P>
   In a White House briefing that came almost immediately after
Clinton's Oval Office address, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said ``high-threat warnings'' have been issued to some
unspecified U.S. embassies.
</P>
<P>
   Albright added: ``We are very concerned about what is going on
internationally, which is why we are gathering international
support and why the president believed the seriousness of the
moment was one that required him to come back to Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger, who shared
the podium with Albright, revealed that the ``FBI has issued an
alert to all local law enforcement officials about the heightened
degree of concern (over terrorism) that they ought to manifest in
their work.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger also told reporters that the strike against the Sudanese
plant, from two ships in the Red Sea, was timed for the early
evening, in an effort, made at Clinton's specific request, to
minimize the loss of civilian life. He declined to give a number of
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   CIA Director George Tenet said that Bin Laden, who had been
ejected from Sudan at U.S. urging in May 1996, wanted chemical
weapons and that the Khartoum plant -- which Sudanese officials
claimed was being used solely to produce antibiotics and other
medicines -- could produce components for the deadly nerve agent
VX.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials place the Afghan camp -- comprising six sites,
including training and storage areas -- in another category: It was
deemed to be fair game as a military target.
</P>
<P>
   They said they had no information what damage, if any, the 50 or
so Tomahawks hurled against that complex, from four ships and a
sub, had caused. Nor, they said, did they know whether Bin Laden
had survived the U.S. raid.
</P>
<P>
   But Abdul Hai Mutmaen, a spokesman for the Islamic Taliban
movement, which rules most of Afghanistan, and which has been
harboring Bin Laden, said the terrorist chief had escaped the
strike without harm.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes were backed by several key lawmakers, including
House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia, one of the three top
congressional leaders who was informed beforehand of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think based on what I know that it was the right thing to do
at the right time . . . and I think it's been done in a methodical,
professional way,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., a member of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, told reporters in Philadelphia that ``there
is an obvious issue, which will be raised internationally, about
the response here as to whether there is any diversionary motive
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter cited earlier reports that the administration had been
negotiating with Afghan officials over turning over Bin Laden and
that the FBI ``has been conducting an investigation which might
lead to a prosecution if individuals were taken into custody.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., said he saw no connection
between the timing of the strikes and Clinton's personal woes, he
added: ``However, it does remind us of the importance of the
president's credibility.''

 &HT;    ATTACKS FOLLOWED GROWING CONCERNS ABOUT PRODUCTION OF DEADLY VX
GAS IN SUDAN
 &HT;    With USSTRIKES-CHEMICAL-0821.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH and ANDREW ALEXANDER 
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. attack on a chemical plant in Sudan
Thursday followed reports of growing concern among Western
intelligence agencies that facilities for the production of deadly
VX nerve gas had been secretly shipped to Sudan from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Jane's Intelligence Review, published by the authoritative,
London-based weapons information company, reported earlier this
week that United Nations arms inspectors and U.S. intelligence
officials believe equipment for production of VX that disappeared
from Iraq in mid-1995 and wound up in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Besides striking purported terrorist camps operated in
Afghanistan by renegade Saudi businessman and self-described
terrorism sponsor Osama bin Laden, U.S. Tomahawk cruise missiles
were used to bomb a ``Shifa Phamaceuticals'' chemical plant in
Khartoum, the Sudanese capital.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen and a senior intelligence
official told reporters Thursday the facility was turning out
precursor chemicals for VX production.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence official also told reporters at a Pentagon
briefing that the plant was part of a Sudanese enterprise formally
known as ``the Military-Industrial Complex,'' which has been
financially supported by Bin Laden. Sudanese officials insisted the
plant produced only pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   VX is an abbreviation for a 62-letter chemical term (which
contains no Vs and no Xs). Colorless and odorless, the chemical is
the most toxic nerve agent known, many times deadlier than hydrogen
cyanide gas. By blocking an enzyme that regulates nerve impulses,
it causes uncontrolled spasms and within minutes, death.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do know is that this facility that was targeted in
Khartoum produced the precursor chemicals that would allow the
production of a type of VX nerve agent,'' Cohen said. The
intelligence official at Cohen's briefing went further:
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we know that Bin Laden has made financial contributions
to the Sudanese Military-Industrial Complex. That's a distinct
entity of which, we believe, the Shifa pharmaceutical facility is
part. We know with high confidence that Shifa produces a precursor
that is unique to the production of VX. . .''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Butler, chairman of the United Nations Special
Commission that oversees the destruction of Iraqi weapons, has said
he believes 20 shipping containers with VX production equipment
disappeared from Iraq in mid-1995.
</P>
<P>
   Jayne's Intelligence Review reported Monday that U.S.
intelligence officials believe these containers were taken to
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine also reported on minutes of a two-day secret
meeting in Khartoum last October at which Sudanese officials
purportedly were assured of financial support from Bin Laden for
construction of a ``chemical and bacterial weapons factory'' in
Kubar, a suburb of Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
   Participants at the meeting agreed that the plant should be
brought into production ``as soon as possible,'' the magazine said
minutes of the meeting showed.
</P>
<P>
   Javed Ali, principal author of Jane's ``Chemical and Biological
Defense Guidebook,'' said VX has been around for about 50 years,
but only two countries, Russia and Iraq, have ever acknowledged
producing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not cutting edge technology,'' Ali said in an
interview. ``The British first developed the chemical in the late
1940s.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the chemicals that become VX when mixed together are
widely produced for peaceful reasons in many countries, especially
in the manufacture of pesticides, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob May, a farmer from eastern Arkansas who is in Sudan with a
group of Americans studying Christianity there, said Thursday that
he believes the factory was used exclusively to manufacture
pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have met some doctors here and they say the plant provides
90 percent of all medicines in this country,'' said May, who was
reached by phone in Khartoum several hours after the attack.
</P>
<P>
   May said the mood in Khartoum Thursday night was one of
puzzlement more than anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question in the Sudanese peoples' minds is: 'What in the
world does this have to do with Osama bin Laden?''' Why would the
U.S. direct an attack on this city (when) in fact they exiled him
from Sudan two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's attack is ``going to get the people aroused'' in the
coming days, he said. ``I think it may have been a mistake. It's
certainly put a lot of puzzlement on people's faces. ``
</P>
<P>
   But a security official at a downtown Khartoum hotel suggested
otherwise. Asked in a telephone interview what was produced at the
factory, he said: ``Between you and me, chemicals. They could be
used for chemical weapons. I know because I have very wide eyes. I
can tell when I look.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that in recent years Libyans had worked at the factory,
ostensibly producing insecticides.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very clever here,'' he said, suggesting that the
insecticide production was a cover. ``They can hide it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a curious coincidence of names caused the chairman of
a Syrian pharmaceutical manufacturer to announce following the
bombing that he would attempt to sue the Sudanese pharmaceutical
company for ``stealing our name.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard of these people because we export drugs to Iraq
under U.N. approval,'' said Imad Sabouni, chairman of Shifa
Pharmaceutical Industries of Aleppo, Syria. ``They also attempted
to sell to Iraq and that is when we learned that they also use the
name Shifa.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabouni also said in a telephone interview that his company had
no relationship with Bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God! Oh, my God! What is going on?'' Sabouni cried when
told that a pharmaceutical company with the same name as his
company's had been bombed for producing nerve gas precursors.
``Really, we do not have any relation with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabouni said that in Arabic the word ``Shifa'' means ``cure from
illness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When people are sick, they lie in bed and cry, 'Please, God,
give me me Shifa,''' he said.

 &HT;    Commentary: Did calculation spur strikes? Whose, Clinton's or

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Yesterday the subject of this column was denial, as it
works within the first family and on a national scale. The subject
does not seem to be exhausted by any stretch.
</P>
<P>
   A certain form of denial, it can be argued, is sometimes
necessary in a nation's affairs.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing a movie about a president who stages a ``war'' to
deflect attention from a sex scandal, a lot of people had to do a
double take when news hit of strikes on suspected terrorist sites
in Afghanistan and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   To say this invites cynicism about Bill Clinton's motives could
not, obviously, be more of an understatement. Republicans such as
Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana quickly questioned the motives of the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's a safe bet many Americans, enough to carry the weight
of public opinion, will for at least a short time put aside their
quite reasonable misgivings and support the action, as did House
Speaker Newt Gingrich. Call it patriotic denial.
</P>
<P>
   A great national chat session will, of course, commence over
whether the deepening Monica Lewinsky crisis was a factor in the
decision to strike. As cynical as this may seem, it might be better
to hope it was.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky story has a global reach _ the immediate response
from a Sudanese spokesman was that the strike on Khartoum was an
attempt to deflect attention from the president's troubles. So some
measure of calculation about the effect of the story, and the
degree to which it may have emboldened terrorist groups to carry
out atrocities like those in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, surely
entered into the decision to launch the attacks Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the root of his calculation is his own interests or the
nation's, Clinton's decision to order these strikes involves
considerable risk.
</P>
<P>
   The president and Defense Secretary William Cohen both alluded
Thursday to an imminent threat of more attacks by the group
connected to renegade Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden. (Were
those threats, by the way, related to a perception that the Starr
investigation of Clinton makes the country more vulnerable?)
</P>
<P>
   While one purpose of the attacks may have been to attempt to
pre-empt more terrorism, however, they are certain only to redouble
the zeal for reprisal against the United States by the terrorists.
Any degree of success on their part is going to raise questions
about the advisability of Clinton's decision.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of the never-ending irony of these days that Clinton
in his speech Thursday afternoon could be so frank about global
affairs after failing to achieve this in his brief message about
personal matters Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The war against terrorism will be ``a long, ongoing struggle,''
the president said, and one in which the United States will
``remain a target.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidents have made sober pronouncements about terrorism
before, but these words represent a new realism _ how odd to find
those words, after ``Wag the Dog,'' after the events of this week _
about what the country will have to endure. It will be a long
struggle, longer than the term of this president, however long that
turns out to be.

   Whether the root of his calculation is his own interests or the
nation's, Clinton's decision to order these strikes involves
considerable risk.
</P>
<P>
   The president and Defense Secretary William Cohen both alluded
Thursday to an imminent threat of more attacks by the group
connected to renegade Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden. (Were
those threats, by the way, related to a perception that the Starr
investigation of Clinton makes the country more vulnerable?)
</P>
<P>
   While one purpose of the attacks may have been to attempt to
pre-empt more terrorism, however, they are certain only to redouble
the zeal for reprisal against the United States by the terrorists.
Any degree of success on their part is going to raise questions
about the advisability of Clinton's decision.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of the never-ending irony of these days that Clinton
in his speech Thursday afternoon could be so frank about global
affairs after failing to achieve this in his brief message about
personal matters Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The war against terrorism will be ``a long, ongoing struggle,''
the president said, and one in which the United States will
``remain a target.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidents have made sober pronouncements about terrorism
before, but these words represent a new realism _ how odd to find
those words, after ``Wag the Dog,'' after the events of this week _
about what the country will have to endure. It will be a long
struggle, longer than the term of this president, however long that
turns out to be.

 &HT;    The evolution of the cubicle
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   1950s _ Hamburg consultants Eberhard and Wolfgang Schnelle,
known as the Quickborner team, study the effect of office settings
on productivity. Theory develops that office workers are relatively
capable and do not need to be surveyed constantly.
</P>
<P>
   1960s _ A new breed of employee joins the U.S. work force: the
``professional,'' needing more space than a clerical worker but
less than a supervisor. IBM, Ford and DuPont experiment with office
designs: free-standing screens for privacy, desks arranged in
clusters. Bob Propst of Herman Miller in Zeeland, Mich., designs
the first ``cubicle.''
</P>
<P>
   1970s _ Quickborner theory takes off in America and leads to
primitive cubicles. In 1976, the power-equipped panel is invented
(where your phone and machinery are hooked up). Sales soar.
</P>
<P>
   1980s _ Economic boom brings heady times to cubicles.
Hierarchies flourish; some companies have as many as 14 grades of
cubicles _ the more powerful the employee, the better the cubicle.
</P>
<P>
   1990s _ Corporate down-sizing hurts cubicle diversity. Some
companies cut back to one standard cubicle.
</P>
<P>
   Cubicle chatter
</P>
<P>
   Cubicle design experts at Haworth Inc., in Holland, Mich.,
coined these terms for what we do in our cubicles:
</P>
<P>
   Chunking _ The way we remember things by association. A chunking
device would be a box to deposit papers you don't have time to do
something more meaningful with.
</P>
<P>
   Churn rate _ The speed by which employees are put on and taken
off teams.
</P>
<P>
   Hot desking _ Moving to a different work space each day because
you don't have an assigned desk. A downside of hot desking is that
you don't have the benefit of ``cognitive artifacts'' _ that is,
the little notes, ``in'' piles and other reminders you place around
your work space.

 &HT;    Cool cubicles, islands in a sea of conformity
 &HT;    (EDS: Photos available from New York Times News Service)
 &HT;    By Michele Chan Santos
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   These are the cubicles everyone in the office knows about.
They're the ones that show up on unofficial tours, attract kids
visiting the office, and offer a giggle, a smile or just a ``Hey,
that's cool.''
</P>
<P>
   In a desert of charcoal-colored panels, they stand out like
oases, cheerful and funky reminders of the world outside.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 60 percent of white-collar workers _ that's 40 million
Americans _ work in a cubicle every day. In the Austin area, where
109,000 high-tech workers and 128,000 government workers are
employed, that percentage may be even higher.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, in the hands of creative Central Texans, even the
most sterile of spaces comes vividly to life.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Somerville and Warren Alverson
</P>
<P>
   What they do: Software engineers, Smart Technologies
</P>
<P>
   What makes their cubicles cool: A thatched rattan-and-bamboo
roof. Somerville and Alverson's cubicles are side-by-side, and the
bright lights on the ceiling were giving them headaches as they
worked on their computers. (They were first inspired by fellow
engineer Craig Dunn, who has his cubicle enclosed with a roof and
dark green shower curtain.) Somerville devised the screen, using
mats and real bamboo, and built it over the course of three
weekends. The structure shades their area, makes the work easier on
their eyes, and gives their office a ``Gilligan's Island'' kind of
style.
</P>
<P>
   Why they did it: ``We work too much to not pretend we're on
vacation,'' Somerville says of the 8-to 20-hour days he and
Alverson log at their desks. ``We need a hammock.''
</P>
<P>
   So if their office is Gilligan's Island, who is the Skipper and
who is Gilligan? ``We both want to be the Professor,'' Somerville
says.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McAfee
</P>
<P>
   What he does: Vice president and creative director, GSD&AMP;M
advertising agency
</P>
<P>
   What makes his cubicle cool: His desk. It combines an old Jack
in the Box restaurant booth with a fish-shaped table. The collage
on the surface of the table incorporates pictures of floating doll
heads, cupids, sharks, flowers and eyeballs. Mounted on top of the
green-and-yellow restaurant seats are miniature plastic nuns and
hula girls, waving on tiny springs. McAfee got the desk from
friends who used to own ``Studio Suave'' on 29th Street. He'd
noticed it in their kitchen and always liked it. Artist Aletha
Reppell created the collage. The booth was ``too intense'' to put
in his home, but it went well with the bright and colorful interior
of GSD&AMP;M's offices. ``I like the idea of unique office spaces,''
McAfee says. ``It's amazing how important the atmosphere you work
in is.''
</P>
<P>
   What else is in his office: Black and white photos of friends,
prints from his mom.
</P>
<P>
   What he's thinking of adding: A love seat.
</P>
<P>
   Peggie Laser
</P>
<P>
   What she does: Project Manager, Management Information Systems,
Texas Department of Human Resources
</P>
<P>
   What makes her cubicle cool: Her pet rose-haired tarantula,
``Red Hot Chili Pepper,'' or ``Chili,'' for short. Chili lives in a
glass aquarium on Laser's desk. Every two weeks, Laser feeds Chili
a dozen live crickets or grasshoppers. Chili sinks her fangs into
them, paralyzes them, and sucks their insides out. Feeding time is
a popular attraction among Laser's co-workers. Every six months,
Chili sheds, leaving behind a skin that ``looks like another whole
spider,'' Laser says. There's a drawing in the office to determine
who gets to bring Chili's old skin home _ great for the kids'
show-and-tell.
</P>
<P>
   What else is in the cubicle: A photo of Willie Nelson and George
Strait at a golf tournament, signed by Strait; a plastic floating
eyeball; a picture of Laser with Darrell Royal; autographed photos
of Houston Astros players; a black plastic spider and black plastic
ants.
</P>
<P>
   If her pet at work is a tarantula, what's her pet at home? Two
cats, a cockatiel and a black shark that's more than a foot long,
named Black Bart.
</P>
<P>
   Merry Wade
</P>
<P>
   What she does: Mainframe computer operator, Texas Rehabilitation
Commission
</P>
<P>
   What makes her cubicle cool: Every square inch of it is covered
with magnets, comic strips, stickers, inspirational quotes,
photographs or buttons. The messages range from the amusing
(``Blonde jokes are short so men can remember them'') to the
serious (``Life's most persistent and urgent question is, 'What are
you doing for others?' '' _ Martin Luther King Jr.) Strips from
Garfield, Peanuts, Calvin and Hobbes, For Better or Worse, Frank &AMP;
Ernest, Mutts and B.C. all make an appearance. There is a profusion
of plants, too. ``You half expect to smell potpourri, be served
tea, and hear a little bell ringing when someone comes into the
office,'' says Wade's supervisor, Russell Smith. Wade works at
night; during the day, when she's gone, her co-workers will take
their coffee breaks at her desk because it's so entertaining. Wade
knows an item belongs in her cubicle if it ``gives me a giggle,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Samanthi Martinez
</P>
<P>
   What she does: Finance manager, Enterprise Customer Financial
Services, Dell
</P>
<P>
   What makes her cubicle cool: Martinez and her co-workers
decorated their area of the office in a beach-party theme. Colored
plastic leis, inflated beach balls and miniature inflatable killer
whales hang from the ceiling. Decorating the office is a popular
pastime at Dell _ another division, Martinez says, once dressed up
their area in a jungle theme, complete with camouflage netting. In
her cubicle, Martinez also has several art prints, photographs of
her family and postcards.
</P>
<P>
   Why decorating is important: ``It helps with morale,'' Martinez
says.
</P>
<P>
   Douphitt Briggs
</P>
<P>
   What he does: Consultant, new products and services, Texas
Guaranteed Student Loan Corp.
</P>
<P>
   What makes his cubicle cool: Elvis. The desk is arrayed with a
deck of Elvis playing cards, a ticket from Graceland, an Elvis
pop-up book, a copy of the ``Love Me Tender'' CD (the CD itself is
shaped like Elvis), an Elvis postcard and a copy of the ``Got
Milk?'' ad featuring Elvis impersonators. Shiny gold foil covers
the wall of the cubicle and flashing Christmas lights line the
edges. There's a bottle of Elvis cologne with the $1.99 price tag
still attached. The window is festooned with a piece of
gold-colored poster board, cut out in the shape of a light-- ing
bolt, with ``TCB'' at the top. This was the symbol Elvis gave to
his bodyguards, also known as the ``Memphis Mafia.'' ``TCB'' stands
for ``Taking Care of Business.''
</P>
<P>
   Why Elvis? Last Halloween, everyone in Briggs' department
decorated their cubicles in a ``Dead Rock Star'' theme. Briggs left
his cubicle decorated, and as the months went by, his co-workers
gave him more Elvis items.
</P>
<P>
   What really makes his cubicle classy: The fake jaguar fur
covering the desk. Almost as nice as the rhinestones on the coffee
mug.

 &HT;    ATTACKS FOLLOWED GROWING CONCERNS ABOUT PRODUCTION OF DEADLY VX
GAS IN SUDAN
 &HT;    With USSTRIKES-CHEMICAL-0821.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH and ANDREW ALEXANDER 
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. attack on a chemical plant in Sudan
Thursday followed reports of growing concern among Western
intelligence agencies that facilities for the production of deadly
VX nerve gas had been secretly shipped to Sudan from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Jane's Intelligence Review, published by the authoritative,
London-based weapons information company, reported earlier this
week that United Nations arms inspectors and U.S. intelligence
officials believe equipment for production of VX that disappeared
from Iraq in mid-1995 and wound up in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Besides striking purported terrorist camps operated in
Afghanistan by renegade Saudi businessman and self-described
terrorism sponsor Osama bin Laden, U.S. Tomahawk cruise missiles
were used to bomb a ``Shifa Phamaceuticals'' chemical plant in
Khartoum, the Sudanese capital.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen and a senior intelligence
official told reporters Thursday the facility was turning out
precursor chemicals for VX production.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence official also told reporters at a Pentagon
briefing that the plant was part of a Sudanese enterprise formally
known as ``the Military-Industrial Complex,'' which has been
financially supported by Bin Laden. Sudanese officials insisted the
plant produced only pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   VX is an abbreviation for a 62-letter chemical term (which
contains no Vs and no Xs). Colorless and odorless, the chemical is
the most toxic nerve agent known, many times deadlier than hydrogen
cyanide gas. By blocking an enzyme that regulates nerve impulses,
it causes uncontrolled spasms and within minutes, death.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do know is that this facility that was targeted in
Khartoum produced the precursor chemicals that would allow the
production of a type of VX nerve agent,'' Cohen said. The
intelligence official at Cohen's briefing went further:
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we know that Bin Laden has made financial contributions
to the Sudanese Military-Industrial Complex. That's a distinct
entity of which, we believe, the Shifa pharmaceutical facility is
part. We know with high confidence that Shifa produces a precursor
that is unique to the production of VX. . .''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Butler, chairman of the United Nations Special
Commission that oversees the destruction of Iraqi weapons, has said
he believes 20 shipping containers with VX production equipment
disappeared from Iraq in mid-1995.
</P>
<P>
   Jayne's Intelligence Review reported Monday that U.S.
intelligence officials believe these containers were taken to
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine also reported on minutes of a two-day secret
meeting in Khartoum last October at which Sudanese officials
purportedly were assured of financial support from Bin Laden for
construction of a ``chemical and bacterial weapons factory'' in
Kubar, a suburb of Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
   Participants at the meeting agreed that the plant should be
brought into production ``as soon as possible,'' the magazine said
minutes of the meeting showed.
</P>
<P>
   Javed Ali, principal author of Jane's ``Chemical and Biological
Defense Guidebook,'' said VX has been around for about 50 years,
but only two countries, Russia and Iraq, have ever acknowledged
producing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not cutting edge technology,'' Ali said in an
interview. ``The British first developed the chemical in the late
1940s.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the chemicals that become VX when mixed together are
widely produced for peaceful reasons in many countries, especially
in the manufacture of pesticides, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob May, a farmer from eastern Arkansas who is in Sudan with a
group of Americans studying Christianity there, said Thursday that
he believes the factory was used exclusively to manufacture
pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have met some doctors here and they say the plant provides
90 percent of all medicines in this country,'' said May, who was
reached by phone in Khartoum several hours after the attack.
</P>
<P>
   May said the mood in Khartoum Thursday night was one of
puzzlement more than anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question in the Sudanese peoples' minds is: 'What in the
world does this have to do with Osama bin Laden?''' Why would the
U.S. direct an attack on this city (when) in fact they exiled him
from Sudan two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's attack is ``going to get the people aroused'' in the
coming days, he said. ``I think it may have been a mistake. It's
certainly put a lot of puzzlement on people's faces. ``
</P>
<P>
   But a security official at a downtown Khartoum hotel suggested
otherwise. Asked in a telephone interview what was produced at the
factory, he said: ``Between you and me, chemicals. They could be
used for chemical weapons. I know because I have very wide eyes. I
can tell when I look.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that in recent years Libyans had worked at the factory,
ostensibly producing insecticides.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very clever here,'' he said, suggesting that the
insecticide production was a cover. ``They can hide it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a curious coincidence of names caused the chairman of
a Syrian pharmaceutical manufacturer to announce following the
bombing that he would attempt to sue the Sudanese pharmaceutical
company for ``stealing our name.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard of these people because we export drugs to Iraq
under U.N. approval,'' said Imad Sabouni, chairman of Shifa
Pharmaceutical Industries of Aleppo, Syria. ``They also attempted
to sell to Iraq and that is when we learned that they also use the
name Shifa.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabouni also said in a telephone interview that his company had
no relationship with Bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God! Oh, my God! What is going on?'' Sabouni cried when
told that a pharmaceutical company with the same name as his
company's had been bombed for producing nerve gas precursors.
``Really, we do not have any relation with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabouni said that in Arabic the word ``Shifa'' means ``cure from
illness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When people are sick, they lie in bed and cry, 'Please, God,
give me me Shifa,''' he said.

LEWINSKY TELLS JURY MORE DETAILS ABOUT SEX AND GIFTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In her second and probably final appearance before
a grand jury here, Monica Lewinsky on Thursday offered more
specifics about her sexual relationship with President Clinton and
the gifts he gave her as prosecutors sought to draw distinctions
between her testimony and that of the president only three days
ago.
</P>
<P>
   During the five-hour session, prosecutors bore in on the series
of events that led Ms. Lewinsky to return gifts from the president
that had been subpoenaed in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct
lawsuit last December, lawyers close to the case said.
</P>
<P>
   The events surrounding the gifts are potentially the most
serious for the president because prosecutors are trying to
determine whether he obstructed justice by telling Ms. Lewinsky to
turn the gifts over to his secretary, Betty Currie, rather than
give them to lawyers for Mrs. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky told prosecutors Thursday that she told Clinton
last December that the Jones subpoena demanded gifts he had given
her, a lawyer familiar with her account said. The president told
her that she could not turn over the gifts if they were not in her
possession, Ms. Lewinsky has told prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The day after her discussion with the president, Ms. Lewinsky
received a phone call from Ms. Currie, who told her, ``I hear you
have something for me,'' she told the grand jury. Ms. Lewinsky said
she assumed that Ms. Currie was referring to the gifts, according
to lawyers familiar with her account. Later that day, Ms. Currie
went to Ms. Lewinsky's apartment to retrieve the gifts, lawyers
said.
</P>
<P>
   But this account differs in some respects from Clinton's own
testimony last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the prosecutors that he told Ms. Lewinsky in
December 1997 that she had no choice but to turn over gifts he had
given her to the Jones lawyers, according to lawyers familiar with
his testimony Monday. When asked about the role of Ms. Currie, he
said he could not recall telling her to call Ms. Lewinsky about the
gifts. Prosecutors are also investigating whether Clinton kept some
of the gifts given to him by Ms. Lewinsky that had been subpoenaed
by lawyers in the Jones case, according to lawyers close to the
case.
</P>
<P>
   During Clinton's grand jury testimony Monday, prosecutors also
asked him whether he deliberately wore a necktie, given to him by
Ms. Lewinsky, during a Rose Garden appearance Aug. 6, the day she
first testified before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he did not believe the gold and royal blue tie had
been a gift from her. He was then informed she had testified she
gave it to him and the prosecutors asked if he had worn it that day
as some kind of a ``signal'' to her, perhaps to influence her
testimony. Clinton said again he could not remember if the tie came
from her. But he insisted that he had no intention of sending Ms.
Lewinsky any kind of message that day.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky offered many more specifics of her sexual
encounters with the president than she gave in her original
testimony two weeks ago, according to her friends and associates.
The specifics of their physical contacts are also central to the
prosecutors' case as they try to determine whether Clinton
committed perjury in a deposition in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, these people said, told the panel that Clinton
caressed her breasts and touched her genitals during their affair
inside the White House. Her account was far more detailed than the
president's testimony Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Before he began Monday, Clinton admitted to the grand jury in a
statement supplied by his lawyers that he had had ``inappropriate
intimate physical contact'' with Ms. Lewinsky in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   As prosecutors continue to try to determine whether Clinton lied
in his January deposition in the Jones case, lawyers on both sides
continue to wrangle over what constitutes sexual conduct. In his
Monday testimony, Clinton argued that the type of relationship he
had with Ms. Lewinsky did not meet the definition of sex used by
Mrs. Jones' lawyers, according to lawyers close to the case. Three
lawyers said he was implying that he had oral sex with Ms. Lewinsky
without testifying to that directly.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors are expected to argue that the acts described by
Ms. Lewinsky on Thursday fall within the definition of ``sexual
relations'' used by the Jones lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the testimony, prosecutors have obtained a sample of
Clinton's genetic material to determine if it matches a semen stain
on a dress Ms. Lewinsky turned over to prosecutors, according to
lawyers close to the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI crime laboratory has determined that the stain on the
blue dress was semen, two officials briefed on the results said
Thursday. If the DNA in that stain matches the DNA sample from the
president, they would have forensic proof that the 52-year-old
president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was sexual.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said administration officials turned over the
tissue? sample from the president at some point before he testified
Monday, presumably over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   An adviser to the president said Thursday night that the DNA
sample was requested from Clinton last Friday and provided over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers familiar with Clinton's testimony Monday said
prosecutors asked him several questions about the dress.
Prosecutors apparently considered it important to obtain forensic
proof of the relationship as well, perhaps anticipating that
Clinton would likely maintain that his contacts with Ms. Lewinsky
did not fit the definition in the Jones case.

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The government's antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft Corp. was
postponed for two weeks Thursday to allow for delays incurred while
news organizations sought access to depositions of company
executives, including chairman Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court ruled Wednesday that pretrial
depositions could resume without reporters present. Wednesday the
district judge overseeing the case agreed to postpone the trial
until Sept. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson also said he would hear oral
arguments Sept. 8, the day the trial had been scheduled to start,
on Microsoft's motion for a summary judgment dismissing the case
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The company filed that request last week, saying the
government's claims were based on a false assertion that it had
``foreclosed'' the ability of Netscape Communications and other
competitors to supply Web browsing software to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   `` ... The undisputed facts show that no such `foreclosure' has
occurred,'' Microsoft said.
</P>
<P>
   In the antitrust case filed May 18, the government's main
allegation is that Microsoft forced computer makers to accept its
Internet browser software if they wanted to license its Windows
operating system, which controls the computer's basic look, feel
and operation.
</P>
<P>
   Windows so dominates its market that computer makers have no
real alternative to it, so Microsoft's action was an abuse of
monopoly power, the government asserts.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Microsoft argues that it has integrated the browser
technology into Windows in ways that benefit both consumers and
software vendors _ and that comply fully with antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking access to the pretrial depositions, the news
organizations cited a 1913 law that, while obscure, was nonetheless
plain in requiring the sessions to be open, Jackson ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft quickly appealed, saying it feared the disclosure of
highly sensitive business information if reporters and the public
attended the sessions.
</P>
<P>
   It also argued that procedures for trials and depositions have
changed substantially since 1913, and that the old law may be
superseded by newer federal rules authorizing judges to decide who
may attend depositions.
</P>
<P>
   In the handful of cases that cite the old law, ``none purport to
analyze in any depth'' the apparent conflict between it and the new
rules, one legal scholar wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court, in its ruling on Wednesday, said it would
hear legal arguments later and gave the parties until Sept. 29 to
file briefs on the matter. To keep the case from stalling, it said
depositions could be taken under an earlier protective order set up
to allow testimony to be made public without compromising
Microsoft's trade secrets or other sensitive information.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Ward Brown, a lead attorney for the news organizations said,
however, that they would file a motion Friday asking the appeals
court to issue a decision before Sept. 23, when the trial is to
start.
</P>
<P>
   Most or all of the depositions will have been taken by then,
Brown said, but if the news organizations prevail, they will become
public sooner than they would under the schedule set on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The depositions of Gates and other Microsoft executives will be
taken ``as quickly as we can get them scheduled,'' spokesman Jim
Cullinan said, but the times and places will not be disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Under the protective order already in place, the person giving
testimony answers all questions and each side has a certain number
of days afterward to designate portions of the testimony
``confidential'' or ``highly confidential'' and ask that access to
it be restricted.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the nature of the information, the restrictions can
bar disclosure not just to the public and news reporters but to
officials of the companies involved and their in-house attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, in its motion to keep the sessions private, noted
that some of the depositions taken so far include information so
sensitive that it ``cannot be seen even by the Microsoft in-house
lawyers who are involved in the preparation of this case.''
</P>
<P>
   If reporters and the public ultimately win access to any
depositions, sensitive information would still be protected.
</P>
<P>
   The news organizations ``have never contended that the statute
requires disclosure of Microsoft trade secrets,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the order Jackson issued last week saying the depositions
would be open, attorneys for Microsoft, the government and the news
organizations were negotiating a set of procedures for handling
sensitive information, among other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Those procedures have not been made public, but lawyers said
they would likely have called for supervision by the judge or
frequent conferences with him as specific issues came up during
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't clear what status the news organizations would have in
those conferences, Brown said, but they would have a ``greater
chance'' of avoiding overly broad restrictions if the sessions were
public from the outset.

   Gymnastics bosses &QL; 
just code-blooded
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
INDIANAPOLIS _ You see Kim Zmeskal sprint across the floor, pumping
her legs, twisting and leaping, and realize this is where the
search for Olympic magnificence should continue.
</P>
<P>
   Here, amid the haze of chalk and din of squealing pre-teen fans,
lots of talented girls and a handful of superstar young women hope
to succeed the ``Magnificent Seven,'' the 1996 U.S. women's
gymnastics team that dazzled the world.
</P>
<P>
   Zmeskal, 22, is in terrific shape. Dominique Moceanu, 16, looks
to make it back to the Games, this time as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   But for Zmeskal and Moceanu, two of the greatest athletes
Houston has produced and among the biggest names in the sport, it's
going to be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   This meet is where we should see Zmeskal begin an amazing
comeback story and Moceanu prove she might be taller than two years
ago but she's still among the best. This should be a meet where the
next generation learns from the golden generation and together they
head to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere between Atlanta and here, international gymnastics
powers decided to forget everything good that came out of the 1996
Games, instead stumbling backward and revisiting a dangerous time.
</P>
<P>
   A ghastly past
</P>
<P>
   The lowest era this sport has known was from 1989-1992. Just
being thin was not in. Being emaciated was in. Pushing it to the
brink of disaster was not considered abuse. It was training.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, after watching a 14-year-old Olympic hopeful struggle
through a training session, her face drawn and tired, I asked,
``What did you eat yesterday?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Two bowls of rice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't talking about breakfast, lunch or dinner. She was
talking about the entire day. It was a sign of the times.
</P>
<P>
   But overzealous coaches, star-struck parents and children who
knew no better were only partly to blame. The biggest reason for
the embarrassment was something known as ``the code,'' a golden
carrot of sorts that federation officials hung out in front of
kids.
</P>
<P>
   It is the International Gymnastics Federation Code of Points, a
scoring standard for routines that athletes must attempt if they
want to earn high scores. The vaults Mary Lou Retton used to become
the world's darling in 1984, for example, would have started out
with a value of only about 9.7 based on the 1992 code.
</P>
<P>
   The international federation was force-feeding extreme
difficulty into routines, thereby starving athletes and blinding
coaches from doing reasonable things. The message was clear: Find
athletes who can tumble faster and higher, twist stronger and
tighter, but still score 10.0s. Kids, basically.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. coach Bela Karolyi looked at the stick-like girls on the
Chinese Olympic team in 1992 and joked about them having ``their
milk teeth.'' But it was no joke.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, after enduring criticism for the eating problems and
injuries, the code became reasonable and minimum-age requirements
were implemented. Nutritional programs were developed, too.
</P>
<P>
   It was all good. It also was why we saw Shannon Miller,
Dominique Dawes, Kerri Strug and Co., polished, proven and grown
up, thrill the world in Atlanta. The difficulty was there, but so
were mature athletes who looked like women and entertained massive
TV audiences.
</P>
<P>
   It should have been the moment that opened the federation's eyes
to what the world wants to see. It should have led to the likes of
Zmeskal _ proven veterans, not stick-girls _ having a chance of
making it to Sydney. But remarkably, the international federation
again raised the code of points to unkind levels for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Difficulty levels increased
</P>
<P>
   Today, the memorable vault that launched Strug to superstardom
two years ago would start out with a value of just 9.8. As much as
Moceanu looks terrific here and Zmeskal is tumbling strong, they
are having trouble keeping up the difficulty levels to the current
standards. At a time when the sport should ride a wave of
popularity that its stars provided, the federation has made it more
difficult on those same stars.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Probably fewer than 10 percent of Olympic TV viewers can
tell you the difference between a pike and a tuck. People want to
see 9.9s and 10.0s, not the falling-down 9.2s that opened
Thursday's national championships.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries are piling up. Some athletes again look 16 going on
12. Two of Houston's other top 2000 hopefuls, Kendall Beck and
Lindsay Wing, will not compete here. Beck tore an anterior cruciate
ligament in her knee practicing a vault. Wing is taking time off
because of what doctors diagnosed as food allergies.
</P>
<P>
   And how can the federation ignore the horrible accident that
left China's Sang Lan, 17, paralyzed after missing a vault at the
Goodwill Games?
</P>
<P>
   They didn't just raise the bar. They greased it. Unless the code
is adjusted downward, which the federation has shown no inclination
to do, athletes will crash to the mats from here to Sydney.

AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP ACQUIRES SUNAMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Md.)  (ART ADV: A graphic detailing the AIG acquisition of SunAmerica is
being sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make
individual purchase by calling 888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.) 
(js) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a merger of insurance giants, American International Group, a
world leader in corporate insurance, agreed Thursday to buy
SunAmerica Inc., one of the pioneers in selling investments for
retirement, for stock valued at $17.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, one of the largest in the financial services industry,
vaults American International Group into the rapidly growing
business of variable annuities _ mutual funds with insurance that
protects against market dips _ and gives SunAmerica a springboard
to worldwide expansion through American International Group's
offices in 130 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also brings together a pair of chief executives _
Maurice ``Hank'' Greenberg of American International Group and Eli
Broad of SunAmerica _ who are among the most respected and admired
in the insurance business. Both hold large stakes in their
companies and are among the world's wealthiest people with fortunes
exceeding $1 billion each.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg is to continue as chairman and chief executive and
Broad will become a member of the board of the merged company.
Broad, whose personal wealth would jump more than $250 million in
the transaction, will continue to direct SunAmerica from its
headquarters in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrific fit,'' Alice Schroeder, an analyst at Paine
Webber, said. ``It fills the biggest hole in AIG's product lineup
and offers a platform that SunAmerica can instantly plug into its
globalization strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms, SunAmerica shareholders will get 0.855 of one
AIG share for each SunAmerica share. Based on AIG's closing price
of $94.625 Wednesday before the announcement, the deal is worth
$17.8 billion. The purchase price comes to more than five times
SunAmerica's book value of $2.966 billion at a time when shares of
leading competitors are trading at about four times their book
value.
</P>
<P>
   AIG's stock dropped 7.5 percent to close at $87.50 Thursday
while shares of SunAmerica rose 11.1 percent to close at $71.375.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are sort of giving a thumbs down to the price,''
said Eric Berg, an analyst at CIBC Oppenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   But Berg and others described SunAmerica as ``an exceptional
company,'' worthy of an exceptional price. ``You can't buy a good
franchise at a bargain price,'' said Ms. Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Greenberg said he felt confident the price was not
excessive. There is an enormous market for SunAmerica's variable
annuities and other retirement investments around the world, he
said, and the combined company will go after that. ``The need is
global,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of huge new overseas markets has been a driving
force in several recent financial services megamergers, notably the
combination of Citicorp and Travelers Group. Like AIG and
SunAmerica, partners in the Citicorp-Travelers deal hope to exploit
each other's strengths to sell products around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said the AIG-SunAmerica deal, first reported
Thursday in The Wall Street Journal, could look less promising if
the stock markets fell and investors began to shy away from
variable annuities, which have been SunAmerica's main engine for
growth. ``That's maybe a near-term implication,'' said Jay Cohen,
an analyst at Merrill Lynch. ``But long-term, I don't see a lot of
downside.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts cautioned that the merged company might find it
difficult to introduce American-style retirement products in some
countries. Introducing new products to each other's sales forces
for so-called cross-selling, the analysts noted, has proved
daunting to some companies.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>

   nn
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg and Broad, who have been friends for nearly a decade,
said they believed that their personal styles and their corporate
cultures would integrate well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Hank and I and our people are Type A people,'' Broad
said. ``We like to win. We're very competitive. We believe in doing
things in a quality way and we're owner-operators.''
</P>
<P>
   While the two companies are publicly owned, Greenberg, 73, and
Broad, 65, have run them rather like entrepreneurs, avoiding layers
of committees and leaving no doubt where power resides.
</P>
<P>
   Broad literally built SunAmerica from the ground up. While
running a successful construction business, he bought Sun Life
Insurance Co.of America, an old-line life insurance company in
Baltimore, as a hedge against a downturn in housing. But in 1989 he
spun off the construction business. Perceiving great demand for
investments aimed at providing money for retirement as the American
population aged, Broad abandoned the sale of traditional life
insurance and began to sell insurance only in connection with
mutual funds and other investments. He took the company public in
1989 and owns nearly 42 percent of it.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg was not a founder of AIG but is responsible for the
company's extraordinary growth by taking it public in 1969, nine
years after he joined the company and one year after he became
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Back then it had a market value of about $300 million. Today it
operates 300 subsidiaries, in businesses ranging from its signature
corporate coverage to automobile and life insurance, and has a
market value of about $92 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg's son, Evan Greenberg, in his mid-40s, is president
and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, AIG, with assets of $164 billion, reported net income
of $3.3 billion on revenues of $30.6 billion. Net income for
SunAmerica, with assets of 35.6 billion, was $379 million on
revenues of $5.3 billion. For the last decade, SunAmerica's stock
has been one of the best-performing issues on the New York Stock
Exchange, rising an average of 42 percent a year. In the last five
years, AIG's stock value has more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
   AIG plans to use the pooling method of accounting in the merger,
which shields the merged company from some one-time charges that
would reduce future earnings. The swap of stock for stock also
means SunAmerica shareholders will not be liable for taxes from an
increase in the value of their investment until they decide to sell
their new AIG stock.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, Broad said, the merger would give SunAmerica
entree to scores of blue-chip corporate clients of AIG. And Larry
Mayewski, a senior vice president and analyst at AM Best &AMP; Co., a
rating agency, said SunAmerica's nationwide network of
broker-dealers would become an outlet for such AIG products as auto
and life insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were generally effusive about the merger. ``This is a
great deal in every way,'' said Michael Frinquelli, a principal in
Renaissance Fund Advisers, a hedge fund specializing in insurance.
``Most importantly you're marrying the two smartest guys in their
respective businesses. Ask anybody in property and casualty who
their idol is and it's Hank Greenberg. Ask anybody in the annuities
business and it's Eli Broad.''

WITNESS PAINTS KLAN AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HATTIESBURG, Miss. _ Spectators here at the trial of a former
Klansman accused of ordering the murder of a respected civil rights
leader were surprised, to say the least, when another former
Klansman described the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of
Mississippi as a benevolent organization that existed to give money
to the rural poor and pass out fruit baskets at Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the older black people in the courtroom shook their
hands, some of them snickered and a few laughed out loud when
Deavours Nix, a defense witness and former Klansman, testified that
he never even heard the defendant, Samuel F. Bowers, use a racial
slur.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers, the Imperial Wizard who led the Mississippi White
Knights when the violent organization was linked to killings,
church burnings and beatings in the 1960s, stands accused for the
fifth time of ordering the murder of Vernon Dahmer, a black grocer
who was killed when his home was firebombed by Klansmen on Jan. 10,
1966. Both the prosecution and the defense wrapped up their cases
Thursday, with closing arguments scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Nix, who held the Klan title of ``State Investigator'' though he
said he does not know what that title means and he attended only
three or so Klan meetings, described Bowers, now 73, as a
``patriot'' who was respectful to ladies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not used profane language and I never heard him use a
racial slur,'' said Nix, who is accused of taking part in the
firebombing that killed Dahmer, a NAACP leader who was helping
blacks register to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Nix suffers from cancer and heart and lung ailments and
testified in a wheelchair with an oxygen bottle attached. He and
another former Klansman, Charles Noble, are expected to go on trial
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Nix testified Thursday that to his knowledge, Bowers was never
the leader of the Mississippi Klan, that the Klan did not stand for
violence and that he, himself, was never that much involved in it,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   He only joined, he said, because he heard that the Klan ``did
some benevolent work, such as delivering baskets of fruit at
Christmastime to people that was needy.'' He never had a robe, he
said. He did not hear racial slurs at the Klan meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But three former Klansmen who became government informers have
testified that Bowers planned and ordered Dahmer's murder at Klan
meetings in 1965. Bowers walked free, three decades ago, after
juries in four trials deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
   This trial has boiled down to the word of two factions: those
former Klansmen who described Bowers as a coldly racist leader who
masterminded the execution of Dahmer, paired against people who
were either members of the Klan or had Klan ties.
</P>
<P>
   The lead prosecutor, Robert Helfrich, picked apart Nix's
testimony one statement at a time, showing gaps in the truth that
had the courtroom laughing. For example, there was this exchange:
</P>
<P>
   ``What color was your robe,'' Helfrich asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have no robe,'' Nix said.
</P>
<P>
   Helfrich handed him a picture, from an FBI file, that showed a
man identified as Nix wearing a robe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look like that might be a robe?'' Helfrich asked.
</P>
<P>
   Nix said it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got a hood on it?'' Helfrich asked.
</P>
<P>
   Nix acknowledged that it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holding a gun?'' Helfrich said, referring to the man in the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Nix did not deny any of it. Instead, he just said of the man in
the picture:
</P>
<P>
   ``That ain't me.''
</P>
<P>
   Helfrich asked Nix if he remembered something his wife said at
the time FBI agents seized the picture, in the spring of 1966.
According to court documents, Helfrich said, Nix's wife walked up
to him and said: ``They found that silly picture of you with the
pointed hood on.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of courtroom guffawed.
</P>
<P>
   Nix's credibility has already been questioned. After he was
arrested in May when state officials decided they had enough
evidence for one more trial, he told the presiding judge that his
health was bad and that he needed regular treatment. Several days
later, a news photographer took a picture of ``his backswing'' at a
golf course, Helfrich said.
</P>
<P>
   When Nix was ordered back before the judge, he had five golf
tees in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many fruit baskets did you deliver for the Klan?''
Helfrich here Thursday, sounding disgusted.
</P>
<P>
   Nix said none.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was interrupted at one point when Nix was apparently
having trouble breathing, presumably because his oxygen bottle had
to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   But when a private nurse carried the bottle from the room, it
hissed loudly from the pressure of the escaping oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   `` Nix,'' Helfrich asked him at one point in his testimony, ``do
you know what perjury is?''

UCLA'S McNOWN DIVES HEADFIRST INTO HYPE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cade McNown hit the beach with his UCLA teammates
Thursday. Somewhere in the Malibu surf, McNown shed his old skin
like a wet suit and braced himself for the numbing days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   For the next three months those will be man-made waves breaking
at McNown's feet, whipped into a froth by the winds of hype.
Starting with today's media gathering and Saturday's opening of
training camp, reporters will roll in and out like the tide, asking
the Bruins' senior quarterback about the Heisman Trophy that could
be his.
</P>
<P>
   The current will be unpredictable. And there's always a danger
the constant pounding will wear on McNown or that he'll get dragged
down by the powerful undertow of public opinion. The hope is that
he can hang on and enjoy the ride.
</P>
<P>
   After all, unless you're Archie Griffin, the Heisman race is a
once-in-a-lifetime experience. If you're Gino Torretta, it's the
last football high you experience. And as another former winner,
O.J. Simpson, can attest, there are far greater trials in life.
'Tis less taxing to tackle the endless question, ``Can you win the
Heisman?'' than ``Did you kill your ex-wife and her friend?''
</P>
<P>
   Before he won the award in 1968, Simpson, the former USC running
back, finished second in the balloting in 1967 behind UCLA
quarterback Gary Beban, the only Bruin to win college football's
highest individual honor. Over the past 10 years, nobody in the
Pacific-10 has come closer than USC quarterback Rodney Peete's
second-place finish in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a talent thing so much as it is a time thing. Outside
of insomniacs and sports addicts, West Coast football _ with its
glut of night games _ doesn't have a huge following east of the
Rockies. The last game the Bruins played in the Eastern time zone
was against Michigan at Ann Arbor in September of 1996. McNown,
then a sophomore, threw three interceptions in a 38-9 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, McNown has gained renown for outplaying Tennessee's
Peyton Manning in a game last year at the Rose Bowl. He finished
the 1997 season as the nation's leader in pass efficiency. So what
did he find when he flipped through a few preseason college
football publications recently?
</P>
<P>
   ``I read one article where it said I don't have a strong arm or
something,'' McNown said, ``and another that said I lack the will
to win. The most ridiculous? There was one that said I've been
really inconsistent and it used as an example the Michigan game
`debacle.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make McNown frown. His conclusion? Some would-be
Heisman voters have long and selective memories.
</P>
<P>
   To get people up to speed on McNown's skills, UCLA sports
information director Marc Dellins sent a three-minute highlight
reel from last season to a select group of writers from the East
and South regions.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the hype is pretty much in McNown's hands. Dellins
promises there will be no overkill to this Heisman campaign. Voters
won't be receiving weekly buttons or bumper stickers or coffee mugs
that say ``Vote McNow for Cade.''
</P>
<P>
   A season-opening home game Sept. 12 against Texas and Heisman
front-runner Ricky Williams should be enough to fan the flames for
these next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll come and that's fine,'' McNown said of the Heisman talk.
``I'll be very oblivious to a lot of the stuff that's being
written. As soon as you start thinking about the Heisman, you're
going to start sacrificing the team for your ego. All I'm going to
be trying to do every week is keep the team in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown's lack of pretension is so refreshing, he was voted a
team captain. That's a responsibility rarely bestowed upon a team's
resident superstar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the (stars) are really full of themselves,'' McNown
conceded. ``I find myself helping a lot of the receivers with their
routes and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown, 21, can do more than that _ and frankly, he must if the
Bruins are to live up to their No.7 preseason national ranking. By
opening himself up to the media blitz, he can deflect pressure from
the youngsters trying to take up where departed running back Skip
Hicks and receiver Jim McElroy left off.
</P>
<P>
   The way McNown, a four-year starter, ought to look at it is any
reporter pestering him is one who's not off hounding one of his
less experienced teammates. As he acknowledged during Pac-10 media
day, ``It's not like I've all-of-a-sudden been thrust into (the
limelight).''
</P>
<P>
   If it makes it any easier, McNown should turn the Heisman
question into a riddle. How many different ways can he say a lot of
nothing?
</P>
<P>
   There are enough comedic possibilities to put any of the
final-season ``Seinfeld'' episodes to shame. McNown has got his
timing down on the field, now all he's got to do is hone his
postgame delivery. What we'd give to have someone ask McNown, who
finished eighth in last year's Heisman balloting, about his
prospects and hear him say something like, ``Can I win the Heisman?
I sure hope so. I could use a 25-pound paperweight for my stack of
press clippings.''
</P>
<P>
   But first things first. McNown should go out and splurge on a
scrapbook that's thicker than any playbook. Because one day he
might look back on this as the best year of his life.

 &HT;    Honda earnings still on rise, thanks to U.S. sales
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Honda Motor Co., Japan's third-largest automaker,
continued its record earnings pace Thursday by reporting that
first-quarter group profits rose 25.7 percent as strong U.S. sales
made up for sinking car sales in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The company said group net income hit a record high $548 million
for the three-month period ended June 30, compared with last year's
first-quarter record of $427 million. Sales rose 12.4 percent to
$11 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Honda, which employs 13,000 workers at four Ohio plants, relies
on the U.S. market more than any other Japanese automaker, analysts
said. The U.S. accounts for almost half of Honda's revenue and more
than two-thirds of worldwide operating income, compared to half for
Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's biggest carmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Honda vehicle sales in North America climbed 8.3 percent to
265,000 units. In Japan, Honda sold only 185,000 autos, down 11.9
percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have been surprised at double digits (for the
increase in net profit) but this rise is very impressive,'' said
Jeremy Tonkin, an auto analyst at Towa Securities Co. Americans
flocked to Honda's CR-V, a small sport-utility vehicle, and the
Civic compact and Accord mid-sized sedans, long known for their
reliability and high resale value. Honda's sales in the U.S. grew
more than 12 percent in April and May compared with the same months
last year, while sales in June rose 7.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Accord has been among the best-selling car in the United
States, along with the Toyota Motor Corp.'s Camry.
</P>
<P>
   Honda's Ohio plants include a Marysville factory that makes the
Acura and
</P>
<P>
   Honda Accord; an East Liberty plant, which makes the Honda
Civic, an engine plant in Anna and a Marysville motorcycle factory.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's car market, the world's second largest, has been
crippled by the country's worst recession since World War II, with
industry-wide sales falling for 16 straight months and production
decreasing for nine months.

 &HT;    Strike-affected UAW workers will receive unemployment
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ About 30,000 United Auto Workers in Dayton and
across Ohio who were laid off earlier this summer because of two
crippling strikes against General Motors Corp. will receive
unemployment benefits for the time they missed work.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio Bureau of Employment Services on Thursday ruled that
the Ohio workers did not participate in the strikes at two GM parts
plants in Flint, Mich. between June 5 and July 28. The workers at
nine plants in Dayton, Lordstown, Mansfield, Parma, Defiance,
Toledo, Columbus and Sandusky were sent home because of a shortage
of parts.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was a section of Ohio law that prohibits benefits for
workers whose unemployment is due to any labor dispute other than a
lockout.
</P>
<P>
   The workers claimed they were exempt under a provision that
allows benefits for workers who are not financing or taking part in
a strike. They did not get strike benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had faith we would get the benefits all along, we think our
the people deserve them,'' said Gary Hill, president of UAW Local
696, which represents 3,400 hourly workers at two Dayton brake
plants.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the strike settlement with the UAW, GM promised not
to sell or close the two Delphi Chassis brake plants in Dayton
before January 2000. The plants have lost more than $40 million
over the last two years and Local 696 has been battling GM for the
plants' survival.
</P>
<P>
   GM had maintained that as dues-paying UAW members, the workers
are helping to finance the strike. And because the agency assesses
GM for unemployment benefits and keeps the money in a trust fund to
pay to workers who qualify, the company would have to replace any
money that is paid out to its workers.
</P>
<P>
   David Garick, OBES spokesman, said the benefits covered under
Thursday's ruling would be granted retroactively.
</P>
<P>
   The agency declined to offer further comment because the matter
may be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed in the decision,'' said Gerry Holmes, GM
spokesman. ``We thought we had a strong case ... that this was a
UAW-orchestrated situation.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dozens of U.S. cruise missiles struck targets in
Afghanistan and Sudan on Thursday in what President Clinton
described as an act of self-defense against imminent terrorist
plots and of fearsome retribution for the bombings of U.S.
embassies in East Africa two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes were launched from ships in the Arabian Sea and Red
Sea, executed under the cover of darkness with no U.S. casualties.
With 75 missiles aimed to explode simultaneously in unsuspecting
countries on two continents, the operation was the most formidable
U.S. military assault ever against a private sponsor of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The targets were identified by Pentagon officials as an
extensive terrorism training complex in Afghanistan, 94 miles south
of Kabul, and a factory for the building blocks of chemical weapons
near Khartoum, Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his national security team linked both sites to
Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi millionaire tied by U.S.
intelligence to the twin bombings on August 7 in Kenya and
Tanzania, which killed 12 Americans and nearly 300 Africans. Bin
Laden, who is in Afghanistan, apparently survived the attack, which
officials insisted was not aimed at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let our actions today send this message loud and clear,''
Clinton said in an address from the Oval Office. ``There are no
expendable American targets. There will be no sanctuary for
terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   The president made no apologies for ordering the strikes without
permission from Afghanistan or Sudan, saying that ``countries that
persistently host terrorists have no right to be safe havens.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton returned to the White House this afternoon from his
vacation on Martha's Vineyard, where he was trying to repair family
relations damaged by his admission Monday of an intimate
relationship with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said they had no immediate estimate of damage
or casualties, although Defense Secretary William Cohen said the
strikes were designed to ``cause sufficient damage to disrupt them
for some time.'' Sudanese television this afternoon broadcast
images of a ravaged, burning factory under a night sky stained
orange.
</P>
<P>
   The president presented several reasons for the decision to act
swiftly and forcefully, rather than to try to punish bin Laden
through means of diplomacy and law enforcement. Repeatedly, he said
that bin Laden presented an imminent threat, quoting his vow this
week to wage a war in which Americans were ``all targets.'' He
added that ``key terrorist leaders'' were believed to be gathering
at the compound in Afghanistan on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had ``convincing'' intelligence that bin Laden's
terrorist network was behind the embassy bombings. And he accused
groups tied to bin Laden of a host of murderous attacks and foiled
plots, from killing international peacekeepers in Somalia to
planning to assassinate the pope.
</P>
<P>
   But, while the Republican leadership rallied to support the
raids, some congressmen reacted suspiciously, noting that the
action followed by just three days Clinton's acknowledgement to the
public and a grand jury of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Administration officials scorned talk of any connection.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton's motorcade abruptly left the borrowed estate where
he was secluded with his wife and daughter, reporters and
photographers idling at the entrance assumed he was going to play
golf. They reluctantly abandoned the movie that they had begun to
watch, ``Wag the Dog,'' about a fictional president who
manufactures a phony war to distract the nation from an adulterous
liason.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton made a brief, dramatic appearance to announce
the strikes. Then, in a feat of unparalleled one-upsmanship after a
summer of jaw-dropping juxtapositions, Clinton flew to Washington
for his Oval Office address as Ms. Lewinsky was testifying for a
second time before the grand jury here.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that planning for the mission
began nine days ago, shortly after the embassy bombings August 7.
Clinton was first informed of the planning in the White House
situation room Aug. 12, and on Aug. 14 he gave tentative approval
for a mission. He gave the final go-ahead in a telephone
conversation at 3 a.m. Thursday morning with National Security
Adviser Samuel Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials denied any plan to assassinate bin Laden,
saying that they intended only to damage his network. But asked if
bin Laden was a legitimate military target, Cohen said, ``To the
extent that he and his organization have declared war upon the
United States or our interests, then he certainly is engaged in an
act of war.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Clinton warned Americans that the strike would by
no means put an end to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a long, ongoing struggle between freedom and
fanaticism, between the rule of law and terrorism,'' he said. ``We
must be prepared to do all that we can for as long as we must.
America is and will remain a target of terrorists precisely because
we are leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   The president was careful in his speech to stress that his
objection was to bin Laden, rather than to his religion, Islam. He
referred to bin Laden as ``the pre-eminent organizer and financier
of international terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing Islam as ``the faith of hundreds of millions of good
peace-loving people,'' Clinton said, ``Our actions were aimed at
fanatics and killers who wrap murder in the cloak of righteousness
and, in so doing, profane the great religion in whose name they
claim to act.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the news that the United States had bombed
terrorist targets swept through her midtown Manhattan office
Thursday, Valerie David felt a predictable knot of emotions: sorrow
for the loss of lives, concern about the precision of the attacks,
fear about where this would all lead.
</P>
<P>
   But it was threaded with what she described as a surreal, almost
comical sense of deja vu.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Wag the Dog','' Ms. David, a copy editor for Avon Products,
explained, stifling a chuckle. ``Everybody at the office was
talking about it _ how ironic it was that life was imitating art.
We all noticed it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, the president's handlers invent a war to distract
public attention from his sexual transgressions. In real life, was
the Clinton administration doing something similar?
</P>
<P>
   Cynical in the extreme, that was a question that some residents
of the New York region could not avoid asking themselves Thursday.
And it seemed to reflect not only the bizarre parallels between
fiction and fact, but also the profound distrust that some
Americans have begun to harbor toward a president who acknowledged
misleading the public.
</P>
<P>
   These Americans may well represent a minority. A random sampling
of opinions around the New York region yielded at least as many
people who said that the president's authorization of military
force in Afghanistan and the Sudan seemed wholly justified and that
the United States could never be too aggressive in its efforts to
stamp out and deter terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of those people who professed antipathy toward
President Clinton did not think he would stoop so far as to use
military maneuvers to divert people's attention from Monica S.
Lewinsky, the woman the president admitted to having had a
relationship that was ``not appropriate.'' ``I don't think he's
that much of a dimwit,'' said Lina Fetter, an accountant from
Morris Plains, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   But there were others for whom the timing of the bombings,
coming so fast on the heels of the president's televised address to
the country on Monday night, felt a little too tidy, a little too
cinematic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that popped into my mind was how convenient
this was,'' said Brian Cooper, an investment banking analyst who
works in midtown Manhattan. ``My brother called me to tell me what
had happened, and I said, `Doesn't this remind you of `Wag the
Dog'?''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel investigating the
Lewinsky matter, fielded a question about ``Wag the Dog'' from
reporters on the steps of a court house in Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I have seen it,'' Starr said with a chuckle. ``Other than
that, I'm not going to comment.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, mentioned the movie in his defense of
the president's actions Thursday. ``I don't think the President
would be foolish enough to do a `Wag the Dog','' he said, according
to the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Less charitable reactions could be found on the Internet, which
quickly sprouted jokes that cast President Clinton's actions as a
cunning ploy. In one, a pollster tells the president, ``Your speech
bombed. I'm being as candid as I can.'' The president then informs
an aide, ``It sounds like he said I should bomb Afghanistan.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind much of this lay the uneasy sense that in losing many
people's respect, the president and his administration had become
fair game for parody even on a day of grave international
developments.
</P>
<P>
   Roger DeWitt, an actor who was doing clerical tasks in his
agent's midtown Manhattan office Thursday, said that right after he
and the other workers in the office heard on television that the
president would be making a major announcement regarding national
security, they mentioned ``Wag the Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we all looked to see what tie he was wearing,'' DeWitt
said, riffing on news reports this week that Clinton had possibly
sent Ms. Lewinsky a message, through his choice of neckwear, on the
first day she testified to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Others spoke in more somber voices. Amanda Urban, a prominent
Manhattan literary agent, said that she immediately drew a
connection Thursday between ``Wag the Dog'' and the news reports
that she was hearing, but that she shuddered at the serious thought
she gave to the parallels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's downright scary that we have to consider the
possibility,'' Ms. Urban said. ``These are incredibly cynical
times.''

COWBOYS REACQUIRE WATKINS IN TRADE WITH BRONCOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS AND CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys traded for Kendell Watkins
yesterday, one year after releasing the blocking tight end for
salary-cap reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins was in the Denver Broncos' training camp after missing
all of 1997. The Cowboys gave up a conditional draft choice to
acquire Watkins, who has a three-year deal at the minimum $275,000
per season. Watkins could receive up to $100,000, depending on how
much he plays this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys made the move after scouting Watkins' progress with
the Broncos this summer. They intend to make him a blocking tight
end, putting him third on the depth chart behind David LaFleur and
Eric Bjornson.
</P>
<P>
   Reports indicated that the Cowboys released Watkins for defying
a club ban on Cowboys Cafe, a Valley Ranch restaurant. But Watkins'
agent, Brian Levy, said yesterday that Watkins was cut because of
salary considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had he made the team in 1997, the Cowboys would have had to
pay him a $180,000 reporting bonus,'' Levy said. ``It was a money
issue. Kendell was never at Cowboys Cafe after the Cowboys told him
not to go. But there were some turmoil-related incidents going on
at the time, and they figured that they would scare some of the
younger players,'' by letting people believe that Watkins had
violated a team policy.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins, 6-foot-1, 285 pounds, was a second-round draft choice
of the Cowboys in 1995. He suffered a season-ending knee injury in
the 1996 preseason. After missing last year, he was picked up by
the Broncos and played in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said the salary cap was one reason
Watkins was let go last season. While declining to comment on the
Cowboys Cafe ban, Jones did say that off-the-field concerns played
a part in his decision on Watkins, including Watkins' poor work
habits after a 1996 knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an overall decision,'' Jones said. ``The cap impact had
a lot to do with it.''
Four players back
Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said he expects four of the six players
who missed Monday night's preseason game to play tomorrow night in
St. Louis against the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said running backs Emmitt Smith (thigh bruise) and Chris
Warren (groin strain) were held out of Monday's 21-3 loss to the
New England Patriots because of concerns about the Azteca Stadium
field. Both have participated in practice this week and should have
no limitations in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Kavika Pittman, who has missed the exhibition game
against the Patriots and the scrimmage against the Saints because
of a sprained ankle, will start against the Rams.

   And deep snapper Dale Hellestrae, who did not make the trip to
Mexico City for the Patriots game because of the death of his
father, will return to the team today after missing the past two
days of practices. Gailey said Hellestrae will also play against
the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Deion Sanders (ribs) and defensive tackle Leon Lett
(knee sprain) won't play against the Rams. Gailey said both should
be ready for the season opener against the Arizona Cardinals on
Sept. 6.
Teague still in mix
Cowboys defensive coordinator Dave Campo said any speculation about
veteran safety George Teague being out of the running for the
starting free safety job is premature.
</P>
<P>
   A six-year veteran, Teague is battling second-year players Kenny
Wheaton and Omar Stoutmire. And considering that he has not started
in five outings so far, Teague looked to be the third man in the
race.
</P>
<P>
   Wheaton has started one preseason game and one scrimmage, while
Stoutmire has started two preseason games and one scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Campo, however, said the strategy had nothing to do with
Teague's ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what George can do,'' Campo said. ``We want to see
what the young guys can do against front-line people. The starter
could be any one of those guys.''
Two-position players
Campo said rookie defensive lineman Michael Myers, who was moved
from tackle to rush defensive end this week, is one of several
defensive linemen who are learning two positions.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve tackle Antonio Anderson also has worked at strongside
end, and backup strongside end Hurvin McCormack has worked at
tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Campo said that for depth purposes, he likes players who are
able to play two positions.
</P>
<P>
   Myers' move could be permanent if he continues to play the way
he has at tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just taking a look now, but he finds a way to get to
the ball,'' Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   Myers, who played end and tackle in college at the University of
Alabama, said he prefers end because there are fewer double teams,
but is willing to play anywhere to help the team.
Fourth child for Irvins
Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin missed part of practice yesterday
because his wife, Sandi, gave birth to their fourth child, a son.

WITNESS PAINTS KLAN AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION 
</HEADLINE>

 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   HATTIESBURG, Miss. _ Spectators here at the trial of a former
Klansman accused of ordering the murder of a respected civil rights
leader were surprised, to say the least, when another former
Klansman described the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of
Mississippi as a benevolent organization that existed to give money
to the rural poor and pass out fruit baskets at Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the older black people in the courtroom shook their
heads, some of them snickered and a few laughed out loud when
Deavours Nix, a defense witness and former Klansman, testified that
he never even heard the defendant, Samuel F. Bowers, use a racial
slur.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers, the Imperial Wizard who led the Mississippi White
Knights when the violent organization was linked to killings,
church burnings and beatings in the 1960s, stands accused for the
fifth time of ordering the murder of Vernon Dahmer, a black grocer
who was killed when his home was firebombed by Klansmen on Jan. 10,
1966. Both the prosecution and the defense wrapped up their cases
Thursday, with closing arguments scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Nix, who held the Klan title of ``State Investigator'' though he
said he does not know what that title means and he attended only
three or so Klan meetings, described Bowers, now 73, as a
``patriot'' who was respectful to ladies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not used profane language and I never heard him use a
racial slur,'' said Nix, who is accused of taking part in the
firebombing that killed Dahmer, a NAACP leader who was helping
blacks register to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Nix suffers from cancer and heart and lung ailments and
testified in a wheelchair with an oxygen bottle attached. He and
another former Klansman, Charles Noble, are expected to go on trial
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Nix testified Thursday that to his knowledge, Bowers was never
the leader of the Mississippi Klan, that the Klan did not stand for
violence and that he, himself, was never that much involved in it,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   He only joined, he said, because he heard that the Klan ``did
some benevolent work, such as delivering baskets of fruit at
Christmastime to people that was needy.'' He never had a robe, he
said. He did not hear racial slurs at the Klan meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But three former Klansmen who became government informers have
testified that Bowers planned and ordered Dahmer's murder at Klan
meetings in 1965. Bowers walked free, three decades ago, after
juries in four trials deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
   This trial has boiled down to the word of two factions: those
former Klansmen who described Bowers as a coldly racist leader who
masterminded the execution of Dahmer, paired against people who
were either members of the Klan or had Klan ties.
</P>
<P>
   The lead prosecutor, Robert Helfrich, picked apart Nix's
testimony one statement at a time, showing gaps in the truth that
had the courtroom laughing. For example, there was this exchange:
</P>
<P>
   ``What color was your robe,'' Helfrich asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have no robe,'' Nix said.
</P>
<P>
   Helfrich handed him a picture, from an FBI file, that showed a
man identified as Nix wearing a robe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look like that might be a robe?'' Helfrich asked.
</P>
<P>
   Nix said it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got a hood on it?'' Helfrich asked.
</P>
<P>
   Nix acknowledged that it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holding a gun?'' Helfrich said, referring to the man in the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Nix did not deny any of it. Instead, he just said of the man in
the picture:
</P>
<P>
   ``That ain't me.''
</P>
<P>
   Helfrich asked Nix if he remembered something his wife said at
the time FBI agents seized the picture, in the spring of 1966.
According to court documents, Helfrich said, Nix's wife walked up
to him and said: ``They found that silly picture of you with the
pointed hood on.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of courtroom guffawed.
</P>
<P>
   Nix's credibility has already been questioned. After he was
arrested in May when state officials decided they had enough
evidence for one more trial, he told the presiding judge that his
health was bad and that he needed regular treatment. Several days
later, a news photographer took a picture of ``his backswing'' at a
golf course, Helfrich said.
</P>
<P>
   When Nix was ordered back before the judge, he had five golf
tees in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many fruit baskets did you deliver for the Klan?''
Helfrich here Thursday, sounding disgusted.
</P>
<P>
   Nix said none.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was interrupted at one point when Nix was apparently
having trouble breathing, presumably because his oxygen bottle had
to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   But when a private nurse carried the bottle from the room, it
hissed loudly from the pressure of the escaping oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   `` Nix,'' Helfrich asked him at one point in his testimony, ``do
you know what perjury is?''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many an eye, on Wall Street and Main Street alike, is trained on
the Internet, seeking signs that its much-hyped promise as a
channel of retail commerce is beginning to be realized.
</P>
<P>
   The big breakthrough so far, the bookseller Amazon.com,
demonstrated that ordinary products not composed of chips and bits
can be successfully retailed over the Internet. And, perhaps more
important, it showed that investors see no need to wait for
consistent operating profits before betting heavily on a company
that may have found the key.
</P>
<P>
   So the old question of whether Internet retailing can work is
giving way to a new question: In which retail categories will the
next Amazons emerge?
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters say the stakes are high. Forrester Research, a
market research firm in Cambridge, Mass., expects the on-line
retail market to mushroom from $4.8 billion in sales in 1998 to
more than $17 billion in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But Forrester expects 86 percent of that trade to be in just
five categories, all of them already established on line:
Computers, software, entertainment, books and travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those industries that are most susceptible to on-line
retailing are already obvious,'' explained David Alschuler, an
electronic-commerce analyst at Aberdeen Group, a consulting firm in
Boston. The best candidates are those where consumers do a lot of
research before buying and want information that traditional sales
channels have a difficult time supplying, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Internet experts have already spotted opportunities for a
new round of on-line retailers.
</P>
<P>
   One company that may have its toe on the escalator is Etoys, a
year-old on-line toy retailer still in the venture-capital stage.
It sells about 3,000 products, according to Kate Delhagen, director
of on-line retail strategies at Forrester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Etoys has built up a good, customer-friendly front end of the
business,'' Ms. Delhagen said. ``And they've done a good job
matching inventory to logistics.''
</P>
<P>
   Another category that analysts are calling ripe for Internet
retailing is consumer electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies Inc., a consulting
firm in Campbell, Calif., sees Amazon's recent deal to acquire the
Junglee Corp. as giving it an important leg up in the field. For
comparison-shopping on the World Wide Web, Junglee offers consumers
a powerful search engine, one of the few ways to research consumer
electronics prices.
</P>
<P>
   The demographics certainly seem right. Consumer electronics
shoppers tend to be men with relatively high incomes _ among the
people most likely to use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But traditional electronics retailers like Circuit City and Best
Buy have so far been slow to step into cyberspace. And Nicole
Vanderbilt, director of digital commerce at Jupiter Communications,
an Internet consulting company in New York, said start-ups have a
difficult time breaking in because they lack the buying power of
larger retailers and must deal with a raft of distributors.
</P>
<P>
   So despite the large volume of computer products now sold on
line, ``no one yet has come forward and positioned themselves as a
category killer'' in other consumer electronics, Ms. Vanderbilt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some electronics retailers are moving ahead. In mid-June, Tops
Appliance City linked up with Cybershop International, a publicly
traded on-line retailer of luxury merchandise like Coach bags and
Mikasa crystal, to develop a new Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Bajarin saw rich opportunities for retailers of cameras.
``There's an amazing amount of comparison-shopping among
photography shoppers,'' he said, yet Web sites are often so
primitive that consumers must phone for prices.
</P>
<P>
   Discount buying clubs are another area that analysts say can do
well on the Internet. The leader so far is Net Market, a Cendant
subsidiary. But a competitor, Value America, has attracted
attention lately with heavy advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts also see apparel as gaining momentum on line,
despite clothing manufacturers' traditional slowness to adopt new
technology. Ms. Vanderbilt said one company with an early,
interesting niche is Pivot Rules Inc., formerly a maker of golf
clothing. In May it switched gears and began developing a Web site
called Bluefly, offering designer apparel at deep discounts.
</P>
<P>
   The company's chief executive, Kem Seiff, said the off-price
apparel business frustrated many consumers with hit-or-miss
excursions to stores full of chaotic clothing racks. And catalogue
companies struggle with the unpredictable availability of off-price
apparel.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are divided over the prospects for selling mundane
items like groceries over the Internet, offering widely divergent
revenue forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it will grow into billions of dollars eventually, but
not soon,'' said Ms. Delhagen of Forrester. ``And that's because
there's a very powerful dynamic at work. Even though we say we hate
grocery shopping, it's still very easy to do'' and typically does
not require a lot of research, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Peapod Inc., a pioneer in on-line grocery sales,
may expand nationwide only gradually because so many of its wares
are perishable. By contrast, Net Grocer Inc. concentrates on longer
shelf-life products and is expected to gain momentum.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-July, America Online agreed to make Netgrocer Inc. the
exclusive supermarket delivery service for its customers in
exchange for a $15 million fee over the next three years, a share
in ad and transaction revenues and warrants to buy Netgrocer stock.
This month, Netgrocer filed a registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission to go public.
</P>
<P>
   It's a short leap from groceries to drugstore sundries, and, so
far, the best-capitalized on-line entry seems to be Drugstore.Com,
a privately held company founded by a former Microsoft executive,
Peter Neupert.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vanderbilt of Jupiter thinks on-line sales make sense for
basic supplies that consumers often need to restock, like toilet
paper and soap. But drugstores' best profits are from goods that
are hard or impossible to sell on line: prescription drugs and
impulse purchases like cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart and Netgrocer already offer some drugstore items on
line, Ms. Vanderbilt said, but the selection is limited, and, in
Wal-Mart's case, not heavily promoted. ``We think there's an
opportunity here for a category killer like Amazon,'' she said.

 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The notes of a senior aide say that at a November
1995 White House meeting where the distinction between hard and
soft money was apparently discussed, Vice President Al Gore told
the others present to ``count me in'' on making fund-raising
telephone calls that are now the subject of a Justice Department
review on whether to seek the appointment of an independent
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's comment was recorded in handwritten notes by his deputy
chief of staff, David Strauss, that appear on several pages of a
White House memorandum that discussed the Democrats' ambitious
fund-raising strategy for the 1996 Clinton re-election campaign.
The memorandum was turned over to the Justice Department by the
White House about a month ago and has prompted prosecutors to begin
the process of deciding whether to seek an outside counsel to
investigate campaign finance abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The notes suggest that Gore may not have been candid in his
public statements on the subject of the phone calls. He has said
that he did not realize that some of the large contributions he
solicited in the fund-raising calls for use only for general
campaign purposes by the Democratic Party, such as registration
drives, would be diverted to ``hard money'' accounts which directly
financed such Clinton-Gore re-election devices as television ads.
</P>
<P>
   But Strauss' notes indicate that Gore may have known that there
was a distinction between ``hard money'' and ``soft money''
contributions because the subject appears to have been discussed at
the Nov. 21, 1995, meeting attended by President Clinton, Gore and
senior campaign officials.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss wrote ``65 percent soft, 35 percent hard,'' an apparent
reference to the division of contributions between hard and soft
money accounts. In his small neat hand, Strauss jotted a shorthand
definition of soft money as ``corporate or anything over $20K from
an individual.''
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly narrow question of whether Gore knew the
distinction between hard and soft money is significant because
Attorney General Janet Reno has said that telephone solicitations
for the reelection effort, or hard money, by the president or vice
president were subject federal campaign finance laws and could be
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Reno refused to seek an outside prosecutor to
investigate Gore's phone calls, in effect clearing him of
wrongdoing because she had found no evidence that he had known that
money from any of his calls had been diverted to hard money
accounts. But early this month the notes forced her to reconsider
her decision, law enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that Gore was recently questioned for about a
half hour by Justice Department investigators. But his aides said
he would ultimately be exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever this process ends and at whatever stage, we are
confident that it will show that everything the vice president did
was legal and proper,'' said a Gore spokesman, Christopher Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has until the end of the month to decide whether to advance
from a 30-day initial review of the Gore telephone calls to a more
intensive 90-day inquiry that will determine whether she refers the
case to an independent prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials are said to be divided about the
importance of Strauss' notes, a few sentences written on the
five-page memorandum. Some doubt that the notations alone are
sufficient to prompt Reno to seek an independent prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   But, the officials said, the notes are likely to be considered
as part of a larger independent-counsel review under way at the
Justice Department as a result of a report to Reno by Charles La
Bella before he left as head of her campaign finance investigative
team.
</P>
<P>
   La Bella urged Reno to reconsider her refusal to refer the
campaign finance case to an independent prosecutor. He argued that
the Justice Department could not credibly investigate political
fund-raising efforts made on behalf of an incumbent president. La
Bella based his conclusions on a review of the evidence amassed
during the Justice Department's 18-month-old grand jury inquiry.

IN EXECUTIVE DIVORCE, WHO GETS CUSTODY OF THE OPTIONS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 23) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Minn., Conn., Texas, Calif., Ind., S.C., Wis.,
Ill.)   (af)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kim Hislop vividly remembers sitting with her husband, John, on
the deck of their home in Hyannis, Mass., one day in 1993. She
recalls him referring to the stock options being dangled by Telex
Communications Group, a maker of communications products, which was
recruiting him for chief financial officer at the company
headquarters in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be our brass ring,'' Mrs. Hislop recalls him
saying of the options to buy 12,000 Telex shares. And, indeed, it
was quite a payoff: When the company redeemed those options in a
recapitalization prompted by a takeover last year by Greenwich
Street Capital Partners, a private equity fund based in New York,
the stake was worth an estimated $5.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hislops, who had been married 22 years, divorced in 1994
and are now battling over some of these options, which represented
the couple's biggest asset. ``Now he wants it to be his brass
ring,'' said Mrs. Hislop, 49, a homemaker and mother who was
awarded nearly $2 million of the options but has sought a 50-50
split, or about $800,000 more. The dispute, she said, ``is about a
woman's contribution to marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Hislop would not comment on the case. His lawyer, Alan Eidsness,
said: ``These were options that Hislop had to earn by continuing to
do a good job. They were for future performance. If he didn't work,
he didn't get them.''
</P>
<P>
   Such battles are increasingly common now that stock options have
become almost as ubiquitous in corporate America as casual Fridays.
Since they are a form of deferred compensation _ giving the holder
the right to buy stock at a set price, no matter how high it rises
_ options have historically not been recognized as a marital asset.
</P>
<P>
   But with no federal law to govern the issue, it is being
thrashed out in state courts across the country. The most notable
case was decided this spring, when Lorna Wendt was awarded $20
million by a Connecticut court in a case dealing in part with the
General Electric options of Gary Wendt, her former husband and
chief executive of GE Capital.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to determine just how often stock options are
coming up in divorce proceedings, but Michael McCurley, a Dallas
lawyer who is president of the American Academy of Matrimonial
Lawyers, called them ``more and more an item of property
division.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock options now figure in about 85 percent of his cases these
days, he said, about twice the proportion 10 years ago. About
three-quarters are negotiated in settlements, he added, while the
rest are litigated.
</P>
<P>
   In California's Silicon Valley, where shares in fledgling
companies often loom larger than paychecks in household assets,
``it's becoming an increasing bone of contention'' in divorce
cases, said Lynne Yates-Carter, a lawyer in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   In California, at least, the law is settled: Options are
included among employee benefits that can be considered a household
asset. As a result, James Cox, family court settlement officer for
Santa Clara Court, said, ``there is no end'' to the type of option
deals he has seen, adding that he handles about 250 divorce cases
annually that involve options.
</P>
<P>
   In other states, though, much remains unsettled. First, the
court must agree that options are an asset to be divided; courts in
Indiana, South Carolina and Wisconsin have ruled that their
statutes do not provide for such treatment. Elsewhere, agreement is
emerging that stock options are an asset as subject to distribution
in a divorce settlement as, say, a house.
</P>
<P>
   The next issue is whether the options were acquired during the
marriage. While that may seem a simple matter, determining the
calendar of an option's award is a vast and poorly charted legal
battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   For example, an executive may be ``vested'' _ meaning that the
option has been awarded _ well before the start of divorce
proceedings. But the option may not have ``matured,'' or reached
the date when it may be exercised. And its terms may provide for
exercise at a price below the market _ making it immediately
profitable _ or at a higher price that the stock would presumably
reach sometime in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Courts have looked to vesting schedules to determine whether
certain options should be considered marital property. But case law
around the country is now focusing more on the purpose for which
the options were issued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, the date on which a stock option matures is
irrelevant to the purpose for which the option was granted,'' said
Linda A. Olup, a lawyer in Edina, Minn., representing Mrs. Hislop
in her appeal. ``What is important is why the stock option was
granted in the first place, as that determines whether it is
marital or nonmarital property.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from determining the company's intent _ which may well be
some unquantified blend of reward and incentive _ another problem
is calculating the value of particular options, which by their
nature involve an unknowable future.
</P>
<P>
   How, for instance, can a meaningful value be placed on the right
_ granted but not matured _ to buy 10,000 shares of a software
company in 2008, no matter the exercise price?
</P>
<P>
   ``Valuing a stock option is absurdly difficult,'' said Douglas
K. Fejer, a Dallas expert in business evaluation, particularly of
private companies.
</P>
<P>
   Others disagree. Ross Zimmerman, an executive compensation
specialist at Hewitt Associates, a consulting firm in Lincolnshire,
Ill., has helped devise option plans for hundreds of big companies.
``There is some intrinsic value'' to options on the date of their
grant, he said. ``The rule of thumb,'' he added ``is that the
initial value of an option is about one-third its ultimate value.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to avoid being hauled into divorce court, many companies
are redrawing agreements to try to make it clear that options are
linked to future efforts of the recipients.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hislop case, Mrs. Hislop contended that the Telex options
were not for future performance, but a signing bonus to induce her
husband to join the company; thus, she argued, they were marital
property of which she should get 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Through his lawyer, however, Hislop said his options were an
incentive for superior, continued performance _ in effect, golden
handcuffs tying him to the company's future, most of which would be
after his marriage ended.
</P>
<P>
   Telex officials were never asked to explain the rationale behind
the options. Among other documents, Mrs. Hislop did submit copies
of the offer of employment that her former husband received, which
outlined the options for which he would be eligible. Last week, the
company declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The trial judge did not rule on the company's rationale for the
award but relied on the vesting schedule for the options, which
were not fully matured by the time of the divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Kim Hislop's appeal for a larger share of the options
was denied; Ms. Olup, the appellate lawyer, said her client was
considering whether to file an appeal to the Minnesota Supreme
Court.

   LONGYEARBYEN, Norway _ Five gravediggers from London were
scheduled to started digging here Friday morning. Actually, much of
the time they will be hammering through ice.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the islands of Spitsbergen in the high Arctic between
mainland Norway and Greenland, the ground three feet down is always
frozen in permafrost. At six feet, they should find the bodies, in
the mass grave encased in a tomb of ice.
</P>
<P>
   It is the time of the midnight sun. A white fox slinks up the
steep hill overlooking this small mining town, its camouflage coat
useless now against the bare rock and dark moss. The seed-fluff
from the arctic cottongrass floats on the breeze among the rows of
white wooden crosses.
</P>
<P>
   Over the mass grave, a tent with a special air lock has been
stretched and inflated. The tent is for privacy in this somber
enterprise and protection against anything possibly dangerous
escaping into the outside air. Inside, the diggers, with medical
scientists at their side, will go about their business of opening
the resting place of seven young men who were buried here 80 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   This is a critical moment in one of the most ambitious efforts
yet to solve an intractable medical mystery: What caused the
influenza pandemic of 1918 and early 1919? Why was this particular
contagion so virulent that it killed an estimated 20 million to 40
million people worldwide?
</P>
<P>
   The secret of one of the most lethal viruses the world has ever
known may dwell in the lungs of these seven victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years' work culminates in the next few weeks,'' Dr.
Kirsty Duncan, who is directing the project, said as final
preparations were under way. She specializes in medical geography
and teaches at the universities of Windsor and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by reading ``America's Forgotten Pandemic: The
Influenza Of 1918,'' (Cambridge University Press) by Alfred W.
Crosby of the University of Texas, she began the search for flu
victims whose bodies might be preserved in ice. The research led
scientists to the mass grave in the cemetery here.
</P>
<P>
   In a diary kept by the coal mining company here, Dr. Duncan
found the names of the seven men, 18 to 29 years old, farmers and
fishermen who had just arrived here to earn extra money at winter
jobs in the mine. But they had contracted flu on the boat trip from
the mainland and died in the first week of October 1918.
</P>
<P>
   The sight of their names on the six crosses and one headstone at
the back of the cemetery moved Dr. Duncan to tears: Johan Bjerk,
William Henry Richardsen, Ole Kristofferson, Magnus Gabrielson,
Tormod Albrigtsen, Hans Hansen and Kristian Hansen.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Duncan impressed Norwegian authorities with the importance
of the project of isolating and describing at last the unknown 1918
virus. She emphasized the safety precautions that would be taken.
The authorities then obtained permissions from the families to
exhume and examine six of the seven bodies (all but
Kristofferson's).
</P>
<P>
   By the time the permissions came through, Dr. Duncan had
gathered an international group of pathologists, virologists,
molecular biologists, geologists and medical archeologists for the
work.
</P>
<P>
   A survey with ground-penetrating radar established that the
bodies, side by side, were in permanent permafrost and thus should
be well preserved for medical study. A team of experienced
gravediggers from Necropolis Co. in London was hired.
</P>
<P>
   After the topsoil is removed by spade and the permafrost is
penetrated with electric jack hammer, Dr. Charles R. Smith, a
pathologist from the Hospital for Sick Children at the University
of Toronto, plans to remove samples of tissues from the victims'
lungs, intestines and other organs. The bodies, which were not
embalmed, will not be thawed or taken from the grave, both out of
respect and as a precaution against the spread of any infectious
material.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists seriously doubt that any of the flu virus will
still be alive, but just in case, they will be wearing modified
space suits with self-contained breathing apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   Once the tissues are extracted, portions of each sample will be
sealed in separate vials and shipped to laboratories in Norway,
Canada, Britain and the United States. The most sensitive
investigations will be conducted at the U.S. Army's infectious
disease research laboratory in Fort Detrick, Md. and the National
Institute of Medical Research in London, which are equipped to
maintain the highest levels of biological containment of unknown
organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Bergan of the University of Oslo, a virologist on the
team, said the tissue samples would not be touched until they
arrived at the laboratories. ``Our first obligation is safety
requirements against the risk of contamination,'' Bergan said. ``We
want to make sure there is no viable virus in the sample and, if
there is, protect against its escape into the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergan said the research might help determine the composition,
genetic structure and nature of the 1918 virus, in particular its
exterior surfaces, where the virus attaches itself to the lining of
the lungs and the upper respiratory tract. Such knowledge could
lead to the development of a vaccine against this acute form of
influenza and tests and modifications of current or new anti-viral
drugs for treating the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The pandemic occurred near the close of World War I, when
doctors had yet to learn that influenza is caused by a virus and
they had no antibiotics to treat bacterial infections like
pneumonia that often attacked the weakened bodies and contributed
to death.

 LONGYEARBYEN, Norway: to death.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists in the project said it might take several months,
maybe a year, of analysis before they would be ready to publish
their findings.
</P>
<P>
   Their undertaking comes at a time when the search for the 1918
virus has gained momentum on several fronts. Last year, Dr. Jeffrey
K. Taubenberger, a biologist at the Armed Forces Institute of
Pathology in Washington, reported finding viral fragments in
preserved lung tissue of two U.S. soldiers who died of flu in World
War I. The specimens were in a collection of autopsy tissue, soaked
in formaldehyde and encased in paraffin, that the Army has kept
since the Civil War. The analysis of the material has enabled the
scientists to map at least one of the virus' protein-making genes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Johan Hultin, a retired pathologist who lives in San
Francisco, went to the tundra of Alaska last year and exhumed the
well preserved body of an Eskimo woman who died of the 1918 flu. He
sent lung tissue samples to Taubenberger, who was able to isolate
more viral traces.
</P>
<P>
   These findings encouraged Dr. Duncan's team in the belief that
it would also find traces of flu viruses in permafrost burials. But
for a time, Dr. Duncan wondered if there was any point in
continuing in light of the Taubenberger successes. At a meeting
with officials at the federal Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta, she was persuaded to press on.
</P>
<P>
   The project is supported by a $150,000 grant from the National
Institutes of Health in the United States and about $194,000 from
Hoffmann-La Roche, the pharmaceutical company.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Duncan emphasized the need for still more samples from other
parts of the world, especially material that has not been preserved
and possibly altered in formaldehyde.
</P>
<P>
   So head gravedigger Roger Webber is ready. He has been exhuming
bodies for 33 years, but has never worked in permafrost. It cannot
be harder than the many times he has dealt with layers of solid
chalk or limestone, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Using a technique known as needle biopsy, the pathologist,
Smith, will take bore samples of tissue from the lungs of the six
bodies. Then he will try to probe the hearts, where he may be able
to extract frozen blood. This is a long shot, but any blood could
yield samples of serum and any antibodies produced in the acute
phases of the disease. The intestines could hold bacteria, possible
clues to other complicating infections. An attempt will also be
made to get samples from the livers and spleens.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Smith said, ``You don't know what you are going to find
until you look.''
</P>
<P>
   The search for the 1918 influenza virus has apparently created
little stir in Spitsbergen. The 1,300 residents of Longyearbyen,
the island's principal community, are used to visitors with
peculiar goals in mind. Explorers like Richard E. Byrd and Roald
Amundsen set out from here in 1929 for the North Pole, about 700
miles away, and more recently, scientists have been operating bases
for studies in geophysics, climatology and polar life in the
Svalbard Archipelago, which includes Spitsbergen.
</P>
<P>
   Ann-Kristin Olsen, governor of the Svalbard Archipelago, said
that community meetings have been held to inform people of the
exhumations, and they had seemed to accept the reassurances that
the work posed no health hazard. Hallvard Holm, headmaster of the
local school, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard of a single soul who has been afraid,'' Holm
said. ``I know there have been jokes, nothing more.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the people of Spitsbergen and the tourists have more
familiar dangers on their minds. Each day hikers head off for the
rugged hills and glaciers with packs on their backs and rifles
slung over their shoulders. People are advised to carry a firearm
whenever they roam beyond town, in case they should meet up with a
hungry polar bear.

   Autodesk to Buy Discreet, Maker Of Movie Magic &QL; 
 &QL; 
By Benny Evangelista &QC; 
 &QL; 
Design software-maker Autodesk Inc. yesterday agreed to buy movie
special effects wizard Discreet Logic Inc. in a deal worth about
$531 million.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition, expected to close by the end of the year, will
merge Montreal's Discreet Logic, which helped sink the Titanic in
this year's movie blockbuster, with Kinetix, the Autodesk
subsidiary that bedeviled television's Ally McBeal with an animated
3-D baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are executing our strategy to broaden our business and
expand beyond the traditional design software category,'' Autodesk
chief executive Carol Bartz said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
   Autodesk, the world's fourth-largest PC computer software-maker,
is best known for computer-aided design programs used by architects
and engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday it reported net income of $9.1 million (18 cents per
share) on revenues of $186.6 million for the second quarter ended
July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues for the San Rafael company increased 21 percent from
$154.1 million in the second quarter of 1997, but net income was
down from $17.8 million (34 cents) due to a onetime charge related
to Autodesk's acquisition of German software-maker Genius in May.
</P>
<P>
   Autodesk agreed to issue 0.525 share of its own common stock in
exchange for each share of Discreet Logic stock.
</P>
<P>
   Both the earnings and the acquisition were announced after the
market closed. Shares in Autodesk rose 13 cents to $32.63, while
Discreet Logic shares rose $2.38 to $16. Both companies are traded
on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will expand Autodesk's reach into the entertainment
world, said Jim Guerard, vice president and general manager of
Kinetix.
</P>
<P>
   Kinetix has 130 employees worldwide including about 100 in San
Francisco. In addition to developing the computerized dancing baby,
it also designed software used to create special effects on films
like ``Lost in Space`` and graphics for CBS' television coverage of
the Nagano Winter Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Discreet is a 350-employee company that makes hardware systems
and software used for post-production movie special effects on
blockbusters like ``Titanic,'' ``Independence Day'' and ``Forest
Gump,'' said analyst Byron Berry of Yorkton Securities in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was a positive move for the companies and should allow
Discreet to eventually branch into lower cost systems aimed at the
consumer market, Berry said. For example, if the price came down
enough, consumers might use the company's products to edit their
own videos.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The new subsidiary will be called Discreet Logic and be
headquartered in Montreal. Current Discreet Logic President Richard
Szalwinski will head the merged operation.
</P>
<P>
   Guerard said the company plans to keep the present employees of
both Discreet and Kinetix located in Montreal and San Francisco
respectively, but acknowledged the merger may cause some
reductions.
</P>
<P>
   He said the companies have worked together for the past year on
different projects and the merger ``is a natural evolution of the
path we've been on for nine to 12 months.''

 Chevron could be jumping on the merger bandwagon   By Kenneth Howe  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
As industry experts mull British Petroleum's plan to buy Chicago's
Amoco Corp. for $49 billion, one thing seems clear: It's only a
matter of time before other big oil companies seek merger partners.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether San Francisco's Chevron Corp. will be a player is less
certain, but many analysts think it will.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd better be looking or they'll be left behind,'' said
Fadel Gheit, oil analyst with Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Gheit and other analysts believe that last week's deal _ which
would be the biggest foreign acquisition of a U.S. firm _ is a
signal that the oil industry is about to undergo the same
consolidation sweeping the telecommunications, banking, auto and
entertainment industries.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Chevron is mum about its plans. To those who ask,
the nation's fourth-largest oil company issues a purposely vague
statement: ``The BP/Amoco merger does not change our plans and will
not have any impact on our ability to execute those plans and
deliver value to our shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   The company refused to disclose whether its plans include
looking for a merger partner.
</P>
<P>
   But many industry watchers think Chevron will indeed seek a
partner and may have to move quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The logic behind Chevron jumping on the acquisition bandwagon
goes something like this. The proposed merger of BP and Amoco
creates a tier of three so-called ``super major'' oil companies,
based on proven oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
   At the top is Royal Dutch Shell with 19 billion barrels,
followed by BP Amoco with 14.6 billion and Exxon at 13 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Lagging far behind are second-tier companies such as Mobil and
Chevron at 6.9 billion barrels and 6.2 billion respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, these experts believe, only the super majors will
have the financial wherewithal to take on new oil discovery and
development projects.
</P>
<P>
   And even these super majors will be pitted against an emerging
new player, the state-owned oil company. From Brazil's Petrobras SA
to the Chinese National Petroleum Co., state-owned oil companies
are beginning to venture outside their borders to compete for
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they aren't careful, the second-tier oil companies are
going to find they aren't big enough to get invited to the party,''
said Gheit.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts think Chevron may have to move fast as the search
for merger partners heats up. For example, Texaco would be a
logical partner for Chevron. But Mobil, another possible partner,
may already be considering joining forces with Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron and Texaco are already 50-50 partners in Caltex
Petroleum Corp, a refining and marketing joint venture that covers
Asia, the Pacific, the Middle East and southern and eastern Africa.
</P>
<P>
   None of the companies would comment on its plans.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, whatever Chevron decides to do, it won't be out of any
particular financial weakness. One of the world's largest oil
companies, and one that traces its origins in California back to
1879, Chevron and its 34,000 employees pulled in revenues of $40
billion last year earning $3.3 billion, a 25 percent increase from
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, lower oil prices hurt profits during the past
quarter and Chevron's stock price has slipped somewhat. It traded
yesterday at $80.50, down 19 cents, well below its 52-week high of
$90.19.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers think that Chevron is more likely to be an
acquirer than a target. That's because it is so large that few
other oil concerns could afford to buy it. Those that are big
enough, such as Exxon Corp., have made it clear in public
statements that they are not interested in expanding further.
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts don't see that the strategic choices for
Chevron in such stark terms as a big acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mergers are going to happen, but getting bigger isn't
essential,'' said Matt Sagers, head of the energy division for
PlanEcon Inc., a Washington, D.C., consulting group.
</P>
<P>
   Sagers said companies like Chevron may start fine tuning their
operations. They may shed under-performing division, much as
Chevron said it would do earlier this week when it announced it
would sell its Pittsburg &AMP; Midway Coal Mining Co. subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Or, Sagers added, oil companies may form other strategic
alliances such as last year's deal to merge Royal Dutch/Shell's
U.S. refining and marketing operations with those of Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the lure to merge can be compelling, said Severin
Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at the University of
California at Berkeley, though he wasn't speaking specifically
about Chevron.
</P>
<P>
   Borenstein noted that oil prices are at their lowest level in a
decade with Brent crude in London at under $12 a barrel, compared
with nearly twice that a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been that the value of oil company assets _ the
crude they hold in the ground _ has gone down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these companies are taking a wealth hit, just as
consumers would if the price of their house declined,'' Borenstein
said. ``So they are thinking long and hard about efficiencies.''
</P>
<P>
   The response to lower crude prices by many oil companies has
been to cut costs. And one way to do that is merge and consolidate,
which can lead to large staff reductions from overlapping
operations.
</P>
<P>
   One industry rule of thumb, according to Gheit of Fahnestock is
that, on average, each employee laid off can save a company
$100,000 in salary, benefit and overhead costs such as travel,
training and office space expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies will salivate over those kinds of cost savings,'' he
said.

 Autodesk to Buy Discreet, Maker Of Movie Magic   By Benny Evangelista  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Design software-maker Autodesk Inc. yesterday agreed to buy movie
special effects wizard Discreet Logic Inc. in a deal worth about
$531 million.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The acquisition, expected to close by the end of the year, will
merge Montreal's Discreet Logic, which helped sink the Titanic in
this year's movie blockbuster, with Kinetix, the Autodesk
subsidiary that bedeviled television's Ally McBeal with an animated
3-D baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are executing our strategy to broaden our business and
expand beyond the traditional design software category,'' Autodesk
chief executive Carol Bartz said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
   Autodesk, the world's fourth-largest PC computer software-maker,
is best known for computer-aided design programs used by architects
and engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday it reported net income of $9.1 million (18 cents per
share) on revenues of $186.6 million for the second quarter ended
July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues for the San Rafael company increased 21 percent from
$154.1 million in the second quarter of 1997, but net income was
down from $17.8 million (34 cents) due to a onetime charge related
to Autodesk's acquisition of German software-maker Genius in May.
</P>
<P>
   Autodesk agreed to issue 0.525 share of its own common stock in
exchange for each share of Discreet Logic stock.
</P>
<P>
   Both the earnings and the acquisition were announced after the
market closed. Shares in Autodesk rose 13 cents to $32.63, while
Discreet Logic shares rose $2.38 to $16. Both companies are traded
on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will expand Autodesk's reach into the entertainment
world, said Jim Guerard, vice president and general manager of
Kinetix.
</P>
<P>
   Kinetix has 130 employees worldwide including about 100 in San
Francisco. In addition to developing the computerized dancing baby,
it also designed software used to create special effects on films
like ``Lost in Space`` and graphics for CBS' television coverage of
the Nagano Winter Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Discreet is a 350-employee company that makes hardware systems
and software used for post-production movie special effects on
blockbusters like ``Titanic,'' ``Independence Day'' and ``Forest
Gump,'' said analyst Byron Berry of Yorkton Securities in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was a positive move for the companies and should allow
Discreet to eventually branch into lower cost systems aimed at the
consumer market, Berry said. For example, if the price came down
enough, consumers might use the company's products to edit their
own videos.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The new subsidiary will be called Discreet Logic and be
headquartered in Montreal. Current Discreet Logic President Richard
Szalwinski will head the merged operation.
</P>
<P>
   Guerard said the company plans to keep the present employees of
both Discreet and Kinetix located in Montreal and San Francisco
respectively, but acknowledged the merger may cause some
reductions.
</P>
<P>
   He said the companies have worked together for the past year on
different projects and the merger ``is a natural evolution of the
path we've been on for nine to 12 months.''

STUART REGEN, 39, ART DEALER, FILM PRODUCER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating to correct spelling of slug)  (bl) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stuart Regen, a Los Angeles art dealer who also helped develop
the Oscar-winning movie ``Leaving Las Vegas,'' died Aug. 18 at a
hospital in Los Angeles. He was 39 and lived in West Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   He had been battling non-Hodgkin's lymphoma for nearly a decade,
his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Regen was born in 1959 in New York City and was a graduate of
Skidmore College, where he studied arts administration. His
interest in art stemmed partly from that of his mother, Barbara
Gladstone, who opened her own gallery in New York City in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Regen's first job in the art world was chief preparator at PS 1,
an alternative space in Long Island City, Queens. In 1985 and '86,
he worked briefly as an assistant at a gallery in Cologne, Germany,
and then moved to Los Angeles, working as director of the Fred
Hoffman Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1989, five weeks after he was diagnosed with cancer,
he opened his own gallery in West Hollywood. At first he
concentrated on artists from New York and Europe, some represented
by his mother, whose work was not well known in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 he married Shaun Caley, who became his business partner.
In 1992, as the art market waned, the couple relocated to a smaller
space next door to the gallery, which they renamed Regen Projects.
They began to focus on Los Angeles artists like Lari Pittman and
Charles Ray, as well as such emerging artists as Toba Khedoori,
Laura Owens, Catherine Opie, Frances Stark and Jennifer Pastor, who
were often showing their work for the first time. The couple gave
New York sculptor and filmmaker Matthew Barney his first gallery
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles stimulated Regen's interests in the movies. In the
early 1990s, after reading ``Leaving Las Vegas,'' a
semi-autobiographical novel by John O'Brien, he met with the
writer, optioned the book and contacted his friend Mike Figgis, who
eventually directed the award-winning 1995 movie based on the book.
Regen was credited as associate producer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife and his mother, Regen is survived by his
grandmother, Evelyn Leavitt of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and two
brothers, David and Richard, both of Manhattan.

FOREIGN TURMOIL DRIVES INVESTORS FROM DOW TO TREASURIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Please note that tilde in parentheses has been used in the

non-transmittable to some newspaper systems.)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Turmoil in overseas economies sent investors fleeing
stocks for the safety of bonds Thursday, pushing the yield on the
30-year Treasury bond to another new low.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that Russian bank failures were imminent and that
Venezuela might be forced to devalue its currency, the
bol(tilde)ivar, to combat a growing budget deficit, and persistent
concerns about a similar move by China buoyed the Treasury market.
All of these things added to investor concerns that the financial
crises among emerging markets might be spreading.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, an announcement by President Clinton that the
United States had bombed suspected terrorist camps in Afghanistan
and the Sudan in retaliation for the bombings at U.S. embassies in
East Africa earlier this month contributed to a strong rally in
Treasuries in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of disturbing things going on around the
world,'' said Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities
Company International. ``In that type of environment, the Treasury
market is the best place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The migration to the Treasury market hurt stock prices, which
fell for a second day after a rally earlier in the week. Analysts
cautioned that further declines were possible.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the dollar fell for the fourth consecutive day
against the yen, reflecting fears that the Japanese government
would sell dollars to defend the yen's value.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 81.87 points, to 8,611.41.
Financial services companies like American Express and J.P. Morgan
led the declines. The drop in those shares reflected investor
concerns that Venezuela's plight might hurt other Latin American
economies and jeopardize bank holdings of emerging-market debt as
well as repayment of loans made to those countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 6.46 points, to 1,091.60.
The Nasdaq, led by declines in the chip-related stocks Intel and
Applied Materials, lost 10.24 points, to 1,832.45.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year Treasury bond's price rose 21/32 to 99 28/32, which
means bond investors gained about $6.56 for each $1,000 of bonds
they held.
</P>
<P>
   The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price,
fell to 5.51 percent from 5.55 percent. The yield is now at its
lowest level since the Treasury Department began issuing the bonds
on a regular basis in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The strength in the bond market may last a while. Analysts said
one sign of its stamina is that long-term bond yields have been
below 5.60 percent for six consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many analysts say that bond yields can fall
further, causing the Treasury yield curve to flatten even more as
the spread between long-term yields and those on shorter-term
Treasury securities narrows. A flattening yield curve can be an
indication that interest rates will fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually expect that to happen,'' said Kathleen Camilli,
director of economic research at Tucker Anthony, a regional
brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Camilli says the long bond's yield could fall to 5 percent
this year. At that level, the yield would fall below the current
Federal Funds target rate, a benchmark for short-term interest
rates, now at 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move might prompt the Federal Reserve to lower short-term
interest rates, she forecast.
</P>
<P>
   At present, yields on shorter-term Treasury securities, like the
10-year and 2-year notes, are already below 5.5 percent. Ms.
Camilli and several other economists said that indicates that
investors believe that the next move by the Federal Reserve will be
to lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   If Treasury yields fall further, it might send investors rushing
back to stocks, said Anthony Conroy, a managing director at Bankers
Trust Global Investment Management. At much lower yield levels,
investors might decide that they can get a higher return by
investing in stocks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lower interest rates also translate into lower borrowing costs
for corporations and ease pressure on corporate profit margins, he
said.

SEVERAL AFC TEAMS HAVE LEGITIMATE CHAMPIONSHIP HOPES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the past decade and a half, the AFC's Powers That Be haven't
been powers at all _ at least not come Super Bowl time.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with the Denver Broncos providing a one-game winning
streak, the AFC contenders can consider their chances for a ring
that represents more than just a conference title. For the first
time in seemingly forever, the Powers That Be in the AFC are actual
powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you come in and say you want to get there, but it's
not very realistic,'' New England Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe
says. ``Every team in the NFL is optimistic this time of year. But
I think we have reason to be optimistic. The Super Bowl is a very
realistic goal for us.''
</P>
<P>
   And realistic for at least five AFC clubs, each of which has a
reasonable chance _ based both on what underdog Denver did to NFC
power Green Bay in the Super Bowl and on how strong they look on
paper _ of outperforming any club from the traditionally stronger
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The argument making the rounds this preseason seems to be that
beyond the Packers, the five best teams in the AFC (Denver,
Pittsburgh, Jacksonville, Kansas City and New England) are more
potent than their counterparts in the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   The mighty have fallen from the 33-19 interconference record in
1991 to a 32-28-1 AFC advantage last season. The mighty _
traditional powers Dallas and San Francisco _ are in transition,
and the rest of the hopefuls (the New York Giants, Tampa Bay,
Minnesota, Detroit, Washington, Atlanta and Philadelphia) remain
essentially unproven.
</P>
<P>
   But before anointing a team such as the Steelers as a power,
perhaps it's best to ask the Steelers themselves about the shift in
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're one of the best teams,'' says running back Jerome
Bettis. ``But we have too many questions. Until we answer those
questions, we can't be ``the'' team.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions? Yeah, like the departures of wide receiver Yancey
Thigpen, linebackers Chad Scott and Greg Lloyd, tackle John Jackson
and safety Myron Bell. Still, Pittsburgh watchers must have
confidence the holes will either be patched by coach Bill Cowher
(fives AFC Central titles, three AFC Championship Games and a 64-32
regular-season record) or hidden by the talent of quarterback
Kordell Stewart. Stewart is entering his fourth season but just his
second as a full-time starter.
</P>
<P>
   Says Pittsburgh assistant-turned-Cowboys head coach Chan Gailey
of Stewart:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've come close to seeing what he can and will
be.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's true of Stewart, it might also be true of Stewart's
team.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Steelers aren't the AFC team to beat, who is?
``Denver is that right now,'' Bettis says, ``because they've won a
Super Bowl and they have most of their team intact.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but the last AFC Super Bowl champion to defend its title
came 19 seasons years ago with quarterback Terry Bradshaw's
Steelers. That was a younger team; the same cannot be said for the
Broncos, who relied on 16-year quarterback John Elway and 18 other
players with eight or more seasons of experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose you can make the argument against us based on age,''
says Broncos cornerback Ray Crockett, who starts his 11th season.
``On the other hand, John's one of the elder statesmen in the NFL,
and when he considered retirement it shook up the whole league.
Would you rather we be a younger team and not have John Elway?''
</P>
<P>
   Would you rather be the Chiefs? Kansas City is the only team in
the NFL to finish first or second in its division in each of the
last nine seasons and have posted the NFL's best record in two of
the last three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The '97 club started a new quarterback in Elvis Grbac and four
'96 draft picks on defense yet finished 13-3. Now comes the
maturity of those players, plus newly acquired wide receiver
Derrick Alexander and veteran defensive linemen Chester McGlockton
and Leslie O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Says Alexander of the organization's aspirations: ``It's like
we've failed here if we don't get to the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jacksonville Jaguars have quickly elevated themselves to a
similar level of expectations. In just its fourth year of
operation, the expansion club boasts a premier offensive line
featuring tackles Tony Boselli and Leon Searcy, a
scrapheap-turned-Pro Bowl tandem of receivers in Jimmy Smith and
Keenan McCardell, a defense that should improve pass pressure with
the addition of Bryce Paup, and the franchise QB in Mark Brunell.
Brunell may be the best combination of polish and innovation this
side of Brett Favre and Steve Young.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the Patriots, an organization still stinging from
the widely held suspicion that the '96 edition qualified for the
Super Bowl on the solitary strength of departed coach Bill
Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's an unfair criticism of New England's talent
to say that any team Parcells coaches is probably going to be a
contender,'' says NFL scouting guru Gil Brandt. ``For me, New
England isn't at the same level as the Pittsburghs and Denvers. I
think it's fair to say Parcells got the most out of that bunch when
he was there, and now they've lost both their coach and their star
running back.''
</P>
<P>
   Runner Curtis Martin is gone (painfully for the Pats, he has
followed Parcells to another AFC East outpost, the New York Jets)
but not forgotten _ no matter how hard coach Pete Carroll tries.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll is whispering that rookie Robert Edwards is not only a
better running back than Martin, but that Edwards compares
favorably with Denver star Terrell Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Carroll's forecast goes unrealized, New England has an
edge over the other members of the AFC's Big Five: The Pats don't
have the sort of divisional shadow that Denver and Kansas City and
Pittsburgh and Jacksonville represent for one another _ unless ones
counts the track record of the Jets' Parcells and the Miami
Dolphins' Jimmy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything is achievable,'' says Dolphins linebacker Zach
Thomas. ``People might not see it right now because we haven't done
anything yet. But nothing is too far out of reach.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be the slogan for the AFC this season.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dozens of U.S. cruise missiles struck targets in
Afghanistan and Sudan on Thursday in what President Clinton
described as an act of self-defense against imminent terrorist
plots and of fearsome retribution for the bombings of U.S.
embassies in East Africa two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes were launched from ships in the Arabian Sea and Red
Sea, executed under the cover of darkness, with no U.S. casualties.
With about 75 missiles timed to explode simultaneously in
unsuspecting countries on two continents, the operation was the
most formidable U.S. military assault ever against a private
sponsor of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The targets were identified by Pentagon officials as an
extensive terrorism training complex in Afghanistan, 94 miles south
of Kabul, and a factory for the building blocks of chemical weapons
near Khartoum, Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his national security team linked both sites to
Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi millionaire tied by U.S.
intelligence to the twin bombings Aug. 7 in Kenya and Tanzania. The
bombings killed 12 Americans and nearly 300 Africans.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, who is in Afghanistan, apparently survived the
attack, which officials insisted was not aimed at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let our actions today send this message loud and clear,''
Clinton said in an address from the Oval Office. ``There are no
expendable American targets. There will be no sanctuary for
terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   The president made no apologies for ordering the strikes without
permission from Afghanistan or Sudan, saying, ``Countries that
persistently host terrorists have no right to be safe havens.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton returned to the White House on Thursday afternoon from
his vacation on Martha's Vineyard, where he was trying to repair
family relations damaged by his admission Monday of an intimate
relationship with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said they had no immediate estimate of damage
or casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen said the strikes were intended
to ``cause sufficient damage to disrupt them for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sudanese television on Thursday night broadcast images of a
ravaged, burning factory under a night sky stained orange.
</P>
<P>
   The president presented several reasons for the decision to act
swiftly and forcefully, rather than to try to punish bin Laden
through the means of diplomacy and law enforcement. Repeatedly he
said bin Laden presented an imminent threat, quoting his pledge
this week to wage a war in which Americans were ``all targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added that ``key terrorist leaders'' were believed to be
gathering Thursday at the compound in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had ``convincing'' intelligence that bin Laden's
terrorist network was behind the embassy bombings. And he accused
groups tied to bin Laden of a host of murderous attacks and foiled
plots like killing international peacekeepers in Somalia and
planning to assassinate the pope.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Republican leadership rallied to support the
raids, some members of Congress reacted suspiciously, noting that
the action followed by three days Clinton's acknowledgment to the
public and a grand jury of his relationship with former intern
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials scorned talk of a connection.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton's motorcade abruptly left the borrowed estate where
he was secluded with his wife and daughter, reporters and
photographers who were idling at the entrance assumed that he was
going to play golf. They reluctantly abandoned the movie that they
had begun to watch, ``Wag the Dog,'' about a fictional president
who manufactures a fake war to distract the nation from an
adulterous liaison.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton made a brief dramatic appearance to announce
the strikes. Clinton flew to Washington for his Oval Office address
as Ms. Lewinsky was testifying for a second time before the grand
jury here.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the planning for the mission began
10 days ago, shortly after the bombings. Clinton was first informed
of the planning in the White House situation room Aug. 12 and gave
tentative approval for a mission Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   He gave the final go-ahead in a telephone conversation at 3 a.m.
Thursday with National Security Adviser Samuel Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials denied any plan to assassinate bin Laden,
saying they intended only to damage his network.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether bin Laden was a legitimate military target, tary
Cohen said, ``To the extent that he or his organization have
declared war upon the United States or our interests, then he
certainly is engaged in an act of war.''
</P>
<P>
   The missiles were timed to hit at 1:30 Thursday afternoon
Eastern daylight time, or 7:30 in the evening in Sudan and 10 at
night in Afghanistan. The twin attacks provided a certain symmetry
to the bombings in East Africa. Though seas apart, the targets
share a connection to bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, who moved to Afghanistan two years ago from Sudan,
has continued to support the Sudanese military-industrial complex,
which operates the Al-Shifa factory that was bombed Thursday. That
factory, which has been said to manufacture pharmaceuticals, in
fact makes the components for VX gas and other chemical weapons,
the administration said.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Hugh Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said that bin Laden's network had ``been actively seeking to
acquire weapons of mass destruction, including chemical weapons for
use against U.S. citizens and our interests around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The target in Afghanistan was described as a vast compound
composed of a base camp, a support complex and four training camps
for teaching terrorists to plan attacks and use weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the site had been used to train ``literally
thousands of terrorists from around the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States obtained the permission of Pakistan to send
missiles over its territory into Afghanistan, but evidently alerted
none of its major allies except the British. The president made a
round of telephone calls to foreign leaders after his
seven-and-a-half-minute speech at 5:30.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The links between bin Laden and the bombings in Kenya and
Tanzania were established by intelligence networks rather than by
the inquiry at the bombing sites led by the FBI, according to
law-enforcement officials. The officials said the intelligence
included statements that implicated bin Laden by one suspect,
Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, who was apprehended in Pakistan and is now
being held in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Odeh told Pakistani authorities after his arrest Aug. 7, the day
of the bombing, that he was a disciple of bin Laden. He also said
he was an engineer who had helped build the Nairobi bomb, U.S.
officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders were briefed about the planned raid
Wednesday night and Thursday morning. For the most part, Republican
leaders praised Clinton's decision and urged more aggressive action
against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich expressed firm support.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said, ``Our response appears
to be appropriate and just.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were more critical. Accusing Clinton of ``lies and deceit
and manipulations and deceptions,'' Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., said
the president's record ``raises into doubt everything he does and
everything he says, and maybe even everything he doesn't do and
doesn't say.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials dismissed such skepticism. Asked about
comparisons between the strikes and ``Wag the Dog,'' Cohen said:
``The only motivation driving this action today was our absolute
obligation to protect the American people from terrorist
activities. That is the sole motivation. No other consideration has
been involved.''
</P>
<P>
   After the strikes Cohen ordered all military bases to increase
their states of alert. The United States on Thursday issued a new
worldwide warning to Americans and diplomatic personnel ``to
exercise much greater caution than usual.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Clinton warned Americans that the strike would by
no means put an end to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a long, ongoing struggle between freedom and
fanaticism, between the rule of law and terrorism,'' he said. ``We
must be prepared to do all that we can for as long as we must.
America is and will remain a target of terrorists precisely because
we are leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   The president was careful in his speech to stress that his
objection was to bin Laden, rather than to his religion, Islam. He
referred to bin Laden as ``perhaps the pre-eminent organizer and
financier of international terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing Islam as ``the faith of hundreds of millions of good
peace-loving people,'' Clinton said, ``Our actions were aimed at
fanatics and killers who wrap murder in the cloak of righteousness
and in so doing profane the great religion in whose name they claim
to act.''

CLINTON: U.S. STRIKES `BACK' WITH MISSILE ATTACKS IN AFGHANISTAN,
SUDAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American forces launched a missile attack at
suspected terrorist facilities in Afghanistan and Sudan on Thursday
in retaliation for bombings at U.S. embassies in Africa and to
pre-empt what President Clinton said were other planned attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In a pair of live television appearances, Clinton said he had
ordered the simultaneous attacks on terrorist organizations
affiliated with dissident Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden
``because we have convincing evidence these groups played the key
role in the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With compelling evidence that the bin Laden network of
terrorist groups was planning to mount further attacks against
Americans and other freedom-loving people, I decided America must
act,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional and Pentagon sources said the U.S. strikes were
carried out by Navy ships in the Red Sea and Arabian Sea that
launched up to 100 Tomahawk cruise missiles. The weapons targeted a
bin Laden terrorist complex in Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical
plant in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum suspected of producing
chemical weapons agents.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon and White House officials refused to release details of
the attacks, but said three targets in the terrorist complex
located 94 miles south of Kabul, Afghanistan, and the plant in
Khartoum were hit. The assault began about 1:30 p.m., EDT, and
lasted about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials were still waiting for damage reports
on the targets late Thursday night. But based on television reports
from Sudan showing the gutted and still burning Shifa
Pharmaceutical Plant, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
declared the missile strikes ``a success.''
</P>
<P>
   Sudanese officials claimed that the plant was actually a private
medical facility. But Albright said there was clear evidence that
it produces agents that could be used to make VX nerve gas and is
heavily guarded by the Sudanese military.
</P>
<P>
   The missile strike on the plant in Sudan touched off a massive
demonstration in front of the U.S. embassy in Khartoum, which has
been closed for nearly two years. Dozens of protesters stormed the
high fence surrounding it, but found only a few of their
compatriots who had been hired to look after the facility. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Clinton called the base in Afghanistan ``one of the most
active'' in the world, and blamed bin Laden, long suspected of
being a major sponsor of terrorism, for financing, planning and
executing the bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam on Aug. 7 that
killed 263 people, including 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we have struck back,'' the president declared.
</P>
<P>
   His dramatic announcement stunned the nation and caught most
lawmakers off guard. A few Republican critics questioned ``the
timing,'' of the attack, coming just three days after his public
admission that he had an ``inappropriate'' relationship with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we may have a president who is desperate to hold on to
this job,'' said Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind. He repeated a call he made
earlier this week for the president to resign.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the Republican leadership rallied to Clinton's side
in a show of unity. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of
Mississippi and House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia both praised
Clinton for taking military action.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said it would be ``sick'' for anyone to suggest that
Clinton's personal problems had driven him to take action. ``Based
on what I know, I think it was the right thing to do at the right
time,'' Gingrich told CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sens. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, who heads the
Foreign Relations Committee, and John McCain of Arizona, a member
of the Armed Services Committee, also stood behind the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton interrupted his vacation on Martha's Vineyard to
announce the missile strikes, then flew to Washington for a
briefing by military and national security officials.
</P>
<P>
   In a second televised appearance late Thursday afternoon, the
president said his primary motivation for ordering the strikes was
to prevent other attacks on U.S. targets, which he described as
``an immediate threat.''
</P>
<P>
   He said U.S. intelligence sources had also uncovered evidence
that ``a gathering of key terrorist leaders was to take place
today'' at the Afghanistan complex ``thus underscoring the urgency
of our actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said later
that FBI and U.S. intelligence officials investigating the bombings
in Kenya and Tanzania had obtained ``very reliable information''
that other U.S. embassies and facilities were about to be hit by
elements supported by bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had very specific information about very specific threats
in respect to very specific targets,'' Berger added, noting that a
number of U.S. embassies, including one in Albania, had been closed
in recent days because of the threats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton indicated that the military strikes may be the first
step in what could be a prolonged U.S. campaign aimed at wiping out
key terrorist cells. He said bin Laden, who he described as the
``pre-eminent organizer and financier of international terrorism in
the world today,'' was also responsible for assassination attempts
on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let our actions today send this message loud and clear: There
are no expendable American targets,'' Clinton said. ``We will
defend our people, our interests and our values.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said they were fairly confident that the
heavy missile attack on what they described as bin Laden's
``terrorist university'' in Afghanistan had severely damaged his
ability to train and support his operatives and those connected
with other terrorist groups he backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facilities we struck today in Afghanistan and Sudan are
important parts of the bin Laden network terrorist groups,'' said
Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He said
the bases not only provide ``refuge for terrorists'' but also serve
as ``the key command and control'' center for terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
   A Taliban spokesman said bin Laden was unharmed in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   But Defense Secretary William Cohen said the intent of the
mission, which was unanimous approval of all Clinton's national
security advisers, was to destroy bin Laden's ability to support
terrorist acts and not necessarily to kill bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that these strikes will not eliminate the
problem, but our message is clear,'' said Cohen. ``There will be no
sanctuary for terrorists.''

 NationsBank Hated American Banker Story, Plans to Cancel   By Mark Veverka  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Talk about thin-skinned.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the rare event that you were looking for more absurdity
wrought by mega-bank merger mania, try this on for size.
NationsBank President Kenneth Lewis plans to cancel his bankholding
company's subscriptions to the American Banker because the trade
paper ran an article that audaciously suggests how it should handle
its community reinvestment obligations in California.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Fire the messenger.
</P>
<P>
   Just because Lewis didn't agree with an opinion piece submitted
to the American Banker by the Greenlining Institute, a San
Francisco advocacy group for minorities and low-income folks, he
thinks he's going to punish the publishers of the paper by
scrapping his bank's 250 or so subscriptions, according to an
internal memo signed by Lewis, which was obtained by Chronicle
banking reporter Peter Sinton. NationsBank, BankAmerica and
American Banker officials declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch. This Lewis is a tough guy. Boy, that kind of hardball
tactic is really going to make those editors at the American Banker
shake in their boots, hey?
</P>
<P>
   How silly. With mature and enlightened leadership like that
waiting for us back in Charlotte, N.C., it's no wonder BankAmerica
customers are concerned that commitment to low-income neighborhoods
will wane after their bank becomes part of Hugh McColl's banking
empire this fall.
</P>
<P>
   And when you hear what the crux of the op-ed column was about,
Lewis' overreaction is going to seem even sillier. Essentially, the
piece by Greenlining's John Gamboa and Mary Ann Mitchell,
chairwoman of the National Black Business Council, suggests that
NationsBank should follow the example set by Washington Mutual. The
authors applauded the Seattle-based thrift for the way it handled
the buyouts of some good-size California savings and loans.
</P>
<P>
   What they liked most and recommended &UR;  &LR; that NationsBank emulate
was Washington Mutual's willingness to draft a community
reinvestment agreement. As opposed to some rather loosey-goosey
pledge of $350 billion as NationsBank is wont to have, Wamu (as
they say in banking circles) outlined specific goals on how it
would serve and lend money to less fortunate communities. Gee, what
an offensive idea.
</P>
<P>
   How did Lewis, the NationsBank executive, react to this
constructive input? Not very well, needless to say. In a memorandum
dated August 4, Lewis wrote: ``I am sure that you are as offended
and angry as I am about an industry newspaper doing such a thing.
Given that we are very focused on expense savings, couldn't we do
without this newspaper?''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, terrific. The bank can extract some of the $1.3 billion in
economies of scale expected from swallowing BankAmerica by
canceling its newspaper subscriptions. Without knowing what kind of
a deal the bank has with the paper (let's just use the bank's
discounted annual subscription rate of $795), that might just save
NationsBank a whopping $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's what I call high finance. No wonder Lewis gets paid
the big bucks. Shareholders are coughing up at least $1.2 million a
year before stock options for this kind of executive acumen. (His
stock grants are currently worth more than $14 million.)
</P>
<P>
   To say the least, Lewis really knows how to slice the marble off
the cow, doesn't he?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pour Some More  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There's little doubt that the Internet offers investors far more
access to government filings and real-time information than ever
before. But sometimes it isn't always presented in context, and
that can cause some minor confusion. At least, that may have been
what happened with Golden State Vintners.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of readers responded to Wednesday's column, saying that
insider selling may have driven down the wine stock's shares
shortly after going public in July.
</P>
<P>
   That probably wasn't the case. In fact, some federal filings on
July 27 show that about 1.1 million shares of common were sold at
an average price of $15.88 a share by a group of insiders,
including directors.
</P>
<P>
   But venture capitalists didn't just impulsively dump shares on
the market. These were ownership shares sold to the public as part
of the offering. It happens that there is a three- to five-day
settlement period that follows an initial offering before the
transactions get posted with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, explains Golden State chief financial officer Brian
Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   The company's IPO ``was always intended to provide liquidity to
certain shareholders (and) I can understand how there might be some
confusion'' from the filings, Thompson says.
</P>
<P>
   Did the postings contribute to the stock's slide that began a
few days after the IPO?
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly don't believe so,'' Thompson says.
</P>
<P>
   Insider trading expert Bob Gabele concurs.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State shares ``were sold in the deal,'' which means there
were existing shares as well as newly created shares in the
offering, says Gabele, editor of Maryland-based CDA Investnet's
Insiders' Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that unusual to see selling in the deal,'' Gabele
says.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, Bob.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel was quick to congratulate the United States
on Thursday night for its missile attacks on suspected terrorist
bases, but the early reaction from many other governments in the
Middle East was a notable silence.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair was alone among European
leaders in expressing strong support Thursday for the U.S. air
strikes. Japan gave qualified backing for action, saying it was
still analyzing the situation but held that terrorism must be
combatted resolutely.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis, who have suffered more recent terrorist attacks than
any other country, saw the operation as vindication of their own
calls for confrontation toward Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said the U.S. raids had
underscored the fact that ``the war against terror everywhere is
never-ending and necessary in order to ensure stability and
security around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Arab governments that have fought long battles against
terrorism seemed cautious about adopting a similar public stance.
Many Arab leaders have criticized what they call an imbalance in
U.S. policy in the region and are sensitive to the possibility that
their citizens might regard the U.S. raids less as strikes against
terror than attacks on Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Among Arab countries, Egypt may have been typical in that its
state-run television station broadcast news about the U.S. attack
without reporting any comment from the government.
</P>
<P>
   The raids were launched on the eve of the Muslim holy day, and
in Jerusalem, Israeli authorities said they were concerned that
Friday prayer gatherings in the walled old city could become the
setting for anti-American demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Only Libya and Iraq, the United States' declared foes in the
region, were explicit in condemning the U.S. raids. The Libyan
leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, whose country was the target of a
1986 U.S. air raid that was characterized as retaliation for
terrorism, was reported by Libyan state television to have
telephoned President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan to express
support ``in this fight against aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi state television said the United States had turned its
back on international law and was using terrorism to further its
own aims. ``Is the bombardment of safe populated areas, factories,
or any inhabited place _ as the United States did when it bombed
areas in Sudan and Afghanistan _ not considered terrorism?'' the
British Broadcasting Corporation quoted an Iraqi television
commentary as saying.
</P>
<P>
   But a more telling gauge of the hostility with which many
ordinary Arabs were responding to the operation could be heard on
some Arabic-language television call-in shows, including one
broadcast by Sudan television. In a portion that was broadcast live
by CNN Thursday night, a number of callers expressed solidarity
with Sudan and denounced the United States and a U.S. president
whom some suggested was trying to turn attention away from his
relationship with a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Several callers identified themselves as being from Saudi
Arabia, whose government is a close ally of the United States but
where many citizens have deep misgivings about those ties. One
caller, who did not give his name but said he was calling from
Riyadh, the Saudi capital, said of Clinton, ``The way out for him
was basically to carry out an operation that would divert attention
from his own lies and problems by attacking sites in Sudan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows that the strongest power on earth is being led
now by a liar,'' the Sudanese host agreed. ``How would we know that
what he says isn't a lie?''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Thursday night, U.S. officials took pains to
muffle Arab protests. Clinton declared that ``our actions were not
aimed against Islam,'' and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said she had been in touch with other world leaders _ including
Arabs _ and that they had been ``very supportive of our efforts.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That seemed an echo of U.S. assertions earlier this year that
there was broad Arab backing for a possible military attack against
Iraq. In that instance, however, concern about a possible popular
backlash to a strike on other Muslims led most Arab leaders to
publicly warn against such an attack.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for Arab unhappiness with U.S. policy in the
Middle East remains a perception that the United States is leaning
too far toward Israel in negotiations aimed at forging a broader
Arab-Israeli peace. By contrast, Israeli officials have sometimes
complained that their U.S. counterparts are not sufficiently
sensitive to their country's security concerns, and the importance
of retaliating swiftly to acts of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Blair of Britain, on vacation in France, said, ``I strongly
support this American action against international terrorists.
Terrorists the world over know that democratic governments will act
decisively to prevent their evil crimes.''

INCOMNET SHARES DIP ON MONEY TALK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shares in long-distance telecommunications
marketer Incomnet Inc. lost nearly one-third of their value on news
the company is in talks with its main lender, shareholder and
supplier to restructure the company.
</P>
<P>
   Incomnet Chief Executive Officer Melvin Reznick said Thursday he
is talking with lender First Bank, telecom provider WorldCom and
investor Jack Casey about restructuring the company in a way that
would allow Incomnet to repay WorldCom an unspecified amount for
past services and get more money from First Bank to continue
operating.
</P>
<P>
   Time is of the essence, Reznick said, as WorldCom has threatened
to cut off service to Incomnet if an agreement is not reached by
Aug. 28. WorldCom provides the actual long-distance service that
Incomnet sells.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a rocky few months for Incomnet. In addition to
reporting a $2.1 million loss on $16 million in sales Monday, the
company was notified this week by the Nasdaq stock exchange that
its shares will be relegated to over-the-counter status because
Incomnet does not have at least $2 million in assets.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the company announced that an effort to sell its
telecommunications business had fallen through. Later that month,
two former Incomnet officers and a former director were accused by
the Securities and Exchange Commission of illegally profiting from
trading in the company's stock.

<P>
   Major League Baseball is investigating the possible role of
American League umpires in the sale of baseballs used in the
perfect game that David Wells of the Yankees pitched against the
Minnesota Twins May 17.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball officials confirmed the investigation Thursday, but
declined to identify the umpires. Others, however, including a Long
Island sports memorabilia dealer who said he bought 14 balls, named
Al Clark as the umpire who was directly involved in the
transaction. Two baseball officials also said Clark's name had come
up in the investigation as having been involved in the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Lewis, the dealer, said Clark provided a letter
authenticating the balls, each of which bore Wells' signature and a
hand-written notation that it was used in the game. Clark was not
part of the umpiring crew that worked the game at Yankee Stadium,
but Lewis said Clark's letter revealed he obtained the balls from
John Hirschbeck, who was the first-base umpire that day.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschbeck denied Thursday that he gave any balls to Clark and
said he had no idea why Clark would say that he did.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, an American League umpire since 1976, was on his
in-season vacation, and attempts to reach him through the American
League and Richie Phillips, the head of the umpires union, were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's policy on the sale of paraphernalia by umpires is not
clear-cut. Gene Budig, the American League president, said Thursday
that both leagues have distributed to their umpires guidelines on
various matters. One policy, he said, dealt with autographs,
memorabilia and tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting from the instructions about memorabilia, Budig said:
``There is to be no asking players, managers, coaches or other
field personnel for autographs. If you need an item or an autograph
for a charity event or other special/unique reason, please contact
the league office and we will contact the club on your behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the policy covers the sale of the so-called items, such
as baseballs, Budig declined to say. He also declined to comment on
the investigation, saying only, ``The league is aware of the matter
and it is being reviewed by appropriate staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Hallinan, baseball's chief security official, said the
American League had asked him to look into the matter, but he
declined to comment on his investigation except to say, ``We
haven't targeted Al or anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the policy Budig cited, umpires often ask players for
autographs and memorabilia. Players have long hated the practice,
but they feel they can neither refuse the requests nor complain
about them because they fear the umpires will retaliate with their
calls in games.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the issues players raise with us with frequency,'' said
Donald Fehr, head of the players association, ``is requests by
umpires for players to provide memorabilia, which in many cases the
players expect will be sold.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is a subject under discussion between clubs and the
players union.
</P>
<P>
   Wells declined to talk about the sale of the balls from his
perfect game, but a baseball official said the pitcher learned from
a friend that the balls were being advertised for sale. Lewis, the
dealer, said in a telephone interview that Wells called him and
questioned the authenticity of the balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He questioned whether the umpires got the balls from the ball
bag because he thought he received all the balls from the ball
bag,'' related Lewis, who Thursday was at Shea Stadium prepared to
pay $10,000 to the fan who caught Mark McGwire's 50th home run.
</P>
<P>
   The ball bag in question contained balls that were used in the
game or rubbed up for use in the game. The home-plate umpire keeps
several balls in a bag hanging from his waist, and when he needs a
fresh supply, the ball boy brings balls to him from the ball bag.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschbeck, in denying any role in the sale of the balls, also
questioned their authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how they can be legitimate,' he said by telephone
from Youngstown, Ohio, where he had just played a round of golf on
his vacation. ``I know the ball bag never came to our locker room.
They came to Wells.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirschbeck, an American League umpire since 1984, said that Tim
McClelland, who was the plate umpire that day, had four balls in
his ball bag at the end of the game. ``David Wells signed those and
Tim gave one to each of us,'' Hirschbeck said. ``I still have
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he agreed to buy 14 balls from a man representing
Clark whom he identified as Rich Gressle, a New Jersey resident.
The dealer said he paid $300 a ball for the first six balls and
quickly sold four for $1,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Not long afterward, he said, he was visited by Ed Petersen,
Hallinan's assistant in baseball's security department. Once he
learned the matter was under investigation, Lewis said, he asked
the buyers to return the balls, and he gave back their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reputation was on the line because there was a question,''
Lewis said, explaining his move. He added that Gressle asked for
all of the balls back and sent him a check for $1,800. However,
Lewis added, Petersen asked to borrow a ball for baseball's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis also said if the balls turn out to be legitimate and
remain available, he would buy them again.
</P>
<P>
   He said they had Wells's signature with the date on what he
called ``the sweet spot'' of the ball. Underneath the signature, he
said, was a notation that the balls were ``game-used.'' He said
Clark's letter said the notation was made by the umpires.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschbeck said he did not understand why Clark wrote in the
letter that the balls came from him. He said the only contact he
has had with Clark this season was at a series he worked in New
York, when the Yankees played the Boston Red Sox. Hirschbeck said
he substituted for Jim McKean, the crew chief, in that series that
began 11 days after the perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschbeck said he was in New York when he heard that balls from
the game were for sale and met with Wells to tell him that neither
he nor any other members of the umpiring crew had anything to do
with the advertised balls.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he has received many other items from umpires for
sale but declined to identify any of them.

   WASHINGTON _ The most cherished axiom of U.S. diplomacy is that
politics stops at the water's edge, meaning that political
opponents support the president when missiles are flying. Thursday,
it mostly worked, but the challenge of President Clinton's latest
crisis crystallized when some critics uncharacteristically cried
foul.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of Republican congressional leaders, from House Speaker
Newt Gingrich to such frequent Clinton adversaries as Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., rallied around the commander-in-chief, with Gingrich
declaring: ``I think, based on what I know, that it was the right
thing to do at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the surreal and cinematic atmosphere that suffused
official Washington all week, some voices that would usually be
reliably hawkish suddenly sounded just plain shrill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger here is that once a president loses credibility
with the Congress, as this president has through months of lies and
deceit and manipulations and deceptions, stonewalling, it raises
into doubt everything he does and everything he says, and maybe
even everything he doesn't do and doesn't say,'' said Sen. Dan
Coats, R-Ind., who less than 72 hours earlier had called for
Clinton's resignation over the Monica Lewinsky issue.
</P>
<P>
   Coats added, ``I just hope and pray the decision that was made
was made on the basis of sound judgment and made for the right
reasons, and not made because it was necessary to save the
president's job.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., was only slightly softer in
questioning Clinton's air strikes in Afghanistan and the Sudan,
insisting: ``I'm not going to suggest ulterior motives,'' but
adding, ``I especially want to know the reason for doing it now. I
want to know what the evidence was.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the city, there was an inescapable sense Thursday that
the timing of the raid might have been dictated by politics rather
than intelligence information. Among the questions that Defense
Secretary William Cohen faced at the official Pentagon briefing on
the air strikes was whether he had seen ``Wag the Dog,'' the
satirical film in which a president concocts a war to deflect
attention from a sexual encounter with a teen-age girl. He did not
bother to answer, instead insisting, ``The only motivation driving
this action today was our absolute obligation to protect the
American people from terrorist activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., said, ``I think that's pure
malarkey,'' when he was asked about any connection between the
cruise-missile strikes and Clinton's political and legal problems.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that such questions came up at all was seen as an example
of the damage the Lewinsky matter has done to Clinton's overall
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing people think about is `Why did the president
do this; is it to divert attention from other problems that have
been plaguing the White House?''' asked Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn.
``That just shows how much damage has been done to the institution
of the presidency.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even many of those who voiced support of the president reflected
the toll of the Lewinsky matter, taking pains to discount any link
without being asked. ``I know some are suggesting this was a
decision made for other reasons, because of the Monica Lewinsky
investigation,'' Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., told reporters
without prompting. ``To those people I have one thing to say:
Either put up or shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   More typical was Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah _ who had dismissed
Clinton's Monday speech on the Lewinsky matter by saying, ``What a
jerk!''_ said Thursday, ``Now I want to applaud the president. I
want to give him credit for being willing to take this action at
this time. Some people have been critical. The fact is, I doubt
that he would have taken this action without an awful lot of
intelligence backup.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholars who have studied the links between past presidents'
foreign policy actions and public opinion found none of that
surprising Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never discovered any kind of factors that negate these
things from happening,'' said Larry Hugick, director of media and
political surveys at Princeton Survey Research Associates in
Princeton, N.J., who has studied presidential approval ratings in
foreign policy crises from Harry Truman to George Bush. ``In a
legitimate crisis where a president is using military force and
it's widely known to the public here, there's a tendency for his
approval rating to rise, and I would expect it would here.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Bardes, a professor of political science at the
University of Cincinnati, agreed that presidential performance
ratings have risen for everything from Ronald Reagan's 1986 air
strikes on Libya in retaliation for the bombing of a West Berlin
night club, to his invasion of Grenada, to Bush's invasion of
Panama and his handling of the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is how do you prove success in an atmosphere in
which there is some suspicion of the administration's
forthrightness,'' Professor Bardes said. ``That makes this a
riskier proposition than those other moves. There was an underlying
confidence in the Gulf war that the smart bombs went down the
chimney, and then later we found out it wasn't quite that good. But
now we're in a very funny time period, a very tenuous
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugick noted that even failures, like John F. Kennedy's
disastrous invasion of the Bay of Pigs in 1961, or Jimmy Carter's
failed rescue mission for the Iranian hostages in 1980, have caused
temporary rises in approval ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his administration, Clinton's policies have often
been driven by polling, though his aides have always been loath to
ascribe any political motives to his foreign policy moves. But when
Clinton finally intervened in Bosnia, after temporizing for his two
years in office, his aides acknowledged that the president began to
appreciate the unilateral power he had over foreign policy even as
a Republican Congress stymied many of his domestic plans, and he
had always hoped that foreign policy would play a more prominent
role in his second term.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., urged Clinton on.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration for the last seven months has neglected
compelling national security threats besides this _ Saddam
Hussein's ejection of our inspectors, North Korea building nuclear
weapons again in violation of an agreement, Middle East peace
process stalled, thousands of people being ethnically cleaned in
Kosovo,'' McCain said. ``I hope that the president will not confine
his activities to just this, but to address the other very
compelling problems that also affect our nation's security problems
long-term.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mark McGwire is a tough guy to budge. Pitchers can't
knock him off the plate, and inquisitors can't throw him off his
stance on the home run record.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody gets to 50 by September,'' McGwire said Thursday,
reiterating his view on the subject of the day, ``they have a shot
down the stretch run to either tie, break or get close to it. Now
you can say, hey, `this guy legitimately has a shot to do it.'
That's what I've truly believed since I was a young kid hitting
home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   All right, Mark, going into this first of two doubleheaders with
the Mets in the space of about 30 hours, you have 49 home runs. Are
you prepared to declare that you have a legitimate shot at Roger
Maris' record of 61 home runs?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll say it once I hit 50,'' he said, his reddish face
breaking into a smile. ``I gotta stick with my statement.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement became effective a few hours later when, 12 days
from September, McGwire slugged No. 50 into the left-center field
bleachers at Shea Stadium. The seventh-inning shot in the first
game made McGwire the first player to reach 50 in three successive
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   As he rounded the bases jubilantly, McGwire pumped his right
fist and clapped. He was ecstatic, as he should have been. Later,
in the first inning in the second game, he hit his 51st, running
the bases with less animation.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, when he said he was sticking to his statement, the
mammoth McGwire laughed. It was nice to see the broad smile and
hear the hearty laugh. Any player with a legitimate shot to break
the record should have fun doing it. Unfortunately, though, the
attention that becomes focused on that player and his quest can
make his life miserable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It did that to Maris in 1961, and even McGwire has shown signs
of strain in recent weeks as he struggled to add to his total. In a
17-game span between his 45th (July 28) and 48th (Wednesday) home
runs, McGwire batted .196 and struck out 31 times in 56 times at
bat. His strikeout total matched the combined total of his hits
(11) and walks (20).
</P>
<P>
   But whatever strain seeped into McGwire's psyche could have been
eased had his team, the St. Louis Cardinals, been competing for a
playoff spot. Like the Mets, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I envious?'' McGwire asked, repeating a question about the
Mets. ``If we were in that position, it would make it easier on me.
I wouldn't be such a focal point. The team would.''
</P>
<P>
   But in that period, while the Mets were moving from three games
behind the Chicago Cubs in the wild-card race to a percentage point
ahead, the Cardinals were tumbling another three games in the
standing and too far back to contend for any playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the home-run chase in relation to the playoff race,
McGwire wistfully said he would opt for the latter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd take the winning,'' he said. ``That's what everybody plays
the game for. I've never once played this game for individual
accomplishments. I play to win. It's been a disappointing year
because we were tabbed to probably win the Central. There are times
we've played like a championship team, then we turn around and lose
four or five straight. It's been one of those years that's been
upsetting for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is more frustrating, he was asked, losing four or five in
a row or going 10 games without hitting a home run? ``Losing four
or five straight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many people might find that view difficult to believe. Who
wouldn't want to hit 62 home runs, they think. Who wouldn't want to
eclipse Babe Ruth and Roger Maris?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's America's pastime,'' McGwire said, explaining the huge
attention baseball in general and the home run pursuit in
particular command. ``Every child, boy or girl, has picked up a
bat, ball, glove, has played the game in some sort when they're a
child, whether it be softball, Wiffle Ball, Little League.
Everybody can associate with playing it one time in their life.''
</P>
<P>
   That scrutiny also brings pressure, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To think the whole world's watching you, that's a lot of
pressure for just one person,'' he said. ``If we were in the World
Series, you'd be watching the whole team.''
</P>
<P>
   But McGwire is the one everybody watches. Fans everywhere pull
for him to break the record as strongly as too many fans rooted
shamefully against Maris in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody wants a piece of McGwire, too. Fans want to know
everything about him. But he won't let them learn too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want people to know me,'' he said. ``It's not for the
public to know. There are some things I have to keep private. I
have a private life. I'm entitled to a private life.''
</P>
<P>
   He sounded like another public figure who had made his pitch for
privacy earlier in the week. But McGwire's approval rating would be
higher.

<P>
   Behind the curtain at Livent Inc., the corporate theater
producer, the flamboyant impresario Garth Drabinsky did not just
produce Tony Award-winning Broadway musicals. He also created a
brilliant but mythical setting for his business, a world where much
of his famously lavish spending was visible on stage but somehow
rarely hurt the company's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   One of Drabinsky's props was Livent's financial books, which are
being investigated by securities regulators. The company's new
owners, Michael Ovitz and Roy Furman, say the books appear to have
been doctored.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many musicals that have ``angels,'' or private investors
who carefully track how a producer is spending their money,
Drabinsky's shows did not get such scrutiny. Livent, a public
company, produced many shows at once, lumping expenses together,
and disclosed few details on which ones _ if any _ were making
money.
</P>
<P>
   Other theater executives wondered how long the company could
afford extravagances such as a cast of 67 performers for
``Showboat'' and the dozens of double-page color newspaper ads
promoting its shows. One associate of Cameron Mackintosh, the
highly regarded producer of ``Miss Saigon,'' ``Phantom of the
Opera'' and ``Les Miserables,'' for example, remembers that
Mackintosh bet him four years ago that Drabinsky's company would
fail. Mackintosh could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, did Ovitz, the former talent agent and former
president of Walt Disney Co., put $20 million into Livent, and why
did Furman, a co-founder of the Wall Street firm Furman Selz, agree
to put up $2 million and become chairman? Furman, who had sold his
firm to ING Group last October, said, ``We wanted to be able to
look back and say that we were the people who proved to the public
that theater was profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love theater,'' he said. ``It is very important that theater
be done properly.'' He said that they thought they could change a
``financial model that was wrong.'' Ovitz declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   A person close to Livent said that the two men knew before they
took control that the company had some financial problems, though
they did not anticipate what they call accounting irregularities.
Just last week, Furman and his new management team announced that
they had discovered those irregularities and that they were
suspending Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb, the company's vice
president and a co-founder with Drabinksy.
</P>
<P>
   The company has released few details, but some executives say
privately that Drabinsky kept ``a second set of books.'' They say
it appeared that the two men had run out of ways to keep their
spending from hurting the company's profits and had inappropriately
moved the costs to other accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky and Gottlieb have denied any wrongdoing and any
knowledge of a second set of books. And on Thursday, a spokesman
for the two questioned why so many accusations were being hurled at
them. He said that the new management had been given ``ample
opportunity during a protracted due diligence process to ask any
questions they had.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are concerns being raised now?'' the spokesman asked.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the new team had not discovered any irregularities,
warning signs that Drabinsky's high-spending ways would eventually
catch up with Livent had been popping up for years.
</P>
<P>
   _ The company's debt was labeled ``junk'' last year by Wall
Street bond-rating agencies because of worries that the company
would not be able to make interest payments that amount to nearly
$13 million each year. The company's debt now exceeds $130 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ The company, which is based in Toronto, used Canadian
accounting standards, which are looser and allow companies to
record profits sooner than the rules in the United States. For
example, the $29 million loss that Livent reported last year using
Canadian accounting would have shown up as $38 million using
American standards, according to the company's financial
statements.
</P>
<P>
   _ Analysts complained about an accounting method that the
company adopted in 1996 that in essence allowed Drabinsky to spend
as much as he wanted on a musical for costs such as advertising,
costumes and scenery without deducting them immediately from the
bottom line. Unlike most other Broadway productions, Livent was
able after changing its accounting methods to show a profit on a
musical even before ticket sales covered the costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accounting was aggressive,'' said David McFadgen, an
entertainment industry analyst with Griffiths McBurney and Partners
in Montreal. ``It just made no sense.'' McFadgen has long been
critical of the company's financial reporting and recalls how
Drabinsky once yelled at him on the phone for issuing a negative
report.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Livent's vendors had been complaining for years
that the company took months to pay its bills. For example, the
owners of shoemaking shops and fabric stores in Toronto, where
Livent creates most of its musicals, complained about Drabinsky's
slow bill-paying habits to one costume designer who was trying to
buy attire for another producer's show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every place I went, they would say, `You're not with Garth
Drabinsky, are you?''' said the costume designer, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. ``His reputation was the worst.'' A
spokesman for Drabinksky declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   What shocked several veteran Broadway producers and executives
was the company's high-spending ways. For example, the cast of 67
performers for Livent's revival of ``Showboat'' was
``unprecedented,'' one Broadway executive said. ``And the company
was spending massive amounts of money on advertising,'' this person
said, including double-page color ads in major newspapers,
including The New York Times.

DISNEY TO DISTRIBUTE FUTURE BIRNBAUM FILMS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Walt Disney Co. has announced that it has
signed a distribution deal with high-profile producer Roger
Birnbaum for up to five movies a year through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment giant said Thursday the deal with Birnbaum's
newly formed Spyglass Entertainment calls for Spyglass to finance
the projects with Disney handling distribution in the United
States, United Kingdom, Australia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The deal reflects Disney's strategy of spending less on
live-action movies, which have provided lower profits than most
other operations, while continuing to send a full pipeline of
product to multiplexes. ``As we reduce our investment in our
release slate we look forward to distributing first-tier,
independently financed films,'' Disney studio chief Joe Roth said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal is pretty consistent with what Disney has said it
wanted to do,'' said Stewart Halpern, an analyst with ING Barings
Furman Selz. ``It's a way to make a low-risk profit and maintain an
appropriate volume for its distribution infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   The pact calls for Birnbaum's Caravan Pictures to stop
operations following release of New Line's ``Rush Hour'' and two
upcoming Disney movies _ ``Simon Birch'' and Eddie Murphy's ``Holy
Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Spyglass' major upcoming projects include ``From Alice to the
Ocean'' with Julia Roberts as a producer and star; ``The
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,'' based on Douglas Adams'
best-selling novel; ``Cosmo Cop'' with Murphy; and remakes of ``The
Errand Boy'' and ``Old Dark House.'' &QL;

<P>
   Some critics also said that given its financial state, the
company had spent too much to build theaters _ $35 million for the
Ford Center for the Performing Arts in Manhattan alone _ and to
promote shows in a notoriously unpredictable business. They noted
that even producers of mega-hits showed more restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Even Livent's biggest hit before ``Showboat'' and ``Ragtime,''
the Tony-Award-winning ``Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' had reported a
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the financial woes they inherited, Ovitz and Furman
are said to think that by tightening financial controls, they can
turn the company around. One person who knows Ovitz well said he
compared the enterprise to a movie studio that can release several
films at a time and let the profits from the blockbusters carry the
rest of the company.
</P>
<P>
   And some entertainment executives said privately that the two
men might have found the Livent deal appealing because both are at
personal crossroads in their careers and both like the
entertainment business. Furman, 59, apparently wanted a new
challenge after selling his investment firm. And Ovitz, once
referred to as the most powerful man in Hollywood, has been without
a focus since he left Disney. ``Where else could Ovitz get control
of a highly visible company for $20 million,'' asked one industry
executive, who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Furman is a veteran investor in the entertainment business.
Furman Selz had taken large stakes at one time or another in Time
Warner, MCA, Carolco, New Line Cinema and others. He has also
headed the Film Society of Lincoln Center and is an avid
theatergoer.
</P>
<P>
   The two men were so enamored of show business, apparently, that
they were willing to set aside Drabinsky's checkered stewardship of
another company, Cineplex Odeon, the movie theater chain, nearly a
decade ago. That company was also criticized for its aggressive
accounting methods. In 1989, Drabinsky was ousted in a fierce
battle with MCA, one of Cineplex Odeon's largest shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   However, neither Furman nor Ovitz had extensive financial
experience in the arcane world of live theater. And Furman had
never run a public company. Not only that but, for now at least,
they must rely on several of the same creative executives who
worked for Drabinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Associates said one of the main protections they saw for their
investment was the value of the real estate: Besides its New York
theater, Livent owns two in Toronto, one in Vancouver, British
Columbia, and one in Chicago. One person close to the company
estimated their value at up to $200 million, though a theater
industry expert, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, gave a
lower estimate of about $120 million, not enough to wipe out the
company's debt.
</P>
<P>
   Furman also sees plays as ``software'' that could generate pay
television, pay-per-view and video rights, one of his associates
said. One pay-television executive who spoke on the condition of
anonymity said there was no recent history of Broadway shows
selling to pay TV or pay-per-per view because there was not much
interest in buying such projects. Revenues from home-video sales
have been slim.
</P>
<P>
   Livent clearly has a long way to go. It has said it will take
additional write-offs that have nothing to do with the accounting
irregularities and that possibly relate to the North American tour
of ``Showboat.'' And despite the near-sellout of ``Ragtime'' in New
York, it is doing relatively mediocre business on tour. Though
Livent plans to open ``Ragtime'' in Chicago in October, its debut
in London has been postponed indefinitely. If it does open there,
Livent might try to cut costs by taking sets and props from an
existing production, a person close to the company said.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, ``Ragtime'' and other Livent shows will have to
lure audiences without the huge advertising budgets for which
Drabinsky was famous. That makes the new owners' bet on which plays
to produce and which performers to hire all that more crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, those were the things that Drabinsky, now gone, did best.

<P>
   Behind the curtain at Livent Inc., the corporate theater
producer, the flamboyant impresario Garth Drabinsky did not just
produce Tony Award-winning Broadway musicals. He also created a
brilliant but mythical setting for his business, a world where much
of his famously lavish spending was visible on stage but somehow
rarely hurt the company's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   One of Drabinsky's props was Livent's financial books, which are
being investigated by securities regulators. The company's new
owners, Michael Ovitz and Roy Furman, say the books appear to have
been doctored.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many musicals that have ``angels,'' or private investors
who carefully track how a producer is spending their money,
Drabinsky's shows did not get such scrutiny. Livent, a public
company, produced many shows at once, lumping expenses together,
and disclosed few details on which ones _ if any _ were making
money.
</P>
<P>
   Other theater executives wondered how long the company could
afford extravagances such as a cast of 67 performers for
``Showboat'' and the dozens of double-page color newspaper ads
promoting its shows. One associate of Cameron Mackintosh, the
highly regarded producer of ``Miss Saigon,'' ``Phantom of the
Opera'' and ``Les Miserables,'' for example, remembers that
Mackintosh bet him four years ago that Drabinsky's company would
fail. Mackintosh could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, did Ovitz, the former talent agent and former
president of Walt Disney Co., put $20 million into Livent, and why
did Furman, a co-founder of the Wall Street firm Furman Selz, agree
to put up $2 million and become chairman? Furman, who had sold his
firm to ING Group last October, said, ``We wanted to be able to
look back and say that we were the people who proved to the public
that theater was profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love theater,'' he said. ``It is very important that theater
be done properly.'' He said that they thought they could change a
``financial model that was wrong.'' Ovitz declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   A person close to Livent said that the two men knew before they
took control that the company had some financial problems, though
they did not anticipate what they call accounting irregularities.
Just last week, Furman and his new management team announced that
they had discovered those irregularities and that they were
suspending Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb, the company's vice
president and a co-founder with Drabinksy.
</P>
<P>
   The company has released few details, but some executives say
privately that Drabinsky kept ``a second set of books.'' They say
it appeared that the two men had run out of ways to keep their
spending from hurting the company's profits and had inappropriately
moved the costs to other accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky and Gottlieb have denied any wrongdoing and any
knowledge of a second set of books. And on Thursday, a spokesman
for the two questioned why so many accusations were being hurled at
them. He said that the new management had been given ``ample
opportunity during a protracted due diligence process to ask any
questions they had.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are concerns being raised now?'' the spokesman asked.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the new team had not discovered any irregularities,
warning signs that Drabinsky's high-spending ways would eventually
catch up with Livent had been popping up for years.
</P>
<P>
   _ The company's debt was labeled ``junk'' last year by Wall
Street bond-rating agencies because of worries that the company
would not be able to make interest payments that amount to nearly
$13 million each year. The company's debt now exceeds $130 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ The company, which is based in Toronto, used Canadian
accounting standards, which are looser and allow companies to
record profits sooner than the rules in the United States. For
example, the $29 million loss that Livent reported last year using
Canadian accounting would have shown up as $38 million using
American standards, according to the company's financial
statements.
</P>
<P>
   _ Analysts complained about an accounting method that the
company adopted in 1996 that in essence allowed Drabinsky to spend
as much as he wanted on a musical for costs such as advertising,
costumes and scenery without deducting them immediately from the
bottom line. Unlike most other Broadway productions, Livent was
able after changing its accounting methods to show a profit on a
musical even before ticket sales covered the costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accounting was aggressive,'' said David McFadgen, an
entertainment industry analyst with Griffiths McBurney and Partners
in Montreal. ``It just made no sense.'' McFadgen has long been
critical of the company's financial reporting and recalls how
Drabinsky once yelled at him on the phone for issuing a negative
report.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Livent's vendors had been complaining for years
that the company took months to pay its bills. For example, the
owners of shoemaking shops and fabric stores in Toronto, where
Livent creates most of its musicals, complained about Drabinsky's
slow bill-paying habits to one costume designer who was trying to
buy attire for another producer's show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every place I went, they would say, `You're not with Garth
Drabinsky, are you?''' said the costume designer, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. ``His reputation was the worst.'' A
spokesman for Drabinksky declined to comment.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Wohlers agrees to go on DL
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mark Wohlers returns to the Atlanta Braves today,
though maybe only on paper.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, in an arrangement worked out between the club and
Wohlers' agent, will recall Wohlers from his optional minor league
assignment in Class AAA Richmond, but only to place him on the
major league club's disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers, who has been in Richmond since Aug. 11, is expected to
spend only two or three days in town and then return to Richmond on
a medical rehab assignment. Asked how the Braves would specify
Wohlers' malady for placing him on the DL, general manager John
Schuerholz said the reliever's inability to pitch is justification
enough, under baseball rules.
</P>
<P>
   The move saves the team from having to demote another reliever.
The Braves have to send down somebody today when it activates
reliever Russ Springer off the DL. The move also keeps Wohlers from
losing any major league service time, which became an issue during
the right-hander's first optional assignment.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had been in touch with Wohlers and his New York-based
agent, Seth Levinson, to solve what had become a sticky roster
situation, particularly since playoff rosters must be turned in
Aug. 31. Moreover, the team saw no reason for Wohlers to try to
pitch in Atlanta, though as a five-year veteran he has the right to
claim his roster spot after his minor league assignment was up.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not about just wanting (Wohlers to stay down),''
Schuerholz said Thursday. ''It's really the only viable, meaningful
thing to do right now, so that he can keep pitching on a regular
basis, which is why we did it in the first place and why he
accepted. It's not as if we're forcing him to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Hail El Presidente
</P>
<P>
   The Braves will salute Dennis Martinez and his 244th career win
before Sunday's game with Los Angeles. The club is flying in the
43-year-old right-hander's family from Miami, as well as Nicaraguan
ambassador Aguirre Sacasa from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The club is also trying to arrange a video presentation with
Juan Marichal, the ex-San Francisco great whose record Martinez
broke as the game's winningest Latin American pitcher. A CNN camera
crew is currently on assignment in the Dominican Republic and the
team is trying to set up a video shoot to be replayed on the Turner
Field scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher in the slump
</P>
<P>
   Javy Lopez took a 4-for-28 slump into Thursday night, a result,
he says, of home-run fever. After hitting homers in three straight
games two weeks ago, Lopez has skewed his swing trying to reach the
fences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm impatient, that's the word,'' said Lopez, who has driven
in only one run since Aug. 8. ``I'm not swinging at good pitches.
Each time I feel like my swing is there but the pitch I'm swinging
at is no good.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch, ouch, etc.
</P>
<P>
   One notable factor in Andres Galarraga's setting the modern
franchise record for most times being hit by pitches: he needed
just 120 games to get hit 21 times while Jeff Blauser, who set the
record of 20 last season, did so in 151 games. The record-breaker,
which came off San Francisco's Julian Tavarez Tuesday night,
occurred right after Tavarez had intentionally walked Chipper Jones
and loaded the bases. Galarraga, who has been hit 133 times in his
career, cannot remember being plunked right after an intentional
walk before. His next target: the all-time record of 29, set by
Boston Beaneater Tommy Tucker in 1891.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like this record,'' Galarraga said. ``You can have
it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, since he began wearing his padded guard on his
left arm, he has been hit 11 times. Just once has the ball hit the
guard.

 &HT;    Leyritz on Wohlers: It's mental
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The man widely credited with transforming once-potent
Mark Wohlers into a struggling minor-league pitcher wants no part
of that distinction.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres' Jim Leyritz admits to turning the 1996
World Series, but Wohlers' problems, he insists, have nothing to do
with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Mark, it's all mental,'' said Leyritz, whose three-run
homer as a New York Yankee off Wohlers in the eighth inning of Game
4 erased a three-run deficit. The Yankees went on to win that game
and the Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard the talk that I'm the reason he's had it bad
lately, and I don't believe it at all,'' the Padres' part-time
catcher said Thursday night. ``I watched him the next year after my
homer mow down the entire National League (33 saves, 3.50 ERA). If
it was my hit, he wouldn't have had the year he did in '97. I'm
sure it's a mental thing with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz has seen a case similar to Wohlers' up close and
personal. And it is that experience that lets him know Wohlers'
troubles are in his head. In 1992 and '93, Leyritz caught a
promising young Yankee prospect named Sam Militello. The youngster
was brought up in the second half of the '92 season and started
nine games. He was projected as the next great Yankee hurler.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``he got hurt in spring training the next year,''
Leyritz recalled, ``and rushed back and was never the same. He got
mentally screwed up. You could catch him in the bullpen and he'd
throw the ball right to the spot. But as soon as you put a batter
in there, he was throwing to the backstop.''
</P>
<P>
   Militello was never heard from again. Wohlers, meanwhile,
continues his quest to find the strike zone and his confidence in
Class AAA Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he gets over it,'' Leyritz said. ``He's a good guy, a
great guy, which makes it harder to see him go through this. That
home run I hit will always be a burden for me and him. But I don't
think it affected him mentally to the point where he's struggling
so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz, a virtual unknown until he jettisoned Wohlers' slider
at old Atlanta Fulton County Stadium, called his bomb a ``burden,''
but it's really been the identifying play of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``That home run was big for both of us,'' he said. ``It was the
moment of my career.''

   NEW YORK _ The organizers of a planned Million Youth March sued
the city in federal court Thursday, saying that Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's refusal to grant them a permit to hold the event in
Harlem next month was both unconstitutional and reflective of the
mayor's discriminatory treatment of the city's black residents.
</P>
<P>
   The court action came as Harlem's most prominent black minister,
the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d, threw his support behind the march,
saying it was a perfect opportunity for young blacks to call
attention to issues that affect them, like unemployment and the
high cost of health care. Other civic leaders in Harlem have also
stepped up their support for the march in recent days, saying the
Mayor's resistance is an affront to their community.
</P>
<P>
   City officials have said they denied the permit because the
neighborhood cannot safely accommodate the one million participants
the organizers had said they expected.
</P>
<P>
   But the organizers, appearing before Judge Lewis Kaplan in
federal district court, said the city had refused to grant a permit
to hold the rally along Malcolm X Boulevard on Sept. 5 only because
of Giuliani's ``dislike for one of the conveners of the rally,''
Khalid Abdul Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
   They said it made no sense for the city to reject their permit
application, since the city regularly grants permits for even
larger rallies and parades. ``The only issue is whether or not the
Constitution applies to the people of Harlem,'' said Roger Wareham,
a lawyer for the march organizers. ``The city's policy is totally
arbitrary about who they grant permits to and when.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad and other organizers have billed the event as a show of
unity among young blacks from across the country, much like the
Million Man March that was held in Washington in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani has denounced it as a ``hate march,'' citing
anti-Semitic and anti-white remarks by Muhammad, a former top
official in the Nation of Islam. The mayor has repeatedly condemned
Muhammad and criticized the organizers' plan to invite gang members
to the rally.
</P>
<P>
   In court Thursday, lawyers for the city questioned why the march
organizers waited so long _ their permit application was rejected
in February _ to take their case before a judge. They said
Giuliani's opinion of Muhammad had nothing to do with the denial of
the permit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor did not decide whether the permit should be granted
or denied,'' said Michael Hess, the city's corporation counsel.
``This did not turn on the words of Mayor Giuliani one way or the
other.''

THE JOB-HOPPERS HAVE YET TO CONQUER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 23) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., N.Y. Calif.)   (af)  
 By SUSAN J. WELLS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Contrary to the popular belief that corporate downsizing and
job-hopping have eroded job stability, private studies and
government data show that average job tenure has changed remarkably
little in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   And workers, especially women, are generally feeling secure in
their jobs, with many enjoying the one-company careers widely
regarded as anachronisms, the studies suggest.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent study conducted by Watson Wyatt Worldwide,
a management consulting firm in Bethesda, Md., the average job
tenure at midsize and large companies was 13.4 years in the most
recent period _ 1995 to 1997 _ up from 12.6 years from 1990 to
1992.
</P>
<P>
   The study examined the employment records of one million workers
at 59 companies at the beginning and end of three different
five-year periods _ 1990 to 1995, 1991 to 1996 and 1992 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that the portion of workers who stayed with the
same employer for at least 10 years had risen significantly _ from
54 percent for 1990-92 to 57.6 percent in the most recent period.
The number of workers with 20-year tenure also climbed, from 25.6
percent to 26.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rush of concern over people losing or changing jobs due to
downsizing or layoffs or what have you would give the impression
that there's less stability than ever,'' said Sylvester Schieber,
director of research at Watson Wyatt. ``But this conventional
wisdom is simply not borne out by our research.'' The company said
its study was the first this decade to review employment records to
determine job tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for rising tenure is an aging work force. The
average age of employees in the Watson Wyatt study, for example,
rose to 41.9 years in the most recent period, from 40.7. ``The
older a person is, the more likely she is to stay with the same
job,'' Schieber said.
</P>
<P>
   Over a longer term, government data also show a slight increase
in median job tenure for workers. The median number of years that
workers had spent with their current employers rose from 3.5 years
in 1983 to 3.8 years in 1996, the most recent data available, the
Bureau of Labor Statistics reported.
</P>
<P>
   Differences show up, however, between the sexes. The job tenure
of men age 16 and older declined slightly, from 4.1 years in 1983
to 4.0 in 1996. But tenure for women has risen consistently, from
3.1 years to a record 3.5 years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, job tenure could rise in coming years, as the effects
of downsizing ebb. In a survey released last week, the bureau found
that a smaller percentage of workers had been laid off in the last
three years _ eight million, or one of every 15 jobholders _ than
in any other period this decade. But layoffs are still
significantly higher than they were in the 1980s and could rise
again if the economy slows.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the trends, Henry S. Farber, an economist at Princeton
University who studies job-tenure patterns, said: ``There's just no
basis for the idea that the great American job is dead. The answer
is that long-term jobs in the United States are as common as ever.
The difference is in who holds them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenure rates tend to move with the business cycle, decreasing in
strong economic times, for example, as companies expand _ thus
increasing their hiring and diluting their average tenure rate.
During good times, experienced workers also have more opportunities
to change employers and take better jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But tenure can rise in weak or recessionary times, as older
workers tend to be the last to be let go, leaving companies with a
higher proportion of longer-term employees.
</P>
<P>
   In some industries, like the labor-starved high-technology
sector, high tenure rates can even be frowned upon. In an survey of
250 companies by Towers Perrin, a consulting firm in New York,
those that rated technology as key to their businesses _ one-third
of the respondents _ generally reported the highest levels of
turnover. And some technology businesses actively recruit workers
who have moved from company to company, seeing such job-hopping as
essential in keeping skills up to date, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Dudley Brown, managing director of Bridgegate LLC, an executive
search consulting firm in Irvine, Calif., said it was easier for
technology workers to move from job to job because of the
industry's focus on product development cycles.
</P>
<P>
   Once a new software product is completed, for example, the
project's employees might prefer working on new products at other
companies to sticking around and developing upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   While companies ``don't necessarily see a lot of job-hopping on
a resume as desirable'' he said, ``in our experience, people don't
tend to stick around beyond five years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're probably most valuable to the company during your first
year or two, when you're still thinking out of the box, trying to
change and improve things,'' Brown added. ``Companies want that
freshness _ especially in tech people.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line in his business, he said, is that ``people buy
resumes the same way they buy cereal: if you've come out of a No.
1, 2 or 3 firm, you're a hot commodity, you're popular and everyone
wants to try you.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: Long-term workers are more expensive for
employers to keep. Not surprisingly, the Watson Wyatt study found
that costs for pay and benefits _ like health insurance, pensions,
401(k) plans and paid time off, were substantially higher in
companies with higher average tenure.
</P>
<P>
   If the trends continue, will employers have to look for ways to
shave the costs of high-tenure staff? ``It should be a wake-up
call,'' Schieber said. ``Older workers may be more expensive to
maintain on the payroll, but companies cannot afford to simply let
so much talent go.''

COWBOYS NEED TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rare is the worker who hasn't tried to please a new boss.
</P>
<P>
   We want the new person in charge to think that we always dress
this nicely, arrive this promptly and work this feverishly. We want
the new boss to see that we haven't lost our fastball. We want to
make the new boss smile.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, therefore, have to be wondering what in the name of
Rod Hill must their new guy be thinking.
</P>
<P>
   With only eight quarters of dissecting left in the preseason
lab, Chan Gailey must be wondering whether he has a prince or a
frog. He knows the Cowboys' reputations. He has seen the glint from
their Super Bowl rings.
</P>
<P>
   But, having heard the fans' whistles of disapproval Monday night
in Mexico City, Gailey must be wondering when his alleged
contenders are going to stand up and make the boss some coffee.
Tomorrow night in St. Louis? Next week in Jacksonville?
</P>
<P>
   Opening day against the Arizona Cardinals?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not where we want to be,'' Gailey said this week. ``But
we still have time.''
</P>
<P>
   In two weeks, alas, that disclaimer will no longer be valid.
Time is wasting. The Cowboys need to show something immediately or,
failing that, even sooner.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cowboys' platinum lineup scheduled to perform for at
least one half against the Rams tomorrow, a vibrant pulse must be
spotted. Perhaps even a third-down conversion or two.
</P>
<P>
   It would do wonders for an offense which, frankly, couldn't move
the ball Monday night even when it was upwind from the mariachi
band. Over the past two weeks of NFL preseason, the Cowboys are
averaging less than 10 first downs and 170 yards total per game.
</P>
<P>
   The boss is not impressed. The boss, you see, also has a boss.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jones can say all he wants about Gailey's character and
credentials. In the middle of August, it's easy for an owner to
stand by his man.
</P>
<P>
   But if the first-teamers don't dazzle the critics tomorrow
night, people are going to wonder what the owner really thinks. A
lackluster two periods would almost make it imperative that Gailey
come back in the preseason finale and play the starters for a full
half again.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it would take a stout fan to defend Gailey. With
another bad outing in St. Louis, Gailey's new offense could and
should come under inevitable attack. Maybe it just doesn't ``fit''
Troy Aikman's style. Maybe the Phi Beta Fumbla Cowboys can't learn
it. Maybe it's Barry Switzer's fault.
</P>
<P>
   As the new guy in town, Gailey was due for a mandatory
six-month-or-so media honeymoon. You've seen the stories, the ones
where we wrote about his Georgia accent and Bible collection rather
than his offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   But Gailey, let me suggest, lost part of his honeymoon charm
when he downplayed and then clammed up about the Everett McIver
stabbing. Nothing woos the media like down-home candor. But clam
up, as your team screws up, and the head coach becomes the easy
target. (See Switzer, circa 1994.)
</P>
<P>
   That may not be fair, but it's fact. And history tells us that
players won't go out of their way to correct that. (See Switzer,
circa 1997.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have time''?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But to spoiled Cowboys fans, it's always later than you
think.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it isn't just Gailey's offense that will be under
heightened scrutiny tomorrow, but the new coach himself. Somebody _
somebody not named Jones _ needs to start believing in this new
``era'' soon, or people are going to wonder whatever happened to
good, old Terry Donahue.
</P>
<P>
   To Gailey's credit, he has been, for the most part, a pillar of
consistency this summer, even if his team hasn't. Forget the McIver
thing, where Owner Jones orchestrated the official reaction. Gailey
hasn't played favorites. He reportedly has kept players and coaches
alike on edge.
</P>
<P>
   They all want to please the new boss. But when?
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys need it to be tomorrow night. Just as importantly,
so does the new coach.
</P>

CLINTON JUGGLED PERSONAL, POLICY AFFAIRS OVER WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton informed his wife of his
extramarital affair with Monica S. Lewinsky and prepared his
unprecedented testimony before a federal grand jury last weekend,
he also gathered his senior national security advisers and plotted
his strategy to do battle with terrorist forces abroad, aides said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   This combination marks a breathtaking juxtaposition of policy
and personal life. Since Monday, when the nation became transfixed
in the aftermath of his televised confession, Clinton and a few
elite aides harbored a secret: they planned to lob more than 100
cruise missiles at suspected terrorist sites in Sudan and
Afghanistan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The decisive meeting to strike came in the White House last
Friday, officials said, after Clinton's national security adviser
Samuel R.Berger and CIA Director George Tenet concluded that Saudi
millionaire Osama bin Laden was responsible for the deadly bombings
of two US embassies in Africa on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, Tenet, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen and Joint
Chiefs of Staff Chairman Hugh Shelton gathered with Clinton in the
White House to lay out their proposal for a missile attack that
would involve no troops and put no Americans at risk. The targets
were a suspected chemical weapons plant in Sudan that US officials
believe was financed by bin Laden, and his sprawling terrorist
training center in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   At the Friday meeting, Clinton approved the proposal with one
caveat: He wanted the ability to halt the operation until 6 a.m. on
the morning of the attack, when he would be secluded in a
beachhouse outside of Edgartown on Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   The operation was perhaps most notable for its secrecy.
Virtually no White House political or domestic aides were apprised
of the plans, except for Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles. Members of
the congressional intelligence committees were intentionally kept
out of the loop. Only Clinton's most senior national security
aides, as well as the four highest-ranking congressional leaders,
were kept informed, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Martha's Vineyard, Clinton worked the telephones overnight
Thursday, talking repeatedly with Berger in Washington and placing
a call to Vice President Al Gore, who was vacationing in Hawaii. At
3 a.m., Clinton gave final orders for the plan, and the 6 a.m.
deadline passed without any decision to halt.
</P>
<P>
   The operation began at 11:30 a.m., with missiles fired US ships
in the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea. Targets were struck at 1:30
p.m. The missile fire continued for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   At the press filing center in the Edgartown School, press
secretary Michael McCurry was briefing the gathered members of the
news media on Clinton's birthday celebration from the prior night
when his pager vibrated. He looked at the message, then told the
group: ``I need to do a very important piece of business. In about
10 minutes, the president will be here. He has an announcement he
has to make on a national security matter.''
</P>
<P>
   On the drive between the house and the school, Clinton
telephoned House Speaker Newt Gingrich to inform him of the
strikes. At the school, he ducked into an office and placed another
call to Senate majority leader Trent Lott. He also reached Senate
minority leader Tom Daschle.

TRANSMISSION-ONLY COMPANIES MAY FIND A MIDDLE NICHE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 23) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif.)   (af)  
 By MICHAEL PARRISH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One reason for the spikes in electricity prices this summer was
a series of bottlenecks in the nation's transmission system _ the
towers and high-voltage lines that carry power from generation
plants to utilities and, increasingly, between sellers and buyers
in the fledgling wholesale power market.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators now require utilities that own sections of the
transmission grid to transport power produced by any source, even
competitors. However, they can decline to do so if the extra
electricity threatens to overload their stretch of the system.
Several utilities with transmission lines feeding the Midwest used
that argument this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The utilities' refusal to allow some power over their lines
``impeded the flow of power,'' said Edward J. Tirello, a utilities
analyst at BT Alex. Brown. ``You have to have physical
deliverability of the assets.''
</P>
<P>
   The summer's problems have intensified the debate over how to
restructure the transmission business. Utilities in California, New
York, New England and elsewhere have created independent system
operators, or I.S.O.'s, nonprofit administrators of regional chunks
of the grid. But critics within and close to the industry see ISOs
as bureaucratic halfway measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``ISOs are going to end up being a transitional mechanism,''
predicted Steven M. Fetter, managing director of the global power
group at Fitch IBCA, the credit-rating firm.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the critics propose a lucrative new kind of utility,
called a transco, that could be attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
   A transco would be a pure transmission company and would hold a
monopoly in its region. It would be likely to be regulated, at
least in the beginning. It would receive financial incentives from
regulators based on how much power it carried, which would
encourage efficiency and expansion of the grid to meet rising
demand.
</P>
<P>
   Some utilities are already positioning themselves for transcos,
said Daniele M. Seitz, energy analyst at Warburg Dillon Read, as
they see money to be made in the middle. Just as pipeline companies
have been big winners under natural-gas deregulation, she noted,
``the large electric companies are definitely saying, `Hey,
transmission could be a good business.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Companies widely expected to transform themselves into transcos,
if the concept develops, include the Entergy Corp., with operations
in four states; the American Electric Power Co., which already owns
22,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines; the Northern
States Power Co., and possibly the Firstenergy Corp. and Utilicorp
United Inc.
</P>
<P>
   James J. Hoecker, chairman of the federal energy regulatory
commission, who expects to release the commission's analysis of
June electricity shortages in about two weeks, agreed that the ISOs
and other new industry institutions ``are a work in progress.''
</P>
<P>
   But he cautioned that bottlenecks were not the only problem in
the Midwest and that transcos, as monopolies, could introduce
drawbacks. ``When you have monopoly facilities,'' he said, prices
often tend to go higher.

NORTHEAST REPUBLICANS WARM UP TO GINGRICH 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1996, Democratic candidates across the nation
were reading from the same play book. Attack the Contract With
America. Call every Republican a radical conservative. And whenever
possible, accuse opponents of being foot soldiers in Speaker Newt
Gingrich's rebel brigade.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy was not a rousing success in much of the country.
But in the left-leaning Northeast, it was instrumental in defeating
six Republican members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   So it is one of this year's political oddities that across the
Northeast, Republicans are unrepentantly embracing Gingrich, even
as Democrats prepare to bash them for it and opinion polls show
that the speaker remains about as popular up north as Sherman is
down South.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, who castigated
Gingrich for hurting the party in 1996, traveled to Georgia for a
$1,000-a-head fund-raiser with the speaker as host at a country
club in Gingrich's hometown of Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Gingrich visited the Hudson Valley town of New
Windsor to speak at a fund-raiser for Rep. Sue W. Kelly,
R-Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   And before Election Day, Gingrich, his party's most prolific
fund-raiser, is expected to venture into the region several more
times to stump for candidates in tight races, Republican officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are pleasantly puzzled that Republicans are not
fleeing from Gingrich in an election year. But moderate Republicans
offer several reasons why they stay close to their speaker. It is
not just that he is an extremely effective fund-raiser, they say,
but also because he is arguably the only top Republican leader who
listens to their concerns. And, they proudly contend, he needs
them, both to remain speaker and to build support for a possible
presidential campaign in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond such politicking, centrist Republicans like Christopher
Shays from Connecticut, Sherwood L. Boehlert from New York and
Robert D. Franks from New Jersey, all of whom decry their party's
conservative drift, call Gingrich a visionary, a mesmerizing
speaker and a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I care?'' said Ms. Kelly when asked how she felt that
Gingrich may be burned in effigy by New York Democrats again this
year. ``No. Because Newt is also a symbol of rebirth in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, it is not as risky for moderates to cozy up to Gingrich
these days because he is not as politically radioactive as in 1995
and 1996, when a budget-related government shutdown and an ethics
investigation into his finances made Gingrich a useful Democratic
symbol of Republican excesses.
</P>
<P>
   But members of Congress and many political analysts say another,
more symbiotic dynamic is at work here. Moderates genuinely like
Gingrich, they say, because he alone among the House's conservative
upper echelon listens to them seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people he's our link to the decision-makers,'' said
Boehlert, who has clashed famously with Gingrich and House
conservatives over environmental policies. ``He is the guy who will
listen to the moderates. He doesn't always agree, but he listens.''
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert, who is from Utica, said he was amazed to sell out a
fund-raiser with Gingrich during a snowstorm in 1996, when the
speaker's popularity was plumbing new depths. ``I had to return
checks,'' Boehlert said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gingrich needs the moderates to stay in power.
Centrist Republicans like Rep. Nancy L. Johnson of New Britain,
Conn., cast crucial votes in 1989 to elect Gingrich as House whip,
his stepping stone to becoming speaker. And moderates like Shays
warned Gingrich last year about a coup by conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts also say that if Gingrich is serious about
running for president in 2000, he must mend his tattered image in
the Northeast, a goal that moderate Republicans could help him
achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican and Democratic politicians said they thought
Presidential motivations were behind Gingrich's offer to do a
fund-raiser for D'Amato, who already has $12 million in campaign
money in the bank. D'Amato is the paramount leader of New York's
Republican Party, and his support, or at least lack of opposition,
could be essential to Gingrich's presidential aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is a large electoral-vote state,'' said Johnny
Isacson, an Atlanta real estate broker who ran for governor as a
Republican in 1990. ``Senator D'Amato is an influential senator. It
doesn't hurt to have done a fund-raiser for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's 50-minute speech at Ms. Kelly's fund-raiser last
month had the feel of an old-fashioned stem-winder. The speaker
took a few well-aimed shots at liberal Democrats and then went into
a recitation of bipartisan themes: trimming government waste,
saving Social Security, cutting taxes, fighting drug abuse and
improving schools.
</P>
<P>
   There were lots of broad ideas, few nagging details and almost
none of the harsh oratory that peppered his speeches in 1995. More
than a few of the self-described Republican moderates in the crowd
left impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came expecting to see a man with horns,'' said Fred
Paschkes, 73, an insurance broker from Pound Ridge, N.Y. ``I will
look at him more closely from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to both Gingrich and D'Amato denied that presidential
positioning was behind the Georgia fund-raiser. Other Republicans
suggested that D'Amato, making a small concession to Gingrich's
unpopularity in New York by traveling to Georgia, accepted the
speaker's assistance because he never thinks he has enough money
for a campaign and because Atlanta is home to regional banks and
credit unions that are regulated by the Senate Banking Committee.
D'Amato is chairman of that committee.
</P>
<P>
   Though Democrats are not gearing up to attack Gingrich as
lavishly as in 1996, many candidates are gleeful that their
Republican opponents remain close to the speaker, noting that
Gingrich's approval rating remains below 35 percent in many
Northeastern states.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still have Democrats whose only applause line in this
state is conjuring up Newt Gingrich,'' said John Zogby, a pollster
from Utica. ``It still works.''
</P>
<P>
   The moment that news of the Georgia fund-raiser became public,
all three of D'Amato's major Democratic opponents, former Rep.
Geraldine Ferraro, Rep. Charles Schumer and Mark Green, the New
York City public advocate, released statements attacking D'Amato as
a Gingrich Republican.

CLINTON JUGGLED PERSONAL, POLICY AFFAIRS OVER WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton informed his wife of his
extramarital affair with Monica S. Lewinsky and prepared his
unprecedented testimony before a federal grand jury last weekend,
he also gathered his senior national security advisers and plotted
his strategy to do battle with terrorist forces abroad, aides said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   This combination marks a breathtaking juxtaposition of policy
and personal life. Since Monday, when the nation became transfixed
in the aftermath of his televised confession, Clinton and a few
elite aides harbored a secret: they planned to lob more than 100
cruise missiles at suspected terrorist sites in Sudan and
Afghanistan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The decisive meeting to strike came in the White House last
Friday, officials said, after Clinton's national security adviser
Samuel R.Berger and CIA Director George Tenet concluded that Saudi
millionaire Osama bin Laden was responsible for the deadly bombings
of two US embassies in Africa on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, Tenet, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen and Joint
Chiefs of Staff Chairman Hugh Shelton gathered with Clinton in the
White House to lay out their proposal for a missile attack that
would involve no troops and put no Americans at risk. The targets
were a suspected chemical weapons plant in Sudan that US officials
believe was financed by bin Laden, and his sprawling terrorist
training center in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   At the Friday meeting, Clinton approved the proposal with one
caveat: He wanted the ability to halt the operation until 6 a.m. on
the morning of the attack, when he would be secluded in a
beachhouse outside of Edgartown on Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   The operation was perhaps most notable for its secrecy.
Virtually no White House political or domestic aides were apprised
of the plans, except for Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles. Members of
the congressional intelligence committees were intentionally kept
out of the loop. Only Clinton's most senior national security
aides, as well as the four highest-ranking congressional leaders,
were kept informed, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Martha's Vineyard, Clinton worked the telephones overnight
Thursday, talking repeatedly with Berger in Washington and placing
a call to Vice President Al Gore, who was vacationing in Hawaii. At
3 a.m., Clinton gave final orders for the plan, and the 6 a.m.
deadline passed without any decision to halt.
</P>
<P>
   The operation began at 11:30 a.m., with missiles fired US ships
in the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea. Targets were struck at 1:30
p.m. The missile fire continued for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   At the press filing center in the Edgartown School, press
secretary Michael McCurry was briefing the gathered members of the
news media on Clinton's birthday celebration from the prior night
when his pager vibrated. He looked at the message, then told the
group: ``I need to do a very important piece of business. In about
10 minutes, the president will be here. He has an announcement he
has to make on a national security matter.''
</P>
<P>
   On the drive between the house and the school, Clinton
telephoned House Speaker Newt Gingrich to inform him of the
strikes. At the school, he ducked into an office and placed another
call to Senate majority leader Trent Lott. He also reached Senate
minority leader Tom Daschle.

SCHOUREK DEBUT LEAVES RED SOX BEHIND ROYALS, 8-2 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ There was a time when Pete Schourek was
mentioned in the same breath as Greg Maddux and nobody blinked an
eye.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, after he was pinned with an 8-2 loss to the Kansas
City Royals Thursday afternoon in his first start for the Red Sox,
Schourek's name remains linked to the company of Kid Korea, the
Dominican Mystery Man, and other pitchers who have faltered in
their auditions at the tail end of the Boston rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't exactly the start I envisioned,'' said Schourek,
who took the mound with a 2-0 lead fashioned by Mike Stanley's
third home run in two days but was unable to hold it for more than
two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek gave up a three-run homer to Terry Pendleton, who
hadn't gone deep in more than three months (April 30) and probably
will retire at the end of the season. The lefthander was then
touched for two more runs on three singles and a sacrifice fly in
the fourth, his final inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can pitch better than that,'' Schourek said, ``and,
obviously, longer than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, winners of three in a row and looking for thier
ninth victory this season against the Royals, which would have
matched their high against Kansas City since 1969, instead
succumbed to Royals righthander Hipolito Pichardo and three
relievers.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals, who own the worst home record in the American League
and were in the midst of being auctioned off even as they prepared
for Thursday's game, ended a five-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley's homer, which came with two outs and Mo Vaughn aboard,
was followed by singles by Troy O'Leary and Darren Bragg. The Red
Sox appeared intent on putting the Royals away early, just as they
had done the night before in their 11-1 win at Kauffman Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But with Nomar Garciaparra on the bench getting a rare day off,
the Red Sox managed just two more singles and a total of three more
runners the rest of this searing afternoon. Pichardo lasted only
through the fifth because of a bad elbow, but he set down the last
11 batters he faced, a succession of outs that grew to 15 until
Bragg's one-out single off Scott Service in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   No Boston runner advanced as far as third after Stanley's 27th
homer, a career high for the recycled Sox veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pichardo pitched good against us,'' said Red Sox mnanager Jimy
Williams, whose team began the day seven games ahead of the Orioles
in the American League wild-card race. ``It was hot out there. They
got going and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Schourek had no illusions about what was at stake in his first
start in three weeks, his duties with the Red Sox having been
limited to two relief appearances since he came from Houston. ``I'm
disappointed with it,'' said the lefthander, who just three years
ago was runner-up to Maddux for the National League Cy Young Award.
``Obviously, we're in the wild-card race, we need wins. Since I've
been here, I've been in three games and I've got two losses. That's
not exactly the impression I wanted to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Schourek set down the next eight Royals in order after
Pendleton, the 35-year-old third baseman who last season played
with Schourek in Cincinnati and before that had hit him at a .429
clip, turned on a first-pitch fastball and hit it over the
left-field fence to make it 3-2. Schourek struck out three in that
span, including the Royals' Nos. 3 and 4 hitters, Jose Offerman and
Dean Palmer, in succession.
</P>
<P>
   But after Palmer went down swinging, Pendleton blooped a single
over the head of rookie second basemen Donnie Sadler, Jeff Conine
grounded a single off Sadler's glove, and Jermaine Dye followed
with another ground-ball hit through the right side that made it
4-2. A fifth run scored on Sal Fasano's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals strung together four straight singles in the fifth
off reliever Derek Lowe, including a bunt on which Lowe and Stanley
crossed signals, and broke it open with three more runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hadn't started in three weeks, he was out of whack from his
routine, so we knew the probability existed that he would have a
rough first start,'' pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said in his
critique of Schourek. ``But once he gets into our program and our
routine, I think he'll be fine. I think he'll help us a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan, who has watched would-be starters Jin Ho Cho and
Robinson Checo, among others, fail in situations similar to
Schourek's, blamed himself for Pendleton's homer. He failed to
inform rookie catcher Jason Varitek that Pendleton likes to swing
at the first pitch with runners in scoring postion. The worst thing
Schourek could do was throw him a fastball inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``That home run was the killer for us,'' said Kerrigan. ``We had
momentum going on our side from the night before, we jump ahead
today, and Pendleton hits the home run. My fault.''
</P>
<P>
   While Varitek may be a rookie, Schourek is hardly a babe in the
woods. He admitted he knew of Pendleton's tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I hadn't faced him in a while,'' he said. ``I left it over
the plate a little too much. Especially beating them the way we did
last night, to give them three runs back like I did knocked the
wind out of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's on to the dome in Minnesota, under the big top, where
there is no wind and no heat. Except the kind being generated from
Baltimore.

US BLASTS TERRORIST TARGETS IN AFGHANISTAN, SUDAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w, a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ US forces launched a pair of night missile attacks
Thursday on what officials described as a ``terrorist university''
in the hills of Afghanistan and a terrorist-sponsored chemical
plant in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes were in direct retaliation for the bombings of two
US embassies in Africa two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The action came as US intelligence officials reported that key
terrorist leaders from across the region planned to gather Thursday
at the Afghanistan training facility, considered a preeminent
terrorist matrix in the world. It also followed intelligence gained
by US officials anticipating a fresh round of terrorist attacks on
American targets, possibly more overseas embassies.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton gave final orders for the attacks around dawn
Thursday from his borrowed vacation compound on Martha's Vineyard,
made a hasty announcement in Edgartown, Mass., on the island, early
Thursday afternoon, then rushed back to Washington for meetings in
the White House situation room to deliver an Oval Office address.
The operation had been planned in secret in the prior two weeks,
senior officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we have struck back,'' Clinton said in the makeshift
briefing room at the Edgartown School before he left. He added:
``Terrorists must have no doubt that in the face of their threats,
America will protect its citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   From the Oval Office, Clinton said, ``Let our actions today send
this message loud and clear: There are no expendable American
targets. There will be no sanctuary for terrorists. We will defend
our people, our interests and our values.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton spoke from Martha's Vineyard and shuttled back to the
White House, former intern Monica Lewinsky appeared again before
the federal grand jury investigating her relationship with the
president -- in a stark contrast that prompted two Republican
senators, Dan Coats of Indiana and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania,
to openly question Clinton's motives in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an obvious issue here of whether there were any
diversionary motives involved,'' said Specter.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican and Democratic leaders, who had been kept
apprised of the plans by White House national security officials,
offered universal and strong support for the operation, as is
customary in the wake of US military strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US did exactly the right thing,'' said House Speaker Newt
Gingrich. ``We cannot allow a terrorist group to attack US
embassies and do nothing. We cannot afford to have people think
they can kill Americans without any consequence. This was exactly
the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the timing of the strikes, Secretary of Defense
William Cohen said, ``The only motivation driving this action today
was our absolute obligation to protect the American people from
terrorist activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the US targeted terrorist operations and sites
financed by Osama bin Laden, a multimillionaire Saudi exile who has
openly declared war on the United States and is the main suspect in
the twin embassy bombings in the capitals of Tanzania and Kenya on
August 7 -- attacks in which a dozen Americans and over 200
Africans were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's strikes, using Tomahawk cruise missiles with 1,000
pound warheads launched from ships in the Red and Arabian seas,
were aimed against a sprawling paramilitary training center in
Afghanistan operated and funded by bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   The second target was the Shifa Pharmaceutical plant in Sudan's
capital city of Khartoum. The facililty is suspected of making the
chemical agent used in the production of a deadly nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know with great certainty it produces the penultimate
chemical that goes into VX nerve gas,'' said Samuel (Sandy) Berger,
Clinton's national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The first missiles rained down at about 1:30 p.m. EDT, which is
7:30 p.m. in Sudan and 10 p.m. in Afghanistan. The attacks
continued for about an hour, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Sudanese television footage showed the Shifa plant engulfed in
flames, with significant damage. Bloodied men were carried out on
stretchers, though there was no definitive estimate of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they intentionally bombed the
plant, located in an industrial complex, in the evening in order to
minimize casulualties among workers.
</P>
<P>
   US officials said they are uncertain how much damage the
missiles caused at the Afghanistan training sites, which included a
storage facility, a weapons training center, administrative offices
and housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``These bases provide refuges for terrorists and train
terrorists for tactics and use of international weapons,'' said
General Hugh Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how many terrorists, if any, were killed in the
raids, which were launched under the cover of darkness. US
officials stopped short of declaring the mission a success, and
they admitted they did not know if bin Laden had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no idea of bin Laden's whereabouts or whether he was
in the camp at that time,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Taliban, the ruling party of Afghanistan,
said bin Laden was not at the site at the time and was not killed.
After the attacks, the FBI immediately warned all local law
enforcement agencies to be on a heightened level of alert for
possible terrorist retaliation on US soil. Embassy officials abroad
were also warned, as were US travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, most US diplomats and their families fled the
embassy in Pakistan out of a fear for another embassy bombing. This
move came as US officials gathered key intelligence data that
showed more attacks were planned in the terrorist world, officials
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The operation was executed with such extraordinary secrecy that
no US troops or ships were moved in the attack for fear of calling
attention to the plan. Also, no senior US national security
officials traveled to Martha's Vineyard this week to meet Clinton
so as not to alert news reporters covering the president.

   The New York Times has moved the following stories about U.S.
missile attacks on suspected terrorist sites in Afghanistan and
Sudan. This recap expands upon the previously-filed
ATTACK-ADVISORY, with more-detailed story summaries and art
information.
</P>
<P>
   Lede story: ATTACK-U.S. (Washington) _ Dozens of U.S. cruise
missiles struck targets in Afghanistan and Sudan on Thursday in
what President Clinton described as an act of self-defense against
imminent terrorist plots and of fearsome retribution for the
bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa two weeks ago. By James
Bennet. WITH PHOTOS and GRAPHICS.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-BINLADEN (Washington) _ How Osama bin Laden, the youngest
son of a construction magnate from Yemen, became the world's most
feared sponsor of terrorism. The religious and ideological roots of
his rage lie in the 1980s, when he worked side by side with the CIA
backing the Afghan rebels. When that battle was over, he and his
fellow holy warriors went to work on the U.S. By Tim Weiner. WITH
MAP.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-CONGRESS (Washington) _ A cherished axiom of U.S.
diplomacy is that the opposition party supports the president when
missiles are flying. Thursday it worked, more or less. Most
congressional leaders, from Speaker Newt Gingrich to such reliable
Clinton critics as Sen. Jesse Helms, rallied around the
commander-in-chief. But in the surreal and cinematic atmosphere
that suffused Washington this week, a handful of voices on Capitol
Hill cried foul. By Todd S. Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-ASSESS (Undated) _ In the war against terrorism,
experience suggests that any operation, whether an assassination or
the sort of strike launched by the United States, has the quality
of damned-if-you-do-and-damned-if-you-don't. By Serge Schmemann.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-SECURITY (Washington) _ The U.S. on Thursday issued a new
worldwide warning to Americans and diplomatic personnel ``to
exercise much greater caution than usual'' following U.S. military
strikes against suspected terrorist targets in Afghanistan and
Sudan. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-MILITARY (Washington) _ The U.S. attacked targets in
Afghanistan and the Sudan with roughly 70 cruise missiles fired
from Navy ships in the Arabian and Red Seas timed to strike their
targets simultaneously, senior administration and military
officials said.The missiles struck at precisely 1:30 p.m. ET, after
dark settled over their targets, themselves more than 2,500 miles
apart, the officials said. By Steven Lee Myers. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-ALBANIA (Tirana) _ Arrests in Albania show links to the
African embassy bombings: In a series of lightning raids with the
Albanian secret police this summer, U.S. intelligence agents appear
to have thwarted a bomb plot against the U.S. Embassy here. They
also seem to have broken up a ring of Egyptian Islamic terrorists
using this nation's anarchy to set up a base. By John Kifner.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-EVIDENCE (Washington) _ President Clinton ordered strikes
on terrorist-linked facilities in Sudan and Afghanistan after
obtaining credible evidence that leading members of the
international terrorist network sponsored by Saudi exile Osama bin
Laden, who U.S. officials believe was behind the bombings of two
U.S. embassies in Africa, would be gathering Thursday at a
terrorist camp in Afghanistan to plan further attacks against the
U.S. By James Risen.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-SUDAN (Nairobi) _ U.S.-Sudanese tensions finally erupt
into open warfare. The air strike against a drug factory in Sudan
on Thursday marked the first act of open warfare in a
long-simmering cold war between the U.S. and the Islamic regime in
Khartoum. By James C. McKinley. WITH MAP.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-MEDIA (Undated) _ After a week of what felt like nonstop
talk about sex, ties and audiotape involving President Clinton and
Monica Lewinsky, television screens were overtaken Thursday by news
of a different shock value. By Lawrie Mifflin.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-MIDEAST-REACT (Jerusalem) _ Israel was quick to
congratulate the U.S. night for its missile attacks on suspected
terrorist bases, but the early reaction from many other governments
in the Middle East was a notable silence. British Prime Minister
Tony Blair was alone among European leaders in expressing strong
support. By Douglas Jehl.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-WAG (New York) _ Is life imitating art? `Wag the Dog'
springs to many minds. Beginning with a reporter's question early
Thursday afternoon to Defense Secretary Cohen about the film ``Wag
the Dog,'' we cast a wide net in search of reaction. By Frank
Bruni. WITH PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-GAS (Undted) _ VX, the chemical nerve agent that the U.S.
alleges Sudan was preparing to make, is one of the deadliest nerve
agents known, especially when applied to the skin. A 10 mg drop on
the skin can kill an adult in 15 minutes. By Judith Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-YORK (New York) _ Once they received word that the U.S.
had bombed targets in Afghanistan and the Sudan, New York City
officials immediately tightened security in a routine that Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani acknowledged has become all too familiar in recent
years. By Dan Barry.

US STRIKE: REQUIRED MOVE OR MEDIA PLOY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As news of US military attacks on terrorist sites
abroad spread Thursday, so did questions about whether the White
House may have timed the operation to change the subject dominating
the news: President Clinton's affair with Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Dan Coats, an Indiana Republican, called the timing of
the military missions ``suspect.'' Senator Arlen Specter, a
Pennsylvania Republican, said it was fair to ask ``whether there
was any diversionary motive involved'' in the US attack.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials denied it. But certainly the
juxtaposition of a humiliated president retreating to a secluded
vacation spot on Martha's Vineyard Tuesday with the return Thursday
of a take-charge commmander in chief did not disappoint Clinton
image-minders.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did they lament that for a day, at least, the newspapers and
newscasts would feature foreign affairs rather than domestic ones.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Clinton stepped into the media center on Martha's
Vineyard to make his surprise announcement of the military attacks
at the same time that Lewinsky, a former White House intern, was
testifying to a grand jury in Washington for a second time about
her sexual relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that the president or the White House has been
particularly following her business today,'' White House spokesman
Michael McCurry told reporters on Martha's Vineyard.

<P>
   In Washington, a reporter asked Defense Secretary William Cohen
if the timing of the military attack was influenced at all by the
president's problems at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only motivation driving this action today was our aboslute
obligation to protect the American people from terrorist
activities,'' Cohen answered. ``That was the sole motivation. No
other consideration has been involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most lawmakers from both parties, House Speaker Newt
Gingrich supported the president, saying it was ``sick'' to suggest
there was any motive other than national security that drove the
president's decision. ``It was the right thing to do at the right
time,'' the GOP leader said.
</P>
<P>
   By last evening, Spector said he had talked to administration
officials and was convinced that the attack was justified.
</P>
<P>
   But Coats, a member of both the Senate Intelligence and Armed
Services committees, wondered why the operation hadn't come last
week or next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is extrordinary, coming when the president is in
political extremis. People are raising legitmate questions about
the attacks, here and around the globe,'' Coats said.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Martin Meehan, a Massachusetets Democrat, said
the senators' statements were ``unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one thing for a radio talk-show host to bring up such
things, but for a US senator to do it is outrageous,'' Meehan said.
``The bombing of our embassy was very real. That 260 people were
murdered in Kenya and Tanzania was real. The movie was fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``movie'' most talked about Thursday was ``Wag the Dog,'' a
recent film in which Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman, portraying
two operatives in the White House, concoct a phony military
operation to divert attention and restore the popularity of a
president whose future is imperiled by a sexual encounter with a
Girl Scout.
</P>
<P>
   To some, a ``Wag the Dog'' scenario seemed just too cynical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with a spin machine like the one in this White House, I
would be very wary of jumping to any conclusions like that,'' said
Howard Kurtz, the Washington Post media critic and author of ``Spin
Cycle: Inside the White House Propaganda Machine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my opinion that it is not within the realm of possibility
that the president would engage in a Hollywoodized version of
reality, or send young men and women into battle, in order to cover
his embarrassment,'' said Marvin Kalb, director of the Shorenstein
Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy at Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the fact that people would even raise the issue of `Wag
the Dog' is a sad testimony to the cynicism which exists in the
American population, particularly after the president has been
lying to the people for seven months,'' Kalb said.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam War gave Americans good reason to challenge the
Pentagon on its judgment and veracity, and ever since Watergate
Americans have been skeptical about whether their president was
telling the whole truth at all times.
</P>
<P>
   But fresh from a public admission that for months he lied to his
family, friends, and the country about an ``inappropriate
relationship'' with Lewinsky, the president was sure to face
credibility problems as he led the nation into an unexpected and
uncertain military operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything the president does from now on will be subject to
this kind of skepticism, and all you can say is that he has brought
it on himself,'' said Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at the
Brookings Institution, a private group.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Gaffney, director of the Center for Security Policy, a
private group, said, ``Given what is at stake here, which is
nothing less than the security of the United States, I hope that
the president is acting in a sober way, that his intelligence was
good, and that it was done for a cause, not `Wag the Dog' effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, critics of the US action from the Sudan to Iran said
Clinton was trying to divert attention from the Lewinsky story. A
state-controlled Iranian radio broadcast monitored by the British
Broadcasting Company suggested that the military move was ``aimed
at covering up and overshadowing his problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservative commentator Arianna Huffington said she would not
be surprised if Harry Thomason, the Hollywood producer who has
helped the Clintons with scandal damage control and appeared before
the grand jury himself last week, had a hand in the orchestration
of the operation Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to pass judgment on its military necessity, but
I do say with absolute certainty that we can't have a person people
can't trust making life-and-death decisions and sending our
children to war,'' Huffington said. ``He needs to resign and leave
these decisions to someone we can trust.''

   &UR; U.S. ATTACKS TERRORIST BASES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times has moved the following stories about U.S.
missile attacks on suspected terrorist sites in Afghanistan and
Sudan. This recap expands upon the previously-filed
ATTACK-ADVISORY, with more-detailed story summaries and art
information.
</P>
<P>
   Lede story: ATTACK-U.S. (Washington) _ Dozens of U.S. cruise
missiles struck targets in Afghanistan and Sudan on Thursday in
what President Clinton described as an act of self-defense against
imminent terrorist plots and of fearsome retribution for the
bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa two weeks ago. By James
Bennet. WITH PHOTOS and GRAPHICS.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-BINLADEN (Washington) _ How Osama bin Laden, the youngest
son of a construction magnate from Yemen, became the world's most
feared sponsor of terrorism. The religious and ideological roots of
his rage lie in the 1980s, when he worked side by side with the CIA
backing the Afghan rebels. When that battle was over, he and his
fellow holy warriors went to work on the U.S. By Tim Weiner. WITH
MAP.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-CONGRESS (Washington) _ A cherished axiom of U.S.
diplomacy is that the opposition party supports the president when
missiles are flying. Thursday it worked, more or less. Most
congressional leaders, from Speaker Newt Gingrich to such reliable
Clinton critics as Sen. Jesse Helms, rallied around the
commander-in-chief. But in the surreal and cinematic atmosphere
that suffused Washington this week, a handful of voices on Capitol
Hill cried foul. By Todd S. Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-ASSESS (Undated) _ In the war against terrorism,
experience suggests that any operation, whether an assassination or
the sort of strike launched by the United States, has the quality
of damned-if-you-do-and-damned-if-you-don't. By Serge Schmemann.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-SECURITY (Washington) _ The U.S. on Thursday issued a new
worldwide warning to Americans and diplomatic personnel ``to
exercise much greater caution than usual'' following U.S. military
strikes against suspected terrorist targets in Afghanistan and
Sudan. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-MILITARY (Washington) _ The U.S. attacked targets in
Afghanistan and the Sudan with roughly 70 cruise missiles fired
from Navy ships in the Arabian and Red Seas timed to strike their
targets simultaneously, senior administration and military
officials said.The missiles struck at precisely 1:30 p.m. ET, after
dark settled over their targets, themselves more than 2,500 miles
apart, the officials said. By Steven Lee Myers. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-ALBANIA (Tirana) _ Arrests in Albania show links to the
African embassy bombings: In a series of lightning raids with the
Albanian secret police this summer, U.S. intelligence agents appear
to have thwarted a bomb plot against the U.S. Embassy here. They
also seem to have broken up a ring of Egyptian Islamic terrorists
using this nation's anarchy to set up a base. By John Kifner.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-EVIDENCE (Washington) _ President Clinton ordered strikes
on terrorist-linked facilities in Sudan and Afghanistan after
obtaining credible evidence that leading members of the
international terrorist network sponsored by Saudi exile Osama bin
Laden, who U.S. officials believe was behind the bombings of two
U.S. embassies in Africa, would be gathering Thursday at a
terrorist camp in Afghanistan to plan further attacks against the
U.S. By James Risen.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-SUDAN (Nairobi) _ U.S.-Sudanese tensions finally erupt
into open warfare. The air strike against a drug factory in Sudan
on Thursday marked the first act of open warfare in a
long-simmering cold war between the U.S. and the Islamic regime in
Khartoum. By James C. McKinley. WITH MAP.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-MEDIA (Undated) _ After a week of what felt like nonstop
talk about sex, ties and audiotape involving President Clinton and
Monica Lewinsky, television screens were overtaken Thursday by news
of a different shock value. By Lawrie Mifflin.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-MIDEAST-REACT (Jerusalem) _ Israel was quick to
congratulate the U.S. night for its missile attacks on suspected
terrorist bases, but the early reaction from many other governments
in the Middle East was a notable silence. British Prime Minister
Tony Blair was alone among European leaders in expressing strong
support. By Douglas Jehl.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-WAG (New York) _ Is life imitating art? `Wag the Dog'
springs to many minds. Beginning with a reporter's question early
Thursday afternoon to Defense Secretary Cohen about the film ``Wag
the Dog,'' we cast a wide net in search of reaction. By Frank
Bruni. WITH PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-GAS (Undted) _ VX, the chemical nerve agent that the U.S.
alleges Sudan was preparing to make, is one of the deadliest nerve
agents known, especially when applied to the skin. A 10 mg drop on
the skin can kill an adult in 15 minutes. By Judith Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-YORK (New York) _ Once they received word that the U.S.
had bombed targets in Afghanistan and the Sudan, New York City
officials immediately tightened security in a routine that Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani acknowledged has become all too familiar in recent
years. By Dan Barry.

   NEW YORK _ Once they received word Thursday that the United
States had bombed targets in Afghanistan and the Sudan, New York
City officials immediately tightened security in a routine that
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani acknowledged has become all too familiar in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing is the normal thing that we would do when
there is an international incident, which unfortunately we face
more often now than maybe we did in the past,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor and Police Commissioner Howard Safir declined to be
specific, other than to say that security had been increased at
what Safir called ``specific targets'' like public buildings,
religious institutions, embassies and consuls. As the two officials
spoke inside City Hall, police officers outside were shutting off
public access to City Hall's parking lot. ``It's because of the
bombings,'' an officer said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the mayor said the city had ``no intelligence that
suggests there would be any target here,'' city officials say that
New York is generally considered to be a primary target for
terrorists. The city endured one of the worst acts of terrorism on
American soil, the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the city had to respond to false reports of
an impending anthrax attack. It was later reported that the city
had quietly begun an effort to counter any chemical or germ
attacks. That effort included the creation of a $15 million crisis
center in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Similar precautions apparently were being taken by the Federal
Aviation Administration and the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey at airports in the area. ``We would suggest that passengers
heading for the airports tonight and tomorrow leave extra time,'' a
spokesman for the port authority said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Safir said they had called a news conference to
express their support for the Clinton administration's actions, as
well as to ease any local concerns.

CLINTON JUGGLED PERSONAL, POLICY AFFAIRS OVER WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w, a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton informed his wife of his
extramarital affair with Monica S. Lewinsky and prepared his
unprecedented testimony before a federal grand jury last weekend,
he also gathered his senior national security advisers and plotted
his strategy to do battle with terrorist forces abroad, aides said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   This combination marks a breathtaking juxtaposition of policy
and personal life. Since Monday, when the nation became transfixed
in the aftermath of his televised confession, Clinton and a few
elite aides harbored a secret: they planned to lob more than 100
cruise missiles at suspected terrorist sites in Sudan and
Afghanistan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The decisive meeting to strike came in the White House last
Friday, officials said, after Clinton's national security adviser
Samuel R.Berger and CIA Director George Tenet concluded that Saudi
millionaire Osama bin Laden was responsible for the deadly bombings
of two US embassies in Africa on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, Tenet, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen and Joint
Chiefs of Staff Chairman Hugh Shelton gathered with Clinton in the
White House to lay out their proposal for a missile attack that
would involve no troops and put no Americans at risk. The targets
were a suspected chemical weapons plant in Sudan that US officials
believe was financed by bin Laden, and his sprawling terrorist
training center in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   At the Friday meeting, Clinton approved the proposal with one
caveat: He wanted the ability to halt the operation until 6 a.m. on
the morning of the attack, when he would be secluded in a
beachhouse outside of Edgartown on Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   The operation was perhaps most notable for its secrecy.
Virtually no White House political or domestic aides were apprised
of the plans, except for Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles. Members of
the congressional intelligence committees were intentionally kept
out of the loop. Only Clinton's most senior national security
aides, as well as the four highest-ranking congressional leaders,
were kept informed, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Martha's Vineyard, Clinton worked the telephones overnight
Thursday, talking repeatedly with Berger in Washington and placing
a call to Vice President Al Gore, who was vacationing in Hawaii. At
3 a.m., Clinton gave final orders for the plan, and the 6 a.m.
deadline passed without any decision to halt.
</P>
<P>
   The operation began at 11:30 a.m., with missiles fired US ships
in the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea. Targets were struck at 1:30
p.m. The missile fire continued for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   At the press filing center in the Edgartown School, press
secretary Michael McCurry was briefing the gathered members of the
news media on Clinton's birthday celebration from the prior night
when his pager vibrated. He looked at the message, then told the
group: ``I need to do a very important piece of business. In about
10 minutes, the president will be here. He has an announcement he
has to make on a national security matter.''
</P>
<P>
   On the drive between the house and the school, Clinton
telephoned House Speaker Newt Gingrich to inform him of the
strikes. At the school, he ducked into an office and placed another
call to Senate majority leader Trent Lott. He also reached Senate
minority leader Tom Daschle.

COMPUTER GLITCH LEAVES FLIGHTS OVER N.E. UNTRACKED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For 37 agonizing minutes, air-traffic controllers
covering flights over New England and upstate New York Wednesday
night scrambled to keep planes safely separated after their
computer system failed, forcing them to exchange information with
each other on hand-written notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was chaos,'' said William Johannes, local president of the
National Air Traffic Controllers Association. ``Controllers were
having to ask airplanes where they were at, saying `Say your
position,' and one aircraft replied `Position to what?'''
</P>
<P>
   The outages at the Boston Center, located in Nashua, N.H.,
occurred at 6:50 p.m., one of the busiest times of the day. Some 75
controllers were following about 300 planes when all information
identifying the flights, including their altitude, air speed,
route, and destination, was lost.
</P>
<P>
   All that remained on the screen were the blips that inform
controllers that there is a plane in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no idea where some of the planes were,'' said Johannes.
</P>
<P>
   A backup computer system was used and, while it normally is able
to retain much of the information about each flight, it could not
do so in this instance because of the type of computer failure
involved. Jim Peters, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration, said, however, that the backup system ``worked
within its parameters.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's breakdown, one of many equipment problems to plague
the nation's air-traffic control system in general and the Boston
Center in particular, highlighted the need for upgrades of the
antiquated system, controllers say.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest incident, the mainframe computer failed, and the
backup could not reload all of the information and instead went
into a so-called ``dumb'' mode, according to FAA officials.
Controllers had to manually re-enter information into the system
and write information about each flight on strips of paper and pass
the notes along as they handed planes off from one controller to
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safety was not compromised,'' said Peters. ``Anytime we have a
failure we are concerned. But there were, as in other times,
redundancies that are built into the system and they worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Radar problems and computer outages are frequent problems for
controllers. The radar screens at the Boston Center _ which
controls more than 160,000 square miles of air space from the
Atlantic Ocean to western New York, and from the Canadian border to
south of Long Island _ have been failing with distressing
frequency, according to controllers.
</P>
<P>
   The Computer Display Channel, installed in 1972, which takes
information from IBM mainframe computers known as the HOST, has
been causing much of the trouble in the Boston Center. The channel
has been breaking down frequently, and at one point this spring,
the Globe reported, outages were occurring on almost a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that problem, the Boston Center was given a higher
priority by the FAA for a new computer display system. Preparation
work is expected to begin within two weeks, and the new system is
expected to be operating in early 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the mainframe computer, or HOST, that failed
Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   For controllers, it meant their radar screens went from having
detailed data blocks containing the airline and flight number, the
type of aircraft, the altitude, airspeed, flight path and
destination, to having blips with no identifying information.
</P>
<P>
   By punching a few buttons, controllers are able to use the
backup system if it is available. But when the backup system, known
as DARC, kicked in, it showed no information.
</P>
<P>
   Using notes, talking with controllers in New York, and asking
pilots to ``squawk and ident,'' controllers were able to
reconstruct the data that had been lost.
</P>
<P>
   When a controller asked, for example, American Airlines Flight
123 to ``squawk and ident,'' the pilot was able to manipulate a
radio transponder in the airplane that changes the radar blip on
the controller's screen from a slash to three horizontal lines.
With that identification, the controller could then type in next to
that radar blip ``AA123.''
</P>
<P>
   Delays occurred along the coast as Boston Center controllers
informed their counterparts in other centers that planes should not
enter the New England airspace. Flights waiting to take off from
Logan were delayed as well.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States attacked targets in Afghanistan
and the Sudan with roughly 75 cruise missiles fired from Navy ships
in the Arabian and Red Seas timed to strike their targets
simultaneously, senior administration and military officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The missiles struck at precisely 1:30 P.M. ET, more than 2,500
miles apart, after dark had settled in Afghanistan and as twilight
waned in the Sudan, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Most struck six separate targets within a sprawling camp near
Khost, Afghanistan, which President Clinton called ``one of the
most active terrorist bases in the world.'' A smaller barrage
struck a factory in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, that the
administration maintained produced important components for making
chemical weapons, particularly VX nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   As the attack began, Secretary of Defense William Cohen ordered
every American military base in the world to heighten its state of
alert, increasing security in the event of retaliation from
supporters of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile whom the United
States accuses of sponsoring terrorism, including the embassy
bombings in Africa this month.
</P>
<P>
   As the missile attack was launched from a distance, there were
no American casualties, the officials said. They said it was not
immediately clear how much damage the strikes caused in Afghanistan
and the Sudan, nor whether there were any casualties. Reports from
Sudanese television in Khartoum depicted injuries there.
</P>
<P>
   A senior military officer said the Pentagon was told less than
an hour after the attacks that the cruise missiles had struck the
factory in Khartoum, which the Sudanese government said was a
pharmaceutical plant. The Sudanese television images showed heavy
damage, smoke and fire at the factory, in an industrial area
northeast of the city center.
</P>
<P>
   Military and intelligence officials said the extent of the
damage in Afghanistan would not be clear until Friday at the
earliest, but that the targets there included an array of buildings
visible in satellite photographs shown at the Pentagon Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry
Shelton of the Army, declined to discuss details of the strikes, as
did Clinton's other senior national security advisers. But Cohen
said the raids would ``reduce the ability of these terrorists
organizations to train and equip their misguided followers or to
acquire weapons of mass destruction for their use in in campaigns
of terror.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, senior officials later said the United States
timed the attack when it did because of ``credible evidence'' that
there would be more than the usual number of suspected terrorists
at the camps in Afghanistan. Cohen and other officials also said
the attack was launched at night to minimize casualties among
civilians, especially in Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan was to attack these sites with sufficient power to
certainly disrupt them and hopefully destroy them,'' Cohen said.
``Some of these are solid structures; others are less so, but we
believe that given the targeting that was done with the capability
that was unleashed, it would cause sufficient damage to disrupt
them for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   The strike Thursday was the most significant military attack by
the United States since September 1996, when the Pentagon carried
out cruise-missile strikes in southern Iraq to punish President
Saddam Hussein after an attack by Iraqi troops against the Kurdish
enclave in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the first hostilities for Cohen, who joined the
administration as its only Republican Cabinet member in January
1997, and for Shelton since he took over as the nation's senior
military adviser last October. They were part of what the
president's national security adviser, Samuel Berger, called ``a
small group'' of aides that drafted the plans in extreme secrecy at
a time of considerable tumult in Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the strikes began early last week, but accelerated by
last Friday as the administration gathered what officials called
strong evidence linking bin Laden's terrorist network to the
bombings in Kenya and Tanzania and asserting that planning for
additional terrorist attacks was under way, the officials.
</P>
<P>
   American military action appears, for now, to be limited to the
strikes Thursday, but the president's senior advisers left open the
possibility of additional action, especially if bin Laden's
supporters retaliate. ``This doesn't foreclose anything,'' Cohen
said. ``What we have prepared and have to be prepared for is a long
continuing effort to deal with terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States already has a formidable array of forces in
the region, the bulk of it devoted to keeping Iraq in check. And
one military official said the Pentagon did not have to increase
its forces in the region to mount Thursday's strike.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton ordered a reduction from the peak levels
reached during last winter's showdown with Hussein over weapons
inspections, the United States still had more than 23,000 soldiers,
170 aircraft and 24 warships patrolling the Persian Gulf, led by
the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln. Seven of those ships are
fitted with Tomahawk cruise missiles, like those used in the
attacks Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The missiles, 18 feet long and costing nearly $1 million each,
can carry 1,000 pounds of explosives, fly 700 to 1,000 miles and,
with sophisticated satellite guidance, strike their targets with
remarkable precision.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Pentagon were extremely reluctant to discuss
where the cruise missiles were launched and from what ships. That,
in part, reflected diplomatic sensitivities since the United States
had to receive permission from Pakistan to send missiles over its
territory.
</P>
<P>
   However, the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that two ships steamed to the Red Sea near the Sudan while others
launched the attack from the Arabian Sea off Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the factory in Khartoum had received financial
support from bin Laden. The targets in Afghanistan were part of a
camp called Zhawar Kili al-Badr, located near Khost in the lawless
borderlands near Pakistan, which bin Laden has made his base of
operations for the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton said that a number of terrorist groups are known to have
trained recruits there. At any given time, he said, as many as 600
people stayed there.
</P>
<P>
   The complex includes a headquarters, an arms depot and several
areas devoted to training, including firing ranges. A senior
administration official described it as ``a terrorist university.''

DISNEY PULLS A POWER PLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Disney, about to make the NHL officials the
happiest guys on Earth, should find out any day now that its
preposterous decision to throw $600 million at the league so it can
retain full custody of the TV rights starting with the 1999-2000
season has been approved.
</P>
<P>
   As a bonus _ or is it a curse? _ it'll probably come
gift-wrapped with the '98-'99 season as well.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline passed a week ago for incumbent NHL rights-holder
Fox to match Disney's offer (all it has to do is agree to pay 90
percent of the offer).
</P>
<P>
   Fox might be crazy, but it isn't stupid. The network hasn't
officially passed, but consider it a pocket veto.
</P>
<P>
   The delay in the announcement is caused by Fox's attempt to hit
the dump button on the $45 million final year of its five-year,
$155 million deal. Fox has lost about $12 million on last season
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Rupert Murdoch knows all about overpaying for sports TV rights
if it means establishing a hold on something worthwhile. A few
years ago, Murdoch's troops were convinced the NHL could be the
sport of the '90s _ they even went so far as to approve a
glowing-blue puck.
</P>
<P>
   But then those pesky ratings showed _ again _ that a national
package of games, even if sold to viewers as regional broadcasts,
aren't worth more than a bunch of shaved ice. Might as well show
live coverage of the Miramar Air Show every weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's desired need to spend $350 million for the NHL as a
staple to ESPN and ESPN2 programming (in addition to a $250 million
deal for ABC) is greater than Fox's need to fill a few Saturday or
Sunday afternoons in mid-winter. Fox already has what it wants from
the NHL _ regional team coverage on the Fox Sports Net (with 19 of
the 20 teams in the U.S.). Fox will gladly give Disney the package
and laugh out loud as it pays three times what Fox feels the deal
is worth.
</P>
<P>
   And don't think Ted Turner won't have a say in all this
Murdoch-Eisner mess eventually. His Atlanta Thrashers join the
league next season. &QL; 
NOT-SO-SMALL SOLDIERS
</P>
<P>
   In the sports-media octagon, there are plenty of us who actually
enjoy getting our brains kicked in once in awhile.
</P>
<P>
   Some will even rush out to buy one of those cute little 18-inch
DSS systems because we enjoy paying hundreds of dollars a month for
sports programming.
</P>
<P>
   Expect the small dish sales to ignite even more. Because the NFL
is starting up soon? Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   Try tonight's Commando Knockout Challenge II, live from the
Crown Coliseum in Fayetteville, N.C. (Think Ultimate Fighting
Championship meets ``Officer and a Gentleman'' without Debra Winger
mucking it up.)
</P>
<P>
   Assuming you missed Commando Knockout Challenge I, a brief
debriefing:
</P>
<P>
   Two teams of 11 military men _ Team USA vs. The World Team _
slug it out in a ring shaped like (what else?) a pentagon. They can
use whatever hand-to-hand combat discipline they feel will achieve
the desired effect during the three-round battle.
</P>
<P>
   So who's the referee, some guy from Switzerland?
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team will have Navy Seals and Army Special Forces, not
George Peppard and Mr. T. The World Team has Russian KGB, British
SAS and Lebanese Special Commando Force members.
</P>
<P>
   In their last battle on Jan. 31, Team USA rallied for a 6-5
victory. How? Don't ask. We won't tell.
</P>
<P>
   So let's get this straight: The UFC can't get a license to hold
its human cockfights anywhere on U.S. soil because it's considered
too barbaric, but if you're on Uncle Sam's payroll, then it's
perfectly fine to find some back alley on Tobacco Road to settle
these non-Cold War disputes in a manly fashion?
</P>
<P>
   Again, they'll deliver an 11-fight card, and each can go the
full three 1{-minute rounds). Your mission, if you choose to accept
it, is get a dish, turn to USSB Channel 905 at 6 p.m. and pay
$14.95.
</P>
<P>
   Or don't, and go out to see ``Saving Private Ryan'' again. &QL; 
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH
</P>
<P>
   AM-1150 will carry Clippers games this season _ if there is one
_ and do so with a new radio voice. The team recently decided not
to renew the contract of analyst/play-by-play man Rory Markas...
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball's decision to take back three Sunday night
games in September from ESPN that the network had planned to farm
out to ESPN2 because of its coverage of NFL games could mean _ do
you believe in miracles! _ one extra Dodgers game shown locally.
Channel 5 has first dibs on the Sept. 6 Dodgers-Giants game from
Dodger Stadium, but with a 5:05 p.m. start, Fox Sports West 2 will
likely get it. ESPN has the scintillating Philadelphia
Eagles-Arizona Cardinals matchup that night as the opener to its
new full-season NFL Sunday night package...
</P>
<P>
   No more Tom Kirkland on Fox Sports Net. The anchor has packed up
the family and relocated to Salt Lake City, Utah, where he'll be
the sports director of NBC affiliate KSL-TV...
</P>
<P>
   Fox sends Saturday's Houston-Chicago baseball game to 48 percent
of the country _ Randy Johnson starts for the Astros, but Kerry
Wood doesn't for the Cubs, going tonight instead. L.A. is among the
29 percent who will take in another potential Dodgers humiliation
to the Braves in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   _Since Monday, Time Warner Cable in the West San Fernando Valley
has snuck in ``sneak peek'' of ESPN Classic (formerly Classic
Sports Network) on Channel 65. Just be warned the freebie runs out
at the end of the month. Meantime, all living and breathing viewers
are required to call (800) 585-PEEK to let those who monitor such
things know that they in fact saw the promotion (even if they're
not in Time Warner's coverage), fully embrace the idea and want it
added to the system ASAP, even (and especially) if it means
knocking out the Fox Family Channel.
</P>
<P>
   _WFTV, the ABC affiliate in Orlando, Fla., has moved the kids'
show called ``Young America Outdoors'' from 1 p.m. to 9 a.m. so it
can carry live the ArenaBowl XII _ HEY, THAT'S AN INDOOR FOOTBALL
GAME _ between the Orlando Predators and Tampa Bay Storm. If the
kids don't want to watch, they can go outside and play.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   _With the addition of live coverage for all four U.S. regional
finals that lead up to the most terrifying TV experience any
12-year-old kid must endure this side of having to stand next to
!racepay!Summer Sanders!off! on a Nickelodeon Channel game show,
ESPN2 has officially reached the full saturation level at the
Little League World Series tournament. The nine pre-final
tournament games on ESPN2, starting with two Sunday, are punctuated
with team coverage of a made-for-inferior-cable TV All-Star Game as
well as a hitting contest Friday, which has traditionally been the
only day of the week that the tykes get any sort of free time to
enjoy spit-wad contests and drop cherry bombs in the Williamsport,
Penn., restrooms. Whatever happened to ABC just covering the final
game as part of ``Wide World of Sports'' _ and witnessing the
robust Chinese Taipei kids drive the U.S. coach to drink in the
tiny caged dugout _ and then moving on to some cliff diving from
Acapulco?

UCLA'S McNOWN DIVES HEADFIRST INTO HYPE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cade McNown hit the beach with his UCLA teammates
Thursday. Somewhere in the Malibu surf, McNown shed his old skin
like a wet suit and braced himself for the numbing days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   For the next three months those will be man-made waves breaking
at McNown's feet, whipped into a froth by the winds of hype.
Starting with today's media gathering and Saturday's opening of
training camp, reporters will roll in and out like the tide, asking
the Bruins' senior quarterback about the Heisman Trophy that could
be his.
</P>
<P>
   The current will be unpredictable. And there's always a danger
the constant pounding will wear on McNown or that he'll get dragged
down by the powerful undertow of public opinion. The hope is that
he can hang on and enjoy the ride.
</P>
<P>
   After all, unless you're Archie Griffin, the Heisman race is a
once-in-a-lifetime experience. If you're Gino Torretta, it's the
last football high you experience. And as another former winner,
O.J. Simpson, can attest, there are far greater trials in life.
'Tis less taxing to tackle the endless question, ``Can you win the
Heisman?'' than ``Did you kill your ex-wife and her friend?''
</P>
<P>
   Before he won the award in 1968, Simpson, the former USC running
back, finished second in the balloting in 1967 behind UCLA
quarterback Gary Beban, the only Bruin to win college football's
highest individual honor. Over the past 10 years, nobody in the
Pacific-10 has come closer than USC quarterback Rodney Peete's
second-place finish in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a talent thing so much as it is a time thing. Outside
of insomniacs and sports addicts, West Coast football _ with its
glut of night games _ doesn't have a huge following east of the
Rockies. The last game the Bruins played in the Eastern time zone
was against Michigan at Ann Arbor in September of 1996. McNown,
then a sophomore, threw three interceptions in a 38-9 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, McNown has gained renown for outplaying Tennessee's
Peyton Manning in a game last year at the Rose Bowl. He finished
the 1997 season as the nation's leader in pass efficiency. So what
did he find when he flipped through a few preseason college
football publications recently?
</P>
<P>
   ``I read one article where it said I don't have a strong arm or
something,'' McNown said, ``and another that said I lack the will
to win. The most ridiculous? There was one that said I've been
really inconsistent and it used as an example the Michigan game
`debacle.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make McNown frown. His conclusion? Some would-be
Heisman voters have long and selective memories.
</P>
<P>
   To get people up to speed on McNown's skills, UCLA sports
information director Marc Dellins sent a three-minute highlight
reel from last season to a select group of writers from the East
and South regions.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the hype is pretty much in McNown's hands. Dellins
promises there will be no overkill to this Heisman campaign. Voters
won't be receiving weekly buttons or bumper stickers or coffee mugs
that say ``Vote McNow for Cade.''
</P>
<P>
   A season-opening home game Sept. 12 against Texas and Heisman
front-runner Ricky Williams should be enough to fan the flames for
these next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll come and that's fine,'' McNown said of the Heisman talk.
``I'll be very oblivious to a lot of the stuff that's being
written. As soon as you start thinking about the Heisman, you're
going to start sacrificing the team for your ego. All I'm going to
be trying to do every week is keep the team in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown's lack of pretension is so refreshing, he was voted a
team captain. That's a responsibility rarely bestowed upon a team's
resident superstar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the (stars) are really full of themselves,'' McNown
conceded. ``I find myself helping a lot of the receivers with their
routes and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown, 21, can do more than that _ and frankly, he must if the
Bruins are to live up to their No.7 preseason national ranking. By
opening himself up to the media blitz, he can deflect pressure from
the youngsters trying to take up where departed running back Skip
Hicks and receiver Jim McElroy left off.
</P>
<P>
   The way McNown, a four-year starter, ought to look at it is any
reporter pestering him is one who's not off hounding one of his
less experienced teammates. As he acknowledged during Pac-10 media
day, ``It's not like I've all-of-a-sudden been thrust into (the
limelight).''
</P>
<P>
   If it makes it any easier, McNown should turn the Heisman
question into a riddle. How many different ways can he say a lot of
nothing?
</P>
<P>
   There are enough comedic possibilities to put any of the
final-season ``Seinfeld'' episodes to shame. McNown has got his
timing down on the field, now all he's got to do is hone his
postgame delivery. What we'd give to have someone ask McNown, who
finished eighth in last year's Heisman balloting, about his
prospects and hear him say something like, ``Can I win the Heisman?
I sure hope so. I could use a 25-pound paperweight for my stack of
press clippings.''
</P>
<P>
   But first things first. McNown should go out and splurge on a
scrapbook that's thicker than any playbook. Because one day he
might look back on this as the best year of his life.

LEWINSKY TELLS JURY MORE DETAILS ABOUT SEX AND GIFTS
</HEADLINE>

jury about Currie phone call; adds more details about Lewinsky
testimony, activity outside the courthouse, new material about the
dress, statement issued by Starr from Little Rock, reaction from
White House and Reno, etc. story is now 2 takes)  (bl) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In her second and probably final appearance before
a grand jury here, Monica Lewinsky offered more specifics Thursday
about her sexual relationship with President Clinton and the gifts
he gave her as prosecutors sought to draw distinctions between her
testimony and that of the president only three days ago, lawyers
close to the case said.
</P>
<P>
   During the three-and-one-half-hour session, prosecutors bore in
on the events that led Ms. Lewinsky to return gifts from the
president that had been subpoenaed in the Paula Jones sexual
misconduct lawsuit last December, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The events surrounding the gifts are potentially the most
serious for the president because prosecutors are seeking to
determine whether he instructed Ms. Lewinsky to turn the gifts over
to his secretary, Betty Currie, rather than give them to lawyers
for Mrs. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky testified Thursday that she told Clinton last
December that the Jones subpoena demanded gifts he had given her, a
lawyer familiar with her account said. The president told her that
she could not turn over the gifts if they were not in her
possession, Ms. Lewinsky has told prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The day after her discussion with the president, Ms. Lewinsky
received a phone call from Ms. Currie, who told her, ``I hear you
have something for me,'' Ms. Lewinsky told the grand jury Thursday,
lawyers familiar with her account said. Ms. Lewinsky said that she
just assumed that Ms. Currie was referring to the gifts, the
lawyers said. Later that day, Ms. Currie went to Ms. Lewinsky's
apartment to retrieve the gifts, the lawyers said in their account
of her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But this account differs in some respects from Clinton's
testimony last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the prosecutors that he told Ms. Lewinsky in
December 1997 that she had no choice but to turn over gifts he had
given her to Mrs. Jones' lawyers, lawyers familiar with his
testimony said. When asked about the role of Ms. Currie, he said he
could not recall telling her to call Ms. Lewinsky about the gifts,
the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are also investigating whether Clinton kept some of
the gifts given to him by Ms. Lewinsky that had been subpoenaed by
lawyers in the Jones case, lawyers close to the case said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky offered more specifics of her sexual encounters
with the president than she gave in her testimony two weeks ago,
her friends and associates said. The specifics of their physical
contacts are also central to the prosecutors' case as they try to
determine whether Clinton committed perjury in a deposition in the
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, these people said, told the panel that he
intimately caressed her breasts and touched her genitals during
several encounters inside the White House. Her account was far more
detailed than the president's testimony Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Before he began Monday, Clinton admitted to the grand jury in a
statement supplied by his lawyers that he had had ``inappropriate
intimate physical contact'' with Ms. Lewinsky in the White House.
But the president repeatedly declined to discuss specific sexual
acts with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   As prosecutors continue to try to determine whether Clinton lied
in his January deposition in the Jones case, lawyers on both sides
continue to wrangle over what constitutes sexual conduct.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony Monday, Clinton argued that the type of
relationship he had with Ms. Lewinsky did not meet the definition
of sex used by Mrs. Jones' lawyers, lawyers close to the case said.
Three lawyers said he was implying that he had oral sex with Ms.
Lewinsky without testifying to that directly.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors are expected to argue that the acts described by
Ms. Lewinsky on Thursday fall within the definition of ``sexual
relations'' used by Mrs. Jones' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the testimony, prosecutors have obtained a sample of
Clinton's genetic material to determine whether it matches a semen
stain on a dress Ms. Lewinsky turned over to prosecutors, lawyers
close to the investigation said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI crime laboratory has determined that the stain on the
blue dress was semen, two officials briefed on the results said
Thursday. If the DNA in that stain matches the DNA sample from the
president, prosecutors would have forensic proof that the
president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was sexual.
</P>
<P>
   An adviser to the president said tonight that the DNA sample was
requested from Clinton last Friday and provided over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers familiar with Clinton's testimony Monday said
prosecutors asked him questions about the dress. Prosecutors
apparently considered it important to obtain forensic proof of the
relationship as well, perhaps anticipating that Clinton would
likely maintain that his contacts with Ms. Lewinsky did not fit the
definition in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   During Clinton's testimony Monday, prosecutors also asked the
president if he deliberately wore a necktie, given to him by Ms.
Lewinsky, during a Rose Garden appearance Aug. 6, the day Ms.
Lewinsky first testified before the grand jury.

 WASHINGTON: grand jury.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clinton said he did not believe the gold and royal blue tie had
been a gift from her. He was then informed she had testified she
gave it to him, and the prosecutors asked if he had worn it that
day as some kind of a ``signal'' to her, perhaps to influence her
testimony. Clinton said again he could not remember if the tie came
from her. But he insisted that he had no intention of sending Ms.
Lewinsky any kind of message that day.
</P>
<P>
   The former White House intern, stone-faced and businesslike,
said nothing to reporters this morning as she climbed out of a
Toyota Land Cruiser and walked briskly into a side entrance of the
federal courthouse in Washington, ignoring a reporter's question
about whether Clinton should apologize to her. Friends have said
Ms. Lewinsky was deeply hurt by Clinton's address to the nation
Monday, especially since he did not apologize to her in it and
because she thought he was dismissive of their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Lewinsky's appearance drew a crowd of tourists and
gawkers, it was not as intensively covered by the news media as
when she first testified before the grand jury two weeks ago. But
her testimony was crucial as prosecutors search for discrepancies
between her account and the president's.
</P>
<P>
   She emerged from the courthouse just before 2 p.m., wearing dark
sunglasses, leaving her spokeswoman, Judy Smith, to meet with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``She answered all questions truthfully and completely,'' Ms.
Smith said. ``It is our expectation that today's appearance
concludes her grand jury testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Smith added, ``is now looking forward to
beginning the process of rebuilding her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, 25, had agreed to answer questions in exchange for
immunity from prosecution. In a deal worked out with prosecutors,
she is vulnerable to prosecution only if she lies in her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, spoke out Thursday
for the first time since Clinton accused him in a nationwide
address Monday of needlessly prying into his private life.
Responding to reporters' questions in Little Rock, Ark., Starr
would not say whether he felt vindicated by the president's
admission that he misled the American public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process is one of law, gathering facts and assessing them
and making professional judgments, as it should be,'' Starr said.
``A legal process should above all be aimed at achieving and
vindicating the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the legal maneuvering, debate has intensified at the
White House over the political fallout from the Lewinsky matter.
Many of the president's political advisers have complained that the
president was not properly apologetic in his nationwide address
Monday, and that his tone prompted harsh responses from Democrats
and Republicans alike.
</P>
<P>
   Some advisers have also complained that Clinton's lawyers have
been uncooperative and that they had wrongly assured them early
this year that Clinton's defense did not rely on specific
definitions of sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   As part of an effort to unite the legal and political teams,
David Kendall, Clinton's private lawyer, met Wednesday evening with
political advisers including deputy chief of staff John Podesta,
White House officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also said that in discussions that took place
before American cruise missiles struck targets in Afghanistan and
Sudan, aides also weighed whether Clinton should agree to a major
interview or another public appearance to tamp down criticism of
his speech Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, who has had many run-ins with the
White House related to the Starr investigation, Thursday reaffirmed
her confidence in Clinton as the leader of the administration. ``In
all my dealings with the president, he has been to me a person
dedicated to the issues of government,'' she said in response to a
reporter's question.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, White House officials did their best to play down Ms.
Lewinsky's testimony. ``I don't think that the president or the
White House has been particularly following her business today,''
said White House press secretary Mike McCurry.

IS LIFE IMITATING ART? `WAG THE DOG' SPRINGS TO MANY MINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: New graphs 10 and 11 to add that reporters were watching
`Wag the Dog' when they learned that the president would make an
announcement.)  (smw) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the news that the United States had bombed
terrorist targets swept through her midtown Manhattan office
Thursday, Valerie David felt a predictable knot of emotions: sorrow
for the loss of lives, concern about the precision of the attacks,
fear about where this would all lead.
</P>
<P>
   But it was threaded with what she described as a surreal, almost
comical sense of deja vu.
</P>
<P>
   ```Wag the Dog,''' Ms. David, a copy editor for Avon Products,
explained, stifling a chuckle. ``Everybody at the office was
talking about it _ how ironic it was that life was imitating art.
We all noticed it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, the president's handlers invent a war to distract
public attention from his sexual transgressions. In real life, was
the Clinton administration doing something similar?
</P>
<P>
   Cynical in the extreme, that was a question that some residents
of the New York region could not avoid asking themselves Thursday.
And it seemed to reflect not only the bizarre parallels between
fiction and fact, but also the profound distrust that some
Americans have begun to harbor toward a president who acknowledged
misleading the public.
</P>
<P>
   These Americans may well represent a minority. A random sampling
of opinions around the New York region yielded at least as many
people who said that the president's authorization of military
force in Afghanistan and the Sudan seemed wholly justified and that
the United States could never be too aggressive in its efforts to
stamp out and deter terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of those people who professed antipathy toward
President Clinton did not think he would stoop so far as to use
military maneuvers to divert people's attention from Monica S.
Lewinsky, the woman the president admitted to having had a
relationship that was ``not appropriate.'' ``I don't think he's
that much of a dimwit,'' said Lina Fetter, an accountant from
Morris Plains, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   But there were others for whom the timing of the bombings,
coming so fast on the heels of the president's televised address to
the country on Monday night, felt a little too tidy, a little too
cinematic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that popped into my mind was how convenient
this was,'' said Brian Cooper, an investment banking analyst who
works in midtown Manhattan. ``My brother called me to tell me what
had happened, and I said, `Doesn't this remind you of `Wag the
Dog'?''
</P>
<P>
   That Cooper could not be certain whether his suspicions of the
president's motives were planted by the movie, or separate from it,
was only one of the odd ways in which Hollywood and Washington
commingled yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, the pool of news reporters assigned to a tent
outside the house where the president was staying in Martha's
Vineyard had just settled down to watch ``Wag the Dog'' on
pay-per-view television when word came that the president would be
interrupting his vacation for an important announcement. That
announcement was about the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel investigating the
Lewinsky matter, fielded a question about ``Wag the Dog'' from
reporters on the steps of a court house in Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I have seen it,'' Starr said with a chuckle. ``Other than
that, I'm not going to comment.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, mentioned the movie in his defense of
the president's actions Thursday. ``I don't think the president
would be foolish enough to do a `Wag the Dog','' he said, according
to the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Less charitable reactions could be found on the Internet, which
quickly sprouted jokes that cast President Clinton's actions as a
cunning ploy. In one, a pollster tells the president, ``Your speech
bombed. I'm being as candid as I can.'' The president then informs
an aide, ``It sounds like he said I should bomb Afghanistan.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind much of this lay the uneasy sense that in losing many
people's respect, the president and his administration had become
fair game for parody even on a day of grave international
developments.
</P>
<P>
   Roger DeWitt, an actor who was doing clerical tasks in his
agent's midtown Manhattan office Thursday, said that right after he
and the other workers in the office heard on television that the
president would be making a major announcement regarding national
security, they mentioned ``Wag the Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we all looked to see what tie he was wearing,'' DeWitt
said, riffing on news reports this week that Clinton had possibly
sent Ms. Lewinsky a message, through his choice of neckwear, on the
first day she testified to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Others spoke in more somber voices. Amanda Urban, a prominent
Manhattan literary agent, said that she immediately drew a
connection Thursday between ``Wag the Dog'' and the news reports
that she was hearing, but that she shuddered at the serious thought
she gave to the parallels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's downright scary that we have to consider the
possibility,'' Ms. Urban said. ``These are incredibly cynical
times.''

KENNEDY CENTER NAMES 6 PERFORMANCE HONOREES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (corrects spelling of `performing' in lede)  (Eds: Please use this version) 
(af) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Shirley Temple, the little girl who saved a movie
studio from failure during the Depression, and Willie Nelson, who
helped reinvent country music, were among six people named Thursday
to receive the Kennedy Center's annual honors in the performing
arts.
</P>
<P>
   The others are the actor-comedian Bill Cosby, the Broadway
song-writing team of John Kander and Fred Ebb, and Andre Previn,
the composer, conductor and pianist, whose first opera, ``A
Streetcar Named Desire,'' will have its premiere at the San
Francisco Opera on Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   They will be honored at a gala at the Kennedy Center on Dec. 6,
which will be shown on CBS later that month.
</P>
<P>
   Because the award is for lifetime achievement, the recipients
are in their 60s and 70s. But although she is 70, Shirley Temple
Black is permanently engraved in the American memory as the little
moppet whose smiling optimism helped the nation through the weary
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   That memory is caused partly by her retirement from the movies
after appearing in ``A Kiss for Corliss'' when she was 21. She
appeared in 40 movies in the 1930s, before she was 12, including
``Little Miss Marker'' in 1934, the same year that she sang ``On
the Good Ship Lollipop'' in ``Bright Eyes.'' Darryl F. Zanuck said
that her movies saved his studio, 20th Century-Fox, from
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   She is remembered as well for sparkling tap dancing scenes with
Bill ``Bojangles'' Robinson, the great black dancer, at a time when
the movies did not allow close contacts between whites and blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know about that until I was 7 years old,'' Mrs. Black
said Thursday from her California home, discussing the country's
race relations problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I got a cold, the studio would send me to Palm
Springs, where I stayed at the Desert Inn,'' she said, with Bill
Robinson joining her to teach her dance steps for their next movie.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Which cottage are you in?' I asked him,'' she said, ``and he
answered, `You don't need to know, darling.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When she pressed him, she recalled, he answered: ``I am in the
chauffeur's cottage over the garage. But don't you worry about it.
I'm there with (italics)my(end italics) chauffeur.''
</P>
<P>
   Kander, the music writing half of Kander and Ebb, is 71 and has
been the professional partner of Ebb, 63, for half his life _ since
1962, a year otherwise notable for his Broadway debut as the
composer for ``A Family Affair,'' which flopped.
</P>
<P>
   Every New Yorker hums their ``New York, New York,'' and most
people everywhere are familiar with their other hits, like
``Cabaret,'' ``How Lucky Can You Get,'' ``Maybe This Time'' and
``All That Jazz.''
</P>
<P>
   Their shows include ``Cabaret'' and ``Chicago,'' both of which
are now enjoying successful revivals; ``Kiss of the Spider Woman''
and, for those with long memories, ``Flora, the Red Menace,'' in
which the teen-aged Liza Minnelli made her Broadway debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like people to think of me as a good carpenter,'' Kander
said from his home in Manhattan Thursday. ``Being a good craftsman
means more to me than anything else. I take that very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to name other such craftsmen, he replied: ``Like
Stravinsky, like Gershwin, like Steve Sondheim, Jerome Kern, Jerry
Bock.'' It is very unglamorous, to be wonderful at your craft.''
</P>
<P>
   Cosby, who is 61, has been an influential performer for many
reasons, not the least being his role as co-star, with Robert Culp,
in the 1060s television series ``I Spy,'' in which he became the
first black actor to play the lead role in a weekly series.
</P>
<P>
   He achieved even greater success in the highly rated ``Cosby
Show'' and is known as well for his stand-up comedy, his comedy
records and his best-selling books.
</P>
<P>
   Previn, 69, has ranged from jazz to classical music, with
Hollywood film scores in between. He was born in Berlin and fled
from the Nazis with his family to the United States in 1939. He was
working as an orchestrator for M-G-M while still in high school.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In her second and probably final appearance before
a grand jury here, Monica Lewinsky offered more specifics Thursday
about her sexual relationship with President Clinton and the gifts
he gave her as prosecutors sought to draw distinctions between her
testimony and that of the president only three days ago, lawyers
close to the case said.
</P>
<P>
   During the three-and-one-half-hour session, prosecutors bore in
on the events that led Ms. Lewinsky to return gifts from the
president that had been subpoenaed in the Paula Jones sexual
misconduct lawsuit last December, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The events surrounding the gifts are potentially the most
serious for the president because prosecutors are seeking to
determine whether he instructed Ms. Lewinsky to turn the gifts over
to his secretary, Betty Currie, rather than give them to lawyers
for Mrs. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky testified Thursday that she told Clinton last
December that the Jones subpoena demanded gifts he had given her, a
lawyer familiar with her account said. The president told her that
she could not turn over the gifts if they were not in her
possession, Ms. Lewinsky has told prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The day after her discussion with the president, Ms. Lewinsky
received a phone call from Ms. Currie, who told her, ``I hear you
have something for me,'' Ms. Lewinsky told the grand jury Thursday,
lawyers familiar with her account said. Ms. Lewinsky said that she
just assumed that Ms. Currie was referring to the gifts, the
lawyers said. Later that day, Ms. Currie went to Ms. Lewinsky's
apartment to retrieve the gifts, the lawyers said in their account
of her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But this account differs in some respects from Clinton's
testimony last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the prosecutors that he told Ms. Lewinsky in
December 1997 that she had no choice but to turn over gifts he had
given her to Mrs. Jones' lawyers, lawyers familiar with his
testimony said. When asked about the role of Ms. Currie, he said he
could not recall telling her to call Ms. Lewinsky about the gifts,
the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are also investigating whether Clinton kept some of
the gifts given to him by Ms. Lewinsky that had been subpoenaed by
lawyers in the Jones case, lawyers close to the case said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky offered more specifics of her sexual encounters
with the president than she gave in her testimony two weeks ago,
her friends and associates said. The specifics of their physical
contacts are also central to the prosecutors' case as they try to
determine whether Clinton committed perjury in a deposition in the
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, these people said, told the panel that he
intimately caressed her breasts and touched her genitals during
several encounters inside the White House. Her account was far more
detailed than the president's testimony Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Before he began Monday, Clinton admitted to the grand jury in a
statement supplied by his lawyers that he had had ``inappropriate
intimate physical contact'' with Ms. Lewinsky in the White House.
But the president repeatedly declined to discuss specific sexual
acts with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   As prosecutors continue to try to determine whether Clinton lied
in his January deposition in the Jones case, lawyers on both sides
continue to wrangle over what constitutes sexual conduct.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony Monday, Clinton argued that the type of
relationship he had with Ms. Lewinsky did not meet the definition
of sex used by Mrs. Jones' lawyers, lawyers close to the case said.
Three lawyers said he was implying that he had oral sex with Ms.
Lewinsky without testifying to that directly.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors are expected to argue that the acts described by
Ms. Lewinsky on Thursday fall within the definition of ``sexual
relations'' used by Mrs. Jones' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the testimony, prosecutors have obtained a sample of
Clinton's genetic material to determine whether it matches a semen
stain on a dress Ms. Lewinsky turned over to prosecutors, lawyers
close to the investigation said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI crime laboratory has determined that the stain on the
blue dress was semen, two officials briefed on the results said
Thursday. If the DNA in that stain matches the DNA sample from the
president, prosecutors would have forensic proof that the
president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was sexual.
</P>
<P>
   An adviser to the president said tonight that the DNA sample was
requested from Clinton last Friday and provided over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers familiar with Clinton's testimony Monday said
prosecutors asked him questions about the dress. Prosecutors
apparently considered it important to obtain forensic proof of the
relationship as well, perhaps anticipating that Clinton would
likely maintain that his contacts with Ms. Lewinsky did not fit the
definition in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   During Clinton's testimony Monday, prosecutors also asked the
president if he deliberately wore a necktie, given to him by Ms.
Lewinsky, during a Rose Garden appearance Aug. 6, the day Ms.
Lewinsky first testified before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he did not believe the gold and royal blue tie had
been a gift from her. He was then informed she had testified she
gave it to him, and the prosecutors asked if he had worn it that
day as some kind of a ``signal'' to her, perhaps to influence her
testimony. Clinton said again he could not remember if the tie came
from her. But he insisted that he had no intention of sending Ms.
Lewinsky any kind of message that day.
</P>
<P>
   The former White House intern, stone-faced and businesslike,
said nothing to reporters this morning as she climbed out of a
Toyota Land Cruiser and walked briskly into a side entrance of the
federal courthouse in Washington, ignoring a reporter's question
about whether Clinton should apologize to her. Friends have said
Ms. Lewinsky was deeply hurt by Clinton's address to the nation
Monday, especially since he did not apologize to her in it and
because she thought he was dismissive of their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Lewinsky's appearance drew a crowd of tourists and
gawkers, it was not as intensively covered by the news media as
when she first testified before the grand jury two weeks ago. But
her testimony was crucial as prosecutors search for discrepancies
between her account and the president's.
</P>
<P>
   She emerged from the courthouse just before 2 p.m., wearing dark
sunglasses, leaving her spokeswoman, Judy Smith, to meet with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``She answered all questions truthfully and completely,'' Ms.
Smith said. ``It is our expectation that today's appearance
concludes her grand jury testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Smith added, ``is now looking forward to
beginning the process of rebuilding her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, 25, had agreed to answer questions in exchange for
immunity from prosecution. In a deal worked out with prosecutors,
she is vulnerable to prosecution only if she lies in her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, spoke out Thursday
for the first time since Clinton accused him in a nationwide

Responding to reporters' questions in Little Rock, Ark., Starr

<P>
   HERSHEY, Pa. _ A girlfriend once sent me a greeting card with
the message, ``I love you almost as much as chocolate itself.''
After some pondering _ and a handful of chocolate chips _ I
resolved to take it positively.
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate, after all, is life's deepest, most addictive, gooiest
pleasure: chocolate bunnies on Easter morning, miniature bars in a
Halloween bag, a chocolate malt on a sizzling summer day, hot cocoa
after skiing. Whenever, wherever that sinfully fattening brown
nectar oozes over one's taste buds, life is good. Complete. Yes,
rich.
</P>
<P>
   So imagine my consternation several months ago when I read a
news account about the world's impending chocolate shortage. In
equatorial zones across the globe, it seems that fungal and viral
diseases and icky little insects are attacking cacao trees, whose
beans are the raw material from which chocolate is made. The crunch
may hit as soon as five years.
</P>
<P>
   Uncharacteristically, I was moved by more than self-pity. I have
two sons, Roy, 10, and Guy, 8, whose happiest moments are marked by
chocolate syrup smeared on their faces. So it was with a heavy
heart that I convened a family conference around our kitchen table
to tell them they faced an empty life. Just at the point I was
venturing the suggestion that cigarettes might eventually fill the
void, my wife, Suzanne, jumped into the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   She said the world would never let chocolate disappear.
Moreover, she said chocolate is a state of mind, like Christmas.
She knew this, she said, because in her peripatetic Army brat
youth, she had once lived near the capital of chocolate, Hershey,
Pa. She said the street lights there are Hershey Kisses, the main
intersection is at Chocolate and Cocoa Avenues, and the air itself
smells of chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Yes! We sent for tourist literature, and almost before a certain
substance might melt in your mouth, we struck out. We were headed
for a destination the literature called ``the sweetest place on
earth.''
</P>
<P>
   As carless New Yorkers committed to the notion that someone else
can do the driving, we took the subway to Penn Station and the
train to Harrisburg. There, we were picked up by a van from Hershey
Lodge, where we had reservations. The service is included in a
two-day package that includes admission to Hersheypark, the
amusement park that chocolate built; the Hershey Museum, and the
Hershey Gardens. There is also a free shuttle bus to the
attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Our very first impression that night was profoundly
disappointing: the air did not smell of chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   But things picked up. Upon registering, Hershey Lodge gave each
of us a candy bar _ the classic milk chocolate slab _ with our room
key. The parking lot stop signs had Hershey Kisses on them, as did
each door. There was cocoa butter soap in the bathroom. On the
television was a channel devoted to the subject of our quest. The
first program was a history of chocolate, the next told about the
amusement park and its six roller coasters, while the third
conveyed the amazing tale of the Chocolate King, Milton Snavely
Hershey. In these magical environs, the founder's spirit rules, as
does his story.
</P>
<P>
   It Started With Caramel
</P>
<P>
   Hershey, as he is still called hereabouts a half century after
his death, landed a job in an ice cream parlor in nearby Lancaster
when he was 15, and found a home in the candy kitchen. Four years
later, he headed for Philadelphia to start a candy shop and failed.
He failed again in New York. This ability to bounce back was an
object lesson that I tried to point out to the boys.
</P>
<P>
   His creativity was another lesson, though cunning might be the
better word. Hershey returned to Pennsylvania and began to make
caramels. He did very, very well. In 1900, he sold his Lancaster
Caramel Company for $1 million but shrewdly reserved the right to
continue to sell chocolate. He had made the important observation
that children licked the chocolate off chocolate-covered caramels
and threw away the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll stake everything on chocolate,'' he pronounced.
``Caramels are a fad. The chocolate market will be a permanent
one.''
</P>
<P>
   And he matter-of-factly proceeded to learn how to make milk
chocolate, then a luxury good produced in Switzerland. In no time
at all, he had built a factory, named the town Hershey and built a
trolley system to bring milk and workers to the factory. A
byproduct was a mass-transit system that stretched for miles.
</P>
<P>
   The factory churned out tons of chocolate at prices the average
Joe could afford. Success piled upon success. Kisses began to be
made in 1907, and Hershey's soon became the world's largest buyer
of almonds, for its Almond Joy bar.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hershey was bound and determined to make the town
itself a model of benevolence for company towns. Houses were not
made in cookie-cutter molds and were priced so workers could afford
them. Hershey Park (it didn't become Hersheypark until 1971) was
established in 1907 as a picnic ground for workers. There were free
band concerts, vaudeville and before long, a carousel. Other rides
were added almost every year.
</P>
<P>
   But almost from the beginning, the park was a tourist
destination. Hershey persuaded the Philadelphia &AMP; Reading Railroad
to build a spur to bring excursions there. And in the sort of mix
of business and recreation that has become the touchstone of
today's society, the cute little town with the Hershey smokestacks
became an advertising tool.
</P>
<P>
   For years, each candy bar contained postcards of Hershey. (Candy
bars were bigger once.) Moreover, the company offered window
displays of its namesake town to store owners all over the country
as a promotional device.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the big man busily created his own legends.
When he walked through Hershey Park, he would pick up even the
tiniest piece of litter _ unless, of course, it was a Hershey candy
bar wrapper. Those, he would turn over so the label could be read.
</P>
<P>
   When he built an elegant Mediterranean-inspired hotel, he made
the dining room circular, so nobody would have a corner table. He
had noticed that people who tipped modestly ended up in such
gastronomic ghettos.

DESPITE THE STATS, PUDGE WON'T REST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ At this point in the baseball season, even
those of us who consider Pudge Rodriguez worthy of his $8 million
paycheck, are forced to register a disclaimer.
</P>
<P>
   When Rodriguez is overworked, he does become overpaid. Army
mules couldn't carry Pudge's load. And neither can Pudge. His
dedication is commendable, but not baseball profitable for either
Rodriguez or the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   No calendar is necessary at The Ballpark in Arlington. For any
Rangers' fan, the passage of spring and summer months can be
clearly marked by charting Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   April, May and June _ going so good like we knew he would. The
bat and step are lively; the arm is forever deadly.
</P>
<P>
   Early July brings the All-Star Game. They couldn't play that
thing without Pudge. He's as automatic at the ballot box as a South
American dictator.
</P>
<P>
   Then, however, here comes the season's second half, bringing
with it a slump. July doesn't lie. There are telltale signs that
the load becomes heavier.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the elephant shows up, looking for a ride. And Pudge
can't seem to get the big fellow off his back or his bat.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the steady fade of statistical numbers tells us September
is near.
</P>
<P>
   This is simply how Pudge Rodriguez's great career in Arlington
is defined. Every season it happens with the same certainty.
Managers may come and go, but the workload doesn't change, nor does
Rodriguez' steady decline.
</P>
<P>
   Pudge, for his part, resists change, even if catcher is the most
demanding position both physically and mentally. And his immense
talent as a hitter is best illustrated by this being the fourth
consecutive season his average will be better than .300.
</P>
<P>
   But what could his average and his run production be if
Rodriguez didn't hit 40 points less for his career after the
All-Star break, and if his runs batted in didn't fall dramatically
in the same span? Both declines have, of course, begun this season,
along with a defensive slide. Pudge has two RBI in his past 12
games, hasn't homered in a career-high 69 games, and since late
July is only a .260 hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up another great idea from me, although not exactly
original.
</P>
<P>
   Would somebody please rest this guy?
</P>
<P>
   And right now would not be too late to start, although Pudge
taking off one game a week behind the plate starting back in April
seemed the best plan.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Johnny Oates thinks often over the course of a season about
doing just that, but ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The next day's lineup I write down the night before and leave
it on my desk,'' said Oates. ``I'll have Pudge not playing. I'll go
home, get to thinking about it, and then the same thing usually
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates returns to the ballpark the next afternoon, tears up his
lineup card, and makes a new one with Rodriguez catching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pudge is a hard guy to leave out because of everything he can
do, and because there's Pudge's attitude to also consider,'' said
Oates. ``Ivan Rodriguez is a real unique bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my business, we've got guys you have to hit with a 2-by-4
to get them to play every day. But with Pudge, you have to use a
2-by-6 to get him out of the lineup. I love him for that, but I
also understand the wear-and-tear process he puts himself
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Regular rest is obviously not a subject Rodriguez wants to
discuss. ``If they decide to do that, I'd take the rest,'' Pudge
said, shrugging, before Thursday night's game against Cleveland.
This was his 106th start of the season behind the plate, an
American League high. Last season he led the majors in games caught
with 139.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get tired because I try to play the game hard,'' added
Rodriguez. ``What I do, however, is come to play every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates, a former catcher, believes that as long as Pudge is at
the position, his offensive numbers will slide in the second half,
even with spotted rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mental grind gets you as much as the physical grind,'' he
said. ``Who is to say his numbers would be any better? A lot of
good catchers have eventually been moved to other positions just to
give them offensive relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Oates admits ``it's a fight'' to convince Rodriguez to
take a rare off day.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, nothing will change, despite what the career
offensive numbers show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday, however, picture Pudge as a third baseman,'' added
Oates. ``The quick hands and feet, the arm ... think about that and
think about what he'd hit without the burden of catching.''
</P>
<P>
   Only then apparently could Rodriguez's July and August follow
his April-May-and-June pattern.

 HERSHEY, Pa.: gastronomic ghettos.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hershey's mansion was not remote; it was across the street from
the chocolate factory. At the suggestion of his wife, Kitty, the
childless couple devoted almost all their personal fortune to
caring for orphans on farms surrounding Hershey, an initiative that
the family's foundation continues, although today's beneficiaries
are not necessarily parentless.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast and Dessert
</P>
<P>
   The infomercials ended. It was bedtime, particularly as the only
feasible alternative was clearly the Cartoon Network. It was then
we experienced our second disappointment: no York Peppermint Patty
on the pillow. I had sort of expected it.
</P>
<P>
   Upon waking up, we were thus especially eager to get to
breakfast in the lodge's Lebbie Lebkicher's Eatery and Pub, named
for a man who lent Hershey some money after one of his failures. It
is decorated with old posters for nickel-and-dime candy bars. The
waitress asked the boys whether they wanted chocolate milk or hot
chocolate. She gave them crayons in a tin candy container.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to eat more chocolate than you've ever eaten in
your life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   I had coffee and four succulent chocolate muffins, but the
children ate healthily. To be sure, the waitress had point-blank
refused Guy's request to give them plates of whipped cream. A
Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, with a human inside, came by. Guy said,
``It's fun shaking your favorite candy's hand, right, Dad?''
</P>
<P>
   After grabbing a handful of free Hershey Kisses for the road, we
waited in front of Hershey Lodge for Suzanne's flute teacher, who
lives nearby and with whom she has kept up all these years. The
hotel is oriented to families and conventions, and had seemed more
our kind of place than the hilltop Hotel Hershey across town. This
was not just because it is cheaper, but because it also had
miniature golf, several swimming pools and a video arcade.
</P>
<P>
   A friendly crowd. There were lots of people in Nascar and
motorcycle T-shirts; a huge woman wearing an ``I'm a chocoholic''
tank top; a couple with triplet babies in a single stroller, and
people carrying five-foot-high stuffed animals they had obviously
won at the amusement park. Pointing to the prizes, Roy gasped,
``Those kids are talented, Mom.'' (He believed this deeply, it was
to emerge in tearful moments later on.)
</P>
<P>
   Youthful Memories
</P>
<P>
   But before visiting Hersheypark, we went for a ride with
Suzanne's teacher, Bish, and her husband, Karl. Suzanne's four
years in a nearby town, Cleona, seven miles down the road from
Hershey, was the longest she lived anywhere as a child. We saw her
high school and other required sights We also went to places to
sample fresh-made soft pretzels and Lebanon bologna.
</P>
<P>
   Most compellingly, we marveled at the chocolate factory, with
the giant logo Hershey Cocoa spelled out in shrubbery, as well as
the towering silos full of cocoa beans. We saw Hershey Hotel, with
the magnificent fountains and stone lions in the lobby, and the
stunning gardens outside. Reverently, we paused at the intersection
of Chocolate and Cocoa and whiffed the air wafting over from the
factory. Yes, Virginia, it smelled divinely of chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   What was once the centerpiece of a Hershey visit, a factory
tour, has not been offered for years. Suzanne remembered seeing
huge vats of bubbling chocolate and savoring a chocolate milk on
factory tours of her youth. By the early 1970s, the tour was
drawing a million people a year, ultimately making it too crowded
for the workers.
</P>
<P>
   The solution was Hershey's Chocolate World, a Disney-like tour
of chocolate, with visitors riding automated cars. The attraction
has just been spruced up in honor of its 25th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   For the brief ride, about 10 or 12 minutes, one sees the world
from the perspective of a cocoa bean. From being cut with a machete
in an unidentified rain forest, you are shipped in containers to
the Pennsylvania promised land for roasting, milling, refining and
any number of other things. A Donald Duck-sounding voice provides
commentary. The cars never stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``So cool, man,'' Roy intoned as we went through the roaster
oven where the enveloping odor was you-know-what. The Hershey's
Kiss machine would have been anti-climactic, had it not been so
fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   The final message, from an eminently sincere recorded voice,
was: ``No matter where you go, no matter how far, you're always
near a Hershey's Bar.'' As if to prove it, you are then given a
free candy bar before exiting into a really big gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, you pass an expansive wall plaque with a lot of
names on little gold sheets. It is labeled the Hall of Fame of the
National Confectionary Salesmen's Association. That seemed
intriguing. Who were these men prowling the highways and byways of
America to bring chocolate to those in need? I'll never know,
because Roy and Guy had made a beeline for the gift shop. We raced
to keep up.

 HERSHEY, Pa.: keep up.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best part of the shop was the giant made-to-order candy bars
they were selling that you could put any message on: ``Thanks for
watching the house,'' was the suggested one. I briefly thought of
provocative inscriptions I might have written to that long-ago
girlfriend, when my attention was suddenly seized by a toddler
stumbling by in a daze. ``Chocolaty, chocolaty,'' he kept
repeating.
</P>
<P>
   The Early Factory Days
</P>
<P>
   We each had a hot fudge sundae at an ice cream stand near the
gift shop. Then it was a short walk on to Hershey Museum, mostly an
eclectic collection of things Hershey picked up here and there _ an
American Indian section, Pennsylvania Dutch furniture, artifacts of
Victorian America and lots on the history of the Hershey family,
town and business. The Hershey stuff was best.
</P>
<P>
   Roy loved the re-creation of the factory locker room, where he
put on the chocolate-brown uniform of a worker and punched a time
clock. In the Discovery Room, the boys time-traveled to the 1800s
and pretended to buy things at a general store and cook on a wood
stove. What they liked best was playing checkers, a game that has
not changed. Parents sit on chairs at the edge of the room as
spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Intriguingly, a small exhibition hinted that things were not
always simple and easy, even in the world's sweetest town. In 1937,
there was a pretty brutal sitdown strike, the result of workers'
discontent with wages and an organizing campaign by the Council of
Industrial Organizations. The strikers shut down the plant and
barricaded themselves inside. Workers loyal to Hershey, local dairy
farmers and the American Legion fought with the strikers.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, neither the Council nor a company union got
bargaining rights. Hershey promised not to discriminate against any
participants. Chocolate town returned to cozy comfort.
</P>
<P>
   One wondered, though. One object in the display case, with no
accompanying explanation, riveted my attention: a wooden club with
a leather strap. And according to another exhibition at the museum,
life on the world's sweetest assembly line was relentlessly
demanding piecework. Payment on the ``Kiss line'' was a dime for 20
dozen Kisses.
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate Shake-ups
</P>
<P>
   The time for Hersheypark had come. Suzanne and I have kind of an
ambivalent feeling about amusement parks. It might be because
neither of us much likes spinning out of control at high altitudes.
Or it might be an aversion to seeing the rubes, particularly
ourselves, fleeced on the Midway. What we like about amusement
parks is the atmosphere, somehow nostalgic and challenging at the
same time. We like Coney Island. Sometimes we think we should take
the boys to Disneyworld, but we've never quite gotten around to it.
</P>
<P>
   Upon entering, we were measured to determine which rides we
could handle. Roy was tall enough to be a ``Twizzler,'' a Hershey's
candy that, alarmingly, contains no chocolate. That meant he could
ride almost anything. Guy was a Hershey Bar, which barred him from
a ride or two. Suzanne was ``Cookies `N' Creme.'' At 6 feet 3
inches, I was waved through.
</P>
<P>
   We began bravely enough by marching straight to the Comet, the
biggest roller coaster in the United States when it opened in 1946.
We waited in line for about 45 minutes, which is standard for most
of the big rides on the weekend. I rode with Roy. We screamed and
complained and promised to ride each of the park's other five
coasters, then somehow forgot to get around to it.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne and Guy found the experience sinister. She made Guy
close his eyes throughout the ride. She feared she was going to fly
out of the car, and sank so deeply into her seat her knees and back
hurt. She said it was awful. Guy let it be known that his teddy
bear (and alter ego), who had just been named Teddy Fudge in honor
of our expedition, would ride no more roller coasters. That meant
Guy wouldn't either.
</P>
<P>
   We soon found ourselves absorbed in the fantasy world of the
park. We drank big lemonades, lots of them, and ate popcorn and
cotton candy and funnel cake. Roy and I did a really great water
slide, Pistol Pete's Plunge, and also Tidal Force, a ride in which
you slowly climb a 100-foot hill in a 20-passenger boat, then shoot
down at a 43-degree angle to hit the water with an enormous splash.
The boys and I loved yet a third water ride, Canyon River Rapids,
which gives the experience of white-water rafting. But on a hot
afternoon, we had to wait for more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne and Guy tackled the Rodeo, an innocuous enough looking
ride compared with all the killer coasters _ particularly the new
Great Bear, on which riders sit in ski chairs with their feet
dangling down through 60-mile-an-hour corkscrew turns and
360-degree loops. But she was white as a sheet after revolving and
rotating, at the same time, on the Rodeo. Roy studied the map and
said, ``I've got a good ride for Mom _ the bathroom or the
telephone booth.''
</P>
<P>
   So it went, through two sunny days and one neon-seared night.
Fear, laughter and time moving at a little different speed. A
spectacular antique carousel went round and round and round. The
boys cried bitterly after unsuccessful tries at tossing balls in
milk cans and other Midway games, but were thrilled to win stuffed
animals when a barker could not guess either of their weights.
</P>
<P>
   They frolicked in the misting sprinklers the park has placed at
strategic locations. They laughed a little too loudly when a
toddler threw up his Twizzlers. At ZooAmerica, which began with
Hershey's personal animal collection and is included with admission
to the park, we walked on a bridge to a quieter, wooded world. The
animals are exclusively North American. We liked the bears.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, what to think? The experience is wholly commercial,
with every feature linked to promoting the Hershey image, or
occasionally other corporate sponsors who have rented space. What
is known as ``the sweetest parade on earth'' consists of 14
characters, each a trademarked Hershey's product, marching
triumphantly through the park shortly before dark. Having your
picture taken with one or another candy bar is one of everyone's
favorite activities.
</P>
<P>
   Well, why not? For better or worse, Hershey in this very place
made chocolate accessible to the masses. By definition, chocolate
is happiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we ate too much chocolate,'' Guy mumbled as we were
leaving, a Hershey's Kiss firmly in his mouth. ``But this  &UR; is &LR;  a
special chocolate place.''

MANY FACES OF SINATRA: FROM FLUFF TO `ETERNITY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (Critic's Notebook) 
(smw) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the more unlikely romantic couplings to be
found in a 1950s Hollywood movie was the pairing of Frank Sinatra
as a gaunt, impoverished young composer from New York City and
Doris Day as his indefatigably chipper apple-cheeked Connecticut
dream girl. Ms. Day's character, who is engaged to another man
throughout much of the film, is the singer with a family orchestra
whose perky togetherness and taste for kitsch vaguely suggest a
tacky Connecticut equivalent of the Von Trapps.
</P>
<P>
   The Sinatra character, an Italian-American who has changed his
name to disguise his origin, moans on and on about how the fates
have conspired against him in both his career and his love life.
When he sings ``One for My Baby'' near the end of the film, the
song becomes a summation of all the self-pitying complaints that
have gone before. Throughout the movie, Ms. Day's goody-goody, who
finds herself strangely drawn to him, is tireless (to the point of
obnoxiousness) in her efforts to cheer up this self-proclaimed
loser who, unbeknownst to her, has been nursing a case of
unrequited love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young at Heart,'' which will be shown Sept. 4 to Sept. 6 at
Walter Reade Theater as part of the Film Society of Lincoln
Center's ``Salute to Sinatra,'' is a musically enhanced remake of
``Four Daughters,'' the 1938 movie in which John Garfield made his
screen debut. In the remake Sinatra fills Garfield's shoes, playing
the same vulnerable ``ethnic'' outsider pressing his nose to the
glass and peering with longing at a preposterously idealized vision
of WASP gentility.
</P>
<P>
   The 1954 movie, whose title was taken from the hit song that
commercially revitalized Sinatra's recording career after a long
slide, is miles away from the best film he made. But what it
captures, perhaps more purely than any of his other movies, is the
essence of his screen charisma and the mannerisms that embellished
it.
</P>
<P>
   There is the raised left eyebrow arched to the point of no
return, expressing a deep quizzical sadness that in later films
shaded into a combative cynicism. There is the tilted fedora that
seemed to float on the side of his head like a more grown-up,
rakish version of the askew sailor hat he sported in 40's movie
musicals. There is the cigarette dangling so precariously from one
side of his upper lip that you begin to wonder if the butt hasn't
been glued on.
</P>
<P>
   Finally there are the eyes that seem to spin like blue
pinwheels, alternately searchingly lonely and penetratingly
observant. As Sinatra aged, that aura of loneliness and wonder
steadily gave way to a harder glare seething with a tough, often
accusatory carnal knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that ``A Salute to Frank Sinatra'' forcefully
demonstrates is that Sinatra didn't have to sing to be a movie
star. Singing may have gotten him into the movies. But after his
1953 comeback in ``From Here to Eternity,'' he wouldn't have had to
sing another note to continue on screen as long as he cared. As the
series also shows, after ``From Here to Eternity,'' the period in
which Sinatra cared didn't last too long.
</P>
<P>
   At his most convincing, he embodied and carried forward his own
version of Garfield's up-from-the-streets outsider tradition,
mixing it with some of Humphrey Bogart's
hard-as-nails-but-still-vulnerable tough guy. To these archetypes
he brought an extra dimension of waifish vulnerability. More than
any other male movie star, with the possible exception of
Montgomery Clift, Sinatra wore his nerve endings on his sleeve. But
where Clift's characters seemed terminally neurotic, Sinatra's were
scrappy outsiders fighting their way in.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra's physique had a lot to do with it. In an era of fleshy
male stars, he was skinny, and as a bobby-socks idol had been
ridiculed for it. Thinness, of course, has always been equated with
hypersensitivity (think of the expression thin-skinned), and
Sinatra's tender imploring ballad style of those early years was
nothing if not sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   With Maggio, the Academy Award-winning role in ``From Here to
Eternity'' that turned his career around (and for which he was paid
a measly $8,000), all the chemical ingredients of Sinatra's screen
and vocal persona came together. The wiry, high-strung outsider
whose self-martyring refusal to buckle to authority costs him his
life is a version of the same personality who could prostrate
himself totally to a self-destructive passion in a song like ``I'm
a Fool to Want You.'' But that scrappy outsider could also swing
out with a feisty aggression that on a good night could best an
opponent twice his size.
</P>
<P>
   But could Sinatra really act? It depends on what you mean by
acting. Even in his most ``serious'' performances, you are never
less than 100 percent aware that what you're watching is Sinatra
giving a performance. And when the shoe fits, that performance can
be impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his finest moment after his triumph as Maggio came in
``The Man With the Golden Arm,'' Otto Preminger's black-and-white
1955 adaptation of Nelson Algren's novel, in which Sinatra plays a
heroin-addicted cardsharp and aspiring drummer fighting to survive
on Chicago's mean streets. The scenes in which his character goes
cold turkey with the help of Kim Novak (as a sympathetic bar girl)
are still harrowing to watch. As his character goes through the
shakes and cold chills, his nerve endings aren't just on his
sleeve, they're emitting stinging lightning flashes from all over
his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Salute to Sinatra,'' which begins Friday and runs through
Sept. 8, features 19 of the 57 films he made. All phases of his
career are represented, from the 40's musicals to the '50s dramas
(excluding ``Suddenly,'' the well-regarded film in which he played
a presidential assassin) to his Rat Pack capers (only one,
``Ocean's 11'') and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Sinatra maintained a certain stubborn integrity.
If his taste in songs began to waver in the 1960's, his taste in
movie roles more than wavered; it plummeted. But even if Sinatra
walked through a role or riffed crudely on a pop song (``How's your
bird, Mrs. Robinson?'' he once interpolated), he was always nothing
more or less than himself.

   TREASURY BOND YIELDS FALL AS INVESTORS FLEE STOCKS
</P>
<P>
   Turmoil in overseas economies sent investors fleeing stocks for
the safety of bonds, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond
to 5.51 percent, another new low. The Dow Jones industrial average
fell 81.87 points, to 8,611.41.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that Russian bank failures were imminent and that
Venezuela might be forced to devalue its currency, the bolivar, to
combat a growing budget deficit, and persistent concerns about a
similar move by China, buoyed the Treasury market. All of these
things added to investor concerns that the financial crises among
emerging markets may be spreading.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan stocks plunged 9.5 percent, the biggest one-day drop
in nearly four years, as the market was rattled by worries that the
government might devalue its currency. Other Latin American markets
also declined. Mexico's chief market index fell 2.93 percent. In
Brazil, the Sao Paulo stock exchange's Bovespa index fell 6.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   BARNES &AMP; NOBLE UNIT TO GO PUBLIC
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Barnes &AMP; Noble rose 7.5 percent, or $2.8125, to
$40.0625, after the bookseller said it planned to sell 20 percent
of its on-line venture to the public. Barnes &AMP; Noble also announced
that its loss for the second quarter tripled, primarily because of
a $23 million loss by the on-line venture.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT TRIAL IS DELAYED 2 WEEKS
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge has pushed back the starting date of the
antitrust trial against Microsoft until Sept. 26. Lawyers for the
company and Justice Department were also bickering over where and
how pretrial questioning of Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft,
would take place.
</P>
<P>
   FED GROUP VOTED 10 TO 1 ON RATES
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve policy makers voted 10-1 at their meeting on
July 1 to leave the overnight bank lending rate unchanged at 5.50
percent. The lone dissenting vote was from Jerry Jordan, president
of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   HONG KONG BOUGHT STOCKS AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong government bought stocks for the fourth time in a
week and intervened in the futures market for a third session as it
continued to try to hurt currency and stock speculators.
</P>
<P>
   FOREIGN SALES BOLSTER HONDA PROFIT
</P>
<P>
   Honda Motor reported a 26 percent profit gain in the latest
quarter, largely because of sales in Europe and the United States.
Those overseas sales once earned Honda criticism, but now many
Japanese business executives are praising the benefits of
globalization. Hiroyuki Yoshino, the new president of the auto
maker, predicted that the overseas expansion would protect Honda
from the consolidation sweeping the automobile business.
</P>
<P>
   NOVELL BEATS EARNINGS ESTIMATES
</P>
<P>
   Third-quarter profit at Novell beat analysts' expectations by
one cent as the maker of networking software cut costs and improved
sales by selling new Internet-based products. Net income was $26.6
million, or 7 cents a diluted share. The company had been expected
to earn 6 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   AUTODESK BUYING DISCREET LOGIC
</P>
<P>
   Autodesk, a maker of software for engineers and designers, plans
to buy Discreet Logic, a maker of special effects for movies and
television, for about $520 million in stock.

   IRS SET TO PERMIT USE OF PLASTIC
</P>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service will accept payments of Federal tax
bills by credit card next year.
</P>
<P>
   STRAINED RELATIONS IN ADVERTISING
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between ad agencies and advertisers is
deteriorating, according to the 1998 Salz Survey of
Advertiser-Agency Relations. The surveys for 1996 and 1997 had
brought surprisingly better responses from executives at agencies
and client companies when asked about the nature of their
relations. But that era of good feelings proved brief.

   NEW YORK _ Yes, they thought that the embassy bombings in East
Africa constituted a crime of the lowest order. And yes, they
thought that Osama bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi who has publicly
threatened a holy war against the United States, came across as a
shady character with an inordinate amount of power.
</P>
<P>
   But in the New York metropolitan region Thursday, immigrants
from the Sudan and Afghanistan reacted to bombings by the United
States on their respective homelands with surprise, horror and
skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   Like many others, the immigrants wondered about the timing of
the strikes, suggesting that President Clinton was aiming not so
much to punish bin Laden as to divert attention from the Monica
Lewinsky case. But they also criticized what they said was a
foolhardy strategy of going after one man accused of terrorism by
picking on two countries that have been mired in misery for so
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the floods and the earthquakes and the wars and threats
of attacks from Iran,'' said Maryam Miazad, an Afghan immigrant
living in Westbury, N.Y., ``this was the last thing Afghanistan
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the two immigrant groups, the Afghans are by far the more
numerous and visible in the New York region. According to official
figures, there are more than 5,000 Afghans in New York City;
community leaders, though, say that there could be as many as
40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Most Afghan-Americans moved to the United States after the
Soviet invasion in the late 1970s and early '80s. It was a tragic
time, said Yusuf Mohammed, an Afghan immigrant who lives in New
York City. He added that the invasion was the latest example of
Afghanistan's suffering at the hands of rapacious invaders, first
Alexander the Great, then the Chinese, then the British.
</P>
<P>
   Now, said some of the immigrants, come the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is a superpower,'' said Mohammed, an employee at the
Afghan Kebab House near Times Square. ``The Afghan people don't
have food to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Historical indignities aside, many Afghan-Americans said they
were irritated, even dumbfounded, at Washington's strategy for
capturing, or killing, bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't bombard one area, maybe kill hundreds of people,
just for one person,'' said Mohammed Yusufi, imam of the Afghan
Immigrants Islamic Center in Flushing, Queens. ``Everyone was
surprised by this. Everyone was shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Several people questioned Clinton's motives for the strikes.
Some Republican senators, including former presidential candidate
Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, hinted that Clinton's troubled
personal life was the rationale behind the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what everyone else thinks,'' Ms. Miazad said. ``Monica
Lewinsky testified today, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Even those who were willing to give the United States the
prerogative to vigorously defend its citizens said they were
disappointed with the military action. They said the Taliban, the
fundamentalist Muslims in control of the Kabul government, have
yearned for world-stage recognition from other nations,
particularly the United States. So it followed, the
Afghan-Americans said, that the United States might have had some
leverage in giving the Taliban recognition, money and food in
exchange for bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   ``America had a good chance to talk to these guys,'' said Bashir
Saleh, who operates a coffee cart in Times Square. ``America could
have used diplomacy. But now, America strikes in Afghanistan, and
the Taliban are going to say, `We're going to defend this guy till
our last drop of blood.' ''

WOMAN, 20, PLEADS GUILTY IN DEATH OF SON SHE DELIVERED AT '97
PROM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del.)  (js) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREEHOLD, N.J. _ In a barely audible, childlike monotone that
gave little hint of remorse, the 20-year-old woman who delivered
her child during her high school prom last year and then placed his
body in a trash can pleaded guilty Thursday to aggravated
manslaughter in the child's death.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Melissa Drexler of Forked River, N.J., entered her
plea in Superior Court in Monmouth County as part of an agreement
that had been in place for more than a month. Her original court
date of July 9 had been postponed by Judge John Ricciardi.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Ricciardi first questioned Ms. Drexler extensively
to determine whether she understood the import of her decision to
plead guilty. Then he formally accepted the plea and set sentencing
for Oct. 29. Ms. Drexler has been free on bail, and will remain so
until the sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Drexler stood next to her lawyer, Steven Secare, as she read
a statement written in blocky, upright cursive handwriting.
Spectators had to strain to hear her describe what she did as an
18-year-old on June 6, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   She said that she had kept her pregnancy a secret from friends
and family. Her water broke in the car while she was on her way to
the prom at a ballroom of the Garden Manor catering hall in
Aberdeen Township.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the bathroom and delivered the baby,'' she said.
``The baby was born alive. I knowingly took the baby out of the
toilet and wrapped a series of garbage bags around the baby.''
</P>
<P>
   In matter-of-fact language apparently intended to show the
``knowing indifference'' that is required for a charge of
aggravated manslaughter, she continued:
</P>
<P>
   ``I was aware of what I was doing when I placed the baby in the
bag. I was further aware that what I did would most certainly
result in the death of the baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Monmouth County prosecutor John Kaye said that although his
investigation turned up strong evidence against Ms. Drexler, he had
chosen the plea agreement to avoid a trial. Among the reasons, he
said inconclusive autopsy evidence of whether the baby was dead or
alive at the time of delivery was likely to be bitterly contested
by prosecution and defense experts.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye added that had there been a trial, Ms. Drexler's lawyers
had a good chance of winning acquittal on the grounds of ``extreme
emotional disturbance.''
</P>
<P>
   Aggravated manslaughter carries a 10- to 30-year sentence, but
in line with the terms of the plea agreement, Kaye said that he
would seek a sentence of 15 years. Under New Jersey law, Ms.
Drexler would normally have to serve at least five years of that
term before becoming eligible for parole, Kaye said. But he said
with time off for good behavior, she could serve as little as 35
months in prison.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Should Ms. Drexler serve 35 months, her imprisonment would last
slightly longer than the expected stays of the two figures in
another widely publicized infanticide case involving New Jersey
teen-agers. Last month, Amy Grossberg and Brian Peterson, two
20-year-olds from Wyckoff, N.J., pleaded guilty in a Delaware court
to manslaughter in the death of their infant, whom they threw in a
trash bin after he was born on Nov. 12, 1996, in a Newark, Del.,
motel room. Peterson, the first one to strike a deal to cooperate
with the prosecution, received a 24-month sentence, while Ms.
Grossberg received a 30-month sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this fits with other sentences in similar cases even
though she doesn't show remorse,'' Kaye said of the Drexler case.
He said that in his 15 years as county prosecutor there had been 12
other cases of killings of newborns. All but one resulted in plea
agreements and similar sentences, he said. The one exception went
to trial in 1987 and the defendant, Patricia Giles, was found
guilty and sentenced to the maximum of 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye and the senior prosecuting attorney, Elaine Leschot,
speculated that a continuing emotional remoteness from what had
happened could account for Ms. Drexler's emotionless tone of voice
at the hearing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the findings of prosecution and defense psychiatric
examinations, Kaye described Ms. Drexler as someone who, upon
becoming pregnant by her boyfriend, John Lewis of Barnegat
Township, apparently isolated herself from her own emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye, speaking after the court session ended, gave more details
about the case than Ms. Drexler had revealed in her court
statement. He said that his investigation had determined that Ms.
Drexler had arrived at the prom between 7:30 and 7:45 p.m., gone
immediately to the women's room, entered a stall and locked it
while a friend remained outside.
</P>
<P>
   He said there were no eyewitnesses to what happened in the
stall, only someone who heard sounds and saw a large quantity of
blood.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye said that Ms. Drexler delivered the baby, whom he described
as ``born perfect,'' into the toilet. She retrieved him and
apparently cut the umbilical cord with the serrated edge of a paper
towel dispenser that hung on the wall in the restroom stall.
</P>
<P>
   Tests of the baby's lungs for signs that it may have drowned
were ``inconclusive,'' Ms. Leschot said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about the likely sentence, Kaye did note that if the
baby's death had taken place three days later, Ms. Drexler would
have been subject to a new state law requiring that those convicted
serve at least 80 percent of their sentence before becoming
eligible for parole.

IN SHIFT, PATAKI PROPOSES MAJOR EXPANSION IN HOUSING FOR RETARDED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two months after 26 retarded adults were found to be
living in homeless shelters at the Westchester County Airport, Gov.
George Pataki has proposed a major expansion of a housing program
for developmentally disabled people, one that is intended to place
thousands of them in group homes around New York State.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's proposal calls for spending $230 million over the next
five years to create housing for 4,900 people and represents a
significant departure for the governor, who during his first three
years in office added fewer than 900 beds for developmentally
disabled people. Currently, the state houses 32,000 mentally
retarded people in group homes and supervised apartments; about
6,500 are on waiting lists for housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the right way to do the right thing for people who
need our help here in New York State,'' Pataki said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But critics charged that Pataki was embarrassed into making the
election-year proposal after it was disclosed in June that retarded
adults in Westchester were living among a homeless population that
included drug and alcohol abusers and ex-convicts. Advocates for
the homeless said that their subsequent inquiries led them to
estimate that about 8,000 developmentally disabled people were
living in homeless shelters statewide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became an enormous political problem for the governor,''
said Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, D-Greenburgh. ``At the same time,
it was apparent that on a human basis, he had to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas Maul, commissioner of the state Office of Mental
Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, denied that the plan
had anything to do with the Westchester situation. He said the
proposal was meant to address a chronic housing shortage that has
its roots in a 1975 federal court order that forced the state to
close institutions for mentally retarded people because of
deplorable living conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This proposal and what happened in Westchester are two
separate issues,'' said Deborah Sturm Rausch, a spokeswoman for
Maul. ``Anyone can go to a shelter if they need help. The question
is what happens after they get there. Do they remain or do the
providers refer them elsewhere? What we're doing here is responding
to a need.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Westchester County shelter, officials said
that many of the retarded adults wound up there after living with
aging parents who could no longer care for them.
</P>
<P>
   While advocates for the mentally retarded are thrilled with
Pataki's announcement, the plan could lead to a backlash in
neighborhoods where the group homes would be situated. Though 6,600
group homes have opened in New York state since the 1975 court
decree, some homes were put into service only after vociferous
debates.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Families of people with mental disabilities welcomed the plan,
although some expressed skepticism about its timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thrilled when I heard about the governor's announcement,
but then I realized he is running for office,'' said Rochelle
Kessler, a 61-year-old widow living in Greenburgh, who cares for
her 33-year-old developmentally disabled son, Stuart. ``I'm not
going to be around forever and I've got to get him used to a group
home before I'm gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Details of the plan are still being worked out, said Ms. Rausch
of the office of mental retardation, though it had been decided
that the beds would be operated by private, nonprofit agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky questioned the timing of the proposal, saying Pataki had
come under fire for recent decisions involving the developmentally
disabled. In particular, Pataki was criticized during the last
legislative session for vetoing a proposal that would have added
175 beds to the system.
</P>
<P>
   But Maul's spokeswoman said Pataki vetoed the item because it
would have served only as a Band-Aid on a worsening problem and he
wanted to come up with a long-range plan.

EDITORIAL: STRIKING AGAINST TERRORISM 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, August 21:
</P>
<P>
   The United States has every right to attack suspected terrorists
if there is credible evidence showing that they were involved in
attacks against U.S. citizens or were planning such attacks. That
seems to be the case in the missile attacks ordered by President
Clinton in the Sudan and Afghanistan, an impression strengthened by
quick support from House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Sen. Orrin Hatch
and other leading Republicans. But since those attacks were ordered
from a White House weakened by scandal, Clinton needs to take extra
care to reassure the country that the attacks were not timed to
help repair his shaken presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officials reported Thursday that they had collected
convincing information from numerous sources that the terrorist
organization of Osama bin Laden was responsible for the deadly
truck bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania earlier
this month. Bin Laden is a Saudi multi-millionaire reportedly
turned terrorist who has openly threatened to attack Americans
anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's selection of targets looks reasonable. One of the
sites was described by Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the joint
chiefs of staff, as a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan
operated by bin Laden. He said the other target was a factory in
Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, that was used to make chemicals for
nerve gas. Intelligence officials said bin Laden had subsidized
Sudan's chemical weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   Though the U.S. raids came only three days after Clinton
addressed the nation and testified to a grand jury about the Monica
Lewinsky case, Pentagon officials said the timing had been dictated
by the threat that the bin Laden network might strike Americans
again within days. If so, that would also justify the quick U.S.
action.
</P>
<P>
   Retaliating against terrorists may invite further terrorism, but
effective military strikes can at least temporarily hinder training
and planning by terrorist groups. Certainly, U.S. inaction in the
face of hard evidence of terrorist activities would be
irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   But combating terrorism should not be an excuse for cloaking
U.S. military actions in secrecy, as Pentagon officials tried to do
Thursday. To sustain public support for anti-terrorist actions, the
administration needs to tell Americans as much as possible about
how the raids were conducted and whether there were civilian
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his national security team seemed at pains Thursday
to demonstrate that he had not unleashed U.S. power to deflect
attention from the Lewinsky case. Clinton pointedly noted that he
had ordered the attack on the unanimous recommendation of his
aides. Samuel Berger, the national security adviser, reported that
military planning began on Aug. 12, and Clinton authorized
preparations for the attack last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Those accounts were reassuring. Still, the picture of Clinton
striding purposefully back into the White House Thursday as
commander in chief could not help but supplant the image of an
emotionally wounded first family departing for Martha's Vineyard on
Tuesday. Clinton can dispel any lingering doubts about his
motivation by providing the House and Senate intelligence
committees with a complete briefing on the bin Laden information
and instructing his aides to fill out the partial accounts they
have given about the raids.

RIVER PARKS OFFER MANHATTANITES A BACK YARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kate Young lives in the East Village but likes to
walk over to the meticulously kept lawn outside Battery Park City
to read. Marilyn Smith makes weekly visits to the esplanade from
her Greenwich Village home. And Daryl Richardson of Chelsea says he
likes the chain of parks along the Hudson in lower Manhattan better
than Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   For park-starved lower Manhattanites, the rapidly expanding
stretch of parkland from Battery Park to Chambers Street is
becoming what Central Park is for uptown residents: the closest
thing they have to a back yard. And as a hybrid of public-private
parkland, the series of parks is a model of what the future may
hold for the Hudson River shoreline as developers team up with the
city to turn neglected land into recreational space.
</P>
<P>
   The thousands of visitors who have been descending on the parks
are drawn by a wealth of attractions: magnificent Hudson River and
harbor views framed by finely landscaped lawns, whimsical
sculptures, a variety of restaurants and a regular schedule of free
events like concerts and storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is spectacular,'' said Ms. Smith, a retired
secretary. ``I feel like I'm in San Diego.''
</P>
<P>
   But as crowds have flocked to the parkland in lower Manhattan
over the last few summers, there has been grumbling that what was
once a downtown oasis is becoming overrun by those people, many of
whom live outside the immediate area and don't pay directly to
support the parks. On a recent Sunday, scores of Roller-bladers
whirled crazily about, weaving around bicyclists and baby
carriages. At one playground, security guards sometimes make
children and their parents line up to be admitted only when someone
else leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten to the point where a lot of people, myself
included, are afraid to take their children into the playground,''
said Paul Goldstein, district manager of Community Board 1, who
lives nearby. ``You almost have to take a number to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   The parks' popularity, no doubt, is a symptom of success _ a
success backers say is rooted in having the private sector actively
involved in running parks as government support becomes scarcer.
The chain of parks along the lower Manhattan shoreline saw its
genesis in 1985, when the Battery Park City Authority opened the
esplanade as the first new waterfront park in the city since the
opening of the Brooklyn Heights promenade in 1954. The idea was to
give beauty and texture to the new residential community nearby,
while enhancing real estate values.
</P>
<P>
   Since the esplanade was constructed, other areas have been
turned into parkland, from the heavily used Rockefeller Park in the
north, to the picturesque South Cove and the intricately landscaped
Robert F. Wagner Park in the south. And all the parks are marked by
a painstaking attention to detail, in both their planning and
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   But perfection comes at a price. The $4 per square foot in
annual maintenance costs is more than 10 times the amount that New
York City spends on an average square foot of parkland. Those
expenditures are shielded from the traditional uncertainties of
spending on parks: because the city ceded management but not
ownership of Battery Park City's open spaces to the authority, the
river park is completely protected from any cuts in city spending.
</P>
<P>
   The quasi-private nature of the parks has left some nearby
residents with a proprietary feeling, signaling that an effort to
reduce city government's role in parks management could have its
pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Elli Fordyce, a jazz singer who has lived in Battery Park City
for 11 years, says the crowds that jam the park on weekends
sometimes make it feel like Coney Island or Jones Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of rowdiness, necking and drinking and stuff,''
she said. ``It's just as not as pleasant when it's crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   Tessa Huxley, the executive director of the Battery Park City
Parks Corp., the subsidiary of the Battery Park City Authority that
runs the 30 acres of parkland connected to the housing complex,
said that in the early years of the development, residents tended
to react more like those in gated communities. ``People felt
shocked and angered to see strangers here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she says, the cocoon mentality has largely receded, though
the principal support of the park is still assessments paid by
owners and renters that average $270 a year per unit. She said
residents have become used to crowds streaming to the parks, as
well as to the new Museum of Jewish Heritage and the World
Financial Center's Winter Garden, with its stately indoor palm
trees.
</P>
<P>
   Others who live in the complex say they they do not mind sharing
their back yard with visitors, who help support the many
restaurants and shops in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice if it were all ours, but that's not
realistic,'' said an executive recruiter who lives in Battery Park
City and was out teaching her 4-year-old daughter to ride a bike.
``That sort of resentment is just unjustified.''

DESPITE THE STATS, PUDGE WON'T REST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ At this point in the baseball season, even
those of us who consider Pudge Rodriguez worthy of his $8 million
paycheck, are forced to register a disclaimer.
</P>
<P>
   When Rodriguez is overworked, he does become overpaid. Army
mules couldn't carry Pudge's load. And neither can Pudge. His
dedication is commendable, but not baseball profitable for either
Rodriguez or the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   No calendar is necessary at The Ballpark in Arlington. For any
Rangers' fan, the passage of spring and summer months can be
clearly marked by charting Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   April, May and June _ going so good like we knew he would. The
bat and step are lively; the arm is forever deadly.
</P>
<P>
   Early July brings the All-Star Game. They couldn't play that
thing without Pudge. He's as automatic at the ballot box as a South
American dictator.
</P>
<P>
   Then, however, here comes the season's second half, bringing
with it a slump. July doesn't lie. There are telltale signs that
the load becomes heavier.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the elephant shows up, looking for a ride. And Pudge
can't seem to get the big fellow off his back or his bat.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the steady fade of statistical numbers tells us September
is near.
</P>
<P>
   This is simply how Pudge Rodriguez's great career in Arlington
is defined. Every season it happens with the same certainty.
Managers may come and go, but the workload doesn't change, nor does
Rodriguez' steady decline.
</P>
<P>
   Pudge, for his part, resists change, even if catcher is the most
demanding position both physically and mentally. And his immense
talent as a hitter is best illustrated by this being the fourth
consecutive season his average will be better than .300.
</P>
<P>
   But what could his average and his run production be if
Rodriguez didn't hit 40 points less for his career after the
All-Star break, and if his runs batted in didn't fall dramatically
in the same span? Both declines have, of course, begun this season,
along with a defensive slide. Pudge has two RBI in his past 12
games, hasn't homered in a career-high 69 games, and since late
July is only a .260 hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up another great idea from me, although not exactly
original.
</P>
<P>
   Would somebody please rest this guy?
</P>
<P>
   And right now would not be too late to start, although Pudge
taking off one game a week behind the plate starting back in April
seemed the best plan.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Johnny Oates thinks often over the course of a season about
doing just that, but ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The next day's lineup I write down the night before and leave
it on my desk,'' said Oates. ``I'll have Pudge not playing. I'll go
home, get to thinking about it, and then the same thing usually
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates returns to the ballpark the next afternoon, tears up his
lineup card, and makes a new one with Rodriguez catching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pudge is a hard guy to leave out because of everything he can
do, and because there's Pudge's attitude to also consider,'' said
Oates. ``Ivan Rodriguez is a real unique bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my business, we've got guys you have to hit with a 2-by-4
to get them to play every day. But with Pudge, you have to use a
2-by-6 to get him out of the lineup. I love him for that, but I
also understand the wear-and-tear process he puts himself
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Regular rest is obviously not a subject Rodriguez wants to
discuss. ``If they decide to do that, I'd take the rest,'' Pudge
said, shrugging, before Thursday night's game against Cleveland.
This was his 106th start of the season behind the plate, an
American League high. Last season he led the majors in games caught
with 139.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get tired because I try to play the game hard,'' added
Rodriguez. ``What I do, however, is come to play every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates, a former catcher, believes that as long as Pudge is at
the position, his offensive numbers will slide in the second half,
even with spotted rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mental grind gets you as much as the physical grind,'' he
said. ``Who is to say his numbers would be any better? A lot of
good catchers have eventually been moved to other positions just to
give them offensive relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Oates admits ``it's a fight'' to convince Rodriguez to
take a rare off day.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, nothing will change, despite what the career
offensive numbers show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday, however, picture Pudge as a third baseman,'' added
Oates. ``The quick hands and feet, the arm ... think about that and
think about what he'd hit without the burden of catching.''
</P>
<P>
   Only then apparently could Rodriguez's July and August follow
his April-May-and-June pattern.

RECORD IS GORDON'S IF HE AVOIDS ROUGH STUFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL SCHLOTTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Will he or won't he?
</P>
<P>
   With Jeff Gordon in position to set NASCAR history Saturday with
a fifth consecutive Winston Cup victory at the Goody's 500, it's
time to examine the facts, pore over the data and make a
prediction.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the clues are contradictory.
</P>
<P>
   Those who think Gordon has a great shot at becoming the only
modern era (post 1971) driver to win five straight point to his
record.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has he won his past four races this season, he has also
won the past four Food City 500 races, the annual spring event at
the Bristol Motor Speedway, site of Saturday's race.
</P>
<P>
   And having cut his teeth on short tracks in the Midwest, Gordon
knows well that the key to winning on the half-mile Bristol course
is contained in an old racing axiom: To finish first, first you
have to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary concern at Bristol is finishing the race and
keeping all four fenders on,'' Gordon said. ``If we're in position
at the end, then we'll think about going for the win.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who think (hope?) Gordon won't get No.5 Saturday also have
supportive data.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has never won the Goody's race at Bristol, which is held
at night in the heat of summer. And they point to last year's race
as an example of what could happen.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon had led 184 of the 244 laps and was running near first
when a collision with Jeremy Mayfield on the short, tight-cornered
crowded track knocked him out of the lead. And by lap 365 his car
was done and he had to settle for a 35th-place finish that enabled
Mark Martin to overcome him in the season points race.
</P>
<P>
   Short-track racing is notorious for bump-and-shove racing. Look
for Gordon's competitors to scratch up his paint job a bit as they
try to bring his team back to earth.
</P>
<P>
   Can he survive the rough stuff and win?
</P>
<P>
   I think he will.
</P>
<P>
   Holy cow stat of the week: Gordon has made 91 pit stops this
season. In all but eight of them, his pit crew has gotten him back
on the track in the same position or better compared to other cars
pitting at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   See ya: Wood Brothers racing is looking for a driver to replace
Michael Waltrip, who announced Monday that this season will be his
last in the No.21 Winston Cup Citgo Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip, who finished 14th in 1996, 18th last year and is 15th
so far this season, said both parties agreed a change was needed
after a recent spate of poor finishes. Waltrip has finished out of
the top 20 in seven of the past nine races.
</P>
<P>
   The younger brother of Darrell Waltrip, Michael Waltrip has
never won a Winston Cup event in 383 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Another parting: Scott Pruett, one point out of fifth place on
the CART tour this year, will end a five-year relationship with
Patrick Racing and join Arciero-Wells next season.
</P>
<P>
   In a 10-year CART career, Pruett has developed a reputation for
consistency if not domination. He has been a top-10 finisher in
season points five times and has two series victories.
</P>
<P>
   Robbie Gordon will not be back with Arciero-Wells, despite a
longstanding friendship with co-owner Frank Arciero. Gordon is
seeking other options.
</P>
<P>
   Movin' on up: Winston Cup driver John Andretti _ nephew of Mario
and cousin of Michael _ has five top-10 finishes in his past six
races and has moved from 21st to 11th in season points.
</P>
<P>
   Speedy Boat: &UR; !off! &LR;  Indy Racing League driver Billy Boat was
slowed by crutches anytime he left his car at the Radisson 200 in
Colorado last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the wheel, he was plenty fast, winning the pole and
setting a track record of 178.571 mph in qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   In his first race back since fracturing his femur at the IRL
race in New Hampshire on June 28, Boat had to settle for a
ninth-place finish when his car ran out of fuel with two laps to
go.
</P>
<P>
   Women's road-racing tour formed: An eight-race road-racing tour
featuring women drivers is being planned for 1999 by the American
Le Mans Series.
</P>
<P>
   The series will be called the Women's Global GT Championships
and is being headed by longtime open-wheel driver Lyn St. James.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a platform to highlight women as drivers,'' St. James
said. ``... My objective is to provide a venue for them to get
their names out as good candidates for careers in racing.''
</P>
<P>
   St. James said the series would be a stepping-stone to GT-3 or
GT-2 racing. Drivers will race identically prepared Panoz GT-RA
cars. The organization is looking at both Sears Point and Laguna
Seca as possible race sites.
</P>
<P>
   Shafer off and running: North Hollywood's Jeff Shafer finished
fourth at the Texaco Havoline 200 KOOL Atlantic race last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of what Jeff did, coming in fourth in just his
third race,'' said team co-owner Cal Wells III. ``He got the rookie
of the race award. I look forward to having him race again for us
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Shafer, who has been running a limited schedule for the team,
started eighth behind teammate and pole- and race-winner Anthony
Lazzaro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one of the fastest cars on the track,'' Shafer said.
``... It was the best run I've had and I just hope to keep taking
it forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Next on Shafer's calendar will be a KOOL Toyota appearance in
Vancouver, British Columbia, Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Woodside slips: Valencia's Sean Woodside finished eighth in
Saturday's Coors Light 200 at Monroe, Wash., and lost a few more
points to season points leader Kevin Harvick, who finished third,
in the NASCAR Winston West season points race.
</P>
<P>
   Woodside now trails Harvick, of Palmdale, by 34 points.
</P>
<P>
   Nuts and bolts: CART season points leader Alex Zanardi has put
off any announcement of his 1999 plans for two weeks. Zanardi, who
may leave CART to return to Formula One racing and his native
Italy, said he expects to make his decision by Sept. 1.... When
Jimmy Hensley came from his 30th starting place to win last week's
Federated Auto Parts 250 in Nashville, it was Hensley's first win
on the NASCAR truck series and the first time a provisional
qualifier won a series race.... Michael Schumacher's victory in
last week's Hungarian Grand Prix was the 32nd of his career, moving
him past Nigel Mansell into third place on the all-time victory
list.... Formula One racing is negotiating a return to South Africa
in 2001.... When he coasted to victory in Sunday's Radisson 200 at
Pikes Peak International Raceway Sunday _ his car out of gas _
Kenny Brack became the second driver in the Indy Racing League's
short history to win back-to-back events.... Ted Musgrave, recently
bumped from the No.16 Primestar Ford in favor of Kevin Lepage, will
drive Jimmy Spencer's No. 23 Winston No Bull Ford on Saturday and
perhaps for the rest of the season. Spencer is recovering from a
concussion suffered at Watkins Glen. Steve Grissom will drive
Spencer's Busch Grand National ride tonight.... Winston Cup driver
Joe Nemechek _ 24th in season points _ signed a three-year contract
extension with Team SABCO to drive the No. 42 BellSouth Chevy Monte
Carlo.... Palmdale's Ron Hornaday Jr. continues to lead the NASCAR
Craftsman Truck points race. Hornaday, the 1996 champion and
all-time series win leader has a 70-point advantage over Jack
Sprague.... Lance Hooper, also of Palmdale, was 30th in Saturday's
Busch Grand National Pepsi 200.... Craftsman Truck driver Bryan
Reffner _ 12th in the season points _ and his crew chief, Les Back,
were fired by Phelon Motorsports Tuesday.... John Myers, a
three-time NHRA pro stock bike motorcycle champion, was killed in a
motorcycle accident near his home in Birmingham, Ala., on Aug. 9.
He was 40.... Al Bignotti, a mechanic for A.J. Foyt, Graham Hill,
Al Unser Sr. and Gordon Johncock, died Aug. 11 at the age of 89.

   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. strikes in Afghanistan and the Sudan
Thursday came after U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies
had gathered what officials described as the strongest evidence
ever obtained in a major terrorist case.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. intelligence community has been convinced for years
that Osama bin Laden has been involved in a long series of attacks
against American interests. But the officials said they had more
comprehensive and conclusive evidence than ever before linking bin
Laden to the bombings at the American Embassies in Africa earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said that evidence provided the justification
he needed to order the attacks. But Clinton and his aides provided
no real details of the evidence, and in some major aspects, the
credibility of the administration's case against bin Laden was
difficult to assess, both for the African bombings specifically and
for terrorist activities in general.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton accused bin Laden of an array of actual
and plotted terrorist acts, from attacks on U.S. soldiers in
Somalia to plots against the pope and American passenger planes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most detailed bit of evidence to back the U.S.
accusations was not even spelled out by the president.
</P>
<P>
   In Albania, the authorities, aided by U.S. intelligence agents,
arrested five men who were described as Egyptian Islamic terrorists
and seized material indicating that they intended to bomb the U.S.
Embassy in Tirana, Albanian officials said. U.S. officials said
that plot was one of several attacks planned by bin Laden's
network. It was not clear whether that plot was to have been
carried out before or after the bombings in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity
said credible evidence showed that a number of leading members of
what they called an international terrorist network sponsored by
bin Laden would be gathering Thursday at a terrorist camp in
Afghanistan to plan further attacks on the United States.
</P>
<P>
   By attacking the meeting site, the United States hoped to badly
damage the terrorist network, officials said. They said they would
not be able to assess the damage done at the terrorist camp until
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The government's counter-terrorism center, based at the CIA,
``feels strongly that there is as much and as rich evidence from a
wide variety of sources on this case as they have ever had,'' said
a senior U.S. official. ``Our information was convincing, and we
had a high confidence level that these bombings were planned and
carried out by bin Laden's network. And we had compelling evidence
that bin Laden and his organization were planning further attacks.
If we didn't take action, we were going to get hit, there's no
doubt in our mind.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials declined to provide any details of the evidence
linking bin Laden to the embassy bombings, but they have said they
strongly suspected his involvement since the day of the attacks. As
their investigation gained momentum, they said, the links to bin
Laden quickly began to emerge. In contrast to other recent major
terrorist cases, which have required months or years to solve, the
evidence against bin Laden in the East Africa bombings came
together with remarkable speed.
</P>
<P>
   Officials would not comment Thursday on earlier reports from
Pakistan that Mohammad Saddiq Odeh, a suspect arrested in Pakistan
and sent back to Kenya for interrogation by the FBI, had told
Pakistani investigators that the bombings were the work of bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had early indications, and over time the information got
better,'' a senior U.S.intelligence official said. ``We had
multiple sources, and the picture was extremely convincing. You
have to be careful how you weigh early information, but in this
case it was very compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rarely do numerous sources converge so uniformly and
persuasively as they did in the course of our investigation into
the responsibility for these terrorist acts,'' added the
president's national security adviser, Samuel Berger.
</P>
<P>
   The Zhawar Kili guerrilla camp, near Khost, Afghanistan, where
the terrorist conference was expected to be held, was hit by
American sea-launched cruise-missiles. American officials said that
bin Laden had held a similar conference in Afghanistan in January,
apparently to plan attacks against the United States. Bin Laden's
networks have issued new terrorist threats against the United
States since the embassy bombings, and so American officials
believe that the Thursday meeting was to plan future attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had information that something in the camp was going to
take place today,'' said a senior U.S. official. ``It's possible
the meeting was to plan further attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials say the camps have been in existence since
the 1980s and Thursday they showed satellite photos of a vast
complex that they said included the camps. They added that the bin
Laden network uses the camps for training.
</P>
<P>
   One American official said that since May, bin Laden has become
increasingly cautious about his personal security. Earlier, he had
stayed largely in one place outside Kandahar, Afghanistan, but
since May he has been moving frequently, perhaps out of a fear that
his campaign would make him more of a target, an American official
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the attack on the camp in Afghanistan, the United
States struck at what the Sudanese call a pharmaceutical plant in
Khartoum, capital of the Sudan, which U.S. officials said was
making a precursor element used in the production of VX, a potent
nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   A senior American official said that bin Laden has been working
with the Sudanese government since 1995 or 1996 to try to develop a
chemical weapons capability. The plant in Khartoum, struck by
American cruise missiles Thursday, was operated by the Sudanese
military-industrial complex, which has been financially supported
by bin Laden.

MISSISSIPPI: SECOND THOUGHTS ON PRIVACY RIGHTS  
 ARIZONA: A TEST OF WILLS OVER DRUG LEGISLATION  
 WYOMING: SURPRISE SHOWDOWN LOOMING 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A couple of years back, Gov. Kirk Fordice of Mississippi was
seriously injured in a car wreck while traveling from Memphis to
Jackson. He recovered but questions about the crash and
circumstances leading up to it dogged him and were making headlines
and talk shows long after he returned to work.
</P>
<P>
   Area papers reported that at the time of the crash, the
governor, a Republican, was not accompanied by his usual state
police escort. They said that a few hours before the crash he was
seen sipping wine in a Memphis-area restaurant with a woman who was
not his wife. Mrs. Fordice, they noted, was out of the country,
representing the governor and the state on a cultural mission.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to shed some light on all this, Fordice said, repeatedly,
that there was nothing to say because he could remember nothing
about the accident and, anyway, he was entitled to his privacy.
</P>
<P>
   That said, on Tuesday the governor had something to say about
the Clinton-Lewinsky matter and the president's confessional of the
night before. Addressing a gathering of Mississippi Republicans in
Jackson, he called for Clinton's resignation, declaring it would be
``the best thing for the country, without question.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We now know he's a liar,'' Fordice said. ``Other horrors and
much worse are to follow and impeachment will surely follow and the
United States doesn't need that.''
</P>
<P>
   Character counts in politics, the governor went on, adding:
``When folks enter public office, they're due all the scrutiny they
get.''
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: A TEST OF WILLS OVER DRUG LEGISLATION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was called Proposition 200 and it seemed straightforward
enough when it appeared on Arizona ballots in the fall of 1996.
Backed by a well-financed grass-roots organization that called
itself Arizonans for Drug Policy Reform, it proposed allowing
doctors to prescribe marijuana and other illegal drugs for medical
use by grievously ill and dying patients.
</P>
<P>
   Voters approved it.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Legislature, one of the most conservative in the
country and in no mood to have the Grand Canyon State join other
states like California and Washington in the much-debated national
push to legalize illegal drugs for medical use, saw the proposition
as a legislative end run by a special interest group that had
considerably more in mind than just compassion for the sick.
Legislative leaders said that although marijuana was the drug most
talked about for medical use by Proposition 200's proponents, the
measure, if allowed to stand as written, also would permit doctors
to prescribe other illegal drugs like heroin, LSD and PCP.
</P>
<P>
   The legislature amended the measure, as Arizona law permits,
adding a rider that said Arizona doctors could not, under any
circumstances, prescribe a drug not on the federal government's
list of approved drugs. That amendment effectively gutted the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   But the fight did not end there.
</P>
<P>
   Arizonans for Drug Policy Reform, having renamed itself The
People Have Spoken, now has another drug proposal for Arizona
voters to consider. Labeled Proposition 300 and scheduled to be on
this fall's ballot, it would restore Proposition 200 to its
original form and instruct the legislature not to modify it again.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting back, state lawmakers are making sure that this time
around, the official ballot description of the proposition is
worded so that voters will understand that they are deciding not
only whether to legalize the use of marijuana for medical purposes
but also the use of many other illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, The People Have Spoken, whose main supporters
include George Soros, the international investor involved in
several social issues, asked a judge to throw out the lawmakers'
description of the measure, arguing that it was unfair for the
legislature to be in a fight in which it alone wrote the rules of
engagement. The court refused and the pamphlets are being readied
for distribution.
</P>
<P>
   WYOMING: SURPRISE SHOWDOWN LOOMING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming is one of the nation's most Republican states, with the
Grand Old Party enjoying a 2-to-1 registration edge over Democrats.
So the odds are that the state's Republican governor, Jim Geringer,
will handily win a second term this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the aftermath of Tuesday's primaries in the Cowboy
State, the race now merits watching.
</P>
<P>
   Geringer safely won renomination, but in doing so, some
weaknesses were exposed. As a result the Democratic nominee, state
Sen. John Vinich, who also readily won nomination, probably has a
better shot at the governor's job than he originally had reason to
expect.
</P>
<P>
   Since he took office three years ago, the governor has struggled
to get the Wyoming economy moving, but with little success. With
its small population, limited job base and vast remoteness, the
state is the rare economic exception in this era of boom, and
throughout the primary season the governor's critics were quick to
put the blame on him.
</P>
<P>
   His main challenger in the primary, Bill Taliaferro, a sheep
rancher, hammered him relentlessly on the matter. But the governor
also had to contend with the issue and its political fallout when
one of the state's highest-ranking Republicans, Secretary of State
Diana Ohman, announced that she too was unhappy with his leadership
and approved a last-minute write-in campaign for the nomination on
her behalf.
</P>
<P>
   She did not cut very deeply into the governor's support. But her
campaign underscored the divisions within the Republican Party
under his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all for the governor, when the primary was over,
Taliaferro, who pulled 29,000 votes, or about a third of the entire
Republican vote, announced that he would not automatically throw
his support to the governor in the fall but instead might consider
supporting the Democratic nominee, Senator Vinich.
</P>
<P>
   Taliaferro said he would try to make his supporters ``players''
in the contest by urging them to go with the candidate who offered
them the most. Then he called on the governor to institute
wide-ranging economic reforms to solidify the Republican vote and
avoid any defections.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 29,000 votes out there,'' he went on. ``Who wants
them? Vinich or Geringer?''

MILDRED B. SMITH, 99, SPECIALIST IN AGRICULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Fla., Mass.)  (js) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elizabeth Mildred Buller Smith, an independent-minded woman who
cut a singular swath through the 20th century, among other things
picking apples and digging potatoes for the Women's Land Army in
World War I, riding herd on New England milk prices for the Office
of Price Administration in World War II and becoming a Connecticut
television celebrity as a consumer price specialist, died on Aug.
12 at a nursing home in Hartford. She was 99, and it seems almost
beside the point to note that she had been an agricultural
economist for the University of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   To say that Miss Smith followed her own path would hardly do
justice to someone who became a farm specialist after growing up on
the streets of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But Miss Smith, who spent several girlhood summers on a farm,
was ever an original, one whose career included driving a hotel
jitney in Florida, starting and running the country store for Henry
and Clara Ford's Wayside Inn in Sudbury, Mass., and creating and
starring in ``Millie's Market Basket'' on Connecticut television.
</P>
<P>
   Never one to be hampered by convention, Miss Smith went to work
for the agriculture department of the Connecticut Agricultural
College before she received a bachelor's degree from the University
of Chicago; became an assistant professor at the University of
Connecticut (as the agricultural college became in 1938) before she
received a master's degree from Radcliffe College; and never did
bother to get a doctorate, although she did complete postgraduate
studies at the London School of Economics.
</P>
<P>
   For someone born in the Victorian era, Miss Smith adapted well
to 20th-century culture, much to the occasional dismay of her
mother, a staid woman who had derived her Victorian outlook in
situ, growing up in England, and who was properly shocked when her
daughter, who had not come of age in the Roaring Twenties for
nothing, would go off for weekends with her young man of the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   (Miss Smith, whose romantic life became a subject of intense
speculation among her grandnieces and grandnephews, apparently
found a satisfying solution to the problem of juggling job and
family: attracting a steady supply of smitten suitors without
actually succumbing to matrimony. She derived enormous delight a
few years ago when she received a proposal from an admirer at her
Hartford retirement community on the very day the Social Security
Administration notified her that she had died _ as, it turned out,
another Mildred Smith had done.)
</P>
<P>
   Miss Smith's sense of personal mission began early. With three
of her four older brothers serving in the military in World War I,
she was so eager to do her part that, ignoring her mother's
objections, she dropped out of the University of Chicago to enlist
in the Women's Land Army, a paramilitary organization that sought
to fill the vacuum left by mobilized farm workers.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Miss Smith, who had a lifelong fascination with
statistics, not only picked apples and dug potatoes on a farm in
East Corinth, Vt., but counted them, computing yields and other
data for reports that she later deposited with the Schlesinger
Library at Radcliffe.
</P>
<P>
   After the fall harvest one year, the farmer whose land she had
worked tried to find her a winter job at a resort that his friend
Henry Ford owned in Eustis, Fla., but wondered whether Miss Smith
knew how to drive, a requirement for the job of shuttling guests to
and from the train station.
</P>
<P>
   In a reply that later delighted her grandnieces and
grandnephews, Miss Smith reassured him: `'I've been driving
tractors since I was 12.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Miss Smith did so well as a jitney driver that she
apparently impressed Ford and his wife, Clara. In 1923, when they
bought the inn made famous by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, they
recruited Miss Smith to start and run the country store that became
a part of the historic restoration and preservation project.
</P>
<P>
   By 1931, Miss Smith had found her life's work in academia, but
after a decade as a statistician and consumer price specialist at
the University of Connecticut, she decided that it was time to
complete her own college education. So, again flouting convention,
she returned to Chicago and received her degree at age 42.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after becoming an assistant professor in 1943 and
spending three years with the OPA's Boston office, she received a
master's degree from Radcliffe.
</P>
<P>
   She remained an assistant professor, but her work as a teacher
and consumer marketing specialist _ among other things turning out
pamphlets and conducting radio and television programs stressing
thrift _ was so impressive that when she retired in 1961, she was
named professor emeritus.
</P>
<P>
   In retirement Miss Smith wrote historical pamphlets on New
England agriculture and taught herself bookbinding, selling
leather-bound notebooks and other items at craft fairs to finance
her yen for travel, which included 18 trips to England and the
Continent, where as a young woman, it should come as no surprise,
she had climbed the Matterhorn.

HACKETT SORTS OUT OFFENSIVE LINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE _ USC coach Paul Hackett set his starting lineup for the
Pigskin Classic on Thursday, with a couple surprises along the
offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Junior-college transfer Matt Welch will start at right tackle,
despite the fact Hackett had nearly exclusively mentioned veterans
Ken Bowen and Rome Douglas as the challengers for the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen, last year's starter, has a hyperextended elbow and was
expected to have a magnetic resonance imaging test Thursday. But
Hackett said Welch was named the starter before Bowen even got
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Welch) won the job for one game,'' Hackett said. ``It can
change at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch (6-foot-6, 295 pounds), of Santa Ana Junior College,
orally committed to UCLA last year before changing his mind in
January and signing with USC.
</P>
<P>
   The center position also underwent a change, as Eric Denmon beat
out Matt McShane. Junior Jason Grain has won the left guard spot,
with Donta Kendrick behind him. Sophomore Brent McCaffrey will
start at left tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the offensive line will continue to see a lot of
movement,'' Hackett said. ``The big thing is finally there's a
settling of the offensive line but I hate to say it's rock solid.''
</P>
<P>
   The new lineup means junior Travis Claridge is the only
returning starter from last season who will start the season opener
against Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're inexperienced and we're limited,'' Hackett said. ``And
the game is won and lost in the trenches.''
</P>
<P>
   At fullback, Brennan Ochs will start but split time with Ted
Iacenda. Mike Van Raaphorst will start at quarterback, and as
expected, freshman Carson Palmer will be No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Morton will start at tailback and Malaefou MacKenzie will
back him up, but freshman Frank Strong is going to be in the
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   At cornerback, Ken Haslip will start but share time with Antuan
Simmons. Lawrence Larry of Littlerock has won a defensive end
position.
</P>
<P>
   Woods update: Hackett still has not heard from quarterback
Quincy Woods, who left camp Monday, but a close friend said, ``He's
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, upset that he had no chance to start or back up at
quarterback, left camp Monday night to ponder his future and is now
expected to transfer.
</P>
<P>
   He had already considered a transfer to a Division I-AA school
last year and would probably go that route if he seeks his release
from USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talk to Quincy, I'll talk to you,'' Hackett said.
``I've not talked to Quincy and I have nothing to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Cusano questionable: Hackett is hoping linebacker Mark Cusano
(hamstring) will play in the Pigskin Classic, but said sophomore
Zeke Moreno will start at linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure how much Mark will play in the opener,'' Hackett
said. `I hope a lot. I'm disappointed in Mark's injury. After
seeing him today, he might be able to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Marvin Powell's chances of being ready for the opener
are also in doubt as he recovers from a twisted knee.

CALIFORNIA ACTS TO BAR GAGS IN DEFECT CASES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ANDREA ADELSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ California motorists who obtain restitution from
automakers for defective vehicles may no longer have to promise
they will stay quiet as part of their settlements.
</P>
<P>
   California lawmakers passed a bill this week that would bar
automakers from imposing gag rules in agreements to repurchase cars
or trucks that are deemed defective under the state's lemon law.
The bill, the first of its kind in the nation, awaits the signature
of Gov. Pete Wilson; an aide said Wilson was likely to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Vows of silence over the settlement terms of a court case, or
details of a matter resolved privately, are common in disputes
involving medical malpractice, product liability and corporate
malfeasance. Increasingly, consumer advocates say, these secrecy
clauses are being written into automakers' agreements to buy back
badly flawed vehicles. Some regulators say the gags erode their
oversight by making it hard for them to track vehicles that have
been branded as lemons.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler Corp.'s reselling of 116 such defective vehicles is
central to a two-year legal fight between the company and
California's Department of Motor Vehicles. In June, a Superior
Court judge ordered the dispute to be reconsidered again, and, in
effect, reinstated the proposed penalty _ the harshest by any state
for violations of lemon laws. The penalty, which has yet to take
effect, would bar Chrysler from shipping cars or trucks to the
state for 45 days. Chrysler has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Annually, about 100,000 vehicles are repurchased by auto makers
because of defects, including 5,000 to 10,000 in California, said
Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety in
Washington. He said consumer complaints often prompted
investigations by federal safety officials. ``If the gags are
widespread, you're going to dry up the source of complaints,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Charles Calderon, the Whittier Democrat who
co-sponsored the bill with Assemblyman Kevin Shelley, D-San
Francisco, said he expected Wilson to approve the legislation.
``Where the state has a responsibility to monitor safe products,
then secrecy makes no sense,'' Calderon said.
</P>
<P>
   In a Senate hearing last June, Mark Krause, a lobbyist for
defense lawyers, testified that the proposed legislation would
generate more litigation and work against consumers, making
automakers less likely to negotiate. ``By having a gag clause, it
sweetens the pot,'' he said. ``It makes it easier for manufacturers
to settle.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rosemary Shahan, president of Consumers for Auto Reliability
and Safety, an advocacy group in Sacramento that asked law makers
to introduce the bill, argued that ``gag clauses interfere with
agencies that are supposed to protect us.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the state Senate voted 21 to 12 to approve the
legislation, adding an amendment that permits secrecy on a
settlement's financial terms. On Tuesday, the state Assembly, which
had already endorsed the bill, approved the amendment 42-28.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Besides the Association for California Tort Reform, several
automakers also opposed the legislation. Ray Buttacavoli, regional
manager for General Motors Corp. in Sacramento, said most lemon-law
repurchases were voluntary. ``We feel we ought to be able to impose
conditions on those buybacks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Gomez, 48, a Moorpark, Calif., avocado grower, felt
vindicated when arbitrators deemed her 1996 Jeep Cherokee a lemon.
In its first year on the road, the car's drive shaft fell out
twice, once when Ms. Gomez' teen-age son was driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we returned the car, the very first thing they did was
shove a gag order in our face,'' Ms. Gomez said. ``It was
intimidation without legal representation; it was a threat to drag
it out.''
</P>
<P>
   A Chrysler representative eventually released a check to Ms.
Gomez, but only after she declared her intention to seek the help
of a consumer advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gomez's experience is typical, said Steven Solomon, a
Burlingame, Calif., lawyer who specializes in vehicle fraud. Most
consumers see a gag provision only in the final flurry of paper
signing, not during negotiations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In defending the use of gag clauses, Jonathan Sasser, a lawyer
for the Dupont subsidiary Conoco in Raliegh, N.C., told the
American Bar Association Journal in April that disclosing
settlement amounts will raise litigation costs by heightening
expectations of lawyers and their clients. ``It will raise the
value of settlements in the future and raise the costs of defending
these cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates are hopeful that California's ban on gag
clauses will be copied in other states. Yet the bill does not
establish a broader precedent that could be used to argue against
gag clauses in other consumer product settlements, said Judge
Thomas Whelan, presiding judge of San Diego Superior Court. ``The
statute is limited in its application,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of public furor over secrecy in some high-profile cases,
in the early 1990s San Diego's judges took the unusual step of
banning gag clauses in all cases in the local courts, permitting
them only by court approval. ``We look with disdain on secret
settlement agreements,'' Whelan said. ``Once they get us involved,
we aren't going to seal a court file.'' &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In her second and probably final appearance before
a grand jury here, Monica Lewinsky offered more specifics Thursday
about her sexual relationship with President Clinton and the gifts
he gave her as prosecutors sought to draw distinctions between her
testimony and that of the president only three days ago, lawyers
close to the case said.
</P>
<P>
   During the three-and-one-half-hour session, prosecutors bore in
on the events that led Ms. Lewinsky to return gifts from the
president that had been subpoenaed in the Paula Jones sexual
misconduct lawsuit last December, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The events surrounding the gifts are potentially the most
serious for the president because prosecutors are seeking to
determine whether he instructed Ms. Lewinsky to turn the gifts over
to his secretary, Betty Currie, rather than give them to lawyers
for Mrs. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky testified Thursday that she told Clinton last
December that the Jones subpoena demanded gifts he had given her, a
lawyer familiar with her account said. The president told her that
she could not turn over the gifts if they were not in her
possession, Ms. Lewinsky has told prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The day after her discussion with the president, Ms. Lewinsky
received a phone call from Ms. Currie, who told her, ``I hear you
have something for me,'' Ms. Lewinsky told the grand jury Thursday,
lawyers familiar with her account said. Ms. Lewinsky said that she
just assumed that Ms. Currie was referring to the gifts, the
lawyers said. Later that day, Ms. Currie went to Ms. Lewinsky's
apartment to retrieve the gifts, the lawyers said in their account
of her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But this account differs in some respects from Clinton's
testimony last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the prosecutors that he told Ms. Lewinsky in
December 1997 that she had no choice but to turn over gifts he had
given her to Mrs. Jones' lawyers, lawyers familiar with his
testimony said. When asked about the role of Ms. Currie, he said he
could not recall telling her to call Ms. Lewinsky about the gifts,
the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are also investigating whether Clinton kept some of
the gifts given to him by Ms. Lewinsky that had been subpoenaed by
lawyers in the Jones case, lawyers close to the case said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky offered more specifics of her sexual encounters
with the president than she gave in her testimony two weeks ago,
her friends and associates said. The specifics of their physical
contacts are also central to the prosecutors' case as they try to
determine whether Clinton committed perjury in a deposition in the
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, these people said, told the panel that he
intimately caressed her breasts and touched her genitals during
several encounters inside the White House. Her account was far more
detailed than the president's testimony Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Before he began Monday, Clinton admitted to the grand jury in a
statement supplied by his lawyers that he had had ``inappropriate
intimate physical contact'' with Ms. Lewinsky in the White House.
But the president repeatedly declined to discuss specific sexual
acts with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   As prosecutors continue to try to determine whether Clinton lied
in his January deposition in the Jones case, lawyers on both sides
continue to wrangle over what constitutes sexual conduct.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony Monday, Clinton argued that the type of
relationship he had with Ms. Lewinsky did not meet the definition
of sex used by Mrs. Jones' lawyers, lawyers close to the case said.
Three lawyers said he was implying that he had oral sex with Ms.
Lewinsky without testifying to that directly.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors are expected to argue that the acts described by
Ms. Lewinsky on Thursday fall within the definition of ``sexual
relations'' used by Mrs. Jones' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the testimony, prosecutors have obtained a sample of
Clinton's genetic material to determine whether it matches a semen
stain on a dress Ms. Lewinsky turned over to prosecutors, lawyers
close to the investigation said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI crime laboratory has determined that the stain on the
blue dress was semen, two officials briefed on the results said
Thursday. If the DNA in that stain matches the DNA sample from the
president, prosecutors would have forensic proof that the
president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was sexual.
</P>
<P>
   An adviser to the president said tonight that the DNA sample was
requested from Clinton last Friday and provided over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers familiar with Clinton's testimony Monday said
prosecutors asked him questions about the dress. Prosecutors
apparently considered it important to obtain forensic proof of the
relationship as well, perhaps anticipating that Clinton would
likely maintain that his contacts with Ms. Lewinsky did not fit the
definition in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   During Clinton's testimony Monday, prosecutors also asked the
president if he deliberately wore a necktie, given to him by Ms.
Lewinsky, during a Rose Garden appearance Aug. 6, the day Ms.
Lewinsky first testified before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he did not believe the gold and royal blue tie had
been a gift from her. He was then informed she had testified she
gave it to him, and the prosecutors asked if he had worn it that
day as some kind of a ``signal'' to her, perhaps to influence her
testimony. Clinton said again he could not remember if the tie came
from her. But he insisted that he had no intention of sending Ms.
Lewinsky any kind of message that day.
</P>
<P>
   The former White House intern, stone-faced and businesslike,
said nothing to reporters this morning as she climbed out of a
Toyota Land Cruiser and walked briskly into a side entrance of the
federal courthouse in Washington, ignoring a reporter's question
about whether Clinton should apologize to her. Friends have said
Ms. Lewinsky was deeply hurt by Clinton's address to the nation
Monday, especially since he did not apologize to her in it and
because she thought he was dismissive of their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Lewinsky's appearance drew a crowd of tourists and
gawkers, it was not as intensively covered by the news media as
when she first testified before the grand jury two weeks ago. But
her testimony was crucial as prosecutors search for discrepancies
between her account and the president's.
</P>
<P>
   She emerged from the courthouse just before 2 p.m., wearing dark
sunglasses, leaving her spokeswoman, Judy Smith, to meet with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``She answered all questions truthfully and completely,'' Ms.
Smith said. ``It is our expectation that today's appearance
concludes her grand jury testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Smith added, ``is now looking forward to
beginning the process of rebuilding her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, 25, had agreed to answer questions in exchange for
immunity from prosecution. In a deal worked out with prosecutors,
she is vulnerable to prosecution only if she lies in her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, spoke out Thursday
for the first time since Clinton accused him in a nationwide
address Monday of needlessly prying into his private life.
Responding to reporters' questions in Little Rock, Ark., Starr
would not say whether he felt vindicated by the president's
admission that he misled the American public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process is one of law, gathering facts and assessing them
and making professional judgments, as it should be,'' Starr said.
``A legal process should above all be aimed at achieving and
vindicating the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the legal maneuvering, debate has intensified at the
White House over the political fallout from the Lewinsky matter.
Many of the president's political advisers have complained that the
president was not properly apologetic in his nationwide address
Monday, and that his tone prompted harsh responses from Democrats
and Republicans alike.
</P>
<P>
   Some advisers have also complained that Clinton's lawyers have
been uncooperative and that they had wrongly assured them early
this year that Clinton's defense did not rely on specific
definitions of sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   As part of an effort to unite the legal and political teams,
David Kendall, Clinton's private lawyer, met Wednesday evening with
political advisers including deputy chief of staff John Podesta,
White House officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also said that in discussions that took place
before American cruise missiles struck targets in Afghanistan and
Sudan, aides also weighed whether Clinton should agree to a major
interview or another public appearance to tamp down criticism of
his speech Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, who has had many run-ins with the
White House related to the Starr investigation, Thursday reaffirmed
her confidence in Clinton as the leader of the administration. ``In
all my dealings with the president, he has been to me a person
dedicated to the issues of government,'' she said in response to a
reporter's question.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, White House officials did their best to play down Ms.
Lewinsky's testimony. ``I don't think that the president or the
White House has been particularly following her business today,''
said White House press secretary Mike McCurry.

SOME DRAW PARALLELS BETWEEN COMEDIC FILM, CLINTON DECISION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file and the ``e''
entertainment news file.) 
(Daily News movie critic Glenn Whipp contributed to this story.)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Journalists camped out at President Clinton's
vacation home on Martha's Vineyard were watching a satellite feed
of the movie ``Wag the Dog'' on Thursday when word came that a
major announcement was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The president, hounded by a sex scandal, was going to war in
real life just like in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   It was yet another ironic bit of life following art _ whether by
coincidence or design.
</P>
<P>
   First released late last year &UR;  &LR; and distributed widely in
January, just as the firestorm about the president's relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky ignitJ , ``Dog''
once again had tongues wagging throughout official Washington and
media centers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the satiric film, a presidential spin-doctoring team played
by Robert De Niro and Anne Heche recruits a Hollywood producer
(Dustin Hoffman) to stage a phony international crisis with Albania
to distract press and public attention from a sex scandal involving
the president and a Brownie-like Firefly Girl.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton announced that the U.S. military had struck
suspected terrorist bases in Afghanistan and Sudan on Thursday _
three days after finally admitting to the American people that he
and Lewinsky had had an improper relationship _ suspicions that
Hollywood was once again wagging Washington were immediately
rekindled.
</P>
<P>
   Except, typically, in official Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   New Line Cinema, which produced the movie based on Larry
Beinhart's novel ``American Hero,'' was deluged with press
inquiries about the parallels between ``Dog'' and current events.
So were publicists for the major talents who made the film.
</P>
<P>
   No New Line executives wanted to discuss the matter. De Niro, a
producer of the film, also declined comment. Hoffman was said to be
vacationing with his family on a boat, perhaps somewhere in the
Mediterranean, and unreachable. An assistant to playwright David
Mamet, who co-wrote the film's screenplay, said ``I almost didn't
pick up the phone because I knew what this call would be about. I
spoke to David earlier today and he has no comment on the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon Halls, a spokesman for the film's director, Barry
Levinson, another of its producers, Jane Rosenthal, and several of
its performers, summed up Hollywood's general response: This is a
real situation here and nobody wants to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Daily News conducted in February,
however, Levinson was quite vocal about the life-follows-film
parallels. At the time, America was rattling sabers against Iraq
over Saddam Hussein's blocking of weapon-plant inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment footage of Monica Lewinsky in that beret hit the
news, we became part of the lexicon with `Wag the Dog' syndrome,''
Levinson said. ``It's pretty surrealistic the way this movie
parallels real life, from the sex scandal and rumors of war running
in the paper side by side right down to the shot of our Firefly
Girl in a beret and Monica Lewinsky wearing a beret.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's eerie. There's never been just a sort-of connection. It's
exactly there. I keep waiting for Rod Serling to suddenly appear in
my kitchen and start narrating: There's this film director and
suddenly real events are happening because of a movie he made.
...''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS.) &QL;
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Of course, the similarities end at a certain point. No true
military action occurs within the film _ it's all faked on
Hollywood soundstages _ and there were no threats or events, such
as the recent Africa embassy bombings, to provoke America's
response.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Dog'' appears more prescient with each passing day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess `Wag the Dog' will go down in history as probably the
most perspicacious film of the 1990s,'' said Leonard Maltin,
``Entertainment Tonight'' film critic and editor of the annual
``Leonard Maltin's Movie and Video Guide.'' ``But we don't know the
whole story. Obviously, though, it's rare for life to imitate art
as strikingly as this one seems to have.''
</P>
<P>
   But Maltin cautioned against making glib connections between
film and reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's improper for the media to make these connections when
people are dying over this,'' he said. ``Of course, it comes in a
week when we're all living in the theater of the absurd. But I wish
people would remember where the real story is.''
</P>
<P>
   Author Beinhart dreamed up much of ``Dog's'' scenario in his
source novel ``American Hero'' _ which, however, did not involve a
sex scandal and was based on the premise that the Persian Gulf War
was manufactured in order to get George Bush re-elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``An issue in the book was whether it was fact or fiction,''
Beinhart said. ``The book claimed it was more real than reality,
and obviously the movie has more than come true. Now that they've
actually killed people, though, I don't feel as pleased and
facetious as I intended to be. It's a reminder that as funny as
government is, the bottom line is that they do get to kill people,
which there's nothing funny about.''
</P>
<P>
   Beinhart expressed no regret, and denies any responsibility, for
possibly inspiring Thursday's strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I and the movie reflected this event, rather than inspired
it,'' he said. ``If anything, I think it made them hesitate several
times, especially about going after Saddam Hussein again. They
probably figured back then that everyone would say they pulled a
`Wag the Dog.'''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking earlier this month, ``Dog'' co-star and longtime
Clinton supporter Heche recalled feeling awkward about meeting the
president around the time the Lewinsky scandal broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had just seen `Wag the Dog'; he was really lovely about
it,'' the actress noted. ``He said, I don't even know if I can
comment about that movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Heche was reminded that, during the initial promotional
interviews for ``Wag the Dog,'' she related that Hoffman once made
up a completely different story about what the movie was about when
the president asked him to describe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he wished that Dustin's version was true,'' Heche
said of the president.

   MCGWIRE MAKES FANS MANEUVER AT SHEA  
(Eds: See also BBN-METS-MCGWIRE, BBN-METS-CARDS) 
(mk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hopeful fans began stationing themselves in the
suddenly precious seats in the left-field loge section and the even
more precious perches in the picnic area in left center field more
than one hour before Mark McGwire was scheduled to take batting
practice at Shea Stadium Thursday. They arrived early because
finding a seat at Shea from which to corral one of McGwire's homers
is almost as difficult as sneaking into the bullpen for an inning.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Shea has a capacity of 55,775, only a fraction of
those seats are in fair territory behind the fences, so that made
those areas especially desirable for the spectators who attended
Thursday's doubleheader and who wanted a piece of history.
Normally, the sections next to left field and the picnic area are
empty for batting practice. Thursday, they were filled with fans
who then stood on their toes when McGwire batted against Willie
Blair in the first game.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some time, we have had people asking for seats in fair
territory on all levels,'' said Bill Ianniciello, vice president of
ticket sales and services. ``The phones have been very busy.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it McGwire mania. The man who has 51 homers _ connecting
off Blair in the opener and off Rick Reed in the second game in his
pursuit of Roger Maris' 37-year-old record of 61 homers in a season
_ is a bigger attraction than Beanie Babies and a team pushing for
a wild-card spot, at least in Flushing. Ianniciello said the
doubleheaders Thursday and Friday were expected to attract around
40,000 fans apiece and outdraw Saturday's game with the Arizona
Diamondbacks, in which the Mets are giving away a Beanie Baby named
Curly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three games have been selling comparably,'' Ianniciello
said. ``But, for the last three or four days, Thursday and Friday
have been outselling Saturday. As the games have gotten closer,
it's been McGwire.''
</P>
<P>
   All McGwire, all the time. He was cheered when he signed about
100 autographs along the left-field line, cheered before he struck
out against Blair in the first and cheered when he gave his broken
bat to a young girl after lining out in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine was asked whether he would rather watch
a team pursuing a wild-card spot or watch McGwire hammer homers if
he were a fan. He offered an answer that would make a politician
gleam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'd watch the Mets,'' Valentine said. ``When it got to
59, I'd go watch the Cards.''
</P>
<P>
   But the reason the Mets even discussed the slim possibility of a
sellout Thursday was McGwire's chase. Ianniciello admitted it and
Valentine conceded that the people who came probably wanted McGwire
to blast two homers and wanted the Mets to sweep. ``I think, for
the majority of the fans, that would be a perfect day for them,''
Valentine said before McGwire hit one and the Cardinals won, 2-0,
in the opener.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect day for a fan would include catching a McGwire homer,
which, once again, is not easy at Shea. Ianniciello said there are
about 1,300 seats in left, 1,300 seats in right field and another
600 seats in the picnic area that are in fair territory where a fan
could catch a possible homer.
</P>
<P>
   But there are far fewer fans who actually have a legitimate
chance for a home run ball because McGwire is unlikely to hit one
to right. He is unlikely to pound a ball into the upper deck, since
the Mets' Tommie Agee is the only player to have hit one there, and
the ball would need a compass and a map to reach half the seats in
the mezzanine and loge sections in left.
</P>
<P>
   The best place for camping under one of McGwire's homers at Shea
is the picnic area, which is usually available only for group
sales. But the Mets had groups who returned more than 200 tickets,
so the team offered them for sale and Ianniciello said most of them
were immediately scooped up. ``The picnic area would be my choice
to catch a ball,'' Ianniciello said.
</P>
<P>
   That was the perfect choice. McGwire lifted a 2-1 pitch off
Blair into the first row of the picnic area in the seventh for his
50th of the season. A fan in a T-shirt caught it, had it pop out of
his hands and then fought others to caress it to his chest. In the
first inning of the second game, McGwire homered into the loge
seats in left.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, after Mike Piazza whacked some long homers
in batting practice, McGwire, who was stretching beside the batting
cage, teasingly asked him, ``Can you give me a tip or what?'' It
caused Piazza, who ignored the cheering fans, to smile and imitate
McGwire's stance. McGwire laughed and then showed why no one can
really imitate him.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire clubbed two into the picnic area, hit four straight
homers at one point and finished the session with eight. As McGwire
was escorted to the third-base dugout after his show before the big
show, he softly flipped a baseball into the stands and watched the
fans turn into rugby players to scuffle for it. It was not a
McGwire home run ball. One of those came seven innings later and
another came early in the second game.

ELECTRIC SYSTEM LICENSED TO SCHWINN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Small, young Currie Technologies Inc. has given
bicycle giant Schwinn the power to pedal into the emerging market
for electric bikes.
</P>
<P>
   Currie, co-founded about two years ago by former Hughes Aircraft
Chief Executive Officer Malcolm Currie, has signed a licensing
agreement granting the Boulder, Colo.-based bicycle maker exclusive
use of its propulsion module system.
</P>
<P>
   The technology gives an otherwise ordinary bike a burst of power
with the flick of a thumb control and comes in handy, say, on one
of those pesky hills that can sap the energy of even the hardiest
cyclist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bike first, an electric bike second, and it gives you
all the power you need,'' said Richard Mayer, the company's
co-founder and executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Schwinn Cycling &AMP; Fitness had been looking for just the right
technology to propel it into the electric bike market, said Gregg
Bagni, vice president of marketing for the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be our very first electric bicycle,'' Bagni said.
``The way we look at it is we now have access to what we think is
the most innovative ... electric bicycle on the market today.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagni isn't the only one enthusiastic about the marriage between
Currie and Schwinn.
</P>
<P>
   This team could be the one to charge up the market for electric
bicycles in the United States, said Gary Coffrin, owner of San
Jose, Calif.-based Coffrin Group, which provides industry research
and consulting services to bicycle manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Electric bikes _ which emerged in Japan in 1994 _ are becoming
increasingly popular in some countries overseas, but have barely
rolled into the United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 253,000 of the total 8 million bicycles sold in
Japan last year were electric bikes, he said. In the United States,
by contrast, only 8,000 electric models were sold out of 11.5
million bikes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And in Europe, just two or so years ago there were no
manufacturers or suppliers of electric bikes, Coffrin said. Now
there are 64.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the electric bikes produced overseas that derive their
energy through pedal power, Coffrin said, Currie's technology
depends on a throttle that, flicked on, provides the bike with the
power the rider wants when he or she wants it.
</P>
<P>
   That makes the bike more versatile, and potentially more
attractive to consumers _ particularly the 76 million aging baby
boomers who are likeliest to buy the bike, and who grew up in an
era when Schwinn was synonymous with bikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could speed up America's acceptance for the electric bike,
and the visibility of the electric bike, by a solid year or two,''
Coffrin said about the team. ``The reason I believe that is that of
all the names you can put on the product to appeal to the aging
boomers, the number one name, I believe, by far is Schwinn.''
</P>
<P>
   Currie had already been selling another version of its
technology, the U.S. Pro-Drive electric bike, through independent
dealers and Sports Chalet, Currie Vice President Jack Pentlarge
said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the current Pro-Drive inventory is depleted, other bikes
produced by the company will carry the Schwinn name, Mayer said.
Currie and its dozen or so employees will remain in Van Nuys, a Los
Angeles suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schwinn will have a technologically advanced propulsion
system,'' he said. ``It is exclusive to them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that Currie has come up with a system that answers
most of the objections that have been raised'' about electric
bikes, Schwinn Chief Executive Officer Tom Mason said, pointing out
that Currie's system is lightweight, operates in all weather and
can be easily serviced at bike shops.
</P>
<P>
   Under the licensing agreement, Schwinn will essentially be
funding Currie, Mason said. ``We can turn that to an equity stake
in the future, if we wish,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schwinn plans to showcase the bike at the Interbike Trade Show
in Las Vegas on Sept. 11, according to Bagni. The bikes should be
on the market around year's end and sell for about $900. &QL;

LOPEZ FORMIDABLE, EVEN TO TOP FIGHTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERSEY CITY, N.J. _ In boxing there are lists of the top boxers
and lists of the boxers the top boxers will not fight. Among
welterweights, Jose Luis Lopez, ranked No. 2 by the World Boxing
Association, is at the top of both lists.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar De La Hoya, the World Boxing Council welterweight
champion, said that Lopez is the fighter he would least like to
face.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a logical way of thinking,'' Lopez said after a workout
at Marciano's Gym here Wednesday afternoon. ``He knows I am one of
the toughest opponents he will face and I will beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   He added later: ``No one has really punched him the way he needs
to be punched. No one has put the pressure on him the way he needs
to be pressured. No one has fought him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez (41-3-2 with 32 knockouts) does not lack confidence, but
with two nuclear warheads at the end of both arms, he should not.
Lopez will meet Ed Goins on the undercard of the Arturo Gatti-Ivan
Robinson show at Bally's Park Place in Atlantic City on Saturday
night as part of HBO's Boxing After Dark series. Fernando Vargas,
the brilliant young junior middleweight, will fight Darren
Maciunski on the same card.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said he does not know anything about Goins, and that is
one thing that veteran trainer Lou Duva likes about Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the only fighter I've handled who doesn't care who he's
fighting,'' said Duva, who co-manages Lopez. ``He'll fight anybody,
whether it's De La Hoya or Trinidad.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez put Ike Quartey on the canvas twice during their world
championship bout last Oct. 17 at Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut,
and fought to a 12-round draw. He calls it a wasted opportunity.
Two months later at Foxwoods, Lopez scored a five-round TKO against
Ronnie Johnson, but tested positive for marijuana. In his next
fight, on May 9 in Sacramento, he scored a second-round TKO over
Sammy Fuentes.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez presented a piece of paper with Spanish writing, showing
that he was clean during a test for marijuana that was conducted at
a lab in California on Aug. 14. Lopez said he is voluntarily taking
the test to show his promoters, Main Event, that he is clean and is
giving his all to win a championship.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hamed Has New Opponent &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prince Naseem Hamed and his London-based promoter, Frank Warren,
have ditched Kennedy McKinney as the opponent for Hamed's Oct. 31
bout in Las Vegas, Nev. Wayne McCullough, a native of Belfast,
Northern Ireland, who lives in Las Vegas, has replaced McKinney.
</P>
<P>
   It's a raw deal for McKinney, who has been waiting for eight
months through on-and-off negotiations and delays to fight Hamed.
The July 18 bout between the two was postponed, because Hamed was
said to have hurt his hand in training. But many believe he put off
the fight because he wanted to spend time with his new baby.
McKinney was to earn $750,000 for the bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prince is scared of Kennedy McKinney or Frank Warren is
the worst individual I've met in this game,'' said Murad Muhammad,
McKinney's promoter. ``It's got to be one or the other. I can't put
any intelligence to anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the match is a strange move considering that Hamed's
stated reason for fighting here was to face America's best
featherweights. A bout between Hamed of Sheffield, England, and
McCullough, who won a silver medal in the 1992 Olympics, in London
or Dublin would have been a major box office draw in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Quartey Loses Title &LR;   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ike Quartey's headaches got worse Wednesday. The World Boxing
Association stripped him of his welterweight title, because he
could not make his mandatory defense against No. 1 contender Andrei
Pestriaev of Russia. Quartey of Accra, Ghana, was supposed to fight
Pestriaev Thursday, but pulled out of the fight because malaria was
diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   A vacant title could open the way for Pestriaev and Jose Luis
Lopez, the No. 2 contender, to fight for the championship. Quartey
has a Nov. 14 date with Felix Trinidad, the International Boxing
Federation champion. If it does not come off, it won't be because
Quartey doesn't have his title. It will be because a Federal judge
in Manhattan would not grant Trinidad an injunction against the
promoter Don King.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad and King are involved in a legal wrangle over the
validity of Trinidad's contract with the promoter. Trinidad
recently signed a contract with Main Event as his promoters and
with HBO.  &QL;

COLLECTOR MARKET GETS A HIGH-PROFILE LIFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (See also CARS-SAFETY) 
(js) 
 By KEITH MARTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTEREY, Calif. _ The stock market may be gyrating, but the
classic car market is rocking and rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Each August, the eyes and wallets of the collector car world are
focused on the Monterey Peninsula in California. Over three days
there is a whirl of car activities, including the historic races at
Laguna Seca Raceway (where Porsche was the featured marque this
year), the Concours at Pebble Beach (which featured the
long-defunct Belgian manufacturer Minerva) and a series of
collector car auctions that set the tone for the vintage market for
the rest of the year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the two companies that held auctions here, Rick Cole
Auction Co. and Christie's, sold 176 cars between them for a total
of $14 million. This year, the auction landscape was altered by the
sale of one company when Rick Cole was bought by Rob Myers' RM
Productions of Toronto and became the Monterey Sports Car Auction,
and the entrance of another when Robert Brooks, a British auction
house, made its U.S. debut. Market watchers worried that the
continuing collapse of Japan's vintage car market would depress
sales; others felt that with the uncertainty surrounding the stock
market, some big collectors might not buy. All were concerned that
Brooks' entry into the already crowded weekend would dilute sales
for everyone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But by the time the last hammer had fallen on Sunday night at
the Christie's sale, the market had gathered new steam. The three
auctions sold a total of 253 cars for nearly $30.5 million _ more
than double the amount a year earlier. The average price per car
jumped to $120,000, from $79,500.
</P>
<P>
   At all three auctions, it was the big-ticket cars that broke
sales records, while prices of regular production cars remained
within the expected price ranges. Each auction company had its
star. For Brooks, it was a 1908 French-built Mors Grand Prix
two-seater with a 775-cubic-inch engine _ equivalent to
one-and-a-half Dodge Viper motors. One of the earliest surviving
Grand Prix cars, it sold for $690,000 including buyer's commission,
nearly $300,000 above the low end of the pre-auction estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The Monterey Sports Car Auction had two spectacular racing
Jaguars. A 1959 D-type, one of 77 built, sold for $952,300. An
unrestored 1963 factory-built lightweight XKE competition roadster,
one of 16, brought a monumental $872,000, nearly $300,000 above the
low end of the estimates and a testimony to the appeal of original,
unrestored cars. The XKE had covered just 2,600 miles since it was
made and was discovered in a garage after 35 years of storage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Christie's had three show-stoppers. The first was a somewhat
mundane 1989 Jaguar XJ-S V12 coupe, in excellent condition and
driven fewer than 10,000 miles, that had been owned by Frank
Sinatra. Estimated to sell at $10,000 to $15,000, the final price
including commission was an astounding $178,500. Another Jaguar, a
rare 1957 XKSS roadster, was one of only 18 made. It had been
driven fewer than 12,000 miles, and the auction catalog asserted
that it still had the original, 1957 air in the tires. In
extraordinary unrestored condition, having been stored since 1967,
it brought $1,014,500 _ $300,000 above the low estimate.
</P>
<P>
   A 1967 Ferrari 275 GTS/4 NART Spyder brought Christie's the
weekend's top price, $2,092,500. But the loudest cheers in the
auction tent were reserved for the buyer of a striking 1935 Alfa
Romeo 8C-35 Grand Prix car. Painstakingly restored, though not
completely original, it went for $1,322,500, some $300,000 above
the low estimate. &QL;

DIFFERING EXITS FOR SAMPRAS AND RAFTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ Tennis icons do not usually have to deal with
heckling, but there was plenty of it on the stadium court Thursday
at the Pilot Pen International. Faithful fans who had waited a
decade for Pete Sampras to make a second appearance at this
beleaguered event watched in indignation as the top-seeded player
came to a virtual standstill instead of standing up to the spoiler,
100th-ranked Leander Paes of India.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more vocal spectators harangued Sampras to at least
make a pretense of caring about his performance, earning a
condemnatory stare from the player. Others booed Sampras when he
left the court after displaying little resistance during the 6-3,
6-4 throttling he received. Sampras said he did not lose the match
intentionally, but admitted he did not even begin to rise to the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't the player that I am usually out there,'' said
Sampras, who has not won any of the three hardcourt events he
entered this summer to prepare for the United States Open, which
begins Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the swan song of Sampras, whose passivity prompted
suspicion about his motivation, second-seeded Patrick Rafter's exit
on the overcrowded grandstand court prompted compassion rather than
catcalls. A fan favorite here, where he was runner-up to Yevgeny
Kafelnikov last year, Rafter was apologetic after he and his
career-best 11-match winning streak ran out of steam, flummoxed,
7-6 (10-8), 6-3, by the clever returns and passing shots of
48th-ranked Guillaume Raoux of France.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to lose sometime, so there's no use crying about
it,'' said Rafter, ``but I tried everything and he came up with
every answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to panic because I wasn't making any inroads on his
serve; when I was coming in he was hurting me, and when I stayed
back he was hurting me,'' said Rafter, whose zinc oxide mask had
melted away from the prolonged heat of the moment even before Raoux
ended the excruciating first-set tie breaker with a cruel backhand
drop volley on his fourth set point.
</P>
<P>
   So each in his own way, and with a very different reception from
the crowd, the two titans now chasing Marcelo Rios and his No. 1
ranking, Sampras the Wimbledon champion and Rafter the Unites
States Open champion, found themselves chased out of the third
round by a pair of pretenders who were rewarded for having humbler
goals: Paes and Raoux simply wanted to make it to the
quarterfinals, and did.
</P>
<P>
   Raoux knew that what constituted dream victories for Paes and
himself represented a box office nightmare to Butch Buchholz, the
tournament director. ``To the tournament director, I'm sorry, and
Leander's sorry; tell him I have some pills if he's afraid of not
sleeping tonight,'' Raoux joked.
</P>
<P>
   Buchholz, who rescued this event from limbo and hopes to
transform it into a coed blockbuster in the image of his Lipton
Championships at Key Biscayne, Fla., was sufficiently rattled by
the day's twin upsets to hold a brief news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Besides denying that the loss of Sampras and Rafter would
cripple the tournament, Buchholz took pains to deny the rumor that
he and the rest of the Pilot Pen's organizers were furious at
Sampras for surrendering without a serious fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete tried; I don't think Pete tanked,'' said Buchholz, who
was instrumental in persuading Sampras to play here instead of
Indianapolis. ``After all, you do have bad hair days.''
</P>
<P>
   But Buchholz was hard pressed to expand his defense of Sampras,
the 11-time Grand Slam champion who is chasing Roy Emerson's record
of 12.
</P>
<P>
   Buchholz instead took a realistic view of what transpired.
``Pete's in a stage right now where, well, at 21 or 22 you might
dig a little deeper,'' he said, ``but today he's on a quest to
pass, or to catch, Emerson, and probably doesn't have the same
intensity he might have had here at 21, 22.''
</P>
<P>
   Paes, whose only career title came this year on the grass at
Newport, had to survive last weekend's qualifying to earn a berth
in this event.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people pay good money to see me play, and they expect to
see me win,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm playing well it looks like I'm a genius, and when I'm
not, I'm tanking.''  &QL; 
MATCH POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov defeated 11th-seeded Gustavo
Kuerten, 6-4, 6-4, fourth-seeded Richard Krajicek crushed Harel
Levy, 6-2, 6-4, and Goran Ivanisevic, who later chastised the
linesmen for being ``too old'' to see the ball, dismissed Nicolas
Kiefer, 6-3, 7-5. &QL;

`COMMUNICATING DOORS': BACKPEDALING, COMICALLY, INTO A MENACING
FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at the end of review.) 
(js) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Don't even think of putting up a struggle:
Mary-Louise Parker is irresistible in ``Communicating Doors,'' Alan
Ayckbourn's comic thriller of men with blood on their hands and
women with time on theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Her last stage appearance, in the Pulitzer Prize-winning ``How I
Learned to Drive,'' found Ms. Parker the wounded party in a story
of sexual victimization. This time, she's the highly compensated
sexual aggressor, a jaded London prostitute named Poopay who
stumbles into a murder plot that sends her, care of an extremely
unique set of hotel doors, traveling back in time.
</P>
<P>
   When she first enters David Gallo's plush mock-up of a room at
the Regal Hotel in a blonde bob, dragonfly tattoo and skin-tight
patent leather, Ms. Parker looks as if she's ready for anything,
perhaps even a cameo in ``The Night Porter.'' But when she is
cornered in a bathroom by a menacing hotel guest played by a
hulking Gerrit Graham, Poopay's charade strips rapidly away, and
all that is left is an anxious little moppet with a riding crop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a dominatrix,'' the moony-eyed actress declares, in a
delightfully puny, defensive voice. The naughty-girl lost-girl
duality in Ms. Parker's comic performance is such that your heart
goes out to this misguided soul, whips and chains and all. And her
Poopay is all the more impressive given that ``Communicating
Doors,'' which opened Thursday night at the Variety Arts Theater,
is not exactly rich in character detail.
</P>
<P>
   The play, about a quarter-inch deep, is an inventive but not a
brilliant diversion. It's minor Ayckbourn, the kind of pleasant
entertainment that's ideal for a rainy afternoon when you're
feeling cooped up and in need of something to take your mind off
the stack of bills and sink full of dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Ayckbourn, whose plays are worked out with the intricacy of
whaling ships carved in scrimshaw, is riffing on a staple of the
British stage, the parlor-room murder mystery, though
``Communicating Doors'' is not so much a whodunit as
howdotheygetoutofit.
</P>
<P>
   One of the playful notions is that the unchanging hotel room is
actually three distinct settings in the years 2018, 1998 and 1978,
reached via the connecting, or communicating, doors between rooms
that serve as an unlikely time machine. Poopay and the two other
heroines, played by Patricia Hodges and Candy Buckley, travel back
and forth in time in a literal race against the clock: they are
trying to rewrite history and, in the process, prevent their own
violent ends.
</P>
<P>
   The race begins when Ms. Parker, in the London of 2018, is hired
for an evening at the Regal by a pair of odd characters, Julian (
Graham) and Reece (Tom Beckett), the latter a wheezing and
desperately ill old man apparently desirous of one last fling. But
once Reece gets Poopay alone, he reveals his true intention: he
wants her to co-sign his confession to the murders of his wives
Ruella (Ms. Hodges) in 1998 and Jessica (Ms. Buckley) 20 years
before that.
</P>
<P>
   Julian intrudes, Poopay escapes into the vestibule and somehow
triggers the time machine. The lights go down, the doors spin and
suddenly it's 20 years earlier. Ah, but like an elaborate board
game that can be learned only by playing it, there are unforeseen
rules in time travel. Poopay apparently can only travel back 20
years, and Ruella, in turn, 20 years back to Jessica's time.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of painstakingly devised plot, so specifically
designed for one set of circumstances, that you either buy or you
don't. And the kind that, when it plays itself out, compels you
into arguments about its logic. How come only 20 years? Why can't
the house detective, the enjoyable David McCallum, time-travel,
too? Does the whole world change as a result of Poopay's and
Ruella's tinkerings with history, or just the lives in question?
There are enough subtle touches along the way, including a seeming
political disintegration of the city, to keep you looking for
telling details.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Stage comedies that try to keep a straight face about the
murderous element in their stories are deceptively difficult to
pull off. The laughs have to be as well-crafted as the twists.
Fortunately, Ayckbourn has both the patience for this sort of
construction and an ear for the devilish one-liner. But it may be
too early in the life of Christopher Ashley's less than crackling
production to expect the well-oiled ensemble work the play's
machinery calls for. There is something lacking on the evening's
sinister side, especially in a long expository first scene that
fails to establish any palpable tension or suspense.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that while Ms. Parker is fetchingly
believable in her role, not everyone is cast quite as well. In a
play so dependent on crispness, the lapses tend to stand out and an
audience's confidence is undermined. Beckett, for instance, is far
too callow for Reece, even though he begins the play as a man of 70
and must also play a 30-year-old. In makeup as an old man, he
actually manages to look 20. Graham, too, saddled with the
lugubrious villain's role, all but trudges across the set with arms
outstretched like Frankenstein. Watching McCallum make such easy
work of the befuddled hotel security man, Harold, you find yourself
wishing that he could have played all the male parts.
</P>
<P>
   The women fare better. Ms. Hodges, in a role that apparently won
acclaim in London for Julia McKenzie, gets right the brutality of
upper-class English charm. Her Ruella has enough pluck for a
squadron of RAF pilots _ she's even pleased to learn from Poopay,
in a well-that-settles-that sort of resoluteness, how she's
supposed to die. And Ms. Buckley finds a Fergie-like freshness in
Jessica. The three women are particularly good in an extended
slapstick scene on the room's balcony; Ms. Parker's rubbery
contortions, as she and Ms. Buckley hold on to Ms. Hodges for dear
life, convey exactly the kind of desperate absurdity Ayckbourn is
after.
</P>
<P>
   Even if gags like those seem recycled from other plays and
movies, ``Communicating Doors'' finds a certain virtue in a
marriage of gimmickry old and new. As is often the case with
Ayckbourn, all the tumblers eventually fall into place.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mark McGwire was the main attraction on a glorious
baseball stage in New York Thursday night and was expected to
perform like some sort of home run-hitting robot. Push a button,
then watch him swing his bat and blast another homer. And, oddly
enough, McGwire somehow made it look that simple against the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire pounded two more homers for his 50th and 51st of the
season as the Cardinals grabbed the first game, 2-0, before
succumbing to the Mets, 5-4, in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Just about everyone who bought a ticket to Shea Stadium wanted
to see McGwire go deep and see history, and that they did.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire exhibited a rare display of emotion following his first
homer of the day, off Willie Blair in the opener, as he became the
first player in major league history to drill 50 homers in three
straight seasons, eclipsing Babe Ruth's record of two straight
seasons, which Ruth accomplished twice.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire pumped his fist twice, clapped his hands twice and
shouted something to himself as he rounded the bases and received a
rousing ovation from the enemy-turned-envious fans.
</P>
<P>
   While McGwire was more subdued when he homered off Rick Reed in
the second game, the red-headed superstar with the tight end's
frame continued to add to the notion that he will surpass Roger
Maris' 37-year-old record of 61 homers in a season.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire had said the chase would become serious if a player
reached 50 by Sept. 1. He has hit 51 with 11 days to spare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamt of being in this position,'' McGwire said
before smashing the two homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dreamt about being a big leaguer,'' he added. ``Things
happen for a reason. Hard work pays off.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire uncorked his powerful swing off Blair's 2-1 slider in
the seventh inning of the opener and gazed toward left field as the
ball soared in that direction. There were more than 40,000 pairs of
eyes gazing into the blue sky with McGwire, but his eyes were the
most expressive. He could not stop looking at the ball. No one
could as it landed 369 feet away in the left-field picnic area.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's historic homer followed Brian Jordan's homer and
helped St. Louis roll in the first game, which turned into a
footnote. Even the fans who were hoping the Mets could maintain or
improve their one-half game lead over the Chicago Cubs for the
wild-card playoff spot stood and cheered as McGwire retreated to
the dugout. He peered at the fans and waved.
</P>
<P>
   It obviously bothered manager Bobby Valentine that the fans
treated McGwire as if he had ``NY'' on his cap, but the Mets
regained some support in the second game by erasing a 4-1 deficit
with two runs in the fourth on Mike Piazza's 464-foot homer and two
more in the seventh on Rey Ordonez's run-scoring double and Tony
Phillips' RBI groundout. The Mets made sure the night was not all
about McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis first baseman ignored the growing attention,
scoffed at the mounting pressure and did exactly what virtually
everyone in Flushing wanted him to do by plastering his 50th. It is
hard enough to hit a round ball 400 feet with a round bat, and it
should be even harder when everyone is expecting it. But McGwire
made it a night to remember for his newfound friends by injecting
his 51st for those among the crowd of 45,308 who were tardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he hits his 50th homer, that would be a good memory in 20
years,'' Valentine said before the contest. ``That would be a
cherished memory, rather than I was at a doubleheader when the Mets
did whatever we do tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words were uttered before Shea became Busch Stadium East.
It was respectful to applaud McGwire, but the first setback dropped
the Mets into a tie with the Cubs and the reaction disappointed
Valentine. When he was asked about the fans cheering an opponent,
Valentine said, ``I don't have any comment on that,'' with an
expression that said much more.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, who was impressive in allowing two runs and three hits in
his first Mets start, was not upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the first player to ever hit 50 in three straight
years,'' Blair said. ``It's a great feat. He deserves it.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who was one for 15 with nine strikeouts off Blair
before the homer, said that it is uncomfortable when everyone in
the world is watching him, but he handled the attention with aplomb
by carrying his own marker to sign autographs and then supplying
the highlight everyone hoped for. Donovan Osborne no-hit the Mets
for five and one-third innings and finished with a four-hitter
through eighth innings, and his results were superfluous.
</P>
<P>
   With McGwire unavailable to reporters between games, the
Cardinals released a statement in which he said: ``It's nice to be
part of major league history and to have done so in such a historic
baseball city as New York. I broke Babe Ruth's record just across
town from the stadium he played in.''
</P>
<P>
   Then McGwire accentuated it by pummeling Reed's 3-2 pitch into
the left-field screen in the first inning of the second game, a
385-foot shot. McGwire whiffed for the third time this year against
Turk Wendell with the Cardinals down by a run in the eighth, but it
was still an unforgettable night in his robot-like pursuit of
Maris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like him to do it,'' Blair said. ``If anybody does it, I'd
like to see him do it.''

SOME DRAW PARALLELS BETWEEN COMEDIC FILM, CLINTON DECISION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``a'' national news file and the ``n''
California news file.) 
(Daily News movie critic Glenn Whipp contributed to this story.) 
BY BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Journalists camped out at President Clinton's
vacation home on Martha's Vineyard were watching a satellite feed
of the movie ``Wag the Dog'' on Thursday when word came that a
major announcement was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The president, hounded by a sex scandal, was going to war in
real life just like in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   It was yet another ironic bit of life following art _ whether by
coincidence or design.
</P>
<P>
   First released late last year &UR;  &LR; and distributed widely in
January, just as the firestorm about the president's relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky ignited, ``Dog''
once again had tongues wagging throughout official Washington and
media centers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the satiric film, a presidential spin-doctoring team played
by Robert De Niro and Anne Heche recruits a Hollywood producer
(Dustin Hoffman) to stage a phony international crisis with Albania
to distract press and public attention from a sex scandal involving
the president and a Brownie-like Firefly Girl.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton announced that the U.S. military had struck
suspected terrorist bases in Afghanistan and Sudan on Thursday _
three days after finally admitting to the American people that he
and Lewinsky had had an improper relationship _ suspicions that
Hollywood was once again wagging Washington were immediately
rekindled.
</P>
<P>
   Except, typically, in official Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   New Line Cinema, which produced the movie based on Larry
Beinhart's novel ``American Hero,'' was deluged with press
inquiries about the parallels between ``Dog'' and current events.
So were publicists for the major talents who made the film.
</P>
<P>
   No New Line executives wanted to discuss the matter. De Niro, a
producer of the film, also declined comment. Hoffman was said to be
vacationing with his family on a boat, perhaps somewhere in the
Mediterranean, and unreachable. An assistant to playwright David
Mamet, who co-wrote the film's screenplay, said ``I almost didn't
pick up the phone because I knew what this call would be about. I
spoke to David earlier today and he has no comment on the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon Halls, a spokesman for the film's director, Barry
Levinson, another of its producers, Jane Rosenthal, and several of
its performers, summed up Hollywood's general response: This is a
real situation here and nobody wants to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Daily News conducted in February,
however, Levinson was quite vocal about the life-follows-film
parallels. At the time, America was rattling sabers against Iraq
over Saddam Hussein's blocking of weapon-plant inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment footage of Monica Lewinsky in that beret hit the
news, we became part of the lexicon with `Wag the Dog' syndrome,''
Levinson said. ``It's pretty surrealistic the way this movie
parallels real life, from the sex scandal and rumors of war running
in the paper side by side right down to the shot of our Firefly
Girl in a beret and Monica Lewinsky wearing a beret.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's eerie. There's never been just a sort-of connection. It's
exactly there. I keep waiting for Rod Serling to suddenly appear in
my kitchen and start narrating: There's this film director and
suddenly real events are happening because of a movie he made.
...''

SOCCER'S RISE MARKS ROTHERNBERG'S REIGN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Truth be known, Alan Rothenberg was thrust upon a U.S. Soccer
Federation that didn't know him, didn't want him and had no say in
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later his imprint on American soccer is indelible,
his presence towering over the sport, his fingerprints on
everything that has gone toward the tremendous growth it has
enjoyed here during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic and incisive, Rothenberg whose presidency ends this
weekend has guided U.S. Soccer, and through it the sport as a
whole, through a renaissance that created a landscape not thought
possible in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Without him, none of it would have been.
</P>
<P>
   When Rothenberg took charge of USSF, it was a mom-and-pop-styled
organization working with a $3 million budget and about a
half-dozen full-time employees. It had limited power, fewer
resources, no place within America's sporting culture ... and the
right to put on the 1994 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg, it turned out, was part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Criticized worldwide for its 1988 decision to award the Cup to
the United States and more than a little fearful of the
consequences, FIFA the world's governing body for soccer
hand-picked the Beverly Hills attorney, with whose handling of the
1984 Olympic soccer tournament it had been impressed, and gave the
federation a mandate: Make Rothenberg your president, or we'll take
away the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The choice wasn't simple Rothenberg was derided as a
``carpetbagger'' within the fiercely provincial soccer community
but it was easy, and the payoff has been immense:
</P>
<P>
   --The 1994 World Cup, which brought the sport into the American
conscious, demonstrated to the world that we were ready to play
(ITAL) its (ITAL) games, paved the way for a professional league,
and made a cool $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   --U.S. Soccer's growth from an inconsequential group into a huge
organization with a $38 million budget, hundreds of employees, a
nine-figure Nike deal, an expansive television contract, successful
national teams (playing before big crowds in big stadiums), a
relationship with the disenfranchised ethnic communities and plans
to create a developmental program designed to win a World Cup in
the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   --Major League Soccer, which provides plenty of jobs for
American soccer players, plenty of soccer for American fans and
lots of exposure for the sport.
</P>
<P>
   --The U.S. Soccer Foundation, which dispenses the capital off
the '94 Cup money to develop the sport in America, funding programs
to build fields, take the game to inner cities and making better
players, coaches and referees.
</P>
<P>
   --The Women's World Cup coming to these shores next summer which
wants to do for women's soccer what the '94 Cup did for soccer in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he's brought key people USSF Secretary General
Hank Steinbrecher, former national team coach Bora Milutinovic, MLS
Deputy Commissioner Sunil Gulati and national teams general manager
Tom King into the American game and created a model, certain to be
followed, for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was elected, my plan was to do five things,'' said
Rothenberg, 59, who is in Hawaii for U.S. Soccer's Annual General
Meeting and Saturday's election. ``Professionalize the federation,
bring some unity to the disparate forces in (American) soccer,
build the national teams program, put on a successful World Cup,
and start a professional league. We accomplished all of them, and
we did all of them well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Alan is certainly a charismatic guy,'' Steinbrecher told
Soccer America. ``I think whoever the new president will be will
have very, very big shoes to fill.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg's influence will continue to be felt. He remains on
U.S. Soccer's executive board and on the foundation board and
chairs its marketing board, he's a CONCACAF vice president, is
chairman of the Women's World Cup organizing committee and is
expected to play some role in new FIFA president Sepp Blatter's
organization. He also heads a group that paid $25 million for MLS's
San Jose Clash.
</P>
<P>
   There also is talk that Rothenberg would retain the real power
should Dr. Robert Contiguglia, a Denver kidney specialist, be
elected president on Saturday he's running against retired
D.C.-area lawyer Larry Monaco; Rothenberg has endorsed Contiguglia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't intend to leave the sport,'' Rothenberg says. ``I'll
be very active, but I won't be the guy who has to do it day in and
day out. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I never, (ITAL) never (ITAL) realized what I was getting into.
I had no idea what was in store. Only half-jokingly I've said if I
had known the amount of work involved, I probably wouldn't have
run. I'm glad I didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``These have been exciting times and I'm proud to have been
apart of it.''

LOS ANGELES: movie he made. ...'' 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of course, the similarities end at a certain point. No true
military action occurs within the film _ it's all faked on
Hollywood soundstages _ and there were no threats or events, such
as the recent Africa embassy bombings, to provoke America's
response.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Dog'' appears more prescient with each passing day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess `Wag the Dog' will go down in history as probably the
most perspicacious film of the 1990s,'' said Leonard Maltin,
``Entertainment Tonight'' film critic and editor of the annual
``Leonard Maltin's Movie and Video Guide.'' ``But we don't know the
whole story. Obviously, though, it's rare for life to imitate art
as strikingly as this one seems to have.''
</P>
<P>
   But Maltin cautioned against making glib connections between
film and reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's improper for the media to make these connections when
people are dying over this,'' he said. ``Of course, it comes in a
week when we're all living in the theater of the absurd. But I wish
people would remember where the real story is.''
</P>
<P>
   Author Beinhart dreamed up much of ``Dog's'' scenario in his
source novel ``American Hero'' _ which, however, did not involve a
sex scandal and was based on the premise that the Persian Gulf War
was manufactured in order to get George Bush re-elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``An issue in the book was whether it was fact or fiction,''
Beinhart said. ``The book claimed it was more real than reality,
and obviously the movie has more than come true. Now that they've
actually killed people, though, I don't feel as pleased and
facetious as I intended to be. It's a reminder that as funny as
government is, the bottom line is that they do get to kill people,
which there's nothing funny about.''
</P>
<P>
   Beinhart expressed no regret, and denies any responsibility, for
possibly inspiring Thursday's strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I and the movie reflected this event, rather than inspired
it,'' he said. ``If anything, I think it made them hesitate several
times, especially about going after Saddam Hussein again. They
probably figured back then that everyone would say they pulled a
`Wag the Dog.'''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking earlier this month, ``Dog'' co-star and longtime
Clinton supporter Heche recalled feeling awkward about meeting the
president around the time the Lewinsky scandal broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had just seen `Wag the Dog'; he was really lovely about
it,'' the actress noted. ``He said, I don't even know if I can
comment about that movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Heche was reminded that, during the initial promotional
interviews for ``Wag the Dog,'' she related that Hoffman once made
up a completely different story about what the movie was about when
the president asked him to describe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he wished that Dustin's version was true,'' Heche
said of the president.
