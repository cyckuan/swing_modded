<HEADLINE> EU Ministers Insist on Doping Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PADERBORN, Germany (AP) -- European Union sports ministers  
remained on a collision course with some major sports by insisting 
Wednesday on a two-year ban for first-time doping offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	A joint statement issued after a two-day informal meeting of the  
15 ministers said a planned worldwide anti-doping agency should be 
independent and empowered to impose sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Otto Schily, Germany's interior minister and chairman of the  
meeting, said the ministers had agreed about the two-year ban, 
although he conceded that there could be legal problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``An international system of sanctions is needed, such as a  
minimum ban of two years for first-time offenders,'' Schily said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have to check it legally though,'' Schily said. ``Our  
goal remains to have a strict and hard punishment for doping 
violations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several major sports, such as soccer, cycling and tennis, are  
opposed to a two-year ban, arguing that such a punishment for a 
first offense would never hold up to challenges under right-to-work 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Schily met later in the day with Sepp Blatter, president of  
FIFA, soccer's world governing body, and the two men indicated a 
possible compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are differences of opinion on the legal interpretation  
of the minimum punishment,'' Schily said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we've agreed that these differences should be examined by  
a panel of international experts,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blatter said FIFA must be flexible.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to set up in-training controls through our  
national federations and perhaps impose punishments that would go 
beyond the minimum two-year ban,'' Blatter told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting in Lausanne in February, the 15 EU governments and  
the International Olympic Committee failed to agree on an 
anti-doping program. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU governments refused to allow the IOC a lead role in the  
proposed anti-doping agency, which would supervise worldwide drug 
testing and policy and have an initial budget of $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint statement said it would be ``desirable'' for the  
agency to be based in one of the EU capitals and not in Lausanne, 
which also serves as the seat of the IOC.

<HEADLINE>  Blazers' Rider Vows To Be Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- After strong performances in the first two  
rounds of the playoffs, Isaiah Rider of the Portland Trail Blazers 
was happy to at last be recognized for his basketball ability 
instead of his off-court problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Things haven't gone so well for him, though, in the Western  
Conference finals. Rider scored 16 points in the two games in San 
Antonio, half of them in the third quarter of Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	To make matters worse, his already sore right knee locked up in  
the third quarter of Game 2. And, much to his obvious displeasure, 
he didn't play at all in the fourth quarter, when San Antonio 
rallied for an 86-85 victory to take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-7 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just didn't look like he was playing at the same level  
physically,'' Portland coach Mike Dunleavy said. ``He may at times 
thought he was OK. But it looked like he was thinking about his 
knee a whole lot, rubbing it, favoring it a little bit, not running 
as hard as he could run. Maybe it didn't look that way to anybody 
else but it was kind of noticeable to me. I look for him to come 
back and have a big third game for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rider said after his team's workout Wednesday that he will be  
ready to play when the series resumes Friday night at Portland's 
Rose Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just really sore,'' he said. ``It just locked up on me. I  
popped it out and made it swell and made it really sore. It has a 
spot there that's really tender. It's just a freak thing really.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The injury occurred in the first round against Phoenix, when Tom  
Gugliotta jumped into Rider's knee going for a loose ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider averaged 19 points per game in the Blazers' series  
victories against Phoenix and Utah, and he said he is accepting his 
more limited role against San Antonio, when Portland has focused on 
the matchup advantages Rasheed Wallace has at forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course I want the ball, that's just me,'' Rider said. ``I'd  
like to turn it up at any point in time. But I don't want to go out 
there and take all kinds of crazy shots just because I did well in 
the first two series. I still want to play in the confines of our 
team and not be an outcast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same could be said for Damon Stoudamire, who hates the fact  
that Dunleavy usually benches him in the fourth quarter in favor of 
Greg Anthony. When Stoudamire finally did get to play down the 
stretch in Game 2, he hit several jumpers but also had a big 
turnover and missed a critical free throw. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I sit in the fourth quarter, I won't be happy. That's just  
the bottom line,'' Stoudamire said. ``I'm going to accept it but I 
won't be happy about it. ... I'll get over this, but I'm never 
going to forget it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, Dunleavy said that the decision on who plays in the  
fourth quarter will be based on matchups and how each player is 
doing to that point. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Grant left the Blazers' practice early because of illness.  
Dunleavy said it was an upper respiratory problem and Grant should 
be able to play Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunleavy had an easy summation of how the Blazers got down two  
games despite outplaying San Antonio for much of the first two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably should be 1-1,'' he said. ``With a little luck, we  
could be 2-0. With a little luck, they are 2-0.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs worked out in San Antonio Wednesday before flying to  
Portland. Antonio Daniels stayed home with what doctors think is 
strep throat. He is to fly to Portland on Friday but is 
questionable for Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs expressed caution as the series shifted to Portland.  
San Antonio has beaten the Blazers five in a row, but every game 
has been close, none more so than Game 2 Monday night, when Sean 
Elliott's tip-toe 3-pointer from the sideline made the difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just know we can't keep relying on last-second shots to beat  
Portland,'' Avery Johnson said, ``because sooner or later, it runs 
out. You've got to play solid basketball for 48 minutes. We didn't 
play for 48 minutes. That's why I thought we had a serious sense of 
concentration in practice today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going up there humbled, knowing that we haven't played  
our best basketball yet.''

<HEADLINE> Freddie Mercury Stamp Under Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A commemorative stamp depicting Freddie Mercury  
has drawn objections from critics who call it inappropriate for the 
Royal Mail to feature the flamboyant singer. 
</P>
<P>
	The stamps honoring Mercury, the late lead singer of Queen, are  
part of a series noting Britain's various achievements during the 
last millennium. But some people have objected to the inclusion of 
a bisexual who died of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	``The queen we would rather see on our postage stamps is not  
stripped to the waist and wearing spray-on red trousers,'' 
columnist Simon Heffer wrote last week in the tabloid Daily Mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Heffer attacked the stamp as a ``vulgar'' commemoration of a  
star ``whose degenerate lifestyle caused him to die of AIDS at an 
unfortunately early age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others objected because a tiny portion of the stamp also shows  
Queen drummer Roger Taylor, which violates the Royal Mail's rule 
that only members of the royal family are depicted on stamps during 
their lifetimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Royal Mail issued a statement standing by the stamp, which  
went on sale Tuesday, saying the organization was proud to have 
Mercury depicted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every stamp is approved by the queen, including this one,  
which was also given the consent of Freddie Mercury's family and by 
Mr. Taylor,'' the statement said.

<HEADLINE>  Knicks' Ewing Out for Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Patrick Ewing, who played through injuries all  
season, will miss the rest of the playoffs for the New York Knicks 
because of a partially torn Achilles' tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing underwent tests this morning that confirmed the injury,  
just hours after he missed a potential tying shot at the buzzer in 
Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Pacers in 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing does not need surgery and a full recovery is expected, Dr.  
Norman Scott, the team's physician, said today. The 36-year-old 
center will be in a cast for six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
		   Ewing told Scott before Tuesday night's game that he felt a  
``ripping sensation'' during warmups. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Ewing played, limping much of the game. He scored  
10 points and grabbed three rebounds in 25 minutes in the Pacers' 
88-86 victory that tied the series. 
</P>
<P>
	In leading New York to victory in Game 1, Ewing had 16 points  
and 10 rebounds in 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury is yet another blow to Ewing's quest for a  
championship. He's been to the NBA Finals just once, when the 
Knicks lost to Houston in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating to work so hard and be so close to something  
I've dreamed about for so many years,'' Ewing said. ``To not be 
able to be on the floor to help my teammates is very frustrating 
and disappointing. But if my Achilles ruptures completely, it would 
end my career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His absence now makes New York's job even more difficult against  
favored Indiana. The Knicks are the first eighth-seeded team to 
make the conference finals, and Ewing was a big reason why, despite 
his injuries. Chris Dudley will take Ewing's spot at center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patrick wants to play but the injury prevents that from being  
a possibility,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``After all that he has 
been through this year, playing injured and doing what he could do 
to help his team achieve the goal of competing for a championship, 
I feel very badly for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 14-year veteran has been slowed all season by his sore  
Achilles' tendon, and also has struggled with knees that need to be 
packed in ice after every game. He was out for most of last season 
with a broken wrist but came back in the second round of the 
playoffs, when New York lost to the Pacers in five games. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing averaged 17.3 points and 9.9 rebounds during 38  
regular-season games this year, missing 12 games because of his 
sore Achilles' tendon. During the playoffs, which included 
victories over Miami and Atlanta, he averaged 13.1 points and 8.7 
rebounds a game.

<HEADLINE> Breast Cancer Patients Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Women having difficulty coping with breast cancer are more  
likely to try alternative treatments -- a potential tip to doctors 
that some patients may need special help, researchers reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical  
School in Boston found that while these women still chose surgery 
and other standard treatments in addition to alternative therapy, 
they complained of more physical and emotional problems than other 
women studied. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is an efficient opportunity for busy doctors to  
focus on women who might be in trouble,'' said Dr. Harold Burstein, 
a co-author of the study published in today's New England Journal 
of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers surveyed patients diagnosed with early-stage  
breast cancer from 1993 to 1995. They found that women who started 
using alternative therapies after breast surgery fared considerably 
worse, at least initially, than those who never used alternative 
medicine or women who were using it before surgery. The three 
groups reported similar mental and physical health the month before 
their diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the new users of alternative therapy, Burstein said,  
were more likely to be depressed. They reported less sexual 
satisfaction, greater fear their cancer would recur and a greater 
number of, and more severe, physical symptoms, mostly from the 
chemotherapy and radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	The alternatives the women tried included herbal medicine,  
mega-vitamins, self-help groups and relaxation techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	After a year, all women showed improved mental and physical  
health, but some new users of alternative therapy had more problems 
than the others. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is conceivable that the alternative therapies caused the  
distress,'' said Dr. Jane Weeks, a co-author and a professor of 
medicine at Harvard. But ``it it is my gut feeling that women who 
were choosing alternative medicine were turning to it in an attempt 
to get some relief from the psychosocial distress they were 
having.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 480 Massachusetts women surveyed by questionnaire or  
telephone interview, more than 28 percent reported starting 
alternative medicine after their surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. William Gradishar, director of breast medical oncology at  
Northwestern University in Chicago, said that while the study 
highlights the need for patients and doctors to communicate better, 
he doesn't agree that use of alternative medicine is the best sign 
of depression. 
</P>
<P>
	``A few well-placed questions can identify the patient who's  
really having trouble,'' Gradishar said.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Roundup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the  
United States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	June 1  
</P>
<P>
	Houston Chronicle, on interstate abortions:  
</P>
<P>
	Conservative Washington lawmakers are proposing to make it a  
crime to take a minor across state lines to have an abortion if 
laws in the girl's home state require that her parents must be 
notified before she may surgically end her pregnancy. The plan 
professedly is a bill to protect parental rights, but it really is 
just another attack on women's constitutional right to control 
their reproductivity. 
</P>
<P>
	If passed, the impact of this federal proposal would be felt in  
Texas. That is because the Legislature passed a bill changing Texas 
law to require doctors to notify parents before a minor daughter 
may have an abortion. That law will require girls who fear violence 
from their parents to disclose the most private details of their 
lives to a judge -- many of whose opposition to abortion is an open 
secret -- in order to bypass the notification requirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas lawmakers did not recognize the wisdom of at least  
allowing notification of some other adult relative, which is 
important for the many teen-agers in this state who live in 
households with relatives who do not have formal guardianship. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Teen-agers should not have sex. The fact is, however, that many  
do. It stands to reason that most girls who become pregnant go to 
their parents for help. Even those who are reluctant should be 
encouraged to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	But Congress should not throw up still more obstacles before  
those girls who want to end their pregnancies and have very valid 
reasons for not informing their parents of their decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor should lawmakers be working to turn caring relatives into  
criminals. 

</P>
<P>
	May 27  
</P>
<P>
	The San Diego Union Tribune, on China and theft of U.S. nuclear  
secrets: 
</P>
<P>
	China has stolen classified design information on every  
thermonuclear warhead currently deployed in the U.S. ballistic 
missile arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	The thefts of these nuclear secrets from our national weapons  
laboratories have enabled China to design, develop and successfully 
test modern strategic nuclear weapons sooner than otherwise would 
have been possible. ... And, oh yes, China has up to two dozen 
long-range missiles aimed at the United States, despite agreeing in 
1998 that the two countries would no longer target ICBMs at each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	These are but a few of the choice revelations included in the  
unclassified version of a 700-page, bipartisan report released (May 
26) by a House select committee chaired by Rep. Christopher Cox, 
R-Calif. .... 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration agreed with the Cox report's findings  
to a point. ... 
</P>
<P>
	But the administration absolutely refuses to acknowledge that  
China stole any nuclear secrets or obtained any militarily useful 
technology during President Clinton's watch. The Cox report's 
findings contradict this claim. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most egregious example was the refusal of Attorney  
General Janet Reno in 1997 to approve a warrant request by the FBI 
to monitor the phones and computer of a suspected spy at the 
national lab in Los Alamos, N.M. Because of the attorney general's 
refusal, not until last month did government authorities finally 
get around to searching the suspected spy's computer. What they 
found was that he had managed to steal more than 1,000 top-secret 
files of computer codes on the U.S. military's nuclear weapons. ... 
The officials whose neglectfulness, incompetence or whatever 
allowed this to happen ought to be held fully accountable.

	Journal Star, Peoria, Ill., on Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	As Memorial Days go, this is surely a bizarre one.  
</P>
<P>
	The United States is engaging in a war the American Legion  
opposes, Congress will finance but does not support, and the 
president endorses but will not, with fullness of purpose, inhale. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the many criticisms of the bombing campaign is that in its  
eagerness to avoid digging its own soldiers' graves, the United 
States is killing the very civilians whose tragic plight sucked us 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	The muscle-flexing that was supposed to ensure the future of  
NATO is at increasing daily risk of fracturing the alliance. ... 
</P>
<P>
	NATO is bolstering the number of soldiers waiting nearby to be  
called into Kosovo should there be a peace agreement. Should there 
not be, those soldiers could be an invasion vanguard. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said the other day that this  
is the ``worst-managed American campaign since the Spanish-American 
War.'' While most Americans' familiarity with the ins and outs of 
that century-ago conflict is limited, it is obvious that this one 
has been ill-planned and ill-conducted. ... 
</P>
<P>
	And so on this Memorial Day, we are at a crossroads. If we  
cannot soon reach some tolerable peace, then the odds of a ground 
war go up sharply. ...

	St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times, on military base closings:  
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of Defense William Cohen, the Joint Chiefs of Staff  
and the secretaries of the Air Force, Navy and Army pleaded with 
Congress last week to allow two more rounds of base closings in 
2001 and 2005. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Military officials have called the closings ``absolutely  
necessary.'' ... Unfortunately, the Senate rejected, on a 60-40 
vote, a measure that would have authorized a new round of base 
closings in 2001 as part of a $288.8 billion defense spending bill 
for the next fiscal year. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Closings favored by the Pentagon would save an estimated $20  
billion and generate $3.6 billion annually by eliminating the 
overhead costs of running the bases. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Congress know the devastating effect a base closing  
can have on a community. Still, evidence exists that many 
communities have recovered and even flourished when nearby bases 
were converted to non-military use. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The military leaders charged with the responsibility of  
defending the country are united in their support for an objective 
process of base closings. It makes you wonder what exactly most 
senators are trying to defend.

	Seattle Post-Intelligencer, on fines for vitamin makers:  
</P>
<P>
	The best thing about the Justice Department's unmasking of the  
criminal cartel run by the world's leading makers of vitamins is 
that the huge fines they'll pay are just the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	Their punishment also will include the opportunity to answer in  
court to class-action suits by consumers and corporate customers 
who were fleeced by this outrageous scheme to fix prices and divvy 
up territory. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Milk, bread, pasta, orange juice, cereal, butter and a host of  
other household food staples contained the overpriced vitamin 
supplements. Vitamins sold in pill form also were part of the 
conspiracy to defraud the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd., a Swiss pharmaceutical firm, agreed to  
pay $500 million in fines, the largest ever imposed by the Justice 
Department. BASF A.G. of Germany will pay $225 million. A number of 
smaller companies participating in the conspiracy are still being 
investigated. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vitamin cartel was as bad as they get,'' said one Justice  
Department official. Still, the agency settled for less than it was 
entitled to. It could have socked Hoffmann-LaRoche $1.3 billion for 
its share of the profiteering on $53 billion worth of vitamins. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps in showing restraint, the Justice Department was just  
saving some of these corporations' ill-gotten money to be awarded 
to the rest of us victimized vitamin consumers.

	Herald-Journal, Spartanburg, S.C., on limiting powers of U.S.  
Customs: 
</P>
<P>
	Congress needs to pass a proposed bill that would restore the  
rights of citizens dealing with the U.S. Customs Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would give citizens returning to the country access to  
an attorney within 24 hours of being detained by the Customs 
Service. It would require the service to get the permission of a 
magistrate before holding a citizen more than 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is necessary because of leeway the courts have given  
the Customs Service in dealing with international travelers. The 
service has special powers to hold and search travelers -- powers 
that are subject to abuse.

	The (Portland) Oregonian, on livestock protection:  
</P>
<P>
	If Congress is looking for a quick kill of a federal activity  
that has wasted taxpayer dollars for the past 58 years, it need 
look no further than the U.S. Agriculture Department's predator 
control program. 
</P>
<P>
	Begun in 1931, this program is politely called Wildlife  
Services. But it provides no services to wildlife unless one 
believes that the indiscriminate slaughter of animals, ranging from 
coyotes to foxes, bobcats to bears, and badgers to family pets, 
somehow serves to protect livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	The facts are that the program hasn't worked very well, other  
than to spare ranchers the cost of protecting their own livestock 
from predator damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., and Rep. Charles Bass, R-N.H., are  
sponsoring an amendment to the bill that would take away $7 million 
of the money Wildlife Services spends killing these predators. ... 
</P>
<P>
	To be fair, there are times when killing predators may be  
necessary to protect livestock or publich health and safety. But 
when it's necessary, there are other predator-control methods that 
may work better, such as the use of guard dogs or fencing. 
</P>
<P>
	The House should support the DeFazio-Bass amendment in the  
spirit that killing coyotes with taxpayer dollars doesn't really 
protect anything but the wallets of ranchers.

	Herald Star, Steubenville, Ohio, on presidential pay raise:  
</P>
<P>
	Does the person who lives in the best public housing complex in  
the country deserve a pay raise? 
</P>
<P>
	A House subcommittee on Monday was told by a panel of former  
presidential advisers that the president's pay should be increased 
from the current $200,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, courtesy of the people, has a home for four or  
eight years, a complete staff and transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has always reaped the rewards of office after  
leaving the White House. Pay from one public speaking engagement 
can garner as much as what one average American earns in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be difficult to convince the American people the  
president deserves such a pay raise, especially after the escapades 
that went on in the White House during the current administration.

	The Daily Telegraph, London, on IRA victims:  
</P>
<P>
	Jean McConville cushioned the head of a dying British soldier.  
Because of this warmhearted gesture, she was cold-bloodedly 
murdered. The IRA abducted her and killed her. The republicans 
refused even to tell the family where Mrs. McConville's body was 
buried. Later, they hinted that it had been hidden under a Belfast 
housing estate. Still later, they indicated that it had been 
concealed in the Irish Republic, beneath a car park built on 
reclaimed sand dunes. Last night, after a second day of digging by 
the Irish police, no body had been found. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McConville is one of the ``disappeared'' -- those whose  
bodies were dumped, frequently after torture, by the republicans. 
Last Friday, the remains of Eamon Molloy, who was shot in 1975, 
were found in a coffin. Excavations are taking place at five other 
sites in the Irish Republic. The story of the disappeared has 
helped remind people, both in the UK and Ireland, of quite how evil 
Sinn Fein/IRA has been. And the failure to find Mrs. McConville's 
body, or others, has fixed attention to its wickedness. There has 
been a wave of protest and horror.

	The Daily Mail, London, on genetically modified foods:  
</P>
<P>
	Rarely has a royal intervention in a national debate achieved  
such a telling effect. Yesterday's article by Prince Charles in the 
Mail, raising his concerns over GM (genetically modified) foods and 
crops, has not only aroused intense public interest but seems to 
have exposed tensions within the government itself. 
</P>
<P>
	While Environment Minister Michael Meacher appears almost to  
welcome Charles' comments, the response elsewhere is less than 
enthusiastic. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed the official attitude was summed up by the Prime Minister  
last week, when he accused the media of whipping up `hysteria' over 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	That is as may be, though this paper would strongly dispute the  
claim. But what is beyond doubt is that Charles' restrained and 
sober questions are anything but hysterical. Rather than attacking 
the media, the government would be better advised to answer the 
pertinent questions he posed.

	We must fear the worst and dread that NATO leaders, badly

unacceptable tactic used in vain against Baghdad: to torment a 
population in order to provoke a revolt against its leader. The 
result is nothing less than guaranteed. Special envoys in the 
capital of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia confirm this: the 
bombardments against, for example, electric transformer plants turn 
the population against NATO, not against Slobodan Milosevic. These 
bombardments are not only immoral, they are unproductive. They 
remain indicative of an absurd strategic choice, even for those who 
support the use of force against Mr Milosevic.

	The Australian, on South Africa election:  
</P>
<P>
	South Africa's liberation from the shackles of apartheid and the  
election of Nelson Mandela as its first black president in 1994 
were momentous events ... of historic importance for South Africa 
and for the rest of the world. Yet the second, apparently more 
prosaic national multiracial elections are just as significant in 
South Africa's progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Change of government anywhere can be risky but South Africa  
faces an extraordinarily delicate period in its development. Most 
South Africans still live in poverty, waiting for basic material 
living conditions that they believe are theirs by right and which 
they had hoped the first ANC government would deliver. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela's government was one of transition and reconciliation.  
The need to build economic and social stability, while reinforcing 
political integrity and transparency, is just as crucial but the 
task requires a government and leader prepared to forge their own 
path. If reports that almost 12 million dollars is being set aside 
for the inauguration of the new president are true, it would be an 
inauspicious beginning. Thabo Mbeki may want to step out of 
Mandela's shadow but that does not justify a spree that exaggerates 
the divide between a privileged few and the impoverished masses.

<P>

</P>
<P>
	The Nation, Bangkok, Thailand, on South African elections:  
</P>
<P>
	As South Africa goes to the polls, there is little of the sense  
of historic change that accompanied the country's first all-race 
elections five years ago. Indeed, there is little sense of change 
whatsoever. Apart from the passing of power from black liberation 
hero Nelson Mandela to his deputy, Thabo Mbeki, the only issue the 
elections appear set to resolve is whether the African National 
Congress will win a two-thirds majority and, along with that, the 
power to change the constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for the sake of South Africa's political development, it  
would probably be best if the party fails in this goal. Among 
Mandela's greatest achievements in power were to preside over the 
introduction of a liberal constitution and to oversee the 
installation of a genuine democracy in a continent where 
dictatorships are the rule. All that would be at risk if the ANC 
was to take near-absolute control. ...

up. 
</P>
<P>
	Such an outrageous trial raises serious questions on the new  
world order that both NATO and the United Nations say they are 
trying to create. Not only is Turkey a NATO member, but it is also 
seeking the EU membership. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Europe is based on certain specific principles: it rejects  
the death penalty and supports public trials.

</P>
<P>
	In the so-called ``just war'' on Yugoslavia, NATO is using

</P>
<P>
	An alliance and a union that want to lead the new world order

	Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo, on international relations on the Korean

</P>
<P>
	There appear to be some signs of incipient change in  
international relations on the Korean Peninsula. The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), which was isolated in the 
international scene, has shown a flexible attitude toward the 
United States. Pyongyang has also started to mend its relations 
with China, at the highest level, which have been frozen for many 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Yong Nam, North Korea's Chairman of the Standing Committee  
of the Supreme People's Assembly and second in command after Kim 
Jong Il, will make an official visit to China on Thursday.... 
</P>
<P>
	On the whole, steps being taken on the Korean Peninsula can be  
seen as moving toward an easing tentions there. Greater dialogue 
and exchanges between North Korea and other countries are something 
to be welcomed. 
</P>
<P>
	The series of moves in recent weeks will be quite meaningful if  
they prompt North Korea to free itself from international isolation 
and start dialogue with other countries in Northeast Asia. Japan 
must be sensitive to changes in the situation on the Korean 
Peninsula.

	Neue Zuercher Zeitung, Zurich, Switzerland, on inauguration of  
Nigeria's first civilian president for 15 years: 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria's military ruler, Abdulsalami Abubakar, kept his word.  
As he announced a year ago, he turned over the leadership of the 
country May 29 to a successor elected by the people. ... 
</P>
<P>
	It is only the second time that a Nigerian military government  
has actually fulfilled a promise to return to barracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Abubakar was following the example of his successor -- former  
general (Olusegun) Obasanjo, who in 1979 handed over power to the 
civilian Shehu Shagari. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo finds himself in a situation which in many ways  
resembles that of Shagari. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo's arrival at the presidential palace in Abuja has  
raised great hopes of an economic and moral new beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Shagari, the new president promises to stamp out corruption  
and reestablish trust in government and administration. ... 
</P>
<P>
	In his choice of ministers and close advisers, it will soon be  
seen how serious Obasanjo is in his promise of transparent 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	It is one thing to present oneself as a servant of the state and  
the general good, but another to fend off the demands of party 
friends and discredited old politicians.

<HEADLINE> Steel Producers Seek More Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Domestic steel producers hurt by low-priced  
imports are pressing ahead with new requests for punitive tariffs 
despite recent reductions in shipments from Japan and other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry filed its latest complaints Wednesday, asking the  
federal government to impose tariffs on a high-grade product called 
cold-rolled, flat carbon steel. 
</P>
<P>
	One steel executive said cases targeting steel rail and tin also  
are in the works as part of the industry's assault on imports, 
which reached record levels last year. U.S. producers blame the 
imports for thousands of layoffs nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many cases have been brought, and I believe more will be  
brought,'' said Curtis H. Barnette, chairman and chief executive of 
Bethlehem Steel Corp. ``It's accurate to say there are injurious 
imports in other product areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cold-rolled complaints came despite reductions in imports by  
roughly 40 percent since November. U.S. producers say foreign 
countries continue to flaunt U.S. trade laws that prohibit unfair 
pricing practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Countries that ignore our laws and international agreements  
should have learned by now we will use every means available to 
stop them,'' said Richard K. Riederer, president and chief 
executive of Weirton Steel Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Bethlehem Steel, Weirton Steel and six other companies joined  
the United Steelworkers of America in accusing a dozen countries, 
including Japan and Russia, of unfair pricing practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases represent the third major round of trade complains in  
the wake of the Asian economic crisis, which reduced demand for 
steel abroad and led foreign producers to find an outlet in a 
healthy U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	A Japanese steel executive, Hidenori Tazawa of NKK America Inc.,  
said the latest complaint ``has absolutely no economic or factual 
basis ... (and) only indicates the lengths to which U.S. steel 
mills are willing to go to stifle legitimate domestic and 
international competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The filings with the Commerce Department and the U.S.  
International Trade Commission seek steel tariffs to effectively 
raise prices of foreign shipments. The targeted countries are 
Argentina, Brazil, China, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, South Africa, 
Slovakia, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry accused the 12 countries of selling goods in  
the United States below production costs or home-market prices. 
Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand and Venezuela also were charged with 
subsidizing their producers to artificially lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department already has ruled that Japan illegally  
sold the industry's leading product, hot-rolled carbon steel, at 
unfair prices. The U.S. International Trade Commission is to 
determine next week whether the pricing practices warrant tariffs. 
Similar cases are pending against Russia and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest product targeted, cold-rolled flat carbon steel, is  
pressed from hot-rolled sheets into a thinner, stronger material 
that commands a higher price. Typical applications include washing 
machines, refrigerators and some internal auto parts. 
</P>
<P>
	The other companies filing the cold-rolled complaints are Gulf  
States Steel, Ispat Inland Inc., LTV Steel Co. Inc, National Steel 
Corp., Steel Dynamics Inc. and U.S. Steel Group.

<HEADLINE> Charismatic Weathers Stormy Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Charismatic proved a good traveler on a stormy  
trip Wednesday from Louisville to Belmont Park, where the colt will 
try to become a Triple Crown champion by winning the Belmont 
Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the flight was Silverbulletday, who will be making her  
debut against males in quest of a 12th victory in 13 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had bad weather and were delayed leaving Louisville -- high  
storms and crackling lightning,'' said D. Wayne Lukas, 
Charismatic's trainer, who was on the plane. ``All the horses 
traveled just great except Silverbulletday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas looked at Bob Baffert, the filly's trainer, who arrived in  
New York on Tuesday night. He then laughed and said, ``She was 
reluctant to get on. She protested every step of the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strapping chestnut colt and the bay filly are a two-horse  
story in a 12-horse race. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, who ran for a $62,500 claiming tag Feb. 11, will be  
trying to become the 12th horse to sweep the Kentucky Derby, 
Preakness and Belmont Stakes and the first since Affirmed in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Should he collect first-place money of $600,000 from a $1  
million purse and also earn a Visa-sponsored $5 million bonus to 
any horse winning all three races, Lukas would become the first 
trainer to top $200 million in earnings. The late Charlie 
Whittingham is second with about $110 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic is owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis, owners of the  
Baffert-trained Silver Charm. Silver Charm failed to win the Triple 
Crown when he finished second in the 1997 Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert also failed to win the Triple Crown last year when Real  
Quiet, owned by Mike Pegram, Silverbulletday's owner, was beaten a 
nose by Victory Gallop. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis has no problem with Baffert trying to spoil his colt's  
Triple Crown bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've said to all of you over the past two or three weeks,  
bring them on, bring them all on,'' he said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 25 Belmonts in which the Triple Crown was at stake,  
Saturday's field is the second largest. Thirteen started in 1971 
when Canonero II finished fourth. The biggest field for a 
successful Triple Crown was eight when Seattle Slew won in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday will be only the 21st filly in 131 Belmonts. The  
winners were Ruthless in the first Belmont in 1867 and Tanya in 
1905. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to find out if she fits,'' Baffert said. ``I think  
she fits. A mile and a half -- I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She will be ridden by Jerry Bailey because Gary Stevens, her  
regular jockey, is riding in England. 
</P>
<P>
	``The filly will add a great deal of spice,'' Lukas said. ``Half  
the world is women. She'll have a built-in rooting second that 
don't ever read the (Racing) Form.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday is the 4-1 early third choice behind Charismatic  
(2-1) and Menifee (7-2). Charismatic was 31-1 in the Derby and 8-1 
in the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee, runner-up in the Derby and Preakness, is trained by  
Elliott Walden. Walden is also the trainer of Victory Gallop, who 
preceded his Belmont victory with seconds in the first two races. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday will start from the No. 3 post, with  
Charismatic, ridden by Chris Antley, going from No. 4. Menifee, 
ridden by Pat Day, will start from the No. 10 post. 
</P>
<P>
	Post-position is not that important in the Belmont. Because of  
the distance of the race and the track's sweeping turns, there is 
time to sort things out. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than Silverbulletday, Best of Luck (6-1), the Peter Pan  
winner, is the shortest-priced of five 3-year-olds making their 
debuts in Triple Crown competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The other four are Vision and Verse, Prime Directive and Pineaff  
-- 1-2-3 in the Illinois Derby -- and Teletable, whose four career 
starts all have been in maiden races. Teletable's only win came in 
his last start Feb. 15 at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Back for another crack at Charismatic are the Nick Zito-trained  
pair of Stephen Got Even and Adonis, Lemon Drop Kid and Patience 
Game. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Got Even finished 14th in the 1 1/4-mile Derby after a  
rough trip, then improved to fourth in the 1 3-16-mile Preakness. 
Adonis, 17th in Derby, also after traffic problems, finished sixth 
in the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid finished ninth in the Derby, skipped the  
Preakness and finished third in the Peter Pan. Patience Game won 
the Derby Trial, skipped the Derby and finished fifth in the 
Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belmont held a traditional blind draw. Had Charismatic drawn  
No. 4 in the Derby or Preakness, Lukas would have been fourth in 
the selection order and could have chosen any remaining 
post-positions.

<HEADLINE> The Breaks Eventually Even Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Two of the worst calls in the history of televised sports belong  
to baseball. Combined, they make the best possible argument for 
keeping instant replay as far from the game as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	There wouldn't even be a debate except that on Monday veteran  
umpire Frank Pulli did something unseen in the five decades since 
somebody first shrunk the national pastime to the size of a picture 
tube. He wandered over to a TV camera and asked to have a second 
look. 
</P>
<P>
	What Pulli did was watch a fifth-inning fly ball hit by  
Florida's Cliff Floyd -- over and over. It touched off a sequence as 
confusing as it was comical. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd claimed his drive bounced off the facade behind the  
left-field scoreboard in Miami for a homer. Second-base ump Greg 
Gibson said it hit the scoreboard for a double. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins argued, the umpires conferred and Pulli, the crew  
chief, changed the ruling. Home run. Then the Cardinals protested, 
Pulli consulted a TV camera near the Marlins dugout, and switched 
the call again. Double. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the umpire's boss struck back.  
</P>
<P>
	``Use of the video replay is not an acceptable practice. Part of  
the beauty of baseball is that it is imperfect,'' NL president Len 
Coleman said. ``Players make errors. Managers are constantly 
second-guessed. But the game is played and determined by two teams 
between the white lines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not always -- as the following two examples prove:  
</P>
<P>
	Hands-down winner of the worst call ever is umpire Don  
Denkinger. With St. Louis leading 1-0 in the ninth inning of Game 6 
of the 1985 World Series, Denkinger ruled Kansas City's Jorge Orta 
beat out a grounder to first -- though replays clearly showed 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	The call helped Kansas City win that game to tie the Series 3-3.  
The Royals won Game 7 when Denkinger, working behind the plate, 
repeatedly got into it with Cards manager Whitey Herzog and pitcher 
Joaquin Andujar and wound up ejecting both. 
</P>
<P>
	The Game 6 call was so awful that after a while, Denkinger took  
a perverse pride in having made it. He didn't just own up to the 
mistake, he had a framed print displayed prominently in his home. 
By the time he retired last fall, Denkinger sounded wistful -- if 
somewhat deluded -- in saying few people even remembered it any 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still constantly reminded by some fans from St. Louis,''  
he said. ``But time has a great way of healing. Basically, it is 
pretty well forgotten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next worst call ever televised was made by umpire Rich  
Garcia in Game 1 of the 1996 AL championship. With the Orioles 
leading 4-3 in the bottom of the eighth, New York's Derek Jeter hit 
a fly ball to the right-field wall. Baltimore outfielder Tony 
Tarasco parked underneath the ball and prepared to make the catch. 
But a 12-year-old Yankee fan named Jeff Maier reached over the 
fence with his own baseball glove and deflected it into the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	Though replays would later prove him wrong, too, Garcia ruled no  
interference and declared Jeter's fly a game-tying home run. The 
Yankees won 5-4 in 11 innings, and went on to win the ALCS and 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm starting to understand what it did,'' Jeff said. ``It  
struck me this morning when I woke up. Wow! I may have really 
helped the Yankees out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What these two episodes prove beyond a doubt is that life isn't  
fair. 
</P>
<P>
	It's easy to make more neutral arguments against instant replay  
-- especially in baseball. NL president Coleman said it eloquently: 
Errors by everybody involved are part of the folklore of the game. 
On top of that, there is not a decisive camera angle on every play; 
the game is too long as it is; and its very foundation -- calling 
balls and strikes -- is built on one person making sound judgments. 
</P>
<P>
	But the real threat to the game is the notion that complaining  
loud or long enough, or looking at the replay enough times, is the 
way to guarantee justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Everybody who saw the Game 6 call -- including Denkinger -- knew  
it was wrong a few seconds after it happened. The Cardinals -- 
especially Herzog and Andujar -- couldn't get over it. It wound up 
costing them the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	What they didn't learn is the lesson people who get bad calls  
outside the white lines repeat over and over: The breaks even out. 
Eventually. 
</P>
<P>
	And sometimes, they actually do. Forgotten in all the uproar  
over Maier's impetuous stab at the baseball was what happened just 
a few weeks earlier. Roberto Alomar, then playing for Baltimore, 
had spit on an ump and then made a mockery of baseball's 
ineffective justice system by clinching both a wild-card spot and 
the divisional series for the Orioles with clutch hits in games he 
shouldn't have been allowed to play.

	9 Die in Ark. Plane Crash Landing  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A coroner has confirmed that nine  
people were killed when an American Airlines jetliner skidded off a 
runway while landing during a storm last night. The deaths are the 
first on a major U.S. airline in nearly 1 1/2 years. The dead were not 
immediately identified, except for Flight 1420's pilot, Capt. 
Richard Buschmann, the airline's chief pilot in Chicago. The jet 
was headed to Arkansas from Dallas and crashed amid rough weather 
at the Little Rock airport just before midnight. More than 80 
others on board were treated for injuries at hospitals. There were 
also about 50 others who didn't require treatment.

	US Seeks More Normal Trade With China  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to extend normal trade  
relations with China for another year, White House officials said 
today, despite opposition from Congress. The annual recommendation 
for ``most-favored nation'' status comes at a time when allegations 
that China stole sensitive nuclear secrets from U.S. research 
facilities and NATO's mistaken bombing of the Chinese Embassy in 
Belgrade have strained U.S. relations with Beijing. But aides say 
Clinton is convinced that continued engagement with China is key to 
improving relations.

	Clinton Ups Kosovo Commitment  
</P>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- President Clinton has raised the  
U.S. commitment to a Kosovo peacekeeping force from 4,000 to 7,000 
troops today, saying: ``We have a moral responsibility to oppose 
crimes against humanity.'' NATO has proposed an international force 
of some 50,000 troops for Kosovo peacekeeping. Meanwhile, Russian 
and European envoys flew to Yugoslavia's capital for talks with 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic today after resolving many 
major differences of a Kosovo peace plan. The talks with Milosevic 
began early this evening.

	Killing Halts Paris Transportation  
</P>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- A strike by transport workers angry about the  
killing of a co-worker paralyzed public transportation in Paris and 
its suburbs today. The deadly attack against Eric Douet was only 
the latest in a rising number of assaults against French transport 
workers. Douet was beaten to death by a peddler he had confronted. 
The government responded to the rising violence by deploying elite 
police on trains and buses, but the transport union said the 
measures weren't enough. Meanwhile, thousands of French commuters 
walked through the muggy weather to work.

	World Bank Estimates 200M New Poor  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The World Bank in its annual update on global  
poverty estimates there are millions of ``newly poor'' people, and 
recommends urgent changes in financial rescue programs. The bank 
said programs, including unemployment insurance and subsidized 
school fees, are needed to avoid and deal with financial crises. 
The bank responded to data showing poverty rising again in India, 
continuing to go up in Africa and sharply worsening across Eastern 
Europe and Central Asia. The bank said the number of people 
classified as living in abject poverty rose 200 million in 1993 to 
1.5 billion.

	Iraq Faces Food 'Catastrophe'  
</P>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq is enduring its worst drought in  
nearly 100 years and will soon face a food ``catastrophe'' if new 
aid funds are not immediately found, U.N. and Iraqi officials said 
today. According to figures released yesterday by the U.N., Iraq 
has lost about 70 percent of its crops in the country's 
breadbasket. An Iraqi agriculture official said water levels across 
Iraq were only 43 percent of normal.

Dow industrials were down 25.65 points at 10,570.61. Decliners on

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Tampa Bay Devil Rays made Josh Hamilton  
today the first high school player to go No. 1 in the baseball 
draft since Alex Rodriguez went to Seattle in 1993. Hamilton, an 
outfielder at Athens Drive High in North Carolina, hit .514 with 13 
homers and 36 RBIs this season. Five of the first six players taken 
in the draft are high schoolers. Pitcher Josh Beckett, from Spring 
High in Texas, went second to Florida.

<HEADLINE> Mazda Sets New Minivan Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Mazda Motor Corp. will price its redesigned 2000  
MPV -- its first new minivan in a decade -- at just under $20,000 for 
the base model. 
</P>
<P>
	List prices will range from $19,995 for the base DX model to  
$25,550 for the luxury ES model. Those prices make the imported MPV 
competitive with minivans offered by domestic and foreign 
automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The new MPV is Mazda's bid to re-establish itself in the  
increasingly competitive minivan market. Richard Beattie, president 
and chief executive of Mazda's North American operations, has said 
that Mazda expects to triple MPV sales to between 50,000 and 60,000 
units a year after it goes on sale in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The MPV, which debuted at this year's New York auto show,  
features an unusual rear seat that folds flat into the floor or 
quickly flips backward to make a seat for tailgate parties. The 
prices were announced late Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Facing Severe Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq is enduring its worst drought in  
nearly 100 years and will soon face a food ``catastrophe'' if new 
aid funds are not immediately found, U.N. and Iraqi officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	According to figures released Tuesday by the U.N. Food and  
Agriculture Organization, Iraq has lost about 70 percent of its 
crops in the country's breadbasket. 
</P>
<P>
	``The low rainfall and higher temperatures have had a disastrous  
effect on crops and livestock in Iraq,'' Hans von Sponeck, Iraq's 
U.N. humanitarian coordinator, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	More alarming, according to von Sponeck, is the fact that 90  
percent of the wheat and barley fields in these areas ``have failed 
to germinate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A catastrophe,'' he declared.  
</P>
<P>
	Neither von Sponeck nor the FAO's Iraq representative, Amir  
Khalil, offered exact figures on this year's yields. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a U.N. report released in Baghdad said Iraq was  
facing grain harvests of only a third of what they were last year, 
when government granaries collected 1.2 million tons of wheat and 
859,000 tons of barley. 
</P>
<P>
	But Khalil said new government figures showed that the barley  
harvest will actually be at least 90 percent below last year's 
yields. The prospect for wheat is also bleak, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both officials expressed fears about whether the government will  
be able to sustain its food rationing system, upon which millions 
of Iraqis depend for sustenance. 
</P>
<P>
	Von Sponeck will travel to New York next week to ask the U.N.  
Security Council for immediate additional funding to help meet 
Iraq's food needs. 
</P>
<P>
	He said relief aid pouring into Iraq under the oil program,  
which allows oil exports of $5.2 billion every six months, is 
``inadequate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Iraqi agriculture official Abdulsattar Salaman said water  
levels across Iraq were only 43 percent of normal. Khalil said the 
drought was the severest Iraq has had since it began keeping 
records in 1903. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is going to affect all aspects of life in Iraq,'' he said.  
``There is no crop even for grazing. There is no germination. 
Livestock are emigrating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Khalil said more than 400,000 Iraqi shepherds and Bedouin have  
left the parched areas in the center and south of the country and 
moved to Kurdish-rebel controlled land in the north in search of 
pasture and water. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the drought has also adversely affected the  
livestock and poultry production in the mountainous Kurdish areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations in Baghdad has formed a drought committee to  
help Iraq deal with the drought crisis.

<HEADLINE> Jones Attys. Decry Clinton Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Paula Jones' lawyers contend that  
President Clinton's proposal for what he should pay to resolve the 
civil contempt citation against him is inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	In documents filed Tuesday, John W. Whitehead and the Rutherford  
Institute said the sanctions proposed by Clinton ``would do 
precious little to redress'' his misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright found Clinton in  
contempt in April for giving intentionally false testimony about 
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his January 1998 
deposition in Mrs. Jones' sexual harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge then ordered Clinton to pay Mrs. Jones' lawyers any  
``reasonable'' expenses they incurred as a result of his false 
testimony. The lawyers have asked the court to order Clinton to pay 
almost $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyers on May 21 proposed that the president pay  
$33,737 to the court and other attorneys for Mrs. Jones, and 
nothing to Whitehead and the Rutherford Institute, a conservative 
legal group. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's attorneys said the request from Mrs. Jones' side was  
unreasonable and ``bears no relationship to the actions that gave 
rise'' to the contempt order. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton attorney Robert Bennett also argued that the institute  
provided no legal services to Mrs. Jones, performing only 
fund-raising and public-relations tasks. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones' attorneys contended in Tuesday's filing that the  
institute provided services that her other attorneys could not 
handle alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Any payment would be in addition to the $850,000 Clinton has  
already paid Mrs. Jones to settle the sexual harassment case 
without admitting wrongdoing. Clinton denies any wrongdoing and has 
said he settled the case simply to bring an end to a public crisis.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Romance held its own against the Force.  
</P>
<P>
	Julia Roberts' new romantic comedy ``Notting Hill'' opened with  
a strong $27.7 million against the powerhouse ``Star Wars'' 
prequel, which had a record-setting Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' broke the $200  
million mark over the weekend, doing in 13 days what took 
``Independence Day'' 21 days in 1996. The film grossed $66.9 
million over the four-day weekend, bringing its cumulative take to 
$207.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	While second-place ``Notting Hill'' enjoyed big business as a  
romantic alternative, ``The Thirteenth Floor'' opened with a 
disappointing $4.3 million in fifth and ``The Love Letter'' dropped 
59 percent to collect just $1.4 million in its second week.

<HEADLINE> Missy Elliot Talks To Spin Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Missy ``Misdemeanor'' Elliott is a devout  
Baptist who goes to church, but her raps often include raunchy 
behavior and foul language. The rapper/producer is feeling a little 
conflicted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I go through battles where I'm like, `Dag, I'm still cussing  
on albums, and I don't wanna cuss no more,''' she said in July's 
Spin magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to get it together. I stopped doing a lot of things  
-- I won't drink and I don't smoke. But I don't want people to be 
like, `Okay, now she's Reverend Elliott.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nicklaus Will Pass Up British Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) -- Jack Nicklaus, who missed the Masters for  
the first time in 40 years because of hip replacement surgery, will 
skip the British Open for the second year in a row so as not to 
jeopardize his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus' streak of majors ended at 154 last year when he sat  
out the British Open because of hip problems. He underwent surgery 
in January and returns to the PGA Tour this week in his Memorial 
Tournament here. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus said Tuesday that his schedule will prevent him from  
playing in the British Open on July 15-18 in Carnoustie, Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus is committed to playing in the U.S. Senior Open and the  
Senior Players Championship the two weeks before the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would be three weeks in a row,'' he said of the British  
Open. ``That's just more than I can play. I said that's just crazy 
to even think about. Two weeks in a row is going to be tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, 59, said he plans to play in all four majors in 2000.  
</P>
<P>
	``Whether that will be the end of my majors or not, we'll see. I  
hope not,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lawsuit Filed Against Gunmakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Camden County has joined the list of  
governments suing the gun industry to recover costs stemming from 
handgun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit does not specify a damage amount, but officials said  
Wednesday that the county has spent millions cleaning up the damage 
wrought by firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	The county, the first local government to file such a suit in  
the state, wants to recoup part of the cost of running offices for 
the prosecutor, sheriff and medical examiner, and the juvenile 
detention center and county jail, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court, also seeks to  
compel the gun industry to use so-called ``smart gun'' technology, 
rendering guns inoperable by anyone except the registered owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 30 people were killed by handguns in Camden County,  
across the Delaware River from Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit names 21 gun manufacturers, and also includes 20  
``John Doe'' manufacturers, distributors and dealers whose names 
are not yet known. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a dozen municipal or county governments have sued,  
including New Orleans, Chicago, Miami and Dade County, Fla.; 
Bridgeport, Conn.; Atlanta; Cleveland; Detroit and Wayne County, 
Mich.; and Cincinnati.

<HEADLINE> Continental Involved in Aeroperu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- U.S.-based Continental Airlines has agreed to  
take a 49 percent stake in Peru's flagship airline Aeroperu, which 
had grounded its flights in March while saddled with $174 million 
in debt, Aeroperu officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the airlines, along with Aeroperu's debtors,  
hammered out a debt restructuring agreement to refloat Aeroperu 
with a 30 percent stake in the airline going to debtors, 16 percent 
to Peru's government and 5 percent to workers, Aeroperu President 
Roberto Abusada said Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The stake Continental will acquire is worth about $30 million,  
said Hugo Silva, a spokesman for Indecopi, the state agency 
overseeing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental officials were not immediately available for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S.-based Delta and Aeromexico had each held 35 percent shares  
of Aeroperu, but had dissolved their stakes earlier in the year, 
deepening Aeroperu's financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Aeroperu's shutdown had left Peru with just one major air  
carrier, Aerocontinente, to serve its internal market, affecting 
tourism in the poor South American nation, tour operators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aeroperu is expected to resume its flights by June 22, Abusada  
said.

<HEADLINE> Louima Torture Called Revengeful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The patrolman who confessed to torturing a  
Haitian immigrant in a police station bathroom ``was the driving 
force'' behind the attack, but he had help from four other 
officers, a prosecutor said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutor Alan Vinegrad reminded the jury during  
closing arguments in the four officers' trial that patrolman Justin 
Volpe, who pleaded guilty midway through the trial, did not act 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to believe that something so depraved and so cruel  
could actually happen, let alone that it was two New York City 
police officers, in uniform, who did it,'' Vinegrad said in his 
three-hour summation of nearly four weeks of testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe pleaded guilty to civil rights violations last month after  
fellow officers testified that he bragged about ramming a broken 
broomstick up Abner Louima's rectum because he thought Louima had 
punched him outside a nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	The brutality of the act shocked the city and raised tensions  
between police and minorities. Four others accused with Volpe are 
leaving their fate with the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Charles Schwarz, 33, is accused of holding Louima down  
during the attack. Schwarz, along with Thomas Wiese, 35, and Thomas 
Bruder, 33, is also accused of beating Louima in a patrol car. The 
officers' supervisor, Sgt. Michael Bellomo, 37, is charged with 
covering it all up. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Bellomo, Wiese and Bruder face up to 10 years in  
prison. Schwarz, faces a maximum of life without parole, as does 
Volpe, who has not been sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
	But attorneys for Bruder and Wiese said in their closing  
arguments that their clients' only mistake was working with Volpe. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorneys noted that Louima never identified Bruder or Wiese  
as being among his four assailants, and that his version of when 
and where he was beaten was inconsistent with that of prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury was expected to get the case on Thursday, after  
attorneys for Schwarz and Bellomo made their closing arguments.

<HEADLINE> McCain Wants Social Security Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUN CITY, Ariz. (AP) -- Telling senior citizens Wednesday that  
Social Security is little better than burying savings in a tin can, 
Republican presidential hopeful John McCain advocated letting 
people invest some Social Security tax dollars in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-term senator, flanked by posters of himself as a Navy  
pilot in Vietnam, stepped away from Kosovo, the issue that has 
given him a national spotlight, to tell a crowd of about 70 people 
in this retirement community that Social Security must be reformed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't come here to warn you that your Social Security would  
stop coming,'' he said. ``That's not going to happen. This issue is 
more about your children and grandchildren.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said unless there is bold reform of the Social Security  
system, Americans could soon be paying 18 percent of their income 
to support the growing number of elderly Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said President Clinton had not carried out his promise to  
use part of the federal budget surplus to save Social Security. But 
he also criticized Congress for what he called loopholes in a bill 
designed to put Social Security funds into a ``lockbox'' to prevent 
them from being used for other projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The only way to support the retired is to allow them to use part  
of their Social Security tax dollars to invest on their own in the 
stock market, McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the same premise upon which the federal employee pension  
program and the 401K retirement plans are based,'' he said. ``It 
works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain trails Texas Gov. George W. Bush and former American Red  
Cross president Elizabeth Dole in the polls but his numbers have 
benefited from exposure in criticizing Clinton's decision not to 
use ground troops in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The reaction he got Wednesday from his elderly audience was  
mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	George Johnson, 72, a retired construction worker, liked what  
McCain said about Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, there's a risk with investing on your own,'' Johnston  
said. ``But it's a lot better than the system we have now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Aville Honeywell, a 67-year-old retired teacher, was  
skeptical about allowing private investment of Social Security 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of uneducated people out there who wouldn't know  
what to do with their money,'' she said. ``And I also think there 
would be a bureaucratic nightmare with all that money going in 
different places.''

<HEADLINE>  Investigators Examining Air Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Investigators sought Wednesday to  
determine whether an American Airlines pilot had adequate warning 
of a fierce hailstorm that struck the airport just before his jet 
slid off the runway on landing and burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of the 145 people on board were killed, including the  
pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	Scores of passengers, their clothes drenched with fuel, escaped  
the burning plane just before midnight Tuesday by squeezing through 
a twisted emergency exit and scrambling out gaping holes in the 
fuselage. Some jumped off a burning wing into a swamp. 
</P>
<P>
	``A fire started at the front of the plane and spread back,''  
passenger Barrett Baber said. ``Once the smoke got too thick, there 
was nothing we could do. People were screaming, `God, please save 
us!''' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal accident investigators said it was too early to say  
whether the rapidly moving storm caused or contributed to the 
crash. The storm packed steady winds of 50 mph and gusts of 75 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the pliot was aware of how bad things were on the ground  
is one focus of the investigation said George Black, a spokesman 
for the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ultimately a pilot's decision to land or not, but they  
have to base that on the information they have,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines executive vice president Bob Baker said  
regular weather updates were relayed to the plane's captain, 
Richard Buschmann. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight data and cockpit voice recorders, which were taken to  
Washington for analysis, should reveal what controllers told the 
pilot about the weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	The turbulent Flight 1420 from Dallas to Little Rock had been  
delayed two hours because of bad weather. Some passengers said the 
plane seemed to be coming in for landing faster than normal, 
although others said it did not seem unusual. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers said the MD-82 never seemed to get any traction  
before it slid off the left side of a runway, went down a rock 
levee and whipped around a metal tower supporting airport lights. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a hard landing, and in my opinion the pilot just never  
did gain control once we got on the ground,'' said Brigadier Gen. 
Stephen Korenek, 52, a passenger and commander of the Alaska Army 
National Guard who is a 30-year veteran of flights in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Jeff Arnold, a training officer with the Army National  
Guard in Alaska, said they hit the runway hard, ``but I've felt 
harder.'' He said the plane started to swerve when the pilot hit 
the brakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He eased up on the brakes and used the reverse thruster. He  
used the brakes again, and the plane swerved a second time,'' he 
said. ``It felt like the landing gear gave way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The steel stanchion they hit acted like a can opener, peeling  
back the plane's thin shell on the left side from the captain's 
controls through the first-class section. When the plane finally 
came to a stop, its tail was facing away from the runway on a low 
spot near an Arkansas River backwater. 
</P>
<P>
	Some survivors crawled on hands and knees through several inches  
of water and began pushing each other through the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I thought was that I was going to die,'' passenger Bonnie  
Montgomery said. ``Everyone was pushing and pulling to get out of 
that plane. We were on our hands and knees, and the smoke was so 
thick we couldn't breathe. Even I pushed a few people, because your 
natural instinct to survive just kicks in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coroner said nine people were killed. Hospitals treated 83  
people for injuries, mostly cuts and burns. Another 51 people were 
unhurt and were reunited with friends and relatives in a theater at 
a nearby aerospace museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people were unaccounted for but were presumed to have left  
the crash safely without notifying the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	The fatalities were the first aboard a U.S. carrier in nearly 1 1/2  
years. They also were the first in a commercial carrier at Little 
Rock's airport in its 82-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Radar images reviewed Wednesday by the National Weather Service  
showed the storm arriving at Little Rock's airport about the same 
time the jet arrived. There was no distress call from the cockpit 
before the landing, said William Shumann, a Federal Aviation 
Administration spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines' chief pilot, Cecil Ewell, said he would not  
have attempted to land the plane if wind speeds exceeded 57.5 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Black also said that power went out at the airport about the  
time of the accident, although he said it wasn't known whether the 
accident caused the power outage or whether any power outage 
contributed to the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Buschmann apparently died at the controls. The first officer was  
badly injured but survived. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot had been on duty for 13 1/2 hours, just short of the  
federal maximum of 14 hours. His day began in Chicago. He flew to 
Salt Lake City and Dallas before Little Rock. Ewell said such long 
days are common. 
</P>
<P>
	A check of the plane's maintenance records revealed no major  
problems. Twelve years ago, the plane lost power in one of its 
engines during a landing in Las Vegas because the housing around a 
part had worn away. 
</P>
<P>
	The deaths were the first in an U.S. commercial airline accident  
since Dec. 28, 1997, when a woman was killed aboard a United 
Airlines 747 that encountered severe turbulence over the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, aviation officials celebrated a fatality-free year  
aboard U.S. commercial flights. U.S. airlines also had one of their 
safest years ever in 1997, a year after one of the deadliest on 
record.

<HEADLINE> Wash. Pays Top Dollar for Tech Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Washington state is tops in the nation when it  
comes to the average compensation earned by high-technology workers 
-- and Microsoft stock options are a big reason why, a new report 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	The report to be released today by the American Electronics  
Association says the average high-tech wage in Washington in 1997 
was $81,400, compared with $62,800 in second-place California. The 
national average was $53,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock options within Microsoft certainly become a driving  
factor in pushing that average up,'' said Dennis Fusco, chief 
economist for the state Employment Security Department. ``I would 
assume that is why Washington ranks so much higher than the other 
states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey ranked third, with an average high-tech wage of  
$62,600; the District of Columbia was fourth at $61,900; and 
Massachusetts was fifth at $59,600. 
</P>
<P>
	In terms of the number of workers in the industry, California  
was tops with 784,000, followed by Texas, 376,000; New York, 
320,000; Illinois, 207,000; and Massachusetts, 205,000. Washington 
ranked 16th, with 97,025. 
</P>
<P>
	In calculating compensation, the association included bonuses,  
tips and employer contributions to 401(k) plans. Stock options were 
included only if they were exercised. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington has ``a concentration of software companies up there  
that classically pay more money than other computer companies,'' 
said John Hatch of the association's Silicon Valley office in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	Redmond-based Microsoft, the world's largest software company,  
said last month that it planned to boost employee pay to retain 
workers. The company had been paying workers at about the 50th 
percentile for the industry, and said it would raise that to the 
65th percentile. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's stock options that have turned hundreds of Microsoft  
employees into millionaires. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Government's Rail Monopoly Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALTOONA, Pa. (AP) -- For the two railroads that bought Conrail  
Inc., breaking up the 23-year-old rail monopoly was the easy part. 
</P>
<P>
	Many weeks, perhaps months or years, will pass before CSX Corp.  
and Norfolk Southern Corp. are ready to declare success in their 
attempt to redraw the Eastern rail map by absorbing portions of 
Conrail. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've had a great initial success but we have to be  
very vigilant here in the coming weeks in terms of safety and in 
terms of having all of our assets in the right place -- the people, 
locomotives and cars,'' said Pete Carpenter, president of CSX's 
transportation division. 
</P>
<P>
	Norfolk Southern and CSX heralded a new era in railroading  
Tuesday when they carved up a carrier set up by the government in 
1976 as the industry's last hope for survival. Conrail was sold to 
the public in 1987 and grew in value as railroads in general became 
profitable again. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's restructuring came at a time of heightened concerns  
over safety and service in light of a string of fatal accidents and 
prolonged disruptions that followed the 1996 merger of Union 
Pacific Railroad with Southern Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	Much was at stake as the new owners underwent the most complex  
restructuring in modern railroading, one that unlike typical 
mergers involved breaking up an active carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Major mishaps could delay letters and packages, impede commuter  
trains and boost shipping costs for farm products and consumer 
goods. Disruptions also could alienate shippers just as railroads 
are trying to become more competitive with trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole country's watching,'' said Ed Rastatter, director of  
policy with the National Industrial Transportation League, a 
shipping group. ``We're hoping against hope that the same mistakes 
with Union Pacific do not recur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although early reports indicated that the transition occurred  
with no major glitches, many of the operational changes have yet to 
come. And from a marketing standpoint, the railroads need to 
capture traffic that now moves by trucks to pay for the $10.3 
billion purchase of Conrail. 
</P>
<P>
	David Goode, the Norfolk Southern chief executive, told hundreds  
of workers gathered at a locomotive repair shop here, that the 
start of the transition went well. Beyond the need for smooth 
operations, Goode acknowledged the challenges ahead in making his 
business grow. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Railroad Administrator Jolene Molitoris toured rail  
operations in Altoona, Pa., and Jacksonville, Fla., encouraging 
employees to report problems and concerns to managers and 
regulators. She said more than 40 inspectors will be dispatched 
throughout the former Conrail system for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the first-day operations appeared smooth, but ``we are  
not going to be lulled into any sort of comfortable feeling that 
now everything is taken care of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CSX reported that fewer than 10 of its 180 trains in operation  
went too far or did not reach the proper destination. Those trains 
were moved to the correct locations early in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The day was one of both joy and apprehension for longtime  
workers. Railroad officials projected a net decrease in 1,500 union 
jobs, although the Altoona shop would gain positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been an optimist all my life, and there's no sense in  
changing now,'' said Paul Muri Jr., a welder who donned a 
``Gonerail'' T-shirt. ``It's scary in a way, but this is part of 
progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Workers joining Norfolk Southern got informational pamphlets, a  
souvenir bag and a baseball cap, while CSX employees got pins 
pairing CSX and Conrail locomotives. 
</P>
<P>
	The split of Conrail gives Norfolk Southern and CSX access to  
lucrative markets in the Northeast and restores competition for 
many shippers along former Conrail routes for the first time since 
1976. That was when Congress created Conrail out of six bankrupt 
carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Norfolk Southern and CSX now control virtually all rail traffic  
east of the Mississippi River, with tracks stretching nearly 45,000 
miles from Montreal to Miami and from Boston to Kansas City, Mo.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Auto Sales Exceed Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Domestic auto sales continued to surge ahead in  
May, driven by a strong economy and confident consumers. Some 
optimists even speculated that the industry's historic cycle of 
dramatic booms and busts may be over. 
</P>
<P>
	``There seems to be a developing consensus that this is a new  
plateau, not merely a surge,'' said Yale Gieszl, a vice president 
of Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Industrywide, sales increased about 6 percent over May 1998, not  
counting Suzuki Motor Corp., a small player that planned to report 
its sales today. Sales by European automakers were up 32 percent, 
Asian companies gained 11 percent, while GM, Ford and 
DaimlerChrysler's U.S. nameplates edged up 2.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	May's sales translated into a seasonally adjusted annual rate of  
17.3 million light vehicles, according to Morgan &AMP; Co. Though May, 
this year's sales were running at a rate of 16.6 million vehicles, 
compared with 1998's sales of 15.5 million vehicles. The record was 
1986, when 16 million vehicles were sold. 
</P>
<P>
	``A record year is within reach,'' Ford marketing chief Bob  
Rewey said. 
</P>
<P>
	May's year-to-year gains were expected to be muted because of  
the comparison to a particularly robust May 1998, when sales were 
boosted by a discount coupon war between General Motors Corp., Ford 
Motor Co. and what was then Chrysler Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	But a burst of sales over the long Memorial Day weekend helped  
most automakers end the month with impressive gains. Company 
records for any month were set by the Chrysler and Mercedes-Benz 
units of DaimlerChrysler AG, Toyota Motor Corp. and its Lexus 
division, Ford's Jaguar unit and Kia Motors Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnham Securities analyst David Healy said May was one of the  
two or three strongest months ever -- ``maybe the strongest month 
that wasn't influenced by changes in the tax law or other 
artificial stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford posted one of the biggest increases -- up 10 percent  
compared with a year ago. Its best May since 1978 was led by a 
surprising 18 percent increase in car sales, excluding Jaguar and 
Volvo. Ford's light trucks -- pickups, sport utility vehicles, vans 
and minivans -- were up 6 percent for a May record. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chrysler half of DaimlerChrysler was up 6 percent for its  
record month, led by an 8 percent increase in truck sales. James P. 
Holden, vice president of marketing and sales, said the company's 
economists keep expecting the market to soften, but so far there's 
no evidence of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market feels mighty strong, and I don't see that  
changing,'' Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM was the biggest disappointment in May's sales contest. Its  
sales were off 5 percent. Despite its hot-selling full-size 
pickups, overall sales of GM's light trucks declined 2 percent; its 
full-size SUVs took the biggest hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``All year long they've been giving away market share to the  
foreign brands while Ford and DaimlerChrysler have held their 
own,'' Healy said. ``May was just another example of that 
intensified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	European automakers once again had the greatest percentage  
gains. Though European companies sell far fewer vehicles in the 
United States than either the domestic or Asian automakers, they 
have been steadily gaining market share over the past two years -- 
mostly at the expense of GM. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the Europeans have had double-digit, year-over-year  
percentage gains for the past 20 months. In May, Volkswagen AG 
posted a 56 percent increase for its best May in 20 years; Saab 
Automobile AB, half-owned by GM, more than doubled its sales from a 
year ago; Ford's Volvo Cars unit was up 21 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Asian automakers also did well last month. Honda Motor Co. was  
up 6 percent for its best May, Nissan Motor Corp. posted a 10 
percent gain, and Toyota Motor Corp. was up nearly 5 percent for 
the best U.S. sales month in its 42-year history. Kia doubled its 
May sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford announced Wednesday that it would boost its second-quarter  
production by another 20,000 vehicles to a total of 1.282 million 
vehicles -- up 8 percent from the same quarter of 1998. It was 
Ford's third increase since its second-quarter production schedule 
was announced in March.

<HEADLINE> US Airways Workers To Get Raises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- US Airways plans to give pay raises of  
nearly 14 percent to 9,500 passenger-service workers who have gone 
seven years without a pay increase. 
</P>
<P>
	US Airways chairman Stephen Wolf and president Rakesh Gangwal  
said in a statement the raises are ``not only deserved but 
necessary, long overdue and critical in order for the company to 
operate effectively and fairly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The airline's action came four days after a federal Appeals  
Court overturned the 1997 election giving the Communications 
Workers of America the right to represent the workers, but a CWA 
spokeswoman said the union negotiated most of the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, workers protested at the company's annual meeting  
about going long stretches without raises while executives were 
awarded incentive plans potentially worth millions. 
</P>
<P>
	At that meeting, Wolf and Gangwal agreed to drop out of the  
incentive plan and acknowledged employee raises were overdue. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the pay plan announced Tuesday, each passenger-service  
employee will get a 13.7 percent pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the pay increases, the company said it will restore  
benefits and seniority accrual for part-time employees, and 
vacation, holiday and sick pay. Moreover, the management announced 
new overtime procedures, increased uniform allowances and job 
protection in case of subcontracting.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders Gov't Energy Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP)-- President Clinton is issuing an executive order  
calling on the government to use less energy and cut greenhouse gas 
emissions by 30 percent, administration officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's order -- coming at a time when many environmentalists  
have chided the administration for not doing enough to address 
climate change -- will be announced at a Cabinet meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government is the world's largest user of energy,  
more than $8 billion worth a year. About half is used to heat, cool 
and light its buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Government agencies will be required to increase efforts to cut  
energy use for lighting, heating and cooling to achieve a 35 
percent reduction by 2010, compared to 1985 levels. About half of 
that goal already has been accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
	Agencies also would have to show they're on a path to cut  
greenhouse gas emissions to 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2010, 
officials said. It is the first time the government has tied energy 
conservation programs to specific greenhouse gas reduction targets. 
</P>
<P>
	Carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels is a principal  
greenhouse gas that scientists believe is causing a warming of the 
earth as it accumulates in the atmosphere. The Kyoto climate 
agreement reached in December, 1997, calls for the United States to 
reduce greenhouse gases 7 percent below 1990 levels by 2008-12. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the administration signed the Kyoto treaty, the White  
House has come under increased criticism in recent months from 
environmentalists for not moving more aggressively to curtail 
heat-trapping emissions. The treaty has not been ratified by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine environmental leaders recently called on Clinton to ask  
Congress to raise fuel efficiency requirements for automobiles and 
to include stronger language to address climate change in proposed 
legislation to deregulate the electricity industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy conservation experts noted there have been five executive  
orders from the White House for federal agencies to rein in their 
energy use, dating back to the Carter administration. Both 
Presidents Reagan and Bush issued energy conservation orders, as 
did Clinton once before. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government is the biggest energy consumer in the world,''  
said David Nemtzow, president of the Alliance to Save Energy, a 
private advocacy group. ``The stakes are very big. And if the Feds 
can make it work, anybody can make it work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nemtzow said that Clinton's latest initiative appears to map out  
a series of ``realistic steps'' that may, in fact, produce 
substantial energy use reductions. ``They're trying to show this is 
not just apiece of paper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the order, agencies will be directed to private energy  
conservation contractors more, install more efficient lighting 
systems, boilers and cooling systems, improve building insulation 
and make wider use of renewable energy technologies. Annual 
progress reports have to be sent to the Office of Management and 
Budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The directive does not apply to energy uses for transportation,  
or many military or other activities tied to national security, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials also said the government by the end of this month will  
sign a contract with a private energy-use consulting company to 
upgrade energy efficiency in 837 buildings at five military 
installations in the Washington area. According to the White House 
analysis, energy use will be cut by 17 percent, saving $219 million 
a year, and greenhouse emissions will be reduced by 24,000 tons at 
the five facilities.

	``The Secret Life of Reinhold Messner'' (550 Music) -- The Ben  
Folds Five 

</P>
<P>
	The Ben Folds Five already proved with their last studio album,  
``Whatever and Ever, Amen,'' that not only can they incorporate 
influences like Squeeze, Elton John, the Beatles and the Beach 
Boys, but they can improve upon them and be absolutely hilarious to 
boot. 
</P>
<P>
	So why not tackle rock's concept album.  
</P>
<P>
	If Radiohead's stellar ``OK Computer'' was the ``Dark Side of  
the Moon'' of the 1990s, then this group's latest, ``The Secret 
Life of Reinhold Messner,'' aims at the hallowed ground of ``Sgt. 
Pepper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the grand statements made by Radiohead, ``Secret Life''  
is a concept album musically first and foremost. The Ben Folds Five 
takes the listener on a pop journey that continuously surprises. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't Change Your Plans'' follows in perfect ``Sgt. Pepper''  
mode only to unfold in a Burt Bacharach horn flourish. ``Mess'' 
mines the same rich Byrds vein that R.E.M. made a career of. There 
is even a soul track to an otherworldly answering machine message. 
The songs are flushed with strings, harmonies, quirky tempos and, 
of course, Folds' trademark baby grand piano licks. 
</P>
<P>
	That said, the songs on ``Secret Life'' aren't as good as this  
band's previous effort. Experimentalism and musicianship supersede 
its indelible pop instincts at times. There is no song on the level 
of ``Brick,'' the tune from ``Whatever'' that had at its 
well-disguised core a heart-wrenching tale about abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	When Radiohead unleashed ``OK Computer'' two years ago it was a

Folds could author such a masterpiece with his unique storytelling, 
but is only half-interested in doing so. Which is a shame.

	``Echo'' (Warner Bros.) -- Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  

</P>
<P>
	In the early 1980s, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers released two  
studio works of perfect pop rock: ``Hard Promises'' and ``Long 
After Dark.'' They were filled with men done wrong by their girls, 
often morally challenged, ``looking for something big.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Petty got happy and started exploring a less edgy side with  
former ELO frontman Jeff Lynne as his producer. 
</P>
<P>
	Freshly separated from his wife, Petty's recent woes are the  
listener's gain as the Heartbreakers' newest release, ``Echo,'' 
hails back to their leader's best work. Lynne is gone as producer 
and Petty gives a lesson in the A-B-Cs of rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
	The nasal-voiced Petty fills the disc with acid-tongued rockers  
like ``Free Girl Now, ``Swingin''' and ``Rhino Skin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But ``Echo'' offers an autobiographical dimension missing from  
most of Petty's well-established catalogue. The lyrics here may be 
the best he has ever written. ``Room at the Top'' captures the 
isolated millionaire good ol' boy without coming off as an exercise 
in self pity, while the title song and ``One More Day, One More 
Night'' simply has him breaking down. 
</P>
<P>
	Petty offers no solace to the heartbroken in ``Rhino Skin,''  
hissing, ``You need Rhino Skin if you are going to begin to walk 
through this world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Echo'' does have a few so-so tunes but the best of the songs  
rank with ``The Waiting'' or ``You Got Lucky'' from Petty's heyday. 
They may be even better.

	``Take Your Shoes Off'' (Rykodisc) -- The Robert Cray Band  

</P>
<P>
	Guitarist Robert Cray takes off his shoes, his socks and his  
bluesman label for his debut on Rykodisc. The result is a soulfest. 
Cray assembled his band in a Nashville studio and produced a fine 
rhythm and blues record that showcases his sweet voice more than 
his playing. 
</P>
<P>
	As if to give the record an extra measure of credence, he dips  
into the soul vaults to bring new life to Mack Rice's ``24-7 Man'' 
and ``Won't You Give Him (One More Chance),'' a 1964 hit for 
Soloman Burke. After 13 years with Mercury Records, Cray headed to 
the independent Rykodisc and used the occasion to give full voice 
to the soul roots that have always been a part of his music. His 
six originals are right at home with the soul covers.

	``Borders'' (Red House Records) -- Cliff Eberhardt  

</P>
<P>
	Songwriter Cliff Eberhardt explores boundaries on his second  
record for Minnesota-based Red House Records. There's a rawness to 
his voice and a spareness to his guitar playing that sharpens the 
emotion of his well-written lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lines,'' which pretty much defines the theme for the record,  
showcases some of his best writing. Eberhardt also offers a 
haunting Civil War account of the ravages of battle on those with 
no reason to fight in ``The Wrong Side of the Line.'' There are 
some quirky elements that mar ``Borders,'' such as the lyric bridge 
in ``Lines,'' but it's a heartfelt record sung with passion.

	``The Green Gate'' (J Seven Records) -- Phil DeGreg  

</P>
<P>
	Pianist and professor Phil DeGreg gets right to the point on  
this recording for Cincinnati-based J. Seven Records. DeGreg is an 
associate professor of jazz studies at the University of Cincinnati 
Conservatory of Music who also has played with the Woody Herman 
Orchestra, Slide Hampton, Stanley Turrentine and Eddie Harris. Here 
he leads a trio for most of the disc, playing straight-up jazz with 
confidence and authority. He has an easy grace and a strong sense 
of tradition. Four DeGreg compositions also showcase his writing. 
Tim Ries offers support on the tenor and soprano saxes as well as 
blowing some sweet solos to spice the mix.

	``Spirit -- A Journey in Dance, Drums &AMP; Song'' (Hollywood  
Records) -- Peter Buffett 

</P>
<P>
	Quite simply, this is a stunning recording. The compact disc is  
a recording of a live performance of composer/keyboardist Peter 
Buffett's celebration of Native American culture. 
</P>
<P>
	The live show, first done in August, includes more than 80  
performers, including 20 dancers and a children's choir, who use 
rock music, movement, chants and songs to pay homage to Native 
American culture. And while it is a celebration, the overall tone 
is of a civilization lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the third piece, ``Hidden Heritage,'' includes a  
recitation of tribes who have gone before. Robert Mirabal's flute 
work is particularly haunting throughout. A television presentation 
of the performance was broadcast by PBS nationwide in March and a 
live touring show is set to kick off in Chicago in October. Buffett 
is known for his score work for such films as ``Dances With 
Wolves'' and ``The Scarlet Letter,'' and TV shows like CBS' ``500 
Nations.''

<HEADLINE> Charismatic Draws No. 4 Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Charismatic's bid for the Triple Crown in  
Saturday's Belmont Stakes will begin from the No. 4 post, a spot 
that has produced eight winners of the race in the past 94 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In today's draw for post positions at Belmont Park, a field of  
12 was entered for the grueling 1 1/2-mile race, final leg of racing's 
Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic was installed as the 2-1 morning-line favorite,  
while Menifee, who drew the No. 10 post, was the second choice at 
7-2. The filly Silverbulletday, trained by Bob Baffert, drew the 
No. 3 post and was the third choice at 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, trained by D. Wayne Lukas, will become either the  
12th Triple Crown winner and first since Affirmed in 1978 or the 
15th Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner to fall short in the 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Charismatic win the Triple Crown, owners Bob and Beverly  
Lewis would collect a $5 million bonus from VISA, a sponsor of the 
three-race series. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 90-minute delay at the Louisville airport due to a  
rainstorm earlier today, Charismatic and Silverbulletday arrived 
safely at Belmont Park at about 11:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belmont field, with jockeys and odds, from the rail out:  
Teletable (John Velazquez, 99-1); Vision and Verse (Herberto 
Castillo Jr., 20-1); Silverbulletday (Jerry Bailey, 4-1); 
Charismatic (Chris Antley, 2-1); Pineaff (Sidney LeJune Jr., 30-1); 
Lemon Drop Kid (Jose Santos, 20-1); Patience Game (Kent Desormeaux, 
20-1); Adonis (Jorge Chavez, 20-1); Prime Directive (Mike Smith, 
30-1); Menifee (Pat Day, 7-2); Stephen Got Even (Shane Sellers, 
10-1); and Best of Luck (Jean-Luc Samyn, 6-1). 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee, trained by Elliott Walden, finished second to  
Charismatic in the Derby and Preakness, while Silverbulletday, a 
winner in 11 of 12 starts against her own sex, will run against 
males for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last two Belmonts, horses trained by Baffert were foiled  
in their Triple Crown bids -- Silver Charm by Touch Gold in 1997 and 
Real Quiet by Victory Gallop in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Raiders Sign RB Rashaan Salaam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Free-agent running back Rashaan Salaam is  
the latest former Heisman Trophy winner to join the Oakland 
Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
	The team signed Salaam on Tuesday to a one-year contact worth a  
reported $350,000. He joins fellow Heisman winners Tim Brown, 
Desmond Howard, Andre Ware and Charles Woodson on Oakland's roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``They gave me a chance to put on a uniform again, they gave me  
a locker again,'' the 24-year-old said. ``So we'll just take it 
from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salaam didn't play last season because of surgery in August on  
his right ankle. It was the same ankle that kept him out of part of 
the 1997 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to show them I'm healthy and that I'm an  
all-purpose back,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995 with the Chicago Bears, Salaam rushed for 1,074 yards on  
296 carries with 10 touchdowns. In 31 NFL games, he has rushed for 
1,682 yards with 14 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Salaam, 24, gained 2,055 yards with 24 touchdowns with Colorado  
when he won the Heisman Trophy playing at Colorado in 1994. He was 
the 21st overall selection in the 1995 draft by Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Adobe Systems To Cut 250 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Some 250 employees will lose their jobs  
at Adobe Systems Inc. this year in a restructuring plan designed to 
increase revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	That number represents 9 percent of Adobe employees worldwide.  
</P>
<P>
	The desktop publishing software company said Wednesday that 40  
percent of the job cuts will come from overseas operations, mainly 
in Edinburgh, Scotland. The savings will be used to increase 
investments in e-business and enhanced marketing programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Jose-based Adobe posted 1998 earnings of $105 million on  
revenue of $895 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also said it expects to report earnings for the  
second quarter ending June 4 slightly above the range of 62 cents 
to 66 cents a share it had previously estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	A First Call survey of 11 analysts put second-quarter earnings  
at 64 cents a share.

<HEADLINE> Astronomers Study Star's Behavior </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A star that erupted in a famous stellar  
observation 150 years ago has suddenly brightened again and 
astronomers are watching closely for what may be another celestial 
fireworks show. 
</P>
<P>
	Eta Carinae once was one of the brightest stars in the Southern  
night sky, but then it dimmed for decades. Now instruments 
monitoring the star have detected a doubling and tripling of 
energy, mostly in invisible light. 
</P>
<P>
	What puzzles astronomers is that Eta Carinae was not supposed to  
do this. 
</P>
<P>
	``Occasionally something happens in astronomy that is so  
bewildering that it makes astronomers nervous,'' said Kris 
Davidson, a University of Minnesota astrophysicist. ``This is 
weird. We don't understand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A report on the star was given Wednesday at the national meeting  
of the American Astronomical Society. 
</P>
<P>
	Eta Carinae has a prominent place in astronomy lore because of  
its history, its size and what experts believe eventually will 
happen to it. 
</P>
<P>
	The star, about 7,500 light-years from Earth, is among the most  
massive and energetic in the known universe, equal in size to 100 
suns. The energy it emits, much of it in invisible radiation, is up 
to five times more powerful than the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	Eta Carinae was a routine part of the sky in the Southern  
Hemisphere until the 1840s when it was observed to erupt with a 
massive outflow of energy, dust and gas. For awed watchers on 
Earth, it was as if a light bulb in the heavens was suddenly turned 
on. 
</P>
<P>
	``It became very, very bright and for 20 years it was one of the  
brightest stars in the Southern sky,'' said Davidson. For a while, 
its brilliance matched that of a supernova. And then it started 
becoming dimmer and dimmer until it faded from view to the naked 
eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronomers theorized, and later telescopic images confirmed,  
that the light from the Eta Carinae faded because an immense cloud 
of dust from the eruption was obscuring the view. They forecast 
that it would become visible again as the dust cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	That happened about 20 years ago when Eta Carinae blinked into  
view, dimly at first, after an 80-year absence. A widely published 
image from the Hubble Space Telescope showed the star at the center 
of barbell-shaped clouds. Astronomers expected the star to slowly 
brighten until, sometime in the next century, it again would become 
one of the a most prominent features in the Southern sky. 
</P>
<P>
	But Eta Carinae surprised the experts. Over a matter of months,  
telescopes detected the star spewing out vast amounts of energy in 
all bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. The star's image reached 
a visible brightness unequaled since 1864. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronomers had not expected such an energy burst for many  
decades and, when it came, it was expected that the star would 
first emit cooler radiation, sort of as a warning of a coming 
violence. That didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are about 6,000 stars in the sky visible to the naked  
eye,'' said Davidson. ``We understand them all with the sole 
exception of Eta Carinae. There is no theoretical explanation for 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eta Carinae's demise may bring another surprise. Stars many  
times more massive than the sun have short lives and spectacular 
deaths. Eta Carinae is only about 3 million years old (the sun is 
more than 4 billion years old). 
</P>
<P>
	Sometime in the next 10,000 years, the sudden explosion of Eta  
Carinae is expected to be seen. Davidson said theorists believe it 
may create a hypernova, a stellar explosion many times more 
powerful than a supernova. It could then start spewing gamma 
radiation in short waves that might equal the entire energy of the 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
	Such bursts ``might even be hazardous at 7,500 light-years,''  
the distance to Earth, Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
	A light-year is the distance light travels in one year, or about  
6 trillion miles. This means the events on Eta Carinae that are 
being observed now occurred 7,500 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Eta Carinae also could collapse, said Davidson, and become ``an  
instant black hole.'' This is an object so dense that its gravity 
will not permit even light to escape and is, thus, invisible to 
direct detection. 
</P>
<P>
	If that happens, said Davidson, ``it would just disappear,  
overnight.''

<HEADLINE> Accused IOC Member Testifies Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- An Australian IOC member accused of  
abusing his position testified for a third time before Olympic 
investigators Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Coles, who has resisted pressure to resign in the scandal,  
said he was convinced he'd proven his innocence to the special 
panel investigating charges of ethical misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confident I got my message across,'' a smiling Coles said  
after more than 2 1/2 hours of questioning. ``It was a very fair 
hearing. There were no real allegations. I had the opportunity to 
put all the facts on the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	International Olympic Committee vice presidents Anita DeFrantz  
and Keba M'baye, and executive committee member Marc Hodler will 
present their recommendations on Coles to the executive board at 
its next meeting June 14 in Seoul, South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel could recommend that the case be dropped or that Coles  
be expelled. Any expulsion would have to go to the full IOC 
assembly for approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles received a ``most severe warning'' from the IOC in March  
for accepting lavish travel and other incentives from Salt Lake 
bidders, and is now under investigation for further allegations of 
abusing his IOC status. 
</P>
<P>
	His ex-wife told the IOC that the couple received jewelry valued  
at $6,000 from a businessman associated with the Athens bid for the 
1996 Games. Coles appeared before IOC investigators on both of the 
previous disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest hearing centered on more recent allegations that he  
had compiled secret dossiers on IOC members for Sydney's successful 
2000 bid and passed them on to Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was purely about the matter at hand with the papers from  
the Sydney people,'' said Coles, who planned to return to Australia 
on Thursday. ``There were no surprises, no traps sprung. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was information, written and verbal, and I provided more  
evidence today. A lot of those facts weren't known. That worked 
both ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of the ``bad taste'' left following the string of  
accusations, Coles said he has no intention of stepping down from 
his position as an IOC member or from the Sydney Organizing 
Committee for the Olympic Games' board. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd have preferred not to have been through the hell I've been  
through over the past four to five months,'' he said. ``I am a 
three-time Olympian and I want to be available to athletes to reach 
the dream I reached. I want to continue to do that with athletes 
all over Australia.''

<HEADLINE>  Investigators Examining Air Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Investigators sought Wednesday to  
determine whether an American Airlines pilot had adequate warning 
of a fierce hailstorm that struck the airport just before his jet 
slid off the runway on landing and burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of the 145 people on board were killed, including the  
pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	Scores of passengers, their clothes drenched with fuel, escaped  
the burning plane just before midnight Tuesday by squeezing through 
a twisted emergency exit and scrambling out gaping holes in the 
fuselage. Some jumped off a burning wing into a swamp. 
</P>
<P>
	``A fire started at the front of the plane and spread back,''  
passenger Barrett Baber said. ``Once the smoke got too thick, there 
was nothing we could do. People were screaming, `God, please save 
us!''' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal accident investigators said it was too early to say  
whether the rapidly moving storm caused or contributed to the 
crash. The storm packed steady winds of 50 mph and gusts of 75 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the pliot was aware of how bad things were on the ground  
is one focus of the investigation said George Black, a spokesman 
for the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ultimately a pilot's decision to land or not, but they  
have to base that on the information they have,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines executive vice president Bob Baker said  
regular weather updates were relayed to the plane's captain, 
Richard Buschmann. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight data and cockpit voice recorders, which were taken to  
Washington for analysis, should reveal what controllers told the 
pilot about the weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	The turbulent Flight 1420 from Dallas to Little Rock had been  
delayed two hours because of bad weather. Some passengers said the 
plane seemed to be coming in for landing faster than normal, 
although others said it did not seem unusual. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers said the MD-82 never seemed to get any traction  
before it slid off the left side of a runway, went down a rock 
levee and whipped around a metal tower supporting airport lights. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a hard landing, and in my opinion the pilot just never  
did gain control once we got on the ground,'' said Brigadier Gen. 
Stephen Korenek, 52, a passenger and commander of the Alaska Army 
National Guard who is a 30-year veteran of flights in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Jeff Arnold, a training officer with the Army National  
Guard in Alaska, said they hit the runway hard, ``but I've felt 
harder.'' He said the plane started to swerve when the pilot hit 
the brakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He eased up on the brakes and used the reverse thruster. He  
used the brakes again, and the plane swerved a second time,'' he 
said. ``It felt like the landing gear gave way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The steel stanchion they hit acted like a can opener, peeling  
back the plane's thin shell on the left side from the captain's 
controls through the first-class section. When the plane finally 
came to a stop, its tail was facing away from the runway on a low 
spot near an Arkansas River backwater. 
</P>
<P>
	Some survivors crawled on hands and knees through several inches  
of water and began pushing each other through the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I thought was that I was going to die,'' passenger Bonnie  
Montgomery said. ``Everyone was pushing and pulling to get out of 
that plane. We were on our hands and knees, and the smoke was so 
thick we couldn't breathe. Even I pushed a few people, because your 
natural instinct to survive just kicks in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coroner said nine people were killed. Hospitals treated 83  
people for injuries, mostly cuts and burns. Another 51 people were 
unhurt and were reunited with friends and relatives in a theater at 
a nearby aerospace museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people were unaccounted for but were presumed to have left  
the crash safely without notifying the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	The fatalities were the first aboard a U.S. carrier in nearly 1 1/2  
years. They also were the first in a commercial carrier at Little 
Rock's airport in its 82-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Radar images reviewed Wednesday by the National Weather Service  
showed the storm arriving at Little Rock's airport about the same 
time the jet arrived. There was no distress call from the cockpit 
before the landing, said William Shumann, a Federal Aviation 
Administration spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines' chief pilot, Cecil Ewell, said he would not  
have attempted to land the plane if wind speeds exceeded 57.5 mph.

<HEADLINE> Failure in Nuclear Waste Disposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After spending nearly $500 million, the Energy  
Department acknowledged Wednesday that a crucial stage in the 
disposal of millions of gallons of highly radioactive waste is a 
failure and should have been abandoned years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The failed process involves attempts by scientist to find a way  
to separate the most highly radioactive material from less 
radioactive liquids in 35 million gallons of waste now being stored 
in drums at the Savannah nuclear weapons facility in South 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists found that the separation process, when handing such  
large amounts of waste, produces large amounts of explosive benzene 
gas, making it too dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson directed that the  
contractor for the project, a subsidiary of Westinghouse Corp., be 
replaced and that outside scientists be enlisted to help select an 
alternative separation technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the objections of the contractor, Westinghouse Government  
Services, the Energy Department quietly pulled the plug on the 
waste separation project more than a year ago. Since then, a number 
of alternative technologies have been proposed and will be pursued 
under a new contractor, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the problems could add years to a $20 billion,  
30-year program to dispose of more than 35 million gallons of 
highly radioactive liquid wastes at Savannah River. The idea is to 
convert the sludge and the most radioactive materials floating in 
the liquid into as many as 6,000 glass logs for eventual storage or 
burial. 
</P>
<P>
	About 650 such glass logs, using sludge waste, already have been  
produced at the $2 billion vitrification plant at Savannah River. 
But separating cesium and other highly radioactive materials in the 
liquid is crucial if the overall vitrification process is to work, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1983, scientists began pursuing so-called in-tank  
precipitation to separate the material. While it became apparent as 
early as 1992 that the process produced large amounts of explosive 
benzene gas, the technology continued to be pursued. In 1995, a 
separation plant was constructed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernest Moniz, undersecretary of energy and Richardson's top  
science adviser, said Wednesday there were ``clear warnings'' from 
a review panel in late 1992 or early 1993 that the technology would 
not work with such large amounts of waste. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was quite frankly mischaracterized. ... They kept looking  
for solutions,'' said Moniz in a telephone interview. ``They 
continued to try to find engineering solutions'' instead of 
shifting to alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
	A study released Wednesday by the General Accounting Office, the  
investigative arm of Congress, said the search for a substitute 
method for separating the liquid could take eight to 10 years and 
cost from $1 billion to as much as $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mismanagement (of the program) ... led to an extraordinary and  
pathetic waste of taxpayer money,'' said Rep. John Dingell, 
D-Mich., who had ordered the GAO report. ``All we have to show for 
$500 million is a 20-year delay and the opportunity to risk another 
$1 billion to make a problematic process work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moniz said that since the department directed a halt in the  
program in January 1998, it has spent $25 million on developing a 
number of alternative technologies. Among them involves using the 
failed technology but in much smaller batches of waste to reduce 
the buildup of benzene gas. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision on what technology to pursue will be made by this  
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Moniz said the waste separation problems could delay the overall  
vitrification program. ``We will have some delay depending on how 
fast we can get this new technology,'' he said. ``But it will allow 
us to go forward in the most expeditious way.''

<HEADLINE> Gates and Wife Donate $5 Bil. More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft founder Bill Gates and his wife,  
Melinda, have donated $5 billion to one of their philanthropic 
foundations, making it the third largest in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to announcing the gift Wednesday, the Gates family  
foundation said it, in turn, had given $50 million to the Program 
for Appropriate Technology in Health to help find a vaccine for 
malaria. 
</P>
<P>
	The $5 billion gift of Microsoft Corp. stock to the William H.  
Gates Foundation gives it an asset base of $10 billion. A second 
family charitable organization, the Gates Learning Foundation, has 
assets of $1.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	That would make the Gates Foundation, named after and  
administered by Gates' father, the third largest in the country, 
according to recent rankings by The Chronicle of Philanthropy. 
</P>
<P>
	The chronicle lists the Lilly Endowment, in Indianapolis, as the  
largest foundation, with assets of more than $15 billion, followed 
by the Ford Foundation at $10.7 billion. The David and Lucile 
Packard Foundation would be fourth at $9.6 billion, followed by the 
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation at $7.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates and his wife are estimated to be worth more than $80  
billion. The gift announced Wednesday follows a $3 billion donation 
by the Gateses to their foundation in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gates Foundation, started in 1994, provides grants for  
health, population and education projects worldwide. The Gates 
Learning Foundation, launched in 1997, works to spread Internet 
access and computer training. To date, the two organizations have 
made more than $475 million in grants, said spokeswoman Rose Berg. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has suffered from bad publicity in recent years,  
primarily from the government's antitrust lawsuit against the 
software company. Nielsen, however, said the charitable work ``in 
no way whatsoever'' is aimed at countering any negative image. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our work at the foundation has nothing to do with Microsoft  
other than our founder is chairman of Microsoft,'' he said.

	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Shawn Myrick, a senior guard at the University  
of Cincinnati last season, was indicted Wednesday on a charge of 
sexual battery. 
</P>
<P>
	Myrick, 22, was accused of having sex with a woman who did not

	PARSIPPANY-TROY HILLS, N.J. (AP) -- Four police officers fired 27  
shots at an unarmed motorist who rammed his car into their cruisers 
during a highway chase Wednesday, killing the man. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver, Stanton Lamont Crew, 31, was struck four times. His  
passenger was struck in the leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Police fired on Crew when he rammed his Camaro into two patrol

Prosecutor John Dangler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were in fear of their lives,'' Dangler said.

	Crew was chased when an officer spotted him driving erratically.  
</P>
<P>
	His passenger, Adrienne Lynn Hart, 22, told police that Crew  
said he had no insurance and could not afford to stop. Crew was 
driving with a suspended driver's license and had been issued a 
string of other traffic violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The chase ended after Crew drove off the road onto a patch of  
grass, was boxed in by police and shot.

<HEADLINE>  Investigators Examining Air Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Investigators sought Wednesday to  
determine whether an American Airlines pilot had adequate warning 
of a fierce hailstorm that struck the airport just before his jet 
slid off the runway on landing and burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of the 145 people on board were killed, including the  
pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	Scores of passengers, their clothes drenched with fuel, escaped  
the burning plane just before midnight Tuesday by squeezing through 
a twisted emergency exit and scrambling out gaping holes in the 
fuselage. Some jumped off a burning wing into a swamp. 
</P>
<P>
	``A fire started at the front of the plane and spread back,''  
passenger Barrett Baber said. ``Once the smoke got too thick, there 
was nothing we could do. People were screaming, `God, please save 
us!''' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal accident investigators said it was too early to say  
whether the rapidly moving storm caused or contributed to the 
crash. The storm packed steady winds of 50 mph and gusts of 75 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the pliot was aware of how bad things were on the ground  
is one focus of the investigation said George Black, a spokesman 
for the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ultimately a pilot's decision to land or not, but they  
have to base that on the information they have,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines executive vice president Bob Baker said  
regular weather updates were relayed to the plane's captain, 
Richard Buschmann. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight data and cockpit voice recorders, which were taken to  
Washington for analysis, should reveal what controllers told the 
pilot about the weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	The turbulent Flight 1420 from Dallas to Little Rock had been  
delayed two hours because of bad weather. Some passengers said the 
plane seemed to be coming in for landing faster than normal, 
although others said it did not seem unusual. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers said the MD-82 never seemed to get any traction  
before it slid off the left side of a runway, went down a rock 
levee and whipped around a metal tower supporting airport lights. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a hard landing, and in my opinion the pilot just never  
did gain control once we got on the ground,'' said Brigadier Gen. 
Stephen Korenek, 52, a passenger and commander of the Alaska Army 
National Guard who is a 30-year veteran of flights in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Jeff Arnold, a training officer with the Army National  
Guard in Alaska, said they hit the runway hard, ``but I've felt 
harder.'' He said the plane started to swerve when the pilot hit 
the brakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He eased up on the brakes and used the reverse thruster. He  
used the brakes again, and the plane swerved a second time,'' he 
said. ``It felt like the landing gear gave way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The steel stanchion they hit acted like a can opener, peeling  
back the plane's thin shell on the left side from the captain's 
controls through the first-class section. When the plane finally 
came to a stop, its tail was facing away from the runway on a low 
spot near an Arkansas River backwater. 
</P>
<P>
	Some survivors crawled on hands and knees through several inches  
of water and began pushing each other through the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I thought was that I was going to die,'' passenger Bonnie  
Montgomery said. ``Everyone was pushing and pulling to get out of 
that plane. We were on our hands and knees, and the smoke was so 
thick we couldn't breathe. Even I pushed a few people, because your 
natural instinct to survive just kicks in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coroner said nine people were killed. Hospitals treated 83  
people for injuries, mostly cuts and burns. Another 51 people were 
unhurt and were reunited with friends and relatives in a theater at 
a nearby aerospace museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people were unaccounted for but were presumed to have left  
the crash safely without notifying the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	The fatalities were the first aboard a U.S. carrier in nearly 1 1/2  
years. They also were the first in a commercial carrier at Little 
Rock's airport in its 82-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Radar images reviewed Wednesday by the National Weather Service  
showed the storm arriving at Little Rock's airport about the same 
time the jet arrived. There was no distress call from the cockpit 
before the landing, said William Shumann, a Federal Aviation 
Administration spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines' chief pilot, Cecil Ewell, said he would not  
have attempted to land the plane if wind speeds exceeded 57.5 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Black also said that power went out at the airport about the  
time of the accident, although he said it wasn't known whether the 
accident caused the power outage or whether any power outage 
contributed to the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Buschmann apparently died at the controls. The first officer was  
badly injured but survived.

<HEADLINE> Sugar Up on Russian Buying  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Sugar futures jumped Wednesday on the Board of Trade of the City  
of New York as Russian importers sharply increased purchases ahead 
of new tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, natural gas and unleaded gasoline rose  
sharply, while gold posted new 20-year lows. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar futures have been on the rise ahead of Russia's  
implementation of a new tax on Aug. 1. Shipments must be loaded and 
delivered to importers by the date to avoid the increased taxes, 
which are jumping to 45 percent from as low as 1 percent for raw 
sugar as that country moves to protect domestic growers. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is the world's largest sugar importer, but shipments this  
year to that country have been sharply lower because of economic 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	That came as Brazil, Cuba and other growers produced bumper  
crops, contributing to a global supply glut. Prices tumbled to 
their lowest in 14 years earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Raw sugar for July delivery rose .25 cent, or 4.8 percent, to  
5.49 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas futures rose sharply on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange amid concern that above-normal temperatures in parts of 
the country will force utilities to use more fuel at a time when 
domestic production is weaker than normal. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Gas Association was expected to report that storage  
remains below normal for this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, the National Weather Service again predicted  
above-normal temperatures in the Midwest and parts of the South. If 
those conditions persist, market participants are worried about 
shortages of natural gas later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline futures also moved higher after Sunoco cut processing  
at its Philadelphia refinery amid weak profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
	That move, which follows similar ones recently in Europe, could  
lead to spot shortages of gasoline during the peak summer driving 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Heating oil and crude followed unleaded gasoline higher.  
</P>
<P>
	July natural gas rose 6.4 cents to $2.407 for each 1,000 cubic  
feet; July gasoline rose 1.60 cents to 48.97 cents a gallon; July 
heating oil rose 1.06 cents to 40.19 cents a gallon; July crude 
rose 31 cents to $16.65 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold futures posted new 20-year lows on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange as investors continued to bail out of a market beset by 
concern over producer and government sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian producers this week dumped new supplies on the market  
in response to Britain's decision to sell more than half of its 
reserves beginning a few weeks. Prices have tumbled on that 
decision, and producers are dumping inventories as inventories sell 
for less than they cost to produce. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Belgium  
have quietly sold reserves, while Switzerland and the International 
Monetary Fund are moving to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	August gold fell $2.40 to $267.10 an ounce.

<HEADLINE> Bacteria Can Grow in Simulated Mars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- An exotic Earth bacteria thrives in laboratory  
conditions that imitate the environment of Mars, raising fresh hope 
that the red planet may harbor life now or at least did so in the 
past, a researcher says. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy A. Kral of the University of Arkansas said that a  
methane-making, oxygen-hating microbe ``grows just fine and dandy'' 
in a simulated Martian environment that could not support most 
forms of life on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Kral, who is reporting on his research today at the national  
meeting of the American Society for Microbiology, said he and a 
colleague, Curtis Bekkum, created an environment in culture dishes 
that closely mimics the environment of Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	The dishes contained no oxygen, but were bathed in carbon  
dioxide and hydrogen gases. The soil in the experiment resembles 
what is known about Martian dirt, with no organic nutrients and 
only a small trace of water. 
</P>
<P>
	``We make the assumption that there is liquid water beneath the  
surface,'' said Kral. Many planet experts believe Mars once had 
great amounts of water and that traces of it still remain beneath 
the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	Into this mix, the researchers placed a group of microbes called  
methanogens, a type of bacteria that on Earth lives in places where 
there is no oxygen, such as deep under the ground or around sea 
floor vents. Some types of methanogens even live in the stomachs of 
cows, where they help digest grass. 
</P>
<P>
	All of these types of microbes, he said, use nitrogen and  
hydrogen to make methane, a natural gas that can be used as fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	To determine whether the bacteria lived in the simulated Martian  
environment, Kral said he measured the amount of methane produced 
inside the sealed culture dishes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It made methane just like it does on Earth,'' he said. ``It  
grows just fine in the Martian conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the experiment is far from the final answer, Kral said  
the fact that the microbes thrived ``cautiously increases our 
belief that life on Mars is possible, or at least it was 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kral said the experiment also raises the possibility that the  
microbes could be used to cause a change in the planetary climate 
of Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	``If man were to go to Mars someday and introduce life, this  
might be the form of life that would grow there,'' he said. ``If 
you were going to try to create an Earthlike conditions there, 
putting this type of organism on Mars might be the thing to start 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kral said colonies of methanogens would give off methane gas  
that could help change the climate and temperature of Mars. The 
planet surface now is very cold; but if methane collected in the 
atmosphere, it eventually could create a greenhouse effect, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Methane is a greenhouse gas, which means you could warm up the  
planet,'' he said. Greenhouse gases allow sunlight to hit the 
planet's surface, but prevent the solar heat from escaping back 
into space. 
</P>
<P>
	Methane also could provide the energy for a human colony on  
Mars, said Kral. The gas can be used as fuel and could even be 
processed into a rocket propellant. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA has been studying the idea of one day sending a  
methane-producing robot spacecraft to Mars, Kral said. Using 
hydrogen brought from Earth and carbon dioxide from the Martian 
atmosphere, it would be possible to make and store methane, he 
said. The fuel then would be available when people are eventually 
sent to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	``They could use the methane to rocket themselves back to  
Earth,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Methanogen microbes, in theory, also could be used on Mars to  
make methane and provide the energy needed for a human colony 
there, Kral said.

<HEADLINE> Passengers Describe Ark. Jet Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- They'd already flown through buffeting  
winds and driving rain and could see flashes of lightning off the 
wings. But the first sense passengers on American Airlines Flight 
1420 had their landing was in big trouble was the sickening slide 
down the runway, as if the tires couldn't grip. 
</P>
<P>
	Seconds later, the skidding Super MD-80 spun around 150 degrees,  
slammed into a steel beacon tower on the banks of the Arkansas 
River and split into pieces. Jet fuel splashed over the passengers, 
and fire erupted in the economy section. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hit the runway too hard. Then we started turning  
sideways,'' said Randy Hill of Arkadelphia. ``The plane broke apart 
right in front of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone started yelling, `Get out, get out!' There was about  
a 10-inch gap in the metal in front of me. I pushed my way out,'' 
said Hill, who lost his shoes in the crash and was soaked in fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw a big chunk of the plane just fall away,'' said Jason  
Klamm, 19, of Pine Bluff. ``The plane seemed to stop about 10 
seconds after that. I looked back and saw a fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He and his father, Richard, 49, were in first class seats 2D and  
2E. They scrambled out through the shattered fuselage. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first got off the plane, I heard screaming,'' Jason  
Klamm said. ``It almost went in the river. I would say it was about 
100 feet from the river. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the smoke got too thick, there was nothing we could do,''  
said Barrett Baber, another survivor. ``People were screaming, 
`God, please save us!''' 
</P>
<P>
	Baber was seated in Row 30 and said flames were 15 feet from him  
by the time he escaped. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was panic, craziness. There were flames,'' Baber said.  
``The emergency door was cracked, and people were able to get out 
only one at a time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least nine people were killed in the crash, three sources  
told The Associated Press, but the airline would not confirm the 
toll pending reports from local officials and the National 
Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't know if anyone on impact was thrown into the  
swamp,'' American Airlines spokesman John Hotard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors waiting for rescuers stood on the edge of the river  
and watched their plane burn under pelting rain and hail. 
</P>
<P>
	``The patients we got in were wet,'' said Diane Ficker,  
Southwest Hospital's director of marketing. ``A lot of them had 
diesel fuel or aviation fuel on them. So we got extra clothes for 
them and hot coffee, and we have been trying to help them contact 
relatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and relatives awaiting the flight were told that the  
plane had landed and would be pulling up to the gate shortly. When 
it failed to arrive, they were directed to the Imax theater in the 
airport's Aerospace Education Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd at the museum soon grew to about 100. With vintage  
aircraft hanging above them, dozens of people waiting for 
passengers watched ambulances and fire trucks scream past outside. 
</P>
<P>
	No American Airlines representative was at the museum to explain  
what had happened, relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no word from the airline other than to come over  
here,'' said Tom Ashcraft, who was waiting for his two 
granddaughters, ages 13 and 11, to arrive from Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Two hours after the accident, Ashcraft discovered the girls had  
been taken to Arkansas Children's Hospital but did not know their 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	About three dozen survivors were brought to the museum in a  
school bus 2 1/2 hours after the crash, most soaking wet and wrapped 
in sheets or airline blankets. 
</P>
<P>
	Their relatives and friends rushed the bus, searching for loved  
ones. A few burst into tears when their search came up empty. 
</P>
<P>
	Another bus arrived 15 minutes later and the scene repeated  
itself.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Warns of Protectionism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned  
against growing protectionist sentiment Wednesday, saying it 
threatened to slow the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments to hundreds of business leaders helped calm edgy  
financial markets because Greenspan did not mention the economy's 
current performance. Specifically, he avoided mentioning the 
central bank's decision two weeks ago to shift policy to favor 
increasing interest rates if inflationary pressures start to mount. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan instead focused on trade, reiterating a warning he  
first sounded in April when he said the U.S. economy could be 
harmed if trade barriers were raised. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am concerned about the recent evident weakening of support  
for free trade in this country,'' he said in remarks at an 
international business conference here. ``Should we endeavor to 
freeze competitive progress in place, we will almost certainly slow 
economic growth overall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Free trade has come under attack by both the left and the right  
recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential hopeful Patrick Buchanan said Tuesday  
that free trade will end American sovereignty and cause the loss of 
American independence. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past year, organized labor has successfully defeated  
efforts to reauthorize so-called ``fast-track negotiating 
authority,'' saying protections against child labor, sweatshops and 
unsafe working conditions must be spelled out in trade agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	Fast-track authority would allow the president to negotiate  
trade deals that the Senate would have to accept or reject without 
amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, an ardent free trader, said it would be a ``great  
tragedy'' if lowered trade barriers were raised again by 
protectionist forces. 
</P>
<P>
	He also warned against tighter export controls on new  
technologies. Fears that manufacturers would be denied access to 
China -- a lucrative new market for high-tech products -- intensified 
this week after the House of Representatives issued a report 
detailing 20 years of Chinese espionage against the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Protecting markets from new technologies has never succeeded.  
Adjustments to newer technologies have been delayed, but only at 
significant cost,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan also attacked the Clinton administration's trade  
policy as too confrontational and too focused on job creation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We try to promote free trade on the mistaken ground that it  
will create jobs,'' he said. ``The reason should be that it 
enhances standards of living through the effects of competition on 
productivity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the chairman's silence on inflation calmed a stock market  
made nervous by fears that Fed policy-makers will raise interest 
rates when it meets later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the Federal Reserve put financial markets on  
notice that it would raise rates if inflation concerns continue to 
build. 
</P>
<P>
	In advance of his speech, the Dow Jones industrial average  
dropped 131 points. But it recovered most of the ground to finish 
with a modest loss of 18.37. Broader stock-market indicators closed 
with gains after reversing big losses.

<HEADLINE> ABC Defends Purchase of Video </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC on Wednesday defended its $16,000 purchase  
of videotapes and photographs of one of the Columbine High School 
gunmen, saying the transaction adhered to the network's policy of 
not paying for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	However, if the material is used again the network will inform  
viewers that the footage was paid for. 
</P>
<P>
	The material was aired last week on ``Good Morning America''  
along with an interview of Nathan Dykeman, a friend of Dylan 
Klebold. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC insisted it wasn't paying for an interview, since Dykeman  
appeared a week earlier on ABC News programs to talk about his 
friendship with Klebold. At the time, ABC was not aware of the 
videos and photographs, spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would never pay money for videotapes or home videos with  
the proviso that we get an interview. We felt this material was 
editorially useful. We thought that it explained more about the 
story,'' Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dykeman was brought back after the sale to explain what his  
material showed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold and classmate Eric Harris gunned down 13 people at the  
Colorado school on April 20 before shooting themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC bought broadcast rights to home video of Dykeman driving to  
school with Klebold, during which the boys joke about blowing up 
the high school. Another video, part of a school project, shows 
Klebold dressed in a trench coat and pouring lighter fluid on the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Dykeman's school yearbook also shows disturbing messages written  
by Harris and Klebold, including the words ``kill them all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the interview, ABC correspondent Don Dahler said on the  
air that the network had ``obtained the rights'' to the material. 
</P>
<P>
	``To us, that means we paid for it,'' Murphy said. ``But perhaps  
that's not as clear as it should be. 
</P>
<P>
	The material could be used again, perhaps on Friday when ``Good  
Morning America'' airs a town meeting on teen-age violence hosted 
by President Clinton at the White House. If it is, ABC will make 
clear that it paid for the videos and photos, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're not willing to acknowledge that we've bought  
something, perhaps we shouldn't have bought it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert on media ethics said that some news organizations pay  
for outside material, such as video of a tornado. But if it's 
something out of the ordinary -- as it was in this case -- the 
network should disclose the arrangement to viewers, said Bob Steele 
of the Poynter Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele said the payment disturbed him, since it appeared someone  
was profiting from a tangential involvement in a tragedy. Even 
worse, it raises the prospect of an unseemly bidding war. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's troubling to me that ABC becomes a partner in that kind  
of decision,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> British Steel Discusses Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British Steel PLC confirmed Wednesday that it is  
holding merger talks with Dutch steel and aluminum producer 
Koninklijke Hoogovens NV. 
</P>
<P>
	British Steel's share price jumped 16 percent on the news, while  
shares of Koninklijke Hoogovens rose by 0.5 percent in Amsterdam 
after increasing 5 percent Tuesday on press reports that there 
would be a merger. 
</P>
<P>
	A detailed announcement will be made by Monday, the companies  
said in a joint statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger talks come amid tough times for Western steel  
producers with relatively high fixed costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Koninklijke Hoogovens' net profit fell 17 percent in 1998 to  
$196.7 million, due largely to lower steel prices and increased 
competition from companies in Asia and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	British Steel posted a net profit of $364.5 million for the year  
ending March 28, 1998, down 27 percent from the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Rapped on Storm Handling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROMULUS, Mich. (AP) -- A lack of planning and communication by  
Northwest Airlines led to thousands of passengers being stranded on 
runways at Detroit Metropolitan Airport during a major January 
snowstorm, according to a federal report released today. 
</P>
<P>
	The report from the U.S. Department of Transportation found that  
Northwest did not violate any federal regulations during the 
blizzard that dumped nearly 2 feet of snow at Detroit Metropolitan 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the report said the conditions on the stranded  
aircraft, which included a lack of food and water and broken 
bathrooms, were ``severe enough to have jeopardized passengers' 
well-being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest spokesman Jon Austin said the airline has already  
fixed the problems the report cites. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody doubts the passengers caught in that snowstorm were in  
a horrible, uncomfortable, inconvenient position,'' he said. ``But 
our goal throughout the whole event was to ensure their safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The delays prompted a lawsuit from some exhausted, angered  
passengers who were stuck aboard planes stacked on runways for up 
to eight hours. Northwest accounts for about three-quarters of all 
flights at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, said the report showed  
the need for an airline passengers bill of rights and for more 
competition in the airline industry. 
</P>
<P>
	An airplane passenger ``has less rights than anyone in our  
society except someone on death row,'' Dingell said at a news 
conference at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, where he released the 
report today. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said Northwest officials in Minneapolis continued to  
send planes to Detroit at the beginning of the blizzard even after 
other airlines had canceled flights and said staff in Detroit did 
not communicate the severity of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also criticizes Northwest for not having a snow  
emergency plan for Detroit, even though it is the airline's 
second-largest hub, behind Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also says some Northwest officials said changes made  
since the storm would not necessarily prevent ``a recurrence of 
lengthy passenger strandings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a congressional hearing in March, Northwest executives said  
weather conditions were extraordinary. Wind chill was 30 below zero 
and on the first day of the storm, a Saturday, snow was falling two 
inches per hour, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Hirst, Northwest's senior vice president of corporate  
affairs, said at the March hearing that passengers were forced to 
wait on airplanes for gates to open because it was unsafe to bring 
them down the metal airline steps used by mechanics. The steps were 
frozen and slippery, he said, and passengers without proper winter 
clothing could have suffered from frostbite within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	But the report said Northwest ``did not consider all of its  
stair deplaning options.'' It noted that Northwest's snow plan for 
the Minneapolis airport includes options for using stairs, and said 
while Northwest was right to reject using maintenance stairs, it 
could have borrowed the right kind of stairs from other airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin said all available options were considered.  
</P>
<P>
	In February, Northwest apologized for the delays and released  
its plans to revamp the way the airline handles snow emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
	That report said Northwest will form ``Go Teams'' -- Northwest  
employees to be sent to Detroit when bad weather is likely. The 
airline also said it would set up a companywide system allowing 
instant communication among executives -- and make more phone lines 
available to employees calling to say they are or aren't available 
for work.

<HEADLINE>  ANC Expected To Win in South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- South Africans of all races  
tested their new democracy today, waiting patiently in long lines 
to choose a new government five years after Nelson Mandela's 
election ended the tyranny of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
	Voting went forward peacefully in a parliamentary election the  
ruling African National Congress is expected to win easily. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela, who is credited with bringing about the amazingly  
peaceful transition of power to an angry black majority, will 
retire June 16, ending a term aimed at reconciliation in a nation 
still divided by a shameful past. 
</P>
<P>
	His hand-picked successor, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, is  
expected to lead the governing African National Congress to a 
landslide victory and begin a term aimed at materially improving 
the lives of millions of disadvantaged blacks. The new National 
Assembly will formally elect Mandela's successor on June 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of South Africans voted today in ramshackle black  
townships, wealthy white suburbs, in villages in the Karoo desert 
and near the wind-whipped Cape of Good Hope. 
</P>
<P>
	In black townships, lines were up to a third of a mile long,  
with some people standing outside polling stations all night. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a lot of enthusiasm,'' Mbeki said.  
</P>
<P>
	Mandela cast his ballot at a country club in an upscale  
Johannesburg neighborhood, his thumb marked with ink to show he had 
voted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a wonderful experience,'' declared Mandela, who was  
jailed for 27 years for fighting apartheid, which denied blacks the 
vote and most other basic rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela asked South Africans to vote for the ANC -- but above all  
to vote peacefully. About 100,000 soldiers and police patrolled the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition parties tried to rally voters to prevent the ANC from  
winning a two-thirds majority in Parliament, warning that would 
allow the party to tamper with the constitution and consolidate 
power. Mbeki has denied such plans. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a message Tuesday night, the ANC asked voters for ``an  
overwhelming mandate'' to ``accelerate change in our country.'' It 
did not elaborate on the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign period has been remarkably free of violence -- a  
stark contrast to the 1994 elections, which were preceded by 
bloodletting by white supremacists and rival black parties. 
</P>
<P>
	As blacks, whites and people of other races quietly lined up  
together, common concerns were on their minds -- especially 
unemployment, crime and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can stop crime through Christianity, but moreover, job  
creation would help,'' said Michael Ledwaba, a pastor in a voting 
line in Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Marthinus van Schalkwyk, leader of the New National Party, which  
ruled during apartheid, lauded the election process as he cast his 
ballot in an upscale Cape Town suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	``My impression is ... it will be a peaceful election and every  
South African will have the opportunity to cast a vote without 
intimidation,'' he told reporters after voting in a school, located 
near a tennis club and golf course. 
</P>
<P>
	A few miles away, in a dusty squatter camp, John Gumede waited  
all night to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't get to my bed last night, but it was worth it,''  
Gumede said, clutching a small ANC banner. ``It's very important to 
vote. Everyone has to be counted so that we can get houses and 
jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	F.W. de Klerk, the last white president who opened the door to  
apartheid's fall, flew in from London and voted near Cape Town with 
little fanfare. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  ANC Expected To Win in South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- South Africans of all races  
tested their new democracy today, waiting patiently in long lines 
to choose a new government five years after Nelson Mandela's 
election ended the tyranny of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
	Voting went forward peacefully in a parliamentary election the  
ruling African National Congress is expected to win easily. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela, who is credited with bringing about the amazingly  
peaceful transition of power to an angry black majority, will 
retire June 16, ending a term aimed at reconciliation in a nation 
still divided by a shameful past. 
</P>
<P>
	His hand-picked successor, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, is  
expected to lead the governing African National Congress to a 
landslide victory and begin a term aimed at materially improving 
the lives of millions of disadvantaged blacks. The new National 
Assembly will formally elect Mandela's successor on June 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of South Africans voted today in ramshackle black  
townships, wealthy white suburbs, in villages in the Karoo desert 
and near the wind-whipped Cape of Good Hope. 
</P>
<P>
	In black townships, lines were up to a third of a mile long,  
with some people standing outside polling stations all night. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a lot of enthusiasm,'' Mbeki said.  
</P>
<P>
	Mandela cast his ballot at a country club in an upscale  
Johannesburg neighborhood, his thumb marked with ink to show he had 
voted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a wonderful experience,'' declared Mandela, who was  
jailed for 27 years for fighting apartheid, which denied blacks the 
vote and most other basic rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela asked South Africans to vote for the ANC -- but above all  
to vote peacefully. About 100,000 soldiers and police patrolled the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition parties tried to rally voters to prevent the ANC from  
winning a two-thirds majority in Parliament, warning that would 
allow the party to tamper with the constitution and consolidate 
power. Mbeki has denied such plans. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a message Tuesday night, the ANC asked voters for ``an  
overwhelming mandate'' to ``accelerate change in our country.'' It 
did not elaborate on the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign period has been remarkably free of violence -- a  
stark contrast to the 1994 elections, which were preceded by 
bloodletting by white supremacists and rival black parties. 
</P>
<P>
	As blacks, whites and people of other races quietly lined up  
together, common concerns were on their minds -- especially 
unemployment, crime and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can stop crime through Christianity, but moreover, job  
creation would help,'' said Michael Ledwaba, a pastor in a voting 
line in Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Marthinus van Schalkwyk, leader of the New National Party, which  
ruled during apartheid, lauded the election process as he cast his 
ballot in an upscale Cape Town suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	``My impression is ... it will be a peaceful election and every  
South African will have the opportunity to cast a vote without 
intimidation,'' he told reporters after voting in a school, located 
near a tennis club and golf course. 
</P>
<P>
	A few miles away, in a dusty squatter camp, John Gumede waited  
all night to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't get to my bed last night, but it was worth it,''  
Gumede said, clutching a small ANC banner. ``It's very important to 
vote. Everyone has to be counted so that we can get houses and 
jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	F.W. de Klerk, the last white president who opened the door to  
apartheid's fall, flew in from London and voted near Cape Town with 
little fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of voters waited for hours because some polling  
stations opened late. At others, ballot papers did not arrive in 
time and ID reading machines malfunctioned. But overall, elections 
officials said voting went smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
	However, one person was killed and another injured early today

<HEADLINE> Borders To Provide Instant Books </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Within a few years, many bookstores may have a pleasing answer  
for customers who can't find the book they want on the shelves: 
``Give us 15 minutes and we'll make you one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Publishers and retailers are taking notice of developing  
technology that will enable them to provide paperbacks on demand. 
It got a vote of confidence Tuesday from Borders Group Inc., the 
nation's second-largest bookstore chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Borders announced it had acquired a 19.9 percent stake in  
Atlanta-based Sprout Inc. Terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprout, founded in 1997, will provide the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based  
Borders with books in digital form that it licenses from 
publishers. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal will give Borders -- and the reading public -- access to  
older and out-of-print titles that the store wouldn't ordinarily 
carry, and may give the nation's second-largest bookstore chain new 
life as it tackles rivals Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Other bookstores, including small independent retailers, are  
considering the technology as well, seeing it as another way to 
broaden their appeal to readers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds like a winner for everyone -- publishers, retailers  
and consumers,'' said Jerrold Jenkins, publisher of Independent 
Publisher magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Based in Atlanta, Sprout has about 1,300 titles in a wide  
variety of topics and expects to acquire thousands more, 
spokeswoman Ashley Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
	As envisioned, the system would enable Borders workers to  
download digital versions of books. 
</P>
<P>
	Each store would have two digital printers, one for the cover  
and other for the pages. Employees could assemble the books in a 
binding machine that uses the same adhesive process normally 
employed for making paperbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can deliver a book to the customer in 15 minutes,'' Ms.  
Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average reader would see no difference in print and binding  
quality between the instant books and ordinary paperbacks, she 
said, although the machines can print color only for covers. The 
books' interior will be black and white. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't be a great idea for some children's books, for coffee  
table books,'' Ms. Gordon said. ``But for most paperbacks, it's 
going to be almost identical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The price for the book will vary, but will be similar to prices  
for books now on sale in bookstores, said Borders spokeswoman Ann 
Binkley. Officials are not sure when they will begin making the 
books widely available. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know the demand that's out there yet,'' said Ms.  
Binkley. ``But we do believe there's a market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Browsing at the Borders store in Traverse City, Mich., John  
Major said he'd be more likely to shop at a store with on-demand 
printing. 
</P>
<P>
	``There've been a few occasions where I wanted something and a  
store didn't have it,'' said Major, 29, a videographer from 
Marquette, Mich. ``If I knew they could get it right away, that 
would definitely bring me in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But to social worker Jan Stump, 39, of Traverse City, instant  
books are contrary to what reading is all about. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine doing that,'' she said. ``I worry that the  
pace is getting too fast. Maybe sometimes we need to wait for good 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprout is courting other bookstores in addition to Borders,  
contending its system would help them clear their shelves of 
little-requested titles and reduce the number of books returned to 
publishers when anticipated sales fall short. 
</P>
<P>
	How well it's accepted in the industry remains to be seen,  
though leading publishers are showing interest, said Stuart 
Applebaum, a spokesman for New York-based Random House Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology is ``in the incubation stage,'' he said. ``A lot  
has to be worked out before this becomes an accepted mainstream 
practice across the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to say whether the company had provided titles to  
Sprout. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Weinberger, co-owner of Readers' Books in Sonoma, Calif.,  
said he finds the idea appealing but predicted some readers would 
never warm to it. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can pop an out-of-print book out of the toaster in 20  
minutes and it may have the same words, but for someone who wants 
the original book that was printed in 1903 it won't be the same,'' 
he said.

<HEADLINE>  Pak Seeks Revival at Women's Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST POINT, Miss. (AP) -- Standing in water up to her calves,  
staring at a ball buried in the grassy bank of a creek on the 18th 
hole of a playoff, Se Ri Pak figured winning the U.S. Women's Open 
would be the toughest task she ever faced. 
</P>
<P>
	The real challenge is dealing with expectations that have  
swelled since that remarkable Monday at Blackwolf Run, when the 
20-year-old South Korean became the youngest champion in the 
longest Women's Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Having not won in the past 10 months, Pak arrived at Old Waverly  
Golf Club for the 54th Women's Open trying to defend more than her 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try my best, but every week I cannot get No. 1 in the  
trophy,'' she said, still struggling to learn English. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korean press wonders if her new boyfriend is the reason her  
best finish this year has been a tie for 18th. Some question her 
decision to split with swing coach David Leadbetter at the end of 
her sensational rookie season, when she won two majors. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, her countrymen didn't know the difference between a  
birdie or a bogey. Now, they expect her to win every time she 
sticks a tee in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I not play good,'' Pak said. ``They don't understand  
how tough all players, golf course condition, anything. Sometimes 
they are pretty upset, not playing good. That makes pretty hard 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conditions at Old Waverly are not nearly as brutal as they  
were a year ago at Blackwolf Run, when Pak and Jenny Chuasiriporn 
tied at 6-over 290 before their 20-hole playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	With showers Wednesday making the course even softer, rough that  
is little more than a nuisance and not much wind in the forecast, 
the record score of 10-under set two years ago by Alison Nicholas 
could be in danger. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the strength of the field?  
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps Pak should send home a postcard of Karrie Webb, a  
four-time winner this year who has not finished lower than 10th in 
her last 14 tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	Annika Sorenstam, who beat out Pak for player of the year in  
1998, is poised to make her first victory of the year a third 
Women's Open title. Juli Inkster and Meg Mallon have each won twice 
this year, and Dottie Pepper is riding a wave of confidence from 
her win in the first major, a record 19-under in the Dinah Shore. 
</P>
<P>
	All of them feel the pressure that comes with trying to win the  
most prestigious event in women's golf. 
</P>
<P>
	None of them carry the same burden as Pak.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know for Se Ri, there has been a lot of pressure for her to  
perform -- not really so much from herself, but her fellow country 
people,'' Nancy Lopez said. ``I think they expected a lot from 
here. And because it matters to her, it's probably put more 
pressure on her. 
</P>
<P>
	``She needs to have breathing room because she's not going to be  
perfect all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pak wasn't perfect last year, although it seemed like that  
during a torrid stretch of golf. 
</P>
<P>
	The centerpiece was the Women's Open, a championship that Pak  
nearly didn't win -- and probably should not have won. 
</P>
<P>
	On the 18th hole of the playoff, her drive was headed for the  
creek when it dipped down the bank and was caught up in the rough. 
Her chances slipping away, Pak stepped into the water, pulled out a 
wedge, closed her eyes and listened for the gallery to tell her the 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are screaming good news,'' she recalls. ``So, I am very  
happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She managed a bogey to force a sudden-death finish, and Pak  
burst into tears when she made a birdie putt two holes later. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very difficult to get,'' she said. ``Worked pretty hard. So, I  
got the trophy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Already having won the LPGA Championship, she became the first  
player since Inkster in 1984 to win two majors as a rookie. Pak set 
two scoring records in her third victory, then won for the fourth 
time in nine starts in the Giant Eagle Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakmania was born.  
</P>
<P>
	``Pure bedlam,'' said Laura Davies, who had to play with Pak and  
battle a Korean press corps that charted her every shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Pak was paired with Webb and Sorenstam during the first two  
rounds of the du Maurier Classic. A mass of photographers nearly 
stepped on Webb's ball in the rough during one scramble to get into 
position, and took pictures of Pak standing on the green as 
Sorenstam was in the middle of her putting stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	After the round, Pak required six officials just to get to the  
locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people, many attention, especially media,'' Pak said.  
``Sometimes it is pretty hard to handle it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She is a year older now, and the smile still comes easily. With  
advice from Lopez, Pak is learning to say no, trying to get a 
handle on the attention and the expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people ask me what happen because they think about last  
year,'' Pak said. ``I played good season. Right now, kind of quiet. 
Actually feel like more better than last year. Everything right now 
all set, ready to go.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST POINT, Miss. (AP) -- It doesn't necessarily take years of  
experience to win a major championship. Six of the last 10 U.S. 
Women's Open champions have been 20-somethings. 
</P>
<P>
	The major title was the first LPGA victory for four of the  
youthful champions. Defending champ Se Ri Pak and 1991 winner Meg 
Mallon earned their first tour wins earlier in the same season they 
captured the Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Youth and disregard for the real pressure of a major tournament  
appears to be an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I won the Open in 1995 and 1996, especially in 1995, I  
really didn't know what I was doing,'' said Annika Sorenstam, 24 
and a second-year pro when she first won. ``I was just going out 
there and I was just playing. Then things turned out the way they 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into today's opening round of the 54th U.S. Women's Open  
at Old Waverly Golf Club, Sorenstam is still one of the top women's 
golfers in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	After an LPGA record scoring average of 69.99 last year,  
Sorenstam has lowered that to 69.5 this season with five top 5 
finishes in nine tournaments. Sorenstam has been the LPGA Player of 
the Year three of the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
	But she hasn't fared well in the Open since her consecutive  
titles. She missed the cut in 1997 and then tied for 41st last year 
at Blackwolf Run in Kohler, Wis., with an 18-over-par total. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I expected myself to do better because I had done it  
in the past,'' said Sorenstam, one of three two-time Open winners 
since 1986. ``I thought, `Well, I'm older, I should be wiser. You 
know, I should be able to do this.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Pak became the youngest U.S. Open winner. The  
20-year-old rookie took the title after a 20-hole playoff with 
Jenny Chuasiriporn, a 20-year-old amateur. 
</P>
<P>
	Things have already changed for Pak, who hasn't won since  
capturing the Open and two other tournaments last July. The 
expectations, especially in her native South Korea, have swelled 
tremendously. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try my best, but every week I cannot get No. 1 in the  
trophy,'' she said, still struggling to learn English. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, many of her countrymen didn't know the difference  
between a birdie and a bogey. They now expect Pak, who hasn't had a 
top 10 finish this year, to win every time she sticks a tee in the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I not play good,'' Pak said. ``They don't understand  
how tough all players, golf course condition, anything. Sometimes 
they are pretty upset, not playing good. That makes pretty hard 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meg Mallon was 28 years old during her fourth pro season when  
the U.S. Open was one of her four victories in 1991. She now has 28 
career victories, including two this year, but hasn't won another 
major. 
</P>
<P>
	Jane Geddes, Laura Davies and Liselotte Neumann all have at  
least 11 career victories. But their firsts were at the U.S. Open, 
when they won in consecutive years -- 1986-88. 
</P>
<P>
	All six of those former 20-something winners are in this year's  
field. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those in the field that could be considered favorites are  
Karrie Webb, Juli Inkster and Dottie Pepper. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old Webb, a fourth-year pro who hasn't won a major,  
has won four times this year. In her other seven '99 tournaments, 
she finished in the top eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Inkster, a 17-year pro, has 19 career victories after winning  
twice this year. She has won three majors, but none in the 1990s 
and never the Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepper is riding a wave of confidence from her win in the first  
major, a record 19-under in the Dinah Shore in late March that 
provided her first victory since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In the month after the Dinah Shore, Pepper was forced to take  
some time off because of a bacterial infection. But she appears 
back in form, carrying consecutive top 10 finishes into the Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I eked out two top 10s by the hair on my teeth the last two  
times out, and done that when I haven't felt that I haven't been 
able to fire on all cylinders yet,'' Pepper said. ``I've had my 
instructor here to work with me a little bit. I think we made 
mirror adjustments that we needed to make, and I feel pretty good 
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conditions at Old Waverly are not nearly as brutal as they  
were a year ago at Blackwolf Run, when Pak and Chuasiriporn tied at 
6-over 290 before their 20-hole Monday playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	With showers Wednesday night making the course even softer,  
rough that is little more than a nuisance and not much wind in the 
forecast, the record score of 10-under set two years ago by Alison 
Nicholas could be in danger.

<HEADLINE>  Pak Seeks Revival at Women's Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST POINT, Miss. (AP) -- It doesn't necessarily take years of  
experience to win a major championship. Six of the last 10 U.S. 
Women's Open champions have been 20-somethings. 
</P>
<P>
	The major title was the first LPGA victory for four of the  
youthful champions. Defending champ Se Ri Pak and 1991 winner Meg 
Mallon earned their first tour wins earlier in the same season they 
captured the Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Youth and disregard for the real pressure of a major tournament  
appears to be an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I won the Open in 1995 and 1996, especially in 1995, I  
really didn't know what I was doing,'' said Annika Sorenstam, 24 
and a second-year pro when she first won. ``I was just going out 
there and I was just playing. Then things turned out the way they 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into today's opening round of the 54th U.S. Women's Open  
at Old Waverly Golf Club, Sorenstam is still one of the top women's 
golfers in the world.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Mechanics Get New Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal board on Monday cleared the Aircraft  
Mechanics Fraternal Association to take over representation of 
Northwest Airlines' 9,500 mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the National Mediation Board concluded the AMFA had  
violated the secrecy of ballots in polling last November and 
decided that another election could be held as soon as six months 
from now. A union normally cannot be challenged for two years after 
it is certified. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Association of Machinists, which lost the  
Northwest election, complained that some AMFA supporters made 
photocopies of their ballots during the polling. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows the blatant arrogance of the National Mediation Board  
for them to hold us back for six months and two weeks and then say 
the incumbent can have another election in six months,'' said AMFA 
President O.V. Delle-Femine. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the union would begin contract negotiations with  
Northwest as soon as officers are elected. The mechanics rejected a 
proposed contract last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	IAM has collected $400,000 in monthly dues since the election  
and plans to keep the money. 
</P>
<P>
	IAM officials said the union dues were used in the labor  
relations process to handle grievances and arbitrations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we're disappointed,'' said John Massetti, secretary  
treasurer of IAM District 149. ``This group will now begin a 
venture alone without the financial resources or political muscle 
and outside the mainstream of organized labor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IAM, which is affiliated with the AFL-CIO, represents  
Northwest baggage handlers, ramp workers, stock clerks, ticket 
agents, reservationists, office clerks and security guards.

<HEADLINE> Sales of New Homes Up 9.2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans have a case of home buying fever.  
New home sales reached their second highest level on record in 
April as buyers, trying to stay ahead of rising mortgage rates, 
rushed to close deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of new single-family homes jumped 9.2 percent in April,  
following four straight months of declines, the Commerce Department 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The surge pushed up sales of new homes to a seasonally adjusted  
annual rate of 978,000 units in April, the second highest level on 
record. The all-time high was a sales rate of 985,000 units set 
last November. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Americans, buoyed by a healthy economy but  
concerned about the prospects of even higher mortgage rates, are 
buying homes now to take advantage of existing rates, which have 
been creeping up. 
</P>
<P>
	``No doubt some of the strength in sales ... is due to buyers  
locking in before mortgage rates go higher,'' said David Orr, 
economist with First Union. 
</P>
<P>
	A national survey of mortgage rates showed them hitting 7.23  
percent for the past two weeks, the highest level in 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	And, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America reported  
Wednesday that loan applications increased 1.7 percent last week 
from the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because interest rates are rising, households are jumping off  
the fence buying homes to lock in rates. So you are going to see a 
nice boost in housing activity because of that,'' said the 
association's economist David Lereah. 
</P>
<P>
	The report on new home sales showed the surge in demand was  
accompanied by a rise in prices. The median price of all new homes 
sold last month climbed 3 percent to a record $159,500. The median 
is the midpoint where half the homes sold for more and half for 
less. 
</P>
<P>
	The average sales price rose 3.7 percent to $193,100, also a  
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts believed that the rise in home prices along with  
the jump in sales increase the odds that the Federal Reserve would 
jack up interest rates to slow economic activity down to a more 
sustainable pace and relieve rising price pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed next meets on interest rates June 29-30. At their last  
meeting, Fed officials changed their policy stance in the direction 
of leaning toward a rate increase, a move that has raised worries 
in financial markets that a rate increase could be imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	While stocks were down as much as 131 points at one point  
because of those worries, the Dow Jones industrial average managed 
to rally and close at 10,578, down 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Wednesday he was  
concerned about rising protectionist pressures in the United States 
but he gave no hint in his speech to a Boston business audience 
about the Fed's current thinking on the economy and inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had expected a fifth straight decline in home sales in  
April, contending that rising mortgage rates were cooling off what 
had been a red hot housing market. But the report showed strong 
sales in every region of the country except the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales surged 33.5 percent to an annual rate of 211,000 units in  
the Midwest. Sales were up 17.1 percent to a rate of 89,000 units 
in the Northeast and climbed 7.5 percent to a rate of 429,000 units 
in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	The West, which had seen sales jump 22.9 percent in the previous  
month, suffered a drop of 5.3 percent in April to an annual rate of 
249,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be the cooling-off pattern that we thought was  
developing hasn't really developed and it may in fact take the 
higher rates to hold for a little bit to truly cool this market 
down,'' said economist David Seiders with the National Association 
of Home Builders. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts believe that a 3.3 percent decline in existing  
homes sales in April and a sharp 2.4 percent decrease in 
construction spending -- including single-family homes -- for the 
same month were signaling a slowdown in housing activity.

<HEADLINE> BB Owners To Review Sale of Royals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Miles Prentice and the people trying to  
sell him the Kansas City Royals learned Wednesday they will meet 
next week with commissioner Bud Selig and baseball's ownership 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Prentice, Royals chairman David Glass and team president Mike  
Herman are scheduled to meet with the 11-member committee June 10 
in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	The ownership committee studies applications for franchise  
ownership and then passes the, along to the 30 major league owners 
for their approval or rejection, usually with a recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	Prentice, whose group has a deal to purchase the team for $75  
million, had hoped the ownership committee would take up his 
application next week at baseball's quarterly meeting in 
Pittsburgh, but Selig canceled the meeting last week, saying there 
weren't enough agenda items. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners have not met since January and aren't scheduled to gather  
until September at Cooperstown, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can only view the invitation to meet with the ownership  
committee as encouraging news,'' Prentice said from New York. 
``It's obviously a sign that the process is moving forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several baseball officials, speaking on the condition they not  
be identified, told The Associated Press last month that Prentice's 
group would not be approved in its proposed form and he would be 
asked to make modifications. 
</P>
<P>
	Some baseball officials were not happy with the size of  
Prentice's group, which numbers more than 40 investors, and want 
fewer people putting up more money. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig is concerned the group may not have enough money to  
operate the franchise successfully, several baseball officials have 
said, also speaking on the condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Prentice said he did not know what the committee wanted to  
discuss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope they want to talk about our application,'' he said.  
``But I don't know. I was out all day and Mike Herman called and 
said we just got word that we're back on for a meeting on Thursday. 
No one seems to know why or what. But maybe they're in a position 
to have some things to adjudicate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Royals' board gave its approval to the Prentice group's bid  
last November after he met its demand that more than half of the 
money be raised from Kansas City sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The team has been in ownership limbo since the death in 1993 of  
founder Ewing Kauffman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe in the integrity of the process,'' Prentice said.  
``We know we have a wonderful group that may be a little larger 
than they're used to. It's one of those things we have to work 
through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ownership committee includes Selig, NL president Len  
Coleman, AL president Gene Budig and four team representatives from 
each league: Bill Bartholomay (Atlanta), Andy MacPhail (Chicago 
Cubs), Drayton McLane (Houston), Bill DeWitt (St. Louis), Richard 
Jacobs (Cleveland), Peter Angelos (Baltimore), John Ellis (Seattle) 
and Mike Ilitch (Detroit).

<HEADLINE> Ex-So. Cal Coach Loses Pay Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court rejected an  
equal-pay suit Wednesday by Marianne Stanley, former women's 
basketball coach at the University of Southern California, saying 
USC was entitled to pay the men's coach more because he had more 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-awaited ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
sidestepped the most hotly disputed issue in the case: whether the 
higher revenue, greater publicity and resulting increased pressure 
to win in a men's program justified a higher salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley, now the women's coach at the University of California,  
contended those disparities reflected the university's 
discriminatory treatment of the women's program. The U.S. Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission backed her request for a trial of 
the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	But the court, in a 2-1 ruling, said it wasn't necessary to  
decide whether the job duties of the men's coach were more 
demanding, because the evidence showed that USC's men's coach, 
George Raveling, was more experienced and qualified than Stanley. 
</P>
<P>
	Raveling, according to published reports, was paid between  
$130,000 and $150,000 in 1993, when Stanley rejected the 
university's offer of a one-year contract for $96,000 -- a $26,000 
raise. 
</P>
<P>
	When USC hired him away from Iowa, Raveling had 31 years of  
coaching experience, had coached the men's U.S. Olympic team, had 
twice been named national coach of the year, had written books on 
basketball and had nine years of marketing and promotional 
experience, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley had been a coach for 14 years and had none of Raveling's  
other credentials, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``markedly different levels of experience and  
qualifications'' were an adequate nondiscriminatory reason for the 
difference in pay, said Chief Judge Procter Hug. His opinion was 
joined by Judge Stephen Reinhardt. 
</P>
<P>
	Dissenting Judge Harry Pregerson said the ruling overlooked  
evidence of sex discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	``The university's halfhearted promotion of the women's  
basketball program, its intensive marketing of the men's basketball 
program, and the formidable obstacles Stanley faced as a woman 
athlete in a male-dominated profession contributed to this 
disparate treatment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley's lawyer, Robert L. Bell, said he would ask the full  
court for a rehearing. He said a jury should be allowed to decide 
whether Raveling's greater experience justified his higher salary. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has less experience but has produced winning programs with  
less resources than Raveling had,'' Bell said, citing Stanley's 
three national championships as a coach at Old Dominion. She also 
played on two national championship teams at Immaculata College. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like saying that the woman's experience doesn't count as  
much as the man's experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	J. Al Latham, lawyer for USC and its athletic director, Mike  
Garrett, said the ruling was a particular vindication for Garrett, 
a former football star at USC and in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike Garrett offered Stanley a great raise, and for his  
trouble he got sued,'' Latham said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley's first four-year contract expired after the 1992-93  
season, when she made $70,000 in salary and housing allowances. She 
sought a contract equal to that of Raveling, whose teams had been 
less successful than hers. 
</P>
<P>
	Garret offered her a three-year contract starting at $88,000 or  
a one-year deal for $96,000, but Stanley said she wanted a 
three-year contract that would bring her up to Raveling's level. 
When Garrett refused, Stanley sued him and the university for $8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court refused to reinstate her in a 1994 ruling.  
Stanley was unable to get a coaching job for more than two years, 
and eventually was hired as promotions director and later co-head 
coach at Stanford before landing the Berkeley job in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's ruling upheld U.S. District Judge John Davies'  
dismissal of Stanley's suit without a trial. But the court told 
Davies to reconsider his order that Stanley pay the university's 
legal costs of over $46,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley's suit was far from frivolous, she had little money at  
the time, and the order ``could chill civil rights litigation in 
this area,'' the court said.

<HEADLINE> Volvo May Build Some Cars in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Volvo Passenger Cars, purchased by Ford  
Motor Co. this year, is considering building some of its next 
generation of cars at Ford's U.S. plants, according to chief 
executive Tuve Johannesson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in the nature of things that we at some time will have  
industrial production in North America,'' Johannesson said Tuesday 
at a meeting of business leaders in Goteborg, Volvo's headquarters 
city, according to the Swedish news agency TT. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo AB sold its car division to Ford in January for $5.8  
billion, saying that the technical challenges faced by carmakers 
could be best solved by large companies with substantial resources. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo's car production has been about 400,000 a year, a small  
number for the industry as a whole. Volvo AB's remaining divisions 
make trucks, buses, heavy equipment and marine and aircraft 
engines. 
</P>
<P>
	Johanneson said Volvo Cars wants to increase its production by  
some 50 percent to 600,000-700,000 a year by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is connected to the product line that will come after the  
S/V 40. The volume ambitions we have for these products say to us 
that they will go beyond the European capacity we have at the Born, 
Netherlands, plant of 150,000 cars a year and that we will need 
additional capacity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Born plant is jointly operated with Mitsubishi Motors of  
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Johannesson said there were no plans to begin Volvo production  
at other Mitsubishi plants, ``but our cooperation with Mitsubishi 
remains,'' the business newspaper Dagens Industri quoted him as 
saying.

<HEADLINE> Influx of Cubans Blamed on I.N.S </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- More than 200 Cuban refugees came ashore or were  
picked up off the Florida coast in a recent five-day span, an 
influx that some blame on a new U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
	In a clarification of the Cuban Adjustment Act, Immigration  
Commissioner Doris Meissner ruled last month that Cuban refugees 
are immediately eligible for a work permit. 
</P>
<P>
	Before her order, Cuban refugees were not guaranteed employment.  
</P>
<P>
	One Border Patrol agent said the new policy is the reason for  
the increase in refugees, most of whom paid smugglers between 
$5,000 and $7,000 to get here. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no fear of deportation, there's no fear of being held  
in detention a long time,'' Border Patrol agent Dean Sinclair said 
Wednesday. ``The most they'll be held is a week while they're being 
processed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Carmen Marrero, who works with refugees for the  
Catholic Charities Group in Miami, said recent refugees have not 
mentioned the change in INS policy as a reason for coming to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say they come here because they have no freedom and  
because of the economic problems'' in Cuba, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	INS spokesman Dan Kane said he saw no connection between the  
clarified policy and an increase in immigrants from Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard detained 272 Cubans found at sea in May, the  
highest monthly total since 1994. From Friday through Tuesday 
night, 222 came ashore or were picked up at sea.

<HEADLINE> Steel Makers Request More Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Leading U.S. steel producers broadened their  
fight against low-priced imports Wednesday, asking the federal 
government to impose punitive tariffs on a high-grade steel 
product. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry targeted cold-rolled flat carbon steel from  
Japan, Russia and 10 other countries in the third major round of 
trade complaints since imports reached record levels last year. 
They blame the import surge for thousands of layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest complaints came despite reductions in imports by  
roughly 40 percent since November. U.S. producers say foreign 
countries continue to flaunt U.S. trade laws that prohibit unfair 
pricing practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``In spite of months of fighting, American steelmakers, their  
employees and communities continue to be devastated by unfairly 
priced and subsidized steel imports,'' said Richard K. Riederer, 
president and chief executive of Weirton Steel Corp, one of eight 
steel producers joining the United Steelworkers of America in the 
official complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian economic crisis has reduced demand for steel abroad,  
leading foreign producers to find an outlet in a healthy U.S. 
economy. However, In part because of previous trade cases, foreign 
shipments have dropped for five of the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
	A Japanese steel executive, Hidenori Tazawa of NKK America Inc.,  
said the latest complaint ``has absolutely no economic or factual 
basis ... (and) only indicates the lengths to which U.S. steel 
mills are willing to go to stifle legitimate domestic and 
international competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The filings with the Commerce Department and the U.S.  
International Trade Commission seek steel tariffs to effectively 
raise prices of foreign shipments. The targeted importing countries 
are Argentina, Brazil, China, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, South 
Africa, Slovakia, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry accused the 12 countries of selling goods  
below production costs or home-market prices. Brazil, Indonesia, 
Thailand and Venezuela also were charged with subsidizing their 
producers to artificially lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department already has ruled that Japan illegally  
sold the industry's leading product, hot-rolled carbon steel, at 
unfair prices. The U.S. International Trade Commission is to 
determine next week whether the pricing practices warrant tariffs. 
Similar cases are pending against Russia and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest product targeted, cold-rolled flat carbon steel, is  
pressed from hot-rolled sheets into a thinner, stronger material 
that commands a higher price. Typical applications include washing 
machines, refrigerators and some internal auto parts.

<HEADLINE> Aging Panda Has Kidney Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After collecting more than 150 toy pandas,  
Tessa Schweigert finally got to see the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
	The awestruck 14-year-old from Powell, Wyo., was among the lucky  
visitors Wednesday to catch a glimpse of Hsing-Hsing, the National 
Zoo's giant panda, who is suffering from severe kidney disease, the 
latest in a series of ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been my dream,'' she said as the 28-year-old male  
panda wobbled around his indoor ``house'' and scratched himself in 
between bites of leaves. 
</P>
<P>
	Tessa ignored a crowd of reporters outside being updated by zoo  
officials on Hsing-Hsing's ailing condition. The black-and-white 
panda, the sole survivor of a pair presented to the United States 
by China, was recently diagnosed with kidney disease but has 
responded well to various medication and fluids. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's irreversible but stabilizable,'' said zoo veterinarian  
Lucy Spelman. 
</P>
<P>
	Vets discovered the kidney problems May 15 after putting  
Hsing-Hsing (pronounced Shing-Shing) under anesthesia for an exam. 
Zookeepers had noted the animal seemed lethargic and had lost both 
weight and appetite. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a day-to-day situation with him and that's just how we  
have to take it,'' said Lisa Stevens, the zoo's mammal curator. 
</P>
<P>
	The illness will probably be his last, Stevens acknowledged, and  
zoo officials are doing all they can to make Hsing-Hsing 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	The kidney problem is probably related to the animal's advanced  
age, Steven said. Zoo officials have ruled out extreme measures, 
including dialysis treatment. Dialysis would require daily 
anesthesia, a huge risk for such an elderly animal. Pandas rarely 
live to their 20s in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens reminded reporters that Hsing-Hsing was relatively  
healthy until two years ago when he was diagnosed with testicular 
cancer and underwent surgery. Veterinarians removed an enlarged, 
tumorous testicle. They also removed the other testicle as a 
precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	Hsing-Hsing also suffers from arthritis.  
</P>
<P>
	For now, the giant panda exhibit, a major draw for the National  
Zoo, which is part of the Smithsonian Institution, remains open 
although it closes periodically to allow Hsing-Hsing to rest or 
receive treatment. A handwritten sign posted at the exhibit's 
entrance informs visitors that ``Hsing-Hsing is not feeling well 
... at times, we may need to close the panda house to care for 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hsing-Hsing, along with his female mate, Ling-Ling, arrived in  
Washington in 1972 as a gift from the People's Republic of China 
following President Nixon's trip to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ling-Ling died of heart failure in 1992. None of the cubs that  
the pair produced survived more than a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Devra Kleiman, a senior research scientist at the zoo, said  
officials have discussed conservation and breeding programs with 
zoo officials in China for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have hopes of receiving another pair sometime in the  
future,'' she said. Kleiman said a team from the National Zoo is 
scheduled to go to China this month, and ``we hope to come back 
with an agreement.''

<HEADLINE> Public Interest in Environment Wanes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Americans are so discouraged by the difficulty of  
solving Earth's environmental problems that they have begun losing 
interest, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	That conclusion came from a review of public opinion surveys.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you keep telling people that global warming is dangerous,  
they're just going to get frustrated,'' said John Immerwahr, an 
administrator at Villanova University who led the review. 
</P>
<P>
	The nonprofit group Public Agenda carried out the review for the  
American Geophysical Union, which is made up of scientists who 
study the environment. The findings were released in Boston on 
Wednesday at the organization's annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, 51 percent of Americans said they worried a great deal  
about damage to the ozone layer, and 35 percent felt the same about 
global warming. In 1997, those numbers dropped to 40 percent and 24 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	More people worry greatly about water pollution than other  
environmental issues -- 61 percent. But even that is down from 72 
percent in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Immerwahr said the declines come not from apathy but from  
frustration with invisible, long-term processes like global 
warming, which is believed to be caused in part by the burning of 
fossil fuels. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's heard about it. Everybody's aware of it. Everybody  
thinks it's a real and bad thing,'' he said. ``Yet they don't know 
what to do about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Immerwahr said many people blame global warming on greed and  
selfishness of consumers and polluters -- a trend they view as 
irreversible. They doubt that nations or their citizens are willing 
to change their behavior or work together on solutions, he said.

<HEADLINE> Salma Hayek Talks To Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When Salma Hayek first arrived in Hollywood, she  
thought her fame in Mexico would propel her to movie stardom. 
</P>
<P>
	But she soon learned that being a household name in her native  
country would go only so far in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very rare that Hollywood writes a female character who's  
incredibly smart and sexy and also foreign,'' she says in the July 
issue of Glamour magazine. ``Hollywood has never been extremely 
receptive to Mexican actresses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hayek got her big break in the Antonio Banderas film  
``Desperado'' in 1997, and since then has starred in several films. 
She appears opposite Will Smith in next month's ``Wild Wild West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She is also set to star in the life story of Mexican artist  
Frida Kahlo, which will be produced by Hayek's own production 
company. It is a role was reportedly once coveted by Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
	``She (Madonna) probably hates by guts,'' Hayek said. ``But I  
hope not, because I'm a big fan.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Ready for Campaign Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- George W. Bush was entertaining some of his  
best Texas donors, but there wasn't a tenderloin or truffle in 
sight -- just bowl after bowl of peanuts and pretzels. 
</P>
<P>
	And little white cardboard signs that read, ``Enjoy your peanuts  
and snacks. Texas money will be saved for Iowa and New Hampshire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The inexpensive and unconventional tactic is all part of the  
Texas governor's plan to raise more money -- and spend less of it -- 
than the rest of the GOP presidential field. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is kind of like a Southwest Airlines fund-raiser,'' Bush  
joked Tuesday night, referring to the discount air carrier. ``Beer 
and peanuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of $1,000 donors dissolved into laughter as Bush made  
his maiden appearance at a campaign 2000 fund-raiser. ``If I decide 
to go further, I want to save some money,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush raised nearly $8 million between January and April while he  
was busy pushing tax cuts and school initiatives through the Texas 
legislature. The figure put him far ahead of the GOP pack -- and he 
did it without spending a single day on the campaign trail. 
</P>
<P>
	With the legislative session concluded, and Bush preparing to  
mount his first campaign swing next week, aides say he should raise 
at least $8 million more in the second quarter ending June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also has saved more money than his rivals by staying off  
the campaign trail and raising most of his cash in inexpensive 
ways, such as concentrating on $1,000 donors in lieu of pricey 
direct-mail campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent just 11 percent of his revenues in the first quarter.  
By comparison, Republican hopeful Gary Bauer raised one-fifth as 
much as Bush, but outspent the Texas governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush sits atop polls of the Republican field and beats Vice  
President Al Gore, the Democratic front-runner, in head-to-head 
surveys. He has sewed up scores of endorsements, including 
commitments of more than half of all Republican House members. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Bush and his advisers know the going is about to get rough --  
now that he is being forced to abandon the ``Yellow Rose Garden'' 
strategy for the perils of Iowa and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand the polls and the expectations are out of  
sight,'' Bush said in a session-closing news conference in Austin 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``As my daughter said, `Hey, Dad, you're not nearly as cool as  
they think you are.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He shared the same anecdote here Tuesday night. Besides the  
peanuts and pretzels, his supporters also were treated to a preview 
of the Bush stump speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't change my accent and I won't change my principles and  
I'm always coming home to Texas, but I'm looking forward to going 
out and seeing if America will like my ideas and like my style of 
leadership,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	With critics demanding more details from Bush on national  
issues, he said, ``I'll have specific agendas that I hope and think 
people will like. But at the beginning of the campaign, I'm going 
to set the tone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he will set that tone by:  
</P>
<P>
	--Promising to run a positive campaign. ``The campaigns of  
personal destruction must end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Talking ``about what motivates me. I'm going to remind people  
that I know what my most important job is. Forget the lofty title 
of governor, my most important job is to be a dad.'' He is the 
father of two teen-age daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	--Reminding Americans that prosperity alone is worthless. ``There  
must be a purpose to our prosperity and one of purposes as we go 
into the 21st century is to make sure one person is not denied the 
American dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Promising to set clear goals, refusing to be led by polls and  
uniting people ``as opposed to (dividing) them into groups, pitting 
one group against another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Demanding that Americans accept responsibility for their own  
actions. ``We must reject the culture which has said if it feels 
good do it and if you have a problem, blame somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
	``A leader must see a better world for everybody who is lucky  
enough to call themselves American. And I see a better world,'' 
Bush said. ``This is a nation that is based on such fundamentally 
sound principles that we can rise above petty partisanship, that we 
can rise above the temptation of putting people into groups, that 
we can rise above and solve America's most fundamental problems.''

<HEADLINE> Kashmir Rebels Dismiss Indian Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Islamic guerrillas occupying an icy  
Himalayan frontier on Wednesday rejected India's offer of safe 
passage out of the battle zone if they leave their dugouts and 
return to Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Jehad Council, which represents 14 militant groups,  
including four main groups fighting in the remote Kargil mountains, 
said the guerrillas would not leave the area because it is their 
``homeland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the Indians who need safe passage,'' Council chairman  
Syed Salahuddin told The Associated Press. ``The Indians are the 
occupation forces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Muslim guerrillas seized strategic mountain positions in the  
Indian-held part of Kashmir last month. India accuses Pakistan of 
backing the guerrillas in a bid to change the cease-fire line 
through the territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan, which denies giving military backing the guerrillas  
but allows them to train on its territory, on Wednesday also 
dismissed the safe passage offer by Indian Prime Minister Atal 
Bihari Vajpayee. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an indigenous movement ... and we have nothing to do  
with it,'' said Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Tariq Altaf. 
</P>
<P>
	India has launched a ground and air offensive to flush out the  
guerrillas from the mountain heights 440 miles north of New Delhi, 
the Indian capital. It says its troops have made major gains during 
the last week, but the militants claim they have not lost ``an 
inch'' during the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not possible to verify the conflicting claims.  
</P>
<P>
	Kashmir, a former princely state, has been the cause of two wars  
between Pakistan and India since their independence from Britain in 
1947. Each country holds part of Kashmir and claims the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Muslim militants, who have been waging a bloody secessionist  
insurrection for more than one decade in Kashmir, want either 
outright independence or a merger with Islamic Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	India directed all private cable networks to drop Pakistan's  
television channel Wednesday, accusing it of broadcasting biased 
news about hostilities, United News of India news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Casualties in the conflict continued to mount Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	India said Pakistan artillery left five civilians dead and an  
Indian television transmitter in smoking ruins. Indian air raids 
and artillery reportedly killed at least eight guerrillas and 
wounded five others in the Batalik sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan officials said all schools were closed near the border  
after three children were killed by Indian shelling in Nar, 50 
miles east of Pakistan's capital, Islamabad. India denied the 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
	Artillery duels and troop reinforcements in the area, more than  
70 miles south of Kargil, raised fears of an escalation along a 
second front. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Delhi, army spokesman Brig. Mohan Bhandari said Indian  
troops pushed back infiltrators two miles and were preparing to 
occupy four or five mountain peaks in the Batalik sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Close-quarters combat was reported for the control of a  
strategic peak where Indian soldiers have reached to within a few 
yards of guerrillas positions. 
</P>
<P>
	India says since the fighting began last month, 46 soldiers have  
been killed, 174 wounded and 12 missing. India estimates it has 
killed 400 guerrillas, but only a few bodies had been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	India and Pakistan -- two of the world's newest nuclear powers --  
have fought two of their three wars during the past five decades 
over Kashmir, which is claimed by both in its entirety.

<HEADLINE> Gates, Lawyers Tell Different Tales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the government's antitrust case against  
Microsoft Corp. winds toward an end in federal court, it seems at 
times that company chairman Bill Gates and lawyers representing the 
software giant are reading from different scripts. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, for the second time during the high-stakes trial,  
comments made by Gates have undercut the company's legal arguments. 
In the latest instance, while Microsoft argued in court that new 
devices might cut deeply into its business, Gates wrote in Newsweek 
that personal computers -- which depend almost exclusively on the 
company's Windows operating system -- would remain the industry 
standard for years. 
</P>
<P>
	The mixed message -- saying one thing to the judge and another to  
potential investors -- was immediately noted by the government's 
lead lawyer and a witness this week, when the trial resumed after a 
three-month recess. The government lawyer, David Boies, referred to 
``a cleavage of what the lawyers want to argue in court and what 
the company says.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In court Wednesday, Microsoft lawyer Michael Lacovara tried to  
minimize the significance of the billionaire chairman's claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``Isn't this exactly what you'd expect Mr. Gates to say, given  
his company's business?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	The argument that Microsoft faces stiff competition from a new  
generation of technology devices is intended to persuade the judge 
that the high-tech industry is sufficiently robust despite 
complaints about Microsoft's alleged aggression toward software 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	But in his Newsweek article, Gates wrote that personal computers  
would work ``in tandem with other cool devices'' rather than be 
replaced by them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given my job, it's hardly surprising that I'd say this,''  
Gates wrote, without mentioning his company's legal problems. ``But 
I'm betting Microsoft's future on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In seven paragraphs, Gates -- famous for his business acumen and  
his vast fortune -- managed to give the government another club to 
use against Microsoft in the courtroom. Microsoft even included a 
prominent link to the article on its corporate Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's first witness in the new phase of the trial,  
economist Franklin Fisher, said Microsoft's influence is not 
threatened by any new devices or emerging technologies, such as 
Internet TV, powerful game consoles or handheld appliances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe that's likely to happen, and according to a  
recent Newsweek article, neither does Bill Gates,'' Fisher told the 
judge Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time in months that comments from Microsoft's  
top executive outside the courtroom stood in sharp contrast to the 
company's position inside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the trial, economist Richard Schmalensee explained to  
Boies under oath why he couldn't provide precise figures about 
Microsoft's profits, saying the company's decidedly low-tech 
accounting techniques ``do not always rise to the level of 
sophistication one might expect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Boies pressed him, Schmalensee added: ``They record  
operating system sales by hand on sheets of paper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weeks later, Gates described in his newly published book how  
Microsoft tracks sales figures digitally by product and country, to 
determine exactly how sales compare with budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``When figures are in electronic form, ... workers can study  
them, annotate them, look at them in any amount of detail,'' Gates 
wrote in ``Business at the Speed of Thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courtroom, Boies said he never believed  
Schmalensee's explanation about paper ledgers at Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe Gates,'' Boies said. ``This time.''  
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft is particularly sensitive about questions about Gates'  
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The government previously played hours of his videotaped  
pretrial deposition in court, until the judge remarked: ``I think 
it's evident to every spectator that, for whatever reasons, in many 
respects Mr. Gates has not been particularly responsive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gates himself said in an earlier interview that he ``answered  
every question, completely, truthfully through many, many, many 
long days.''

<HEADLINE> Philly Exchange Urges Trading Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The chairman of the Philadelphia Stock  
Exchange on Wednesday urged Security and Exchange Commission 
Chairman Arthur Levitt to delay plans for extended stock trading 
hours that would put massive demands on exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Securities Dealers, which governs  
Nasdaq, approved a plan last week to extend trading hours from the 
current 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern time schedule, with a second 
session that would likely start at 5:30 p.m. and end at 9 p.m. or 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	The board of the New York Stock Exchange is expected to consider  
a proposal Thursday to extend trading hours starting in July as the 
traditional markets try to respond to rising competition from 
overseas exchanges and alternative computer-based exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia Exchange Chairman Meyer S. Frucher said in a letter  
to Levitt that alternative trading systems ``have increasingly 
assumed many of the economic functions of exchanges but not the 
full range of their regulatory functions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Levitt has said the SEC supports investor choice trading  
hours, the SEC also has suggested a delay so the industry would not 
be extending hours at the same time it confronts potential computer 
problems with the Year 2000 date change and shifts from reporting 
stock prices in fractions to using decimals. 
</P>
<P>
	``However attractive extended trading hours may be in the long  
run, extending them at this juncture would create massive 
additional technical and personnel demands on electronic and 
surveillance systems that are already under pressure,'' Frucher 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Weeks of tests have indicated no likelihood of severe Y2K  
problems, he noted, adding, ``It would be unfortunate to see that 
preparation upset by an ill-timed proposal that will require 
substantial resources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Orderly transition must remain a guiding principle in the face  
of any proposal to alter trading hours,'' he wrote. ``The rush to 
extend hours helter-skelter on a 'me, too' basis makes no sense.''

<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- The possibility that her nursing home will  
run out of money keeps Ruth Baron awake at night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm an early-to-bedder,'' Baron told a recent visitor. ``They  
don't have enough help. ... I'm ready to go to bed and there's just 
nobody to put me in bed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just can't do it on my own.''  
</P>
<P>
	Baron, 77, lives at Harris Hill Center, a nursing home owned by  
Pennsylvania-based Genesis Health Ventures Inc., one of several 
national chains that have taken a financial beating recently. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry blames the financial woes on cuts to Medicare, the  
federal health insurance program for the elderly. Some others, 
however, question whether the nursing home industry contributed to 
its own problems by borrowing heavily in recent years to expand and 
move into new businesses such as rehabilitation therapy. Now, 
they're struggling to pay back loans. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Sun Healthcare Group, one of the nation's largest  
nursing home chains with 390 facilities in the United States, said 
it failed to make a $7 million interest payment on a $150 million 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The entire industry did a poor job in terms of managing their  
balance sheet,'' said John Ransom, an analyst with Raymond James in 
St. Petersburg, Fla. ``They should have known this was coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nursing home officials insist Medicare cuts went deeper than  
initially planned, and that is what's causing their fiscal 
distress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our finances are out of whack because our reimbursement is not  
adequate,'' said Sun spokesman Charlie Leonard. ``It is ignorant to 
suggest we did something inappropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government used to pay nursing homes according to  
actual costs of caring for Medicare patients. Last July, it 
switched to a fixed-rate system. 
</P>
<P>
	Nursing homes complain that the switch, part of the 1997  
balanced-budget deal between President Clinton and Congress, has 
squeezed far more savings from Medicare than lawmakers intended. 
</P>
<P>
	And many nursing homes have been hit by a double financial  
whammy. 
</P>
<P>
	First, under the fixed-rate system, if a nursing home's costs to  
treat a patient exceed the federal reimbursement, it loses money. 
(If the costs are less, the nursing home profits). 
</P>
<P>
	Second, Medicare in January imposed a $1,500 annual limit in  
coverage per patient for physical therapy, and the same annual cap 
for occupational and speech-language therapy. Many nursing homes 
firms had set up companies to deliver highly profitable therapy 
services to their residents and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Staff members at Harris Hill Center said physical therapy and  
other therapy services have been particularly hard hit, but that 
patients haven't been affected yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're really pushing us to do more with less,'' said Janet  
Ripel, an occupational therapist. 
</P>
<P>
	John Allard, a Harris Hill administrator, said it will take time  
to adjust to the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to learn how to manage and how to live  
within this system in order to survive,'' he said. ``I have no 
reason to believe Genesis will go bankrupt. I have every reason to 
believe we will weather and adjust to this change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hospitals, which were moved to a similar fixed-rate Medicare  
payment system in the mid-1980s, also feared financial disaster. 
But the hospitals eventually learned how to survive under the new 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The nursing home industry wants the government to loosen  
restrictions on therapy services to allow exceptions for complex 
cases. It also want Medicare to raise nursing home fees so they 
take into account residents' high drug costs. 
</P>
<P>
	But federal officials are not sure changes are needed.  
</P>
<P>
	``What you're seeing is the failure of the industry to react  
quickly enough to what they knew was coming,'' said Nancy Ann 
DeParle, administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, 
which oversees Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Patient groups also aren't convinced of a problem.  
</P>
<P>
	American Association of Retired Persons lobbyist Tricia Smith  
said there's no evidence that Medicare beneficiaries are having 
trouble getting nursing home care. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, estimates that about 13 percent  
of Medicare beneficiaries, or 750,000 people, will exceed the limit 
this year. And many of those people won't be able to pay for 
coverage on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare routinely covers fewer than 15 percent of a nursing  
home's patients because the program does not cover long-term care. 
But Medicare can comprise up to 30 percent of nursing home 
companies' revenues because of the outpatient rehabilitation 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Shumway, New Hampshire's health and human services  
commissioner, has warned that some national chains could run out of 
money. He considers all 2,250 beds in New Hampshire's 
nationally-owned nursing homes at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those chains, while not in the same position uniformly, are  
experiencing financial difficulty due to the losses in Medicare,'' 
Shumway said at a May 17 hearing. ``The reduction in Medicare 
payments have been so significant for many nursing homes it has led 
to very real financial difficulties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Genesis, which owns 10 nursing homes in the state, has announced  
a loss of $10.8 million for the second quarter. Vencor Inc., which 
operates three New Hampshire homes, lost $12.4 million during the 
second quarter. The Louisville, Ky., company also failed to make a 
recent rent payment of about $19 million for its nursing homes and 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven New Hampshire homes are owned by Sun Healthcare Group of  
Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	Shumway says the state is keeping close tabs on homes owned by  
the chains to ensure that patients don't suffer. ``Quality of care 
has been assured,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Genesis' regional director, Arthur O'Leary, said the company has  
no plans to cut staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reality of the situation is we have to be able to provide  
a certain level of care, and we're not going to be able to do that 
with fewer people,'' he said. ``They have really just cut the 
expense for caring for folks, and we're kind of just riding out the 
storm and hoping legislators come to their senses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baron, the Harris Hill Center resident, said the home doesn't  
have enough staff as it is, though she enjoys living there. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to leave your home, but if you have to, this is the  
place to go,'' she said. ``If only they could get some help.''

<HEADLINE> Stars' Coach Ignores Tensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Ken Hitchcock has a curious way of handling the  
gut-wrenching tension surrounding Game 7 of the NHL's Western 
Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	He ignores it.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's almost a peaceful feeling that comes when you  
reach this stage,'' the Dallas Stars coach said Wednesday. ``You 
almost become relaxed because you know a lot of things that are in 
your control were put in place six months previous. 
</P>
<P>
	``You trust your players, you trust your own instincts, then you  
just go out and play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top-seeded Stars play the second-seeded Colorado Avalanche  
on Friday night in Dallas to determine which team will face Buffalo 
in the Stanley Cup finals. The Sabres wrapped up the Eastern 
Conference title Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche had a chance to eliminate the Stars on Tuesday  
night in Denver. They led 1-0 late in the first period but Dallas 
tied it in the second and scored three times in the third for a 4-1 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The two days off to prepare for Game 7 allows for a lot of time  
to think about a game that will determine whether they'll be 
playing hockey or golf next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nerve-wracking,'' said Dallas' Guy Carbonneau, a veteran  
of many Game 7s. ``But that's what you play for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado forward Theo Fleury has played in five Game 7s, so he  
has a good understanding of what it's like, even if his record in 
those games is 1-4. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's a bundle of nerves,'' Fleury said. ``Nobody wants  
to make a mistake out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Going into the series finale, neither team can claim much of an  
edge. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas is 6-2 at home in the postseason, but both losses were to  
Colorado. The Avalanche are 8-1 on the road in the playoffs, but 
the only loss was in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's Patrick Roy is the winningest goaltender in playoff  
history, but he's 2-3 in Game 7s. Dallas' Ed Belfour has a 
reputation for melting under playoff pressure, but he's 2-0 in Game 
7s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're going to see a great Game 7,'' Avalanche coach  
Bob Hartley said. ``The sad part of this is one team will be on 
vacation at the conclusion of Game 7.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock, who lost his only Game 7 as Dallas' coach, said  
experience has taught him that one team will dominate and clearly 
prove it is better. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not left up to the seesaw battles that some of the others  
are,'' he said. ``It's the team that plays the best in every aspect 
that usually wins -- the best 5-on-5, has the better special teams 
and the best goaltender.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars will definitely be fresher for Game 7 than they were  
in their last Reunion Arena appearance, a 7-5 loss Sunday in Game 
5. Hitchcock blamed his team's sloppy play partly on a 38-hour 
turnaround between games. 
</P>
<P>
	This time they'll have 69 hours.  
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you get extra time off at this time of year,'' he  
said, ``it can't do anything but help.''

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Shows Its Computer Skills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Open any personal computer and chances are  
most of its insides were made in Taiwan -- even though the companies 
that produce this technology are relative unknowns. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, however, they're strutting their stuff and trying to  
make a name for themselves at the annual Computex trade show in 
Taipei, one of the top three computer shows in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	With output forecast to rise nearly 15 percent to more than $45  
billion this year, Taiwan is firmly entrenched as the world's third 
largest producer of information technology products, behind Japan 
and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, apart from Acer Inc., Taiwan's largest maker of personal  
computers, few Taiwanese companies have established themselves as 
international brand names. For the most part, Taiwan remains a 
high-tech powerhouse whose firms toil in obscurity, crafting the 
parts for computers bearing other companies' names. 
</P>
<P>
	The other two big shows, November's Comdex convention in Las  
Vegas and March's CeBIT in Frankfurt, are where new technology 
often debuts and the big deals are signed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Computex puts buyers face to face with the people who  
actually make many of those products, companies that produce 
computers and their parts on contract for such household names as 
Compaq and IBM. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a chance to get together with clients, and for the  
smaller makers who rent the booths, an opportunity to show off 
their products,'' said Henry Chen, a sales manager with Compal, 
maker of computers for several top U.S. brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning as makers of basic computer parts and Apple and IBM  
knockoffs in the 1980s, Taiwanese companies have built a reputation 
for speed, cost effectiveness and flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
	A wealth of local engineering talent, entrepreneurial spirit and  
funding from venture capital companies have brought it to the 
forefront of the computer hardware business. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardware accounts for about 85 percent of Taiwan's information  
industry product output. At more than 800 booths, companies 
highlighted Taiwan's forte in all its breadth -- from makers of 
cooling fans and switches to assembled notebook computers barely 
thicker than a copy of Reader's Digest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Taiwan is still about manufacturing. Only really Acer Inc. and  
a few others can establish their brand names,'' said Watson Lu of 
industrial computer maker Axiom, standing in front of his company's 
stand on the bustling exhibition floor at Taipei's World Trade 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Taiwanese companies' skills in the made-to-order  
contract business, some new design trends were on display at the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	The semi-opaque hues of Apple's iMac glowed on everything from  
computer mouse devices to speakers. Notebook computers, an area 
where Taiwanese vendors have more than 50 percent of world market 
share, were smaller and more powerful, with sleeker finishes, 
sharper screens and even shockproof and waterproof models. 
</P>
<P>
	Several companies had lower-cost versions of cutting-edge  
products such as video phones. And Taiwan's monitor makers, who 
dominate the industry with more than 60 percent of global market 
share, had new lines of flat-screen LCD monitors that the companies 
say will replace boxy, traditional picture-tube monitors in coming 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer image scanners, another area where Taiwanese companies  
excel with 84 percent of the world market, came in smaller forms 
along with types that run on power from the computer rather than a 
separate outlet. 
</P>
<P>
	Other trendy items included digital cameras, Internet phones and  
game controllers in a myriad designs and sizes.

<HEADLINE> Stock Prices Rise in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asia's three biggest stock markets, Tokyo, Hong  
Kong and Singapore, finished higher Wednesday, leading shares 
across the region higher despite concerns that the U.S. Federal 
Reserve could raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo exchange rose for a third straight day on expectations  
that the government may stimulate Japan's economy with new 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 9.49 points,  
or 0.06 percent, closing the day at 16,417.99. On Tuesday, the 
index rose 1.84 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei's rise was limited as investors cashed in on gains  
after Tuesday's rally, following a plunge in U.S. technology stocks 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fears of a sharp fall in the Nikkei have abated,'' said  
Hiroichi Nishi of Nikko Securities in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders apparently were unconcerned by speculation that higher  
prices in the United States could lead to higher interest rates, 
which make stocks a less attractive investment. 
</P>
<P>
	On currency markets, the U.S. dollar slipped against the  
Japanese yen. The dollar bought 120.54 yen at late afternoon, down 
0.57 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also lower than its late 
New York level of 120.56 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, shares closed higher as strong buying in market  
heavyweight HSBC Holdings offset worries over the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 95.08 points, or 0.8 percent,  
to 12,458.64. On Tuesday, the index rose 1.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Banking giant HSBC Holdings soared 1.9 percent, lifting market  
sentiment worried over Hong Kong interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	ELSEWHERE:   	
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Shares rose as investors waited for fresh news on  
U.S. interest rates. The STI rose 18.48 points, or 1 percent, at 
1,927.36. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Shares soared 2.8 percent, rising for the seventh  
straight day amid foreign buying and expectations of faster 
economic recovery. The benchmark KOSPI rose 21.28 points to 775.00. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Shares rose 2.8 percent as favorable inflation data  
supported heavy buying. The SET index rose 13.07 points to 474.86. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Gates, Lawyers Tell Different Tales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the government's antitrust case against  
Microsoft Corp. winds toward an end in federal court, it seems at 
times that company chairman Bill Gates and lawyers representing the 
software giant are reading from different scripts. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, for the second time during the high-stakes trial,  
comments made by Gates have undercut the company's legal arguments. 
In the latest instance, while Microsoft argued in court that new 
devices might cut deeply into its business, Gates wrote in Newsweek 
that personal computers -- which depend almost exclusively on the 
company's Windows operating system -- would remain the industry 
standard for years. 
</P>
<P>
	The mixed message -- saying one thing to the judge and another to  
potential investors -- was immediately noted by the government's 
lead lawyer and a witness this week, when the trial resumed after a 
three-month recess. The government lawyer, David Boies, referred to 
``a cleavage of what the lawyers want to argue in court and what 
the company says.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In court Wednesday, Microsoft lawyer Michael Lacovara tried to  
minimize the significance of the billionaire chairman's claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``Isn't this exactly what you'd expect Mr. Gates to say, given  
his company's business?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	The argument that Microsoft faces stiff competition from a new  
generation of technology devices is intended to persuade the judge 
that the high-tech industry is sufficiently robust despite 
complaints about Microsoft's alleged aggression toward software 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	But in his Newsweek article, Gates wrote that personal computers  
would work ``in tandem with other cool devices'' rather than be 
replaced by them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given my job, it's hardly surprising that I'd say this,''  
Gates wrote, without mentioning his company's legal problems. ``But 
I'm betting Microsoft's future on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In seven paragraphs, Gates -- famous for his business acumen and  
his vast fortune -- managed to give the government another club to 
use against Microsoft in the courtroom. Microsoft even included a 
prominent link to the article on its corporate Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's first witness in the new phase of the trial,  
economist Franklin Fisher, said Microsoft's influence is not 
threatened by any new devices or emerging technologies, such as 
Internet TV, powerful game consoles or handheld appliances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe that's likely to happen, and according to a  
recent Newsweek article, neither does Bill Gates,'' Fisher told the 
judge Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time in months that comments from Microsoft's  
top executive outside the courtroom stood in sharp contrast to the 
company's position inside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the trial, economist Richard Schmalensee explained to  
Boies under oath why he couldn't provide precise figures about 
Microsoft's profits, saying the company's decidedly low-tech 
accounting techniques ``do not always rise to the level of 
sophistication one might expect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Boies pressed him, Schmalensee added: ``They record  
operating system sales by hand on sheets of paper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weeks later, Gates described in his newly published book how  
Microsoft tracks sales figures digitally by product and country, to 
determine exactly how sales compare with budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``When figures are in electronic form, ... workers can study  
them, annotate them, look at them in any amount of detail,'' Gates 
wrote in ``Business at the Speed of Thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courtroom, Boies said he never believed  
Schmalensee's explanation about paper ledgers at Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe Gates,'' Boies said. ``This time.''  
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft is particularly sensitive about questions about Gates'  
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The government previously played hours of his videotaped  
pretrial deposition in court, until the judge remarked: ``I think 
it's evident to every spectator that, for whatever reasons, in many 
respects Mr. Gates has not been particularly responsive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gates himself said in an earlier interview that he ``answered  
every question, completely, truthfully through many, many, many 
long days.''

<HEADLINE>  Pilot in Crash Had Worked 13 1/2 Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- American Airlines pilot Richard  
Buschmann had been on duty for 13 1/2 hours as he tried to land in a 
severe thunderstorm. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Buschmann, who had significant experience with MD-80 jets,  
was nearing his maximum of roughly 14 hours on duty when the plane 
skidded off an Arkansas runway shortly before midnight Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet crashed against a light tower at the Little Rock airport  
and burst into flames, killing nine people. 
</P>
<P>
	American's chief pilot, Cecil Ewell, said such long days and  
difficult flying conditions are not talked about often, but are not 
infrequent for airline pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are the kinds of things you don't hear about. These guys  
work very hard,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buschmann was the airline's chief pilot in Chicago, with 9,600  
flight hours and 5,500 flight hours on MD-80s, the same class as 
the MD-82 twin-engine jet that crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	His experience qualified him to check other American pilots on  
their handling of that aircraft, American spokeswoman Andrea Rader 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both he and the other pilot in the cockpit, First Officer  
Michael Origel, were nearing their federally regulated maximum of 
roughly 14 hours when the plane crashed. Their scheduled 11-hour 
day, with 3 flights, ran long because of delays, including 
thunderstorms in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they couldn't get to Little Rock within the limits, we  
never would have sent them,'' said Bob Baker, executive vice 
president of flight operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Origel, who escaped with a broken leg, joined Fort Worth,  
Texas-based American in February and was based in Chicago. In bad 
weather, the first officer's responsibility would have been manning 
the radios to get weather reports from the airport control tower. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the four flight attendants also were injured. Nancy Luna  
suffered a fractured pelvis and Jennifer Chapman broke her leg.

<HEADLINE> Landscaping Recreates Old Gardens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POUND RIDGE, N.Y. (AP) -- Some people are recreating their yards  
to go back in time. 
</P>
<P>
	It's called ``period landscaping'' and is enjoying a vogue.  
Books are devoted to it and classes are held in prestigious places 
like the New York Botanical Garden. And you can find help from 
landscape designers. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, it makes most sense if you have an authentic old  
house to go with the garden or at least one that was built to match 
a period, for example, a Cape Cod house. 
</P>
<P>
	That narrows the field considerably. Here in my southern New  
York village we have, out of a total of 1,800 dwellings, about 125 
that go back to the 18th and early 19th centuries. 
</P>
<P>
	I'm drawn to this somewhat myself because of an 18th-century  
barn my family shares as a summer hangout. 
</P>
<P>
	As landscapes go, our barnyard is bordered by a picturesque  
sheep pen farmers built ages ago laboriously piling stone upon 
stone. Thinking back on the struggling men and oxen moving the 
bigger stones into place, we enjoy some perfect nostalgia. And, 
unlike a garden, our vision needs no maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
	Exploring the trend, I talked to a couple of people about their  
old trees and plants and features like stone fences. 
</P>
<P>
	In the realm of authentic old residences, my next-door neighbor,  
Carol Martin Cioppa, has a small wooden house that bears a brass 
plaque reading 1760. What's more, she's a professional architect 
and likes the idea of old-looking gardens. 
</P>
<P>
	When she bought the house a few years ago, some landscape  
authenticity was already in place in the form of old maple trees, a 
stone wellhead and stone fences. 
</P>
<P>
	But the gardening needed work. She said she read books about the  
restoration of Williamsburg, Va., and looked at houses the size and 
scale of her own and thought, ``Well, I can recreate something like 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She started by planting boxwood hedges in front of the doorway.  
Among other things, boxwoods enjoy a big advantage nowadays: Deer 
don't eat them. 
</P>
<P>
	But they can suffer in Northern winters, so Ms. Cioppa bought  
the hardier Korean boxwood. She realized she may have sacrificed a 
touch of the authentic, but she said what she wanted primarily was 
``a view of historical look.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She's also using hedges and flagstones to enclose or outline an  
herb garden and other enclaves of ornamental plantings. She said 
what she sought most was harmony. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to make the kind of garden that would have been  
fashioned at the time,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among plants she's growing which she linked to historical  
backgrounds are columbine, dianthus, clematis montana, purple 
echinacea, digitalis, iris cristata, many lily varieties, 
honeysuckle, narcissus, primulas and herbs like thyme, sage, chives 
and lovage. 
</P>
<P>
	Quincy Stuart grew up in a 1740 house she later inherited from  
her parents, who were dedicated gardeners. She followed in their 
footsteps and became president of the local garden club. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from old maples, locusts, lilacs and rose bushes, an  
outstanding feature of her landscape is an old well with a massive 
stone superstructure. She said the well has come down in legend as 
supplying water to the whole neighborhood during a serious drought 
around 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	As for period plantings, Ms. Stuart said she thought her parents  
planted things that ``would just make it pleasant'' without 
necessarily considering historical links. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, she thinks, ``We're now going through a cycle in which  
anything that is old is good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Things that our grandmothers grew have come back into style.  
Some are truly beautiful and some we plant because of memories. I 
can't imagine a garden without nasturtiums. And I plant them 
because my mother did it, and my mother did it because my 
grandmother always did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Ms. Cioppa, she said boxwood ``is going to be seen  
increasingly in gardens because the deer don't like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone wanting good descriptions of colonial gardening can find  
them in Ann Leighton's renowned book ``Early American Gardens'' 
(Houghton Mifflin, 1970). 
</P>
<P>
	She lists many of the plants favored at the time and says, ``The  
settlers' gardens probably looked very like English cottage gardens 
of today. ... It was both convenient and necessary to grow as many 
things as possible all together at the same time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, if you want to bask in old vistas you've got to let  
your fancy roam and overlook such distractions as a big oil truck 
pumping fuel into an old house. 
</P>
<P>
	In my town, nostalgics can contemplate two old maple trees that  
stand beside an old house. Legend says they were planted to mark a 
wedding long ago, one tree for the bride and one for the groom. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mollusks Get Experimental Homestead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government biologists want to put more mussel  
into Muscle Shoals. They're ready to reintroduce into the famous 
Alabama riverbeds mollusk species washed out by reservoirs on the 
Ohio, Cumberland and Tennessee rivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Building new homesteads for up to 16 species of endangered  
mussels may sound simple, but they're such complicated creatures 
that researchers spent decades figuring out how to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's 20 years of work that I've been working with these  
animals to get to this point,'' said Richard Biggins, U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service fish and mollusk recovery coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Techniques to move mollusks to a mussel-free portion of the  
Tennessee River were developed by researchers at Virginia 
Polytechnic Institute and Tennessee Technological University, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 34 species of mussels have disappeared from Muscle  
Shoals, a 53-mile stretch of the Tennessee River once thought to 
have the world's greatest collection of freshwater mussels, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dams and reservoirs built in the 1920s and 1930s wrecked mussel  
habitat along the Tennessee and other rivers, covering breeding 
grounds with 20, 30 or 40 feet of calm lake when the creatures 
needed two or three feet of flowing water. The cold reservoir water 
didn't kill the mollusks, but impeded their breeding. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like putting somebody in jail where they couldn't  
reproduce but could live long lives,'' Biggins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some mussels lived 100 years, giving the false impression of  
survival after the damming of the rivers. 
</P>
<P>
	A section of Muscle Shoals in Alabama's Colbert and Lauderdale  
counties, selected as the new home, was part of the historical 
range of the different mussel species but not currently home to any 
of them. That should make it easier to determine the success of the 
human-assisted colonization.

<HEADLINE> Antigay Slur Carved on Student </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- Two prep school students are charged  
with a hate crime for allegedly carving an antigay slur into 
another student's back because he liked to listen to the British 
rock band Queen. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Shapiro, 18, and Matthew Rogers, 20, allegedly used a  
pocket knife to cut ``HOMO'' into the back of a 17-year-old student 
at the Northfield Mount Hermon School. Shapiro was charged 
Wednesday, a day after Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was apparently a disagreement over the style of music he  
liked,'' said Gill Police Chief David Hastings. ``Rogers called it 
a gay band.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastings described the wounds as ``deep enough to draw blood.''  
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw them they were three days old and they were still  
very visible,'' he said. ``The letters were 4- to 5-inches high and 
ran all the way across his back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victim, a junior, did not require hospitalization, and  
initially kept quiet about the May 27 incident. He has since left 
school and returned to his family, Hastings said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro, of Keene, N.H., and Rogers, of Franklin, Tenn., pleaded  
innocent to charges of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, 
assault with intent to maim and assault with intent to intimidate 
resulting in bodily harm. 
</P>
<P>
	The third charge made the incident a hate crime, which would  
require the suspects to undergo counseling and diversity training 
if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Each suspect faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison if  
convicted. Both have been released on bail. Rogers had accepted an 
appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we are able to verify the charges we will have to  
reconsider the appointment,'' said Karen Myers, an academy 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Northfield Mount Hermon, a co-educational school, has 1,139  
students.

<HEADLINE> `Home Improvement' Goes Out on Top / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Home Improvement'' went out on top, but its  
final episode wasn't enough to propel ABC to a weekly win in the 
prime-time ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Allen's farewell was easily last week's most-watched  
program. Much to ABC's surprise and delight, it was the 
fourth-highest rated series finale of the 1990s behind 
``Seinfeld,'' ``Cheers'' and ``The Cosby Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, NBC scored a narrow victory for the week and won the May  
``sweeps'' period, when ratings are watched closely to set local 
advertising rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Home Improvement'' drew an estimated 35.5 million viewers,  
Nielsen Media Research said Wednesday. The final episode of NBC's 
``Mad About You'' was fourth for the week with nearly 20 million 
viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	The finale of Fox's ``Melrose Place'' had a more lackluster  
showing, finishing in 37th place for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one show -- ``Frasier'' -- from NBC's normally powerful  
Thursday night lineup made Nielsen's top 10 for the week. All were 
repeats as the long summer rerun season begins. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, NBC had a 7.8 rating and 14 share. ABC and CBS  
both had 7.5 ratings and 14 shares, though ABC had the edge in 
total viewers. Fox had a 5.7 rating and 11 share, and the WB was at 
3.2 and 6. Struggling UPN had a 1.7 rating and 3 share, while Pax 
TV was at 0.7 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``World News Tonight'' won the evening news competition  
with a 7.1 rating and 17 share. NBC's ``Nightly News'' was at 7.0 
and 16, while the ``CBS Evening News'' was at 5.7 and 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nightly News'' claimed victory during May sweeps, with its  
ratings up slightly from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of May 24-30, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: ``Home Improvement,'' ABC, 21.6; ``Spin City,'' ABC, 
14.3; ``Law and Order,'' NBC, 13.9; ``Mad About You,'' NBC, ``NYPD 
Blue,'' ABC, 13.5; ``Law and Order'' special, NBC, 11.9; ``Dateline 
NBC-Monday,'' NBC, 10.9; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 10.7; ``ABC Monday Night 
Movie: Cleopatra, Part Two,'' ABC, 10.0; ''Ally McBeal,'' Fox, 
10.0.

<HEADLINE> Golfer Fred Couples Seeks Comeback  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) -- In the last year, Fred Couples has gained a  
family and lost the fire that made him one of the top golfers in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	He is back at Muirfield Village Golf Club this week to defend  
his title in the Memorial Tournament. He's talking as if he's more 
homesick than hungry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not into it right now,'' Couples said Wednesday after his  
final tuneup before the Memorial. ``I love playing still. I'm still 
going to play 16 or 18 tournaments. I'm not quitting. I just don't 
feel like going home at this time and beating my brains into the 
ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 39, he says his time is ``semi-passed.''  
</P>
<P>
	Couples married Thais Bren last September. He and her two  
children from a previous marriage live in Pacific Palisades, Calif. 
Two weeks after he met her, she discovered she had breast cancer. 
After weathering months of treatment -- Couples said she's now doing 
fine -- why get panicky over a few hours playing golf for thousands 
of dollars? 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a ball when I go home,'' Couples said. ``I find other  
things to do. ... I have chosen to stick around and have fun, 
because really that's what I want to do. It's a lot of fun to go to 
softball games and to go to soccer games and to the park and to the 
zoo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Couples has never been happier -- and has seldom  
been more erratic in his profession. 
</P>
<P>
	He has played nine tournaments in 1999, has missed two cuts and  
made four top 10s, leaving him 50th on the money list. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played yesterday and today and every shot, you know, it was  
a struggle,'' he said. ``If I don't hit a good one on the 12th 
hole, on the 13th tee I'm thinking of some kind of thought to make 
sure I hit a good one that time. Whereas before, I teed off on 
Thursday and I knew I was going to play well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is a battle that many golfers lose. You can spend all of your  
time with your family and lose your edge, or you can hit thousands 
of balls and lose precious time with your family. A career teeters 
on the brink, with fame and riches on one side and personal 
satisfaction on the other. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of children has made the hours away from home even  
worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never had any kids. I see Jay Haas, I've been to his house  
and I see his son look up at him and say, `Dad, you have to go 
already?''' Couples said. ``That's hard. It's hard for them to 
understand, that I'm in a plane going to another tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couples' solution is to pick his spots.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone says of basketball players that you don't want to get  
to a game until the fourth quarter,'' he said. ``I don't blame 
them. They're out there playing and busting their butts. You do 
that 82 games a year and there's got to be times when you go out 
there and just go through the motions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Golf, he said, is different. But not much.  
</P>
<P>
	``For us, you don't ever want to do that,'' he said. ``Every  
week is very important. I never just want to go like I am now, just 
to show up. That's a waste of your time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couples said he's making the most of his time. In addition to  
defending his title at Muirfield Village Golf Club, he is also 
working on his game for the U.S. Open in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	But winning an Open requires something akin to perfection, at  
least off the tee when the fairways are no wider than a tennis 
court and the rough approaches knee deep. 
</P>
<P>
	``What needs to happen for me is I just have to have everything  
go right,'' Couples said. 
</P>
<P>
	The look on his face said he didn't really believe that was  
likely.

<HEADLINE> Seles Vs. Graf Reignites Rivalry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Monica Seles and Steffi Graf have been down this  
path before -- facing each other on center court at Roland Garros in 
the final stages of the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, they will renew a once-promising rivalry that never  
quite developed when they play in the semifinals of the clay 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Martina Hingis, seeded No. 1, faces defending champion Arantxa  
Sanchez-Vicario in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven years ago, Seles and Graf played one of the more memorable  
French Open finals. Seles won 6-2, 3-6, 10-8 in a classic contest 
that tennis fans hoped would start a rivalry to match Martina 
Navratilova and Chris Evert. 
</P>
<P>
	It never happened and now they meet again, bringing a different  
perspective to the match, 
</P>
<P>
	``It is definitely a match to look forward to,'' Graf said. ``We  
have had a lot of close matches especially at this tournament and 
we had that one memorable match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of matches against Steffi are probably the highlights  
of my career,'' Seles said. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, there's been little separating Seles and Graf.  
</P>
<P>
	In six Grand Slam finals, they have won three each. Overall,  
Graf leads 9-5. In Grand Slam matches, the score is 5-3. But Seles 
has won three of five matches on clay. 
</P>
<P>
	The players last met in the quarterfinals of the 1999 Australian  
Open, when Graf uncharacteristically lost concentration and the 
match, 7-5, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Until that match, Seles hadn't beaten Graf since winning the  
1993 Australian Open final. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Australia I played a good match till a certain point. I  
don't know what happened then, but I could not put a ball in the 
court anymore. I completely flunked,'' Graf said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I lost my concentration in a way that has rarely ever happened  
to me,'' she said. ``I was extremely nervous. I didn't have any 
explanation for it, which made it more difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seles doesn't think that match will have any bearing this time.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's such a different surface here. I just have to be 100  
percent. I did that in Australia. We'll see if I can do it on 
Thursday.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Seles and Graf have had their struggles. A stabbing in 1993 kept  
Seles out of tennis for two years and Graf had knee surgery 
following the French Open two years. That makes matches like 
Thursday's semifinal more meaningful for both of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Seles said she spoke to Graf about it after the Australian Open.  
</P>
<P>
	``Both of us decided to come back because of semifinal and final  
matches, when you have to be 100 percent fit physically, mentally 
and game wise,'' she said. ``The crowd is in it, you are playing 
center court. Those are the times you just love to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among them, Graf, Seles and Sanchez-Vicario have won 11 of the  
last 12 French Open titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis, the only semifinalist looking for a first French Open  
win, has a brilliant record against Sanchez-Vicario. Her 6-4, 6-0, 
win at the German Open last month gave her a 9-1 record, with 
Sanchez-Vicario's sole win coming three years ago, when Hingis was 
15. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis, who has reached at least the semifinal of every Grand  
Slam since the 1996 Wimbledon championship, has an 18-1 record on 
clay this season and is the tournament favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Sanchez-Vicario has played consistently well over the  
last two weeks and hasn't lost at Roland Garros since her defeat to 
Hingis in the 1997 quarterfinals.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Increases U.S. Commitment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AIR FORCE ACADEMY, Colo. (AP) -- President Clinton increased the  
U.S. pledge for a Kosovo peacekeeping force to 7,000 troops 
Wednesday and said America must not grow weary and ``abandon a just 
cause'' in the conflict with Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some things are worth fighting for,'' the president said in a  
commencement address to a new generation of military leaders: the 
804 men and 140 women graduating in the academy's class of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a brilliant sun, the president snapped a salute and shook  
hands with each diploma-clutching graduate in Falcon Stadium. In a 
roaring finale, the Air Force Thunderbird jets roared over the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton announced he was deploying 68 more aircraft, including  
four dozen fighters, for the NATO mission. That will bring the 
total number of U.S. aircraft supporting the airstrikes to 769. 
</P>
<P>
	He also announced the United States would contribute about 7,000  
troops to a 50,000-member NATO peacekeeping force that would enter 
Kosovo as part of a peace settlement to oversee the return of 
hundreds of thousands of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally, the United States had offered to send 4,000  
peacekeepers for a 28,000-member international force, but the U.S. 
commitment was upped as the anticipated peacekeeping needs grew. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton sought to rally support for airstrikes in Yugoslavia as  
polls show declining support for the campaign and an accompanying 
drop in his own job approval rating. His speech came on the eve of 
a White House meeting with the nation's top military leaders to 
discuss the conflict, including the possibility of an eventual 
ground invasion to oust Slobodan Milosevic's forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot grow weary of this campaign because Mr. Milosevic  
didn't capitulate when the first bombs fell,'' the president said 
on the 71st day of airstrikes. ``We cannot abandon a just cause 
because an adversary holds out for more than a few news cycles. I 
reject that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Answering growing criticism of U.S. involvement, Clinton said  
the United States has both a moral and strategic stake in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why are we in Kosovo?'' he asked. ``Because we have a moral  
responsibility to oppose crimes against humanity and mass ethnic 
and religious killing and cleansing where we can,'' the president 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because we have a security responsibility to prevent a wider  
war in Europe, which we know from our two world wars would 
eventually draw America in at far greater cost in lives, time and 
treasure,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton disputed claims that NATO's bombing triggered  
Milosevic's campaign of executions and expulsions of ethnic 
Albanians from Kosovo. He said Milosevic had done the same thing 
earlier in Bosnia and Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ethnic cleansing in Kosovo was not a response to bombing,''  
Clinton said. ``It is the 10-year method of Mr. Milosevic's 
madness. Had we done nothing, the tragedy would have been 
permanent, accepted and, in effect, condoned by the world 
community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Expressing determination to prevail, Clinton said, ``We have  
acted quickly to end this horror and that is exactly what we will 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If NATO had failed to act, Clinton said, ``Slobodan Milosevic  
would then have become a model of success for 21st century rulers 
trying to obliterate multiethnic societies, instead of the symbol 
of bankrupt policies based on hate that we want to confine to the 
dustbin of history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton singled out for recognition two academy alumni flying  
Kosovo missions -- a B-2 bomber pilot and a C-130 cargo plane pilot. 
They stood, to cheers, but were not named because they are still 
flying missions in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the U.S.  
contribution to a peacekeeping force probably would include three 
armor battalions from the 1st Infantry Division, nicknamed the 
``Big Red One, in Germany, which would translate to roughly 3,000 
soldiers with tanks and other heavy armor; several battalions of 
Army engineers; an aviation group with transport and attack 
helicopters; a military police battalion and an artillery 
battalion.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Down 18.37 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed Wednesday as investors  
prepared themselves for a possible increase in interest rates but 
nonetheless went in search of bargains in the battered technology 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 18.37 to close at  
10,577.89. The index dropped as much as 131.40 earlier in the 
session before erasing most of the losses in the final hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were slightly higher after paring big  
losses. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 0.55 to 1,294.81, and the 
technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index rose 20.38 to 2,432.41. 
</P>
<P>
	An afternoon speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan  
helped calm a jittery market. The influential policy-maker kept his 
remarks at an international business conference in Boston tightly 
focused on trade, and did not address interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The market has been rattled for more than two weeks by  
persistent fears that the Fed will raise rates this summer, hoping 
to cool off the booming economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest bull market in history has been aided and abetted  
by a friendly Fed,'' said Larry Wachtel, a market analyst at 
Prudential Securities. ``Everyone is afraid of what will happen if 
the Fed turns unfriendly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Dow remained in a narrow trading range throughout  
Greenspan's speech, market watchers strained to catch any hints he 
might offer about the Fed's future course. Alan Skrainka, chief 
market strategist at Edward Jones of St. Louis, said many expect 
the Fed to raise interest rates when its Open Market Committee 
meets June 29. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed doesn't want to shock the system, so Greenspan's  
lieutenants have been warming us up for a while,'' he said. 
``People are selling on the rumor of a rate hike, so they may buy 
when the news hits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wachtel said the market is likely to remain off-balance at least  
until Friday, when the Labor Department reports May's unemployment 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the emotional component of that report, there won't be  
any real direction until then,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices continued their tumble after a robust report on new  
home sales. The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond 
recovered slightly by the afternoon and yielded 5.93 percent, but 
the yield had soared to 5.97 in earlier trading. 
</P>
<P>
	A yield of 6 percent is viewed as a critical point for stocks,  
because at that level, higher yields make bonds a more attractive 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest rate worries depressed bank and financial stocks, with  
J.P. Morgan falling 2 5/8 to 130 7/8. The financial sector is especially 
vulnerable to higher interest rates because lending volume shrinks 
when it becomes more expensive to borrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Investment firms, including online brokerages, also fell on  
interest rate concerns. DLJ Direct was down 5 1/8 to 33 5/8. Analysts 
said Merrill Lynch's announcement Tuesday that it plans an online 
service put additional pressure on the brokerage sector. Merrill 
Lynch itself was down 4 9/16 to 70 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology companies began the day by tumbling yet again, but  
their weakened prices enticed some buyers later in the session. 
Intel, which has slipped amid concerns about its earnings outlook, 
rose 1 1/4 to 51 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! rose 4 5/16 to 142 1/2, buoyed by the news that Sprint  
Corp.'s PCS Group will offer Yahoo! content to users of its 
wireless phones. 
</P>
<P>
	Bookseller Barnes &AMP; Noble rose 1 1/4 to 28 5/8 after it called off its  
planned acquisition of book distributor Ingram Book Group. The 
company's online wing, barnesandnoble.com, fell 2 13/16 to 17 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume totaled 877.17 
million shares, compared with 824.34 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 0.78 to 620.50, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 4.88 to 771.23. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.72 to 436.74.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.06 percent.  
Germany's DAX index rose 0.6 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 gained 
0.8 percent, and France's CAC-40 ended nearly flat, just 1.65 
points higher than Wednesday's close.

<HEADLINE> Athletes Want Bigger IOC Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- As the International Olympic  
Committee opened debate on possible reforms, athletes made forceful 
arguments for being given decision-making roles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will the IOC, who claim that the Olympics are for the  
athletes, support the athletes, empower the athletes, give them 
full status in the Olympic family?'' said Johann Olav Koss, the 
Norwegian speedskater who won three gold medals at the 1994 
Lillehammer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's not about the athletes,'' Koss said, ``then what is it  
about?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koss sits on the IOC athletes' commission, the only IOC panel  
with democratically elected members. He and the nine other member 
athletes are serving on IOC 2000, an reform commission set up in 
the wake of the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech at the opening session Tuesday, Koss proposed that  
10 more athletes be elected to the athletes' commission and that 
all 20 be appointed members of a restructured IOC. He suggested 
that two athletes serve on the powerful IOC executive board. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are the most legitimate people in the IOC,'' said Algerian  
runner Hassiba Boulmerka, the women's 1,500-meter gold medalist at 
the 1992 Barcelona Games. ``We were elected. We should have the 
most power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boulmerka said the selection of Olympic host cities should be  
based on site visits by those who will be competing there, not by 
``an institution of elderly men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to have the same problems of Atlanta (in 1996),  
where athletes suffered from the heat and heavy security,'' she 
said. ``We want to choose the best sites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the IOC has dozens of former Olympians among its ranks,  
the athletes stressed the need for current or recently retired 
competitors to serve on the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Ctvrtlik, who played on three U.S. Olympic volleyball teams,  
said athletes ``do have a voice, but it's a small voice. If we are 
to have a role as a third pillar in the Olympic movement, we have a 
long way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC 2000 is examining ways of reshaping the IOC's structure and  
the process for selecting Olympic host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was among several  
speakers who called on the IOC to be more open, accountable and 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
	But the opening session was tempered by words of caution, with  
delegates warning against radical change in a 105-year-old 
organization, which has endured world wars, terrorism and boycotts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main theme was there should more of an evolution, not a  
revolution,'' IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber said. ``We 
need to adapt and to update the structure of the IOC -- not destroy 
and rebuild it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission is expected to consider changes to the way IOC  
members are selected, including introducing term limits and 
reducing the mandatory retirement age, which is now 80. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, which is divided into three working groups, is  
to submit a preliminary report June 20 at the next IOC general 
assembly in Seoul, South Korea. Final recommendations are scheduled 
to be adopted at a special IOC session in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Consensus on some issues might be hard to reach. Ctvrtlik said  
there were ``probably 50-60 divergent views'' expressed during the 
working group meeting on the site-selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC Sports and an IOC 2000  
member, said American athletes were suffering from ``cynical ... 
self-serving'' attacks on the IOC by John Hancock insurance 
president David D'Alessandro. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro, whose company is a top-level Olympic sponsor, said  
Ebersol was concerned that the scandal would devalue his network's 
$3.5 billion Olympics rights package. 
</P>
<P>
	--Australian IOC member Phil Coles said he would have a lot to  
present in his defense during today's appearance before a special 
panel investigating charges of ethical misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, who denies any wrongdoing, could be expelled from the IOC  
if the panel concludes he abused his position. Most recently, he 
has faced allegations that he passed memos and evaluations of other 
IOC members to Salt Lake City's bid team.

<HEADLINE> EU Ministers Insist on Doping Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PADERBORN, Germany (AP) -- European Union sports ministers  
remained on a collision course with some major sports by insisting 
Wednesday on a two-year ban for first-time doping offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	A joint statement issued after a two-day informal meeting of the  
15 ministers said a planned worldwide anti-doping agency should be 
independent and empowered to impose sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Otto Schily, Germany's interior minister and chairman of the  
meeting, said the ministers had agreed about the two-year ban, 
although he conceded that there could be legal problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``An international system of sanctions is needed, such as a  
minimum ban of two years for first-time offenders,'' Schily said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have to check it legally though,'' Schily said. ``Our  
goal remains to have a strict and hard punishment for doping 
violations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several major sports, such as soccer, cycling and tennis, are  
opposed to a two-year ban, arguing that such a punishment for a 
first offense would never hold up to challenges under right-to-work 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Schily met later in the day with Sepp Blatter, president of  
FIFA, soccer's world governing body, and the two men indicated a 
possible compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are differences of opinion on the legal interpretation  
of the minimum punishment,'' Schily said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we've agreed that these differences should be examined by  
a panel of international experts,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blatter said FIFA must be flexible.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to set up in-training controls through our  
national federations and perhaps impose punishments that would go 
beyond the minimum two-year ban,'' Blatter told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting in Lausanne in February, the 15 EU governments and  
the International Olympic Committee failed to agree on an 
anti-doping program. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU governments refused to allow the IOC a lead role in the  
proposed anti-doping agency, which would supervise worldwide drug 
testing and policy and have an initial budget of $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint statement said it would be ``desirable'' for the  
agency to be based in one of the EU capitals and not in Lausanne, 
which also serves as the seat of the IOC.

	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- American Airlines pilot Richard  
Buschmann had been on duty for 13 1/2 hours as he tried to land in a 
severe thunderstorm. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Buschmann, who had significant experience with MD-80 jets,  
was nearing his maximum of roughly 14 hours on duty when the plane 
skidded off an Arkansas runway shortly before midnight Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet crashed against a light tower at the Little Rock airport  
and burst into flames, killing nine people. 
</P>
<P>
	American's chief pilot, Cecil Ewell, said such long days and  
difficult flying conditions are not talked about often, but are not 
infrequent for airline pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are the kinds of things you don't hear about. These guys  
work very hard,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buschmann was the airline's chief pilot in Chicago, with 9,600  
flight hours and 5,500 flight hours on MD-80s, the same class as 
the MD-82 twin-engine jet that crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	His experience qualified him to check other American pilots on  
their handling of that aircraft, American spokeswoman Andrea Rader 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both he and the other pilot in the cockpit, First Officer  
Michael Origel, were nearing their federally regulated maximum of 
roughly 14 hours when the plane crashed. Their scheduled 11-hour 
day, with 3 flights, ran long because of delays, including 
thunderstorms in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they couldn't get to Little Rock within the limits, we  
never would have sent them,'' said Bob Baker, executive vice 
president of flight operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Origel, who escaped with a broken leg, joined Fort Worth,  
Texas-based American in February and was based in Chicago. In bad 
weather, the first officer's responsibility would have been manning 
the radios to get weather reports from the airport control tower. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the four flight attendants also were injured. Nancy Luna  
suffered a fractured pelvis and Jennifer Chapman broke her leg.

<HEADLINE> Another Lawsuit Against Dennis Rodman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Dennis Rodman is being sued again.  
</P>
<P>
	A Kentucky woman has filed suit against the flamboyant former  
NBA player, claiming he assaulted her in the lobby of a Las Vegas 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in state District Court by Rebecca  
Mardis of Laurel County, Ky., is the latest of several filed 
against Rodman in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Mardis alleges Rodman slammed her camera to the floor and lifted  
her into the air in a threatening manner, then laughed at her 
fright. The suit alleges it took place in January in the lobby of 
the MGM Grand Hotel when she tried to take his photo. 
</P>
<P>
	Messages to Rodman's representative at International Creative  
Management were not immediately returned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mardis seeks $1 million in punitive damages because she alleges  
Rodman has a history of assaulting people. In her lawsuit, Mardis 
alleges assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional 
distress and property damage. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 19, a casino security guard sued Rodman, accusing him of  
grabbing her breast while she was working at the Las Vegas Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
	Three lawsuits filed in Las Vegas in June 1998 involve other  
allegations about Rodman's behavior in casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	A Las Vegas Hilton employee accused him of grabbing her and  
lifting her off the ground in April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	A Las Vegas woman accused Rodman of sexually assaulting her in  
April 1998 at the Las Vegas Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
	A craps dealer at The Mirage filed a lawsuit alleging Rodman  
humiliated him at work by rubbing his groin and head. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman played for the Detroit Pistons and Chicago Bulls before  
joining the Los Angeles Lakers for a short stint this year. The 
Lakers waived him in April.

<HEADLINE> Seles Vs. Graf Reignites Rivalry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Monica Seles and Steffi Graf have been down this  
path before -- facing each other on center court at Roland Garros in 
the final stages of the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, they will renew a once-promising rivalry that never  
quite developed when they play in the semifinals of the clay 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Martina Hingis, seeded No. 1, faces defending champion Arantxa  
Sanchez-Vicario in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven years ago, Seles and Graf played one of the more memorable  
French Open finals. Seles won 6-2, 3-6, 10-8 in a classic contest 
that tennis fans hoped would start a rivalry to match Martina 
Navratilova and Chris Evert. 
</P>
<P>
	It never happened and now they meet again, bringing a different  
perspective to the match, 
</P>
<P>
	``It is definitely a match to look forward to,'' Graf said. ``We  
have had a lot of close matches especially at this tournament and 
we had that one memorable match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of matches against Steffi are probably the highlights  
of my career,'' Seles said. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, there's been little separating Seles and Graf.  
</P>
<P>
	In six Grand Slam finals, they have won three each. Overall,  
Graf leads 9-5. In Grand Slam matches, the score is 5-3. But Seles 
has won three of five matches on clay. 
</P>
<P>
	The players last met in the quarterfinals of the 1999 Australian  
Open, when Graf uncharacteristically lost concentration and the 
match, 7-5, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Until that match, Seles hadn't beaten Graf since winning the  
1993 Australian Open final. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Australia I played a good match till a certain point. I  
don't know what happened then, but I could not put a ball in the 
court anymore. I completely flunked,'' Graf said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I lost my concentration in a way that has rarely ever happened  
to me,'' she said. ``I was extremely nervous. I didn't have any 
explanation for it, which made it more difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seles doesn't think that match will have any bearing this time.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's such a different surface here. I just have to be 100  
percent. I did that in Australia. We'll see if I can do it on 
Thursday.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Seles and Graf have had their struggles. A stabbing in 1993 kept  
Seles out of tennis for two years and Graf had knee surgery 
following the French Open two years. That makes matches like 
Thursday's semifinal more meaningful for both of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Seles said she spoke to Graf about it after the Australian Open.  
</P>
<P>
	``Both of us decided to come back because of semifinal and final  
matches, when you have to be 100 percent fit physically, mentally 
and game wise,'' she said. ``The crowd is in it, you are playing 
center court. Those are the times you just love to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among them, Graf, Seles and Sanchez-Vicario have won 11 of the  
last 12 French Open titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis, the only semifinalist looking for a first French Open  
win, has a brilliant record against Sanchez-Vicario. Her 6-4, 6-0, 
win at the German Open last month gave her a 9-1 record, with 
Sanchez-Vicario's sole win coming three years ago, when Hingis was 
15. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis, who has reached at least the semifinal of every Grand  
Slam since the 1996 Wimbledon championship, has an 18-1 record on 
clay this season and is the tournament favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Sanchez-Vicario has played consistently well over the  
last two weeks and hasn't lost at Roland Garros since her defeat to 
Hingis in the 1997 quarterfinals.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Olympics Report Details Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Atlanta Olympic officials acknowledged Wednesday  
that they dispensed gifts and favors to try to land the 1996 Games, 
including a $25,000 donation to a South African anti-apartheid 
group and a used bus that was sent to Peru. 
</P>
<P>
	The gifts were detailed in an internal report that was given to  
the House Commerce Committee on Tuesday. It includes numerous 
examples of gifts to International Olympic Committee members or 
their families that exceeded the IOC's $200 limit. 
</P>
<P>
	The report did not suggest any laws were broken.  
</P>
<P>
	Other gifts included $30,000 in sports equipment and  
infrastructure to the Republic of Congo and about $15,000 for two 
teen-age tennis players from the African nation to attend an 
exclusive tennis camp in Florida. Both gifts were in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The House committee is looking into Atlanta's successful bid for  
the 1996 Summer Games while it investigates the bribery scandal 
surrounding the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City. The Salt Lake 
scandal includes allegations of scholarships, medical care and job 
offers for IOC members and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Payne, who headed Atlanta's effort to land the Olympics,  
dismissed most of the violations off as minor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've established in this report that we've acted with  
integrity and honesty,'' he said. ``In fact, most of the issues we 
discuss in our report were conducted with goodwill and humanitarian 
goals in mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest beneficiary was the Republic of Congo. Gifts were  
provided at the request of the country's Jean-Claude Ganga, one of 
six IOC members expelled after the Salt Lake scandal, according to 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Young, the former Atlanta mayor and one of the leaders of  
Atlanta's campaign, said Ganga never made any requests for himself 
but was looking out for his country and for other African 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The amounts of assistance involved were really  
insignificant,'' Young said. He said IOC investigators have ``been 
unfair by holding representatives from struggling, strife-ridden 
countries up to the same standard as, say, England or France.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta campaign violated the $200 limit on individual gifts  
38 times, according to the report. Four gifts exceeded $500, 
including a live bulldog that cost $875 and a $948 carburetor kit. 
</P>
<P>
	Another donation included a $25,000 gift to the South African  
Non-Racial Olympic Committee, an anti-apartheid organization 
seeking to get South Africa back into the Olympics. And the Atlanta 
group sent a used bus worth $10,310 to Lima, Peru and a fast-food 
chain eventually paid for the bus. 
</P>
<P>
	The report shows six IOC members brought two or more companions  
on trips to Atlanta that were financed by the Atlanta group. IOC 
rules limit members to one companion on such trips. 
</P>
<P>
	In several instances, IOC members showed up with children or  
other family members, Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just Southern hospitality,'' he said. ``It wasn't like  
we were going to turn them away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report was compiled by the Georgia Amateur Athletic  
Foundation, which oversaw the formation of Atlanta Committee for 
the Olympic Games. It holds about 1,400 boxes of records that 
include the history of the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., chairman of the subcommittee heading  
the investigation, said that he was glad to get the report but that 
investigators will be in Atlanta as early as Thursday to look 
through the rest of the city's Olympic records.

<HEADLINE> Grain Storage Bins Full / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Less than three weeks from the start of  
wheat harvest, Duane Boyd uneasily takes stock of his bulging grain 
bins at the Offerle Co-op in southwest Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	By this time, the soybean crop should have been gone, but he  
still has half of it left in storage at the elevator. And he has 
too much corn, too much milo and even too much of last year's wheat 
still in the bins. 
</P>
<P>
	Not enough room for the new crop, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have less space available this year than we did last year,  
and a lot of that is due to larger carryover of corn and milo 
stocks, plus additional stocks of wheat that hasn't been sold from 
the previous year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, Boyd would have just 15 percent of the corn and milo  
crop still in the elevator by this date. But he has closer to 35 
percent of those crops still in the bins, and no prospects of 
selling much of it before the local wheat harvest begins around 
June 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have just about all the space made that I can make right  
now,'' Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	He figured that even if the wheat harvest comes in at 15 percent  
less than last year, he will still have to scramble to find another 
terminal to take 300,000 to 400,000 bushels of wheat, which doesn't 
store very well on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Salina, Chuck Elsea at Scoular Grain Co. said his  
elevator has plenty of room for this year's wheat harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We worked pretty hard beginning back in February to get  
ourselves ready for harvest,'' Elsea said. ``We are there now. We 
have more room than a year ago. We are ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And at the Collingwood grain elevator outside Hutchinson, wheat  
trader Brian Simpson said grain stocks are a little higher than 
last year because of carryovers in the market, ``but we feel pretty 
comfortable about taking wheat stocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just where the state stands in grain stocks still in storage  
won't be known officially until the end of June, when Kansas 
Agricultural Statistics compiles its quarterly grain stocks report. 
By that time, the Kansas winter wheat harvest will be in full 
swing. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas is going into the 1999 wheat harvest with a 60 million to  
80 million bushels worth of new storage space added in the past 12 
months, said Tom Tunnell, president of the Kansas Feed and Grain 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are rapidly constructing new bins, and anything that  
can be brought out of mothballs has been retrofitted and brought 
back,'' Tunnell said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past few years, grain storage shortages have surfaced  
mostly in the fall, when the harvests for corn, milo and soybean 
are brought in. Low prices and a weak export market have just 
aggravated the situation as farmers hang onto larger than usual 
grain stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our real problem is going to come between wheat  
harvest and fall harvest, when we are kind of looking at ideal 
conditions for those crops,'' Boyd said. ``If they come in real 
strong, we almost have to empty our elevator in three months to 
make room for milo, corn and beans.''

<HEADLINE> Oprah's Lawyer Opposes Beef Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Lawyers for Oprah Winfrey say cattlemen who  
sued the talk show host should not be allowed to retry their claims 
in state court. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a federal jury in Amarillo, Texas, ruled Ms. Winfrey  
did not defame the beef industry when a guest on her show in 1996 
said there was a risk U.S. beef could spread mad cow disease. 
</P>
<P>
	But the case should never have been tried in federal court,  
Joseph F. Coyne Jr., an attorney representing cattleman Paul 
Engler, told the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Winfrey's attorney, Charles Babcock, argued the verdict  
should be upheld and the case shouldn't go back to state court for 
a retrial. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only now that they lost the jury verdict ... that they  
are coming back and saying the court doesn't have jurisdiction,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal appeals court did not immediately rule at the  
hearing, which Ms. Winfrey did not attend.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Aussies Wary on Olympic Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee  
scandal has resulted in 14 percent of Australians being less 
positive towards sponsors for the Sydney 2000 Olympic games, 
according to a survey. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, published in The Australian newspaper on Thursday, was  
conducted from May 28-30 and surveyed 1,200 people over 18 years 
old in all Australian states. The results were weighted to reflect 
the population distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey has a margin of error of 5 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	While the poll shows an 80 percent majority of those surveyed  
feel the same about sponsors, the number less positive towards them 
was 14 percent, against 3 percent who are more positive. 
</P>
<P>
	Carden Calder, Olympic communications manager with Australian  
torch relay sponsor AMP, played down the results, saying Sydney's 
construction-zone existence also could have led to declining 
attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
	``If sponsors have strong commercial programs in place, they  
have nothing to worry about,'' Calder said. 
</P>
<P>
	Figures showing general attitudes to the Olympics also show a  
significant number of people are more negative about the Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll showed 71 percent of people have the same attitude in  
the wake of the scandals, 22 percent less positive and 5 percent a 
more positive attitude about the Olympics.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Speaks at NYC Graduation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As she edges closer to a run for the Senate,  
Hillary Rodham Clinton told City College graduates today that they 
should be wary of those who criticize schools ``to score political 
points'' -- a subtle jab at a potential Republican rival. 
</P>
<P>
	``Run, Hillary, run,'' the graduates exhorted Mrs. Clinton, who  
aides say is virtually certain to seek the Senate seat being 
vacated by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton called for investing in early childhood education,  
rebuilding crumbling schools and raising educational standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can do this if instead of pointing fingers we roll up our  
sleeves and pledge to work together,'' she told the 3,000 graduates 
and their families who gathered in the open-air Lewisohn Plaza at 
the Harlem campus. 
</P>
<P>
	She said that criticism of the schools should be used ``not just  
to score political points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can never lift up our public schools by tearing them down  
and undermining the public education system that is at the very 
foundation of the American dream,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	She did not mention a potential Republican rival for Senate,  
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, by name, but Giuliani has been embroiled in 
a very public debate with Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew over the 
state of city school system. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady held a round of campaign staff interviews at the  
White House on Tuesday. Aides said Mrs. Clinton would notify New 
York Rep. Nita Lowey, a Democrat who was considering the race 
herself, of her plans sometime in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring a ``dramatic change of heart,'' Mrs. Clinton will run,  
said one aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a purple graduation gown, Mrs. Clinton today was awarded  
the City College President's Medal for championing women's rights 
and children's and educational issues. 
</P>
<P>
	When she mentioned her recent visit to Macedonia to visit ethnic  
Albanian refugees from Kosovo, several dozen graduates lifted a 
huge banner and began chanting, ``Stop the War.'' Mrs. Clinton 
continued without comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd was otherwise jubilant at Mrs. Clinton's appearance,  
at times chanting, ``Run, Hillary, run.'' As she walked through 
their ranks to the podium, many gave her impromptu hugs and reached 
over to shake her hand. 
</P>
<P>
	One graduate had written, ``It takes a village,'' a reference to  
Mrs. Clinton's book, on the inside of her mortarboard. Later in her 
speech, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged the student's message and noted 
that many of the graduates had reached their educational goals with 
help from their families and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was also scheduled to attend a Democratic Party  
luncheon honoring the president of a powerful local teachers' union 
and an evening fund-raising reception for Rep. Carolyn Maloney, 
D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the first lady's Senate designs, Lowey spokesman Howard  
Wolfson said Tuesday the congresswoman had not been notified. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not aware of any decision having been made,'' Wolfson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior adviser to the first lady who is involved in her  
deliberations said she is close to finalizing her decision to run. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said Mrs. Clinton seemed even more likely to run  
after spending the Memorial Day weekend with her husband in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	For the record, Mrs. Clinton's spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, said:  
``Nothing has changed except that they are back from vacation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady met Tuesday at the White House with potential  
campaign workers, including Hank Morris, a New York consultant 
coming off Chuck Schumer's victorious 1998 Senate campaign to 
unseat Republican incumbent Alfonse D'Amato; and Gabrielle 
Fialkoff, who was the chief fund-raiser for New York City Council 
Speaker Peter Vallone's unsuccessful gubernatorial bid last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of Mrs. Clinton's friends and advisers said they expect  
the next step in her deliberative move toward a campaign to be the 
announcement of a formal exploratory committee. That likely won't 
occur until Mrs. Clinton returns from foreign travel set for June 
15-30. She is scheduled to travel through Europe with President 
Clinton to the summit of G-8 leaders in Germany, and then split off 
for a solo tour through Israel, Jordan and Morocco.

<HEADLINE> Potential Violations in Atlanta Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Details of potential violations by Atlanta officials bidding for  
the 1996 Olympics, included in a report released Wednesday by the 
Georgia Amateur Athletic Foundation: 

</P>
<P>
	Thirty-eight violations of the $200 individual gift limit,  
including: 
</P>
<P>
	--$948 for a carburetor kit for an unknown type car for Bashir  
Mohamed Attarabulsi, the IOC member from Libya. Attarabulsi has 
since resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	--$875 for a bulldog for Manuel Gonzalez Guerra of Cuba.  
</P>
<P>
	--$616.25 for a Tiffany jewelry box to IOC executive committee  
member Kim Un-yong of Korea, who has been censured by the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	--$318 for a set of surgical instruments for Camaroon's Rene  
Essomba. 
</P>
<P>
	--$474.88 for a ruby pin for Ecuador's Agustin Arroyo.  
</P>
<P>
	--$457.24 for a Steuben crystal sailboat sculpture for Finland's  
Peter Tallberg. 
</P>
<P>
	--$540.58 for clothing and $397.08 for a sweater for Finland's  
Pirjo Haeggman, who has since resigned from the IOC. 

</P>
<P>
	Six violations of the rule limiting IOC members to one companion  
per official visit: 
</P>
<P>
	--Seuili Paul Wallwork of Western Samoa, two companions in

<P>
	Storms that spawned killer tornadoes in Illinois and Oklahoma  
were continuing this morning in the Midwest, bringing more damaging 
winds, hail and rain to the sodden region. 
</P>
<P>
	Showers and thunderstorms were hanging along a stationary front  
in the Midwest, bringing hail and high winds to Illinois, Iowa, and 
Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen tornadoes were reported Tuesday and early  
today in central and southern Illinois. One blew railroad cars off 
a track near Carlinville, between Springfield and St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Another ripped through a rest stop in Farmersville, Ill.,  
Tuesday evening, killing a trucker who was apparently asleep inside 
his rig when it blew over, crushing him, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	In eastern Oklahoma, a woman died when a twister hit two  
communities on the eastern shore of Fort Gibson Lake just north of 
Sequoyah State Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Storms were expected to continue, with winds reaching 60 mph, in  
parts of Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Scattered showers were also possible in the northern Plains,  
while partly cloudy skies and a chance of showers and storms were 
forecast for the southern Plains, particularly eastern Texas and 
central and east Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	A cold front stretching from the Great Lakes region to New  
England was pushing light to moderate showers into Maine, Vermont, 
New Hampshire, Massachusetts and New York. Forecasters predicted 
the front would stall this morning, keeping the wet weather in the 
Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	High pressure was bringing clear to partly cloudy skies in the  
mid-Atlantic states and the Southeast, where typical warm-weather 
afternoon storms were possible. Mild storms in southern Florida 
were expected to die out this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Clouds and scattered showers covered the Pacific Northwest due  
to a stationary front across central Montana, Idaho and southern 
Oregon. Rain also was falling this morning in Nevada and central 
California, and clouds were gathering in the desert Southwest due 
to a low off the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Highs today were expected in the 90s in parts of Florida, Texas  
and the desert Southwest; the 80s from the East Coast through the 
Southeast and mid-South to the central and northern Plains; the 60s

<HEADLINE> Lewises Enjoy Ride With Charismatic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Bob Lewis will always remember  
Charismatic, whether or not the colt makes Triple Crown history 
with a victory in the Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The horse bit the hand that buys his feed when Lewis visited  
Charismatic in the barn after the Preakness Stakes. Ten stitches 
and a few laughs later, Lewis says, ``I just keep my hands to 
myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis and his wife, Beverly, bought Charismatic for $200,000. He  
could turn out to be their best investment in nine years of owning 
horses. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second time in three years, racing's favorite senior  
citizens own another horse with a chance to become the 12th Triple 
Crown winner in history. If Charismatic should win Saturday, Bob, 
75, and Beverly, 72, don't believe it would change their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be fun,'' he said. ``It would be another milestone.''  
</P>
<P>
	After the Preakness last month, the Lewises returned to their  
harbor-front home on Lido Isle across a bridge from Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	On a table behind the floral sofa in the living room are the  
trophies won by Silver Charm in the 1997 Kentucky Derby and 
Preakness. His Triple Crown bid fell short when the colt lost by 
three-quarters of a length in the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	That year, the Lewises chartered a plane to New York for more  
than 100 friends, many of whom cried when Silver Charm lost. Bob 
Lewis didn't like the reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of gave my old first sergeant approach,'' the former  
World War II platoon sergeant said, ``and had them snap to and told 
them, `This isn't the end of the world for God's sakes. We just 
lost a horse race and I'm sure we're going to lose a lot more.''' 
</P>
<P>
	His pep talk worked. The group went back to their hotel and  
partied. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewises are unlike many big-time owners. They didn't grow up  
around horses, have sat on the animals only twice in their lives, 
and aren't diehard gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Love the horses, love seeing the race,'' said Bob Lewis, who  
when he was 10 years old accompanied his parents to Santa Anita on 
the first Saturday the track was open in 1934. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, who started out as a beer sales representative, earned  
his wealth as founder of Foothill Beverage Co., one of the largest 
Anheuser-Busch distributors in the country. He remains chairman, 
and his oldest son is general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, the Lewises bought their first two thoroughbreds.  
Success wasn't far behind. They won their first race and had their 
first stakes winner that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Their champions include Timber Country, winner of the 1995  
Preakness, and filly Serena's Song, who won several Grade I stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	After Charismatic won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, the  
couple watched two of their 55 horses currently in training win at 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``It almost gets to a point where it's a little embarrassing,''  
Lewis said. ``We kind of backed into the winners' circle. Maybe 
somebody up there was going to boo us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don't bet on it.  
</P>
<P>
	Chris Antley, who rides Charismatic, said the Lewises remind him  
of Chip and Dale, the upbeat Disney cartoon chipmunks who 
constantly look out for each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're always happy,'' Antley said. ``They're always  
shoulder-length apart. If he turns to the left, she turns to the 
left behind him. They're about as true a people as you would ever 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The couple met at the University of Oregon, where Bob asked  
Beverly out for a beer after she auditioned for the pep squad. 
Their horses race in the university's green-and-gold colors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went along not for the beer but for the nice young man who  
invited me out,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	They married in 1947 and honeymooned at Del Mar race track.  
Fifty years later, they returned to the seaside track for their 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple isn't overly sentimental about their horses. Lewis  
insists they are business investments, not family members. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't you believe he's not emotional,'' Mrs. Lewis told a  
visitor. ``I've never seen him so out of control at the 
Preakness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't get nervous at all until the race has ended,'' he  
said. ``After the Preakness, I was trembling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Trembling and yelling,'' she added. ``My legs turned to  
noodles. It's draining.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the celebratory rush after Charismatic won the Kentucky  
Derby, Mrs. Lewis forgot to cash her ticket. Liking the 31-1 odds 
on her horse, she bet $20 across the board. The payoff was more 
than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never made so much on a ticket in my life,'' she said,  
smiling. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the same friends who supported the Lewises two years ago  
in New York are coming in again. The couple won't cry in their beer 
if Charismatic loses. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the fifth day of June isn't our day, we'll have one less  
trophy sitting on the bar,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Nuke Treaty Remains in Senate Limbo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If ratified, a nuclear test ban treaty that  
has languished before the Senate for 20 months could make it harder 
for China to advance its acquired nuclear-weapons capacity, 
arms-control advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
	But the pact -- the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty --  
remains caught in a dispute between the Clinton administration and 
the Republican-led Senate over modifications to an earlier 
arms-control agreement, the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., has refused to schedule hearings on  
the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty until the administration 
sends the ABM amendments to the Senate for ratification. Helms had 
given the White House until Tuesday to submit the ABM legislation -- 
threatening to put a freeze on all treaties if it failed to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABM modifications, which concern how the treaty affects  
other former Soviet republics as well as Russia, were agreed to by 
Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin. But the administration 
doesn't want to submit them to the Senate until the Russian 
parliament ratifies a later arms control regimen -- the so-called 
START II treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	With US-Russian relations strained by NATO's bombing in  
Yugoslavia, the Russian Duma does not seem inclined to act soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation has been thrown off course by the Kosovo  
operation,'' said a senior White House official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. ``We intend to try to put the arms control 
track back in gear with the Russians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials fear that Helms and other Senate  
conservatives will use the delay to pull the United States out of 
the ABM treaty entirely. Helms has said the 1972 treaty belongs in 
the ``dust bin of history'' because the Soviet Union no longer 
exists. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democratic supporters of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban  
Treaty have hinted that they may use procedural devices in the 
Senate this month to pressure Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., to put the treaty on the agenda this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-S.D., said he and the others would ``speak  
with some aggressiveness on this issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty -- which obligates its signatories not to carry out  
any nuclear weapons test explosions -- sets a September 1999 
deadline for winning ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	But neither the Senate GOP leadership nor the administration  
seemed ready to budge. 
</P>
<P>
	Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Coalition to Reduce  
Nuclear Dangers, an umbrella group of the 17 largest 
nonproliferation organizations, said the Comprehensive Nuclear Test 
Ban Treaty ``is one of the few tools that is available to the 
United States to prevent China from conducting nuclear tests on its 
warhead designs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``How helpful is it to national security to delay consideration  
of a treaty that's been in the Senate for 20 months now?'' Kimball 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty has been signed by 152 countries, including Russia  
and China. But only 29 have ratified it. And of those, only two are 
nuclear powers: Britain and France. To take effect, all 44 nations 
with nuclear technology must ratify the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	China held its last underground nuclear test in 1996 and then  
declared a moratorium on nuclear testing. It has given no 
indication that it will resume testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, many treaty advocates claim the Senate delay is keeping  
other nations from ratifying the treaty. They say this is 
especially important given last year's nuclear tests by India and 
Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty would set up a worldwide monitoring system.  
</P>
<P>
	``These are not salad days for arms control,'' said Chris  
Madison, a spokesman for Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware. Biden, the 
senior Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, is leading the 
charge for the treaty but has been frustrated by Helms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will do everything within my power to ensure that the ABM  
treaty is never resurrected or reconstituted,'' Helms said last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the administration contends the ABM treaty ``remains  
in force'' with Russia, even though the Soviet Union no longer 
exists, the official said.

<HEADLINE> `NewsHour' Plans New Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The team behind public television's ``NewsHour  
with Jim Lehrer'' hopes to begin a second national newscast to 
compete with local late-night news shows early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, about a dozen PBS stations have agreed to air the show,  
which is being developed with The New York Times, said Robert 
MacNeil, the former ``NewsHour'' anchor who is working on it for 
MacNeil-Lehrer Productions. 
</P>
<P>
	MacNeil said the second newscast will provide a substantive  
alternative to the ``body bag'' journalism of late-night local news 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	MacNeil and Lehrer, his former partner, received Quinnipiac  
College's Fred Friendly First Amendment Award on Wednesday for 
their nightly newscast, which celebrates its 25th anniversary next 
year. MacNeil retired from the show in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Accepting their awards, both men sharply denounced TV networks  
for viewing news as entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	The late Friendly, the former CBS News president and Columbia  
University professor who helped put MacNeil and Lehrer together as 
a team, would be appalled at many news programs today, Lehrer said. 
</P>
<P>
	With their opinionated reporters, invasions of privacy and  
public leering, many news shows resemble professional wrestling, 
Lehrer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people are on to what's going on in television  
news,'' he said, ``and television news is either going to change or 
become even more irrelevant than it already is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MacNeil suggested the lust for ratings makes public television  
news even more important than when ``NewsHour'' began in 1975. Even 
PBS is not immune, said MacNeil, who suggested the recent 
controversy about PBS's ``Washington Week in Review'' illustrated 
what happens when ratings become paramount. 
</P>
<P>
	The show's former moderator, Ken Bode, walked away after he said  
new management there wanted ``more attitude'' at the program. 
Management denied the characterization, but it proved an 
embarrassingly public airing of differences. 
</P>
<P>
	``By dumbing itself down, by whoring just for numbers, public  
television will lose not only its numbers but its soul,'' MacNeil 
said.

<HEADLINE>  Rebels Support Ocalan's Peace Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IMRALI ISLAND, Turkey (AP) -- Kurdish guerrillas said they  
support rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan's calls for peace, but warned 
Wednesday they will keep fighting if his conciliatory offer goes 
unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
	The court trying Ocalan for treason asked both sides Wednesday  
to wrap up their cases, a sign that a verdict could come as soon as 
next week. The Kurdish rebel chief could be sentenced to hang. 
</P>
<P>
	In the largely Kurdish southeast, a suspected rebel blew himself  
up near a military garrison Wednesday, causing no other casualties. 
There have been sporadic rebel attacks since the trial began 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Emotions ran high at the trial Wednesday, with the widow of a  
slain soldier describing how she watched her husband being led away 
from a rebel roadblock and shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Spectators and lawyers were moved to tears when a sobbing Yildiz  
Namdar shouted: ``You apologize, but will you bring my husband 
back?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I share your grief,'' Ocalan replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan pressed his defense, stating that since 1993 his  
Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, has wanted to pursue a peaceful 
solution to the rebel fight for autonomy. Earlier, he told rebels 
from his bulletproof, bombproof enclosure in the courtroom to lay 
down their arms and said he was ready to work for peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want my message regarding peace and brotherhood to be  
noticed,'' Ocalan told the court. 
</P>
<P>
	The PKK leadership said it fully backed Ocalan's offer.  
</P>
<P>
	``Such a brave initiative is being left unanswered,'' it warned  
in a statement. ``We have fought for 15 years... If necessary we 
can do the same thing again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement was carried by the Kurdish news agency DEM, which  
is based in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey regards any hint of Kurdish nationalism as a threat to  
the state and has rejected offers to talk with the rebels. Ocalan 
launched his guerrilla war in 1984, and so far the conflict has 
killed 37,000 people, most of them Kurds. 
</P>
<P>
	Turgut Okyay, the head of the three-member panel trying Ocalan,  
asked both sides Wednesday to prepare their final arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	A verdict in the trial could come as early as June 11, said  
Cengiz Erkoyuncu, a lawyer representing the families of fallen 
Turkish soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Trials in Turkish courts usually take months if not years  
because sessions are often held only once every month or two. But 
there is strong pressure within Turkey to quickly conclude the 
Ocalan trial, and sessions have been held every day. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial also is moving swiftly because Ocalan has already  
accepted responsibility for many of the PKK's actions, which are 
considered treasonous under Turkish law and punishable by death. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been many signs that Turkish authorities are keen  
to get the trial over quickly,'' said Neil Hicks of the New 
York-based Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. ``That does call 
into question the presumption of innocence requirement in the 
trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Ocalan's lawyers and his relatives said they would  
not attend Thursday's session because their security had not been 
guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
	They said they had been attacked both physically and verbally  
and were forced to leave their hotel after the management received 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Ocalan pressed forward with what appears to be a  
strategy of disassociating himself from some of the group's 
bloodiest acts and attacks against civilians. He blamed violence 
against civilians on factions within the PKK that were outside of 
his control. 
</P>
<P>
	Any death sentence must be approved by parliament. Although  
several dozen Turks have been sentenced to death, Turkey has not 
executed anyone since 1984.

	The ``Star Wars'' space fantasy series holds a special appeal  
for the Japanese, who see it as an updated version of classic 
samurai films. 
</P>
<P>
	The first ``Star Wars'' movie was inspired in part by ``The  
Hidden Fortress,'' a 1958 film about a warrior's journey by 
Kurosawa, Japan's most renowned director. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans in Japan were quick to find elements of Japan's feudal  
warlord culture in the 1977 movie, citing everything from the 
design of villainous Darth Vader's costume to the samurai-style 
swordplay, albeit with lightsabers. 
</P>
<P>
	Director George Lucas, in Tokyo on Wednesday to plug the new  
film, acknowledged his debt to Kurosawa. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just a master that you work toward (hoping) that someday  
you can reach that level,'' Lucas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, audiences here won't get a look at the film until  
opening day, July 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Although ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' opened in  
the United States and Canada on May 19, it won't be released in 
many Asian and European nations until mid- to late summer. 
</P>
<P>
	For many Japanese fans, that's just too much to ask.  
</P>
<P>
	Hiroshi Kobayashi, a 27-year-old graduate student whose business  
card reads ``Star Wars Evangelist,'' was one of 30 Japanese fans 
who flew to Los Angeles last month to see the new film. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of Japanese subtitles made the dialogue hard to follow,  
but he still gave it a thumbs up. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had a great visual impact,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	After its release in the United States, ``The Phantom Menace''  
earned more than $205 million in a record 13 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry experts here are optimistic. Most expect it to go over  
well with the Japanese audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Toshio Furusawa, 20th Century Fox's marketing director in Japan,  
said pre-release ticket sales have been strong and that demand for 
4,000 passes to a ``Star Wars'' fan event held last month exceeded 
availability by 30 times. 
</P>
<P>
	``The movie looks like it was made for audiences in Japan,''  
said Japanese film critic Yuichi Tanuma, who attended a special 
showing for the media last month in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	He said ``The Phantom Menace'' has touches of Japanese influence  
in the Kabuki-style facial makeup sported by the evil Darth Maul 
and Zen-like meditation practiced by the heroic Jedi knights.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Increases U.S. Commitment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AIR FORCE ACADEMY, Colo. (AP) -- President Clinton increased the  
U.S. pledge for a Kosovo peacekeeping force to 7,000 troops 
Wednesday and said America must not grow weary and ``abandon a just 
cause'' in the conflict with Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some things are worth fighting for,'' the president said in a  
commencement address to a new generation of military leaders: the 
804 men and 140 women graduating in the academy's class of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a brilliant sun, the president snapped a salute and shook  
hands with each diploma-clutching graduate in Falcon Stadium. In a 
roaring finale, the Air Force Thunderbird jets roared over the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton announced he was deploying 68 more aircraft, including  
four dozen fighters, for the NATO mission. That will bring the 
total number of U.S. aircraft supporting the airstrikes to 769. 
</P>
<P>
	He also announced the United States would contribute about 7,000  
troops to a 50,000-member NATO peacekeeping force that would enter 
Kosovo as part of a peace settlement to oversee the return of 
hundreds of thousands of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally, the United States had offered to send 4,000  
peacekeepers for a 28,000-member international force, but the U.S. 
commitment was upped as the anticipated peacekeeping needs grew. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton sought to rally support for airstrikes in Yugoslavia as  
polls show declining support for the campaign and an accompanying 
drop in his own job approval rating. His speech came on the eve of 
a White House meeting with the nation's top military leaders to 
discuss the conflict, including the possibility of an eventual 
ground invasion to oust Slobodan Milosevic's forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot grow weary of this campaign because Mr. Milosevic  
didn't capitulate when the first bombs fell,'' the president said 
on the 71st day of airstrikes. ``We cannot abandon a just cause 
because an adversary holds out for more than a few news cycles. I 
reject that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Answering growing criticism of U.S. involvement, Clinton said  
the United States has both a moral and strategic stake in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why are we in Kosovo?'' he asked. ``Because we have a moral  
responsibility to oppose crimes against humanity and mass ethnic 
and religious killing and cleansing where we can,'' the president 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because we have a security responsibility to prevent a wider  
war in Europe, which we know from our two world wars would 
eventually draw America in at far greater cost in lives, time and 
treasure,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton disputed claims that NATO's bombing triggered  
Milosevic's campaign of executions and expulsions of ethnic 
Albanians from Kosovo. He said Milosevic had done the same thing 
earlier in Bosnia and Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ethnic cleansing in Kosovo was not a response to bombing,''  
Clinton said. ``It is the 10-year method of Mr. Milosevic's 
madness. Had we done nothing, the tragedy would have been 
permanent, accepted and, in effect, condoned by the world 
community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Expressing determination to prevail, Clinton said, ``We have  
acted quickly to end this horror and that is exactly what we will 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If NATO had failed to act, Clinton said, ``Slobodan Milosevic  
would then have become a model of success for 21st century rulers 
trying to obliterate multiethnic societies, instead of the symbol 
of bankrupt policies based on hate that we want to confine to the 
dustbin of history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton singled out for recognition two academy alumni flying  
Kosovo missions -- a B-2 bomber pilot and a C-130 cargo plane pilot. 
They stood, to cheers, but were not named because they are still 
flying missions in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the U.S.  
contribution to a peacekeeping force probably would include three 
armor battalions from the 1st Infantry Division, nicknamed the 
``Big Red One, in Germany, which would translate to roughly 3,000 
soldiers with tanks and other heavy armor; several battalions of 
Army engineers; an aviation group with transport and attack 
helicopters; a military police battalion and an artillery 
battalion.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Find Flooding Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Scientists say they have found a link between  
weather patterns that can potentially help predict devastating 
floods on the Yangtze River. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of Chinese and American scientists collected radar,  
weather, satellite and other data in 1998 in the hope of better 
predictions. Flooding in southeastern China last year killed more 
than 3,700 people and caused an estimated $30 billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Government planners want better information to take measures to  
reduce losses of human life, livestock, crops and property. 
</P>
<P>
	William Lau, a NASA atmospheric scientist who helped oversee the  
project, said its researchers found that a pair of early May 
cyclones over the Indian Ocean seemed to delay by a week the onset 
late that month of the storm pattern known as the South China Sea 
monsoon. The weaker and later monsoon, in turn, appeared to 
foretell the contrasting heavy rains to the north in the Yangtze 
basin. 
</P>
<P>
	Project scientists said they need to study data over a broader  
area to gain greater certainty and draw more connections. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how good you are in terms of understanding, there is  
some randomness in nature,'' Lau said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists for the project, known as the South China Sea Monsoon  
Experiment, spoke at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union, 
which includes many climatologists.

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- A Japanese businessman kidnapped and robbed by  
two policemen met his alleged abductors at the police station where 
he was filing a complaint, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Masahito Ake, 40, part of a delegation accompanying Japan's  
Princess Sayako during a visit to Peru, was leaving a Lima 
discotheque Tuesday when he was forced into a patrol car by the 
suspects, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	His captors forced him to withdraw money from ATM machines and  
took him to his hotel, where they gave him 10 minutes to return 
with more cash, the Lima newspaper El Sol reported. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ake called his embassy and later arrived at the police  
station accompanied by top police officials. There, he recognized 
the suspects, who were arrested, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former and active service police officers on Peru's notoriously  
corrupt forces are often linked to criminal and kidnapping gangs. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	LA PAZ, Bolivia AP) -- Japan's Princess Sayako was given a warm  
welcome in this Andean city Wednesday and received by President 
Hugo Banzer on the second day of a week-long visit to Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sayako, the only daughter of Emperor Akihito and Empress  
Michiko, will visit the tropical city of Santa Cruz Thursday to 
mark the 100th anniversary of Japanese emigration to Bolivia. Later 
in the day she will fly to the Colonial city of Sucre where she 
will visit Colonial churches and dinosaur tracks found in the 
outskirts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Sayako was also given the keys to the city Wednesday by La Paz  
Mayor Lupe Andrade. Thousands of onlookers wove Japanese flags as 
Sayako passed through this city of one million located at an 
altitude of 3,600 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Sayako, who is also known by the title Norinomiya, will attend  
exhibitions and ceremonies celebrating Japanese emigration to the 
tropical rain forests near the city of Santa Cruz and also visit 
areas where people of Japanese ancestry have settled.

	SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- Despite opposition objections,  
El Salvador's former intelligence chief took office Wednesday as 
the head of the national police in one of Latin America's most 
violent countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Mauricio Sandoval was sworn in to head the 17,000-member force  
by President Francisco Flores, who took office on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Farabundo Marti Front, the political party formed by former  
leftist guerrillas, claims that Sandoval, as head of the State 
Intelligence Agency, spied on politicians -- including some from the 
governing party. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerson Martinez, a legislator from the Front, said Sandoval  
could use the police to carry out intelligence activities, which he 
said would violate the 1992 peace agreement that ended the 
country's 12-year civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandoval also served as government spokesman during the 1989-94  
administration of President Alfredo Cristiani.

<HEADLINE> Something Swampy at Shea Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shea Stadium was built on landfill, but it  
seemed more like a swamp around home plate Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the first pitch of their 8-7 win over the New York Mets,  
the Cincinnati Reds complained to umpires that the batter's box was 
a quagmire, and umpires made the grounds crew come out and pour a 
drying substance over the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what they're trying to do over there,'' said Mike  
Cameron, who drove in four runs with a two-run triple and a 
go-ahead, two-run single off John Franco with two outs in the 
ninth. ``I guess they figure we got good speed, so they tried to 
slow us down a bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati and New York each had 47 steals coming in, tied for  
fourth in the NL. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like a beach out there,'' Reds manager Jack McKeon  
said. ``A beach and a swimming pool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about whether the Mets deliberately soaked the field, Mets  
manager Bobby Valentine shrugged his shoulders and didn't answer. 
</P>
<P>
	McKeon wouldn't speculate whether it was Valentine's decision,  
but was happy it happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't let us go to sleep. Do something to wake us up,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds also complained about the glove of Mets starting  
pitcher Jason Isringhausen, saying there was white on it -- which is 
against baseball's rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine then took a marker and blacked out the white on the  
glove. 
</P>
<P>
	McKeon said Reds coach Don Gullett noticed the glove.  
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Oh, yeah, we'll get that changed,''' McKeon said.

<HEADLINE> Lawsuit Filed Against Gunmakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Camden County has joined the list of local  
governments suing the gun industry to recover costs stemming from 
handgun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit does not specify a damage amount, but officials said  
Wednesday that the county has spent millions cleaning up the damage 
wrought by firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	The county, the first local government to file such a suit in  
the state, wants to recoup part of the cost of running offices for 
the prosecutor, sheriff, and medical examiner, and the juvenile 
detention center and county jail, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court, also seeks to  
compel the gun industry to use so-called ``smart gun'' technology, 
rendering guns inoperable by anyone except the registered owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 30 people were killed by handguns in Camden County,  
across the Delaware River from Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit names 21 gun manufacturers, and also includes 20  
``John Doe'' manufacturers, distributors and dealers whose names 
are not yet known. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a dozen municipal or county governments have sued,  
including New Orleans, Chicago, Miami and Dade County, Fla.; 
Bridgeport, Conn.; Atlanta; Cleveland; Detroit and Wayne County, 
Mich.; and Cincinnati.

<HEADLINE> Euro Sinks to Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- As the euro sank to a new low today,  
European Central Bank chief Wim Duisenberg said he remained 
confident that Europe's new single currency remained sound. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm inclined to play down short-term volatility moves in the  
exchange rate,'' he said after the bank's regular biweekly meeting. 
``In the long run, I see more factors pointing at an appreciation 
of the euro than at a depreciation of the euro.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duisenberg's comments came as the euro fell under $1.035 for the  
first time in European trading. The euro's value was roughly 11 
percent below its Jan. 1 launch level. The drop followed last 
week's decision by European Union finance ministers to condone 
Italy's plan to increase its planned deficit for 1999 to 2.4 
percent from 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Key central bankers have called Italy's decision shortsighted,  
complaining it weakens the strict fiscal criteria adopted to ensure 
the euro's stability. 
</P>
<P>
	Duisenberg noted that Italy was not breaking the rules, which  
allow for a 3 percent deficit, but warned against fiscal laxity 
spreading through the European Monetary Union. ``If that were to 
become a trend, then there would be a real reason for concern,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	German Finance Minister Hans Eichel, in a newspaper interview  
published today, denied the decision to give Italy more budgetary 
leeway was any ``weakening of the criteria.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Italy remains committed to cutting its deficit to 1 percent of  
gross domestic product by 2001 and must take extra measures to 
achieve this, Eichel told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. 
</P>
<P>
	Duisenberg also said the main economic factor weighing on the  
euro is the diverging economies between the United States and 
Europe, as well as the Kosovo conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	He also noted that the economic outlook for the 11 Euro  
countries signals favorable conditions for a recovery toward the 
end of the year and next year. 
</P>
<P>
	European Central Bank officials have stressed that the euro's  
weakness is no cause for concern, and have ruled out intervening in 
foreign exchange markets to support the single currency, 
emphasizing instead the euro's medium- and long-term potential. 
</P>
<P>
	At its biweekly meeting, bank policy makers left key interest  
rates unchanged, as widely expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Nations participating in the euro are: Austria, Belgium,  
Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the 
Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.

<HEADLINE> Baffert's Aim is Winning at Belmont </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Trainer Bob Baffert doesn't see the filly  
Silverbulletday's role as that of spoiler when she competes in the 
Belmont Stakes against Charismatic, winner of the first two legs of 
the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going in as a spoiler,'' Baffert said. ``We're going  
in to win. We want a Belmont trophy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert went to the 1997-98 Belmonts with Kentucky  
Derby-Preakness winners Silver Charm and Real Quiet. Silver Charm's 
bid was spoiled by Touch Gold by three-quarters of a length in 
1997. The bid of Real Quiet was repulsed by a nose by Victory 
Gallop. 
</P>
<P>
	Real Quiet is owned by Mike Pegram, owner of Silverbulletday.  
Silver Charm is owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis, owners of 
Charismatic. 
</P>
<P>
	Out to foil Charismatic's bid will be Menifee, the Elliott  
Walden-trained stablemate of Victory Gallop. The two colts were 
runnersup in both the Derby and Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	D. Wayne Lukas, Charismatic's trainer, said Tuesday he doesn't  
care how many other 3-year-olds test his strapping chestnut, and 
that he welcomes tough opponents. He doesn't want to hear comments 
about the quality of the competition or questions about whether 
Charismatic deserves to be a Triple Crown champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope everybody who has one ready, runs him,'' Lukas  
said. ``We don't want any second-guessing on Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 12-horse field was expected to be entered today, with the  
post-position draw set for 11:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Derby-Preakness starters to try the Belmont are the Nick  
Zito-trained pair of Adonis and Stephen Got Even. Back for another 
shot at Charismatic are Derby starter Lemon Drop Kid and Patience 
Game. Set to join the Triple Crown competition are Best of Luck, 
Pineaff, Prime Directive, Vision and Verse and Teletable. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic and Silverbulletday both put in their final Belmont  
workouts Tuesday at Churchill Downs on a track wet from an 
overnight rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic worked in predawn darkness at about 6 a.m. EDT, and  
went five-eighths of a mile in 1:00 2-5, going the last quarter in 
24 seconds. He galloped out three-quarters in 1:14. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pleased,'' Lukas said. ``I was happy he was able to  
stretch his legs and open his lungs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday, who will be making her debut against males,  
worked five-eighths of a mile about 2 1/2 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Bob Baffert said the winner of 11 of 12 starts was timed  
in 59 1-5 and galloped out in 1:12. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doesn't she look beautiful, though,'' Baffert said as the  
filly raced down the Churchill Downs stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a fantastic,'' Baffert said. ``It showed me what I was  
looking for.'' Then, he quipped, ``I don't know what I was looking 
for, but it looked good when I saw it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope she runs the way she worked,'' Pegram said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Belmont will be Charismatic's fifth race in 10 weeks. A  
fourth straight victory -- he won the Lexington on April 18 at 
Keeneland -- would make him the 12th Triple Crown winner and the 
first since Affirmed in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday will be the 21st filly to start in 131 Belmonts.  
The only two to win were Ruthless in the first Belmont in 1867 and 
Tanya in 1905. Ruthless beat three males over 1 5/8 miles, while Tanya 
beat six rivals, including another filly, at 1 1/4 miles.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Clears DePaul in Hoops Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- NCAA investigators decided that the DePaul men's  
basketball program didn't commit a major recruiting violation last 
year when it signed one of the best freshmen classes in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The only infraction investigators cited was an instance when two  
recruits were served pizza in the DePaul locker room after a game, 
said James R. Doyle, the school's vice president for student 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle said Tuesday that the university had received a letter  
from the NCAA that concurred with the school's own finding that 
there were no violations that warranted sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is they found nothing except what we  
self-reported,'' Doyle told the Chicago Sun-Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left with Doyle and NCAA spokeswoman Kimberly Dixon  
were not returned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation was prompted by an allegation that a DePaul  
player had bought a video game for Quentin Richardson -- a recruit 
who went on to become Conference USA's player of the year as a 
freshman -- with money provided by an assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found no evidence that would support those allegations,''  
Doyle said of a claim made by Innis Glover, a DePaul player whose 
scholarship was taken away by coach Pat Kennedy before last season. 
</P>
<P>
	DePaul's investigation did confirm that a DePaul player had  
taken a prospective recruit to a strip club, but that the coaching 
staff wasn't involved and no NCAA rules were violated. 
</P>
<P>
	The two players involved with serving the pizza donated the cost  
of the pizza to charity, Doyle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Richardson, fellow Chicago high school standouts Lance  
Williams and Bobby Simmons became freshmen starters for the Demons 
last season. Richardson thought about turning pro but decided last 
month to return to the Chicago school for his sophomore year. 
</P>
<P>
	DePaul (18-13) lost to California in the second round of the  
NIT.

<HEADLINE> Influx of Cubans Blamed on INS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- In an influx some blame on a new U.S. policy, more  
than 200 Cuban refugees came ashore or were picked up off the 
Florida coast in a recent five-day span. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigration Commissioner Doris Meissner ruled last month that  
Cuban refugees are immediately eligible for a work permit. Before 
her order, Cuban refugees were not guaranteed employment. 
</P>
<P>
	One Border Patrol agent said the new policy is the reason for  
the increase in refugees, most of whom paid smugglers $5,000 to 
$7,000 to get here. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no fear of deportation, there's no fear of being held  
in detention a long time,'' Border Patrol agent Dean Sinclair said 
Wednesday. ``The most they'll be held is a week while they're being 
processed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Carmen Marrero, who works with refugees for the  
Catholic Charities Group in Miami, said recent refugees have not 
mentioned the change in INS policy as a reason for coming to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say they come here because they have no freedom and  
because of the economic problems'' in Cuba, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	INS spokesman Dan Kane said he saw no connection between the  
clarified policy and an increase in immigrants from Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard detained 272 Cubans found at sea in May, the  
highest monthly total since 1994. From Friday through Tuesday 
night, 222 came ashore or were picked up at sea.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Find Flooding Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Scientists said Wednesday they have found a link  
between weather patterns that can potentially help predict 
devastating floods on the Yangtze River. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 flooding in southeastern China killed more than 3700  
people and caused an estimated $30 billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	A joint team of Chinese and American scientists collected radar,  
weather, satellite and other data in 1998 in the hope of better 
weather predictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Government planners want better information to take measures to  
reduce losses of human life, livestock, crops and property. 
</P>
<P>
	William Lau, a NASA atmospheric scientist who helped oversee the  
project, said its researchers found that a pair of early May 
cyclones over the Indian Ocean seemed to delay by a week the onset 
late that month of the storm pattern known as the South China Sea 
monsoon. The weaker and later monsoon, in turn, appeared to 
foretell the contrasting heavy rains to the north in the Yangtze 
basin. 
</P>
<P>
	Project scientists said they need to study data over a broader  
area to gain greater certainty and draw more connections. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how good you are in terms of understanding, there is  
some randomness in nature,'' Lau said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists for the project, known as the South China Sea Monsoon  
Experiment, spoke at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union, 
which includes many climatologists.

	EU Orders Belgian Poultry Destroyed  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union called today for the  
destruction of Belgian chickens, eggs and any byproducts that could 
be laced with cancer-causing dioxin. The Belgian government issued 
a similar order for pigs, fearful that many of them have also been 
infected by the same contaminated animal feed. In Belgium, two 
officials from a major animal feed fat producer were arrested and 
accused of tampering with the fat that goes into animal feed, the 
likely cause how toxic dioxins entered the food chain.

	9 Die in Ark. Plane Crash Landing  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Nine people died in the crash landing  
of an American Airlines jet last night, a coroner confirmed today. 
Investigators want to know what the pilot, who died, was told about 
the violent weather before he attempted to land Flight 1420 at the 
Little Rock airport just before midnight. They said, however, that 
it was too early to say whether the rapidly moving storm caused or 
contributed to the crash. Hospitals said they treated 83 people for 
injuries, mostly cuts and burns. Another 51 people were unhurt. Two 
people are unaccounted for.

	ACLU: Drug War Based on Race

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A report by the American Civil Liberties Union  
claims that the war on drugs has significantly increased the number 
of traffic stops based on race throughout the country. ACLU 
Executive Director Ira Glasser said ``skin color has become a 
substitute for evidence.'' Glasser said the Drug Enforcement 
Administration's ``Operation Pipeline'' has trained at least 27,000 
law enforcement officials on how to spot drug couriers on highways 
and has unfairly created a perception that blacks, Hispanics and 
other minorities are more likely to possess drugs.

Trade Agreement and the business opportunities available for those 
willing to resolve them. NAFTA has been blamed for everything from 
sewage leaks to traffic-clogged roads to housing shortages. Energy

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A possible merger between oil giants Texaco and  
Chevron has been called off after Texaco said Chevron's proposal 
was ``unacceptable for several reasons.'' The deal between the 
nation's third and fourth-biggest energy companies would have been 
worth a reported $42 billion. Large oil companies have been rushing 
to unite because of falling oil prices and the need to cut costs. 
Shareholders of Exxon and Mobil, the nation's two biggest energy

	'Home Improvement' Goes Out on Top  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The final episode of ``Home Improvement'' was  
easily the week's most-watched TV program, but it wasn't enough to 
help ABC win the weekly ratings battle. ``Home Improvement'' drew 
an estimated 35.5 million viewers, Nielsen Media Research said 
today, making it the fourth-highest rated series finale of the 
1990s behind ``Seinfeld,'' ``Cheers'' and ``The Cosby Show.'' 
Still, NBC scored a narrow victory for the week and won the May 
``sweeps'' period, when ratings are watched closely to set local 
advertising rates. NBC had a 7.8 rating and 14 share. ABC and CBS 
both had 7.5 ratings and 14 shares.

<HEADLINE> China Communists Facing Discontent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FUCHENG, China (AP) -- A decade after crushing pro-democracy  
protests, China's communist leaders are facing seething discontent. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike the student-led Tiananmen Square democracy movement  
that was bloodily quelled by the army on June 4, 1989, the biggest 
challenge to communist rule comes now from the unskilled, not the 
educated elite. 
</P>
<P>
	Legions of Chinese farmers struggling under heavy tax burdens  
and hordes of workers fired by failing state industries are feeling 
left behind by free-market reforms that have raised living 
standards for millions of Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	``The taxes the government wants are too high, so we farmers  
have to protest,'' said Sun Junzheng, who is trying to feed his 
family of four from a sliver of an acre in this dusty patch of 
north China farm country. 
</P>
<P>
	When the tax collectors arrived at the village of King's Passing  
a few months ago, the poor residents turned them away. But the 
collectors came back, this time with police, and seized all the 
sacks of wheat, rice and peanuts they could find. 
</P>
<P>
	The confrontation left the farmers with barely enough grain to  
scrape through to the next harvest -- but the anger to fight again. 
</P>
<P>
	On the rise the past three years, protests by workers and  
farmers have swelled even more this year, according to a Communist 
Party directive to local leaders on handling the protests. 
</P>
<P>
	In the countryside, anger is directed at high taxes and land  
grabs by officials. In the cities, it's shoddy housing, investment 
scams, unpaid pensions and a lack of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Driving the grievances are falling incomes for many Chinese and,  
in an echo from the Tiananmen protests, complaints about rapacious 
corruption among local officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``In overcoming these problems, we cannot be optimistic,'' the  
party directive said. 
</P>
<P>
	Heirs to a peasant revolution, China's communist leaders are  
aware of the threat to their rule. They are studying an overhaul of 
the tax system to keep cash-starved local governments from fleecing 
farmers and have begun a nationwide retraining program for 
bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Headed by Vice President Hu Jintao and Zeng Qinghong, a  
confidant of party leader and President Jiang Zemin, the campaign 
aims to inculcate honesty and make officials more responsive to 
both Beijing's dictates and local complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	In the short term, officials have adopted more direct measures:  
repression or payoffs, anything to ensure peace in the months 
leading up to celebrations of the 50th anniversary of communist 
rule on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither strategy has prevented confrontations this year.  
</P>
<P>
	Some 5,000 tax-protesting farmers reportedly fought with  
hundreds of riot police in southern Hunan province. One person 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	Bombs have been set off or planted in at least eight cities,  
many of them places where protests have occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Most disputes have been less dramatic, with locals and officials  
left in a standoff of mutual suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors in the Sanchen Group futures company swarmed  
government offices in the northeastern city of Panjin and paralyzed 
intersections in March after the company president disappeared with 
$24 million. The protesters charged city politicians had been 
bought off. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Zichuan district government in eastern Shandong  
province closed a mismanaged agricultural fund in April, locals 
demonstrated to demand repayment and accuse officials of skimming 
money to build offices and pay for entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	At King's Passing, 120 miles south of Beijing, farmers have been  
trying to fend off tax collectors for three years, Sun and fellow 
villagers said. Last year, police seized televisions and bicycles 
until the recalcitrant paid up. This winter, they took grain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every year is worse than the last,'' said Sun, a farmer all  
his 35 years. ``It'll happen again in July.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sun and his fellow farmers are each obligated to hand over 330  
pounds of grain -- a fifth to a third of a typical farmer's harvest 
-- and pay a 5 percent income tax. 
</P>
<P>
	After paying up, Sun said, he has little money for school fees  
for his two children and for fertilizer and irrigation water for 
his farm plot, much less for clothes and other daily necessities. 
</P>
<P>
	National leaders are trying to keep local governments from  
increasing fees. A recent directive ordered a cap on local charges 
for schooling, marriage certificates and building permits. 
</P>
<P>
	Premier Zhu Rongji also warned provincial officials in March not  
to worsen tensions by resorting to ``crude or dictatorial 
methods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message has not been widely received. In Panjin, Zichuan and  
King's Passing, residents seeking redress complain of harassment by 
police and plainclothes agents -- charges the local governments 
deny. 
</P>
<P>
	``The common folk want to stir things up, but they are afraid  
to,'' said an angry Zichuan resident, who spoke anonymously in fear 
of retribution.

<HEADLINE> Star Watch: Joan Plowright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Joan Plowright says it felt good to get out of  
her straitjacket. 
</P>
<P>
	Straitjacket?  
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, a straitjacket -- Lady Olivier,'' she answers, laughing.  
</P>
<P>
	Married for 28 years to Sir Laurence Olivier until his death in  
1989, Plowright is talking about how her film career has flourished 
over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think I hit a lucky streak, starting off with Lawrence  
Kasdan,'' her director in ``I Love You to Death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Kline had enjoyed her performances in two English films  
and suggested that Kasdan send her the script of the 1990 dark 
comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just loved the opportunity to do something wild -- get out of  
my straitjacket,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Then she took a role in Barry Levinson's ``Avalon'' and, as she  
puts it, ``then it kind of snowballed,'' with such varied films as 
``Enchanted April,'' for which she received an Academy Award 
nomination, and ``Last Action Hero.'' She even played Mrs. Wilson 
in ``Dennis the Menace'' and took a role in ``101 Dalmatians'' -- 
both as a ``treat'' to her grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Now she's co-starring in a cinematic rarity -- a film dominated  
by powerhouse actresses, Oscar winners Judi Dench, Maggie Smith and 
Cher. Lily Tomlin also appears. In Franco Zeffirelli's 
autobiographical ``Tea With Mussolini,'' Plowright, Dench and Smith 
are the ``scorpioni,'' tart-tongued British expatriates who help 
raise a boy born out-of-wedlock in fascist, wartime Italy -- each in 
her own idiosyncratic way. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thought of being all together for the first time made us  
feel, `Gosh, this is an opportunity that is probably never going to 
happen again,''' Plowright said during a recent visit to New York 
from London. 
</P>
<P>
	And she's right.  
</P>
<P>
	It's overstating the obvious to talk about the paucity of roles  
for older women, the 69-year-old Plowright says. ``One has almost 
gotten tired of saying it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's nothing new, as she points out. ``In the classical theater,  
there are probably 20 male parts to three female.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So she's grateful for parts that extend beyond ``maiden aunts,  
or battered wives, or decoration -- on the arms of a man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luck isn't enough, she says; versatility is essential.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is something that we are more trained to do in England. We  
are trained in drama school, and having the permanent companies ... 
you are contracted for two or three years. You have a development 
program. You play Lady Macbeth one night, and a Chekhov girl the 
next night who's dying of unrequited love, then you play a nice, 
saucy maid in a French classic ... and then you're doing `Guys and 
Dolls.''' 
</P>
<P>
	So once you get the opportunity to move into films, she says,  
you can draw upon ``that enormous background, of having created 
different characters in different styles, (written by) different 
authors, both classic, contemporary, and musical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because her mother ran a local amateur drama group, Plowright  
was involved in theater at age 3. Although her father, a newspaper 
editor, initially disapproved of her becoming an actress, she soon 
was spending school vacations at summer sessions of university 
drama schools. After high school, she studied at the Laban Art of 
Movement Studio in Manchester then won a two-year scholarship to 
the drama school at the Old Vic Theatre in London. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1956, she joined the English Stage Company, headquartered at  
London's Royal Court Theater, where she gained recognition in 
dramas written by the so-called Angry Young Men. 
</P>
<P>
	She fondly recalls that playwrights and performers alike enjoyed  
the anger they provoked -- cries of ``Rubbish!'' and seats being 
slammed as audience members walked out of the Royal Court. 
</P>
<P>
	And it was the unlikely meeting place for her, her fellow rebels  
and Olivier, considered by many to be the century's greatest actor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Larry appeared to be the epitome of the Establishment, an  
old-fashioned great success of the West End. Of course, he wasn't. 
... He came to the Royal Court to do John Osborne's `The 
Entertainer.' There we were all thinking, `Oh Lord, we're being 
invaded by this Sir','' says Plowright, who played his daughter in 
the stage and screen version. 
</P>
<P>
	But he took off his coat and started rehearsing with a power and  
passion that won them over. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goodness, I mean, he was just one of us! He was an actor.  
That's what he was. A great actor! But he was an ACTOR -- with 
ACTORS!'' 
</P>
<P>
	She and Olivier were more than impressed with each other's  
acting talents -- they were smitten. A year after Olivier divorced 
Vivien Leigh, they were married in Connecticut. Both were appearing 
on Broadway at the time -- he in ``Becket,'' she in ``A Taste of 
Honey,'' for which she won the 1961 best-actress Tony. 
</P>
<P>
	She soon felt the straitjacket.  
</P>
<P>
	She thought she couldn't be herself in public, and feared her  
opinions in interviews would be taken to be Olivier's. ``Which 
people would do in those days,'' she says. ``And that's why I got 
into a straitjacket. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to be awfully careful of what I said. Because it would  
be somehow assumed, or they could use his name, because it was a 
bigger name than mine -- `Olivier thinks ...' because his wife said 
so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, she reckoned that she could say to the press and  
public: ``Don't think Larry thinks the same thing. If you want to 
know what he thinks, ask him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She and Olivier had three children, and she concentrated on  
their home life while he took over the National Theater Company -- 
with a lot of help from her there, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those choices were made because they were strongly felt and  
they are not regretted,'' she says firmly. 
</P>
<P>
	A major reason their marriage worked for nearly three decades  
was that they could talk to each other about anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was also to do with a passion for the job which was shared.  
... Understanding, compassion, and the fact that one person can put 
their career on hold now and again. And I think that is essential. 
I mean quite obviously if I'd gone off all over the place, it 
wouldn't have lasted. He'd have found somebody else,'' she says, 
chuckling ruefully, ``to have the talks with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When she's not working, she spends most weekends at a country  
home in Sussex with all or part of her family. She dotes on her 
four grandchildren, ages 2 to 11. She has taken them to Disneyland 
and now wants to take them to Venice or Florence -- ``to give them 
alternatives to television and video games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She finally intends to start an autobiography. Previously, she

<HEADLINE> Scientist Ties Knots in DNA Strands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A Japanese researcher has managed to tie incredibly tiny knots  
in strands of DNA by using laser beams like tweezers, a technique 
that could help cell research work. 
</P>
<P>
	Yasuharu Arai, a graduate student at Keio University in  
Yokohama, used a powerful microscope equipped with optical tweezers 
-- a laser beam split into two independently controlled beams -- to 
twist the molecular strings. 
</P>
<P>
	He first glued ``handles'' to each end of the strands, then  
directed the laser at the handles, which by their nature were drawn 
toward light. With one beam holding an end of the strand in place, 
he used the other beam to loop it around. 
</P>
<P>
	After months of failure, he has knotted more than a dozen  
strands of DNA from a fish-infecting virus. He has even put two 
knots in a few strands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did it for fun and for the challenge, just like climbing  
Mount Everest for the first time,'' said Kazuhiko Kinosita Jr., a 
physics professor who helped coordinate the projects. ``No one had 
done it before. In this Mr. Arai we have a first. For him it is an 
art.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The work was described in today's issue of the journal Nature.  
</P>
<P>
	The DNA strands were 0.002 micrometers wide and 16 micrometers  
long. A micrometer is about one one-hundredth the width of a human 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Arai performed the feat as part of his master's thesis in  
physics. He now works for an automotive company. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Colbert of Rice University's Center for Nanoscale Science  
and Technology said the technique would be of special interest to 
biologists eager to manipulate cells. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this offers a real contribution. It's a nice trick,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Sales of New Homes Up 9.2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans have a case of home buying fever.  
New home sales reached their second highest level on record in 
April as buyers, trying to stay ahead of rising mortgage rates, 
rushed to close deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of new single-family homes jumped 9.2 percent in April,  
following four straight months of declines, the Commerce Department 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The surge pushed up sales of new homes to a seasonally adjusted  
annual rate of 978,000 units in April, the second highest level on 
record. The all-time high was a sales rate of 985,000 units set 
last November. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Americans, buoyed by a healthy economy but  
concerned about the prospects of even higher mortgage rates, are 
buying homes now to take advantage of existing rates, which have 
been creeping up. 
</P>
<P>
	``No doubt some of the strength in sales ... is due to buyers  
locking in before mortgage rates go higher,'' said David Orr, 
economist with First Union. 
</P>
<P>
	A national survey of mortgage rates showed them hitting 7.23  
percent for the past two weeks, the highest level in 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	And, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America reported  
Wednesday that loan applications increased 1.7 percent last week 
from the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because interest rates are rising, households are jumping off  
the fence buying homes to lock in rates. So you are going to see a 
nice boost in housing activity because of that,'' said the 
association's economist David Lereah. 
</P>
<P>
	The report on new home sales showed the surge in demand was  
accompanied by a rise in prices. The median price of all new homes 
sold last month climbed 3 percent to a record $159,500. The median 
is the midpoint where half the homes sold for more and half for 
less. 
</P>
<P>
	The average sales price rose 3.7 percent to $193,100, also a  
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts believed that the rise in home prices along with  
the jump in sales increase the odds that the Federal Reserve would 
jack up interest rates to slow economic activity down to a more 
sustainable pace and relieve rising price pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed next meets on interest rates June 29-30. At their last  
meeting, Fed officials changed their policy stance in the direction 
of leaning toward a rate increase, a move that has raised worries 
in financial markets that a rate increase could be imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	While stocks were down as much as 131 points at one point  
because of those worries, the Dow Jones industrial average managed 
to rally and close at 10,578, down 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Wednesday he was  
concerned about rising protectionist pressures in the United States 
but he gave no hint in his speech to a Boston business audience 
about the Fed's current thinking on the economy and inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had expected a fifth straight decline in home sales in  
April, contending that rising mortgage rates were cooling off what 
had been a red hot housing market. But the report showed strong 
sales in every region of the country except the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales surged 33.5 percent to an annual rate of 211,000 units in  
the Midwest. Sales were up 17.1 percent to a rate of 89,000 units 
in the Northeast and climbed 7.5 percent to a rate of 429,000 units 
in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	The West, which had seen sales jump 22.9 percent in the previous  
month, suffered a drop of 5.3 percent in April to an annual rate of 
249,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be the cooling-off pattern that we thought was  
developing hasn't really developed and it may in fact take the 
higher rates to hold for a little bit to truly cool this market 
down,'' said economist David Seiders with the National Association 
of Home Builders. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts believe that a 3.3 percent decline in existing  
homes sales in April and a sharp 2.4 percent decrease in 
construction spending -- including single-family homes -- for the 
same month were signaling a slowdown in housing activity.

<HEADLINE> Airline Installing Medical Devices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Delta Air Lines, disclosing that one of its own  
flight attendants was saved with a defibrillator, is speeding up 
deployment of the cardiac emergency devices. 
</P>
<P>
	By June 30, six months ahead of schedule, all 584 Delta aircraft  
will carry the external defibrillators -- which deliver electrical 
shocks to restore normal heart rhythm -- and an expanded emergency 
medical kit. 
</P>
<P>
	The carrier had begun deploying the defibrillators, manufactured  
by Seattle-based Hewlett Packard Heartstream Operation, last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta said Wednesday a 40-year-old flight attendant suffered  
cardiac arrest on a flight from Salt Lake City bound for New 
Orleans two weeks ago. Other flight attendants and two nurses on 
board who volunteered to help treated her while the plane returned 
to Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight attendant, whose name wasn't released, is recovering  
well, Delta said.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Phone Rate Plan Put on Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A telephone rate plan that could lead to  
increased charges for Internet users in California has been put on 
hold again by state regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Public Utilities Commission is set to vote Thursday on  
billing arrangements for Internet hookups between Pacific Bell and 
a smaller phone company, a $50 million dispute that could 
eventually be passed along to Web surfers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pacific Bell spokesman Bill Mashek said the PUC would not  
immediately consider the company's plan to eliminate 
interconnection fees owed to the smaller firm, Pac-West Telecomm, 
by reclassifying Internet calls as long-distance calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the commission will vote either to reaffirm its current  
rules or to open up the issue for a full review, as some lawmakers 
have urged. 
</P>
<P>
	A delay would give Gov. Gray Davis more time to fill two  
vacancies on the five-member PUC. Both seats were appointed by 
former Gov. Pete Wilson and had voted with the majority in October. 
</P>
<P>
	The eventual decision could set a precedent for other carriers  
that serve 600 Internet service providers in California. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute involves Internet calls that start with the caller's  
local carrier, a field dominated by Pacific Bell. The call is 
passed along to the Internet service provider's carrier, typically 
a smaller company like Pac-West. 
</P>
<P>
	For handling the remainder of the call, Pacific Bell has been  
required, under past agreements, to pay a fee to Pac-West. 
</P>
<P>
	That arrangement was designed for the expected increase in  
competition among local carriers. When Internet traffic flourished 
among small phone companies, Pacific Bell protested that the fees 
were an improper subsidy and that the calls, often destined for 
remote Web sites, were long-distance calls for which no fee was 
required under their agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacific Bell started withholding its fee from Pac-West two years  
ago and has built up $50 million in an escrow account while the PUC 
considers its appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Bryson, Pac-West's chief financial officer, has said his  
company would have to increase rates to Internet service providers 
if it lost the Pacific Bell fees. The ISPs could then raise monthly 
fees to Internet callers. 
</P>
<P>
	After a PUC vote in October to leave the interconnection fees  
intact, the Federal Communications Commission weighed in by 
declaring in January that Internet calls were long distance. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the FCC specified that Internet callers would not have  
to pay long-distance rates and that state regulatory agencies 
remained free to allocate costs between the companies.

<HEADLINE> Widow Receives 57-Year-Old Letter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COVINA, Calif. (AP) -- When Lenore Barnes finally opened the  
long-lost envelope mailed by her late husband 57 years ago, her 
hands trembled, and tears welled up in her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	But her joyful anticipation soon turned to bitter disappointment  
when she saw what was inside: a blank USO postcard. 
</P>
<P>
	``How awful,'' the 76-year-old widow said Wednesday after  
perusing the contents of the Federal Express delivery. ``What a 
dud. After all these tears, I wanted an `I love you,' `I miss you' 
or `I wish you were in my arms.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Barnes had waited for the letter sent by husband Bill since  
it surfaced in the hands of a Sparks, Nev., teacher who bought it 
at an antique paper show two months ago. The teacher sent it to her 
unopened. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than addresses and mailing notations, the only message on  
the card was an old wartime security slogan printed in red letters: 
``Idle gossip sinks ships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Barnes said the mailing was typical of her husband, an avid  
envelope, stamp and coin collector. As she opened the letter, she 
said: ``Bill has always told me how to correctly open letters. This 
letter-opener I'm using is too dull.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Barnes died two years ago at the age of 81. He had sent the  
letter to his fiancee in New York City in 1942, while he was at 
Fort Lewis, Wash., but it got lost in the mail. The couple married 
a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes served in Europe in 1944 and 1945. After the war, the  
couple lived in New York, where Barnes was a plumber. In 1963, the 
couple moved to Los Angeles, where Barnes worked in construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Where the envelope had been all these years remains a mystery.  
It bore the notation ``Received at Los Angeles, Calif., under cover 
from post office at Fort Lewis, Wash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Middle-school history teacher Bernard Lund bought the envelope  
in April. He said he was intrigued by the ink stamp and didn't 
realize at first that it contained something. 
</P>
<P>
	His students urged him to open the letter, then changed their  
minds during a talk about privacy. After news of the letter leaked 
out, a reporter tracked down Mrs. Barnes. 
</P>
<P>
	As Mrs. Barnes tried to handle her disappointment, her youngest  
of three daughters, Michelle Hendricks, 33, told her it was a sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dad's just making sure you know that he's fine,'' she said.  
``He's telling you from heaven that he loves you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Barnes said the anticipation had taken its toll and she  
would give the card back to the teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to send them some history,'' she said. ``I'll finish  
it up that way.''

<HEADLINE> `Home Improvement' Goes Out on Top / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tim Allen's ``Home Improvement'' won the battle  
of the farewell episodes. 
</P>
<P>
	The final episode of the long-running ABC comedy was easily last  
week's most-watched show. Much to ABC's surprise and delight, it 
was the fourth-highest rated series finale of the 1990s behind 
``Seinfeld,'' ``Cheers'' and ``The Cosby Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, NBC scored a narrow prime-time victory for the week and  
won the May ``sweeps'' period, when ratings are watched closely to 
set local advertising rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Home Improvement'' drew an estimated 35.5 million viewers,  
Nielsen Media Research said Wednesday. The final episode of NBC's 
``Mad About You'' was fourth for the week with nearly 20 million 
viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	The finale of Fox's ``Melrose Place'' had a more lackluster  
showing, finishing in 37th place for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one show -- ``Frasier'' -- from NBC's normally powerful  
Thursday night lineup made Nielsen's top 10 for the week. All were 
repeats as the long summer rerun season begins. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, NBC had a 7.8 rating and 14 share. ABC and CBS  
both had 7.5 ratings and 14 shares, though ABC had the edge in 
total viewers. Fox had a 5.7 rating and 11 share, and the WB was at 
3.2 and 6. Struggling UPN had a 1.7 rating and 3 share, while Pax 
TV was at 0.7 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``World News Tonight'' won the evening news competition  
with a 7.1 rating and 17 share. NBC's ``Nightly News'' was at 7.0 
and 16, while the ``CBS Evening News'' was at 5.7 and 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nightly News'' claimed victory during May sweeps, with its  
ratings up slightly from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of May 24-30, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were ``Home Improvement,'' ABC, 21.6; ``Spin City,'' ABC, 
14.3; ``Law and Order,'' NBC, 13.9; ``Mad About You,'' NBC, ``NYPD 
Blue,'' ABC, 13.5; ``Law and Order'' special, NBC, 11.9; ``Dateline 
NBC-Monday,'' NBC, 10.9; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 10.7; ``ABC Monday Night 
Movie: Cleopatra, Part Two,'' ABC, 10.0; ``Ally McBeal,'' Fox, 
10.0.

<HEADLINE> Century of Stars: Fay Wray </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The way they wore their hair, spoke their lines or held a  
cigarette was mimicked by millions. They were movie stars -- the	
20th century's new royalty -- and the world couldn't get enough of	
them. Following is the second in an occasional series of interviews	
with some of the performers who helped define stardom in this	
century.	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- When Tennessee Williams met Fay Wray for the  
first time, he clasped her hand and murmured, ``I'm glad you got 
away from that big ape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But at 91, she still hasn't escaped. She's still in the palm of  
her adoring co-star in countless television showings of the 1933 
classic ``King Kong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She long ago became reconciled to being identified by a single  
film out of the 80 she made during her long career, and she even 
gave her 1988 autobiography the whimsical title ``On the Other 
Hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Miss Wray deserves to be considered a star of the century  
for more than one unforgettable movie. Her career dates back to 
1919, with her debut at age 12 in ``Blind Husbands.'' She is one of 
a handful of remaining Hollywood figures who starred in silent 
films, her most notable being Erich von Stroheim's ``The Wedding 
March.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fay Wray -- her real name and not a studio invention -- has  
witnessed virtually the entire history of Hollywood. She arrived 
when producers were pouring in from the East for the sunshine and 
scenery. She starred in silents and talkies, saw the rise and fall 
of the big studios, took part in the TV revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	She has seen a host of changes in both the Hollywood landscape  
and the business, including the advent of the $20 million star. She 
worked on ``King Kong'' off and on for 10 months, earning $10,000. 
She also appeared in 10 other films in 1933-- ``every fourth Monday 
we started a new picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Miss Wray lives alone in a Century City high-rise  
apartment she shared with her third husband, neurosurgeon Sandy 
Rothenberg, who died in 1991. She is lovely as ever, possessing the 
same high cheeks and eyes that twinkle when she laughs, which is 
often. Her only concession to age is a cane for a gimpy leg. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen a lot,'' she volunteered in her clear, sultry voice.  
``It's been a wonderful span of time. I think the older we get -- as 
long as we keep going -- the more fun it is. All three of my 
children are interesting, talented, gifted, pretty well behaved. 
Very well behaved, I would say. I also have two grandchildren: a 
boy, Jacob, and a girl, Nora, and they're darling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She hasn't acted since the 1980 TV movie ``Gideon's Trumpet''  
with Henry Fonda. Instead, she has found a new pastime: appearing 
at special screenings of her favorite movie. No, not the one with 
the lovesick gorilla -- ``The Wedding March,'' of course, in which 
the Viennese director starred as a prince who runs from an arranged 
marriage into the arms of a poor girl -- Fay Wray. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a kid anymore,'' she said. ``But I want you to know I  
have been very active in the last couple of years. I went to a film 
festival at Pine Bluff, Ark. It was a beautiful experience because 
the people were so very nice, warmhearted and kind. I cherish the 
memory of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They showed 'The Wedding March,' and I appeared and talked  
about that. I loved the opportunity because it's a distinguished 
picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year she was flown on the Concorde to London, where she  
stayed at the Savoy Hotel and appeared for a capacity screening of 
``The Wedding March,'' with a special score played by the London 
Philharmonic Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	One of five children, she was born in Wrayville (founded by her  
family) in Alberta, Canada, where her parents lived in a log cabin. 
When she was 3, the family moved to Arizona ``to get warm.'' Days 
of 120 degrees were a little too warm, however, and when the 
parents broke up, mother and children went to Salt Lake City. But 
the winters there proved harmful to Fay's chronic tonsillitis, and 
at 14 she was sent off to Los Angeles with a family friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hollywood was a small town then, everybody knew everybody,''  
she recalled. ``So naturally I got to know a lot of movie people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While she was a student at Hollywood High School, she earned  
money as an extra and stand-in on films, soon graduating to bit 
parts. Her big break came with a sea picture, ``The Coast Patrol,'' 
in 1925. ``The producer wanted to change my name to June Darling,'' 
she recalled. ``I had the guts to say no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She followed with a herd of low-budget Westerns with titles like  
``Loco Luck'' and ``Spurs and Saddles.'' Then came the star-making 
role in ``The Wedding March,'' in which she played von Stroheim's 
love interest. It was released in 1928 when the film industry was 
in a turmoil over the advent of sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike many silent stars, Miss Wray had no trouble converting to  
talkies. An independent producer had sold her contract to the giant 
Paramount Pictures, which tested her voice along with William 
Powell, Richard Arlen and others. All qualified. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not really happy when sound came in,'' she commented.  
``I believed that the art of the silent film had a special quality 
to it and that sound might spoil that. And I think that in a sense 
it did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The early talkies brought her roles as the woman in jeopardy in  
such films as ``Dr. X,'' ``The Vampire Bat'' and ``The Mystery of 
the Wax Museum.'' Her eloquent scream made her perfect casting for 
``King Kong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She decided long ago not to complain about having her name  
forever attached to a monkey. King Kong, she says, turned to be ``a 
good P.R. person'' for her. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, ``Now that I have looked at the picture seriously, I think  
that he was very touching. There have been a lot of attitudes 
expressed about King Kong. Now there's a heartbeat of affection for 
him. It hurts me to see him shot down,'' she says, referring to the 
climactic scene where the ape falls from the Empire State Building 
to his death. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Producer and co-director Merian C. Cooper planned to film the  
final sequence atop New York City's Chrysler Building. He was in 
New York when the Empire State Building was being completed and 
decided it would be a better location. ``The Chrysler would have 
been too slippery,'' the actress observed. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper and co-director Ernest Schoedsack, adventurers both, flew  
the biplanes that finally conquered Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	The film makes it seem that Miss Wray was in great danger. Was  
she? 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' she said. ``I was just in a big hand. The action was  
done by people on the set with levers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 21, she married John Monk Saunders, a former army pilot who  
wrote books and scripts about flying. He was a brilliant, bedeviled 
man, an alcoholic who later turned to drugs. During their 10-year 
marriage, each had earned a half-million dollars. When she finally 
left him in 1939, he had spent it all. Six months later he hanged 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1942, she married Robert Riskin, who wrote most of Frank  
Capra's hits, including ``It Happened One Night,'' ``Lost Horizon'' 
and ``You Can't Take It With You.'' When he joined the Office of 
War Information during World War II, she quit her career to be with 
him in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Their marriage was idyllic. But in 1950 he underwent brain  
surgery, which ended his writing career. He died in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Wray, who has had a play produced and still writes stories,  
seemed to be attracted to writers. Between marriages she was wooed 
by novelist Sinclair Lewis but found him physically unattractive. 
Not so playwright Clifford Odets, with whom she had a torrid 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
	After Riskin's death, she resumed acting, this time in character  
roles for such films as ``The Cobweb,'' ``Queen Bee'' and ``Tammy 
and the Bachelor.'' She finally retired in 1959, emerging only for 
``Gideon's Trumpet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She'll be 92 in September. She spends half the year in Los  
Angeles, the rest at her apartment in New York, where she goes to 
the theater and visits friends and family. She is working on a 
one-act play which might turn out to be full-length, she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Does she have any regrets?  
</P>
<P>
	``Why should I?'' she responded. ``What would you think I should  
be regretful about? I've had a rich life, a full life, a very 
interesting life. And I feel very good remembering anything and 
everything.''

<HEADLINE> 3-Year-Old Watched Mother's Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGETON, N.J. (AP) -- A 3-year-old girl who tried to stop her  
pregnant mother from being killed by a burglar was then left alone 
with the body for 17 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Laquanda Fedd, 22, surprised a man who had broken into her home.  
During a struggle, her daughter Braizonna tried to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
	``He pushed me onto the floor,'' she said Wednesday. ``I hit him  
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said David Mosley, 24, of Bridgeton, grabbed a knife that  
was in the house and slashed Fedd's throat. He was charged 
Wednesday with murder, burglary and weapons charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Fedd, a single mother who worked two jobs and was four months  
pregnant, died at the scene. Her body lay undiscovered until Fedd's 
mother, alerted by the victim's employer that she missed work, went 
to check on her. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl was found hiding under a sheet in a bedroom when  
relatives came by the house on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear how the girl occupied herself after the killing.  
She told relatives she ate some peaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Braizonna seemed unfazed by the killing as she played outside  
her grandmother's home Wednesday. Relatives said they weren't sure 
the girl understood what she had seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw him. He was in my mom's room,'' she said. ``My mommy got  
a pink nose. I saw my mommy laying on the floor.''

<HEADLINE> Knicks Lack Ailing Ewing Vs. Pacers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Patrick Ewing's missed shot at the buzzer ended  
up being his last of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old center, who played through injuries all year,  
learned Wednesday that he has a partial tear of his left Achilles' 
tendon and will miss the rest of the season, a stunning blow to the 
New York Knicks and their quest for a championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing felt a ``ripping sensation'' during warmups before Game 2  
of the Eastern Conference finals against the Pacers in Indianapolis 
on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, he played, limping his way to 10 points and three  
rebounds in 25 minutes in the Pacers' 88-86 victory that evened the 
series. He had a chance to tie the game at the buzzer with a 
15-foot jumper but missed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing, criticized throughout his 14-year career for not bringing  
a title to New York, has been to the NBA Finals just once, when the 
Knicks lost to Houston in 1994. If his team returns this season, 
he'll have to watch from the bench in a suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating to work so hard and be so close to something  
I've dreamed about for so many years,'' Ewing said. ``To not be 
able to be on the floor to help my teammates is very frustrating 
and disappointing. But if my Achilles ruptures completely, it would 
end my career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tests on Wednesday confirmed the injury. Ewing, who will be in a  
cast for six weeks, does not need surgery and a full recovery is 
expected, said Dr. Norman Scott, the team's physician. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing was stunned when Scott delivered the news.  
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `You're kidding.' He didn't believe me,'' the doctor  
said. ``He was really depressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing has been struggling with the injury, diagnosed as  
tendinitis, all season. Scott said it was rare that tendinitis 
would develop into a tear. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11-time All-Star also has struggled with sore knees that  
need to be packed in ice after every game. He was out for most of 
last season with a broken wrist but came back in the second round 
of the playoffs, when New York lost to the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	His absence now makes the Knicks' job even more difficult  
against favored Indiana. New York is the first eighth-seeded team 
to make the conference finals, and the 7-foot Ewing was a big 
reason why, despite his injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	He played a significant role in the first two rounds of the  
playoffs when the Knicks upset Miami and Atlanta. In New York's 
Game 1 victory over the Pacers, he played 40 minutes, scoring 16 
points and grabbing 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patrick has been on this journey,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy said.  
``The reason he plays today is to win a championship. It is the 
reason he fought through a lot of pain to try and help. I feel bad 
for him. It's as if he's been cheated out of another opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the Pacers sounded as if they would miss him.  
</P>
<P>
	``I could see he was hurting,'' said Mark Jackson, once Ewing's  
teammate. ``I'm proud of him. He's a warrior. A lot of guys 
wouldn't have even suited up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Reggie Miller: ``It's a shame because Patrick is such a  
great competitor and has been a huge part of this great rivalry and 
the great games the two teams have played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gundy wasn't sure what adjustments he would make, although Chris  
Dudley was expected to take Ewing's spot at center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is not about what we do in the future,'' Van Gundy said.  
``Today is about Patrick Ewing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing, in the second year of a four-year, $68 million contract,  
averaged 17.3 points and 9.9 rebounds in the regular season. He 
missed 12 games because of his sore Achilles' tendon. During the 
playoffs he averaged 13.1 points and 8.7 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments after Ewing walked off the floor after his miss in Game  
2, Miller teased him in the news conference. Miller, who hit two 
foul shots to win the game, was asked about his shooting just as 
Ewing entered the interview room. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as you make the last one, that's all that matters,''  
Miller said. ``Right, Pat?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither of them realized at the time that Ewing would not take  
another shot for the rest of the season.

<HEADLINE> Analysts Not Fazed by Rite Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP HILL, Pa. (AP) -- A reduction in Rite Aid Corp. earnings for  
the past three years, prompted by a Securities and Exchange 
Commission review of Rite Aid's accounting practices, is no cause 
for alarm over the finances of the nation's third-largest drugstore 
chain, according to market analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	``No big deal,'' said analyst Eric Bosshard of Midwest Research.  
``There were some small issues that they were able to tidy up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This doesn't reflect badly on the company. It's simply a  
result of an unusual period,'' said Sally H. Wallick, an analyst 
with Legg Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors responded to Rite Aid's restatement of its earnings  
for fiscal 1997, 1998 and 1999 -- made in an SEC filing Tuesday -- by 
pushing shares down more than 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Rite Aid dropped $2.50 to $24.18 3/4 in trading on the  
New York Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the company's new, more conservative accounting methods,  
Rite Aid's income for the fiscal year that ended Feb. 27 was 
reduced by $14.3 million, or 5 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised earnings amounted to a reduction of 4 cents a share  
for fiscal 1998, and an increase of 1 cent in net per-share 
earnings for fiscal 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The revisions primarily affect how the company accounted for  
expenses related to recent acquisitions, store openings and the 
closing of smaller stores and distribution centers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock has plummeted nearly 50 percent this year as  
a result of weaker-than-expected earnings during the fourth quarter 
of fiscal 1999.

<HEADLINE> Speedway Sued After Debris Kills Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE (AP) -- Lowe's Motor Speedway and the Indy Racing  
League have been sued by the family of a man killed by flying 
debris during a May 1 open-wheel auto race. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys representing Dexter Barry Mobley's three children, who  
live in Georgia, filed the lawsuit in Mecklenburg Superior Court, 
seeking unspecified monetary damages from the track owners, the IRL 
and the speedway's president, H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler. 
</P>
<P>
	Mobley, 41, of Statesville was one of three spectators at the  
IRL's Visionaire 500 who died after a wheel and other debris flew 
over safety fences and into the grandstand following a crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claims IRL, Wheeler and Speedway Motorsports Inc.  
were negligent in protecting fans. The defendants ``knew or should 
have known'' that allowing the fast open-wheel cars to race at 
Lowe's Motor Speedway -- a track designed for heavier, slower stock 
cars -- was ``inherently dangerous and heightened the risk of a 
serious crash,'' the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Beauchamp of Albany, Ga., lead attorney for Mobley's  
estate, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Sunday the 
lawsuit, filed Friday, was the first step toward ``putting the 
whole industry on trial'' for not adequately protecting spectators 
when mixing IRL-style cars with NASCAR-style tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've talked to the attorneys in Michigan, and we've agreed to  
put the whole industry on trial,'' Beauchamp told the Atlanta 
newspaper. ``Between Michigan and the Visionaire 500 (at Lowe's 
Motor Speedway), why didn't they do anything to improve safety? Six 
people shouldn't have to die to change something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten months before the May 1 accident, three fans were killed  
during a similar open-wheel auto race at Michigan Speedway in 
Brooklyn, Mich. Both the Lowe's and Michigan speedways are 
banked-oval tracks with turns designed for the stock cars. 
Open-wheel cars generally race on flatter courses, such as the 
Indianapolis Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Speedway officials declined to comment on the lawsuit. Lauri  
Wilks, vice president and general counsel for Speedway Motorsports 
Inc., said Wheeler and SMI officials had not yet received copies of 
the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as we are concerned, we are continuing to work with the  
families, to see to all their needs and help them in whatever way 
we can,'' Wilks said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claims Wheeler told reporters after the Michigan  
crash that the Charlotte-area track should consider increasing the 
fence height. Since the May 1 accident, Lowe's Motor Speedway has 
raised the fence on parts of the track to 21 feet.

<HEADLINE> Weakened AIDS Virus Still Damaging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Several people in Australia who caught a weakened form of HIV in  
the early 1980s are showing AIDS-like damage to their immune 
systems, a development with disappointing implications in the 
search for a vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1980 and 1984, 13 people in Australia received blood  
donated by an HIV-infected man, and eight of them caught the virus. 
When none got sick, researchers analyzed the virus and found that 
it was missing a working copy of a gene called nef, which boosts 
HIV reproduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, three of the infected people died of other  
causes, and none has gotten AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	Some researchers had hoped that a vaccine modeled on the weak  
virus could be an effective AIDS vaccine, protecting people for 
life without making them sick. The idea would be to create a 
vaccine using a weakened version of HIV that is missing nef and 
probably other genes. Studies in monkeys suggest that this may 
protect animals from getting the simian version of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some of the Australians now appear to show weakening  
immune defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the donor and five surviving transfusion recipients, three  
have falling levels of helper T cells, a hallmark of AIDS damage. 
In January, the donor whose blood infected the others began taking 
AIDS drugs because of his low blood count. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australians are known as the Sydney Blood Bank Cohort. A  
report on them was published in today's New England Journal of 
Medicine by Jennifer Learmont and others from the Australian Red 
Cross Blood Service. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Drs. Kathleen Collins of the  
University of Michigan and Gary Nabel of the National Institutes of 
Health said the experience provides ``another cautionary note'' 
about the use of a live but weakened HIV strain as a vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	``If large populations of uninfected persons were given this  
virus, there would almost certainly be unacceptable risks,'' they 
wrote.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Gretzky Mull Legends Golf  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three retired superstars -- Michael Jordan, Wayne  
Gretzky and John Elway -- will join Fred Couples in an 18-hole 
challenge golf match, Golfweek Magazine reported on its web site 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The program, tentatively titled, ``Legends at Play,'' will  
feature the three retirees from the NBA, NHL and NFL, respectively, 
playing a best-ball format against Couples at Shadow Hawk Golf Club 
in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Its pretty much a done deal,'' Couples was quoted as saying.  
``I think its going to be a really fun thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couples not only thought of the idea, but was responsible for  
recruiting the three superstars. He also approached Jack Nicklaus 
Productions about producing the event, which will be televised on 
Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	The contest will be taped around Thanksgiving and will air on  
Christmas Day. There will be no prize money. Any proceeds go to 
charity. 
</P>
<P>
	Couples, an enthusiastic sports fan, said he has played with  
Jordan three or four times and with Elway once, but has never teed 
it up with Gretzky. Asked if the trio filled out his dream 
foursome, Couples smiled and said, ``pretty much. They're guys I'm 
going to love to play with. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of them retired, then another, then another, and it just  
struck me,'' Couples said, describing how the idea came to him. 
``It just struck me as something that made so much sense, seeing

everyone.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Skeptical of AOL E-Mails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge expressed skepticism Wednesday that  
e-mails cited by Microsoft about the $10 billion alliance of two of 
its biggest rivals actually indicate they plan to threaten the 
software giant's dominance in the computer industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Internal documents disclosed about America Online Inc.'s  
purchase earlier this year of Netscape Communications Corp. 
appeared to contradict public statements by executives at both 
companies about the impetus for the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a surprise move, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield  
Jackson stopped Microsoft's attorney in mid-sentence to complain 
that the documents were ``ambiguous or cryptic'' about whether they 
suggested AOL had plans to compete more directly with Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft contends that the alliance of AOL and Netscape, with a  
related agreement with Sun Microsystems Inc., demonstrates that the 
company faces healthy competition and is not the monopolist 
described by government lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge allowed that the e-mails raised doubts about testimony  
Wednesday from a government witness, economist Franklin Fisher, who 
said he doesn't believe AOL will choose to distribute its newly 
acquired Netscape Internet software to its more than 17 million 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	An e-mail in July from Sun employee Woody Mewborn, after a  
meeting with AOL executives, said that AOL's most recent software 
``will be the last Microsoft WindowsInternet Explorer 4.0 
version.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mewborn added that a new version of AOL's software, which won't  
use Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser software, was 18 to 24 
months away, and was aimed at ``breaking (AOL's) deadly embrace 
with Microsoft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It does call into question the accuracy of (Fisher's) forecast  
into that question,'' the judge told Microsoft lawyer Michael 
Lacovara, adding: ``The point's been made. You don't have to go any 
further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Jackson also said the documents weren't a clear indicator  
that AOL plans to compete with Microsoft as directly as the 
software giant maintains. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure what your strategy is here,'' Jackson told  
Lacovara. ``A number of these are ambiguous or cryptic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson also complained separately that the AOL-related  
documents, including e-mails and slide presentations, were dated 
last fall or earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the documents appeared to contradict statements by AOL  
Chairman Steve Case and others, who maintained that AOL was more 
interested in buying Netscape's popular Web site than its popular 
Internet browser software. 
</P>
<P>
	Case told Microsoft lawyers last month that AOL ``did not buy  
Netscape because of the browser business. We bought Netscape in 
some ways despite the browser business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a slide presentation from AOL's investment bankers last  
November repeatedly describes the company's upcoming plans for the 
Netscape browser, including a proposal to ``extend browser to be a 
more comprehensive desktop application ... with the goal of 
becoming user's de facto environment.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks End Slightly Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo stock market's main index climbed  
slightly today for the third straight day on expectations that the 
government may stimulate Japan's economy with a new set of 
measures. The dollar slipped against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.54 yen at late afternoon, down 0.57 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also lower than its late New York 
level of 120.56 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 9.49 points,  
or 0.06 percent, closing the day at 16,417.99. On Tuesday, the 
index rose 296.85 points, or 1.84 percent, on top of Monday's 
138.97 point gain. 
</P>
<P>
	For much of today's trading, stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange  
moved in a tight range in lackluster trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the Nikkei's upside was limited as investors locked  
in profits in reaction to Tuesday's rally and following a 
2.4-percent plunge in the technology rich U.S. Nasdaq Composite 
Index overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said, however, that the market's downside was firmly  
supported by hopes that the government will come up with new 
measures to stimulate Japan's economy ahead of the June 19 meeting 
of the Group of Eight major industrialized nations in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fears of a sharp fall in the Nikkei have abated,'' said  
Hiroichi Nishi, general manager at Nikko Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Investor sentiment improved somewhat following a report Tuesday  
in a small Japanese investment newspaper saying that Prime Minister 
Keizo Obuchi may decide later this month to suspend Japan's 
unpopular 5-percent national sales tax. Several government 
officials later strongly denied the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 434  
million shares, compared with Tuesday's turnover of 433 million 
shares. Advancers outnumbered 743 to 429, with 137 issues 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section finished up 9.29 points, or 0.71 percent, to 
1,326.77. The TOPIX rose 20.29 points, or 1.56 percent, the 
previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar mostly followed its overnight  
trend in New York, where it fell as inflation fears pushed down 
U.S. stock and bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar came under renewed selling pressure after a stronger  
than expected manufacturing report on Tuesday increased speculation 
the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to cool the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Purchasing Management said its price  
index rose to 52.2 in May from 49.9 in April, leading analysts and 
investors to interpret that as an indication that inflation was 
revving up. 
</P>
<P>
	Although higher interest rates typically are supportive of a  
nation's currency, in this case they are felt to mean that 
businesses will have a harder time getting loans to conduct 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Helping to cap the dollar's upside was euro selling against the  
Japanese currency, said Ryohei Muramatsu, treasury manager at 
Commerzbank in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro's problems, partly because of slowing economic growth  
in Europe, were exacerbated by a decision by the 11-member European 
Union last week to allow Italy to increase its budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	At late afternoon today, the euro was quoted at 124.78 yen, down  
from 126.28 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese  
government bond rose to 1.6750 percent from Tuesday's finish of 
1.6050 percent, driving its price down to 97.64 yen from 98.23 yen 
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Kuehne Is Just Another LPGA Golfer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST POINT, Miss. (AP) -- Kelli Kuehne was once proclaimed as the  
LPGA's version of Tiger Woods. The comparisons then were 
unavoidable. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuehne, like Woods, won back-to-back U.S. Amateur titles in 1995  
and 1996 and had a deal with Nike even before turning pro. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike Woods, professional golf began as a humbling  
experience for Kuehne. She enters Thursday's opening round of the 
54th U.S. Women's Open having just won her first professional 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was a big year of growing pains. It was not a fun  
year for me,'' Kuehne said, recalling her rookie season. ``I had a 
lot to learn. It's no longer just golf. This is your way of life 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods won a Masters and millions of dollars before Kuehne earned  
her LPGA card for the 1998 season. Woods had 11 career victories 
before Kuehne won the LPGA Corning Classic last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard trying to establish yourself and I have struggled  
with that,'' said Kuehne, whose older brother Hank won the U.S. 
amateur last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came out here, it was great that I had a great amateur  
record, but it didn't do anything for me in the professional 
ranks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a rookie last year, Kuehne played in seven tournaments before  
she made a cut and earned a paycheck. She won just $39,831 in 24 
events and lost her exempt status on Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	After those struggles, Kuehne realized that she was putting too  
much pressure on herself. Golf was not fun anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	So she changed her approach.  
</P>
<P>
	While practicing at Old Wavelry Golf Club this week, the  
22-year-old chatted with spectators and playing partners while 
walking the fairways. She whistled while she putted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of lost my zip and I lost my flare last year,'' Kuehne  
said. ``This year, I made a big issue of coming out and trying to 
have some fun. 
</P>
<P>
	``In golf, it seems like the harder you try the worse it gets.  
And it's one of the most frustrating things about the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There have been few frustrations for Kuehne in the last month.  
</P>
<P>
	To get a spot in her first U.S. Women's Open, she shot a 68  
during a qualifying tournament at Austin, Texas, on May 18. That 
was just a stroke behind 20-year LPGA veteran Beth Daniel, who 
earned her 23rd Open appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Just five days after the Open qualifying, Kuehne finished  
seventh at the Phillips Invitational and got a $22,342 check, then 
the largest in her career. She topped that with the Corning victory 
and $112,500, assuring an LPGA exemption for at least three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't get the rookie blast anymore because I'm in my second  
year, but it was pretty neat for a couple of girls to say, `You got 
yours, now I'm waiting to get mine,''' Kuehne said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to know that I still have the same instinct that I  
had during my amateur days because that's been missing,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Blazers' Rider Vows To Be Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- After strong performances in the first two  
rounds of the playoffs, Isaiah Rider of the Portland Trail Blazers 
was happy to at last be recognized for his basketball ability 
instead of his off-court problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Things haven't gone so well for him, though, in the Western  
Conference finals. Rider scored 16 points in the two games in San 
Antonio, half of them in the third quarter of Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	To make matters worse, his already sore right knee locked up in  
the third quarter of Game 2. And, much to his obvious displeasure, 
he didn't play at all in the fourth quarter, when San Antonio 
rallied for an 86-85 victory to take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-7 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just didn't look like he was playing at the same level  
physically,'' Portland coach Mike Dunleavy said. ``He may at times 
thought he was OK. But it looked like he was thinking about his 
knee a whole lot, rubbing it, favoring it a little bit, not running 
as hard as he could run. Maybe it didn't look that way to anybody 
else but it was kind of noticeable to me. I look for him to come 
back and have a big third game for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rider said after his team's workout Wednesday that he will be  
ready to play when the series resumes Friday night at Portland's 
Rose Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just really sore,'' he said. ``It just locked up on me. I  
popped it out and made it swell and made it really sore. It has a 
spot there that's really tender. It's just a freak thing really.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The injury occurred in the first round against Phoenix, when Tom  
Gugliotta jumped into Rider's knee going for a loose ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider averaged 19 points per game in the Blazers' series  
victories against Phoenix and Utah, and he said he is accepting his 
more limited role against San Antonio, when Portland has focused on 
the matchup advantages Rasheed Wallace has at forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course I want the ball, that's just me,'' Rider said. ``I'd  
like to turn it up at any point in time. But I don't want to go out 
there and take all kinds of crazy shots just because I did well in 
the first two series. I still want to play in the confines of our 
team and not be an outcast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same could be said for Damon Stoudamire, who hates the fact  
that Dunleavy usually benches him in the fourth quarter in favor of 
Greg Anthony. When Stoudamire finally did get to play down the 
stretch in Game 2, he hit several jumpers but also had a big 
turnover and missed a critical free throw. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I sit in the fourth quarter, I won't be happy. That's just  
the bottom line,'' Stoudamire said. ``I'm going to accept it but I 
won't be happy about it. ... I'll get over this, but I'm never 
going to forget it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, Dunleavy said that the decision on who plays in the  
fourth quarter will be based on matchups and how each player is 
doing to that point. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Grant left the Blazers' practice early because of illness.  
Dunleavy said it was an upper respiratory problem and Grant should 
be able to play Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunleavy had an easy summation of how the Blazers got down two  
games despite outplaying San Antonio for much of the first two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably should be 1-1,'' he said. ``With a little luck, we  
could be 2-0. With a little luck, they are 2-0.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs worked out in San Antonio Wednesday before flying to  
Portland. Antonio Daniels stayed home with what doctors think is 
strep throat. He is to fly to Portland on Friday but is 
questionable for Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs expressed caution as the series shifted to Portland.  
San Antonio has beaten the Blazers five in a row, but every game 
has been close, none more so than Game 2 Monday night, when Sean 
Elliott's tip-toe 3-pointer from the sideline made the difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just know we can't keep relying on last-second shots to beat  
Portland,'' Avery Johnson said, ``because sooner or later, it runs 
out. You've got to play solid basketball for 48 minutes. We didn't 
play for 48 minutes. That's why I thought we had a serious sense of 
concentration in practice today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going up there humbled, knowing that we haven't played  
our best basketball yet.''

<HEADLINE> Jury Ruling Favors Tobacco Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELLISVILLE, Miss. (AP) -- The tobacco industry is not liable for  
the cancer that killed a barber, despite his claims the disease was 
caused by decades of secondhand smoke from his customers, a jury 
ruled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury deliberated about two hours before rejecting the $650  
million damage lawsuit first filed by the late Burl Butler of 
Laurel and continued by his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the Butler family argued that it was the secondhand  
smoke the barber breathed for 30 years that caused his cancer and 
death in 1994 at age 60. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco lawyers argued that Butler had a family history of  
cancer and the barber had also been exposed to asbestos in talcum 
power and methylene chloride in hair spray used in his shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Furr, an attorney for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., said it  
was difficult for doctors to determine how individuals develop 
cancer, particularly in a case where there were several lifestyle 
risk factors. 
</P>
<P>
	T. Roe Frazer, the Butler family attorney, said he was  
disappointed ``but I still believe we are right and environmental 
smoke is deadly. It's just sad that this jury didn't feel like it 
needed to make that statement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ava Dean Butler, the barber's 62-year-old widow, said her  
husband hoped to make a contribution to society with his lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been very hard but my mission has not changed,'' she  
said. ``This has been a public awareness campaign from the 
beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other defendants were Philip Morris Tobacco Co., Brown &AMP;  
Williamson Tobacco Corp., Lorillard, Liggett Group and the former 
American Tobacco Co. 
</P>
<P>
	A previous class-action lawsuit brought by thousands of Florida  
flight attendants who claimed that working on smoky airplanes made 
them sick was settled mid-trial for $349 million in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	And an Indiana jury in 1998 found the tobacco industry not  
liable for the death of a nonsmoking nurse.

<HEADLINE> ABC Defends Purchase of Video </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC says it has no regrets about paying $16,000  
for videotapes and photographs of one of the Columbine High School 
gunmen, but promised to explain the transaction to viewers if the 
material is seen again. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the pictures were shown last week on ``Good Morning  
America'' along with an interview of Nathan Dykeman, a friend of 
Dylan Klebold. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC insisted it wasn't paying for an interview, since Dykeman  
appeared earlier on ``Good Morning America'' to talk about his 
friendship with Klebold. At the time, ABC was not aware of the 
videos and photographs, spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would never pay money for videotapes or home videos with  
the proviso that we get an interview. We felt this material was 
editorially useful. We thought that it explained more about the 
story,'' Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dykeman was brought back after the sale to explain what his  
material showed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold and classmate Eric Harris gunned down 13 people at the  
Colorado school on April 20 before shooting themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC bought broadcast rights to home video of Dykeman driving to  
school with Klebold, during which the boys joke about blowing up 
the high school. Another video, part of a school project, shows 
Klebold dressed in a trench coat and pouring lighter fluid on the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Dykeman's school yearbook also shows disturbing messages written  
by Harris and Klebold, including the words ``kill them all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the interview, ABC correspondent Don Dahler said on the  
air that the network had ``obtained the rights'' to the material. 
</P>
<P>
	``To us, that means we paid for it,'' Murphy said. ``But perhaps  
that's not as clear as it should be. 
</P>
<P>
	The material could be used again, perhaps on Friday when ``Good  
Morning America'' airs a town meeting on teen-age violence with 
President Clinton at the White House. If it is, ABC will make clear 
that it paid for the videos and photos, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert on media ethics said that some news organizations pay  
for outside material, such as video of a tornado. But if it's 
something out of the ordinary -- as it was in this case -- the 
network should disclose the arrangement to viewers, said Bob Steele 
of the Poynter Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele said the payment disturbed him, since it appeared someone  
was profiting from a tangential involvement in a tragedy. Even 
worse, it raises the prospect of an unseemly bidding war. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's troubling to me that ABC becomes a partner in that kind  
of decision,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  9 Die in Ark. Plane Crash Landing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- An American Airlines flight with 145  
people aboard skidded off a runway while landing during a gusty 
hail storm, broke apart and burst into flames. Nine people were 
killed, including the pilot, and more than 80 were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The deaths in the crash just before midnight Tuesday were the  
first on a major U.S. airline in nearly 1 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
	After sliding down the rain-slickened runway, the twin-engine  
Super MD-80 slammed into a steel light tower, split into pieces, 
caught fire and wound up on the edge of the Arkansas River. 
</P>
<P>
	A violent downpour, steady winds of 50 mph and gusts of up to 75  
mph were reported across the river just before the plane landed, 
with a peak gust of 87 mph six minutes after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``The scenario that the storm approached one end of the runway  
as the plane approached from the other probably is correct,'' said 
George Wilken, meteorologist with the National Weather Service. But 
he said he did not know if the bad weather caused the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	As flames spread through the plane, some passengers squeezed one  
by one through an emergency exit while others escaped through 
openings created when the plane's fuselage fractured. They 
scrambled away from the plane across lowlands near the river in 
darkness, rain and hail. 
</P>
<P>
	``We grabbed each other and ran away,'' said Missy Lewis,  
traveling with her husband and teen-age daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Malcolm, the Pulaski County coroner, confirmed that nine  
people had been killed in the crash of Flight 1420 from Dallas. 
Other than the pilot, they were not immediately identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline identified the pilot as Capt. Richard Buschmann, the  
airline's chief pilot in Chicago. First Officer Michael Origel and 
a flight attendant suffered broken legs. Another flight attendant 
had hip or pelvic injuries. Two others in the flight crew escaped 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Altogether, at least 83 people were injured and taken to  
hospitals. Fifty-one others did not require hospital treatment. Two 
people were not immediately accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't know if anyone on impact was thrown into the  
swamp,'' American Airlines spokesman John Hotard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett Baber, a student at Ouachita Baptist University at  
Arkadelphia, said the plane made a fast approach to the airport as 
lightning raged. Hail pelted him once he got out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plane was going so fast, when we hit the ground, we went  
off the end of the runway,'' Baber said at a theater-aerospace 
museum near the airport where survivors were taken to meet with 
families and friends. ``We hit a huge pole, and it split the plane 
in half. A fire started at the front of the plane and spread back. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Snowden, a district fire chief, said the plane hit a steel  
tower supporting the runway's approach lights and broke in two. He 
said firefighters used foam to put out the fire and used chisels to 
free some passengers from the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	Airport spokesman Phillip Launius said the plane rotated about  
150 degrees as it skidded down the runway, left the pavement and 
hit the light standard. The plane stopped with its tail facing away 
from the runway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the smoke got too thick, there was nothing we could do.  
People were screaming, `God, please save us!'' Baber said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We landed, the plane started skidding, and then flames,  
flames,'' added passenger David Stanley, who wasn't hurt. ``I 
remember flames and flames.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those taken to hospitals had injuries that included burns and  
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of them were limping and had bandages on their heads,''  
said Mark Washington, a security guard at Southwest Hospital. 
``They looked shocked and dazed ... aviation fuel, I could smell it 
on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The flight had 139 passengers and six crew members and was due  
to arrive at 9:41 p.m. It was delayed for more than two hours and 
arrived just as the storm was hitting Little Rock with lightning, 
hail and high winds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was a big crosswind,'' said Richard Klamm, 49, of  
Pine Bluff, a passenger in the first-class section. ``I think the 
pilot just lost control of the plane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines' chief pilot said he would not have attempted  
to land the plane if wind speeds exceeded 57.5 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone told me there were 50 knot gusts at the airport, I  
would be leaving town,'' Cecil Ewell said at a news conference at 
Fort Worth, Texas. Ewell oversees all of American Airlines' pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service said it warned the tower of the  
approaching storm. Bob Baker, the airline's executive vice 
president of flight operations, said that weather dispatches were 
relayed to the flight crew, but specifics of those conversations 
have not been released. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight data and cockpit voice recorders have been removed  
from the plane and were being brought to National Transportation 
Safety Board headquarters in Washington for analysis, a source 
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	William Shumann, a spokesman with the Federal Aviation  
Administration, said there was no distress call from the cockpit 
before the landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Baber, a student at Ouachita Baptist University at Arkadelphia,  
was on the plane with other members of the Ouachita Singers from a 
tour of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Baber, seated in row 30, said the flames were within 15 feet of  
him by the time he got out 30 seconds after the landing. Some 
passengers getting off the plane found themselves in waist-deep 
water. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was panic, craziness, there were flames,'' Baber said.  
``The emergency door was cracked, and people were able to get out 
only one at a time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Ashcraft was waiting at the airport for his granddaughters,  
13 and 11, to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people said they saw it come in and (airline officials)  
announced that the flight was on the ground. The plane never came 
(to the gate),'' Ashcraft said. 
</P>
<P>
	A check of the plane's maintenance records revealed no major  
problems. Twelve years ago, the plane lost power in one of its 
engines during a landing in Las Vegas because the housing around a 
part had worn away. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, President Clinton said he and Hillary Rodham  
Clinton were saddened to learn of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``We join the American people in extending our deepest  
sympathies to the families of those who died or were injured,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deaths are the first in an U.S. commercial airline accident  
since Dec. 28, 1997, when a woman was killed aboard a United 
Airlines 747 that encountered severe turbulence over the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, U.S. aviation officials celebrated a fatality-free  
year aboard scheduled U.S. commercial flights. U.S. airlines also 
had one of their safest years ever in 1997, a year after one of the 
deadliest on record.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises; Euro Hits New Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar pushed the euro to its lowest level  
ever on Wednesday, while finishing higher against most other major 
currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's advance came amid expectations that U.S. interest  
rates are headed higher, a development that makes a currency even 
more attractive to foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro sank to $1.0355 from $1.0442  
Tuesday and below its previous low of $1.0396 last Friday. It 
traded as low as $1.0340 during the trading day in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are getting rather discouraged with the euro,'' said  
Eric Nickerson, managing director for global currency strategies at 
Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest decline in the euro came even as European Central  
Bank policy-makers were meeting in Frankfurt, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, bank chief Wim Duisenberg said he remained confident  
that the euro remained sound. ``In the long run, I see more factors 
pointing at an appreciation of the euro than at a depreciation of 
the euro,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duisenberg said the euro has declined because of diverging  
economic growth rates in the United States and Europe as well as 
the Kosovo conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the outlook is for more favorable conditions for a  
recovery later this year in the 11 countries that have adopted the 
euro and stronger growth next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro has fallen about 11 percent from its Jan. 1 launch  
level. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickerson said traders are wearying of ``verbal intervention''  
and are looking for European authorities to step in financially in 
support of the euro. He said currency traders had been willing 
until last week to buy the euro on dips, but now ``are more 
inclined to sell on a rally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he said the latest U.S. economic news  
indicates the Federal Reserve ``may be closer to raising rates than 
people had thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New home sales jumped 9.2 percent in April, reaching their  
second highest level ever after four straight months of declines, 
the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Analysts said the rush 
reflects both a healthy economy and worries that mortgage rates 
will rise further. 
</P>
<P>
	Against other currencies, the dollar rose to 121.33 yen from  
120.56 yen late Tuesday and to 1.5373 Swiss francs from 1.5238, but 
fell to 1.4799 Canadian dollars from 1.4835. The British pound fell 
to $1.6041 from $1.6121. 
</P>
<P>
	The currencies of the 11 countries that have switched to the  
euro no longer are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a 
fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the euro's latest exchange rate, the dollar was worth:  
1.8889 German marks, up from 1.8730; 6.3331 French francs, up from 
6.2814; and 1,869.16 Italian lire, up from 1,855.29.

<HEADLINE>  9 Die in Ark. Plane Crash Landing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- An American Airlines flight with 145  
people aboard skidded off a runway while landing during a gusty 
hail storm, broke apart and burst into flames. Nine people were 
killed, including the pilot, and more than 80 were injured. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Kicker Murray To Retire As a Lion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Former Detroit kicker Eddie Murray will  
retire in a Lions uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions signed Murray so he could retire as a member of the  
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something that everyone within the organization feels  
good about and we're proud to have had Eddie kicking here for the 
first 11 years of his career,'' said Chuck Schmidt, the Lions' 
executive vice president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray is the Lions' career scoring leader with 1,113 points. He  
joined the team in 1980 and in 12 seasons set club career records 
for extra points (384) and field goals (244). 
</P>
<P>
	But some remember him best for missing a 43-yard field goal in  
the final seconds of a playoff game against San Francisco in 1983 
that would have sent the Lions to the NFC title game. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray was the Lions kicker from 1980-1991. He played for six  
other NFL teams from 1992-97, including the Kansas City Chiefs and 
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He played for the Dallas Cowboys in 1993 
when the Cowboys won the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent the 1997 season with Minnesota and did not play last  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Detroit has always been home for myself and my family since I  
was drafted here in 1980,'' Murray said in the team's release. 
``The Lions gave me the chance I needed to have a long, productive 
career in the NFL and I have always been grateful to them for 
that.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Florida Governor on Aid Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Florida Gov. Buddy MacKay has begun an  
eight-day mission to Central America as an envoy of President 
Clinton to discuss distribution of nearly $1 billion in disaster 
assistance to El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
	The money, approved by Congress last month as part of a $15  
billion emergency aid package, will help Central American and 
Caribbean nations recover from last fall's two deadly hurricanes, 
Mitch and Georges. 
</P>
<P>
	The disaster assistance totals $956 million. A White House  
announcement said $291 million of that amount would be designated 
for Honduras to stimulate economic recovery, assist the relocation 
of displaced Hondurans and accelerate housing reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	In Guatemala, MacKay will join the U.S. delegation attending the  
Organization of American States' General Assembly to discuss the 
administration's proposals to improve trade benefits for Central 
America under the Caribbean Basin Initiative.

<HEADLINE> Crashed Jet Is Derivative of DC-9 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The American Airlines plane that ran off a runway in Little  
Rock, Ark., was a Super MD-80, a narrow-body jet derived from a 
DC-9. 
</P>
<P>
	The MD-80, designed by McDonnell Douglas' commercial airframe  
division in Long Beach, Calif., is a twin-jet version of the more 
widely known DC-9, with a single aisle and an engine on each side 
of the tail. 
</P>
<P>
	The MD-80 went into service in 1980 and has had at least five  
variations -- including the Super -- that offer different ranges, 
seating capacities and cockpit electronics. The jetliners sold for 
$26 million in 1984 and have been flown by many airlines on 
short-to-medium trips. 
</P>
<P>
	The MD-80 series was almost solely responsible for returning the  
St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas to profitability in 1985 after 
more than a decade of red ink. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the Boeing Co. announced it would phase out the MD-80  
and MD-90 models it inherited when it bought McDonnell Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's Web site says that 1,167 copies of various MD-80  
versions have been delivered. American Airlines operates the 
largest number of MD-80s, a fleet of 260. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 16, 1987, a Northwest Airlines MD-80 crashed on takeoff  
at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, killing 156 people.

<HEADLINE> NASA Measure of Universe Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A new radio-telescope technique has established a  
``golden ruler'' for measuring cosmic distances and raises doubts 
about the claim last week that NASA astronomers had determined the 
age and expansion rate of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Herrnstein of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory said  
his method produces ``the most precise distance ever measured to a 
remote galaxy'' and suggests a 15 percent to 20 percent margin of 
error in the technique used by the astronomers sponsored by the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ours is a direct measurement, using geometry, and is  
independent of all other methods of determining cosmic distances,'' 
Herrnstein said Tuesday at a national meeting of the American 
Astronomical Society. 
</P>
<P>
	The NASA team led by Wendy Freedman of the Carnegie Institute in  
Washington said last week that they used the Hubble Space Telescope 
to successfully achieve the goal of measuring within an uncertainty 
of only 10 percent the speed at which the universe is expanding, a 
value called the Hubble constant. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on its study, the team concluded that the universe is 12  
billion to 13 billion years old and is expanding at an accelerating 
rate of 70 kilometers per second for every 3.3 million light-years 
in distance from the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Herrnstein said this calculation was off by as much as 20  
percent. He based his conclusion on the difference in calculated 
distance to a specific galaxy when comparing his technique with the 
method used by the NASA group. 
</P>
<P>
	Freedman and her team of 27 astronomers spent eight years  
measuring the distance to stars that pulsate in brightness at a 
known rate. Such stars, called cepheids, are considered ``standard 
candles'' whose varying luminosity gives a gauge for their 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
	But Herrnstein said the technique using cepheids is far less  
accurate than his new method that directly measures the motion of 
gas around a galaxy. 
</P>
<P>
	Herrnstein used a galaxy called NGC 4258 to establish what he  
called a ``golden ruler'' for measuring cosmic distances. 
</P>
<P>
	NGC 4258 is surrounded by a rotating cloud of gas. Within this  
gas cloud is water vapor, which tends to amplify radio signals. 
This creates radio ``hot spots'' called masers. 
</P>
<P>
	The orbital speed of masers between NGC 4258 and Earth was  
measured in 1994, and again every few months over the following 
three years. By determining the speed at which the masers were 
moving, the astronomers created a triangle with the first maser 
position at one angle, the latest position at a second angle and 
the galaxy center at the third angle. Measuring the angles gives 
the distance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can use plain old trigonometry to calculate the distance,''  
said Lincoln Greenhill, a member of the Herrnstein team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very simple and direct,'' said Herrnstein. ``Most of us  
know enough math from high school to do the calculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The distance to NGC 4258 was calculated at 23.5 million  
light-years, with an accuracy to within 4 percent. This distance 
has been calculated using the cepheid star technique at 27 million 
to 29 million light-years. 
</P>
<P>
	Herrnstein said the distance measure using cepheid stars is  
based on a series of assumed values, such as the distance to the 
Large Magellanic Cloud, a galaxy neighbor to the Milky Way. These 
assumed values, said Herrnstein, have a greater margin of error 
than does the direct measuring technique he is using. 
</P>
<P>
	Freedman, who attended a news conference at which Herrnstein  
announced his results, said the new study provided ``wonderful 
data,'' but she would like other measurements to be taken to 
confirm its accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, she said the assumed values used in the cepheid star  
technique have been verified by a number of researchers and she was 
``confident'' of the results. Freedman admitted, however, that 
uncertainties in her team's results still needed to be checked out. 
</P>
<P>
	Herrnstein conducted his study using the Very Long Baseline  
Array, which is a series of radio-telescope antennae that are 
scattered across the United States, from the Virgin Islands to 
Hawaii. The antennae operate as a single unit and are able to 
measure natural radio signals to an accuracy 500 times greater than 
the Hubble telescope can measure visible light.

<HEADLINE> Pak Has Struggled Since Open Title  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST POINT, Miss. (AP) -- Standing in water up to her calves,  
staring at a ball buried in the grassy bank of a creek on the 18th 
hole of a playoff, Se Ri Pak figured winning the U.S. Women's Open 
would be the toughest task she ever faced. 
</P>
<P>
	The real challenge is dealing with expectations that have  
swelled since that remarkable Monday at Blackwolf Run, when the 
20-year-old South Korean became the youngest champion in the 
longest Women's Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Having not won in the past 10 months, Pak arrived at Old Waverly  
Golf Club for the 54th Women's Open trying to defend more than her 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try my best, but every week I cannot get No. 1 in the  
trophy,'' she said, still struggling to learn English. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korean press wonders if her new boyfriend is the reason her  
best finish this year has been a tie for 18th. Some question her 
decision to split with swing coach David Leadbetter at the end of 
her sensational rookie season, when she won two majors. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, her countrymen didn't know the difference between a  
birdie or a bogey. Now, they expect her to win every time she 
sticks a tee in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I not play good,'' Pak said. ``They don't understand  
how tough all players, golf course condition, anything. Sometimes 
they are pretty upset, not playing good. That makes pretty hard 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conditions at Old Waverly are not nearly as brutal as they  
were a year ago at Blackwolf Run, when Pak and Jenny Chuasiriporn 
tied at 6-over 290 before their 20-hole playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	With showers Wednesday making the course even softer, rough that  
is little more than a nuisance and not much wind in the forecast, 
the record score of 10-under set two years ago by Alison Nicholas 
could be in danger. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the strength of the field?  
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps Pak should send home a postcard of Karrie Webb, a  
four-time winner this year who has now finished lower than 10th in 
her last 14 tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	Annika Sorenstam, who beat out Pak for player of the year in  
1998, is poised to make her first victory of the year a third 
Women's Open title. Juli Inkster and Meg Mallon have each won twice 
this year, and Dottie Pepper is riding a wave of confidence from 
her win in the first major, a record 19-under in the Dinah Shore. 
</P>
<P>
	All of them feel the pressure that comes with trying to win the  
most prestigious event in women's golf. 
</P>
<P>
	None of them carry the same burden as Pak.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know for Se Ri, there has been a lot of pressure for her to  
perform -- not really so much from herself, but her fellow country 
people,'' Nancy Lopez said. ``I think they expected a lot from 
here. And because it matters to her, it's probably put more 
pressure on her. 
</P>
<P>
	``She needs to have breathing room because she's not going to be  
perfect all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pak wasn't perfect last year, although it seemed like that  
during a torrid stretch of golf. 
</P>
<P>
	The centerpiece was the Women's Open, a championship that Pak  
nearly didn't win -- and probably should not have won. 
</P>
<P>
	On the 18th hole of the playoff, her drive was headed for the  
creek when it dipped down the bank and was caught up in the rough. 
Her chances slipping away, Pak stepped into the water, pulled out a 
wedge, closed her eyes and listened for the gallery to tell her the 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are screaming good news,'' she recalls. ``So, I am very  
happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She managed a bogey to force a sudden-death finish, and Pak  
burst into tears when she made a birdie putt two holes later. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very difficult to get,'' she said. ``Worked pretty hard. So, I  
got the trophy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Already having won the LPGA Championship, she became the first  
player since Inkster in 1984 to win two majors as a rookie. Pak set 
two scoring records in her third victory, then won for the fourth 
time in nine starts in the Giant Eagle Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakmania was born.  
</P>
<P>
	``Pure bedlam,'' said Laura Davies, who had to play with Pak and  
battle a Korean press corps that charted her every shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Pak was paired with Webb and Sorenstam during the first two  
rounds of the du Maurier Classic. A mass of photographers nearly 
stepped on Webb's ball in the rough during one scramble to get into 
position, and took pictures of Pak standing on the green as 
Sorenstam was in the middle of her putting stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	After the round, Pak required six officials just to get to the  
locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people, many attention, especially media,'' Pak said.  
``Sometimes it is pretty hard to handle it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She is a year older now, and the smile still comes easily. With  
advice from Lopez, Pak is learning to say no, trying to get a 
handle on the attention and the expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people ask me what happen because they think about last  
year,'' Pak said. ``I played good season. Right now, kind of quiet. 
Actually feel like more better than last year. Everything right now 
all set, ready to go.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Illinois Player Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	URBANA, Ill. (AP) -- Former Illinois basketball player Ervin  
Small pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	After the plea Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Michael McCuskey  
granted a request by assistant U.S. attorney Kevin Byrnes that 
Small, 31, be held pending sentencing Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``While he has been thoroughly cooperative and candid, and  
provided sworn statements as to his guilt ... it doesn't rebut the 
fact that he's committed a dangerous crime,'' Byrnes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal sentencing guidelines call for Small, of Champaign, to  
face a mandatory prison sentence of 10 years to life, but he could 
possibly get a lesser sentence for cooperating with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Small played at Illinois from 1988 through 1990 and was a member  
of the team that went to the NCAA tournament's Final Four in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	He had worked for almost six years as a correctional officer at  
the Danville Correctional Center before resigning in February. 
Police said there was no indication that Small had tried to 
distribute cocaine at the medium-security prison.

<HEADLINE> Stock Prices Decline in Japan / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar moved higher against the yen Thursday  
morning amid expectations that U.S. interest rates will rise. Tokyo 
share prices slipped. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.71 yen in late morning, up 1.17 yen from  
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
121.33 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 177.32 points,  
or 1.08 percent, to 16,240.67 points at the end of the morning 
session. The index had gained 9.49 points, or 0.06 percent, on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar gained ground on buying by  
Japanese institutional investors, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback's advance was partly based on a belief among  
investors that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates 
to cool the economy, traders said. Higher interest rates make a 
currency more attractive to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting the dollar was the currency's strength against  
the euro, which was partly a result of ongoing warfare in Kosovo, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at 126.14 yen, up from 124.78 yen late  
Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices dropped as investors took to the  
sidelines amid a lack of major market-moving news. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazunori Jinnai, deputy general manager of the equity department  
at Daiwa Securities SB Capital markets, said the market will likely 
remain near current levels until Friday, when key U.S. jobs data 
will be released in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the upcoming employment data would provide clues on  
the future direction of U.S. interest rates and stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 10.39 points, or 0.78 percent, to 1,316.38. 
The TOPIX finished up 9.29 points, or 0.71 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 18.37 points  
to close at 10,577.89. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.6750 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.6700 percent, 
driving its price down to 97.64 yen from 97.68 yen.

<HEADLINE> Feds Accuse Petco of Unequal Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal civil rights agency accused the  
nation's second-largest pet food retailer on Wednesday of paying 
women less than men to manage stores in Alameda and Contra Costa 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
	The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued Petco Animal  
Supplies for sex discrimination against five women. The commission 
said it was also seeking damages for any other Petco employees who 
had suffered similar discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	One woman, Sherri Savage, was named manager of the company's  
store in Walnut Creek in September 1995 and paid $22,000 a year, 
$10,000 less than her male predecessor, the EEOC said. She became 
manager of the Martinez store the following August for $26,500, 
which was $9,500 less than the previous male manager made, the 
commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another woman, Katherine Bloom, was assigned to manage a new  
store in the Alameda County community of Dublin in August 1995 
after over two years as a company manager. The district manager 
told her there was no money in the budget to raise her $27,300 
salary, the EEOC said. 
</P>
<P>
	She was transferred to another store seven months later, and  
replaced by a man who had no pet store experience and was paid 
$36,000, the EEOC said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This lawsuit serves to ensure equality in the law and to  
address what appears to be a systemic problem within the company,'' 
the EEOC's regional attorney, William Tamayo, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Petco, based in San Diego, said it had no pattern of sex  
discrimination in managers' pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``Managers' salaries are based on breadth and scope of  
management experience and other business considerations,'' Janet 
Mitchell, senior vice president of human resources and 
administration, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company has a strong commitment to equal employment  
opportunity and does not discriminate against employees on any 
basis, including sex.''

<HEADLINE> Spurs' Elliott Basks in Celebrity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- It's already known in San Antonio as ``The  
Shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Elliott's off-balance, on his tip-toes, almost  
out-of-bounds 3-pointer that beat Portland in Game 2 of the Western 
Conference finals is almost certainly the biggest basket in the 
franchise's history and ranks with some of the toughest 
game-winning shots in NBA playoff history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just grateful that the ball went in,'' Elliott said when  
he showed up for the Spurs' optional workout on Tuesday in San 
Antonio. ``If people want to remember me for that, so be it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said maybe the Spurs' devoutly Christian players -- David  
Robinson and Avery Johnson -- deserve credit for the two close 
homecourt victories that put the Spurs up 2-0 in the best-of-seven 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have to thank somebody,'' Elliott said. ``We have  
to thank David and Avery for praying so much. Somebody answered our 
prayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott said he's watched the replay of his game winner ``a  
couple of dozen times.'' Meanwhile, the phone at his house has been 
ringing constantly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a million calls,'' he said. ``I've got everybody calling  
me. I had a couple of old coaches calling me, practically 
everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said by making six of seven 3-pointers in Game 2,  
Elliott could change the Blazers' defensive strategy, which mostly 
has been to collapse on Tim Duncan and David Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're going to pay a little more attention to  
Sean,'' Johnson said. ``Maybe that may free up some more 
penetration from our perimeter guys, especially Mario and myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs planned to practice in San Antonio today before  
traveling to Portland, where the series doesn't resume until 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers, who took Tuesday off, can use every minute of the  
long layoff to repair their psyche. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is the toughest loss that we've had all season,''  
Damon Stoudamire said. ``But the good thing about this is ... we've 
got three days to regroup, and then they're going to come into a 
hostile environment in Portland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers led by as many as 18 points and didn't trail in the  
game until Elliott's game-winner with nine seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took incredible shots to beat us,'' Portland coach Mike  
Dunleavy said. ``I'd give (Elliott) 100 bucks to see him make that 
shot again. It was one of those shots you dream about making ... I 
told the guys they have nothing to hang their heads about. It's 
getting harder and harder for this team to beat us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said the momentum of the  
miracle comeback probably won't last until the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we were coming back and playing tomorrow, it would be  
huge,'' he said. ``But Friday is like 2 1/2 weeks from now. Nobody 
will even be able to remember this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs' eight-game playoff winning streak will be tested in  
the noisy Rose Garden, where the Blazers lost just three times 
during the regular season and are 5-0 in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Portland must win four out of five, including at least  
once in the Alamodome, to advance to the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see why we can't,'' Greg Anthony said. ``We're a real  
confident basketball team. We're a real talented basketball team.''

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Protest Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- Turning up the pressure on Israel's  
prime minister-elect, Palestinian leaders said Wednesday they will 
not resume peace talks unless Ehud Barak freezes Jewish settlement 
expansion in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning by Palestinian Parliament Speaker Ahmed Qureia came  
on the eve of what the Palestinians have designated as a ``day of 
rage'' -- a series of protest marches Thursday in the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the burst of settlement expansion under outgoing  
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Qureia said: ``Reason dictates 
that there cannot be a resumption of negotiations without a clear 
message on cessation of settlement activity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barak has promised to revitalize the negotiations, but has also  
assured potential hawkish coalition partners he will not cut 
funding to settlements and will complete some of the construction 
authorized by Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak spokesman David Ziso said the prime minister-elect regards  
negotiations with the Palestinians as ``very important'' and plans 
to meet with President Clinton and Mideast leaders soon to move the 
talks forward. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians have expressed concern that Barak will press  
ahead in negotiations with Syria and Lebanon and leave the 
Palestinian issue to last -- robbing the Palestinians of leverage in 
light of Syria's refusal to coordinate positions ahead of a 
resumption of peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo said  
Thursday's marches were intended to send a message ``that the 
situation is on the brink of an irreversible explosion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abed Rabbo said he expected the protests to be peaceful, unless  
the marchers are provoked by Israeli troops. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction called  
for confrontation with Israel. The protests will ``ignite the land 
under (the settlers') feet until they leave our land forever,'' 
said a Fatah statement distributed in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	The militant Islamic group Hamas said in a statement it would  
also participate in Thursday's protests. ``We reiterate that 
confrontation is the best way to obtain our rights,'' Hamas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Potential flashpoints are the Palestinian towns of Hebron,  
Bethlehem and Nablus, where Israel retains a military presence. 
</P>
<P>
	A scuffle broke out Wednesday in Hebron between Palestinians and  
Jewish settlers after the settlers attacked Palestinian Boy Scouts 
near a holy site there. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israeli army broke up the fight and briefly detained two  
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians have been especially angered by a burst of  
settlement activity in the final days of the Netanyahu government. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, outgoing Defense Minister Moshe Arens expanded the  
West Bank settlement of Maale Adumim by four square miles, 
connecting it to Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	With the expansion, Maale Adumim will further cut off east  
Jerusalem from its West Bank hinterland and make it more difficult 
for Israel and the Palestinians to reach a creative solution on the 
future of Jerusalem, the most explosive issue in their conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak has not commented on the move and has been vague in  
general about his intentions regarding settlements.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Leads Corn, Soybeans Up / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures advanced Wednesday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade, leading corn and soybeans higher, amid concern 
about planting delays in the northern Plains. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat reversed early losses tied to pressure from harvesting of  
the winter wheat crop as rain continued to delay planting of spring 
wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Agriculture Department reported late Tuesday that 85  
percent of the nation's spring wheat had been sown, but the window 
is rapidly closing for getting the remainder of the crop into the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	While spring wheat production is much smaller than winter wheat,  
the government reported earlier this year that plantings would be 
down sharply as farmers eye a weak world demand situation. Further 
delays could reduce production even more. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn gained on the strength in wheat despite the government's  
report that most of the crop is in the ground and in good 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans edged higher on the strength of the grains complex.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 1 1/2 cents to $2.53 1/4 a bushel; July  
corn rose 1/2 cent to $2.16 3/4 a bushel; July oats rose 3/4 cent to 
$1.22 1/2 a bushel; July soybeans rose 3/4 cent to $4.58 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle and pork futures were mixed on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while feeder cattle retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose .02 cent to 64.52 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .20 cent to 75.67 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
fell .82 cent to 50.65 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose .85 
cent to 53.55 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Estimates 200M New Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In its first detailed look at the impact of  
the Asian financial crisis on global poverty, the World Bank 
estimates the world has 200 million ``newly poor'' and recommends 
urgent changes in financial rescue programs to protect people, not 
just economies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Countries that until recently believed they were turning the  
tide in the fight against poverty are witnessing its 
re-emergence,'' said bank President James D. Wolfensohn. ``We must 
now draw on the lessons of recent experience to help us reshape our 
strategies for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Programs to avoid and deal with financial crises in all  
countries should boost social protections, referred to by 
economists as ``safety nets,'' the bank said in its annual update 
on global poverty. They include unemployment insurance, subsidized 
school fees, job creation, food subsidies and other programs aimed 
at keeping more people from slipping into poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank is responding to data showing poverty rising again in  
India, continuing to go up in Africa and sharply worsening across 
Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Indonesia, hit early in the 
crisis, is among the worst hit, with 30 million more people earning 
less than $1 a day than it had before the financial collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide, the number of people below that income, considered  
the benchmark for abject poverty, is estimated at 1.5 billion -- up 
200 million from 1993. Final figures for 1999 will not be available 
for several years, but the estimate is based on trends since 1.2 
billion poor were counted in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the gloomy outlook for global poverty, the report said  
there has been widespread progress in health and education. And an 
exception to the increase in poverty is China, where the number of 
poor is believed to have declined from 280 million in 1990 to 125 
million in 1997.

	The bank, in a report last week based on a survey of Asian  
companies, concluded that Asian economies are recovering more 
quickly than expected from the crises, which started in Thailand in 
1997 with plunging currency rates and spread through Asia and 
beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	The new report points to the lasting impact of the crisis on  
some of the world's poorest, diminishing hope of cutting worldwide 
poverty in half by 2020 -- a goal many experts had thought could be 
achieved. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's underlying purpose always has been to cut poverty,  
but it has been criticized in recent years for lending programs 
that stress long-term development over dealing more directly with 
the suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	``The East Asia crisis and its spillover into other emerging  
markets offers the world an opportunity to devise a new approach to 
crisis, one that rightly puts concern for the poor and the 
vulnerable right at the center of its response,'' said World Bank 
economist Giovanna Prennushi, who authored the global report.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Looking more like a candidate than ever, Hillary  
Rodham Clinton worked the crowd at the City College commencement 
Wednesday and cautioned graduates against those who try to ``lift 
up our public schools and the students they serve by tearing them 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, who is edging closer to a Senate race, did not  
name names, but a potential Republican rival, New York Mayor 
Rudolph Giuliani has frequently criticized the city's public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	As she walked through the crowd of 3,000 graduates, Mrs. Clinton  
shook dozens and dozens of hands thrust out by cheering students, 
warming to the task as she went along. One man put his arms out for 
a hug, and she returned his embrace after a moment's hesitation. 
Later, students chanted, ``Run, Hillary, run!'' 
</P>
<P>
	As she has before, the first lady called for more resources for  
public schools, improved early childhood education and higher 
educational standards. Her every sentence was met with a roar from 
the students, most of them black, Hispanic and from working-class 
backgrounds. And like a candidate on the campaign trail, Mrs. 
Clinton's cadences grew stronger with every cheer. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, at a state Democratic Committee luncheon, Mrs. Clinton  
was asked if she had any news to report about a bid for the Senate 
seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will have something to say later,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Her spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, said Mrs. Clinton was not about  
to reveal her plans. ``She's still weighing the options,'' said Ms. 
Berry. 
</P>
<P>
	But close associates say they expect Mrs. Clinton to run,  
barring a sudden change of heart. They say that before making an 
announcement, she would notify New York Rep. Nita Lowey, a Democrat 
who was considering the race herself, of her plans. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the congresswoman said the two women had not  
talked as of Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. George Pataki criticized Mrs. Clinton as a carpetbagger  
because she has never lived in New York. ``I don't think we need 
somebody from Washington or Arkansas moving to New York to 
represent us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But in remarks prepared for delivery at an evening event, Rep.  
Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said, ``We New Yorkers don't care about 
where you're from. We New Yorkers care about what you can do to 
continue to build the greatest city, state and country in the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in a purple graduation gown, Mrs. Clinton received the  
City College President's Medal honoring her work on behalf of 
women's rights, children's issues and education. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can never lift up our public schools and the students they  
serve by tearing them down,'' she told the graduates at the 
school's Harlem campus. ``We can never ensure the future of this 
city or state or our nation by undermining the public education 
system that is at the very foundation of the American dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said education reform would work only ``if we stop  
pointing fingers.'' She cautioned against those who said they want 
to improve education ``to score political points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not all students agreed with her every point of view. When Mrs.  
Clinton described visiting ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo in 
Macedonia, a dozen graduates held up a large banner reading ``Stop 
war now!'' But their chants were not loud enough to disrupt her. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Democratic luncheon, Mrs. Clinton was given a Yankees  
baseball cap by United Federation of Teachers President Randi 
Weingarten, who was being honored by the state party. Afterward, 
the first lady shook hands with restaurant patrons and waved to a 
small cheering crowd of joggers and mothers with strollers waiting 
near her limousine. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton made no mention of a possible run for the Senate.  
Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said, ``There's no candidacy yet. But 
Hillary Clinton gets closer and closer and closer and we get more 
and more excited about the prospect.''

<HEADLINE> Profile of Charlotte Church </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- She has been called a child prodigy and an opera  
phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte Church, a 13-year-old Welsh soprano, is taking the  
music world by storm. Her international tour began as her album was 
being released in the United States, taking her all over Europe, 
Asia and America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Voice of an Angel'' went double platinum in the United Kingdom  
last year, where it sold two million copies after just four weeks. 
It reached the No. 4 spot on the British pop chart, and rose to the 
No. 1 classical spot. 
</P>
<P>
	The album entered the U.S. charts at No. 28 when it was released  
by Sony Classical in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Her cornflower blue eyes sparkle when she considers her recent  
engagement schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	She performed for Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles at the  
opening of the Welsh Assembly; at Prince Charles' 50th birthday 
celebration in London; and at Pope John Paul II's Christmas in the 
Vatican concert. She has an invitation to perform at the White 
House on June 13. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not to say she hasn't been sobered by stardom. ``I  
thought it was going to be all glamorous and really easy, and it's 
not as glamorous as you think, and it's really, really hard,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her signature piece is Andrew Lloyd Webber's ``Pie Jesu,'' a  
haunting work that showcases her confident high notes and lyrical 
phrasing. 
</P>
<P>
	``She sang 'Pie Jesu' for me and I was blown away,'' said  
Jonathan Shalit, her manager. ``Then I took her to meet the Sony 
execs and she sang it, they were blown away. People quickly started 
to recognize her for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schoolwork comes before interviews, and detention is an option --  
even on the road. So far, it hasn't been a problem. Charlotte 
studies, performs -- and laughs a lot. Her sometimes grueling 
schedule has yet to get her down. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are days where it's not hard at all and some days it can  
be manic,'' she said. ``It just depends on which day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the travel, the concerts and the schoolwork don't upset her,  
interviews can. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate radio interviews,'' Charlotte said. Shalit smiles, then  
ducks into a nearby room. He knows what's coming. ``They all ask me 
the same thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte crosses her arms, rolls her eyes and gazes up at the  
ceiling with an exasperated look. Then she launches into a typical 
Q&AMP;A with herself. 
</P>
<P>
	``So, Charlotte, how were you discovered?  
</P>
<P>
	``I was discovered when I introduced my Auntie Caroline on  
television and I started to sing. 
</P>
<P>
	``What kind of music do you like?  
</P>
<P>
	``I like Will Smith, Puff Daddy, George Michael and Celine Dion.  
</P>
<P>
	``What do your friends back home think of your success?  
</P>
<P>
	``Well, they just think it's wonderful.  
</P>
<P>
	``Do you think you have the voice of an angel?''  
</P>
<P>
	At this point, her legs are crossed, her foot is bouncing, and  
she's giving the interviewer her best ``How should I know?'' look. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I say 'no,' they think I'm being overly modest. If I say  
'yes,' they think I'm bigheaded,'' she explained with a big sigh. 
</P>
<P>
	She enjoyed Las Vegas, where she made her U.S. debut at the  
annual convention of the National Association of Recording 
Merchandisers in March. ``It was amazing. It was really, really 
fun. We went to see some of the shows, we saw all the lights and 
everything. Of course, I couldn't gamble. I'm underage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the attention hasn't curbed her teen-age tendencies.  
</P>
<P>
	She likes to shop, but isn't a fan of Japanese couture. ``I  
couldn't believe the clothes there,'' she said in her distinctive 
Welsh accent, as she described bell bottoms bigger than both her 
legs and platform shoes with 8-inch heels. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, she asked her mother if she could buy the shoes.  
</P>
<P>
	The answer was ``'No! They're too high,''' recalled Charlotte,  
falling into the couch in a peal of laughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``People love the fact she's so normal,'' Shalit said.  
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte travels with her mother, Shalit, a singing coach and a  
tutor. Her father stays behind in Wales, where he works as a 
security supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love to sing with Renee Fleming, Placido Domingo, Andrea  
Bocelli, TLC and Puff Daddy,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	If they ever work together, Puffy -- whose real name is Sean  
Combs -- won't have to worry about her behaving like an opera diva. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's different for a child,'' she said. ``I don't go  
about thinking 'I'm a diva.' My mother would kill me, my family 
would kill me. I don't think I'm like that, anyway.''

<HEADLINE> US To Skip Step in Nuclear Disposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After 16 years of experiments, the Energy  
Department has abandoned a key step in its process to vitrify and 
store millions of gallons of highly radioactive nuclear waste at a 
nuclear weapons facility in South Carolina, department officials 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson decided last week to seek a new  
private contractor to examine alternatives to the failed process 
that had been abandoned because it was found to produce explosive 
gases, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The process involves attempts to separate the most highly  
radioactive material from the less radioactive liquid, so that less 
of the material actually would have to be turned into glass logs 
for disposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The vitrification program calls for converting the waste into  
6,000 glass logs, a process that is expected to cost more than $17 
billion and take nearly 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department has built a $2 billion high-tech glass  
factory at the Savannah River weapons complex in South Carolina to 
transform the liquid waste into molten glass logs that can be more 
easily stored. The waste, left over from nuclear weapons 
production, will remain radioactive for thousands of years. 
</P>
<P>
	A study released today by the General Accounting Office, the  
investigative arm of Congress, said the search for a substitute 
method for separating the liquid could take eight to 10 years and 
cost from $1 billion to as much as $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The government since 1983 has spent about $490 million in trying  
to perfect the ``in-tank precipitation'' method of separation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., who ordered the GAO investigation,  
said the Energy Department should have abandoned the flawed 
separation method much earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mismanagement (of the program) ... led to an extraordinary and  
pathetic waste of taxpayer money,'' Dingell said in a statement. 
``All we have to show for $500 million is a 20-year delay and the 
opportunity to risk another $1 billion to make a problematic 
process work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Department spokeswoman Anne Elliott said it was decided  
early last year not to proceed with the full-scale in-tank 
precipitation. She said three options will now be considered for 
waste separation including a scaled-back version of in-tank 
precipitation. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the contractor for the separation project, Westinghouse  
Government Services, was being replaced and a decision on how to 
proceed is expected later this year. Despite the problems with the 
separation process, the 2028 target for removal of the 35 million 
gallons of waste has not changed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	If a way can be developed to separate the liquid, the waste  
would be encased in 6,000 glass logs that will be put in drum-like 
canisters for long-term storage or burial.

	Stocks End Mixed; Dow Down 18.37  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices closed mixed today as investors  
prepared themselves for a possible increase in interest rates but 
nonetheless went in search of bargains in the battered technology 
sector. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 18.37 to close at 
10,577.89. Broader stock indicators were slightly higher after 
paring big losses. The technology-dominated Nasdaq rose 20.36 to 
2,432.39. An afternoon speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan helped calm a jittery market. The influential 
policy-maker kept his remarks at an international business 
conference in Boston tightly focused on trade, and did not address 
interest rates.

	Greenspan Warns Vs. Protectionism  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said  
that the U.S. economy has reaped enormous benefits from lowering 
trade barriers and warned against any switch to protectionism. In a 
Boston speech to an international business conference, Greenspan 
expressed concern at what he sees as a weakening of support for 
free trade in the United States. ``Protecting markets from new 
technologies has never succeeded,'' Greenspan said. He stuck to 
trade matters, and did not discuss interest rates, in his speech.

	Sales of New Homes Up 9.2 Percent

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New home sales reached their second highest  
level on record in April as buyers, trying to stay ahead of rising 
mortgage rates, rushed to close deals. Sales of new single-family 
homes jumped 9.2 percent in April, following four straight months 
of declines, the Commerce Department said today. The surge pushed 
up sales of new homes to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
978,000 units in April. The all-time high was a sales rate of 
985,000 units set last November.

	Philly Exchange Urges Trading Delay  
</P>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Stock Exchange's chairman  
today urged Security and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt 
to delay plans for extended stock trading hours that would put 
massive demands on exchanges. The National Association of 
Securities Dealers, which governs Nasdaq, approved a plan last week 
to extend trading hours from the current 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
Eastern time schedule, with a second session that would likely 
start at 5:30 p.m. and end at 9 p.m. or later. The board of the New 
York Stock Exchange is expected to consider a proposal tomorrow to 
extend trading hours starting in July as the traditional markets 
try to respond to rising competition from overseas exchanges and 
alternative computer-based exchanges.

	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- The Teamsters union and companies that  
haul new cars to dealerships nationwide today announced tentative 
agreement on a four-year contract, averting a strike. Under the 
terms, drivers who choose to retire after 25 years of work would 
get better pension benefits, including health insurance for those 
age 55 and older, union officials said. Although the union did not 
agree to allow part-time drivers, Teamsters Union president James 
Hoffa said negotiators made a concession to scheduling adaptability 
that the companies had sought.

the $600 million deal that would have united the world's largest 
bookstore chain and the No. 1 book wholesaler. Today's decision, 
which was mutually agreed to by both companies, follows recent 
reports that the Federal Trade Commission might delay or block the 
deal. Independent booksellers cheered the news. Barnes &AMP; Noble 
stock closed up 1 1/4 at 28 5/8.

	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Some 250 employees will lose their jobs  
at Adobe Systems this year in a restructuring plan designed to 
increase revenue. That number represents 9 percent of Adobe 
employees worldwide. The desktop publishing software company said 
today that 40 percent of the job cuts will come from overseas 
operations, mainly in Edinburgh, Scotland. The savings will be used 
to increase investments in e-business and enhanced marketing 
programs. Adobe posted 1998 earnings of $105 million on revenue of 
$895 million.

however, they're trying to make a name for themselves at the annual 
Computex trade show in Taipei, one of the top three computer shows 
in the world. With output forecast to rise nearly 15 percent to 
more than $45 billion this year, Taiwan is entrenched as the

	Gates, Lawyers Tell Different Tales

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the government's antitrust case against  
Microsoft winds toward an end in federal court, it seems at times 
that company chairman Bill Gates and lawyers representing the 
software giant are reading from different scripts. This week, for 
the second time during the high-stakes trial, comments made by 
Gates have undercut the company's legal arguments. In the latest 
instance, while Microsoft argued in court that new devices might 
cut deeply into its business, Gates wrote in Newsweek that personal 
computers -- which depend almost exclusively on the company's 
Windows operating system -- would remain the industry standard for 
years.

model. List prices will range from $19,995 for the base DX model to 
$25,550 for the luxury ES model. Those prices make the imported MPV 
competitive with minivans offered by domestic and foreign

	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- US Airways plans to give pay raises of  
nearly 14 percent to 9,500 passenger-service workers who have gone 
seven years without a pay increase. US Airways said the raises are 
not only deserved but necessary and long overdue. The airline's 
action came four days after a federal Appeals Court overturned the 
1997 election giving the Communications Workers of America the 
right to represent the workers, but a CWA spokeswoman said the 
union negotiated most of the improvements.

<HEADLINE> Financial Issues in Elderly Divorce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Divorce, fortunately, is not common among older  
people, particularly those who have been married many years. 
</P>
<P>
	Marriages still are more apt to break up around the seven-year  
mark, not on a silver anniversary. But when divorce occurs later in 
life, it not only can be emotionally devastating, it can present 
far more complicated financial issues compared with early breakups, 
says an estate planning expert at the College for Financial 
Planning. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the first things to do is to review your financial and  
estate planning documents,'' suggests Gregg Parish, an academic 
associate at the college. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a spouse will likely be named as beneficiary in a  
will, a joint tenant in bank and brokerage accounts, as the agent 
in financial and health care powers of attorney, and as trustee of 
a trust. 
</P>
<P>
	Parish notes that while state divorce laws typically make some  
of these designations null and void upon divorce, ``that doesn't 
take care of the time during which you are getting divorced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If during the divorce process you die or become incapacitated --  
always a greater risk the older you are -- the surviving spouse will 
retain complete control. ``You probably will want to remove them 
from these positions as soon as possible,'' Parish says. 
</P>
<P>
	A common situation, he says, is when a couple owns a home in  
joint tenancy with rights of survival. Thus, if one spouse dies, 
the other automatically inherits the home. 
</P>
<P>
	Parish says many divorce experts recommend that couples sever  
the joint tenancy, often by converting ownership to tenants in 
common, in which each party is considered to own half of the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
	Parish says this typically can be done simply by executing and  
recording a deed, but state laws vary, so it's important to check 
as soon as possible with an attorney to see what should be done. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of bank accounts, money markets and some other cash  
equivalents held in joint tenancy, it's probably best if the couple 
divides up the accounts and deposits their half in separate 
accounts, says Parish. 
</P>
<P>
	You also may be able to transfer half of your jointly held  
brokerage accounts and mutual funds into separate accounts, though 
that will depend in part on how the account is titled and what 
restrictions the brokerage house or mutual fund may have on 
transfers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it's usually best not to sell assets at this stage in  
order to divide the proceeds because the sale will likely trigger 
capital-gains taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Parish cautions that moving a portion of a bank or brokerage  
account into solely your name ``doesn't mean you've converted it 
from marital property to separate property that you won't have to 
account for in the divorce proceedings.'' It merely prevents one 
spouse from arbitrarily spending more than his or her half of 
jointly held property. 
</P>
<P>
	Another area older people going through divorce should be  
especially cautious about is inheritances or gifts from their own 
parents. You may want to stop or delay distribution of their estate 
to you, says Parish, to reduce the chance that the property would 
become mixed into marital property. Or you might put any gifts or 
inheritances into a separate account or trust. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the problems here,'' says Parish, ``is that like so  
many of divorce and estate planning laws, it is state law that 
determines what is and is not marital property. The area can be 
murky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Older divorcing spouses also are more likely than younger  
couples to own interests in a small business, such as a partnership 
or corporation. Typically the partners or owners have an agreement 
stating what rights they have should one of the parties go through 
a divorce. So an early step would be to review the agreement with 
the other owners in order to take proper action. 
</P>
<P>
	The presence of minor children is typically less of an issue for  
older divorcing couples, but not unheard of for someone still in 
their late 50s or even early 60s. 
</P>
<P>
	If children are still around, it becomes particularly important  
that the person providing child support payments take precautions 
to ensure that payments continue in the event of his or her death, 
disability or unemployment. Life insurance or other assets could be 
put into an irrevocable trust from which support payments can be 
made in these circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	Alimony payments are far less common today because women are  
more likely to be self-supporting than they once were. But among 
today's older couples it's still not uncommon to find a woman who 
may not have employable skills, and who must rely on her former 
spouse for support. 
</P>
<P>
	As in the case of child support payments, steps should be taken  
to ensure continuation of payments if the obligated party dies 
before the recipient. 
</P>
<P>
	Division of property, such as the home, retirement benefits and  
investment accounts, is crucial ``because a lot more in the way of 
assets are typically at stake among older divorcing couples than 
younger ones,'' Parish says. 
</P>
<P>
	The same caution can be said about older people who remarry.  
Because they may have accumulated a lifetime of assets, prenuptial 
agreements often should play a role in order to protect assets for 
themselves or their heirs.

<HEADLINE>  Devil Rays Pick Hamilton No. 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Tampa Bay Devil Rays scouted Josh Hamilton  
for three years, and on Wednesday, they got their man. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, an outfielder from Athens Drive High School in North  
Carolina, became the first high school player drafted No. 1 since 
the Seattle Mariners chose Alex Rodriguez in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen him over the last three years and we believe Josh  
Hamilton was the finest player in the draft this year,'' Tampa Bay 
general manager Chuck LaMar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Right-hander Josh Beckett, from Spring High School in Texas, was  
taken by Florida with the second pick. Detroit selected Southern 
California catcher Eric Munson with the third pick. Arizona then 
chose shortstop Corey Myers from Desert Vista High School in nearby 
Scottsdale. Minnesota chose outfielder B.J. Garbe, from Moses Lake 
High School in Washington with the fifth pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, who is 6-foot-4 with size 19 feet, is an outstanding  
hitter projected to be a right fielder, even though he has a 94 mph 
fastball. He hit .514 with a school-record 13 homers and 36 RBIs 
this season, and is also regarded as a sound defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess not going No. 1 wouldn't have totally destroyed me,''  
Hamilton said. ``But there's prestige going No. 1, and I'm 
certainly happy to be No. 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While signing players has caused some teams serious heartache --  
the infamous Philadelphia-J.D. Drew saga is a recent example -- 
Hamilton would like to get on the field soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to get that done pretty fast,'' Hamilton said. ``I'll  
leave that up to my advisors to handle. I just want to play ball. 
'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beckett was the first high school righty taken as high as second  
since Bill Gullickson in 1979. He was 13-2 with an 0.39 ERA and 178 
strikeouts in 89 innings this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Beckett, also 6-4, impressed scouts with a fastball that hits  
the mid-90s consistently, and a lively curveball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being a first-round pick in the draft is the main thing.  
That's always been my dream,'' Beckett said. ``It's not about being 
the first or even the second. It's about being a first-round 
pick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Munson, who will be playing in the NCAA's super regionals  
against Stanford starting Friday, is hitting .338 with 14 homers 
and 40 RBIs. The left-handed power hitter missed 21 games because 
of a broken hand midway through the season, but picked up where he 
left off. 
</P>
<P>
	Myers hit .560 and set an Arizona high school record with 22  
homers. 
</P>
<P>
	Garbe hit .500 with six homers and 22 RBIs this season. Garbe, a  
two-sport star, was the first high school quarterback in the state 
to run and pass for over 1,000 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal selected left-hander Josh Girdley from Jasper High  
School in Texas with the sixth pick. Girdley struck out 29 in 10 
innings earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
	With the seventh pick, Kansas City chose North Carolina  
right-hander Kyle Snyder. Pittsburgh, picking eighth, went with 
high school right-hander Bobby Bradley, who threw seven one-hitters 
this season for Wellington High School in Florida and was 12-1 with 
an 0.38 ERA and 156 strikeouts in 92 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland took Southern California left-hander Barry Zito, who had  
three 16-strikeout games this season, with the ninth pick. 
Milwaukee selected Northeast Louisiana right-hander Ben Sheets 
(14-1), who had a 20-strikeout game against Louisiana Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati Reds selected Ronald LeFlore, son of former major  
league outfielder Ron, in the sixth round. LeFlore was an 
outfielder at Pinellas Park H.S. in Florida. Montreal chose Largo 
(Fla.) H.S. shortstop Cletis Boyer, son of Clete Boyer, third 
baseman on five New York Yankees World Series teams, in the seventh 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore, which had four first-round picks, took Clemson  
right-hander Mike Paradis with the 13th pick, left-hander Richard 
Stahl from Newton High School in Georgia with the 18th pick, Ball 
State outfielder Larry Bigbie with the 21st pick and Providence 
outfielder Keith Reed with the 23rd. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego, with three first-rounders, took outfielder Vince  
Faison from Toombs County High School in Georgia with the 20th 
pick; Gerik Baxter, a right-hander from Edmonds-Woodway High School 
in Washington with the 28th; and right-hander Omar Ortiz from 
Texas-Pan American with the 29th. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Cubs, with the 26th pick, took Wichita State  
right-hander Ben Christensen, who was suspended by the Missouri 
Valley Conference for hitting Evansville's Anthony Molina in the 
head with a warmup pitch before a game April 23. 
</P>
<P>
	The pitch cut Molina over the left eye, broke his cheekbone and  
may have caused permanent damage. Before the suspension, 
Christensen was 9-1 with a 2.40 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know he regrets the whole thing happening,'' Cubs general  
manager Ed Lynch said. ``In our judgment, he's an outstanding young 
man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anaheim, Atlanta, Cleveland and the New York Mets had no  
first-round picks.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Increases U.S. Commitment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AIR FORCE ACADEMY, Colo. (AP) -- President Clinton increased the  
U.S. pledge for a Kosovo peacekeeping force to 7,000 troops 
Wednesday and said America must not grow weary and ``abandon a just 
cause'' in the conflict with Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some things are worth fighting for,'' the president said in a  
commencement address to a new generation of military leaders: the 
804 men and 140 women graduating in the academy's class of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a brilliant sun, the president snapped a salute and shook  
hands with each diploma-clutching graduate in Falcon Stadium. In a 
roaring finale, the Air Force Thunderbird jets roared over the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton announced he was deploying 68 more aircraft, including  
four dozen fighters, for the NATO mission. That will bring the 
total number of U.S. aircraft supporting the airstrikes to 769. 
</P>
<P>
	He also announced the United States would contribute about 7,000  
troops to a 50,000-member NATO peacekeeping force that would enter 
Kosovo as part of a peace settlement to oversee the return of 
hundreds of thousands of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally, the United States had offered to send 4,000  
peacekeepers for a 28,000-member international force, but the U.S. 
commitment was upped as the anticipated peacekeeping needs grew. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton sought to rally support for airstrikes in Yugoslavia as  
polls show declining support for the campaign and an accompanying 
drop in his own job approval rating. His speech came on the eve of 
a White House meeting with the nation's top military leaders to 
discuss the conflict, including the possibility of an eventual 
ground invasion to oust Slobodan Milosevic's forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot grow weary of this campaign because Mr. Milosevic  
didn't capitulate when the first bombs fell,'' the president said 
on the 71st day of airstrikes. ``We cannot abandon a just cause 
because an adversary holds out for more than a few news cycles. I 
reject that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Answering growing criticism of U.S. involvement, Clinton said  
the United States has both a moral and strategic stake in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why are we in Kosovo?'' he asked. ``Because we have a moral  
responsibility to oppose crimes against humanity and mass ethnic 
and religious killing and cleansing where we can,'' the president 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because we have a security responsibility to prevent a wider  
war in Europe, which we know from our two world wars would 
eventually draw America in at far greater cost in lives, time and 
treasure,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton disputed claims that NATO's bombing triggered  
Milosevic's campaign of executions and expulsions of ethnic 
Albanians from Kosovo. He said Milosevic had done the same thing 
earlier in Bosnia and Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ethnic cleansing in Kosovo was not a response to bombing,''  
Clinton said. ``It is the 10-year method of Mr. Milosevic's 
madness. Had we done nothing, the tragedy would have been 
permanent, accepted and, in effect, condoned by the world 
community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Expressing determination to prevail, Clinton said, ``We have  
acted quickly to end this horror and that is exactly what we will 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If NATO had failed to act, Clinton said, ``Slobodan Milosevic  
would then have become a model of success for 21st century rulers 
trying to obliterate multiethnic societies, instead of the symbol 
of bankrupt policies based on hate that we want to confine to the 
dustbin of history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton singled out for recognition two academy alumni flying  
Kosovo missions -- a B-2 bomber pilot and a C-130 cargo plane pilot. 
They stood, to cheers, but were not named because they are still 
flying missions in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the U.S.  
contribution to a peacekeeping force probably would include three 
armor battalions from the 1st Infantry Division, nicknamed the 
``Big Red One, in Germany, which would translate to roughly 3,000 
soldiers with tanks and other heavy armor; several battalions of 
Army engineers; an aviation group with transport and attack 
helicopters; a military police battalion and an artillery 
battalion.

They stood, to cheers, but were not named because they are still 
flying missions in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the U.S.  
contribution to a peacekeeping force probably would include three 
armor battalions from the 1st Infantry Division, nicknamed the 
``Big Red One, in Germany, which would translate to roughly 3,000 
soldiers with tanks and other heavy armor; several battalions of 
Army engineers; an aviation group with transport and attack 
helicopters; a military police battalion and an artillery 
battalion.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks To Extend China Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will ask Congress to extend  
normal trade relations with China on Thursday, reigniting an annual 
debate that has been made even more emotional this year by spying 
accusations and an accidental bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. relations with Beijing have been strained recently by the  
allegations that China stole nuclear secrets from U.S. research 
facilities and by NATO's mistaken bombing of the Chinese Embassy in 
Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton remains convinced that engagement with China is key  
to improving relations and helping businesses in both nations. And, 
after some angry rhetoric, Congress is expected to go along with 
the one-year extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions between the United States and China forced  
administration negotiators to abandon hopes of negotiating China's 
entry to the World Trade Organization in time for Congress to vote 
on renewed trade ties and a WTO deal at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton plans to send his decision to Congress on Thursday,  
officials said Wednesday. Congress then will have 90 days if it 
wants to overturn the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1974 law, the president must seek an annual waiver to  
extend normal trade status to totalitarian states. Since 1980 every 
president has urged extending that status for China. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite concerns about human rights in China, Congress has never  
rejected such a request. 
</P>
<P>
	Resistance has been increased this year by anger over  
allegations that the Chinese government tried to influence U.S. 
elections by funneling donations to Democrats, coupled with 
concerns that Chinese spies stole nuclear technology from the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in  
Belgrade, which was blamed primarily on faulty intelligence, has 
halted trade talks between the two nations about the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the United States exported $14.3 billion in goods to  
China last year and imported $71.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., a member of the GOP leadership,  
said that strengthening economic ties to China has been ``a 
powerful force for positive change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we'll have success with it,'' he said. There is strong  
Republican support for this, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Dreier drew a distinction between Clinton's call for a  
``strategic partnership'' with China and what Dreier sees as a 
straight business deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This business relationship is one that's very important for  
our economic future and the economic future of the 1.3 billion 
people in China,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade imbalance with China is second only to the one with  
Japan. That's one reason why the administration, and Republicans 
such as Dreier, are eager to get China into the WTO, where it would 
have to grant more open access to its markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of  
Manufacturers, urged Congress to support extending trade relations 
and said that ``integrating China into the WTO would also foster 
stability in our commercial relations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a favor we are doing the Chinese, but rather a favor  
we would be doing ourselves,'' Jasinowski said.

<HEADLINE> Briggs-Botha Winner Wants Tyson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shannon Briggs grew up in the same Brooklyn  
neighborhood as Mike Tyson and has always wanted to fight the 
former world champion. 
</P>
<P>
	The only person who may stand in the way is Francois Botha.  
</P>
<P>
	Briggs (31-2, 25 KOs) and Botha (39-2, 24 KOs) will meet in a  
heavyweight bout on August 7 in Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
	Both are already talking about Tyson.  
</P>
<P>
	``My ultimate goal is to be the heavyweight champion, but I got  
into boxing because I wanted to fight Mike Tyson and now I feel I'm 
within one win of getting that chance,'' Briggs said at a New York 
news conference Wednesday. ``Fighting Tyson is like a title shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Botha, who beat Axel Schulz in 1995 for the IBF title and was  
stripped of it later after testing positive for steroids, knows all 
about Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	He was leading Tyson on all three cards after four rounds in a  
bout this past January before being knocked out in the fifth round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I can easily beat Mike and I think I proved it in those  
rounds,'' Botha said. ``I beat myself in that fight, but this time 
I won't lose my concentration and won't get too cocky and 
arrogant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight, Briggs' first appearance with Showtime, will be shown  
on the cable outlet's pay-per-view. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a new beginning for me,'' Briggs said. ``It's going to  
give my fans and some people who don't like me a chance to see me 
again. I haven't been very active with a hand injury, but I'm back 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Botha, Briggs has also had opportunities in big fights. He  
took advantage in 1997 when he won a decision over George Foreman. 
But Briggs was stopped in the fifth round of a title shot against 
Lennox Lewis in March of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Botha is a guy I can really showcase my skills against,''  
Briggs said. ``I can really shine on this man and make him look 
bad.''

<HEADLINE> Officer Sues in Tailwind Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A former Army officer quoted in a story  
that accused U.S. commandos of using nerve gas to hunt down 
defectors during the Vietnam War has sued three media groups for 
more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Van Buskirk, a former Special Forces lieutenant, filed  
suit Wednesday against CNN, Time and Time Warner Inc. over the 
story that was later retracted. His defamation lawsuit seeks 
$75,000 in compensatory damages and $100 million in punitive 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Buskirk has been ``shunned by many persons with whom he  
previously had social or business relations, and by his former 
comrades in arms, and has suffered mental anguish by being accused 
of war crimes and murder,'' according to the lawsuit filed in 
federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit is based on a joint CNN-Time story telecast on June  
7, 1998, that claimed the military used sarin gas in Laos during 
Operation Tailwind, a mission to find defectors. Two U.S. defectors 
were supposedly killed in the attack, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The story was retracted after an internal investigation could  
not substantiate the allegations. Time and CNN, both owned by Time 
Warner, apologized for the story. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Buskirk's attorney, Elihu Berman, said Van Buskirk's chief  
argument is that he was cited as the primary source for what was 
inaccurate information. 
</P>
<P>
	A Time magazine spokeswoman said she could not comment on the  
lawsuit. A Time Warner spokeswoman referred phone calls to CNN, 
where a spokesman declined comment.

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom Provides Local Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MCI WorldCom's new local service in New York has  
signed up 75,000 residential phone lines after four months, 
suggesting that consumers may want the same choices in local 
calling they enjoy in long distance. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York customers who've switched to MCI WorldCom for local  
service represent about 15 percent of the company's long-distance 
business in the state, John Donoghue, senior vice president for 
mass markets, said Wednesday at a company briefing with industry 
analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's more (local customers) than I thought they would have  
just starting in February this year,'' said Rex G. Mitchell, an 
industry analyst for Banc of America Securities in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The update by MCI WorldCom, the first since the new service was  
launched, also indicates that people may prefer to pay a single 
bill for various services such as local and long-distance calling, 
Internet access, and even television. 
</P>
<P>
	``It demonstrates that the nation has a fair amount of appetite  
to have one provider -- the single bill and the single point of 
contact, and when something's wrong, they can call one company,'' 
said Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	Also at Wednesday's meeting, MCI WorldCom expressed confidence  
in Wall Street's profit forecasts for 1999 and 2000, and again 
brushed aside the suggestion it needs to buy a wireless calling 
company to compete effectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, MCI WorldCom announced a deal to buy the paging  
company SkyTel Communications, but remains the only major telephone 
concern without a wireless calling operation. In recent months, the 
company has backed off on bids to acquire both AirTouch 
Communications and Nextel Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that someday we will have an opportunity to be in  
mobile wireless, but the level of the need has not risen to the 
level where we feel we have to do something,'' said chief executive 
Bernard J. Ebbers. The company might be forced to act, he said, 
``when a significant number of customers say if we don't have it, 
they won't buy from us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 75,000 lines receiving MCI WorldCom's local service  
represent only about 1 percent of the residential market in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's latest foray into local calling struggled at  
first, signing up just 10 lines a day, before growing rapidly in 
April and May, Donoghue said. He projected that revenues from local 
service to New York households will reach $50 million in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the strong showing, local service remains a marginal  
business for MCI WorldCom, which expects New York to generate $400 
million in sales of long distance services during 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, residential services remain a secondary concern for  
communications companies because they make more money serving 
businesses and the residential market is growing more slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding Internet access, consumer businesses account for less  
than a third of MCI WorldCom's annual revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom introduced local service across most of New York  
state in early February, leasing lines from the Northeast regional 
monopoly, Bell Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Local competition has been a thorny issue since 1984, when the  
government company broke up AT&AMP;T into a long-distance phone company 
and seven ``Baby Bells'' providing local service to specific 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
	While competition for long-distance service has flourished over  
the past 15 years, pushing down prices, most consumers still have 
only one choice for local phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, Congress passed legislation designed to pry  
open the local market, but long-distance providers and the Baby 
Bells continue to wrangle over the access fees and logistics for 
leasing the local wires that go into people's homes. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T has abandoned that fight, choosing to bypass the Bell  
system with the cable TV wires that also go directly into homes. 
Over the past year, AT&AMP;T has assembled a ``local'' network covering 
about 60 percent of the country, buying two of the nation's four 
biggest cable companies and partnering up with the other two.

<HEADLINE> Nuke Waste Site Safety Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Signs of ancient groundwater flooding at the  
proposed Yucca Mountain site for nuclear waste in Nevada could put 
the project's safety in question, a Russian scientist says. 
</P>
<P>
	Geologist Yuri Dublyansky of the Russian Academy of Sciences  
said Tuesday the flooding problem he found may be a ``potential 
show-stopper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Designers of the long-delayed project hope to seal off the  
radioactive waste underground for 10,000 years or more, when it 
will have decayed to safer levels. 
</P>
<P>
	James Paces, who has studied the site with the U.S. Geological  
Survey, challenged Dublyansky's conclusions. He said evidence 
indicates a seepage of rainwater, not water welling up from below. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists spoke at a conference of the American Geophysical  
Union, a group of astrophysicists, geologists and other scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Energy Department is studying whether to bury spent,  
highly radioactive fuel from the nation's nuclear plants and 
weapons programs at Yucca Mountain, about 90 miles from Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, more than 42,000 tons of lethal commercial waste is  
being kept at nuclear plants, mostly in cooling pools not designed 
for permanent safekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
	Yucca Mountain is the only site under consideration for  
permanent storage. The waste would be sealed in metal containers 
within rock tunnels about 1,000 feet underground and 1,000 feet 
above the water table. The site would begin operating in 2010 at 
the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	Community concerns, politics and fears of earthquakes and water  
seepage have slowed progress. Government officials have 
acknowledged they cannot be certain the site will keep waste 
totally sealed for thousands of years. But they have said the site 
appears workable. 
</P>
<P>
	Dublyansky studied the formation of calcite mineral crystals  
beneath the mountain and said only groundwater could be 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	But Paces said other research indicates the crystals were formed  
by rainwater seepage. ``There's pretty good evidence that the 
repository was never saturated,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Gambling Panel Urges Campaign Limits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Nearing the end of its work, a federal  
commission on gambling urged states to curb political contributions 
from companies in the gambling business. 
</P>
<P>
	If carried out in state legislatures across the country,  
Wednesday's recommendation could choke off a large source of money 
for state and local campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also left intact a controversial section saying  
governments ``may wish to impose an explicit moratorium on gambling 
expansion while awaiting further research and assessment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By a 6-3 vote, the National Gambling Impact Study Commission  
approved language recommending that states ``adopt tight 
restrictions on contributions to state and local campaigns by 
entities -- corporate, private or tribal -- that have applied for or 
have been granted the privilege of operating gambling facilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendation is a watered-down version of New Jersey's ban  
on political contributions from casino interests, their employees 
and agents. 
</P>
<P>
	It came as members of the commission sat down to complete work  
on a report that commission members will vote on this week and then 
release to the White House, Congress, and others on June 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Richard Leone, a former New Jersey state treasurer  
who proposed the recommendation to the commission on political 
donations, said he would have preferred a ban covering individuals 
as well as companies, and federal races as well as state and local 
ones. But he said he settled for what was possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's half a loaf, but it's a tasty loaf,'' Leone said.  
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey's law has been upheld in state court. Still, Alan  
Feldman, a spokesman for Mirage Resorts, predicted legal challenges 
to any new laws singling out the gambling industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would love to see across-the-board campaign finance reform.  
The system is out of control,'' Feldman said. ``But we don't like 
the discriminatory overtones this specific recommendation 
suggests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vote resolved one of the final major issues confronting the  
nine-person commission after two years of work. 
</P>
<P>
	Gambling interests have become prodigious donors at the state  
and federal levels. The National Institute on Money in State 
Politics says that in 10 states it has studied so far, gambling 
interests gave more than $1.5 million in the 1997-98 election 
cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Center for Responsive Politics reported the gambling  
industry donated more than $6.2 million to federal candidates and 
parties in the 1997-98 election cycle, twice what it gave during 
the previous midterm elections. 
</P>
<P>
	And Common Cause, a group that advocates campaign finance  
reform, reported that from May through July 1996, as Congress was 
shaping the powers of the gambling commission itself, gambling 
interests gave $1.6 million in unregulated ``soft money'' to both 
parties -- more than 13 times more than in a comparable period in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Robert Loescher, an American Indian and Alaska  
businessman, said curbing campaign contributions means stifling 
free expression. ``I think the American way is to put up your best 
ideas and let them win in the court of public opinion,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission went into its final meetings with dozens of  
recommendations already decided, including a nationwide minimum age 
of 21 to place bets, less aggressive state lottery advertising and 
more funding of programs to treat gambling addicts. 
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting in April, the commission split 5-4 in approving the  
language urging state and local governments to consider a 
moratorium on more lottery games, casinos and slot machines. 
Pro-gambling commissioners who opposed that language chose not to 
reopen the issue Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday the commission adopted a recommendation calling for  
a federal agency to gather information each year on state lottery 
operations, including demographic statistics on who plays and how 
much they spend. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission chairwoman Kay James said the nine-member commission  
does not need to reach consensus on every idea. But she said she 
hopes for an overall report that is ``acceptable to every member.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The draft report says the commission's nine members  
``unanimously agree that there is a need for a 'pause' in the 
growth of gambling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it later adds: ``It is clear that the American people want  
legalized gambling, and it has already sunk deep economic and other 
roots in many communities. Its form and extent may change -- it may 
even disappear -- but for the present, it's a reality.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Andro May Grow Breasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A new study finds that the dietary supplement  
used by slugger Mark McGwire may promote breast enlargement, heart 
disease and cancer instead of boosting men's strength. 
</P>
<P>
	The study published in today's Journal of the American Medical  
Association compared androstenedione with a dummy pill in 20 men 
ages 19 to 29 during an eight-week weightlifting program. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers found the supplement had no effect on testosterone  
levels in the blood, and no difference in strength could be found 
between the two groups of men. 
</P>
<P>
	Androstenedione -- pronounced an-droh-STEEN-die-ohn -- is a  
naturally occurring hormone that the body uses in tiny amounts to 
make the male hormone testosterone, which promotes tissue growth. 
Supplements, touted as a testosterone booster and muscle builder, 
contain many times the amount found in the body naturally. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, the St. Louis Cardinals baseball player who hit a  
record 70 home runs last year, has said he uses the supplements to 
speed recovery from minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say there's absolutely no reason to think  
androstenedione had anything to do with his slugging,'' said lead 
author Douglas. King, an exercise biochemist at Iowa State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	All the study subjects were new to weight training and made  
rapid strength gains during the study. 
</P>
<P>
	But the men who took the supplement -- 300 milligrams daily --  
showed significant declines in levels of ``good'' cholesterol, 
which protects against heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Androstenedione also raised the men's levels of the female  
hormone estrogen, King said. Elevated levels of estrogen in men are 
known to promote breast enlargement and are also associated with a 
higher risk of pancreatic and possibly other cancers. 
</P>
<P>
	The study did not measure breast size. King said such an effect  
probably would take longer to occur. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire had no comment on the findings. A furor erupted last  
year when he acknowledged that he used androstenedione following a 
report by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball spokesman Pat Courtney said the league has  
``some of the leading people in the field, along with the players' 
association, looking at the issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You just can't hurry,'' he said. ``I'm sure they will take  
everything into consideration in their findings. We're waiting to 
hear the results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hormonal effect of androstenedione in men is the opposite of  
what has been reported in women. In a paper 37 years ago, 
researchers reported that two women who each took 100 milligrams of 
androstenedione on a single occasion had four- to seven-fold 
increases in their blood levels of testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
	No other medical literature on the topic exists, the researchers  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts not involved in the new study praised it but said it  
leaves many questions unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the most comprehensive study on androstenedione that's  
ever been done,'' said Dr. Joel Finkelstein, an endocrinologist at 
Massachusetts General Hospital. But ``what we really need are 
higher doses and larger groups of men studied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finkelstein and a colleague, Dr. Benjamin Leder, are conducting  
their own study with the support of major league baseball, which is 
looking at whether to ban the supplement. The National Football 
League, the Olympics and the National Collegiate Athletic 
Association already have banned it. 
</P>
<P>
	Both researchers said they are prohibited from discussing their  
study before it is published, under standard medical-journal rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Charles Yesalis III, a professor of health and human  
development at Pennsylvania State University, said testing the drug 
in athletes might reveal some slight benefit that would not emerge 
from the type of subjects King studied.

<HEADLINE> Officer Sues in Tailwind Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A former Army officer quoted in a story  
that accused U.S. commandoes of using nerve gas to hunt down 
defectors during the Vietnam War sued three media groups Wednesday 
for more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Van Buskirk, a former Special Forces lieutenant, filed  
suit against CNN, Time and Time Warner Inc. over the story that was 
later retracted. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Buskirk has been ``shunned by many persons with whom he  
previously had social or business relations, and by his former 
comrades in arms, and has suffered mental anguish by being accused 
of war crimes and murder,'' according to the lawsuit filed in 
federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit is based on a joint CNN-Time story telecast on June  
7, 1998, that claimed the military used sarin gas in Laos during 
Operation Tailwind, a mission to find defectors. Two U.S. defectors 
were supposedly killed in the attack, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The story was retracted after an internal investigation could  
not substantiate the allegations. Time and CNN, both owned by Time 
Warner, apologized for the story. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Buskirk's attorney, Elihu Berman, of Clearwater, Fla., said  
Van Buskirk's chief argument is that he was cited as the primary 
source for what was inaccurate information. 
</P>
<P>
	His defamation lawsuit seeks $75,000 in compensatory damages and  
$100 million in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	A Time magazine spokeswoman said she could not comment on the  
lawsuit. A Time Warner spokeswoman referred phone calls to CNN; a 
CNN spokesman declined comment.

<HEADLINE> Europe: Dollar Mixed; Gold Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The dollar was mixed against other major  
currencies in European trading Wednesday, and the troubled euro 
slipped to a record low. Gold was lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0371, down from $1.0449 Tuesday, as  
analysts painted a bleak picture for the recovery of the currency 
from the steep losses suffered against the dollar over the past few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	In Frankfurt, Germany, European Central Bank officials met to  
discuss the currency, weakened by a decision to allow Italy to 
increase its budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Other dollar rates compared with late Tuesday: 120.71 Japanese  
yen, down from 120.95; 1.5338 Swiss francs, up from 1.5230; and 
1.4798 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4800 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound was quoted at $1.6103, up from $1.6072.  
</P>
<P>
	In midday trading in New York, the dollar was worth 120.83 yen,  
while the euro was worth $1.0345 and the British pound was worth 
$1.6060. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately, though they remain in use. Based on euro 
rates, the dollar is worth: 1.8859 German marks, up from 1.8718; 
6.3249 French francs, up from 6.2777; 2.1249 Dutch guilders, up 
from 2.1090; 1,867.00 Italian lire, up from 1,853.07. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold closed in London at $266.20 bid per troy ounce, down from  
$266.90 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Zurich the bid price was $265.95, down from $267.05.  
</P>
<P>
	Gold rose $1.10 in Hong Kong to close at $267.35.

<HEADLINE> Charge Reinstated Against Hubbell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court reinstated a criminal  
charge that Webster Hubbell engaged in a scheme to conceal legal 
work he and Hillary Rodham Clinton did on a fraudulent Arkansas 
land deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-judge panel unanimously rejected on Tuesday Hubbell's  
argument that one of 15 charges against him should be dismissed as 
too vague. His trial is to begin Aug. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	An 85-paragraph section of the indictment enumerates some 50  
alleged lies by Hubbell over a six-year span to regulators from the 
Resolution Trust Corp. and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It cannot be the case that the more elaborate the scheme or  
the more numerous the acts of concealment, the less able the 
government is to charge a crime,'' said the court decision. The 
judges were Stephen Williams and Laurence Silberman, Republican 
appointees, and David Tatel, a Clinton appointee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hubbell's ... argument that the indictment fails to give  
sufficient notice because it provides too much detail is, to be 
charitable, unconvincing,'' the court added. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge James Robertson had ruled that the  
allegations against Hubbell were not specific enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators say the land development involved, a  
1,050-acre tract south of Little Rock called Castle Grande, was 
riddled with insider dealing and fictitious sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The project was owned by Mrs. Clinton's former Whitewater  
partner, Jim McDougal, and Hubbell's father-in-law, Seth Ward. Mrs. 
Clinton has testified repeatedly that she remembers almost nothing 
of her work on Castle Grande in 1985-86. Her work on the project 
was disclosed when her missing law firm billing records turned up 
in the White House family residence in 1996 under still-unexplained 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	Castle Grande cost McDougal's savings and loan close to $4  
million. The government eventually took over the failing 
institution at a cost to taxpayers of $65 million.

<HEADLINE> Space Station Readied for Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Discovery's astronauts are leaving  
the new international space station a little cozier and quieter for 
those who will follow in the year ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The space shuttle will pull away nearly 2 tons lighter Thursday  
evening after six days of linked flight. By late Wednesday, the 
seven astronauts had just about finished carrying gear into the 
space station. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the more than 100 items they stowed aboard the two-room  
space station: laptop computers, water, clothes, trash bags and 
spare parts. 
</P>
<P>
	The astronauts got the place ready for its first permanent  
occupants, who are scheduled to move in next March. 
</P>
<P>
	``We spent a lot of this mission stowing supplies for them, so  
it should be pretty comfortable,'' said Ellen Ochoa, the astronaut 
in charge of all the moving. 
</P>
<P>
	Because no one will be back until December, one of the crew's  
last chores was to photograph every inch of the interior to help 
engineers on the ground solve any problems that might crop up. The 
astronauts also did a photo survey of the exterior one last time. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronaut Daniel Barry said Wednesday it was less noisy back in  
the Russian-made section of the space station than when the crew 
entered Sunday night, thanks to the mufflers he and others placed 
over clattering fans, ducts and outlets. Before the repairs, the 
noise level was equivalent to that of a busy street corner. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry said he measured the noise level at 65 to 69 decibels  
before the foam mufflers were installed. Afterward, it was about 3 
decibels lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Zarya is still noisier than the American-made section, called  
Unity, Barry said. ``But it certainly isn't a problem to be able to 
converse or do work in terms of the sorts of things we've been 
doing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA is far more concerned about the effects of noise on the  
astronauts who will spend months living aboard the space station. 
</P>
<P>
	The NASA engineer in charge of space station acoustics, Jerry  
Goodman, said before the mission that he wanted the noise level 
down to 60 decibels, which is what the specifications call for, or 
at least the low 60s. ``If you go much above that,'' he said, 
``you'll have to wear hearing protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Space shuttle Atlantis is supposed to carry up more supplies in  
December, but only if the Russians launch the station's living 
quarters in November as planned. Russia's economic crisis has 
stalled work on that piece, and the arrival of the first permanent 
crew is already almost two years behind schedule.

<HEADLINE> Robertson Goes for Gold in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- Religious broadcaster Pat Robertson,  
who lost up to $7 million in a failed diamond-mining venture in the 
former Zaire this decade, is involved in a gold mine project in 
another African country. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberian President Charles Taylor has reached a mineral  
development agreement with Robertson's Freedom Gold Ltd., based at 
Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network headquarters in Virginia 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The for-profit company was incorporated in the Cayman Islands  
last December. Robertson is the company's president and sole 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	If the agreement is ratified by the Liberian legislature, the  
Liberian government will get a 10 percent equity interest in the 
company and Liberians will be offered the opportunity to purchase 
at least 15 percent of the shares after an exploration period, said 
Joseph Mathews, vice president of Freedom Gold. 
</P>
<P>
	The mining company has no connection to Robertson's television  
ministry, Mathews said. He said Robertson wants to help 
``kick-start'' Liberia's economy, which has been shattered by years 
of civil war.

<HEADLINE> Feds Warn of Mad Cow Donors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAITHERSBURG, Md. (AP) -- At least some Americans who visited  
Britain frequently at the height of the mad cow disease scare 
should be forbidden to donate blood back home, a federal panel 
recommended Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The advisers to the Food and Drug Administration expressed  
concern about a theoretical risk that a similar human brain disease 
might be able to spread through blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Panel members stressed that their vote did not mean that  
frequent travelers to Britain are at risk of getting a fatal 
illness linked to mad cow disease -- or of spreading it through 
their blood. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is that scientists just don't know if the illness  
can be spread that way. There's never been a human case where that 
happened. But at issue is a new fatal disease that doctors don't 
yet understand -- and some scientists have successfully transmitted 
similar illnesses to animals through blood. 
</P>
<P>
	``The day you find out there is (human) transmission, you're  
years too late'' to protect the blood supply, warned Dr. Linda 
Detwiler of the U.S. Agriculture Department as the panel voted 12-9 
that FDA should forbid some blood donations. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA is not bound by its advisers' recommendations, but  
typically follows them. 
</P>
<P>
	If it does so in this case, it must decide how long someone had  
to stay in Britain to be deemed enough of a risk to refuse their 
blood. 
</P>
<P>
	That's crucial because an American Red Cross study found almost  
23 percent of recent blood donors had traveled to Britain at least 
once between 1980 and 1996. If the FDA barred them all, the United 
States would face a critical blood shortage. 
</P>
<P>
	The advisory panel said the concern is not a typical week-long  
tourist trip. Instead, a majority said Americans must have spent a 
total of over six months in Britain between 1980 and 1996 before 
being blocked from donating blood. Some advisers wanted the time 
extended to over a year, excluding fewer people. 
</P>
<P>
	Blood donations are dropping every year even as demand for blood  
increases, and every summer and during holidays parts of the 
country experience serious shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	If the FDA blocks travelers who spent a total of six months in  
Britain, there will be a 2.2 percent drop in the U.S. blood supply, 
the Red Cross study said. 
</P>
<P>
	A majority of FDA's advisers said even though the risk is only  
theoretical, it makes sense to be conservative in protecting the 
public. Some noted that critics say the AIDS epidemic might have 
been mitigated had doctors taken a more aggressive stand to protect 
the blood supply in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue this time is an infection that kills by literally  
eating holes in brain tissue. In cows, this condition is called mad 
cow disease -- and from the late 1980s through 1996, British cows 
suffered an epidemic. Mad cow disease also has been found in cattle 
in certain other countries, but Britain was hardest hit. 
</P>
<P>
	About one in 1 million people around the world gets a similar  
brain disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD. Although 
CJD sometimes is hereditary, usually its cause is not known. 
</P>
<P>
	The worry about blood stems from Britain's discovery in the  
mid-1990s that some people caught a new variety of CJD apparently 
by eating beef infected with mad cow disease. Named ``new variant 
CJD,'' it has claimed 39 British victims. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no known mad cow disease in U.S. cattle, the United  
States has not allowed importation of British beef for over a 
decade and no American has caught new variant CJD. 
</P>
<P>
	But because these brain diseases can incubate for years without  
causing symptoms, some scientists say the possibility exists that 
years from now they will discover a link between blood transfusions 
and infection. Indeed, doctors are closely watching Britain to see 
if that happens. 
</P>
<P>
	The British government now imports drugs made from blood plasma  
from other countries, although British researchers told the FDA 
panel Wednesday that they simply cannot predict the risk, if any. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian health officials last month decided they, too, would  
determine how to block blood donations from certain Canadians who 
traveled to Britain.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Down 18.37 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices closed mixed today as investors  
prepared themselves for a possible increase in interest rates but 
nonetheless went in search of bargains in the battered technology 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average was down 18.37 to close at  
10,577.89. The index fell as much as 131.40 points earlier in the 
session before erasing most of the losses in the final hour of 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were slightly higher after paring big  
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 0.55 to 1,294.81, and the  
technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index rose 20.36 to 2,432.39. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,635 down, 1,358 up and 570 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 726.14 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
681.99 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 0.78 to 620.50, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 4.88 to 771.23. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.72 to 436.74.  
</P>
<P>
	An afternoon speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan  
helped calm a jittery market. The influential policy-maker kept his 
remarks at an international business conference in Boston tightly 
focused on trade, and did not address interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The market has been rattled for more than two weeks by  
persistent fears that the Fed will soon raise rates to cool off the 
booming economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest bull market in history has been aided and abetted  
by a friendly Fed,'' said Larry Wachtel, a market analyst at 
Prudential Securities. ``Everyone is afraid of what will happen if 
the Fed turns unfriendly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Dow remained in a narrow trading range throughout  
Greenspan's speech, market watchers still strained to catch any 
hints he might offer about the Fed's future course. Alan Skrainka, 
chief market strategist at Edward Jones of St. Louis, said many 
expect the Fed to raise interest rates when its Open Market 
Committee meets June 29. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed doesn't want to shock the system, so Greenspan's  
lieutenants have been warming us up for a while,'' he said. 
``People are selling on the rumor of a rate hike, so they may buy 
when the news hits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wachtel said the market is likely to remain off-balance at least  
until Friday, when the Labor Department will report May's 
unemployment figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the emotional component of that report, there won't be  
any real direction until then,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices continued their tumble after a robust report on new  
home sales. The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond 
recovered slightly by this afternoon, yielding 5.93 percent, but 
the yield had soared to 5.97 in earlier trading. 
</P>
<P>
	A yield of 6 percent is viewed as a critical point for stocks,  
because at that level, yields make bonds a more attractive 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest rate worries depressed bank and financial stocks today,  
with J.P. Morgan leading decliners. The financial sector is 
especially vulnerable to higher interest rates because lending 
volume shrinks when it becomes more expensive to borrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet companies began the day by tumbling yet again, but  
their weakened prices enticed some buyers. America Online dropped 
sharply in early trading, but turned higher late in the session. 
Yahoo posted a strong gain after Sprint Corp.'s PCS Group agreed to 
offer Yahoo content to users of its wireless phones. 
</P>
<P>
	Online brokerages mirrored their more conventional rivals and  
were mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Bookseller Barnes &AMP; Noble rose slightly after it called off its  
planned acquisition of book distributor Ingram Book Group. The 
company's online wing, barnesandnoble.com, fell.

<HEADLINE> Belmont Stakes Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With dozens of photographers and cameramen  
recording his every move, Triple Crown hopeful Charismatic arrived 
at Belmont Park late Wednesday morning after a delayed trip from 
Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight carrying the Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner,  
potential spoilers Prime Directive, Pineaff and the filly 
Silverbulletday, along with several other racehorses, was delayed 
90 minutes in Louisville due to bad weather, but had a smooth trip 
after takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``At 6 a.m. as we were getting ready to leave the barn, it got  
black and started lightning and pouring,'' trainer D. Wayne Lukas 
said after the chestnut colt was safely unloaded, bathed and 
settled into his stall at barn 10. ``I was concerned with getting 
to the airport, let alone getting into the air. We waited about an 
hour and a half and then loaded in a light rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as we took off and got above the storm everything was  
smooth. But the delay didn't bother Charismatic. The lightning was 
crackling, but he loaded well, he wasn't worried. He takes 
everything in stride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday, looking to become the third filly to win the  
1 1/2-mile Belmont, was transported to the racetrack from the airport 
in a separate horse van, arriving at barn 50 a half-hour after 
Charismatic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to find out if she fits -- I think she fits,''  
trainer Bob Baffert said. ``The mile and half? We don't know. I 
just hope when they come to the quarter pole, that she's still 
kicking in and by then we'll know what's going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TRIPLE SURVIVORS:* Nineteen horses ran in the Kentucky Derby,  
but just four will complete the Triple Crown series in Saturday's 
Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	They are: Charismatic, the Derby and Preakness winner; Menifee,  
the Derby and Preakness runner-up; and Adonis and Stephen Got Even, 
both trained by Nick Zito. Stephen Got Even was 14th in the Derby 
and fourth in the Preakness, while Adonis was 17th in the Derby and 
sixth in the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TRIPLE TIME:* For the third straight year, there's a chance for  
a Triple Crown champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer D. Wayne Lukas, whose Charismatic has a shot at becoming  
racing's 12th Triple Crown winner if he can win Saturday's Belmont 
Stakes, says the time is right for racing hero. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the public likes to see it, I think we're in the  
crossroads of racing,'' he said Wednesday during the draw for post 
positions at Belmont Park. ``The tracks are changing ownership, the 
NTRA (National Thoroughbred Racing Association) has done a great 
job marketing, and I think the timing is right to show the American 
public that we're not always on page 14 of the sports section, that 
we can move up a few pages.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ANTLEY TIPS:* As Chris Antley gears up for his Triple Crown  
shot aboard Charismatic, the jockey with the on-line stock market 
newsletter also has a Triple Crown tip for investors: 
</P>
<P>
	``Yahoo!, MCI and AOL,'' he said, ``that's my Triple Crown.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BAFFERT LOGIC:* Trainer Bob Baffert said his star filly  
Silverbulletday wasn't really ready to run in the Kentucky Derby 
and an outside post position kept her out of the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belmont, though, seems to be the right fit for  
Silverbulletday, who has won 11 of 12 career starts against her own

	``Now we feel good about it, this is the time (to run her),''  
Baffert said. ``Winning the Triple Crown is either meant to be or 
not meant to be. I lost the last two. If Charismatic wins, it's a 
great story. If my filly wins, it's a great story, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last Triple Crown winner was Affirmed in 1978; the last  
filly to win the Belmont was Tanya in 1905.

<P>
	 *LONG SHOT:* Teletable, the longest shot in the Belmont at 99-1  
on the morning line, went for a 1 1/2-mile gallop Wednesday morning, a 
routine he will follow until Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belmont will be his first race since Feb. 15, when he broke  
his maiden at Gulfstream in his fourth career start. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good horse and he's doing real well so we decided to  
run him in the Belmont,'' trainer Alfredo Callejas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Callejas has saddled four horses in past runnings of the  
Belmont, the most recent being Mr. Energizer, who was seventh in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>

	 *GOOD LUCK:* Peter Pan winner Best of Luck is scheduled to have  
his final work for the Belmont Thursday morning, said New 
York-based trainer Allen Jerkens, nicknamed ``the Giant Killer'' 
for his knack at pulling off huge upsets in major races. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think he has a great chance in here,'' Best of Luck's  
jockey, Jean-Luc Samyn, said. ``He ran great in the Peter Pan. But 
he will have to step up to win.''

<HEADLINE> 3-Year-Old Watched Mother's Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGETON, N.J. (AP) -- A 3-year-old girl who tried to stop her  
pregnant mother from being killed by a burglar was left alone with 
the body for 17 hours until she was found hiding under a bed sheet. 
</P>
<P>
	Laquanda Fedd, 22, surprised a man who had broken into her home.  
During a struggle, her daughter Braizonna tried to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
	``He pushed me onto the floor,'' she said Wednesday. ``I hit him  
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said David Mosley, 24, grabbed a knife that was in the  
house and slashed Fedd's throat. He faces murder, burglary and 
weapons charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Fedd, a single mother who worked two jobs and was four months  
pregnant, died at the scene. Her body lay undiscovered until Fedd's 
mother, alerted by the victim's employer that she missed work, went 
to check on her. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl was found hiding under a sheet in a bedroom when  
relatives came by the house on Tuesday. It wasn't clear how the 
girl occupied herself after the killing. She told relatives she ate 
some peaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Braizonna seemed unfazed by the killing as she played outside  
her grandmother's home Wednesday. Relatives said they weren't sure 
the girl understood what she had seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw him. He was in my mom's room,'' she said. ``My mommy got  
a pink nose. I saw my mommy laying on the floor.''

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Stacey Kent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The road of life can sometimes detour in  
unexpected directions, taking you places you never imagined. Just 
ask jazz vocalist Stacey Kent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago, Kent was a comparative literature major at Sarah  
Lawrence College, fully expecting to go on to graduate school and a 
career in academia. Today, the 31-year-old is one of the 
fastest-rising jazz stars in Britain, and is building a following 
in the United States with her new album, ``Love Is ... the Tender 
Trap,'' a mixture of standards like the Gershwins' ``They All 
Laughed'' and undiscovered gems from the ``Great American 
Songbook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kent, whose father is an architect and mother is a magazine  
editor, was constantly exposed to music while growing up. But she 
never thought of becoming a professional singer. 
</P>
<P>
	Fate intervened when, after graduating from college, she took  
some time off to travel in Europe. While visiting some college 
friends at Oxford in 1991, she met several musicians who were 
heading to London to audition for a jazz course at the Guildhall 
School of Music and Drama. On a whim, she auditioned, too, and was 
accepted, despite her lack of formal musical training. 
</P>
<P>
	At Guildhall, she met tenor saxophonist Jim Tomlinson -- a  
philosophy major turned musician who shared her taste for older 
swing styles. They eventually married and settled in North London, 
recording and playing together to form a special partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent was asked to sing with the '30s swing band Vile Bodies for  
Ritz Hotel dances. She got more exposure when she appeared as the 
big band vocalist in the opening scene of the 1995 film, ``Richard 
III,'' which starred Ian McKellen. 
</P>
<P>
	Her demo tape made an enthusiastic backer of BBC radio jazz  
presenter Humphrey Lyttelton. In the liner notes to her debut 
album, ``Close Your Eyes'' on Britain's Candid label, Lyttelton 
wrote that her voice ``strong and clear ... has the invigorating 
tang of vermouth.'' The collection of mostly moody, yearning 
ballads was one of Britain's best-selling jazz albums of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Her follow-up album, ``The Tender Trap,'' released this year in  
the United States by the Chiaroscuro label, is more upbeat and 
swinging. Kent doesn't scat or use vocalese like some other jazz 
singers, preferring a more straight-ahead approach. She has an 
engaging, girlish voice, delivering the lyrics in a relaxed, 
swinging style with crystal-clear diction. 
</P>
<P>
	Mostly through word of mouth and a profile on ``CBS Sunday  
Morning,'' her CD became a top-seller on the major Internet music 
sites despite almost no advertising. Recently, on a trip home to 
visit her family on Manhattan's Upper West Side, Kent spoke over 
brunch about the unlikely twists her life has taken. 
</P>
<P>
	1. What experience singing did you have before you went to  
Europe? 
</P>
<P>
	Kent: I didn't have any professional experience singing, and I  
never thought about doing it. ... I didn't realize until I became a 
professional singer just how much I actually wanted to sing as a 
child. 
</P>
<P>
	It was obvious to my family that I had a good ear and could  
sing. I was always asked to sing at family events. My sister and I 
always sang together. ... I was interested in old movie musicals -- 
Fred Astaire movies were my absolute favorites. And afterward, I 
would try to figure out the songs on the piano. 
</P>
<P>
	I had years of piano lessons. I was in the chorus in high school  
and did a couple of school shows. But so did a lot of my friends 
who are now doctors and lawyers. Music was one of those 
extracurricular activities, and I was just a little bit better at 
it. But at the same time, it wasn't like anybody was thinking, 'Oh, 
she's honing a career towards music.' 
</P>
<P>
	2. Do you think it was luck, fate or talent that you ended up a  
jazz singer? 
</P>
<P>
	Kent: I guess it's a bit of all those things. In a way, I think  
it was meant to be. Even though I tried other things that I thought 
were important to me, it was always music that was my greatest 
passion. 
</P>
<P>
	I also got lucky. If I hadn't met those musicians who were going  
to audition for Guildhall at that time, I might not have done it. I 
might have just come home after my stint in Europe and got a job 
doing something else. Then again, if I didn't have the drive, it 
wouldn't have lasted either. 
</P>
<P>
	That was a very inspiring thing for me to learn in my 20s that  
you can think you're going somewhere and go somewhere else. ... It 
makes me feel very optimistic about life. It means that if you're 
not happy where you are, you can change direction. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Does anything in your background as a comparative literature  
major relate to what you're doing as a jazz singer? 
</P>
<P>
	Kent: Absolutely. I think that the thing that attracted me to  
comparative literature and languages in the first place is very 
much related to my love of music. I grew up in a household where my 
mother always read aloud to us, so storytelling was very important 
to us growing up. Also, I was a language student because I loved to 
speak languages. 
</P>
<P>
	I think in a way I've come full circle because now I look at my  
songs very much as telling a story. OK, it's not the size of a 
Dickens novel, but it's a little story in itself. ... I tell 
stories and play with my ear as a musician in the same way I did as 
a language student. 
</P>
<P>
	4. How would you describe your singing style and approach?  
</P>
<P>
	Kent: It's very straight-ahead and uncomplicated. I just hear it  
in my head and I snap my fingers and away we go. There are a lot of 
questions. Is it jazz? Is it swing? What is it? I can completely 
understand that people need to categorize it. 
</P>
<P>
	I don't know exactly where I belong. I just know that where I am  
is the right place. I'm a singer of the 'Great American Songbook,' 
a singer of popular song. It's not today's pop, but it works as 
today's pop. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The element of swing is very important to me. It's a physical  
not a cerebral music. It makes people want to tap their toes and 
swing their shoulders. The feel is very important, but so is 
delivering and telling the story. I tell the story like we're 
talking right now. It's very natural. 
</P>
<P>
	I also think what's crucial for any singer is to sing with the  
voice you've got. I have a little bit of a girlish thing in my 
voice. ... I have to sing with exactly what I've got. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Why do you think these older songs from the ``Great American  
Songbook'' still resonate with audiences today? 
</P>
<P>
	Kent: It's a magical repertoire. These songs have all the  
elements that a singer would want. The melodies are so strong, the 
harmonies are beautiful and the lyrics are brilliant. I think they 
are timeless stories. They are love songs and very romantic. 
There's a real optimism -- not that they're all 'happy ending' 
stories. ... Even though the language might have changed from 1937 
to 1999, it's still universal and timeless enough that I can apply 
it to my modern life. 
</P>
<P>
	I don't feel old-fashioned. It's so much fun to watch the  
audience because it's so infectious. It's a 'feel good' music. ... 
I'm such a romantic. I feel pretty lucky. It's a tough world and 
I'm doing what I want to do -- singing great songs and delivering 
them to people who want to hear them.

<HEADLINE> ABC Defends Purchase of Video </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC on Wednesday defended its $16,000 purchase  
of videotapes and photographs of one of the Columbine High School 
gunmen, saying the transaction adhered to the network's policy of 
not paying for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	However, if the material is used again the network will inform  
viewers that the footage was paid for. 
</P>
<P>
	The material was aired last week on ``Good Morning America''  
along with an interview of Nathan Dykeman, a friend of Dylan 
Klebold. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC insisted it wasn't paying for an interview, since Dykeman  
appeared a week earlier on ABC News programs to talk about his 
friendship with Klebold. At the time, ABC was not aware of the 
videos and photographs, spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would never pay money for videotapes or home videos with  
the proviso that we get an interview. We felt this material was 
editorially useful. We thought that it explained more about the 
story,'' Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dykeman was brought back after the sale to explain what his  
material showed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold and classmate Eric Harris gunned down 13 people at the  
Colorado school on April 20 before shooting themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC bought broadcast rights to home video of Dykeman driving to  
school with Klebold, during which the boys joke about blowing up 
the high school. Another video, part of a school project, shows 
Klebold dressed in a trench coat and pouring lighter fluid on the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Dykeman's school yearbook also shows disturbing messages written  
by Harris and Klebold, including the words ``kill them all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the interview, ABC correspondent Don Dahler said on the  
air that the network had ``obtained the rights'' to the material. 
</P>
<P>
	``To us, that means we paid for it,'' Murphy said. ``But perhaps  
that's not as clear as it should be. 
</P>
<P>
	The material could be used again, perhaps on Friday when ``Good  
Morning America'' airs a town meeting on teen-age violence hosted 
by President Clinton at the White House. If it is, ABC will make 
clear that it paid for the videos and photos, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're not willing to acknowledge that we've bought  
something, perhaps we shouldn't have bought it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert on media ethics said that some news organizations pay  
for outside material, such as video of a tornado. But if it's 
something out of the ordinary -- as it was in this case -- the 
network should disclose the arrangement to viewers, said Bob Steele 
of the Poynter Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele said the payment disturbed him, since it appeared someone  
was profiting from a tangential involvement in a tragedy. Even 
worse, it raises the prospect of an unseemly bidding war. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's troubling to me that ABC becomes a partner in that kind  
of decision,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom Provides Local Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MCI WorldCom is providing its new local service  
in New York to 75,000 residential phone lines, a sign that 
consumers are hungry for choices in a market that's always been 
dominated by a Bell monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
	The update Wednesday, the first since the service was launched  
four months ago, also bolsters the argument that people may prefer 
to pay a single bill for various services such as local and 
long-distance calling, Internet access, and even television. 
</P>
<P>
	The customers who signed up for MCI WorldCom's local service  
represent about 15 percent of the company's long-distance business 
in New York, John Donoghue, senior vice president for mass markets, 
said at a company briefing with industry analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's more (local customers) than I thought they would have  
just starting in February this year,'' said Rex G. Mitchell, an 
industry analyst for Banc of America Securities in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``It demonstrates that the nation has a fair amount of appetite  
to have one provider -- the single bill and the single point of 
contact, and when something's wrong, they can call one company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also at Wednesday's meeting, MCI WorldCom expressed confidence  
in Wall Street's profit forecasts for 1999 and 2000, and again 
brushed aside the suggestion it needs to buy a wireless calling 
company to compete effectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, MCI WorldCom announced a deal to buy the paging  
company SkyTel Communications, but remains the only major telephone 
concern without a wireless calling operation. In recent months, the 
company has backed off on bids to acquire both AirTouch 
Communications and Nextel Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that someday we will have an opportunity to be in  
mobile wireless, but the level of the need has not risen to the 
level where we feel we have to do something,'' said chief executive 
Bernard J. Ebbers. The company might be forced to act, he said, 
``when a significant number of customers say if we don't have it, 
they won't buy from us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 75,000 lines receiving MCI WorldCom's local service  
represent only about 1 percent of the residential market in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's latest foray into local calling struggled at  
first, signing up just 10 lines a day, before growing rapidly in 
April and May, Donoghue said. He projected that revenues from local 
service to New York households will reach $50 million in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the strong showing, local service remains a marginal  
business for MCI WorldCom, which expects New York to generate $400 
million in sales of long distance services during 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, residential services remain a secondary concern for  
communications companies because they make more money serving 
businesses and the residential market is growing more slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding Internet access, consumer businesses account for less  
than a third of MCI WorldCom's annual revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom introduced local service across most of New York  
state in early February, leasing lines from the Northeast regional 
monopoly, Bell Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Local competition has been a thorny issue since 1984, when the  
government company broke up AT&AMP;T into a long-distance phone company 
and seven ``Baby Bells'' providing local service to specific 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
	While competition for long-distance service has flourished over  
the past 15 years, pushing down prices, most consumers still have 
only one choice for local phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, Congress passed legislation designed to pry  
open the local market, but long-distance providers and the Baby 
Bells continue to wrangle over the access fees and logistics for 
leasing the local wires that go into people's homes. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T has abandoned that fight, choosing to bypass the Bell  
system with the cable TV wires that also go directly into homes. 
Over the past year, AT&AMP;T has assembled a ``local'' network covering 
about 60 percent of the country, buying two of the nation's four 
biggest cable companies and partnering up with the other two.

<HEADLINE> Teamsters, Haulers Reach Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Teamsters union on Wednesday settled a  
closely-watched contract dispute with trucking companies that haul 
new cars to showrooms across the country, averting a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed agreement, which still must be ratified by a  
vote of union members, drivers would get better retirement 
benefits. Trucking companies would gain more leeway to schedule 
some workers for weekend shifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Teamsters president James P. Hoffa declared the settlement a  
union victory, saying it ``beat back'' major employer demands, 
including lower wages for newly-hired drivers and the use of 
part-time workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ian Hunter, chief negotiator for the National Automobile  
Transporters labor division, which represented the trucking 
companies involved in the dispute, said the companies were 
``especially pleased that a strike has been averted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters contract with 17 trucking companies that hauled  
more than 15 million cars from assembly plants, ports and rail 
yards to dealerships last year covers about 12,800 drivers, 
mechanics and yard and office workers. It was originally scheduled 
to expire at 12:01 a.m. EDT on Tuesday, but the union twice agreed 
to delay the strike deadline so that negotiations could continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Auto industry analysts said a strike by truck haulers would have  
directly affected consumers as well as car companies, causing long 
waits for new-vehicle buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa predicted that union members will overwhelmingly ratify  
the new contract in a ballot by mail within a few weeks. And he 
expects to play a similar high-profile role in the union's future 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first major step of the Teamsters union coming  
back,'' Hoffa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa's participation at the bargaining table -- a first since he  
was sworn in as Teamsters president in March -- also attracted 
attention to the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The new union leader has pledged to restore unity in Teamsters'  
ranks in the wake of a divisive campaign finance scandal. Also, he 
is the son of one of the Teamsters most famous former leaders: 
Jimmy Hoffa, who was sent to prison for jury tampering and misusing 
union funds, then disappeared after his release and is presumed 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
	AFL-CIO president John Sweeney praised Hoffa for refusing to  
consider a proposal by the trucking companies to use Mexican 
drivers to deliver vehicles in the United States after the 
U.S.-Mexican border opens up Jan. 1 under the North American Free 
Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiators for the employers said they dropped that idea weeks  
ago and called the attention drawn to it ``political 
grandstanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But regardless of such details, Democratic party consultant  
Victor Kamber said the interest generated by Hoffa could prove an 
asset to the labor movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``His presence raised the visibility of the issue, of the  
subject of unions, and all of this is positive,'' Kamber said. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics within the Teamsters complained that Hoffa gave away too  
much in his first major negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's made such a big test of this and now he's flunked his  
test to give concessions in a booming auto industry,'' said Ken 
Paff, national organizer for Teamsters for a Democratic Union, an 
internal faction that opposed Hoffa's election. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed contract, additional full-time mechanics  
hired by the trucking companies could be scheduled to work flexible 
shifts to help cover weekend hours -- for example, four 10-hour 
rather than five 8-hour days. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hoffa gave away weekends ... now they will be able to schedule  
people on the weekends at no double time,'' said Paff. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the union traded a raise for drivers this year for a  
one-time $1,500 bonus. In each subsequent year of the four-year 
contract, wages will rise by 50 cents an hour. Union haulers 
currently earn about $68,000 a year in wages and benefits, with 
salaries of $55,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa said he was looking for a ``win-win'' agreement that would  
keep jobs secure by helping trucking companies stay competitive. 
Although prosperous Americans have been snapping up new cars 
lately, the companies said they have lost business in recent years 
to railroads and nonunion haulers. 
</P>
<P>
	Teamsters officials said union negotiators also had in mind  
internal surveys that have shown retirement benefits to be among 
union members' chief concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The new car-haulers' agreement would give drivers who choose to  
retire after 25 years of work better pension benefits, including 
health insurance for those aged 55 and older. Also, retirees over 
65 would get new prescription drug benefits to supplement 
government Medicare coverage.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Megan McFall took a deep breath, wished away  
the hiccup attacks that often appear when she's nervous and 
successfully spelled ``c-h-r-y-s-a-n-t-h-e-m-u-m.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no hiccup. That was just a blank,'' Megan, a  
13-year-old home-schooler from West Farmington, Ohio, said of her 
noticeable hesitation Wednesday before starting to spell in the 
72nd annual Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee. Nevertheless, at 
the end of the first of two days of spelling by the 249 
contestants, Megan was still in the running -- with 104 other 
spellers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the 9- to 15-year-olds spelled with their hands stuffed  
deep in their pockets. Others gazed at the ceiling for inspiration 
and hoped they wouldn't hear the elimination bell. The bee got off 
to a swift start because of a new policy that gives judges more 
guidance in disqualifying contestants who spell as slow as 
m-o-l-a-s-s-e-s. 
</P>
<P>
	Kristina Rodriguez, a 14-year-old from Brownsville, Texas, was  
one of three spellers who almost succumbed to the policy. On 
Kristina's third word, she asked several times for the definition, 
pronunciation and origins of ``glycolytic,'' which refers to the 
chemical breakdown of glucose. 
</P>
<P>
	After three minutes and seven seconds, twice as long as the 90  
seconds officials generally allowed on the first day, judges 
insisted Kristina spell the word, which she did correctly to stay 
in the contest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't study this hard to be disqualified,'' she said during  
a break. Under the guidelines, adequate times to spell words are 90 
seconds for easier words from the first day, and two minutes for 
the harder words in the final rounds Thursday, but the judges have 
leeway. 
</P>
<P>
	Suspense also came when judges asked to hear a tape of Kristen  
Davis' spelling of ``pomeridian,'' meaning blossoming after noon. 
The 12-year-old from Stuart, Va., however, spelled it 
``poneridian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of parents, siblings and sponsors cheered the spellers --  
even when they missed -- in the ballroom of a downtown Washington 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	While some weathered tongue-twisters like ``prestidigitator,''  
``meistersinger'' and ``xerostomia,'' others were stumped by the 
likes of ``sousaphone,'' ``rapport'' and ``suffocate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kyle Trujillo, one of two 9-year-olds in the contest and,  
ironically, from Tuba City, Ariz., missed ``sousaphone.'' He 
spelled it ``suziphone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other 9-year-old and the youngest contestant, fourth-grader  
Shante Lewis from Plainfield, N.J., also was eliminated in the 
first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Without hesitation, Elise West, 13, of Memphis, Tenn., correctly  
spelled ``tentativeness.'' Sarah Sinnett of Powellsville, N.C., 
kept her cool while acing ``discombobulate.'' And the audience 
applauded and chuckled when Angela Arenivar, 14, of Perryton, 
Texas, pumped her fists and jumped up and down after squeaking out 
the spelling of ``wheedle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zachary Holland Baker, 13, of Parsons, Tenn., ended his  
first-time appearance by misspelling his first word -- 
``siphonapterology,'' a branch of entomology concerned with fleas. 
He was tripped up by the previous speller's word, ``psychedelic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I had the p-s-y thing still in my mind,'' he said. ``I hoped I  
would get past the first round. That's the hardest round. I wanted 
a chance at $10,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contestants, most sponsored by their local newspapers, all  
won regional bees to qualify. The winner Thursday will receive 
$10,000, a choice of encyclopedias and other prizes. 
</P>
<P>
	Scripps Howard announced Wednesday that Jamaica, home of last  
year's champ, will return to the competition next year after being 
banned this year for holding its local qualifying contest too 
early. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy that Jamaica has found a way back into the  
competition,'' said Karin Daley of the Daily Gleaner, the newspaper 
that will sponsor Jamaican contenders for the national bee. 
</P>
<P>
	Scripps Howard, the newspaper group based in Cincinnati,  
coordinates the national finals and produces the word lists and 
study materials.

<HEADLINE> Barnes &AMP; Noble Halts Ingram Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Barnes &AMP; Noble, the world's largest bookstore  
chain, called off its $600 million purchase of the world's biggest 
book distributor Wednesday because of opposition from antitrust 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes &AMP; Noble and Ingram Book Group said they worried that  
their businesses would suffer during a prolonged review by the 
Federal Trade Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Some FTC staff members had concluded that the merger could give  
Barnes &AMP; Noble an unfair competitive position. 
</P>
<P>
	``The review process has been disappointing to us,'' Ingram  
chairman John R. Ingram said. ``The events of the last several days 
have made it clear that some staff hold an outdated view of the 
marketplace, making an objective analysis of the transaction 
impossible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal has been under fire since it was announced in November.  
</P>
<P>
	Critics said it could allow Barnes &AMP; Noble to delay delivery of  
best sellers to independent stores and big rivals such as Borders, 
or gain access to its competitors' buying practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes &AMP; Noble, however, had said the acquisition would have  
allowed Ingram to distribute a wider selection of titles and Barnes 
&AMP; Noble to deliver books faster and at lower cost. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Booksellers Association, which represents 3,400  
independent bookstore companies, had been the most vocal opponent 
of the proposed merger. 
</P>
<P>
	``This shows that David can beat Goliath sometimes,'' said Oren  
Teicher, chief operating officer of the booksellers group. 
</P>
<P>
	``When this proposed deal was first announced, virtually nobody  
predicted that this deal could be stopped. Small booksellers wrote 
letters, made phone calls, did everything to raise awareness of 
this issue, and against extraordinary odds, they have succeeded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky did not deny that the commission  
was considering blocking the deal. He cited concerns about whether 
small bookstores and Internet merchants would be injured if the 
merger were permitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes &AMP; Noble isn't the only company looking to expand its  
distribution network. Many booksellers, including Amazon.com, are 
building and acquiring centers around the country to make it easier 
and faster to get any book to any customer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingram, a subsidiary of privately held Ingram Industries Inc. of  
Nashville, Tenn., distributes trade books, audio tapes, textbooks 
and specialty magazines through 11 distribution centers around the 
nation. It ships 115 million titles every year. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes &AMP; Noble said it will use the $600 million it had  
earmarked for the merger for other investments and acquisitions. It 
will also go forward with plans to build two new distribution 
centers of its own, one in Reno, Nev., the other in Memphis, Tenn.

	WEST POINT, Miss. (AP) -- By winning the year's first major and  
ending a nearly three-year stretch without a victory, Dottie Pepper 
moved within single digits of the LPGA Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike many halls, the LPGA's is based solely on performance.  
Under requirements revamped this year, 27 points are needed for 
induction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before this season started, I felt if I could get my number  
down to single digits it would be considered a successful year,'' 
said Pepper, who has 19 points toward the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you win the first major, you start thinking a little  
bigger. If the world is a perfect place, we would be sitting here 
Sunday afternoon with only six points to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Women's Open, the season's second major, begins  
Thursday at Old Waverly Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the LPGA scoring system, players get one point for each  
career victory, scoring title and player of the year award. A 
victory in one of the LPGA's four majors is worth two points. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepper has 15 victories, including two Dinah Shore titles, in a  
13-year career. Before this year's Dinah Shore, her last victory 
was the LPGA Championship in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the criteria changes, players had to win 40 tournaments,  
35 with one major or 30 with two majors for induction into the 
hall. 
</P>

	 *PARK A PRO:* Get ready for another amateur to join the  
professional ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	Grace Park, the U.S. Amateur and NCAA champion, said Wednesday  
that she plans to turn pro after the U.S. Women's Open. She could 
not turn pro before the Open because her exemption is based on her 
winning the Amateur. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel I'm ready now,'' Park said.  
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't mean the 20-year-old South Korean, who moved to the  
United States when she was 12, is ready to act like a pro. 
</P>
<P>
	While IMG and Cornerstone Sports are the two agencies battling  
to sign Park, family associates say a decision likely will not be 
made until later this summer -- and any endorsements would not be 
sought until after she gets an LPGA Tour card. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Tiger Woods on the PGA Tour and Jenny Chuasiriporn, the  
Open runnerup who turned pro last week, Park does not plan to take 
any sponsor's exemptions into LPGA Tour events with hopes of 
getting her card. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, she plans to play the remaining eight events on the  
Futures Tour. She can earn her card by finishing in the top three 
on the Futures money list. If she finishes from fourth to 10th on 
the money list, she would be exempt to the finals of Q-school. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-time All-American at Arizona State, Park has been the  
top-ranked women's amateur and female college player the past two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *JENNY'S JOURNEY:* After making her professional debut in the  
U.S. Women's Open, Chuasiriporn will use sponsor's exemptions to 
play in three straight LPGA events in July. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took the first ones that came to me early,'' said  
Chuasiriporn, who needs the exemptions to play because she does not 
yet have an LPGA card. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuasiriporn, the 1998 U.S. Open runnerup as an amateur after  
her 40-foot birdie putt forced a 20-hole playoff, finished her 
college career last month as Duke won the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Her plans are to play in the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic, the  
Michelob Light Classic and the Big Apple Classic the first three 
weeks of July. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FUTURE SITE:* Sticking with a recent trend of taking its  
premiere women's event to rural America, the USGA said Wednesday 
that the 2002 Open will be played at Prairie Dunes Golf Club in 
Hutchinson, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's event is at Old Waverly Golf Club in West Point,  
Miss., after a stop last year in Kohler, Wisc., an hour from Green 
Bay and Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Next year's Open will be played outside of Chicago, but will  
also be played opposite the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	In 2001, the rural tour continues at Southern Pines in North  
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OWENS FUND:* The LPGA Foundation has established a fund for  
research and education in the name of DeDe Owens, a former 
president of the LPGA's teaching and club professional division. 
</P>
<P>
	The DeDe Owens LPGA Golf Education and Research Fund will  
support LPGA golf education and research projects with which Owens 
was involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens, who died May 16 of a heart attack, played four years on  
the LPGA Tour before joining the teaching and club pro division in 
1974. She was a teaching professional at Cog Hill Golf and Country 
Club in Chicago when she died.

<HEADLINE> British Supermarket Chain To Cut Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Britain's second-largest supermarket chain, J.  
Sainsbury, is cutting 1,100 jobs as part of an overhaul of its 
struggling business. 
</P>
<P>
	A 3 percent decline in last year's operating profit to 714  
million British pounds ($1.1 billion) was ``not acceptable,'' 
Sainsbury said Wednesday. The losses came despite a 5 percent 
increase in sales after the company opened 20 new supermarkets and 
expanded 22 others. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive Dino Adriano said the layoffs are part of the  
company's plan to save 160 million pounds ($256 million) over the 
next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sainsbury employs 130,000 people in 415 stores. Long identified  
with middle-class British shoppers, its has recently lost market 
share to more innovative rivals like Tesco. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have radically reassessed our current position and  
prospects,'' Adriano said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said its five-year plan will focus on enlarging its  
stores, shortening the time customers must wait in check-out lines, 
introducing new products and expanding its lower-priced range of 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong growth at its Homebase chain of do-it-yourself hardware  
centers and the U.S.-based Shaw's supermarket chain helped offset 
weakness in the British food retailing business, Sainsbury said.

<HEADLINE> Arrest Warrants for Mich St Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Arrest warrants were issued Wednesday  
for Michigan State basketball players Mateen Cleaves and Antonio 
Smith on misdemeanor larceny charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Police pulled over the players on April 14 because their vehicle  
matched the description of one reportedly involved in a store 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said he hadn't seen the complaint  
or the police reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my understanding that the matter will be dealt with in  
the courts, and after the judicial process runs its course I'll 
take appropriate action,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 23, also was charged with malicious destruction of  
property. He is accused of breaking open a convenience store cooler 
door lock. 
</P>
<P>
	The crimes are punishable by up to 93 days in jail.  
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves, the team's point guard, led Michigan State to the NCAA  
tournament's Final Four for the first time in 20 years last season. 
He said last month he would return for his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, the Spartans No. 3 career rebounder, completed his  
eligibility in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to contact Cleaves and Smith were unsuccessful, but the  
Lansing State Journal reported that the players' lawyer hadn't seen 
the warrants or police reports Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's way too premature to comment,'' lawyer Brian Jeffries  
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Auto Sales Exceed Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Automakers posted one of their strongest U.S.  
sales months ever in May, exceeding the industry's own expectations 
as demand for new cars and light trucks showed no sign of slowing. 
</P>
<P>
	``A record year is within reach,'' Ford Motor Co. marketing  
chief Bob Rewey said Wednesday as the automakers released their 
sales figures for the month. ``May was a blockbuster sales month 
for Ford and the industry -- stronger than we expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	May's year-to-year gains were expected to be muted because of  
the comparison to a particularly robust May 1998, when sales were 
boosted by a discount coupon war between General Motors Corp., Ford 
and what was then Chrysler Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	But a burst of sales over the long Memorial Day weekend helped  
most automakers end the month with impressive gains. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of the two or three strongest months ever; maybe the  
strongest month that wasn't influenced by changes in the tax law or 
other artificial stuff,'' said analyst David Healy of Burnham 
Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford posted one of the biggest increases -- up 10 percent  
compared with a year ago. It had a surprising 18 percent increase 
in car sales, excluding its Jaguar and Volvo models. Ford's light 
trucks -- pickups, sport utility vehicles, vans and minivans -- were 
up 6 percent for a May record. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chrysler half of DaimlerChrysler AG was up 6 percent for its  
best month ever, led by an 8 percent increase in truck sales. James 
P. Holden, vice president of marketing and sales, said the 
company's economists keep expecting the market to soften, but so 
far there's no evidence of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market feels mighty strong, and I don't see that  
changing,'' Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM was the biggest disappointment in May's sales contest. Its  
sales were off 5 percent. Despite its hot-selling full-size 
pickups, overall sales of GM's light trucks declined 2 percent; its 
full-size SUVs took the biggest hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``All year long they've been giving away market share to the  
foreign brands while Ford and DaimlerChrysler have held their 
own,'' Healy said. ``May was just another example of that 
intensified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	European automakers once again had the greatest percentage  
gains. Although European companies sell far fewer vehicles in the 
United States than either the domestic or Asian automakers, they 
have been steadily gaining market share over the past two years, 
mostly at the expense of GM. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the Europeans have had double-digit, year-over-year  
percentage gains for the past 21 months. In May, Volkswagen AG 
posted a 56 percent increase for its best May in 20 years; Saab 
Automobile AB, half-owned by GM, more than doubled its sales from a 
year ago; Ford's Volvo Cars unit was up 21 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Asian automakers also did well last month. Honda Motor Co. was  
up 6 percent for its best May, and Nissan Motor Corp. posted a 10 
percent gain 
</P>
<P>
	Ford announced Wednesday it would boost its second-quarter  
production by another 20,000 vehicles to a total of 1.282 million 
vehicles -- up 8 percent from the same quarter of 1998. It was 
Ford's third increase since its second-quarter production schedule 
was announced in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's reports came as the industry dodged a potential  
threat to its profits, as the Teamsters union and trucking 
companies that transport new vehicles to dealers reached agreement 
on a new contract and averted a threatened strike.

<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations is trying to arrange  
regular land convoys to deliver food and other aid to help ethnic 
Albanians still in Kosovo, the top U.N. humanitarian coordinator 
said today. Yugoslavia has already indicated it would allow such 
convoys. Time is running out for the estimated 600,000 people still 
living in the province without sufficient food, medicine or water, 
said Sergio Vieira de Mello, the U.N. official. The U.N. agencies

energy, more than $8 billion worth a year. Government agencies will 
be required to increase efforts to cut energy use for lighting,

those who survived today's three rounds will return to spell again

Jones got the final three outs for his ninth save.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays Like Hamilton's Ability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP)-- Josh Hamilton's most vivid dreams  
about draft day didn't compare to the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Carolina high school star wasn't surprised to be the  
No. 1 overall pick on Wednesday, but there was no way to project 
how it would make him feel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worked toward just being drafted my whole life,'' Hamilton  
said after the Tampa Bay Devil Rays selected him over Texas prep 
pitching prospect Josh Beckett and college catcher Eric Munson. 
</P>
<P>
	``But being the first pick is an honor. There are a lot of great  
players. I'm just excited that Tampa Bay thinks of me being the 
best player in the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were more than 50 family members, friends and reporters at  
Hamilton's home in Raleigh, N.C. when the 6-foot-4, 205-pound 
outfielder received a call from Tampa Bay scouting director Dan 
Jennings. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year-old left-handed hitter who draws comparisons to New  
York Yankees All-Star Paul O'Neill hit .529 with 13 homers and 35 
RBIs in 25 games as a senior at Athens Drive High School. He also 
stole 20 bases, walked 26 times and scored 34 runs while striking 
out just seven times. 
</P>
<P>
	Devil Rays general manager Chuck LaMar described Hamilton as a  
``classic five-tool'' player with the physical and mental makeup to 
develop into a star. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can run. He can field. He can throw. He can hit. And he can  
hit with power ... And if you had to add a sixth tool to it, it 
would be intangibles,'' LaMar said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know the attrition rate of players coming through a minor  
league system. But this young man not only has the God-given 
talent, but all the intangibles to reach the major leagues and have 
an impact for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The general manager stressed, however, that the Devil Rays don't  
have a timetable for Hamilton to reach the majors. He won't be 
rushed just because he's a No. 1 pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it would be very easy for me to say this guy is going  
to make it in this amount of years,'' LaMar said. ``We are not 
going to put that kind of pressure on his head. We're going to let 
him succeed at his own rate. He'll drive that train himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, a two-time North Carolina high school player of the  
year, also pitched this spring and had a 7-1 record with 91 
strikeouts in 56 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays project him as a right-fielder, a decision the  
first prep player to be taken as the first overall pick since Alex 
Rodriguez in 1993 doesn't argue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll always miss pitching. It's been a big part of my career,  
growing up and everything,'' Hamilton said. ``But I think position 
player is the right choice for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays insisted signability was not a factor in the  
decision to draft Hamilton, who said he's committed to turning pro 
and wants to put contract talks behind him as fast as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	LaMar said once a deal is done, Hamilton probably will begin  
with one of Tampa Bay's rookie league teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want it to be done as quick as possible, so we can get  
everything in order and I can go and start playing right away,'' 
Hamilton said, adding he's confident he'll be able to handle the 
added scrutiny that goes with being the No. 1 pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might put pressure on me,'' he said, ``but I don't think  
it'll bother me because I just out there to play and do what I've 
been doing my whole life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays are just as confident they made the right  
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've watched him for a long time,'' LaMar said. ``Josh  
Hamilton withstood every test that we gave him, whether it be his 
performance on the field or questions we asked. ... We feel like 
he's the No. 1 player in this draft.''

<HEADLINE> `NewsHour' Plans New Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The team behind public television's ``NewsHour  
with Jim Lehrer'' hopes to begin a second national newscast to 
compete with local late-night news shows early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, about a dozen PBS stations have agreed to air the show,  
which is being developed with The New York Times, said Robert 
MacNeil, the former ``NewsHour'' anchor who is working on it for 
MacNeil-Lehrer Productions. 
</P>
<P>
	MacNeil said the second newscast will provide a substantive  
alternative to the ``body bag'' journalism of late-night local news 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	MacNeil and Lehrer, his former partner, received Quinnipiac  
College's Fred Friendly First Amendment Award on Wednesday for 
their nightly newscast, which celebrates its 25th anniversary next 
year. MacNeil retired from the show in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Accepting their awards, both men sharply denounced TV networks  
for viewing news as entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	The late Friendly, the former CBS News president and Columbia  
University professor who helped put MacNeil and Lehrer together as 
a team, would be appalled at many news programs today, Lehrer said. 
</P>
<P>
	With their opinionated reporters, invasions of privacy and  
public leering, many news shows resemble professional wrestling, 
Lehrer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people are on to what's going on in television  
news,'' he said, ``and television news is either going to change or 
become even more irrelevant than it already is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MacNeil suggested the lust for ratings makes public television  
news even more important than when ``NewsHour'' began in 1975. Even 
PBS is not immune, said MacNeil, who suggested the recent 
controversy about PBS's ``Washington Week in Review'' illustrated 
what happens when ratings become paramount. 
</P>
<P>
	The show's former moderator, Ken Bode, walked away after he said  
new management there wanted ``more attitude'' at the program. 
Management denied the characterization, but it proved an 
embarrassingly public airing of differences. 
</P>
<P>
	``By dumbing itself down, by whoring just for numbers, public  
television will lose not only its numbers but its soul,'' MacNeil 
said.

<HEADLINE> Hrbaty in French Open Spotlight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Dominik Hrbaty is making a great run at the French  
Open, and he doesn't think much of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just play my matches and that is it,'' he said. ``I won some  
matches and I am in the semis, that's all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old Slovak beat Chile's Marcelo Rios on Tuesday in  
the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, all matches are the same,'' Hrbaty said. ``Satellite,  
world series, whatever. There is no difference between the matches 
here and other tournaments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hrbaty, who beat top-ranked Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia in the  
second round, eliminated the ninth-seeded Rios 7-6 (7-4), 6-2, 6-7 
(6-8), 6-3 to set up a semifinal with Andre Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
	And while Paris might be a magical place for some players, it's  
just another city for Hrbaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I ever see is the hotel and court, so it makes no  
difference to play in Paris or anywhere else,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Hrbaty, voted best newcomer by his fellow professionals in 1996,  
has taken time to break through. 
</P>
<P>
	His best previous Grand Slam performance came in the 1997  
Australian Open, where he reached the fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Hrbaty was in complete control against Rios, who had  
the best clay-court record in 1998 and was one of the tournament 
favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	``He played better than me,'' Rios said. ``I am not that fit  
yet, maybe because I didn't have time to get ready at the beginning 
of the year because of my injury. I had my chance at 3-all, love-40 
(in the first set). I didn't take that chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rios fought back to win the third set, thanks to a tiebreaker in  
which Hrbaty made five unforced errors. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hrbaty, who beat Rios and Agassi this year in Key Biscayne,  
Fla., always expected to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I beat him last time, so I was confident,'' Hrbaty said. ``I  
was thinking during the match, if you beat somebody once, you can 
beat him a second time.''

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Denies Agent Paid Florida LB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Sports agent Tank Black denies that he  
gave money to former Florida linebacker Johnny Rutledge, insisting 
police forced the player to lie about accepting payments, the 
agent's lawyer said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard Mungo, the lawyer, said he planned to ask the U.S.  
Attorney's office to investigate the way university police handled 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, Mungo wants to know whether Rutledge and  
former linebacker Jevon Kearse were threatened with perjury if they 
didn't change testimony that exonerated Black of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked with two of the Keystone Kops down there and they  
intimated to me that they were not happy with statements those 
players had given under oath'' in April, Mungo said. ``They weren't 
pleased with the statements because those statements completely 
exonerated Tank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rutledge, a second-round draft pick of the Arizona Cardinals,  
told Florida Today in Tuesday's edition that he had taken $500 per 
month over the span of a year from Black in exchange for an 
agreement to sign with Black's agency after the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``My friends know the story,'' Rutledge said. ``I've sat down  
and I've told them the story. I just mainly want to come clean with 
the people that have remained closest to me. It's just something I 
did. Now, I'm learning from it. I just hope I can move on and put 
all of this in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reached by The Associated Press on Wednesday, Rutledge refused  
to confirm the newspaper report. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to talk about it at all,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rutledge told the newspaper that he, Kearse and McGrew admitted  
taking money when questioned by police last month. Mungo said 
McGrew didn't make the admission, but Kearse and Rutledge did. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Kearse told Florida Today he hadn't been paid  
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after questioning from police, the three dropped Black and  
hired Leigh Steinberg to represent them. A fourth player, Mike 
Peterson, also was interviewed by police. He remains a Black 
client. 
</P>
<P>
	Mungo said the players originally told campus police that they  
had not taken money from Black or anyone associated with his 
company, Professional Management Inc., of Columbia, S.C. The lawyer 
says a few weeks later, Kearse and Rutledge were coerced into 
changing their stories. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time, they were harassed, no doubt, but they were  
not intimidated,'' Mungo said. ``The second time, they were 
intimidated. And I don't know why you would think you would get a 
trustworthy statement when an ax is hanging over your head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	University police spokeswoman Stacy Badics said the department  
had no additional comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the NFL Players Association filed a disciplinary  
complaint, accusing Black of illegally recruiting former Florida 
players to his company. 
</P>
<P>
	Mungo said he has asked the U.S. Attorney's office to  
investigate whether the NFLPA convinced university police to start 
the investigation and whether the NFLPA illegally used the police 
findings to further their own investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Black has until next month to answer the NFLPA's complaint.  
Mungo said he is working on a lawsuit asking federal court to take 
jurisdiction over the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	If Black is found guilty of violating Florida's agent law, he  
could receive a five-year prison sentence and up to $5,000 in 
fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Florida athletic department have said they  
don't anticipate problems with the NCAA or Southeastern Conference 
because they reported the violations immediately upon hearing of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	An official with the SEC agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``They've been trying for years to not let something like that  
happen,'' said Jim McCullough, the SEC's compliance officer. ``The 
fact that they turned it over to (university police) immediately 
after they knew about it shows me they're handling it the best they 
can.''

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Are Mixed / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices were mixed Wednesday after plunging  
the day before amid mounting inflation worries. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury fell 1/32 point, or  
$0.31 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, settled at 5.94 percent, barely higher from 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Short-term issues were unchanged, while intermediate-term issues  
ranged from 1/16 point lower to 1/32 point higher, according to 
Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The market struggled in the morning after the government  
reported that sales of new homes unexpectedly rose during April, 
aggravating worries the economy may be growing at an inflationary 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds tumbled on Tuesday after a manufacturing group reported  
that factory activity jumped during May to the highest level since 
October 1997. The report also showed that prices paid for factory 
supplies also rose in the month. Inflation makes fixed-income 
investments like bonds less appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Wednesday, yields on three-month Treasury bills  
fell to 4.71 percent from 4.75 percent in Tuesday's auction, while 
the discount fell 0.4 percentage point to 4.59 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month yields fell to 4.93 percent compared with 4.94 percent  
in Tuesday's auction, while the discount fell 0.02 percentage point 
to 4.74 percent. One-year yields fell to 5.03 percent from late 
Tuesday's 5.04 percent, as the discount fell 0.02 percentage point 
to 4.78 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.69 percent from 5.06 1/4 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 1/32 to 121 7/32. The average yield to 
maturity rose held steady at late Tuesday's 5.42 percent.

<HEADLINE> Another Lawsuit Against Dennis Rodman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Dennis Rodman is being sued again.  
</P>
<P>
	A Kentucky woman has filed suit against the flamboyant former  
NBA player, claiming he assaulted her in the lobby of a Las Vegas 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in state District Court by Rebecca  
Mardis of Laurel County, Ky., is the latest of several filed 
against Rodman in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Mardis alleges Rodman slammed her camera to the floor and lifted  
her into the air in a threatening manner, then laughed at her 
fright. The suit alleges it took place in January in the lobby of 
the MGM Grand Hotel when she tried to take his photo. 
</P>
<P>
	Messages to Rodman's representative at International Creative  
Management were not immediately returned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mardis seeks $1 million in punitive damages because she alleges  
Rodman has a history of assaulting people. In her lawsuit, Mardis 
alleges assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional 
distress and property damage. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 19, a casino security guard sued Rodman, accusing him of  
grabbing her breast while she was working at the Las Vegas Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
	Three lawsuits filed in Las Vegas in June 1998 involve other  
allegations about Rodman's behavior in casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	A Las Vegas Hilton employee accused him of grabbing her and  
lifting her off the ground in April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	A Las Vegas woman accused Rodman of sexually assaulting her in  
April 1998 at the Las Vegas Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
	A craps dealer at The Mirage filed a lawsuit alleging Rodman  
humiliated him at work by rubbing his groin and head. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman played for the Detroit Pistons and Chicago Bulls before  
joining the Los Angeles Lakers for a short stint this year. The 
Lakers waived him in April.

<HEADLINE> Report: Live Anthrax Spores Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. scientists have found live spores of the  
deadly anthrax bacteria in a pit on an Aral Sea island, where the 
biological weapon was supposed to have been buried safely more than 
a decade ago, The New York Times reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper described the Central Asia island where the pit is  
located, Vozrozhdeniye or Renaissance Island, as ``the world's 
largest anthrax burial ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of tons of anthrax bacteria, which were developed in  
the Urals region of Russia under the Soviet biological weapons 
program, were drenched in bleach, sealed in stainless steel drums 
and sent to the island by train. The bleach was to have killed the 
bacteria before it was buried in the sand, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	However, U.S. military scientists and intelligence officials,  
who have been studying the site for four years, found some of the 
spores survived and were potentially lethal, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Soviet republics of Uzbekistan and Kazakstan, which  
share the island, asked the United States for help in assessing the 
site's danger. Russia has not delivered on President Boris 
Yeltsin's 1992 pledge to close and decontaminate the site. 
</P>
<P>
	The danger of contamination has increased because the Aral Sea  
is drying up. As it does so, the island has grown in area, and 
local officials fear it will soon be connected with the mainland -- 
putting more people in danger from anthrax.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Bills Let Patients Sue HMOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Patients denied medically necessary  
treatment by their HMOs could sue the managed-care plans for 
damages under landmark legislation backed Wednesday by the 
California Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar bills passed by the Assembly and Senate would give  
patients power that federal law now denies to most people covered 
by employer-sponsored health plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Health maintenance organizations and other managed-care plans  
limit patients' choice of doctors in exchange for lower premiums 
and lower fees for checkups and prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	California is among at least 30 states debating whether to give  
consumers the right to sue HMOs for damages. A Texas law allowing 
malpractice lawsuits against the plans was enacted in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``HMOs will be much more likely to defer to patients' needs and  
doctors' requests for medically necessary treatment because they 
will fear the hammer of damages if they don't do the right thing,'' 
said Jamie Court of Consumers for Quality Care, which has long 
sought the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents said the measures would cause health care costs to  
skyrocket without really helping patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The bills passed with only Democratic support.  
</P>
<P>
	Each proposal needs approval from the other house before it can  
go to Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, who has not said whether he would 
sign either of them.

<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Dr. L. Joseph Butterfield, known as the father of  
neonatology, died Tuesday at his home in Denver. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Butterfield was known worldwide for his ideas about the care of  
newborn babies. His medical career spanned five decades and 
included a career-long affiliation with The Children's Hospital in 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>

Children's Newborn Center, among the first of its kind in the 
nation. His program, ``Newborn Country USA,'' became recognized as 
a national model for regional perinatal care.

<HEADLINE> Truck Carrying Explosives Overturns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- A tractor-trailer carrying 20 tons of  
explosive black powder for fireworks overturned on the Washington 
area's busiest highway interchange Wednesday, backing up traffic 
for 20 miles and forcing rush-hour commuters to sit and stew for 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The flatbed truck crashed at about 4 a.m. on an off-ramp in an  
interchange called the ``mixing bowl,'' where 370,000 drivers 
converge daily at the intersections of I-395, I-495 -- the 
Washington Beltway -- and I-95, the major highway from Maine to 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The interchange reopened about 8:30 p.m. after the powder  
containers were doused with water, inspected and loaded onto 
another vehicle for removal, state police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities cleared a 2,000-foot safety zone around the wreck,  
evacuating 200 people from 50 homes and sending many to a high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't even want us to get out of our pajamas,'' said  
Emmanuel Edim, 45, of Springfield. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the black powder spilled out of its cargo container,  
which had been sitting on the flatbed trailer. Hazardous-waste 
workers treated it gingerly to prevent an explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver, Juanita Kirk, 41, and her boyfriend were not  
injured. Ms. Kirk was charged with reckless driving. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the crash was under investigation.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kirk told police she heard a popping sound just before the  
rig overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	Accidents are common in the mixing bowl, one of the busiest  
interchanges on the East Coast. Construction has begun on an 
eight-year, $350 million improvement project. 
</P>
<P>
	The ramp where the accident occurred has had numerous truck  
crashes over the years, said Lucy Caldwell, Virginia State Police 
spokeswoman. Loads shift when the ramp is taken at high speed, 
causing trucks to roll over, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the wreck, local roads were clogged for miles as commuters  
fled the highways. Angry drivers honked their horns and ran red 
lights while talking on cell phones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everywhere I turned, it was a traffic jam,'' said Jenny Pena,  
20, of Springfield, after spending four hours in her car.

<HEADLINE> Ben Fine Looks Almost Any Part </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- You might swear you've seen him before. An  
ailing patient in a hospital? A kindly grandfather sure to offer a 
Hershey bar? Or that upper middle-class New Yorker? 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Fine has been all of these, sort of. For almost three  
decades, Fine has been a model for magazine ads -- even if he isn't 
ailing, doesn't really like chocolate and never lived in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``They might want a disheveled old man. They might want a  
successful CEO,'' he says. ``There's a picture for everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fine darts around his apartment, tossing aside papers, digging  
through drawers, searching for some particular shots he posed for 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not just his All-American looks, though one friend  
describes him as ``one of those guys who looks like everyone's 
grandfather.'' His energy and versatility have landed him in about 
75 ads placed in major publications across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't sit around and just watch television all day,'' Fine  
says. ``Once people hit their 50s and 60s they often lose their 
ambition, and they're fearful and afraid of dying. But as you get 
older, life is not over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a child Fine loved to dance, but his mother steered him away  
from the arts. He ultimately became a wholesaler of costume 
jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
	But when he hit 50, he decided to chase his childhood dream. He  
concentrated on acting, then modeling. 
</P>
<P>
	He moved from home in the suburbs to downtown, where he shares  
bachelor quarters with his cats, Boo-Boo and Little One. Even 
triple-bypass surgery didn't stop him. 
</P>
<P>
	His acting career took him to regional theater with small roles  
in shows such as ``The Fantastiks'' and ``Fiddler on the Roof.'' He 
was a TV extra on soaps such as ``All My Children'' and ``One Life 
to Live.'' Recently, he had a bit part as a doctor taking a pulse 
in ``Law &AMP; Order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But modeling delights him, whether he's portraying someone down  
on his luck or a successful CEO. Then there's Fine as ship captain, 
gardener with a wrenched back, orchestra conductor, waiter in a 
European cafe. 
</P>
<P>
	When the phone rings. Fine jumps. ``I don't know whether I'll be  
doctor, a patient or someone's grandfather,'' he says, before 
answering. ``I'll have to ask my agent what clothes to bring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His wardrobe includes 150 neckties, 20 suits and 60 shirts --  
plus a couple of detachable mustaches. Unlike high-profile models 
who display the clothes that designers provide, print models pull 
from their personal wardrobes for everyday looks. 
</P>
<P>
	Why does this work for Fine? He credits his innate ability to  
act. ``See, look at that face of anguish,'' he says, recreating 
that gardener with a strained back. ``To be a good print model you 
have to know how to act. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here in this ad, I'm smoking, and I don't smoke. It took four  
hours to get that shot. I thought I was going to die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a carpenter: ``I can't even saw a piece of wood.''  
</P>
<P>
	As the pope: ``And I'm so Jewish.''  
</P>
<P>
	He also is full of optimism, something you can't sell in an ad.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can't get into a fit of depression,'' he says.  
``Depression is the worst thing you can have. It makes you get sick 
and it ages you. ... If the phone doesn't ring, you can't let it 
bother you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What I tell people is that all they need is courage,'' he  
says. ``... Anyone can do it. All you need is an 8x10 glossy and a 
good attitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fine's knack for self-promotion helps, too. He is still  
shuffling papers, in pursuit of his favorite photos. Finally: 
``Found it!'' 
</P>
<P>
	One is a full-page magazine ad for a shipping company. Fine is  
posing as Mikhail Gorbachev, a slice of pizza in one hand and a 
flag with the company logo in the other. 
</P>
<P>
	``See, they painted his birthmark on my forehead,'' he says,  
pointing to the ``strawberry'' that was so distinctive on the 
former Soviet leader. ``I got a real kick out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another is a 1995 cover of New York magazine. As a dapper New  
Yorker, this lifetime Philadelphian stretches his 6-foot frame into 
an upper-middle-class citizen, perhaps in his 60s. 
</P>
<P>
	Fine was 75 at the time, but he confides that even today  
``people can never guess my age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Go ahead, guess, he urges, for the third time, just one hour  
after disclosing: 79.

<HEADLINE> Jury Deadlocks in University Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal court jury deadlocked Wednesday  
on accusations by the University of California that Genentech Corp. 
violated a university patent to develop the company's lucrative 
human growth hormone. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors voted 8-1 in the university's favor, but were unable to  
resolve the impasse during six days of deliberations, two jurors 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury resolved another issue in the university's favor,  
rejecting Genentech's claim the 1982 patent was invalid. That 
verdict will be binding in a retrial of the infringement issue, 
said U.S. District Judge Charles Legge. 
</P>
<P>
	The university accused Genentech, a leading biotechnology firm,  
of using stolen DNA covered by a UC patent to develop the 
top-selling hormone Protropin. 
</P>
<P>
	Genentech denied that genetic material taken from a UC San  
Francisco lab in 1978 was used to develop the treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit sought $400 million in damages, which could have been  
tripled for willful patent infringement.

<HEADLINE>  LSU Women Botch NCAA Track Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- For the want of a baton, the chance of LSU  
regaining the women's NCAA outdoor track and field championship 
went tumbling Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The first exchange between Joyce Bates and Chenelle Marshall in  
the 400-meter relay semifinals went awry and so did the Tigers' 
hope of taking back the title from Texas. The Longhorns, who ended 
LSU's 11-year reign last year, had no difficulty with their 
handoffs and won their heat in 43.20 seconds, a record for Boise 
State's Bronco Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	In breaking LSU's 1994 record of 43.26, Texas, the defending  
champion in the relay, led the way into Friday's final. 
</P>
<P>
	While the relay turned out to be the pivotal event of the  
competition, four finals also were contested. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford, which went 1-2-3 in the men's 10,000 last year,  
repeated again, with Nathan Nutter winning at 29:11.96, followed by 
Jason Balkman at 29:12.91 and Brent Hauser at 29:14.07. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh's Trecia Smith, the 1997 long jump champion and 1998  
triple jump winner, earned her second outdoor long jump title, 
leaping 21 feet, 8 1/4 inches. Freshman Gabor Mate from Hungary became 
Auburn's first men's throwing champion since 1951, winning the 
discus at 202-1, and SMU sophomore Florence Ezeh took the women's 
hammer throw at 207-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee's Tom Pappas, the collegiate record-holder in the  
decathlon, led after the first five events with 4,265 points -- 78 
ahead of runner-up Attila Zsivoczky of Kansas State. Pappas 
finished first in the shot put at 50-5 1/2 and in the high jump at 
7-0 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The final five events -- the 110 hurdles, discus, pole vault,  
javelin and 1,500 meters -- will be contested Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Marshall and Bates were puzzled as to how they misconnected  
on the handoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt it (the baton),'' said the disheartened and tearful  
Marshall, running the second leg for the first time this year. ``It 
just brushed my hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very disappointed. It's my only event. We've just got to  
put this behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Bates, ``I have no idea why it happened. I just couldn't  
believe it. I didn't think we would come out here and drop it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford's unprecedented sweep of the first three places in the  
10,000 for the second straight year capped a tactical race. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's Abdi Abdirahman set most of the pace for the first  
9,800 meters, with the Stanford trio hanging in close pursuit. 
Then, with about 200 meters left, the three Cardinal runners surged 
to the front, and Nutter, third last year, outkicked his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Balkman, the newcomer in the group, also outran Hauser to the  
tape. Hauser had finished second last year to his brother Brad. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just hanging off the pace ...'' Nutter said. ``That was  
the plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, winning her seventh NCAA title indoors and outdoors, will  
try to repeat as triple jump champion Friday and will compete in 
the heptathlon Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my last year, so I'm trying to do everything I can before  
I go out,'' the senior said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-6 Mate missed his season's best by only six inches in  
winning for the seventh time in eight meets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the happiest man in the world,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ezeh couldn't stay around long enough to get her medal because  
she had to quickly return to Dallas for a final exam in 
organizational behavior on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm crying because I want to stay and support my teammates and  
say, `Go Mustangs!''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her teammates supported her loudly during the competition Bronco  
Stadium at Boise State, and she was anxious to return the favor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team support, I loved it,'' said Ezeh, the 1997 French  
junior champion and national record-holder. 
</P>
<P>
	Ezeh nearly gave up the hammer throw last year after a  
discouraging 14th place in the European Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I went home, I started to think, `What am I going to  
do?''' she said. ``Everyone was waiting for me. I thought about the 
hammer throw and I thought about life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I decided I wanted to be good. I had gone down ... touched the  
bottom. Now, I would go up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the 400 relay semifinals proved disastrous for LSU's  
women, they also were dreadful for defending men's champion TCU. 
The Horned Frogs finished fifth in their heat and failed to qualify 
for Friday's final. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida freshman John Capel, the fastest American this year in  
the men's 200 at 19.99 in winning the Southeastern Conference 
title, won his preliminary heat at 20.71 in advancing to Friday's 
semifinals. Auburn's Coby Miller, the runner-up to Capel in the SEC 
championships, had the fastest prelim time, 20.39.

<HEADLINE> Miller Takes His Shots at Ewing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- About an hour after Reggie Miller hit the  
two free throws that won Game 2, he sat at the podium for his news 
conference and spotted Patrick Ewing entering in the room. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as you make the last (shot), that's all that  
matters,'' Miller said. ``Right, Pat?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jab was too easy for Miller to resist, coming after Ewing's  
last-gasp jumper hit the back of the rim. 
</P>
<P>
	After restraining himself for more than a week and not saying  
anything even remotely controversial, Miller struck with his first 
dig. And the remark figures to only fuel the animosity that makes 
the Pacers-Knicks rivalry such a great one. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a war,'' Ewing said.  
</P>
<P>
	Both teams took the day off Wednesday since the series, tied  
1-1, will not resume until Saturday at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, the hostility will shift the other way -- most of it  
aimed squarely at the No. 1 Knick killer of the decade, Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	At Market Square Arena, the Knicks had to put up with taunting  
Indiana fans. Some of them behind the New York bench unleashed a 
stream of insults. Others showered the players with beer and hurled 
coins as they left the court. 
</P>
<P>
	During the game, the jeering of Ewing became so intense that he  
waved his arms in an emphatic ``bring it on'' gesture completely 
out of character for the 14-year veteran. At another point, Ewing 
mixed it up in a friendly manner with four Pacers fans sitting 
alongside the players' seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't like me here,'' Ewing said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ewing's animated Rileyesque gesture, coming as it did when the  
Knicks were falling behind by 17 points, was somehow indicative of 
the confidence he and his team are playing with this postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	A month and a half ago, a 17-point deficit would have spelled  
certain doom for a team struggling to incorporate so many new 
additions and uncertain if it would make the playoffs -- or whether 
its coach would survive to see another day on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, however, there is a fearlessness and cockiness to  
the Knicks that has surprised the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won, and it was not a pretty win, but a win is a win,''  
Antonio Davis said. ``New York will not go away. We must get ready 
to get in their house and go to work. We're looking forward to 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most irritating to both teams was the way Game 2 was officiated  
by the veteran crew of Dick Bavetta, Hue Hollins and Joe Forte. New 
York was whistled for 40 fouls, including five on its point guards 
in the first nine minutes of the game. Miller hit the winning free 
throws with 2 seconds left after Chris Childs was whistled for his 
sixth foul. 
</P>
<P>
	``We let the officiating overwhelm us at first,'' Allan Houston  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana's Rik Smits was limited to 13 minutes because of foul  
trouble, with a couple of the calls that went against him among the 
most questionable of the night. 
</P>
<P>
	After Miller made his free throws, New York had one last chance.  
Charlie Ward, a former Heisman-winning quarterback at Florida 
State, whipped a court-length pass to Ewing near the opposing free 
throw line. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing wheeled and tossed up a high-arching shot that caromed off  
the rim. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good look -- just missed,'' said coach Jeff Van Gundy,  
who contained himself when asked to comment on the officiating. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Johnson, Childs and Chris Dudley fouled out, Kurt Thomas,  
Ewing and Ward had four apiece and Marcus Camby had five -- the last 
of which was a blocking foul with 31 seconds left that the Knicks 
strongly felt should have gone the other way. 
</P>
<P>
	``When your best players are sitting next to you,'' Van Gundy  
said, ``it's not a great feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Childs: ``We took their best shot, and I'm pretty sure  
there's going to be more shots taken, but I'm telling you, this is 
a special, special group of guys. We have so much fight and 
determination in us. We're going to play to the end.''

<HEADLINE> National Spelling Bee Under Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was a nerve-wracking day of spelling for  
Jason Espiritu, one of 104 young people who advanced to the final 
competition today of this year's national spelling bee. 
</P>
<P>
	First he faced the word ``verisimilitude,'' a noun meaning  
something that appears real. It has seven -- count them, seven -- 
vowels. Then the judges accidentally sounded the elimination bell 
when he correctly spelled ``operatable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It really shook me. They rang the bell, but it was right,''  
said Jason, a 13-year-old speller from Tamuning, Guam. 
</P>
<P>
	His third word on Wednesday was ``encaustic,'' a paint mixed  
with beeswax. That one stumped him for four minutes, two seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Could you say it slowly?'' he asked official pronouncer Alex  
Cameron, who finally got up, walked to the middle of the stage and 
pronounced the word just inches from Jason's face. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a noun?'' Jason asked.  
</P>
<P>
	He was stalling. He knew he was testing the judges' patience so  
he gave it a shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``E-n-c-a-u-s-t-i-c,'' he said. He waited for the bell to ring.  
When it didn't, Jason thrust both arms in the air in victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The 72nd annual Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee began with  
249 spellers. After the first day of competition Wednesday, 104 
spellers were still in the running for the $10,000 first-place cash 
prize. The winner also gets encyclopedias, two airline tickets and 
computer software. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the 9- to 15-year-old contestants, all wearing white  
polo shirts, spelled with their hands stuffed deep in their 
pockets. Others gazed at the ceiling for inspiration. When they sat 
waiting their turn to spell, they yawned, examined the bottoms of 
their tennis shoes, twirled hair and fidgeted with yellow numbered 
placards hung around their necks. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyle Trujillo, one of two 9-year-olds in the contest and,  
ironically, from Tuba City, Ariz., missed ``sousaphone.'' He 
spelled it ``suziphone.'' Michael Bogobowicz, 13, of Naples, Fla., 
was tripped up by the double ``m'' in the word ``megohmmeter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Dechert, 11, of Rock Island, Ill., had trouble with the  
pronunciation of the word ``bildungsroman,'' a German literary 
term. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you repeat that please?'' he asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hope,'' the pronouncer said.  
</P>
<P>
	When he misspelled it, Michael threw his head back and slumped  
slowly off the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashley White, 13, of Washington, D.C., breathed hard, held her  
stomach and then her head before she successfully spelled 
``lycanthrope,'' a word meaning werewolf. Three spellers later, 
Ashley was still holding her head in her hands. 
</P>
<P>
	She got her second word right too, but then misspelled  
``ecclesiastical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was my time to get out. I thought I was going to  
faint,'' Ashley said after the day's competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents were nervous too.  
</P>
<P>
	During a break in the competition, Cathy Saylor of Hillsborough,  
N.C., hurriedly snapped a photograph of her 11-year-old daughter, 
Frances Taschuk, and gave her a hug. ``She said she's nervous. How 
could you not be?'' Ms. Saylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Scripps Howard, the Cincinnati, Ohio-based  
newspaper group that coordinates the national finals, announced 
that Jamaica, home of the 1998 champ, will return to the 
competition next year. Spellers from Jamaica were banned this year 
because a local qualifying contest was held too early. The 
contestant from Jamaica will be sponsored next year by The Gleaner, 
a daily newspaper in Kingston, Jamaica.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Names Air Force Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Wednesday he would  
nominate F. Whitten Peters to be secretary of the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
	Peters, the current acting secretary, was named under secretary  
in November 1997. The Air Force's top civilian job has been vacant 
since Sheila Widnall resigned in October 1997 to return to teaching 
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's original choice for the post, attorney  
Charles Curtis, a former Energy Department official, withdrew his 
name in April over concern that his confirmation would focus on the 
issue of lax security at the nation's nuclear weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	The secretary of the Air Force oversees all matters affecting  
its 380,000 active duty and 115,000 civilian personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Peters previously served as the Defense Department's principal  
general counsel. Before moving to the Pentagon, he was a partner at 
the Washington law firm of Williams &AMP; Connolly. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1976 graduate of Harvard Law School, Peters was president of  
the Harvard Law Review before clerking for the U.S. Court of 
Appeals in the District of Columbia and Justice William Brennan on 
the U.S. Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> Public Interest in Environment Wanes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Americans discouraged by the difficulty of solving  
Earth's environmental problems are beginning to lose interest in 
the issue, according to researchers who reviewed public opinion 
surveys. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you keep telling people that global warming is dangerous,  
they're just going to get frustrated,'' said John Immerwahr, an 
administrator at Villanova University who led the review. 
</P>
<P>
	The nonprofit group Public Agenda carried out the review for the  
American Geophysical Union, which is made up of scientists who 
study the environment. The findings were released in Boston on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, 51 percent of Americans said they worried a great deal  
about damage to the ozone layer, and 35 percent felt the same about 
global warming. In 1997, those numbers dropped to 40 percent and 24 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	More people worry greatly about water pollution than other  
environmental issues -- 61 percent. But even that is down from 72 
percent in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Immerwahr said the declines come not from apathy but from  
frustration with invisible, long-term processes like global 
warming, which is believed to be caused in part by the burning of 
fossil fuels. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's heard about it. Everybody's aware of it. Everybody  
thinks it's a real and bad thing,'' he said. ``Yet they don't know 
what to do about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Immerwahr said many people blame global warming on greed and  
selfishness of consumers and polluters -- a trend they view as 
irreversible. They doubt that nations or their citizens are willing 
to change their behavior or work together on solutions, he said.

<HEADLINE> Injured Indy Crew Member Gets Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Some people get flowers in the hospital.  
Steve Fried probably is the only one with an Indianapolis 500 
rookie of the year trophy at his bedside. 
</P>
<P>
	Fried, the chief mechanic for rookie driver Robby McGehee, was  
critically injured in a freak pit accident during Sunday's race. 
His condition has been upgraded to serious, although it may take 
another few days to determine the extent of his injuries, a team 
spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``A bunch of us were up there yesterday, and Robby presented him  
with the rookie of the year award,'' said Greg Hoover, spokesman 
for Energizer Motorsports. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's conscious and alert. He has the ventilator tube in, so he  
can't talk, but he communicates by spelling out words on his right 
leg with his index finger, as if he were writing them on his leg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's difficult for him to use a pen or pencil and paper because  
of his horizontal position in the bed at Methodist Hospital, Hoover 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fried was working in McGehee's pit early in the race when he was  
struck from behind by Jimmy Kite's car, which had been hit by 
another car whose brakes had failed. Fried landed on his face and 
injured his head and chest. 
</P>
<P>
	McGehee wound up fifth, the best finish among four rookie  
starters, and at the Victory Celebration Monday night he dedicated 
his award to his injured crew chief. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having stood there and seen the whole thing, I've got to tell  
you, I was just amazed how alert he is and responsive,'' Hoover 
said. ``He knows everybody around him, knows what's going on. ... 
His wife, Jennifer, is with him at the hospital. His mother, 
Natalie, flew in from California. 
</P>
<P>
	``But he's doing good. He was kind of giving the doctors a  
little grief yesterday. That's Steve, good old Steve. So we're all 
pretty heartened by that,'' the team spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctors said that because he had an internal brain injury,  
it's sort of a 3- to 5-day evaluation period. They just kind of 
want to see how that comes along, but everything we've heard is 
positive.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Auto Sales Exceed Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Automakers posted one of their strongest U.S.  
sales months ever in May, exceeding the industry's own expectations 
as demand for new cars and light trucks showed no sign of slowing. 
</P>
<P>
	``A record year is within reach,'' Ford Motor Co. marketing  
chief Bob Rewey said Wednesday as the automakers released their 
sales figures for the month. ``May was a blockbuster sales month 
for Ford and the industry -- stronger than we expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	May's year-to-year gains were expected to be muted because of  
the comparison to a particularly robust May 1998, when sales were 
boosted by a discount coupon war between General Motors Corp., Ford 
and what was then Chrysler Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	But a burst of sales over the long Memorial Day weekend helped  
most automakers end the month with impressive gains. Company 
records for any month were set by the Chrysler and Mercedes-Benz 
units of DaimlerChrysler AG, Toyota Motor Corp. and its Lexus 
division, Ford's Jaguar unit and Kia Motors Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of the two or three strongest months ever; maybe the  
strongest month that wasn't influenced by changes in the tax law or 
other artificial stuff,'' said analyst David Healy of Burnham 
Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Industrywide, sales were up about 6 percent excluding Suzuki  
Motor Corp., a small player that planned to report its sales 
Thursday. Sales by European automakers were up 32 percent, Asian 
companies gained 11 percent, while GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler's 
U.S. brands edged up 2.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford posted one of the biggest increases -- up 10 percent  
compared with a year ago. It had a surprising 18 percent increase 
in car sales, excluding its Jaguar and Volvo models. Ford's light 
trucks -- pickups, sport utility vehicles, vans and minivans -- were 
up 6 percent for a May record. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chrysler half of DaimlerChrysler AG was up 6 percent for its  
best month ever, led by an 8 percent increase in truck sales. James 
P. Holden, vice president of marketing and sales, said the 
company's economists keep expecting the market to soften, but so 
far there's no evidence of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market feels mighty strong, and I don't see that  
changing,'' Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM was the biggest disappointment in May's sales contest. Its  
sales were off 5 percent. Despite its hot-selling full-size 
pickups, overall sales of GM's light trucks declined 2 percent; its 
full-size SUVs took the biggest hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``All year long they've been giving away market share to the  
foreign brands while Ford and DaimlerChrysler have held their 
own,'' Healy said. ``May was just another example of that 
intensified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	European automakers once again had the greatest percentage  
gains. Although European companies sell far fewer vehicles in the 
United States than either the domestic or Asian automakers, they 
have been steadily gaining market share over the past two years, 
mostly at the expense of GM. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the Europeans have had double-digit, year-over-year  
percentage gains for the past 20 months. In May, Volkswagen AG 
posted a 56 percent increase for its best May in 20 years; Saab 
Automobile AB, half-owned by GM, more than doubled its sales from a 
year ago; Ford's Volvo Cars unit was up 21 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Asian automakers also did well last month. Honda Motor Co. was  
up 6 percent for its best May, Nissan Motor Corp. posted a 10 
percent gain, and Toyota Motor Corp. was up nearly 5 percent for 
the best U.S. sales month in its 42-year history. Kia doubled its 
May sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford announced Wednesday it would boost its second-quarter  
production by another 20,000 vehicles to a total of 1.282 million 
vehicles -- up 8 percent from the same quarter of 1998. It was 
Ford's third increase since its second-quarter production schedule 
was announced in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's reports came as the industry dodged a potential  
threat to its profits, as the Teamsters union and trucking 
companies that transport new vehicles to dealers reached agreement 
on a new contract and averted a threatened strike.

<HEADLINE> Bristol-Microsoft Trial Set To Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Bristol Technology Inc. likes to  
describe its lawsuit against Microsoft Corp. as a battle of David 
versus Goliath. 
</P>
<P>
	But as a trial opens Thursday in Bristol's antitrust lawsuit  
against Microsoft, both companies will be using the David v. 
Goliath image for all it's worth. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol is a small Danbury-based software maker with just 70  
employees and $8.7 million in revenues. Microsoft, the maker of 
Windows, has 26,000 employees and $14.48 billion in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	At the trial, Bristol will claim Microsoft is using its market  
muscle to improperly withhold a software code Bristol needs to 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, however, will claim that Bristol is playing on its  
status as an underdog to try to win a large financial judgment 
against Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies once worked together amicably. Bristol makes a  
product called Wind/U, which allows programs written specifically 
for Windows to be converted to run on computers with different 
operating systems such as Unix. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Microsoft signed a licensing agreement with Bristol for  
Windows NT 3.0, but that agreement expired in 1997. Bristol filed 
suit after the two companies could not reach a new agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft claims Bristol's lawsuit was meant to force Microsoft  
to agree to more favorable licensing terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been very reasonable and fair,'' said Microsoft  
spokesman Tom Pilla. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before, during and after they sued us, we offered the same  
reasonable terms that would have allowed us to avoid litigation,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the trial, Microsoft plans to introduce a ``strategic  
communications game plan'' developed by a New York public relations 
firm for Bristol. The plan, developed about a month before Bristol 
filed its lawsuit against Microsoft, recommended that Bristol 
position itself as ``David ... a reluctant, yet courageous 
plaintiff defending its small, successful and growing 
entrepreneurial company and Goliath as a predatory, deep-pocketed, 
unethical behemoth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol Chief Executive Keith Blackwell, who founded the company  
in the basement of his home in 1991, does not deny that Bristol 
developed elaborate plans to fight Microsoft. But he says it is 
Microsoft that refused to negotiate reasonable terms for the new 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he believes Microsoft hastily signed a similar licensing  
deal with Mainsoft, one of its competitors, a week after Bristol 
filed its lawsuit, merely so it could use the agreement to defend 
itself against the antitrust claims. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial, to be heard by a 10-member jury in U.S. District  
Court in Bridgeport, is expected to last about six weeks. As one of 
its first bits of testimony, Bristol plans to play parts of a 
videotaped deposition by Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial had been scheduled to start Wednesday, but was  
postponed a day after Judge Janet Hall met with lawyers from both 
companies for several hours Tuesday and said there were procedural 
issues that still needed to be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bristol case begins this week as testimony resumes in a  
larger antitrust case brought by the U.S. Justice Department and 19 
states. In that case, the government contends that Microsoft 
illegally wielded the monopoly power from its dominant Windows 
product to expand into new markets, such as Internet software, and 
thus crush competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera Inc., a small Orem company, also is suing Microsoft for  
alleged antitrust law violations. A jury trial is scheduled for 
January.

<HEADLINE> Passengers Screamed Before Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- With flames closing in and their  
clothes drenched with aviation fuel, terrified passengers aboard 
American Airlines Flight 1420 squeezed through a twisted emergency 
exit and scrambled out gaping holes in the fuselage. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I thought was that I was going to die,'' said passenger  
Bonnie Montgomery. ``Everyone was pushing and pulling to get out of 
that plane. We were on our hands and knees, and the smoke was so 
thick we couldn't breathe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even I pushed a few people, because your natural instinct to  
survive just kicks in,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lightning from a fast-approaching storm had cracked around  
Flight 1420 as it approached Little Rock on Tuesday night. Even the 
voice from the cockpit had a sense of apprehension. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all knew something was going wrong because of all the  
turbulence. I had never flown at night, but with all that wind and 
rain, I was sure we would crash,'' said Ms. Montgomery, who was in 
Row 27. 
</P>
<P>
	``The captain came over the intercom a lot earlier than usual  
and he told us we'd better get our seatbelts on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Passenger Barrett Baber said the plane seemed to be coming in  
landing faster than normal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we were going to be OK. All we knew was that there  
was bad weather,'' Baber said. ``The plane was going so fast, when 
we hit the ground, we went off the end of the runway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers said it seemed the plane's tires never gripped as the  
MD-82, carrying 139 passengers and a crew of six, barreled down 
Runway 4R toward the Arkansas River. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we hit the ground, I thought, `Thank God that we'll be  
safe,''' Ms. Montgomery said. ``Then I looked out of my window and 
all I saw was grass. I prayed that we'd stop, but we kept on 
going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The airplane slid off the 7,200-foot runway, past an access road  
and whipped around a metal tower for beacons that lead southbound 
planes to the Little Rock National Airport. The stanchion acted 
like a can opener, peeling back the plane's thin shell on the left 
side from the captain's controls through the first-class section. 
The fire started behind that point, from fuel spilled as the plane 
broke up. 
</P>
<P>
	``One side of it ripped off like a sardine can,'' Mayor Jim  
Dailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Klamm, 19, of Pine Bluff said he escaped as fire spread  
toward the first-class section where he was sitting. ``All of a 
sudden I saw a big chunk of the plane just fall away,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The jarring collision with the tower broke open other cracks in  
the aircraft -- some just wide enough to allow passengers to slip 
out. But it also knocked the emergency exit nearest Baber out of 
kilter so only one person at a time could escape. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was panic, craziness. There were flames. People were  
screaming, `God, please save us!''' said Baber, who slid his 
6-foot-plus frame out the damaged door. Safety, however, offered 
new misery: He landed in soggy bottomland along an Arkansas River 
backwater where passengers were pelted with golfball-size hail. 
</P>
<P>
	Baber said he and a friend went back to the plane about five  
times to help others get away, including flight attendant Tammy 
Gardner and a man from Hawaii whose leg was cut to the bone. They 
had to stop when the smoke got too bad. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had stayed, I wouldn't be here,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	David Stanley of Warren said he saw only fire.  
</P>
<P>
	``We landed, the plane started skidding, and then flames.  
Flames. I remember flames and flames,'' Stanley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors stood in rain and hail for 2 1/2 hours, with the rain  
sometimes falling at a rate of 7 inches an hour. The airport's wind 
gauge clocked a gust at 87 mph six minutes after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospitals said 83 passengers were injured.  
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't seen anything like it,'' said Mark Washington, a  
security guard at Southwest Hospital. ``They looked shocked and 
dazed. Aviation fuel, I could smell it on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Interviewed at a nearby theater turned into a reunion site for  
survivors and their relatives and friends, Baber recalled leaving a 
message with a friend in case he didn't return from his trip to 
Germany with other members of the Ouachita Singers from Ouachita 
Baptist University at Arkadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The day before I left -- it was a stupid thing -- I told a  
friend, `If anything happens to me, tell all my friends that I told 
you this, and tell them that I love them, and tell my parents that 
I love them,''' Baber said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought about it and, think, this was the last flight  
of the trip.''

<HEADLINE> Bill Gates Makes Charity Donation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Bill and Melinda Gates have made another  
multibillion-dollar donation to charity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Microsoft founder and his wife gave $5 billion to one of  
their philanthropic foundations. In announcing the gift Wednesday, 
the Gates family foundation said it, in turn, had given $50 million 
to the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health to help find a 
vaccine for malaria. 
</P>
<P>
	The $5 billion gift of Microsoft Corp. stock to the William H.  
Gates Foundation gives it an asset base of $10 billion. A second 
family charitable organization, the Gates Learning Foundation, has 
assets of $1.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates, the richest man in the United States, and his wife are  
estimated to be worth more than $80 billion. The latest gift 
follows a $3 billion donation by the Gateses to their foundation in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple plans to eventually turn over more of their riches to  
their foundations, said Trevor Nielsen, spokesman for the learning 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their schedule of giving is aggressive now and will become  
even more aggressive in the future,'' he said. ``They have said in 
the past that their plan is to give away most of their wealth.''

<HEADLINE> 'Irascible' Opens Spelling Bee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Harry Altman's first word in this year's  
national spelling bee made him and the other young contestants 
chuckle. The definition: a pain in the head. 
</P>
<P>
	``C-e-p-h-a-l-a-l-g-i-a,'' Harry said, slowly emphasizing each  
letter. 
</P>
<P>
	The elimination bell didn't ding. He had spelled it correctly.  
The boy smiled timidly and ambled back to his chair on the stage of 
a hotel ballroom here. The 12-year-old sixth-grader from Glen Rock, 
N.J., still had a chance to be this year's champ. 
</P>
<P>
	The 72nd Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee began today with  
``irascible,'' a word that means marked by a hot temper or 
resentful anger. Mark Albers, 12, of Reno, Nev., misspelled it with 
a double ``r.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bell signaling a misspelled word rang. He was out.  
</P>
<P>
	The bee began with 249 spellers. Among the half who competed  
during the morning, 33 were eliminated in the first round, 
including Shante Lewis, 9, a fourth-grader from Plainfield, N.J., 
who was the youngest contestant this year. Another 10 misspelled 
words in the second round and 36 were eliminated in the third 
round. The remaining half of spellers were scheduled to compete in 
rounds one through three later today with the finals scheduled 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Joanna Mann, 13, of San Angelo, Texas, missed her first word --  
``phugoid.'' She didn't know what it meant, either. The dictionary 
says the word represents variations in the longitudinal motion or 
course of the center of mass of an airplane in flight. Joanna 
misspelled it ``fugoid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I got nervous and said 'f' by accident,'' Joanna said during a  
break. ``I was really nervous on stage. Now I'm calmed down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spelling bee got off to a swift start. A new policy this  
year encourages the 249 young spellers to spell a little faster 
than in past competitions. Judges this year have been given more 
guidance in disqualifying contestants who spell as slow as 
m-o-l-a-s-s-e-s. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very easy to lose track of time,'' said director Paige  
Kimble. ``We examined time and round statistics for the last six 
years and found that spellers on average were spending longer at 
the microphone. And we could not reasonably continue that trend 
without extending the length of the bee itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not an ironclad time limit, but if a speller pauses long  
enough, judges can request an immediate response, and then 
disqualify a speller who fails to give it. Under the guidelines, 
adequate times to spell words are 90 seconds for easier words from 
the first day and two minutes for the harder words in the final 
rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	While few children take longer than a minute to spell a word,  
some contestants take four or five. One year, a speller left the 
judges and audience hanging for nine minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can sort of understand why you can't just have somebody just  
standing up there on stage,'' said Kyra Davies, 13, an eighth-grade 
speller from Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's contestants all have won regional bees to qualify. Those  
who pass the first few rounds today will compete for the 
championship Thursday. The winner will receive $10,000, a choice of 
encyclopedias and other prizes. Each contestant will receive a 
commemorative watch from Scripps Howard and a cash prize determined 
by rank. 
</P>
<P>
	Spellers from Jamaica, home of the reigning champ, were banned  
this year because all qualifying contests must have been held no 
earlier than this Feb. 1. Last year, Jamaica continued its 
four-decade-old tradition of qualifying its spellers in August. The 
new rule grew out of concern that some spellers were getting as 
much as a six-month head start on other children, Ms. Kimble said.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'The King of Masks' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Many foreign-language films have had worldwide success in recent  
years due largely to their focus on children who shine. Among them: 
Italy's ``Life Is Beautiful,'' Brazil's ``Central Station'' and 
Iran's ``Children of Heaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese director Wu Tianming's ``The King of Masks,'' draws its  
charm from the same source. It tells the moving story of the 
relationship between an aging magician and a street-smart child in 
a poor town in China during the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	The film is sweet and uplifting, contemplative and  
philosophical. What could have been a sappy story becomes an 
endearing tearjerker, largely through the honest performance of its 
young co-star. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang (Zhu Xu) is a master of the ancient art of mask-changing.  
He dazzles cheering crowds with his sleight of hand and colorful, 
exquisitely detailed masks. He wants to pass along his skill before 
he dies, but only to a boy. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Sichuan provinces, women are second-class citizens and  
young girls are bought and sold on the black market to help 
families survive. Wang knows purchasing a healthy young boy will be 
difficult, until he meets Doggie (Zhou Ren-Ying), an energetic and 
affectionate 7-year-old who cries out ``Grandpa'' and melts his 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
	They bond quickly, living a simple, quiet life on the riverbank  
on Wang's rattan boat. Doggie has been sold seven times before, and 
repeated beatings have made him grow up quickly. Wang's wife left 
him 30 years before, and his son died young. Each finally has found 
in the other a much-needed friend and companion. 
</P>
<P>
	Their euphoria shatters after a few weeks, though, when Wang  
learns Doggie's secret -- he's actually a girl, pretending to be a 
boy to find a home. Stunned and feeling foolish, he rejects the 
child on the riverbank. ``So young and yet such a crook,'' Wang 
laments. With tears streaming down her beautiful face, Doggie begs 
Wang not to leave her, promises to cook and clean. Her shrill cries 
are haunting. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang takes her back as an apprentice, but forces her to call him  
``Boss'' and incorporates her into his act as an acrobat. Later she 
must save his life, challenging Wang's long-held ideas about women. 
</P>
<P>
	Too many child actors these days -- especially American ones --  
have a propensity to be precocious, to deliver each line with a 
knowing wink. Zhou is refreshingly real, perhaps because of her own 
experiences growing up poor. Wu said that was one reason why he 
chose her from more than 100 children who auditioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Screenwriter Wei Minglung has created in Doggie a lovable and  
complex character. She has been abused and abandoned all her short 
life, yet she has unconditional love for the old man who has taken 
her in and compassion for a young village boy who has been 
kidnapped. Zhou makes her a joy to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	As Wang, Zhu gives an equally compelling performance. His face  
is as expressive as the masks he wears, and he adeptly shows Wang's 
many sides -- unstoppable showman, doting grandfather, ordinary man 
coming to terms with his mortality. 
</P>
<P>
	The film's texture reflects the characters' moods. It often has  
an eerie, dreamlike quality, with its quiet moments and fog-covered 
seascapes. Other times it snaps to life with fireworks, parades, 
brightly colored costumes and loud music. 
</P>
<P>
	``The King of Masks'' is Wu's first film after eight years in  
exile in the United States, and it was worth the wait. It has 
received awards from festivals around the world, including San 
Francisco, Australia, Tokyo, Paris, Moscow, Istanbul and China. 
</P>
<P>
	``The King of Masks,'' a Samuel Goldwyn Films release, runs 101  
minutes. It is in Mandarin with English subtitles and it is not 
rated.

	9 Die in Ark. Plane Crash Landing  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A coroner has confirmed that nine  
people were killed when an American Airlines jetliner skidded off a 
runway while landing during a storm last night. The deaths are the 
first on a major U.S. airline in nearly 1 1/2 years. The dead were not 
immediately identified, except for Flight 1420's pilot, Capt. 
Richard Buschmann, the airline's chief pilot in Chicago. The jet 
was headed to Arkansas from Dallas and crashed amid rough weather 
at the Little Rock airport just before midnight. More than 80 
others on board were treated for injuries at hospitals. There were 
also about 50 others who didn't require treatment.

	U.S. Seeks Normal Trade With China  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to extend normal trade  
relations with China for another year, White House officials said 
today, despite opposition from Congress. The annual recommendation 
for ``most-favored nation'' status comes at a time when allegations 
that China stole sensitive nuclear secrets from U.S. research 
facilities and NATO's mistaken bombing of the Chinese Embassy in 
Belgrade have strained U.S. relations with Beijing. But aides say 
Clinton is convinced that continued engagement with China is key to 
improving relations.

	U.S. To Review Kosovo Options  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will meet with U.S. military  
leaders tomorrow to assess the conflict in Yugoslavia, including 
the possibility of using ground troops to battle Serb forces. 
Defense Secretary William Cohen said there are currently no plans 
to use troops as anything other than peacekeepers, but the leaders 
will discuss a range of issues including whether ground force is an 
option. Clinton, meanwhile, said that the United States would 
contribute 7,000 of the approximately 50,000 troops that would form 
a peacekeeping force for Kosovo once the Serbs agree to NATO's 
demands for an end to the fighting.

	Killing Halts Paris Transportation

<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- A strike by transport workers angry about the  
killing of a co-worker paralyzed public transportation in Paris and 
its suburbs today. The deadly attack against Eric Douet was only 
the latest in a rising number of assaults against French transport 
workers. Douet was beaten to death by a peddler he had confronted. 
The government responded to the rising violence by deploying police 
on trains and buses, but the transport union said the measures 
weren't enough. Meanwhile, thousands of French commuters walked 
through the muggy weather to work.

	World Bank Estimates 200M New Poor

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The World Bank in its annual update on global  
poverty estimates there are millions of ``newly poor'' people, and 
recommends urgent changes in financial rescue programs. The bank 
said programs, including unemployment insurance and subsidized 
school fees, are needed to avoid and deal with financial crises. 
The bank responded to data showing poverty rising again in India, 
continuing to go up in Africa and sharply worsening across Eastern 
Europe and Central Asia. The bank said the number of people 
classified as living in abject poverty rose 200 million in 1993 to 
1.5 billion.

	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- A tractor-trailer loaded with 20 tons of  
explosive firework powder overturned at a major highway interchange 
early today, prompting the evacuation of dozens of homes and 
clogging rush-hour traffic in the Washington area. The flatbed 
truck ran off a ramp at the interchange of I-495, I-395 and I-95, 
the major north-south highway linking New York and Florida. The 
explosive powder, the type used to make fireworks, was inside a

	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Knicks center Patrick Ewing will miss  
the rest of the playoffs because of a partially torn Achilles' 
tendon. Ewing underwent tests this morning that confirmed the 
injury, just hours after he missed a potential tying shot at the 
buzzer in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals against the 
Pacers in Indianapolis. The 36-year-old center will be in a cast 
for six weeks. The 14-year veteran has been slowed all season by 
his sore Achilles, and also has struggled with sore knees.

<HEADLINE> Foreman Seeks Bout Against Tyson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The heavyweight fight picture grew more clouded  
Wednesday amid talk of a George Foreman-Mike Tyson fight and new 
trouble in arranging the title rematch between Evander Holyfield 
and Lennox Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	A Foreman adviser said he was trying to put together a  
Foreman-Tyson fight for December that would match the two former 
heavyweight champions in a bout that would pay Tyson $25 million 
and Foreman $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the rematch of the first controversial fight between  
Holyfield and Lewis was in jeopardy despite promoter Don King's 
announcement last week that the fight would be held in November at 
a Las Vegas casino. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no deal,'' HBO vice president Lou DiBella said.  
``There are some problematic issues that need to be worked out. 
We're hopeful we can work them out, but they haven't been resolved 
yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Lewis and his promoter sent a letter to Park Place  
Entertainment on Wednesday telling the casino operator to stop 
giving the public ``a false impression that the fight is made, 
which is consistent with the current state of facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Lewis and Holyfield have both agreed to $15 million  
paydays for the proposed November fight and Park Place has signed a 
deal with King to hold it at one of its Las Vegas casinos, no 
contracts for the fight have actually been signed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certainly concerned,'' Holyfield's attorney, Jim Thomas,  
said. ``Evander wants this fight to happen very badly and so, we 
think, does Lennox.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The main issue to be resolved is HBO's insistence that King step  
aside as the fight promoter if he were to be indicted on charges 
stemming from a number of ongoing investigations into boxing, 
sources close to the negotiations, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, told The Associated Press. King, so far, has refused 
such a clause in the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've settled basically on the money,'' said Lewis attorney  
Milton Chwasky. ``There's only one hindrance to this. It's Don's 
thing with HBO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Lewis-Holyfield rematch for the undisputed title is  
not a done deal, longtime Foreman adviser Ron Weathers and light 
heavyweight champion Roy Jones Jr. were trying to put together a 
deal for Foreman and Tyson to meet in December in a pay-per-view 
spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Showtime network, which shows Tyson's fights,  
said they were interested and Tyson adviser Shelly Finkel did not 
discount the possibility of a matchup between the two former 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good story more than reality right now,'' Finkel said.  
``I've told them to have Foreman call me personally so we would 
know if he really wants to fight. So far he hasn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, released last month from a Maryland jail, has been  
running and doing conditioning exercises since then while Finkel 
and others try to put together a deal for his first return fight. 
</P>
<P>
	That would most likely be in September on Showtime, but not on  
pay-per-view, against the likes of Denmark's Brian Nielsen or 
Germany's Axel Schulz. 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes well in that fight, Tyson would fight in a  
pay-per-view bout in December. And his opponent could possibly be 
Foreman. 
</P>
<P>
	``From both of their standpoints, where else would they get this  
kind of money,'' said Fred Levin, who is Jones' lawyer and would 
co-promote the bout with the light heavyweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike has got problems now and it would be George's swan song.  
People wouldn't buy Larry Holmes and George Foreman, but they will 
buy Mike Tyson and George Foreman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman would be 51 at the time of the fight, which would  
fulfill a goal he had when he came out of retirement 13 years ago 
to fight Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always been his one goal in life to fight Mike Tyson,''  
Weathers said. ``It would be a great show with two guys who are 
huge punchers. Mike Tyson didn't want this fight for a long time, 
but I'm told he does now.''

<HEADLINE> Jury Ruling Favors Tobacco Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELLISVILLE, Miss. (AP) -- The widow of a barber killed by cancer  
after decades of breathing the smoke exhaled by his customers is 
not entitled to damages from the tobacco industry, a jury ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he'd be surprised (by the verdict),'' Ava Dean  
Butler said Wednesday of her late husband, Burl. ``But he would be 
pleased about the public awareness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 62-year-old widow sued cigarette makers, claiming secondhand  
smoke killed her husband in 1994 at age 60. The jury deliberated 
about two hours Wednesday before rejecting the $650 million claim. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco lawyers argued that Butler had a family history of  
cancer, and that he had been exposed to asbestos in talcum power 
and methylene chloride in hair spray used in his shop. 
</P>
<P>
	``We bought the jury every piece of evidence we could find that  
would help them decide the case,'' said Philip Morris Tobacco Co. 
lawyer Bill Ohlemeyer. ``All of it indicated that Mr. Butler's 
cancer was caused by something other than environmental tobacco 
smoke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A previous class-action lawsuit brought by thousands of Florida  
flight attendants who claimed that working on smoky airplanes made 
them sick was settled during trial for $349 million in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	An Indiana jury in 1998 found the tobacco industry not liable  
for the death of a nonsmoking nurse. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Butler said she intends to go to schools, churches and  
other public places to inform anyone who will listen about the 
dangers of secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to make as many people as possible know that it will  
kill you,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other defendants in the case were R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,  
Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., Lorillard, Liggett Group and the 
former American Tobacco Co.

<HEADLINE> Transplants Cure Cases of Blindness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	People blinded by fire, chemical burns or illness could have  
enough of their sight restored to do daily chores -- maybe even 
drive -- through innovative transplant surgery that uses special 
tissue-making cells, researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure, pioneered a decade ago and refined since then,  
would not help people who were born blind or lost their sight 
because of nerve or retina damage. It is only for patients who are 
legally blind but can still sense light. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese researchers restored sight to half of the eyes on which  
they performed surgery, though some needed as many as four 
operations. Their work, the first long-term study of the procedure, 
was reported in today's New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39 patients had become legally blind in one or both eyes,  
meaning they could, at best, count fingers held up in front of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best patient recovered from a finger count to almost  
20/20'' and was able to drive again, said Dr. Kazuo Tsubota, 
chairman of ophthalmology at Tokyo Dental College, where students 
also study medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The patients' blindness was caused by heat or chemical burns,  
blistering from a severe reaction to medication or an eye-attacking 
immune disorder that afflicts the elderly. Tens of thousands of 
Americans are legally blind for these reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's so many people out there that don't know they can be  
helped,'' said Dr. Edward Holland, director of the Cornea Service 
in the Department of Ophthalmology at the University of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	After a Harvard researcher 10 years ago successfully  
transplanted the special cells from a patient's healthy eye to a 
damaged one, scientists tried the same procedure using eye tissue 
from cadavers, refining the approach as they gained experience. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1992 through 1996, the Japanese doctors did 70 transplant  
operations on 43 eyes in 39 patients. Surgeons removed the damaged 
eye surface, then sewed on tissue from an eye bank, a new cornea, 
if necessary, and tissue called the limbus that rings the cornea. 
</P>
<P>
	The limbus contains stem cells, ``factories'' that produce  
various types of cells -- in this case, the epithelial cells that 
cover the eyeball. Normally the body replaces epithelial cells 
every few months as they slough off like skin. 
</P>
<P>
	Because illness or injury had killed the stem cells of these  
patients, when their epithelium wore away, scar tissue formed over 
the cornea, destroying vision. Thus a cornea transplant would have 
failed within a few months. 
</P>
<P>
	With this procedure, the patients get a new epithelium factory.  
</P>
<P>
	After an average of 39 months, the transplanted tissue was still  
generating epithelium in 51 percent of the patients. Their vision 
improved, on average, from only being able to distinguish motion or 
count fingers to being able to read the top letter on an eye chart, 
without eyeglasses, from about 3 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though the success rate at first glance doesn't seem that  
high, you're comparing it with zero,'' Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holland, who co-wrote an editorial accompanying the study, has  
done about 60 such operations with a similar success rate. He said 
the study shows how two key improvements are increasing doctors' 
success: transplanting more limbus tissue so patients get more stem 
cells and giving patients immune-suppressing drugs to prevent 
transplant rejection. 
</P>
<P>
	Tsubota's team is working on other refinements. Those include  
determining the optimal dosage and duration for the 
immune-suppressing medications; making special eye drops from the 
patient's own tears to provide key proteins and combat the dry eyes 
common with such injuries; and putting the donor stem cells in 
nutrients so they multiply and yield more stem cells for 
transplant.

<HEADLINE> Drug Helps Bone Marrow Transplants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A new immune-suppressing drug may allow cancer  
victims to receive bone marrow transplants from poorly matched 
donors without life-threatening complications. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug suppresses only the part of the immune system that  
causes these complications. Doctors say this could allow patients 
to receive marrow transplants without needing drugs that broadly 
suppress the body's immune defenses -- drugs that raise the risk of 
infections and other health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In today's New England Journal of Medicine, researchers reported  
that the approach worked surprisingly well in the first 
experimental use on terminally ill cancer patients. They predicted 
it may also make it easier to transplant hearts, kidneys and other 
organs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is starting to crack open the door on a new way of  
manipulating the immune system,'' said Dr. Eva Guinan of Boston's 
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, where the approach was developed and 
tested. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the treatment could make more transplants possible by  
eliminating the need for near-perfect matches between donors and 
recipients, and it could make transplants safer by potentially 
making lifelong immune suppression drugs unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Bone marrow manufactures new blood cells and sometimes must be  
replaced in leukemia and other marrow cancers. To minimize 
complications, doctors seek a close genetic match between donor and 
recipient. 
</P>
<P>
	The new treatment, called CTLA4-Ig, blocks development of a  
dangerous complication called graft vs. host disease, which occurs 
when foreign tissue is placed in the body. The drug stops only the 
category of white blood cells that promote this response, leaving 
intact the rest of the immune function of the newly transferred 
marrow. Doctors treat the donated marrow with CTLA4-Ig outside the 
body before transplanting it. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors tested the new approach on 12 young victims of advanced  
leukemia for whom only poorly matched marrow was available. No 
severe graft vs. host disease occurred. Five have survived for five 
to 29 months, while the rest died of treatment complications and 
cancer relapse. 
</P>
<P>
	All would have died without marrow transplants, the doctors  
said, and ordinary transplants would have been expected to cause 
serious graft vs. host disease in most or all patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the step to the next century,'' said Dr. Lee Nadler of  
Dana-Farber. ``This is the first specific immune suppression that 
has every been done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Journal deputy editor Robert Schwartz, who helped pioneer immune  
suppression for organ transplants in the 1950s, called the results 
impressive. However, in an editorial, he cautioned that this ``must 
be balanced against the small number of patients, the high death 
rate and the lack of information about immunologic reconstitution 
in the survivors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guinan said the approach may also be widely used for those who  
need marrow transplants for other reasons, such as curing the blood 
diseases sickle cell anemia and thalassemia. 
</P>
<P>
	CTLA4-Ig is being developed commercially by Repligen Corp. of  
Needham, Mass. It plans to sponsor a larger study by the end of the 
year.

<HEADLINE>  Baseball Wants Umps To Avoid TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball wants umpires to limit television to  
their private lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpire Frank Pulli's decision to view a videotape replay and  
change a home run to a double in Florida's 5-2 loss to St. Louis 
was wrong, NL president Len Coleman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Use of the video replay is not an acceptable practice,''  
Coleman said. ``Part of the beauty of baseball is that it is 
imperfect. Players make errors. Managers are constantly 
second-guessed. But the game is played and determined by two teams 
between the white lines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball, the NBA, NCAA football and soccer do not allow  
officials to use replays, while the NHL permits it to determine 
goals and NCAA basketball allows it in a few specific instances. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL had replay from 1986-91 and reinstated it on a limited  
basis last March after several game-turning calls that replays 
showed were incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
	``Traditionally, baseball has relied on the eyes of the umpires  
as opposed to any artificial devices for its judgments,'' Coleman 
said. ``I fully support this policy. Occasionally, however, the 
umpires too will make mistakes; that is also part of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cliff Floyd claimed his drive Monday was a homer because it  
bounced off the facade behind the left-field scoreboard in Miami. 
Second-base umpire Greg Gibson thought the ball hit off the 
scoreboard and called it a double, but after the Marlins argued, 
the umpires conferred and Pulli -- the crew chief and third-base ump 
-- changed the ruling to a homer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals then protested, and the game was delayed for more  
than five minutes while Pulli studied replays on a TV camera near 
the Marlins' dugout. After consulting the replay, Pulli changed the 
call back to a double. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman said Pulli, who with 28 years is second in seniority  
among NL umpires, was ``acting in good faith,'' but made a mistake. 
Coleman did not rule on Florida's written protest. Because the 
Marlins would have gained only one more run if the play had been 
ruled a homer, it's unlikely the protest will be upheld. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd, speaking in Miami before Tuesday night's game, agreed  
with Coleman's decision. He said allowing replays would lead to 
more arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	``You set yourself up for it to happen again, and you're going  
to have tons of people thrown out of the game. They'll be arguing 
until they're green in the face,'' Floyd said. ``Most guys make 
history by hitting two grand slams in a game or something. I make 
history by hitting a ball that's reviewed on instant replay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Bottenfield, the winning pitcher in the game, also thought  
replays were inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never cared for it in football,'' he said. ``I'm kind of  
a traditionalist, and I'd rather not see it in baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida manager John Boles said his team found ``a document that  
came out in the late '80s from the commissioner's office that 
explicitly says video is not to be used when determining a call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AL president Gene Budig took a similar stance. ``Major league  
games are determined between the lines, and electronic assistance 
is not permitted,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Bud Selig also backed the decision, saying he was  
very concerned about the ``pace of the game,'' but didn't want to 
talk extensively so as not to offend umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	The players association said its position is still being  
determined. 
</P>
<P>
	``The players, while not supportive of an extensive use of  
replay, are not opposed to it for the purposes of determining home 
runs, foul or fair, above or below the line,'' said Gene Orza, the 
union's No. 2 official. ``But this is based only on conversations 
with a few players, and we'll have to seek a broader consensus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate reaction from the Major League Umpires  
Association. Pulli declined comment after Coleman issued his 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of things went through my mind,'' he said Monday night.  
``I hope I don't have to go to the replay again. I don't want it to 
become like football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the NFL, replays will now be limited to out-of-bounds, goal  
line and possession calls and is based on a coaches' challenge 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's intended for the crucial, game-deciding play, not the  
third-and-10 in the first quarter,'' NFL commissioner Paul 
Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1997, soccer's International Board rejected the use of  
replays by officials, an idea proposed by Germany and Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are anxious television doesn't take over the game by  
controlling the referee,'' said Sepp Blatter, then FIFA's general 
secretary and now its president. ``Football is composed of human 
beings, human frailties, mistakes and errors. We have to live with 
that.''

<HEADLINE>  SMU's Ezeh Wins NCAA Hammer Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- SMU sophomore Florence Ezeh became the first  
winner in the NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships on 
Wednesday, and couldn't stay around long enough to get her medal. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning the women's hammer throw at 207 feet, 2 inches,  
Ezeh had to quickly return to Dallas for a final exam in 
organizational behavior on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm crying because I want to stay and support my teammates and  
say, `Go Mustangs!''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her teammates supported her loudly during the competition at  
rain-soaked Bronco Stadium at Boise State, and she was anxious to 
return the favor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team support, I loved it,'' said Ezeh, the 1997 French  
junior champion and national record-holder. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Ezeh's biggest concerns Wednesday was getting to the  
track on time. In last year's NCAA Championships at Buffalo, N.Y., 
she arrived late after her coach got lost and took 90 minutes for a 
drive that should have been much shorter. 
</P>
<P>
	That unnerved Ezeh and her best throw was only 186-6, just 15th  
place. 
</P>
<P>
	``I lost all my power,'' she said. ``I was too tense.''  
</P>
<P>
	This time, the ride took only about 10 minutes and Ezeh was  
``confident and focused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle Fournier of South Carolina finished second at 206-5 and  
Renetta Seiler of Kansas State was third at 203-4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never threw in a ring with two inches of rain in it,''  
Seiler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ezeh nearly gave up the hammer throw last year after a  
discouraging 14th place in the European Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I went home, I started to think, `What am I going to  
do?''' she said. ``Everyone was waiting for me. I thought about the 
hammer throw and I thought about life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I decided I wanted to be good. I had gone down ... touched the  
bottom. Now, I would go up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ezeh, coached by former world-class hammer thrower Walter  
Ciofani, reached her peak Wednesday. It was her ninth victory in 11 
meets this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The hammer was one of four finals on the opening day's program.  
The others were the women's long jump and the men's discus and 
10,000 meters.

<HEADLINE> Taco Bell Marketing Chief Leaving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVINE, Calif. (AP) -- The advertising executive considered  
largely responsible for Taco Bell Corp.'s successful talking 
Chihuahua commercials is leaving the company to take a top 
marketing job with the Federal National Mortgage Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Vada Hill, 39, has been Taco Bell's chief marketing officer  
since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't long after his arrival that the big-eyed pup started  
appearing on television spots saying, ``Yo Quiero Taco Bell.'' 
Sales increased 3 percent in 1998 and 4 percent in the first 
quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill will become chief marketing officer of the  
government-chartered company known as Fannie Mae, which buys home 
loans in the secondary market. 
</P>
<P>
	The new job will give him the opportunity ``to make a meaningful  
contribution that comes straight out of politics, public policy and 
marketing -- true passions of mine,'' said Hill, a Harvard graduate 
who once worked for former U.S. Education Secretary Lamar Alexander 
on education reform. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chihuahua will continue to be featured in the advertising  
campaign for the 5,000 Taco Bell restaurants and 2,000 ``express'' 
outlets, spokeswoman Laurie Gannon said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Taco Bell is owned by Louisville, Ky.-based Tricon Global  
Restaurants Inc., which also owns Pizza Hut and KFC Corp.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Rapped on Storm Handling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROMULUS, Mich. (AP) -- A federal report released Wednesday  
criticized Northwest Airlines for being poorly prepared for a 
January blizzard that stranded thousands of passengers on runways 
at Detroit Metropolitan Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The report from the U.S. Department of Transportation found that  
Northwest did not violate any federal regulations during the storm, 
which dumped nearly 2 feet of snow at the airport. But it said 
conditions at the aircraft, including overflowing bathrooms and a 
lack of food and water, were ``severe enough to have jeopardized 
passengers' well-being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest challenged the implication that the airline does not  
care about its customers, and said changes have been made to 
prevent future tie-ups. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody doubts the passengers caught in that snowstorm were in  
a horrible, uncomfortable, inconvenient position,'' said Northwest 
spokesman Jon Austin. ``But our goal throughout the whole event was 
to ensure their safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials investigated the snowstorm at the request of  
U.S. Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the 
House Commerce Committee. He used the report to push for his 
``passenger bill of rights'' legislation and more competition among 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	An airplane passenger ``has less rights than anyone in our  
society except someone on death row,'' Dingell said at a news 
conference at the airport Wednesday. ``We cannot continue to exist 
in a situation where we have so little competition here that the 
rights of passengers are ignored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Austin said that competition already exists in Detroit, however.  
Despite Northwest's marketing prowess and dominance of the region, 
more than 40 percent of passengers at Detroit area airports choose 
to fly on other carriers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the storm on Jan. 2-3, Northwest planes stacked up on the  
tarmac, unable to take off or pull into a gate. Some passengers 
were stuck for up to eight hours in planes; some have since filed 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said Northwest officials in Minneapolis continued to  
send planes to Detroit as the blizzard began, even after other 
airlines had canceled all flights. Detroit is Northwest's 
second-largest hub, with about 500 flights a day -- about 80 percent 
of the airport's traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also criticized Northwest for not having a snow  
emergency plan for Detroit, and said Detroit workers did not tell 
Minneapolis planners how severe the storm was. 
</P>
<P>
	At a congressional hearing in March, Northwest executives said  
weather conditions were unprecedented. Wind chill reached 30 below 
zero on the first day of the storm, and snow fell as fast as two 
inches per hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Hirst, Northwest's senior vice president of corporate  
affairs, said at the March hearing that passengers were forced to 
wait on airplanes for gates to open because it was unsafe to bring 
them down the metal airline steps used by mechanics. The steps were 
frozen and slippery, he said, and passengers without proper winter 
clothing could have suffered from frostbite within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	But the federal report said Northwest did not consider some  
other options, such as borrowing the right kind of stairs from 
other airlines. Austin said all available options were considered. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Northwest apologized for the delays and announced  
changes in how it handles snow emergencies. Northwest will send 
employees to Detroit when bad weather is likely, and improve 
employee communications. The company said weather-related costs 
totaled about $20 million in the first three months of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the report cites some Northwest officials as saying  
that changes made since the storm would not necessarily prevent ``a 
recurrence of lengthy passenger strandings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other federal lawmakers have introduced bills similar to  
Dingell's that would require airlines to provide their customers 
more information about delays, bumping and pricing. Northwest is 
against any such bill, Austin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's a bad idea when government proposes to insert  
itself between a customer and a business,'' he said. ``Customers 
speak eloquently about what they need from business.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks To Extend China Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is hoping to renew China's  
normal trade privileges at a time of particularly strained 
relations with Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite tensions over allegations that China stole nuclear  
secrets from U.S. research facilities and NATO's mistaken bombing 
of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Clinton remains convinced 
engagement with China is in the United States' interests. 
</P>
<P>
	And after some angry rhetoric, Congress is expected to go along  
with the one-year extension of normal trade relations. The United 
States exported $14.3 billion in goods to China last year and 
imported $71.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., a longtime advocate of increased  
trade with China, said that strengthening economic ties to China 
has been ``a powerful force for positive change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we'll have success with it,'' he said. ``There is  
strong Republican support for this, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions between the United States and China forced  
administration negotiators to abandon hopes of negotiating China's 
entry to the World Trade Organization in time for Congress to vote 
on renewed trade ties and a WTO deal at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	After Clinton sends his decision to Capitol Hill, Congress has  
90 days if it wants to overturn the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1974 law, the president must seek an annual waiver to  
extend normal trade status to totalitarian states. Since 1980 every 
president has urged extending that status for China. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite concerns about human rights in China, Congress has never  
rejected such a request. 
</P>
<P>
	Resistance has been increased this year by anger over  
allegations that the Chinese government tried to influence U.S. 
elections by funneling donations to Democrats, coupled with 
concerns that Chinese spies stole nuclear technology from the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in  
Belgrade, which was blamed on faulty intelligence, has halted trade 
talks between the two nations about the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	Dreier drew a distinction between Clinton's call for a  
``strategic partnership'' with China and what Dreier sees as a 
straight business deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This business relationship is one that's very important for  
our economic future and the economic future of the 1.3 billion 
people in China,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. trade imbalance with China is second only to the one  
with Japan. That's one reason the administration, business leaders 
and Republicans such as Dreier, want China subject to the rules of 
the WTO, which would require China to grant more open access to its 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of  
Manufacturers, urged Congress to support extending trade relations 
and said that ``integrating China into the WTO would also foster 
stability in our commercial relations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a favor we are doing the Chinese, but rather a favor  
we would be doing ourselves,'' Jasinowski said.

<HEADLINE> Funds Weighed for State Graves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- When he was 3 years old, Al Warner was taken from  
his mother's arms. He was an old man when he found her again and 
knelt and put flowers on her grave. 
</P>
<P>
	No headstone decorated the burial site at a state institution,  
just a plain cement marker bearing the number 132. 
</P>
<P>
	``Numbers on her back -- I thought it was horrible,'' said  
Warner, who spent years in state institutions himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people who were once patients at state institutions  
in Massachusetts have only those ``numbers on their backs'' -- 
markers in overgrown, forgotten cemeteries -- and sometimes even 
less than that, activists say. 
</P>
<P>
	They deserve more, Warner and others argued May 26 at the  
Statehouse, where the State Administration Committee heard a bill 
that would provide funds for cemetery upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a matter of pride for those of us who have been  
diagnosed with mental illness, saying back to the community, `We're 
not garbage you can just throw away, but rather, we're human 
beings,''' said Pat Deegan, a former patient at Danvers State 
Hospital, who has coordinated the campaign for the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Deegan said the Department of Mental Health alone has estimated  
that there are 18,000 such graves on facilities it operates that go 
back to 1850. 
</P>
<P>
	And that doesn't count the graves on the grounds of other state  
institutions, such as the state schools meant to serve the mentally 
retarded, public health hospitals for the chronically ill, and 
state prisons, the activists said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Capone, 59, who spent decades of his life in a state school  
and state hospital, said better care should be taken of the 
cemeteries. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was not a movie. There were no actors or sketches. This  
was real. These people went through a lot,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebecca Macauley, 45, a patient rights activist and a former  
mental patient herself, said the former patients felt those buried 
in the cemeteries were ``family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have what they call in the military the camaraderie of  
shared suffering,'' said Macauley, who believes she has found a 
site in Northampton of the unmarked graves of former Northampton 
State Hospital patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Mental Health Commissioner Marylou Sudders testified for the  
bill, which would set aside the first half of 1 percent of the 
proceeds of a sale, lease or any other disposition of former sites 
of the Department of Mental Health, Department of Mental 
Retardation, Department of Public Health and Department of 
Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
	The state retains ownership of the cemeteries when it sells such  
properties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maintenance and memorialization are necessary at all such  
sites,'' Sudders said. ``While numbered markers pinpoint graves on 
the grounds, we must not forget that men, women and children with 
names and faces are interred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Activists want some money appropriated right away and envision  
markers on the graves that would at least include the person's name 
and dates of birth and death. Such markers cost about $60, activist 
Ruthie Poole said. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner is now 85 and retired, living in Amherst.  
</P>
<P>
	The grave of his mother, Ceceil Warner, was located three years  
ago at a cemetery at a DMR institution in Shrewsbury where patients 
from the former Worcester State mental hospital were buried. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he says, he's made arrangements so she has a ``nice granite  
stone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Your mother's always the best in the world, no matter what she  
was or what she wasn't,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Rallies Swamp Indonesia's Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- More than 100,000 people paraded  
through Jakarta on Wednesday, snarling traffic with political 
rallies in the final days of Indonesia's unexpectedly peaceful 
election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Waves of supporters from different parties danced through a  
downtown pond, loudly prayed in Arabic and listened to a singer 
perform through a makeshift sound system as the two-week campaign 
entered the homestretch before Monday's national election. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote is expected to be the freest in decades. President  
Suharto, who ruled the country for 32 years, left office last year 
after violent pro-democracy protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning will go on for two more days, followed by a two-day  
cooling-off period before the vote for 48 political parties. 
Hundreds of foreign electoral monitors are to watch over the poll, 
including a group of 100 led by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	The rallies Wednesday took on the feel of a peaceful street  
carnival, complete with food vendors. Troops and police looked on. 
</P>
<P>
	Traffic ground to a halt in the capital's center as masses of  
people, some wearing the Justice Party's white Islamic headdresses 
and others the Star and Moon party's green T-shirts, took part in 
the daily convoys down the main boulevard, closing all but one of 
the eight lanes through the heart of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of people jumped into a pond surrounding a statue in a  
major traffic circle. Others prayed loudly in Arabic to the beat of 
a drummer. Several climbed the 125-foot statue to hang their 
parties' flags. One man fell and was pulled from the shallow water 
unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
	After the crowd dispersed, Republic Party supporters in orange  
and National Mandate Party backers in blue took its place. 
</P>
<P>
	The congestion cleared after dark before the Indonesian People's  
Party, one of 10 parties authorized to have rallies Thursday, began 
its last campaign appearance at 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of Megawati Sukarnoputri's Indonesian Democratic  
Party for Struggle added to the growing crowd after midnight, 
waving their signature bright red flags with a black bull's head. 
</P>
<P>
	Buses parked in a circle around the pool as workers set up  
portable lights and a sound system that a singer used to keep 
hundreds of people entertained. The crowd dispersed at 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Cabinet meeting Wednesday, Information Minister Yunus  
Yosfiah said the government plans to go ahead with voting in Aceh 
province despite attacks by separatist rebels that now are being 
classified as a rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
	He quoted military commander Gen. Wiranto as telling a Cabinet  
meeting that 59 people, including 45 civilians, have been killed in 
the last month by the rebels. Another 96 civilians and 15 
security-force members were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The Parliament that is elected Monday will choose a president in  
November. Megawati, 52, the daughter of Indonesia's founding 
president, Sukarno, is considered the frontrunner.

<HEADLINE> Duval, Woods Return to Golf World  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- David Duval and Tiger Woods are together  
again, playing in the same tournament for the first time since the 
Masters almost two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	They are ranked Nos. 1 and 2 in the world and among the 105  
players in this week's Memorial Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't do it every week,'' defending champion Fred Couples  
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, they haven't done it at all. Duval has taken the last  
three weeks off since missing the cut in New Orleans, while Woods 
skipped the Colonial and Kemper the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet both believe the time away hasn't taken the edge off their  
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am coming off some time off,'' said Duval, who has already  
won four times this year and won almost $3 million on the PGA 
grind. ``But in the same sense, I expect to play well or I wouldn't 
have come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval spent his time fishing and doing ``nothing exciting.'' He  
said he practiced for maybe six days, less than he expected to work 
on his game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I intended to, but I didn't do a whole lot,'' he said with a  
grin. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, third on the money list and with a win at the Buick  
Invitational on Valentine's Day, tied for seventh at the Byron 
Nelson his last time out. He feels he's ready for a breakthrough 
win at Muirfield Village Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``The golf course has suited my game even though the scores  
don't reflect it,'' Woods said. ``I do like this golf course. It's 
just a matter of time before I get it going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods tied for 51st and 67th in his two previous Memorial  
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The golf course is always in great shape,'' he said.  
``Unfortunately, I haven't been able to put the scores together 
here. I don't know why. It's just one of those weeks where it just 
doesn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the last four years, Duval has been near the lead at  
the turn on Sunday. He's finished second twice and third once. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he looked forward to a potential showdown with Woods,  
he said, ``Oh, absolutely. I look forward to it being with anybody, 
as long as I'm a part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the top 10 on the PGA money list are on hand, as are 14  
of the top 20 players in the world rankings. Ernie Els, Justin 
Leonard, Greg Norman, Mark O'Meara and Spanish phenom Sergio 
Garcia, among others, all hope to use the Memorial as a springboard 
to the U.S. Open at Pinehurst in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good players have won here because this is an extraordinary  
field,'' Couples said. ``In a 156-man field, you get everyone that 
plays. Here it's 105 players, a lot of foreigners and other great 
players and it's a very strong field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tournament founder Jack Nicklaus will test his hip replacement  
in his former hometown on a course he designed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be just delighted if I can play four days,'' he said.  
``And I would be even more delighted if I were a contender. But, 
you know, I don't expect that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couples feels the same way. Since getting married in the last  
year, he has spent less time practicing and more time going to the 
zoo, soccer and softball games with his wife's two children. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a good shot that I'll play well, but there's a great  
shot that I won't,'' he said. ``And that's not very good odds.''

<HEADLINE> Washington State Receiver Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) -- Washington State's top pass receiver, Nian  
Taylor, has been arrested for investigation of domestic assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, 22, was charged Wednesday with third-degree malicious  
mischief and fourth-degree assault, misdemeanors carrying a year in 
jail and a $5,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	He was released on his own recognizance with the condition that  
he not contact the ex-girlfriend he is accused of assaulting, 
deputy prosecutor Toby Krauel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pullman police allege Taylor, elected the team's co-captain last  
week, followed the 22-year-old woman to her apartment on Tuesday, 
kicked the door off its hinges, and threw the door into the 
apartment. A police press release said Taylor also is accused of 
striking the woman in the chest with his fist and throwing water on 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman was bruised, but declined medical attention, police  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, a 6-foot-2, 200-pound senior from Riverside, Calif., led  
the Cougars with 847 receiving yards and eight touchdowns, catching 
45 passes in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports information director Rod Commons said head coach Mike  
Price would talk to Taylor and law enforcement officers before 
making any comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other WSU players have been charged with burglary and  
theft. One is the team's top rusher, Kevin Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	One is the Cougars' top rusher, running back Kevin Brown. All  
three have been suspended by Price, who said that if convicted they 
will be dismissed from the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were arrested May 20 at a campus housing complex after  
witnesses told police they entered an apartment through an unlocked 
door and left with a laptop computer and other electronics gear. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said $1,900 worth of electronics equipment was recovered.  
The players each face six to 12 months in jail if convicted.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche Goes to Dallas for Game 7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- After a restless night that followed several  
missed shots and one big missed opportunity, the Colorado Avalanche 
awoke Wednesday with a fresh perspective. Hey, it could be worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado followed its playoff-long trend of playing poorly at  
home and failed to eliminate Dallas in six games Tuesday night. The 
Stars won 4-1 to send the Western Conference finals back to Texas 
for Game 7 Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure everybody was rolling in bed saying, `Oh, we could  
have finished them,''' Colorado forward Claude Lemieux said 
Wednesday. ``But we could have lost Game 5 and won Game 6 and be 
real happy to be part of Game 7. It's the other way around. I'm 
real happy to be there, too, because we're one game away from going 
to the Stanley Cup finals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having lost six times in nine postseason home games, Colorado is  
heading into its comfort zone by changing time zones. The Avalanche 
are 8-1 on the road and have won two of three games in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL record for playoff road victories is 10 by the 1995 New  
Jersey Devils, the team Lemieux helped to the Stanley Cup title. 
Coincidentally, Colorado also won eight road games en route to the 
championship in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously for our club, I think the guys would much rather  
play in Dallas than play at home,'' Lemieux said. ``That's easy to 
say because regardless of if we would rather play at home, we're 
going on the road. But no one's going to complain about going to 
Dallas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux has been part of a Game 7 seven times in a 13-year  
career with Colorado, New Jersey and Montreal. His teams are 3-4 in 
such games, the most recent being the Avalanche's 4-0 loss at home 
to Edmonton last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Not since 1985 has Colorado prevailed in a seven-game series.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have to just open up the book we started writing since  
training camp,'' rookie coach Bob Hartley said. ``We've jumped many 
hurdles and we tripped on a couple of occasions. Every time we went 
down, we found ways to get back up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the series has been unpredictable at every turn,  
Hartley and Lemieux agreed that goaltending likely will determine 
who survives to play the Buffalo Sabres in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado goaltender Patrick Roy and Dallas goalie Ed Belfour  
have been solid throughout the series. The exception came in Game 5 
when the Avalanche outlasted the Stars 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can definitely count on Patrick,'' Hartley said. ``Patrick  
is feeding off those kinds of feelings. He is going to be ready to 
go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roy has won an NHL-record 110 playoff games and is 3-3 in Game  
7s. Belfour has 56 postseason victories and said he always won Game 
7 in his dreams as a kid. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux can do him one better.  
</P>
<P>
	``I dream of games like that, too, but I've played them and I've  
won,'' Lemieux said. ``That dream came true for me. Hopefully it 
will come true again. It's a lot of satisfaction.''

<HEADLINE> Automakers, Aluminum Industry Ally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co.,  
DaimlerChrysler AG and major aluminum makers plan to jointly 
research and develop ways to reduce the weight of tomorrow's cars 
and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	The automakers and aluminum companies announced formation of the  
Auto Aluminum Alliance today. The move stems from the car 
companies' cooperative research consortium, known as the U.S. 
Council for Automotive Research. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the council, GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler have been  
working toward a goal of reducing the weight of today's typical 
midsize sedan by 40 percent. New uses of lightweight metals are 
seen as a key to reaching that goal, which in turn will help 
increase fuel mileage and lower emissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers and their suppliers also are studying plastics and  
composites, as well as thinner, lighter-weight steel products. 
Their effort to reduce vehicle weight comes as U.S. consumers 
increasingly favor larger trucks and sport utility vehicles and 
government regulators pursue tougher pollution standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Through the alliance, the aluminum industry will come together  
and work more collaboratively with the auto industry to help them 
meet their future materials and customer needs,'' said Rick Milner, 
president of Alcoa Automotive. 
</P>
<P>
	The aluminum makers involved in the project are Alcoa Inc.,  
Alcan Aluminum Corp., Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corp., Reynolds 
Metals Co., Aluminum Precision Products, ARCO Aluminum Inc., Hydro 
Raufoss Automotive, Nichols Aluminum, VAW of America Inc., and 
Wabash Alloys. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the use of aluminum in the average vehicle has doubled  
since 1991, wider use in high-volume vehicles has been held back by 
costs and the need for different manufacturing and repair 
techniques. Aluminum costs three to five times more than automotive 
steel, pound for pound. The alliance will look at how aluminum's 
costs can be reduced and those areas where its use makes the most 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
	The group also will study ways to cost-effectively recover used  
aluminum from scrapped vehicles, develop standardized test methods 
for sheet aluminum and performance data for use by designers, and 
work to distribute information on repair of aluminum body parts.

<HEADLINE> Orange County Wants Tobacco Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Orange County could pay off about $600  
million in debt stemming from its 1994 bankruptcy by using money 
from the national tobacco industry settlement, the county's chief 
financial officer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a complex plan that involves purchasing bonds, the county  
would also use some of the money for jails, Chief Financial Officer 
Gary Burton told the Board of Supervisors Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton's plan would establish a nonprofit organization that  
would issue bonds based on the settlement revenue. The county would 
then use proceeds from the bonds sale, along with other savings, to 
pay off debts incurred when it emerged from bankruptcy in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The county will have immediate access to a much larger pool of  
money by selling bonds than if it simply accepted the settlement 
payments, which are estimated at $30 million to $38 million a year 
over 25 years. The nonprofit organization is necessary so the 
county can keep the new bond debt off its balance sheets, Burton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paying off bankruptcy debt ahead of schedule allows the county  
to avoid hefty interest payments, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got out of bankruptcy essentially on a credit card, and  
that's why one of (the) priorities is (eliminating) the debt,'' 
said county Chief Executive Officer Jan Mittermeier. 
</P>
<P>
	The county has $1.3 billion in outstanding debt related to the  
bankruptcy. The debt not paid through tobacco settlement funds 
would be paid off using other restricted funds, such as gas taxes, 
flood control funds and redevelopment money. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan also allows for about $150 million for other county  
departments such as jails or juvenile detention facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday ruled  
the county will have to show that Standard &AMP; Poor Inc., which gave 
the county's bonds top ratings before the crash, acted with 
``actual malice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orange County has settled its lawsuits with other firms. S&AMP;P is  
the major remaining holdout of firms sued by the county. 
</P>
<P>
	The county claims the high ratings contributed to a borrowing  
binge that forced its bankruptcy. S&AMP;P, which publishes a variety of 
financial analyses, has argued that its services for Orange County 
were covered by First Amendment guarantees of freedom of speech and 
press, and that it couldn't be liable.

<HEADLINE> Ewing Out for Rest of Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Patrick Ewing, plagued by injuries all season,  
will miss the rest of the playoffs for the New York Knicks because 
of a partially torn Achilles' tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing underwent tests this morning that confirmed the injury,  
just hours after he missed a potential tying shot at the buzzer in 
Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Pacers in 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old center will be in a cast for six weeks, the team  
said. The 14-year veteran has been slowed all season by his sore 
Achilles, and also has struggled with sore knees. He was out for 
most of last season after breaking his wrist during a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing does not need surgery and a full recovery is expected,  
said Dr. Norman Scott, the team's physician. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury to his left Achilles' tendon happened during warmups  
before Tuesday night's game. Nonetheless, Ewing played, scoring 10 
points and grabbing three rebounds in 25 minutes in the Pacers' 
88-86 victory that tied the series. 
</P>
<P>
	In leading New York to victory in Game 1, Ewing played 40  
minutes and had 16 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patrick wants to play but the injury prevents from being a  
possibility,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``After all that he has 
been through this year, playing injured and doing what he could do 
to help his team achieve the goal of competing for a championship, 
I feel very badly for him.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Probe Texas AG on Tobacco Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Federal prosecutors have subpoenaed records  
from the Texas attorney general's office on a private lawyer's 
claim to millions of dollars in fees for the state's tobacco 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The subpoena is the first confirmation that federal officials  
are investigating efforts by former Attorney General Dan Morales to 
have attorney Marc D. Murr, his former law partner, paid for his 
role in Texas' $17.3 billion settlement with the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The subpoena was issued May 20 and obtained today by The  
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Murr has now waived all claims to fees in the case, his lawyer  
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Morales led Texas' effort to sue eight tobacco companies and  
three trade groups in 1996 seeking reimbursement for public funds 
spent on Texans' smoking-related illnesses. The case was settled 
before trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Five private attorneys who helped represent the state were  
awarded $3.3 billion in fees. In December 1997, Murr asked for $520 
million, saying he advised Morales. 
</P>
<P>
	A state arbitration panel approved $260 million for him even  
though the other attorneys said Murr did little or no work on the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	The subpoena orders current state Attorney General John Cornyn  
to provide correspondence, computer and phone records, and other 
information to a grand jury meeting June 15 in Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not telling us what they are doing, but they are  
obviously trying to determine whether the evidence we uncovered and 
believe amounts to civil fraud rises to the level of criminal 
fraud,'' Cornyn said. He succeeded Morales in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, sources speaking on condition of anonymity told The  
Associated Press that the FBI had been comparing computer data to 
paper records to determine whether Morales backdated four contracts 
and letters to make it appear Murr was involved in the case longer 
than he really was. 
</P>
<P>
	In early May, Murr agreed to drop his claim to the $260 million  
agreed to the state panel and accept only $1 million recommended by 
a federal arbitration panel. That decision came just before a 
federal court hearing on whether the three members of the state 
panel were illegally selected because they were chosen by Murr and 
Morales. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, tobacco industry officials said they received an  
$82,000 check from Murr, reimbursing the companies for money paid 
so far as part of the $1 million award. 
</P>
<P>
	Murr has ended all efforts to seek payment for his role in the  
tobacco case and will not ask for any additional money, said his 
lawyer, Roy Minton. 
</P>
<P>
	Minton would not comment on the subpoena.  
</P>
<P>
	Morales did not immediately return a call for comment. In the  
past, he has denied all allegations of wrongdoing and said the 
accusations are politically calculated to prevent him from running 
for governor as a Democrat. Cornyn is a Republican.

<HEADLINE> Astronauts leaving space station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Discovery's astronauts are leaving  
the new international space station a little cozier and quieter for 
those who will follow in the year ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The space shuttle will pull away nearly 2 tons lighter Thursday  
evening after six days of linked flight. The seven astronauts began 
closing the station's hatches early Thursday after they finished 
carrying gear inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the more than 100 items they stowed aboard the two-room  
space station: laptop computers, water, clothes, trash bags and 
spare parts. 
</P>
<P>
	The astronauts got the place ready for its first permanent  
occupants, who are scheduled to move in next March. 
</P>
<P>
	``We spent a lot of this mission stowing supplies for them, so  
it should be pretty comfortable,'' said Ellen Ochoa, the astronaut 
in charge of all the moving. 
</P>
<P>
	Because no one will be back until December, one of the crew's  
last chores was to photograph every inch of the interior to help 
engineers on the ground solve any problems that might crop up. The 
astronauts also did a photo survey of the exterior one last time. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronaut Daniel Barry said Wednesday it was less noisy back in  
the Russian-made section of the space station than when the crew 
entered Sunday night, thanks to the mufflers he and others placed 
over clattering fans, ducts and outlets. Before the repairs, the 
noise level was equivalent to that of a busy street corner. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry said he measured the noise level at 65 to 69 decibels  
before the foam mufflers were installed. Afterward, it was about 3 
decibels lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Zarya is still noisier than the American-made section, called  
Unity, Barry said. ``But it certainly isn't a problem to be able to 
converse or do work in terms of the sorts of things we've been 
doing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA is far more concerned about the effects of noise on the  
astronauts who will spend months living aboard the space station. 
</P>
<P>
	The NASA engineer in charge of space station acoustics, Jerry  
Goodman, said before the mission that he wanted the noise level 
down to 60 decibels, which is what the specifications call for, or 
at least the low 60s. ``If you go much above that,'' he said, 
``you'll have to wear hearing protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Space shuttle Atlantis is supposed to carry up more supplies in  
December, but only if the Russians launch the station's living 
quarters in November as planned. Russia's economic crisis has 
stalled work on that piece, and the arrival of the first permanent 
crew is already almost two years behind schedule.

<HEADLINE> Upcoming Celebrity Birthdays  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *Celebrity Spotlight &AMP; Birthdays    	
</P>
<P>
	In the spotlight: Actress Natalie Portman, born June 9, 1981.  
</P>
<P>
	 *Personal stats:* Natalie Portman got into show business the  
old-fashioned way. She was sitting in a pizza parlor on New York's 
Long Island when someone offered her a job modeling for a 
children's fragrance. ``It's the classic discovery story,'' she has 
acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	She turned down the modeling job because she wanted to pursue  
acting. But the offer helped her get an agent to launch her career. 
She has appeared in several feature films, including Luc Bresson's 
``The Professional,'' and won high marks on Broadway playing the 
lead in ``The Diary of Anne Frank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She currently stars as Queen Amidala in ``Star Wars: Episode I --  
The Phantom Menace,'' battling alongside Jedi knights to save her 
people from the evil Trade Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Portman hadn't seen the original ``Star Wars'' trilogy when  
director George Lucas offered her the role in his new film. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was one of the last people in the world to see them,'' she  
said. ``I was the only one on the set who didn't freak out when 
they saw R2D2 for the first time. I think it probably helped me not 
to be caught up in the phenomenon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *Up Next:* Portman will star with Susan Sarandon in Wayne Wang's  
``Anywhere But Here,'' the story of a mother and daughter who must 
come to terms with their volatile relationship in the midst of a 
move from Michigan to Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Quote:*''Acting probably is making me grow up faster than I  
normally would because I'm around adults so much of the time. I'm 
friends with people much older than me, but they're all quite 
intent on maintaining my innocence.''

<HEADLINE> Brew Sets Sights on Breaking Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Each year since he was a junior in high  
school, Derrick Brew has clipped about one second per year off his 
400-meter time. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Brew do it again this season and dip under 44 seconds, he  
would move into some heady company. Only seven Americans have 
broken the 44-second barrier, led by world record-holder and 1988 
Olympic silver medalist Butch Reynolds' 43.29. 
</P>
<P>
	The others are 1996 Olympic gold medalist Michael Johnson, 1992  
Olympic champion Quincy Watts, 1992 Olympic trials winner Danny 
Everett, former world record-holder and 1968 Olympic winner Lee 
Evans, 1988 Olympic gold medalist Steve Lewis and 1968 Olympic 
silver medalist Larry James. 
</P>
<P>
	Brew had his sights set on Watts' NCAA meet record of 44.00 set  
in 1992, when he was competing for Southern California, in the 
national collegiate championships, which began today at Boise 
State's Bronco Field. The 400 final is Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I go in with the same mindset as in the SEC championships  
... and if I get a good push and hold my line, I think I have a 
good shot at Watts' record,'' Brew said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Brew is a junior at LSU, this is his first NCAA outdoor  
championship meet. He spent the past two years at Barton County 
Community College in Kansas. There, he won the 1998 national junior 
college outdoor championship in a record 44.53, a time that was 
eighth-best in the world last year. He also was the JUCO indoor 
champion and was ranked eighth in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, as a college freshman, he ran 45.21 and was the JUCO  
runner-up in the 400. In his final two scholastic years at Klein 
Forest High in Houston, he ran 47.40 and 46.63. As a senior, he won 
the Texas state championship and the national scholastic title. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, he owns the second-fastest time in the world, a  
career-best 44.29, in winning the Southeastern Conference title at 
Athens, Ga. He also won the SEC indoor championship and finished 
third at the NCAA indoors. 
</P>
<P>
	The overpowering performance outdoors -- he won by .80 seconds --  
added to Brew's confidence that he could become NCAA champion and 
LSU's first All-American in the 400 since Greg Hill in 1979. 
Earlier in the season, he got a big psychological boost by 
defeating defending NCAA champion Jerome Davis of Southern 
California in a U.S. Collegiate Track and Field Series meet at 
Baton Rouge, La. 
</P>
<P>
	He's not going into the NCAA meet overconfident, however.  
</P>
<P>
	``The 400 is hot this year,'' Brew said. ``In the SEC meet,  
there was one 44 (clocking) and five in the 45s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brew calls Johnson not only his idol, ``but the idol of all 400  
runners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I like his style,'' Brew said. ``He impresses me. His 400,  
he's strong and he has lots of speed. He kills people in the final 
200. He goes out the first 200 in 21.1 and it doesn't look like 
he's running hard because he's run 19.32 for the 200. 
</P>
<P>
	``He runs upright, he has those short legs and he has lots of  
turnover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brew's aim is to run 21.3 for the opening 200, then turn on the  
speed in the second half of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strongest part of my race is coming off the curve ... the  
final 150 meters,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to run faster than 21.1 for the first half. If I  
do, I could have problems the rest of the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers haven't had an NCAA quarter-mile champion since 1934,  
when Glen Hardin won his second consecutive 440-yard title. 
</P>
<P>
	LSU is not favored to win the men's title, but with Brew's help  
could finish in the top five. Last year, the Tigers tied for fourth 
with Arizona, behind Arkansas, Stanford and TCU. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas is heavily favored to win its eighth consecutive  
championship. The women's title is expected to be a battle among 
defending champion Texas; LSU, which won 11 straight years before 
the Longhorns broke the streak last season; and UCLA.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Olympic Official Blames U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- A Chinese Olympic leader sent a  
blunt message Wednesday to Congress: Mind your own business. 
</P>
<P>
	He Zhenliang, China's senior delegate on the International  
Olympic Committee, accused Sen. John McCain of meddling in Olympic 
affairs to advance his White House ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows nothing about Olympic Games,'' the official said of  
McCain. ``He used this for his own political purpose. This is 
political interference. Let the IOC deal with our own affairs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the IOC's new reform commission wrapped up its first round of  
meetings with moves toward democratic change, a backlash against 
U.S. politicians came to the fore. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, an Arizona Republican and presidential contender, has  
been harshly critical of the IOC for its role in the vote-buying 
scheme stemming from Salt Lake's successful bid for the 2002 Winter 
Games. He chaired Senate hearings into the scandal in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Commerce Committee, meanwhile, is investigating  
Atlanta's winning bid for the 1996 Summer Games, while pressuring 
the White House to place the IOC under international anti-bribery 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	And Congress has threatened to enact legislation that would  
cripple the IOC financially unless significant reforms are enacted. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, He said it was ``very  
sad'' that U.S. politicians were involved in the Salt Lake 
scandal's aftermath ``because America has contributed so much to 
the Olympic movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But if they interfere with sports for their own purpose, for  
their election campaigns, it will damage very seriously the image 
of American sports,'' He said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, McCain dismissed He's criticism.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll continue to be guided by the recommendations not of  
Chinese Olympics officials, but by (former) Sen. (George) Mitchell 
and his commission, whose considered views are respected in America 
and around the world,'' McCain said, referring to an inquiry on 
Olympic ethics headed by Mitchell, the former Senate majority 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	He's comments, which echoed those of Olympic officials from  
Europe and Australia, came as Beijing pursues a bid for the 2008 
Summer Games. The Senate passed a resolution opposing Beijing's 
failed bid for the 2000 Games on human-rights grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of political interference emerged at the end of a  
two-day meeting that produced wide-ranging debate on ways of 
restructuring the IOC and changing the Olympic bidding and 
selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC 2000, the reform commission, said the discussions  
underscored the need to ``move swiftly towards important reforms in 
areas such as democratization, ethics, representation and 
transparency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel said athletes -- elected by active Olympic competitors  
-- should be on the IOC, and promised to quickly implement a new 
bidding system for the 2008 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the most important result of this meeting is that we  
realize that we need to change the structure of the IOC,'' 
president Juan Antonio Samaranch said. He said the change would be 
made by the end of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, which is divided into three working groups, will  
submit a preliminary report June 20 at an IOC general assembly in 
Seoul, South Korea. Final recommendations are scheduled to be 
adopted in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, one of 36 outside  
members on the 80-member reform panel, said the IOC was moving in 
the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a legitimate forum and I think serious efforts  
have been made,'' he said. ``And there are enough outsiders so you 
get a certain perspective. I think there will be significant 
progress made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John MacAloon, an Olympic scholar at the University of Chicago  
and a member of the IOC 2000 panel, said he was amazed by the 
openness of the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``There hasn't been any taboo subject, including quite direct  
criticism by insiders as well as outsiders,'' he said. ``As far as 
having everything on the table, it's exceeded my expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Olympic Committee president William Hybl said the most  
significant outcome was the commitment to bring 
democratically-elected athletes into the IOC ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are a voice that will be a catalyst for change in years  
to come,'' Hybl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Delegates also pushed for greater representation on the IOC of  
women and leaders of international sports federations and national 
Olympic committees. 
</P>
<P>
	With as many as 10 cities preparing to run for the 2008 games,  
the working group on site selection backed a preselection process 
to weed out candidates failing to meet minimum technical 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also discussion of possible continental rotation of  
the games and even a proposal to select two host cities, with one 
on standby in case of problems with the No. 1 choice. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bears Cut Veteran Andy Heck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- Tackle Andy Heck, the linchpin in the  
Bears offensive line for four years, was released Tuesday by the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	The move, which was expected, saves the Bears Heck's base salary  
of $2.2 million under this year's salary cap and frees up money for 
rookie quarterback Cade McNown, the Bears first-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Heck, 32, has been a 10-year NFL starter since leaving Notre  
Dame. He was signed by Chicago as a free agent from the Seattle 
Seahawks in 1994. Troubled by back pain, his effectiveness declined 
last year and the Bears have tried unsuccessfully to trade him. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago signed free agent Blake Brockermeyer from the Carolina  
Panthers to start at left tackle.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Bills Let Patients Sue HMOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Patients denied medically necessary  
treatment by their HMOs could sue the managed-care plans for 
damages under landmark legislation backed Wednesday by the 
California Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar bills passed by the Assembly and Senate would give  
patients power that federal law now denies to most people covered 
by employer-sponsored health plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Health maintenance organizations and other managed-care plans  
limit patients' choice of doctors in exchange for lower premiums 
and lower fees for checkups and prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	California is among at least 30 states debating whether to give  
consumers the right to sue HMOs for damages. A Texas law allowing 
malpractice lawsuits against the plans was enacted in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``HMOs will be much more likely to defer to patients' needs and  
doctors' requests for medically necessary treatment because they 
will fear the hammer of damages if they don't do the right thing,'' 
said Jamie Court of Consumers for Quality Care, which has long 
sought the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents said the measures would cause health care costs to  
skyrocket without really helping patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The bills passed with only Democratic support.  
</P>
<P>
	Each proposal needs approval from the other house before it can  
go to Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, who has not said whether he would 
sign either of them.

<HEADLINE> At 24, Affirmed Still Going Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Brought from his stall to meet a visiting  
tour group, Affirmed strutted and posed, looking more like a 
Belmont Stakes-ready 3-year-old than a 24-year-old Triple Crown 
winner in his sunset years. 
</P>
<P>
	His back was level and still remarkably strong, and his chestnut  
coat showed only the lightest smattering of white hairs around the 
muzzle and eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does have that command presence, and he always knows when  
there's a camera around,'' Jonabell Farm manager Jimmy Bell said 
Wednesday. ``From a physical standpoint, he defies age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was 21 years ago that Affirmed made thoroughbred racing  
history by winning the Belmont and the Triple Crown in a riveting 
stretch duel with his archrival Alydar. 
</P>
<P>
	That race produced the sport's last Triple Crown winner. Since  
then, six colts have won the first two races - the Kentucky Derby 
and the Preakness - only to lose in the Belmont, including Silver 
Charm in 1997 and Real Quiet in '98. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, it's Charismatic's turn, and Affirmed's former  
jockey said he will be rooting for the D. Wayne Lukas-trained colt 
to end the Triple Crown drought. 
</P>
<P>
	``Affirmed will always have his place in history, and so will  
I,'' said Steve Cauthen, who was 18 then and a Kentucky horse 
breeder now. ``Nothing will change if Charismatic wins the Triple 
Crown, except it'll be good for racing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What's missing this time, though, is the fierce rivalry that  
binds Affirmed to Alydar to this very day. 
</P>
<P>
	Alydar finished second in all three races, coming closer to  
victory each time. Affirmed won by 1 1/2 lengths in the Derby, a neck 
in the Preakness and a mere head in the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	The most famous duel, of course, was the last, when Affirmed and  
Alydar battled side-by-side down the final seven furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He pulled it out under the most extreme situation,'' Cauthen  
said. ``Anyone that saw that race will never forget it, and 
probably remember it as the greatest race they ever saw.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Affirmed was retired to stud after the 1979 season, having won  
14 stakes races and more than $2.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Affirmed has not had as successful a stud career as Alydar, who  
was euthanized in 1990 after breaking a leg in his stall, or fellow 
Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew, now 25 and still standing at 
Three Chimneys. But his progeny have been strong turf runners and 
his daughters have made good broodmares. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the nearly 660 Affirmed foals who had reached racing age as  
of last fall, 68 had won stakes races. As a group, his foals had 
earned more than $33.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, when he's not in the breeding shed or posing for visitors,  
Affirmed splits time between the paddock and his stall in the 
Jonabell stallion barn, diagonally across from that of 1994 Horse 
of the Year, Holy Bull. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's a very content horse,'' Bell said. ``I think he  
enjoys his lifestyle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stallion manager Phillip Hampton said Affirmed's breeding book  
recently has been trimmed to about 45 mares a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just trying to sustain him here in the latter years,''  
Hampton said. ``By him still seeing mares and doing a good job of 
it, he's turned back the hands of time a little.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cauthen bred one of his mares to his former mount in 1998, and  
now is raising a 3-month-old Affirmed filly. When the former jockey 
came to visit Affirmed earlier this week, he showed off a snapshot 
of the foal to Hampton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was glad to breed to him and I'm glad I got a filly'' who  
might be both a runner and a broodmare, Cauthen said. ``Maybe he'll 
do me one more favor.''

<HEADLINE> Internet Startups Seek Backers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAGUNA NIGUEL, Calif. (AP) -- Like any good fisherman, investment  
banker Robert Kibble remembers the big one that got away. 
</P>
<P>
	A few years ago Kibble's company, Mission Ventures of San Diego,  
had a chance to invest in a tiny Internet commerce company called 
eToys that was trying to raise about $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the notion that a company that sold on the Internet  
could challenge big retailers like Toys R Us seemed farfetched. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were losing money; they had strong competition from Toys  
R Us. Unfortunately, we passed,'' Kibble said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	That eToys is now a toy industry leader worth about $7 billion  
wasn't lost on Kibble as he attended VentureNet 99, a conference 
that attracted more than 200 venture capitalists and other 
investors hoping to discover the next eToys or Amazon.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The success of companies like eToys has made small Internet  
startups the new darling of venture capitalists and investment 
bankers. 
</P>
<P>
	Venture capital investment in software and information  
technology companies rose 58 percent during 1998 to $4.5 billion, 
according to a survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers. The total number 
of mergers and acquisitions rose 14 percent, from 839 to 956. 
</P>
<P>
	At the first VentureNet in 1996, about 20 potential investors  
showed up. At the 1999 conference, which ended Wednesday, more than 
200 venture capital companies, investment bankers and law firms 
registered to take a look at 27 selected Internet startups. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, ``Venture capitalists didn't want to even touch the  
Internet,'' said William Manassero, executive director of the 
Software Council of Southern California, sponsor of VentureNet. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to drag them in. There were just no models to base an  
investment on,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That changed last year as the stocks of Internet companies such  
as Amazon.com and American Online climbed spectacularly. That 
stocks have slumped in recent weeks matters little to venture 
capitalists, who typically buy into a company before it goes 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where else can they get that kind of return? They won't get it  
in smokestacks,'' said Clay Womack, chief executive officer of 
Direct Stock Market, a Web site where potential investors can study 
and actually invest in small Internet ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	Womack raised $3 million for his company last year. At  
VentureNet, he was seeking another $30 million to expand the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Lance Cottrell was looking for about $4 million for his  
2-year-old company, Anonymizer.com, a web portal through which 
users can surf the Web without leaving a trail of information that 
would allow them to be identified. The site includes a free area 
supported by advertising and a premium service offered for $5 per 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Cottrell had several promising conversations with venture  
capital companies, but hadn't struck a deal by the end of the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our first big push for major funding,'' he said.  
``There seems to be a lot of interest, but we're farther along than 
a lot of companies. We have proof our business model works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite investors' greater interest in the Internet, however,  
most young companies never get the money they seek. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Draper, managing director of Draper Fisher Jurvetson,  
said his firm gets about 10,000 queries each year from high-tech 
entrepreneurs. About 20 of them get money. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of money out there from the venture capitalists,  
but there are also a lot of business plans,'' said Richard Brandt, 
editor-in-chief of Upside, a magazine that focuses on Internet 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't have the right connections or a business plan  
that really stands out, it's going to be hard to get the money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of those who fail simply haven't done enough work to set  
themselves apart from the herd, Draper said during a panel 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you come in with a creative idea, an extraordinarily  
creative idea, you usually come out with money,'' he said. ``There 
is a real premium for creativity right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next few years, the most attractive investments won't  
be online retailers like Amazon.com, but companies that design and 
produce the software and electronics used to create electronic 
commerce, said Mark Stevens, a general partner in Sequoia Capital, 
the company that helped fund Yahoo! in its infancy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Business-to-business is a key area,'' said Stevens. ``There is  
a lot of opportunity for Internet equipment and development 
companies.''

<HEADLINE> HBO's 'Sopranos' Returns June 9 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Encore, encore! ``The Sopranos,'' HBO's  
brilliant series about the all-American mob family, is coming back 
in reruns. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's the chance to discover, or savor again, one of the best  
series ever on television. Don't receive HBO? This is a drama worth 
begging, borrowing or -- in keeping with the show's theme -- stealing 
a friend's video tapes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sopranos'' sings a brutal yet comedic song about a  
suburban New Jersey family headed by crime boss Tony Soprano and 
his elegantly tough wife, Carmela. On weekends, they barbecue; on 
weekdays, Tony burns his enemies. 
</P>
<P>
	He's got more to worry about than the feds, however. His psyche  
is unraveling, with his bitter and fearsome mother delicately 
pulling the thread. The other key woman in his life is a therapist 
helping this wise guy find his inner, abused child. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anxiety attacks are legitimate psychiatric emergencies,'' says  
Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), trying to persuade her shaky 
but reluctant patient (James Gandolfini) to open up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nowadays, everybody has to go to shrinks and counselors. ...  
It's dysfunction this and dysfunction that,'' huffs Tony. ``I had a 
semester-and-a-half of college. I understand Freud. I understand 
therapy as a concept. But in my world, it does not go down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If ``The Sopranos'' nailed only the colorful characters and dark  
underbelly of organized crime, it would be achievement enough. But, 
by placing the Soprano family in the bosom of angst-ridden 
suburbia, it expands into a trenchant dissection of the American 
dream. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lately, I'm getting the feeling that I came in at the end. The  
best is over,'' says Tony, lamenting the passage of the mob's glory 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Responds Melfi: ``Many Americans, I think, feel that way.''  
</P>
<P>
	These cozy sessions are intercut with family squabbles and  
violent ``business'' transactions, giving ``The Sopranos'' a 
whipsaw effect that keeps viewers from getting at all comfortable -- 
or, at times, from feeling entirely removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't just lie and cheat and break the rules you don't  
like,'' Carmela (Edie Falco) says in chastising her daughter for 
violating curfew. The irony runs deep for the Sopranos, but it's a 
scenario any parent can understand. 
</P>
<P>
	The series' 13 episodes air 9 p.m. EDT Wednesday beginning June  
9. It returns for a second season next January. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sopranos'' brings to mind another sublime TV experience,  
PBS' 1970s series ``I, Claudius,'' a dark and witty take on the 
machinations of Roman emperors and their families. Both series are 
dominated by scheming matriarchs named Livia, with the masterful 
Nancy Marchand (Mrs. Pynchon in ``Lou Grant'') doing the 
``Sopranos'' honors. 
</P>
<P>
	Happily, all the elements in the HBO series are on a par: the  
acting, writing and music are flawless and the cinematography is as 
well suited to a movie screen as a TV set. The language is coarse, 
the violence and sex is graphic. It's never gratuitous, but 
nonetheless, adults be warned: This is NOT a show for children. 
</P>
<P>
	That ``The Sopranos'' ended up on cable was probably inevitable  
and almost certainly its salvation. Creator-executive producer 
David Chase (``I'll Fly Away'' and ``Northern Exposure'' are among 
his writing credits) first gave the pilot script to Fox in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of their executives called me and said, 'I just want to  
tell you on a human level that I really liked the script,''' Chase 
recalled. ``I was naive enough to say, 'Oh, good. When are we going 
to get started with casting?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The executive's reply: ``Whoa, whoa, whoa.'' Apparently a human  
level and a timid network level bear no relationship to each other. 
Fox passed, and Chase believes he understands why. 
</P>
<P>
	``It think it's an attitude that was rejected and not profanity,  
violence or nudity, because those things didn't exist in the 
network version,'' he said. The attitude? America's got problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of hypocrisy -- people are crooks, life isn't  
necessarily beautiful here, products that you see advertised aren't 
necessarily what they claim to be,'' said Chase. 
</P>
<P>
	The series' vision is his, but Chase has surrounded himself with  
top writers. He has worked before with some, such as former 
``Northern Exposure'' colleagues Robin Green and Mitchell Burgess, 
while others are newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mob knowledge is not required. Chase admits he draws more on  
gangster films like ``The Godfather'' than his experience growing 
up in New Jersey, where he heard only vague rumors of mob-connected 
neighbors or relations. 
</P>
<P>
	More valuable, Chase finds, is a writer who has logged shrink  
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``This may sound funny, but people who haven't been through  
therapy have a tough time with the show. They are constantly 
saying, 'Well, wouldn't Melfi call and tell Tony not to do this? 
She wouldn't say something is wrong?' and we all say, 'No.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The low-key Chase, touted as the hottest thing in TV after the  
successful first season of ``Sopranos,'' says his primary concern 
is keeping the series on track as production begins this month on 
the next 13 episodes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more successful now than I ever dreamed, so I don't want  
to mess with anything. Leave it alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And his biggest thrill? Receiving a French television festival  
award for the series, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's my dream, all I ever wanted to do. Win a prize in  
France, I don't care what prize. I was thinking of Cannes but . 
...'' Chase shrugged wryly.

<HEADLINE> Bush Becomes Everyone's Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Keynoting his Republican presidential  
campaign, Texas Gov. George W. Bush celebrated the 140 days of the 
Texas legislature as a bipartisan success story that shows -- ``if 
anybody was paying attention'' -- what he could do in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The next 140 days may determine whether he gets to try, as Bush  
tests the GOP lead he's gained from the sidelines and faces the 
challenges that go with it. 
</P>
<P>
	One is, quite simply, that he is everybody's target -- 10  
Republican rivals and the Democrats who want to cut away the lead 
the polls accord him in the 2000 presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is moving onto the campaign stage in a starring role,  
without benefit of the trial runs and tryouts that can prepare a 
candidate for national competition. 
</P>
<P>
	His ratings soared past the field while he stayed put in Austin.  
Republican leaders came to him. More than half the GOP governors 
and members of Congress have endorsed him. He will have raised at 
least $16 million in the first six months of the year. All that 
plus the polls, for a second term governor with a presidential name 
but no national political experience, and only generalized 
proposals on what he'd do in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	As the 20 weeks of the Texas legislature dealt with his state  
programs -- he won some and lost some but didn't mention the latter 
-- so the next 20 weeks of the campaign, through late October, will 
be crucial to his national plans. 
</P>
<P>
	He's got to introduce himself to the voters, work the key  
primary states, withstand such tests as an Aug. 14 straw vote in 
Ames, Iowa, where he is not likely to fare well, decide whether to 
forgo federal campaign subsidies in order to run without the 
spending limits it entails. 
</P>
<P>
	And, for that matter, move from his current just-testing mode to  
become a declared candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to understand, I've been here doing my job,'' Bush  
said Tuesday at his end-of-session news conference. He said the 
legislative record was solid, substantial and bipartisan, and that 
he thinks he could do something about excessive partisanship in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe an administration can change the tone,'' Bush said.  
``And that's what I intend to try to convince people that I'm going 
to do. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll have specific agendas that I hope and think people will  
like. But at the beginning of the campaign, I'm going to set the 
tone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He starts campaigning June 11, in Iowa, then moves on to New  
Hampshire, then 10 more states by the end of the month. He's said 
he won't yield to the inevitable pressure for immediate answers on 
every issue, but will deal with policy proposals on his own 
timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	That works for campaign leaders. But let the lead slip, and it  
becomes more difficult. There is a history of early front-runners 
who stumbled and never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand these polls and expectations are out of sight,''  
Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	They may be too high to stay there.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just need to get out and start moving around some and make  
sure the sentiment that I'm told is out there is out there,'' Bush 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	His Republican rivals are both questioning it and trying to  
heighten expectations to make it more difficult for Bush to meet 
them. That's standard procedure in challenging an early leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander says Bush should be  
expected to win big everywhere, including that Iowa straw poll. 
Alexander's campaign is rated the best organized for that show, and 
most likely to win it. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander said he was glad to see Bush get off the front porch  
and into the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle says the Bush phenomenon is a  
poll-driven rush to judgment that could be disastrous for the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	``And now that the long parliament known as the Texas  
legislature has adjourned and Governor Bush has emerged from his 
tutorials,'' said another GOP presidential prospect, Patrick 
Buchanan, ``perhaps the great debate over America's destiny and 
role in the world can get under way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In all those comments there is a touch of the frustration of  
candidates who have been running long and hard, while Bush gained 
his early standing without leaving home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I'm late in particular states,'' Bush said.  
</P>
<P>
	Actually, in all of them except Texas.

	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres have the best record in

world, and they have speed and depth. 
</P>
<P>
	What they want is their names on the Stanley Cup.  
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres didn't celebrate after eliminating the Toronto Maple  
Leafs from the playoffs with a 4-2 win in Game 5 of the Eastern 
Conference finals on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	They couldn't get excited about the Prince of Wales Trophy. They  
didn't even want to touch it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't the Stanley Cup,'' Sabres captain Michael Peca  
explained. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest series will be the Sabres against the winner of the  
Western Conference finals between Dallas and Colorado, now headed 
for a seventh game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres have never won a Stanley Cup since they joined the  
NHL in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo players and fans are constantly reminded of the fact by  
three banners hanging in Marine Midland Arena for retired jersey 
numbers worn by the fabled French Connection line of Rene Robert, 
Rick Martin and Gilbert Perreault. 
</P>
<P>
	The three French Canadians teamed to give the Sabres 738 goals  
and 1,681 points from 1972 to 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	The finesse line led Buffalo to six playoff appearances and its  
only trip to the Stanley Cup finals in 1975. Their vulnerability 
was exposed when the Sabres lost in six games to Philadelphia's 
Broad Street Bullies. 
</P>
<P>
	Concluding that other teams lost to the Sabres by failing to  
keep up with the French Connection, Flyers coach Fred Shero sent 
out Bill Clement, Orest Kindrachuk and Bob Kelly to rough up the 
Buffalo stars and wear them down. 
</P>
<P>
	These Sabres have too much depth and muscle to be worn down.  
They soared through the playoffs without their leading scorer, 
Miroslav Satan. Buffalo also split the first two games in Toronto 
with backup Dwayne Roloson in net. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only reason we're still here is because of our depth,''  
said Sabres wing Dixon Ward, who finished the Maple Leafs with an 
empty-net goal in the closing seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the past few years, we've learned one or two lines and  
four or five defensemen won't win the Cup. We have 20 guys all 
going in the same direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres are a blend of speed and toughness. Peca, one of the  
top checkers in the league, has made a career out of smothering 
opponents' top scorers. The list includes Ottawa's Alexei Yashin 
and Boston's Jason Allison. 
</P>
<P>
	Add to the list Maple Leafs center Mats Sundin, who had just one  
assist and one shot in Game 5. The Sabres also zoomed in on 
high-scoring veteran Steve Thomas and held him to no points in the 
deciding game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was no secret that Thomas had a sore shoulder,'' Peca said.  
``You want to punish people and take away their effectiveness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we were capable of beating Buffalo, but we hit a  
bump in the road,'' Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhett Warrener, who arrived in a March 23 trade with Florida for  
Mike Wilson, added some pop to the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Washington Capitals forward Joe Juneau, who scored a goal  
to sink the Sabres and send Washington to the Stanley Cup finals 
last year, added finesse. 
</P>
<P>
	Power-play sniper Stu Barnes, acquired in a trade that sent  
disgruntled Matthew Barnaby to Pittsburgh, has come out of a slump. 
So has speedy Geoff Sanderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Everybody works. Everybody contributes something. Coach Lindy  
Ruff, a former blue-collar Sabres captain, demands it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at that team now; they made some changes,'' Toronto coach  
Pat Quinn said. ``They added talented players, and now they are 
doing things they didn't do before. They finish a lot of checks 
now. The Joe Juneaus, the Geoff Sandersons, they never finished any 
checks in their life, but they're doing it right now.''

<HEADLINE> Miller Takes His Shots at Ewing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- About an hour after Reggie Miller hit the  
two free throws that won Game 2, he sat at the podium for his news 
conference and spotted Patrick Ewing entering in the room. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as you make the last (shot), that's all that  
matters,'' Miller said. ``Right, Pat?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jab was too easy for Miller to resist, coming after Ewing's  
last-gasp jumper hit the back of the rim. 
</P>
<P>
	After restraining himself for more than a week and not saying  
anything even remotely controversial, Miller struck with his first 
dig. And the remark figures to only fuel the animosity that makes 
the Pacers-Knicks rivalry such a great one. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a war,'' Ewing said.  
</P>
<P>
	Both teams took the day off Wednesday since the series, tied  
1-1, will not resume until Saturday at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, the hostility will shift the other way -- most of it  
aimed squarely at the No. 1 Knick killer of the decade, Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	At Market Square Arena, the Knicks had to put up with taunting  
Indiana fans. Some of them behind the New York bench unleashed a 
stream of insults. Others showered the players with beer and hurled 
coins as they left the court. 
</P>
<P>
	During the game, the jeering of Ewing became so intense that he  
waved his arms in an emphatic ``bring it on'' gesture completely 
out of character for the 14-year veteran. At another point, Ewing 
mixed it up in a friendly manner with four Pacers fans sitting 
alongside the players' seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't like me here,'' Ewing said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ewing's animated Rileyesque gesture, coming as it did when the  
Knicks were falling behind by 17 points, was somehow indicative of 
the confidence he and his team are playing with this postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	A month and a half ago, a 17-point deficit would have spelled  
certain doom for a team struggling to incorporate so many new 
additions and uncertain if it would make the playoffs -- or whether 
its coach would survive to see another day on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, however, there is a fearlessness and cockiness to  
the Knicks that has surprised the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won, and it was not a pretty win, but a win is a win,''  
Antonio Davis said. ``New York will not go away. We must get ready 
to get in their house and go to work. We're looking forward to 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most irritating to both teams was the way Game 2 was officiated  
by the veteran crew of Dick Bavetta, Hue Hollins and Joe Forte. New 
York was whistled for 40 fouls, including five on its point guards 
in the first nine minutes of the game. Miller hit the winning free 
throws with 2 seconds left after Chris Childs was whistled for his 
sixth foul. 
</P>
<P>
	``We let the officiating overwhelm us at first,'' Allan Houston  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana's Rik Smits was limited to 13 minutes because of foul  
trouble, with a couple of the calls that went against him among the 
most questionable of the night. 
</P>
<P>
	After Miller made his free throws, New York had one last chance.  
Charlie Ward, a former Heisman-winning quarterback at Florida 
State, whipped a court-length pass to Ewing near the opposing free 
throw line. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing wheeled and tossed up a high-arching shot that caromed off  
the rim. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good look -- just missed,'' said coach Jeff Van Gundy,  
who contained himself when asked to comment on the officiating. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Johnson, Childs and Chris Dudley fouled out, Kurt Thomas,  
Ewing and Ward had four apiece and Marcus Camby had five -- the last 
of which was a blocking foul with 31 seconds left that the Knicks 
strongly felt should have gone the other way. 
</P>
<P>
	``When your best players are sitting next to you,'' Van Gundy  
said, ``it's not a great feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Childs: ``We took their best shot, and I'm pretty sure  
there's going to be more shots taken, but I'm telling you, this is 
a special, special group of guys. We have so much fight and 
determination in us. We're going to play to the end.''

<HEADLINE> Sabres' Patrick Wants Shot at Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- James Patrick was so close to being on a  
Stanley Cup winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, New York traded him to Hartford during the 1993-94  
season before capturing the NHL's top prize in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're a kid you dream of playing in the NHL and winning  
the Stanley Cup,'' Patrick said Wednesday. ``Once you come into the 
league you realize how hard it is to win it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Winnipeg, Manitoba, native finally has another shot at the  
Cup. Patrick is a Buffalo defenseman now, and the Sabres, winners 
of the Eastern Conference championship, will play the winner of the 
Colorado-Dallas series for the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Drafted in the first round by the Rangers in 1981, Patrick found  
his playing time cut dramatically in the 1993-94 season when he 
didn't get along with New York coach Mike Keenan. Then came the 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``The frustrating part for me was wondering where my career was  
going and knowing that I no longer fit with the Rangers' plans,'' 
Patrick said. ``I wasn't being used and I started to question my 
ability. When I got traded, I was happy to move on and try to get 
my career back on track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers went on to win their first Stanley Cup in 54 years.  
Patrick went on to Calgary in a trade after spending just 47 games 
with the Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
	After five enjoyable but uneventful seasons in Calgary, Patrick  
signed with Buffalo as an unrestricted free agent before the season 
opener in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were looking for a little maturity and leadership in the  
back end,'' said Sabres coach Lindy Ruff, whose team lost to the 
Washington Capitals in the Eastern Conference final last season. 
``We thought it was something that was lacking in the playoffs last 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick, who turns 36 in two weeks, has done everything the  
Sabres have asked, and that has included sitting down. He played in 
45 games during the season and was a healthy scratch for 33 more. 
</P>
<P>
	A healthy corps of younger defensemen, including newcomer Rhett  
Warrener, made Patrick seem expendable, and the veteran didn't play 
in 16 of the last 18 games of the regular season. He also sat out 
the Sabres' first playoff game, a 2-1 win over Ottawa that saw the 
Senators score a power-play goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff turned to Patrick for his experience and penalty-killing  
skills. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great penalty killer and doesn't tighten up in key  
situations,'' said Ruff. ``He's the type of player you want to 
surround your young guys with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick secured a spot with Jason Woolley. Patrick plays the  
role of the steady, stay-at-home defenseman. That allows Woolley, 
the Sabres' leading scorer in the playoffs, to charge out 
occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does a great job killing penalties and moving the puck out  
of the zone, whether it's banking it off the glass or making a nice 
pass,'' Sabres wing Dixon Ward said. ``He rarely gets caught.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not flashy, not a big hitter and not a big shooter, but  
he plays the game smart and he's always ready,'' Ward said. ``He 
stepped into the second game of the playoffs and I thought he was 
our best defenseman after playing two games in a month and a 
half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick figures this is his last shot at the Cup.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely running out of time,'' he said. ``Right now I'm  
just thinking about right now and just trying to enjoy this 
moment.''

<HEADLINE> Ireland Bars Yugoslav Soccer Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Ireland barred Yugoslavia's soccer team  
from entering the country this weekend and criticized European 
soccer chiefs for refusing to cancel the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Ireland team manager Mick McCarthy and the Football Association  
of Ireland supported the government's decision Wednesday to 
withhold entry visas, even though this could jeopardize the Irish 
team's chances of qualifying for the 2000 European Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's Group 8 qualifier would have been the first  
international match for Yugoslavia since NATO launched its air 
campaign March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The government of Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said it was  
``convinced that it would not be appropriate'' to admit the 94 
Yugoslav players and support staff who applied for visas Tuesday at 
the Irish embassy in Athens, Greece. 
</P>
<P>
	The government cited ``the terrible and unacceptable situation  
on the ground in Kosovo'' and the recent indictment of Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic as a war criminal. 
</P>
<P>
	It also questioned UEFA, Europe's soccer governing body, for  
ignoring directives from the 15-nation European Union ``not to 
arrange international sporting events with the participation of 
Yugoslavia, given the illegal and appalling actions of the Yugoslav 
regime against the people of Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement was issued hours after UEFA's directors rejected  
an appeal from European Union sports ministers to postpone the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	UEFA had no immediate response.  
</P>
<P>
	Though Ireland has long refused to join NATO, it has taken about  
1,000 ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo and maintains strong 
relations with all the major NATO countries. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy, whose team is in a four-way tie atop Group 8 with e  
Croatia, Macedonia and Yugoslavia, said his players' hopes of 
qualifying for the championship ``pale into insignificance'' with 
the problems facing homeless Kosovars. 
</P>
<P>
	Ireland's top soccer executive, Bernard O'Byrne, said UEFA might  
ask the Irish team to play Yugoslavia outside Ireland. More 
punitive options would involve Ireland receiving an automatic loss 
or being expelled from the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	UEFA has already barred Yugoslavia from staging any home  
matches, rescheduling these in Salonica, Greece. Its next game 
there is June 8 against Group 8 cellar-dweller Malta.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays Select Hamilton No. 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- High school outfielder Josh Hamilton was taken  
by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays today with the first pick in baseball's 
amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, from Athens Drive High School in North Carolina,  
became the first high school player selected first since the 
Seattle Mariners chose Alex Rodriguez in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, 6-foot-4, is an outstanding hitter projected to be a  
right fielder, even though he has a 94 mph fastball. He hit .514 
with 13 homers and 36 RBIs this season, and is also regarded as a 
sound defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess not going No. 1 wouldn't have totally destroyed me,''  
Hamilton said. ``But there's prestige going No. 1, and I'm 
certainly happy to be No. 1. I just want to play ball. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Right-hander Josh Beckett was taken by Florida with the second  
pick. Beckett, from Spring High School in Texas, was the first high 
school righty taken as high as second since Bill Gullickson in 
1979. He was 13-2 with an 0.39 ERA and 178 strikeouts in 89 innings 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Beckett, also 6-4, has impressed scouts with a fastball that  
hits the mid-90s consistently, and a lively curveball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being a first-round pick in the draft is the main thing.  
That's always been my dream,'' Beckett said. ``It's not about being 
the first or even the second. It's about being a first-round 
pick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit then chose Southern California catcher Eric Munson.  
Munson, who will be playing in the NCAA's super regionals against 
Stanford starting Friday, is hitting .338 with 14 homers and 40 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Munson, a left-handed power hitter, missed 21 games because of a  
broken hand midway through the season, but picked up where he left 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona unexpectedly chose high school shortstop Corey Myers.  
Myers hit. 560 with 22 homers and 77 RBIs for Desert Vista High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota then chose outfielder B.J. Garbe with the fifth pick.  
Garbe, from Moses Lake High School in Washington, hit .500 with six 
homers and 22 RBIs this season. He is recognized by scouts as a 
five-tools player. Garbe, an exceptional athlete, was the first 
high school quarterback in the state to run and pass for over 1,000 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal selected left-hander Josh Girdley from Jasper High  
School in Texas. Girdley struck out 29 in 10 innings earlier this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	With the seventh pick, Kansas City chose North Carolina  
right-hander Kyle Snyder. Snyder was 8-5 during an inconsistent 
season during which he missed two weeks with triceps tendinitis. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh chose high school right-hander Bobby Bradley with the  
eighth pick. Bradley threw seven one-hitters this season for 
Wellington High School in Florida, and was 12-1 with an 0.38 ERA 
and 156 strikeouts in 92 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland took Southern California left-hander Barry Zito with the  
ninth pick. Zito, 11-2, had three 16-strikeout games for the 
Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee selected Northeast Louisiana right-hander Ben Sheets.  
Sheets was 14-1 and is a pure strikeout artist. He had a 
20-strikeout game against Louisiana Tech earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle took high school catcher Ryan Christianson with the 11th  
pick. Christian, from Arlington High School in California, hit .507 
with seven homers and 39 RBIs this season. Many scouts consider him 
the best all-around catcher in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia then took right-hander Brett Myers from Englewood  
High School in Florida. Baltimore, using the first of its four 
first-round picks, chose Clemson right-hander Mike Paradis. 
Cincinnati selected left-hander Ty Howington from Hudson's Bay High 
School in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago White Sox chose high school righty Jason Stumm with  
the 15th pick. Stumm, an excellent athlete who starred in baseball, 
basketball and football at Centralia High School in Washington, was 
10-0 with an 0.84 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor's Jason Jennings, the nation's top two-way player, was  
taken by Colorado with the 16th pick. Boston took outfielder Rick 
Asadoorian from North Bridge High School in Massachusetts with the 
next pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore chose left-hander Richard Stahl from Newton High  
School in Georgia. Toronto selected third baseman/outfielder Alex 
Rios from San Pedro Martir High School in Puerto Rico. With the 
20th pick, San Diego chose outfielder Vince Faison from Toombs 
County High School in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Next, Baltimore took Ball State outfielder Larry Bigbie. San  
Francisco then took Louisiana State righty Kurt Ainsworth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago White Sox next selected Mississippi State  
right-hander Matt Ginter. Baltimore chose Providence College 
outfielder Keith Reed. Kansas City took Wake Forest right-hander 
Mike MacDougal with the 25th pick. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Cubs took Wichita State right-hander Ben  
Christensen, who was suspended by the Missouri Valley Conference 
for hitting Evansville's Anthony Molina in the head with a warmup 
pitch before their game April 23. 
</P>
<P>
	The pitch cut Molina over the left eye, broke his cheekbone and  
may have caused permanent damage. Before the suspension, 
Christensen was 9-1 with a 2.40 ERA for the Shockers. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees selected Arkansas righty David Walling with  
the 27th pick. San Diego, with the next two picks, chose Gerik 
Baxter, a right-hander from Edmonds-Woodway High School in 
Washington, and right-hander Omar Ortiz from Texas-Pan American. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Cardinals chose right-hander Chance Caple from  
Texas A&AMP;M with the final pick of the first round.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks To Extend China Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will ask Congress to extend  
normal trade relations with China on Thursday, reigniting an annual 
debate that has been made even more emotional this year by spying 
accusations and an accidental bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. relations with Beijing have been strained recently by the  
allegations that China stole nuclear secrets from U.S. research 
facilities and by NATO's mistaken bombing of the Chinese Embassy in 
Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton remains convinced that engagement with China is key  
to improving relations and helping businesses in both nations. And, 
after some angry rhetoric, Congress is expected to go along with 
the one-year extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions between the United States and China forced  
administration negotiators to abandon hopes of negotiating China's 
entry to the World Trade Organization in time for Congress to vote 
on renewed trade ties and a WTO deal at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton plans to send his decision to Congress on Thursday,  
officials said Wednesday. Congress then will have 90 days if it 
wants to overturn the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1974 law, the president must seek an annual waiver to  
extend normal trade status to totalitarian states. Since 1980 every 
president has urged extending that status for China. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite concerns about human rights in China, Congress has never  
rejected such a request. 
</P>
<P>
	Resistance has been increased this year by anger over  
allegations that the Chinese government tried to influence U.S. 
elections by funneling donations to Democrats, coupled with 
concerns that Chinese spies stole nuclear technology from the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in  
Belgrade, which was blamed primarily on faulty intelligence, has 
halted trade talks between the two nations about the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the United States exported $14.3 billion in goods to  
China last year and imported $71.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., a member of the GOP leadership,  
said that strengthening economic ties to China has been ``a 
powerful force for positive change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we'll have success with it,'' he said. There is strong  
Republican support for this, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Dreier drew a distinction between Clinton's call for a  
``strategic partnership'' with China and what Dreier sees as a 
straight business deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This business relationship is one that's very important for  
our economic future and the economic future of the 1.3 billion 
people in China,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade imbalance with China is second only to the one with  
Japan. That's one reason why the administration, and Republicans 
such as Dreier, are eager to get China into the WTO, where it would 
have to grant more open access to its markets.

<HEADLINE> Officials Fear Hantavirus Outbreak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Six years ago, people in a vast stretch of  
the Southwest were fearful of a mysterious, flu-like illness that 
was killing the previously healthy with frightening speed. The fear 
is back. 
</P>
<P>
	Four New Mexicans and one person from Colorado have died this  
year of hantavirus, and experts are worried this could be the 
beginning of an especially bad year for the mouse-borne disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the beginning of 1998, there have been more than two dozen  
cases in the Four Corners states of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and 
Colorado -- more than twice as many as in the previous three years 
combined, said Dr. Brian Hjelle, associate professor at the 
University of New Mexico School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conventional wisdom is, it's El Nino,'' he said. The  
cyclically recurring disruption in the tropical Pacific made for a 
wetter-than-usual 1997-98, followed by a milder, drier ``La Nina'' 
winter just past. 
</P>
<P>
	More rainfall creates greater cover, more shelter and a bigger  
food supply -- nuts, seeds, vegetation and insects -- for rodents. 
That likely means more deer mice, identified as the main culprit in 
the spread of hantavirus. 
</P>
<P>
	Hantavirus is typically caught by breathing dust contaminated  
with a rodent's infected urine, feces or saliva. Experts recommend 
a wet clean-up, using a disinfectant solution. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Bradshaw of Durango, Colo., contracted the disease in 1996  
after sweeping out a mouse-infested building at an electronic tower 
site he owned and then spending the night there. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradshaw said it took months -- and visits to four different  
doctors -- to get a correct diagnosis of the coughing fits, 
blackouts and other symptoms that were making him miserable. 
</P>
<P>
	A 50-year-old former bicycle racer and marathon runner, his  
athletic activities have been severely curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They hope that the lungs regenerate and repair themselves, but  
they're not quite sure they will,'' Bradshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	Early on, hantavirus resembles the flu: fever and muscle aches,  
and sometimes chills, headaches, nausea and vomiting. That makes it 
extremely tough to diagnose on a first visit to a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the more serious symptoms start -- acute respiratory  
problems and fluid buildup in the lungs -- they generally progress 
rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still a really difficult, complicated disease,'' said  
Paul Ettestad, hantavirus epidemiologist with the New Mexico 
Department of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	The strain of hantavirus labeled ``Sin Nombre'' or ``No Name''  
was first recognized in 1993 after a flurry of cases -- 18 in New 
Mexico, 10 in Arizona and five in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, more than 200 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome  
have been confirmed in 30 states -- some of them older, mysterious 
cases that weren't solved until the strain was identified. Of 
those, nearly 45 percent have been fatal.

<HEADLINE> Gant Keeps Spot in Phillies Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Phillies manager Terry Francona  
confronted the hard facts: Ron Gant is batting .233, 100 points 
lower than Mike Lieberthal. Why not switch them in the batting 
order? 
</P>
<P>
	Not yet, says Francona, who is counting on Gant to come out of  
his season-long slump and become the No. 5 hitter the Phillies 
thought they were getting from St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of trying to move Gant, I think we should try to get  
him to hit,'' Francona said Wednesday. ``I don't think we want him 
to hit .228 all season, but he still does things to help this 
ballclub.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gant found himself in the middle of a firestorm during spring  
training, when he exchanged long-distance insults with Tony La 
Russa. The Cardinals manager, miffed that Gant claimed he'd been 
mistreated in St. Louis, said, ``All he ever did for us was whiff, 
whiff, whiff. I really hope he goes to Philly and whiffs for them 
like he whiffed for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a while, it seemed as though La Russa was right.  
</P>
<P>
	But despite his poor average, seven homers and 19 RBIs, Gant has  
shown signs of coming out of it lately. He battled back from an 0-2 
count and delivered a clutch RBI single in the Phillies' 6-5 
extra-inning loss to San Francisco on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Gant also has showed himself to be a vastly improved outfielder,  
throwing out two runners in two innings Monday night and receiving 
an ovation when he got to the dugout. The small but vocal crowds at 
the Vet have been tough on Gant, but not unfair. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not stupid,'' Gant said. ``They know I've been  
contributing, and they appreciate that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gant went into Wednesday night's game against the Giants  
with 41 strikeouts in 159 at-bats. He seems to have an 0-2 count on 
him every time up. While it's worth wondering if Gant's days as a 
middle-of-the-order hitter are over, Francona said he's not giving 
up yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's talk about moving me down, I don't know where that  
comes from,'' Gant said. ``I know what I can do. I just need to 
stay positive and keep progressing like I think I have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lieberthal, a budding star with a .333 average and 10 homers, is  
the natural choice to take Gant's place behind cleanup hitter Rico 
Brogna. He currently bats seventh, but Francona said he doesn't 
want to put pressure on his catcher to produce at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you flip-flop them and Gant's still not hitting,'' Francona  
said, ``what kind of pitches is Lieberthal going to get to hit?''

<HEADLINE> On Show: Homeless Treasures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Like orphans shuttling between relatives,  
Islamic treasures have traveled from one leading museum to another 
across Europe and America for nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Egyptian perfume sprinkler, the Koranic manuscripts, the  
Ottoman rug and other priceless artworks owned by a royal Kuwaiti 
couple have nowhere to settle. Their home, the Kuwait National 
Museum, was burned down by Iraq's invading army in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Kuwait has been reconstructed to its former glitz and  
chrome, but the four-building museum remains a charred wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a shame and an embarrassment. It seems culture is at the  
bottom of the government's priority,'' said Sheika Hussa al-Sabah, 
who owns the artifacts with her husband and had loaned them to the 
museum. Kuwait's emir is the couple's uncle, and they have an 
international real estate empire. 
</P>
<P>
	Fahad al-Wohaibi, director of the National Museum, told The  
Associated Press the government plans to rebuild part of the museum 
as soon as it can allocate the necessary $9.83 million. Kuwait has 
been dealing with unprecedented budget deficits because of low oil 
prices, the seven-month Iraqi occupation and the 1991 Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning admiration on both sides of the Atlantic, the  
al-Sabah exhibition opened in Cairo last month, its debut in an 
Islamic country outside Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	On show until July 6 at Cairo's Mr. and Mrs. Mohammed Khalil  
Museum are some of the rarest and most beautiful artifacts spanning 
11 centuries -- 622-1800 -- of Islamic artistry culled from Spain to 
India. 
</P>
<P>
	Each object tells a historic tale:  
</P>
<P>
	--The jade pendant inscribed with gold was made for the  
17th-century Indian emperor Shah Jahan, who built the Taj Mahal. 
</P>
<P>
	--Two miniature paintings depict Persian king Bahram Gur's  
romance with seven princesses. He is shown visiting the princess of 
Maghrib in the turquoise pavilion on Wednesdays, and cavorting with 
the princess of Iran in the white pavilion on Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
	--A 1,000-year-old glass jug is thought to have adorned an  
Egyptian nobleman's buffet. Stunning in its simplicity, the jar's 
only decoration is on the neck where vertically stamped 
inscriptions repeat the words, ``enjoyable drinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--A unique illustration of a water clock design is from a 1315  
Syrian treatise on the construction of mechanical devices. Sheika 
Hussa and her husband had to sell two London apartments to buy it 
in an auction, outbidding several other institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The varied pieces, separated by time and place, also have a  
collective tale to tell: A more poignant modern story of escape 
from Saddam Hussein's invaders. 
</P>
<P>
	During their seven-month occupation, the Iraqis looted the  
emirate of Kuwait of nearly everything that could be moved -- 
appliances, furniture, clothes, jewelry, food, even bathroom 
fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
	All the Kuwait National Museum's antiquities were carted to  
Baghdad and the building set on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	But just one week before the August 1990 invasion, 107 choice  
pieces from the al-Sabah collection were sent to Russia's State 
Hermitage Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Iraq was forced to retreat, all but 59 of the 20,000  
pieces that were looted were retrieved through U.N. efforts. Twenty 
percent were partially or completely damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	With no place for display, many of the artifacts are being  
exhibited informally in Sheika Hussa's palatial home. Others are in 
storage or being restored. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts have hailed the exhibition as unique in presenting an  
overview of art since the inception of Islam. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives you an idea of the mastery of craft in different  
material that was produced during all the centuries,'' said Lieve 
Vandenbulcke, a UNESCO conservator. She spoke from Kuwait, where 
she is working on damaged artworks. 
</P>
<P>
	Every artifact in the collection was bought by Sheika Hussa and  
her husband, Sheik Nasser Sabah al-Ahmed, from auction houses, 
dealers and the Thieves' Bazaar in Bombay, India. They began in 
1975 with a 14th-century Egyptian glass bottle from the Mameluke 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ever since, it has been an obsession,'' Sheika Hussa said.

<HEADLINE> Michael Jackson's Son Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Michael Jackson is keeping a vigil at the  
bedside of his 2-year-old son who was unconscious after a seizure 
caused by a viral infection. 
</P>
<P>
	Prince Michael Jackson Jr. was stricken over the weekend, said  
Jonathan Morrish, an executive with Sony Records, Jackson's label. 
</P>
<P>
	``Friday night the child ... lost consciousness, and his legs  
and arms were paralyzed because of a high viral fever,'' Morrish 
said Tuesday in Modena, Italy, where Jackson was to have attended a 
benefit concert. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next 24 hours will be decisive for Prince's health,'' he  
told Italian news agency ANSA. ``Michael would have wanted with all 
his heart to be in Modena but as all parents can understand he 
could not leave his son at this moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's wife, Deborah Rowe Jackson, downplayed the reports of  
her son's illness in an interview with KNBC-TV in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's fine. He is not dying. ... He's had a virus infection and  
he's going to be fine,'' she told the station. Mrs. Jackson said 
she was planning to travel to New York to be with the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's horrible to go through,'' she said. ``To hear that your  
child is dying and to find it on the news and it not be true is 
terrifying, especially when I've spoken to his father and he told 
me he was OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson canceled his trip to Italy to stay with his son at an  
undisclosed New York hospital. He was to have shared the stage with 
opera star Luciano Pavarotti. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavarotti reportedly choked back tears as he told the concert  
crowd Tuesday that Jackson's son may be dying. ``It would be best 
if we think of him and send him our prayers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrish said it was the third time Prince has suffered a seizure  
this year. In January, Prince was rushed to a hospital and treated 
for a viral infection accompanied by fever and dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
	Prince was born Feb. 13, 1997. Jackson and his wife had a second  
child, Paris, in April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts by The Associated Press to reach spokesmen for Jackson  
were unsuccessful Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pledges Help in Ark. Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- President Clinton expressed the  
nation's sympathies today to the victims of the American Airlines 
crash near Little Rock, Ark. ``Our government is doing everything 
possible to aid the victims and help determine the cause of this 
tragedy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While flying to Colorado to deliver a commencement address,  
Clinton phoned Little Rock Mayor Jim Dailey for an update on the 
crash, said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Dailey told Clinton that the crash scene gave him ``an  
awesome sense of the fragileness of life,'' adding, ``It was a 
miracle there weren't more deaths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton replied, ``If there's anything we can do, just let us  
know. We're thinking about you and praying for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said Clinton learned that a friend, Nancy Wood, was on  
board the flight with her husband. Both survived. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also issued a statement saying he and first lady Hillary  
Rodham Clinton were saddened by news of the crash. He said family 
assistance counselors and others were helping the National 
Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration 
inspectors at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``We join the American people in extending our deepest  
sympathies to the families of those who died or were injured,'' 
Clinton said. ``I ask all Americans to remember in their prayers 
the passengers and their families.''

<HEADLINE> Stonecutter Mills Closing 2 Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPINDALE, N.C. (AP) -- Stonecutter Mills Inc. plans to close its  
plants in Rutherford and Polk counties and its office in New York 
on July 12, eliminating about 800 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a death of a family,'' Jim Cowan, the Spindale-based  
company's chief executive, said yesterday. ``People who have worked 
together for nearly 80 years. It is hard. No one expected this. Not 
even me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stonecutter officials blame the North American Free Trade  
Agreement and a sharp downturn in new orders for the closings. 
NAFTA was established more than two years ago to eliminate trade 
barriers among the United States, Mexico and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rutherford County and Polk County manufacturing jobs are  
going to Mexico, Cowan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stonecutter Mills' other businesses will continue to operate,  
Cowan said. The other operations, which employ 174 people, include 
Henson Timber, Mitchell Fabrics, Stonecutter Trucking and an 
engineering division. 
</P>
<P>
	Stonecutter is the third major textile plant owner to close  
mills since January. Dan River Inc. closed its doors in January, 
followed by the shutdown of Burlington Industries' J.C. Cowan plant 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Cone Mills announced the layoff of 438 salaried and  
hourly employees.

Serv-A-Portion of Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deals announced Wednesday were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	Thermo Pac of Stone Mountain employs 160 at a factory in Atlanta  
manufacturing single-serve packets of food to foodservice and 
grocery customers throughout the U.S. It had been a privately-held

</P>
<P>
	Serv-A-Portion specializes in manufacturing jams and sauces,  
exporting more than 85 percent of its products to European markets 
from its factory in Turnhout, where 110 people work. It acquired 
Serv-A-Portion from Medeol, the consumer products division of 
agro-foods company Eridania Beghin-Say.

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Roy Rogers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRANSON, Mo. (AP) -- It was a different time entirely, says Dusty  
Rogers, recalling those years right after World War II, when he was 
growing up. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a time when America seemed to produce heroes in droves,  
and of truly heroic proportions -- heroes who didn't get caught in 
fast cars filled with drugs or in hotel rooms filled with fast 
women. Heroes who kept their hair the same color every year, until 
it either fell out or decided to change shades on its own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're ever going to see that time again. That's  
a time long gone, and it's a very special time,'' Rogers muses. ``I 
thank God every day that I grew up in that time zone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was an age, this 52-year-old cowboy singer recalls joyfully,  
when every little boy wanted to grow up to be a big cowboy hero: a 
Gene Autry or a Lone Ranger. Maybe even a Roy Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's exactly who he was, Roy Rogers Jr., the eldest son of  
the ``king of the cowboys'' -- which didn't always make life in the 
1950s easy for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got thrown out of kindergarten twice for fighting with Gene  
Autry fans,'' he says, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also got to live life up close and personal with the king  
of the cowboys, watching his father ride and rope and catch bad 
guys on television and in the movies. And he listened as his father 
recorded hundreds of songs with his group, the Sons of the 
Pioneers, and other Western musicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Songs like ``Roll Along Prairie Moon,'' ``Happy Trails,''  
``Ridin' Down the Canyon,'' ``Cool Water,'' ``Tumblin' 
Tumbleweeds.'' Songs that would land the elder Rogers in the 
Country Music Hall of Fame, not once but twice, both as an 
individual and a member of the Sons of the Pioneers, the first 
country musician so honored. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, nearly a year after his death at age 87, the rest of the  
world can hear 94 of the songs in a four-CD set, ``King of the 
Cowboys: The Roy Rogers Box,'' from the archival record label, 
Rhino. 
</P>
<P>
	The collection is heavy on transcriptions of old radio show  
broadcasts, auditions and live performances never before released. 
They trace Rogers' singing career from its beginnings in the 1930s 
into the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dad never threw anything away,'' Rogers says in an interview  
from the Roy Rogers-Dale Evans Museum in Victorville, Calif., which 
is named for his father and stepmother. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why we have a museum here,'' he continues with a  
chuckle. ``Because he never threw anything away. And we've got all 
these recordings here, and they're in pristine condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His father, he says, helped put the track list together when the  
project began. It shows how his style developed over the years from 
simple, acoustic music to more of a big-band, Western swing sound, 
progressing again in the 1990s, when he would work with such 
modern-day country stars as Clint Black, Randy Travis, Willie 
Nelson and Emmylou Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	And it shows that while many a childhood fan might have tuned in  
a Roy Rogers TV show or gone to a movie mainly to see the riding 
and the roping, this guy really could sing. 
</P>
<P>
	He may have been, as Dale Warren, leader of the Sons of the  
Pioneers, insists, one of the great yodelers of all time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jimmie Rodgers was one of his idols years ago,'' Warren  
recalls, mentioning music's singing brakeman, the master of the 
``Blue Yodel'' songs. 
</P>
<P>
	``But where he really started to yodel was back there in Ohio,  
on the farm where he grew up, where he would be way out in the 
hills or working on the fields and his sisters and him would yodel 
back and forth. That's how they'd hear each other and keep in 
touch. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had his own style,'' Warren continues. ``He brought little  
tricks into it that only he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like yodeling in three-part harmony, something that only the  
Sons of the Pioneers did. And which the group, now in its 65th year 
and in the midst of its annual eight-month run in Branson, 
continues to do. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the Pioneers also have their own special tribute to  
Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our first year that he won't be here for us to talk to  
or visit with or to come to the theater and see us here in 
Branson,'' says Warren, 73, who has been with the group 47 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd surprise us a lot,'' he continues quietly, recalling a  
memory now bittersweet. ``He'd just come in and sit down and 
someone would say, `Roy's sitting out there in the audience.''' 
</P>
<P>
	So instead, the group will bring the memory of those days alive  
when it opens each concert with an old Roy Rogers movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``People will get a chance to see those old movies like they  
used to for a dime when they were kids,'' says Warren. 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets will cost more than that, of course, ``But we're going  
to try to at least keep the popcorn at a dime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than just prices have changed over the years, however. And  
because of that, Warren doesn't envision another Roy Rogers ever 
riding down the trail. 
</P>
<P>
	He recalls fondly how Rogers would open a state-fair show by  
racing like the wind into an arena atop Trigger, his golden 
palomino, in a moment so transcendent that people who come to Sons 
of the Pioneers shows to this day still talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, you might have somebody come along and be just as big. But  
it wouldn't be the same,'' says Warren. ``There's Garth Brooks, 
George Strait, Clint Black, and all of them today. And they all 
wear cowboy hats and sing. But it's not the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But as long as those old records and movies exist, Warren can  
hardly imagine a time when people won't smile in recognition at the 
mention of the name Roy Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a bunch of young fellows from New Jersey to the show  
just last week -- eight or 10 of them out on spring break,'' he 
says.

<HEADLINE> Beaches Report a Lack of Lifeguards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Sun, sand and scenery apparently aren't enough  
anymore. As prime beach season approaches, swimming areas around 
the country are finding it unusually difficult to fill lifeguard 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the worst I've seen in the last 12 years,'' said Shawn  
DeRosa, who coordinates beach programs for the state of 
Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts has filled just 65 percent of its 420 lifeguarding  
jobs, and some Long Island beaches were closed over the Memorial 
Day weekend because there weren't enough guards. Hampton Beach, 
N.H., hasn't received enough applicants this year to fill its 36 
openings. 
</P>
<P>
	In Myrtle Beach, S.C., the lack of interest in 30 available jobs  
baffles folks who remember when hundreds annually applied. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sign of society,'' said Tony Blackburn, general manager  
at John's Beach Service, a contractor that supplies guards. ``Kids 
get out of high school and they don't want to do anything that 
resembles work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It used to be that lifeguarding didn't resemble real work to  
many people. But in recent years, the training has taken on a more 
serious tone, more appropriate to the safety mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Guards in most states are now required to be certified in CPR  
and other lifesaving techniques for jobs that pay about $7 to $10 
an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Other summer work offers the same pay without the life-and-death  
pressure, said Laura Slane, associate director of aquatics at the 
YMCA's national headquarters in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	And many job seekers are taking advantage of a tight labor  
market, with students turning to career-related internships that 
look better on a resume than a summer at the beach, DeRosa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the staffing shortages, some beaches have focused  
their staffs on the most densely occupied areas, leaving stretches 
unguarded. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is more of a risk,'' DeRosa said.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, in places like Los Angeles where the glamour -- and $18 an  
hour -- eclipse most other beaches, there is no shortage of 
applicants. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Mickey Gallagher of the Los Angeles County Fire Department  
Lifeguard Operations said the lifeguarding units are comparable to 
firefighting battalions, with rescue boats and four-wheel drive 
vehicles.

<HEADLINE> Mexico, U.S. Discuss NAFTA Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) -- Sewage leaks. Traffic-clogged roads.  
Housing shortages. These are issues normally dealt with by city 
councils, not cabinet secretaries and congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
	But high-level U.S. and Mexican officials started a two-day  
meeting here Wednesday to discuss such negative aspects of the 
North America Free Trade Agreement and the business opportunities 
available for those willing to resolve them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think NAFTA has been very good for both the U.S. and  
Mexico,'' U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson told a group of 
reporters in Spanish. ``It has brought jobs and a huge amount of 
progress to the border, but ... now we're dealing with the problems 
of traffic and the environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson was joined at the U.S.-Mexico Border Infrastructure  
Conference by U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley, California 
Gov. Gray Davis, Mexico Trade Minister Herminio Blanco and San 
Diego Congressman Bob Filner. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials did not criticize NAFTA, which is credited with  
helping to double cross-border trade since 1993. But leaders from 
both sides say the booming economy it has created also is straining 
the basic infrastructure linking the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference focuses on ways the government and private  
businesses can improve or build roads, bridges, wastewater 
treatment plants and utilities along the 2,000-mile border 
stretching from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley announced a federal grant of nearly $870,000 to expand  
roads at the Otay Mesa border crossing in San Diego County, where 
trucks back up every day entering and leaving Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also a groundbreaking ceremony for the expansion of a  
sewage treatment plant in Tijuana, a $20 million project funded by 
both counties. 
</P>
<P>
	Another issue is the housing shortage in Tijuana, Blanco said.  
Mexicans who travel to Baja California looking for work at the 
dozens of maquiladoras, the border factories created by NAFTA, 
often can't find a place to live. The population of Tijuana has 
grown to more than 1 million people, but available housing hasn't 
kept pace. Many people are forced to live in makeshift, hillside 
shacks, he said. Daley said he hopes the conference will entice 
construction and energy companies to invest in the region. The 
meeting was attended by several hundred business leaders from both 
sides of the border. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis mentioned two San Diego-based companies that have already  
committed to spending $1 billion each in Mexico over the next five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sempra Energy plans to provide natural gas to businesses and  
homes in the border region, while Leap Wireless International is 
working with Pegaaso PCS to establish a national wireless phone 
network in Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Dwarfs Gain Cosmic Respect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Too massive to be planets and too cold to be  
stars, five stellar wannabes are finally earning some cosmic 
respect. 
</P>
<P>
	The recently discovered gaseous objects fall into a new category  
below stars and above planets, said Davy Kirkpatrick, staff 
scientist at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center at NASA's 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're kind of a hybrid between planets and stars -- sort of a  
missing link in the astronomical world,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The news was announced Tuesday by astronomers who are surveying  
the sky with telescopes that detect heat emitted from stars and 
galaxies hidden from view by interstellar dust. 
</P>
<P>
	Typical brown dwarfs, so named because of their relative size  
and darkness, do not have enough mass to start the nuclear fusion 
engine that powers stars like the sun. Even though they're called 
cool, they still generate some heat from collapsing gases. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, even among brown dwarfs, the five new objects are  
unusually cool. Scientists detected the presence of methane, a gas 
that only forms at less than 1,652 degrees Fahrenheit -- just four 
times the temperature of a typical kitchen oven. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ones we're seeing are really the coolest objects of the  
bunch,'' Kirkpatrick said. ``Because (the methane dwarfs) are so 
cool, they're able to form molecules in their own atmosphere, 
unlike stars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jupiter-size objects also are not associated with nearby  
stars and appear to be ``lost in space,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The methane brown dwarfs, estimated to be about 30 light years  
from Earth, are located in the constellations Leo, Virgo and Corvus 
and the Big Dipper area of Ursa Major. They cannot be seen with a 
naked eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because our telescopes can only see the closest examples, this  
means the Milky Way must be brimming with objects like these,'' 
Kirkpatrick said. 
</P>
<P>
	The brown dwarfs were discovered while researchers analyzed data  
gathered by telescopes in Arizona and Chile as part of the 
Two-Micron All Sky Survey, a project sponsored by NASA and the 
National Science Foundation.

<HEADLINE> Penguins Look To Up Season Tix Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Step right up, hockey fans, and lay down money  
for tickets for games that might not even happen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pittsburgh Penguins, now operating with protection from  
creditors, could be moved to another city before the summer. Even 
so, the team is making a push to sell 12,000 season tickets and 
trying to capitalize on civic pride. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very ambitious goal,'' David Andrews, the Penguins'  
chief operating officer, said Tuesday. ``But we hope to create a 
groundswell to demonstrate to the National Hockey League and to 
potential buyers Mario Lemieux and SMG-Fox that there is tremendous 
fan support for the Pens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans who buy the tickets won't lose their money if the team  
moves. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz last week allowed the  
team to set up an escrow account to protect the money from 
creditors. If the Penguins move to another city, ticket buyers will 
get their money back. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999-2000 season opens in October, but the team wants to  
sell as many season tickets as possible by June 24, a date 
Markovitz has set for deciding who will buy the team. 
</P>
<P>
	That way ``all fans, not just the creditors, will get a chance  
to vote, demonstrating the community is behind the team and the new 
ownership,'' Andrews wrote in a letter to city officials last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 8,300 season tickets were sold. If fans buy 12,000  
season tickets this year, the team will have an easier time selling 
out the 17,000-seat Civic Arena for every home game. 
</P>
<P>
	Team managers settled on 12,000 because that is the number of  
season-ticket commitments required by the NHL from a city that 
wants an expansion franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	The team, which has hired a public relations firm to help in the  
ticket-selling effort, will allow fans to reserve a season-ticket 
plan for $25, then send in at least 10 percent of the cost within a 
month, said Penguins spokesman Tom McMillan. 
</P>
<P>
	Three plans to buy the team have been submitted to the judge.  
Two plans, one from former star center Lemieux and one from arena 
landlord SMG Inc. and broadcaster Fox Sports Net Pittsburgh, would 
keep the team in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Another from the NHL would either dissolve the team and auction  
player contracts or sell the team to one buyer -- reportedly Seattle 
billionaire Paul Allen -- who would move it to another city. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a community, we must take a stand against the NHL and their  
efforts to move or dissolve the Penguins,'' Andrews wrote. ``There 
is no more demonstrable way of doing so than by undertaking a 
measurable show of support, one that even the NHL will be forced to 
acknowledge.''

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Mostly Lower / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly  
lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade after the government 
reported spring crops are in excellent condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Agriculture Department reported corn crops were nearly  
completely planted, and 75 percent were in good to excellent 
condition. Losses were limited, however, amid heavy rainfall in the 
Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures found support amid forecasts for warmer weather  
in growing areas next week that could stress young crops. But 
prices were pressured by speedy planting of what is expected to be 
record acreage. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat fell from harvesting pressure.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 1/4 cent to $2.51 1/2 a bushel; July  
corn rose 1/4 cent to $2.16 1/2 a bushel; July oats fell 1/2 cent to 
$1.21 1/4 a bushel; July soybeans fell 1 1/4 cents to $4.56 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle and lean hog futures were mixed on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. Feeder cattle retreated, while pork bellies 
rose. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose .07 cent to 64.57 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .22 cent to 75.65 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
fell .52 cent to 50.95 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose .35 
cent to 53.05 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mostly Down; Dow Off 50.98 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower today as investors,  
increasingly worried about inflation, began preparing for a 
possible rise in interest rates when the Federal Reserve meets 
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 50.98 at 10,545.28. The index fell as much as 131.40 points 
earlier in the session, but regained some ground as investors 
sought bargains in the battered market. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed after spending much of the  
session in negative territory. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was 
down 1.73 at 1,292.53, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 6.18 
at 2,418.21. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks began their decline this morning as traders awaited a  
speech by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan at an international business 
conference in Boston. The market has been rattled for more than two 
weeks by persistent fears that the Fed will soon raise interest 
rates to cool off the booming economy. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Dow closed up 36.52 at 10,596.26 after falling  
as much as 150 points earlier in the session. 
</P>
<P>
	As Greenspan kept his remarks focused on trade, the Dow remained  
in a fairly narrow range. Market watchers, however, strained to 
catch any hints he might offer about the Fed's future course. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward Jones of St.  
Louis, said the market expects the Fed to raise interest rates when 
its Open Market Committee meets June 29. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed doesn't want to shock the system, so Greenspan's  
lieutenants have been warming us up for a while,'' he said. 
``People are selling on the rumor of a rate hike, so they may buy 
when the news hits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices continued their tumble, although the price of the  
benchmark 30-year Treasury bond recovered slightly by early 
afternoon. The 30-year bond was yielding 5.94 percent, down from 
5.97 in earlier trading. A yield of 6 percent is viewed as a 
critical point for stocks, because at that level, yields make bonds 
a more attractive investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest rate worries depressed bank and financial stocks today,  
with J.P. Morgan falling 3 1/2 at 130. The financial sector is 
especially vulnerable to higher interest rates because lending 
volume shrinks when it becomes more expensive to borrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet companies also tumbled until their weakened prices  
enticed some buyers. America Online dropped sharply in early 
trading, but is now up 1 1/2 at 114 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Online brokerages, however, mirrored their more conventional  
rivals and were mostly lower. DLJ Direct fell 3 3/4 to 35. 
</P>
<P>
	Bookseller Barnes &AMP; Noble rose 11/16 to 28 1/16 after it called  
off its planned acquisition of book distributor Ingram Book Group. 
The company's online wing, barnesandnoble.com, fell 3 to 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 581.7 million shares, 
ahead of Tuesday's quiet pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 1.62 at 619.66, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 6.65 at 769.46.

<HEADLINE> FBI Probes Iraq Businessman's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- The FBI is investigating the  
international connections of a prominent Iraqi-American who was 
murdered along with his wife and 16-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears they were targeted,'' police spokeswoman Katie  
Hughes said Tuesday. ``We're not alluding to who would have 
targeted them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police alerted by an anonymous call Friday found the bodies of  
Fuad Khazi Taima, 63; his wife, Dorothy Mae, 54; and son, Leith, in 
their home in McLean, a Washington suburb. All had died of 
gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no sign of forced entry and it was not a  
murder-suicide or robbery, Ms. Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taima traveled frequently to Iraq, and the FBI was called in  
because of his international dealings, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police believe the three may have been killed May 26. Taima's  
wife was an English teacher and their son a sophomore at McLean 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither police nor the FBI would cite any motive for the  
killings, and neither would comment on news reports that they were 
looking into whether the crime involved either the Iraqi government 
or its opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Taima was founder of the American-Iraqi Foundation, aimed at  
improving U.S.-Iraqi relations during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post reported Tuesday that Taima had told  
colleagues he recently visited Iraq and landed a large business 
deal. Details of the reported deal were not immediately known. The 
Post said he had worked as a consultant in oil and high technology 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahmed Chalabi, the Washington representative of the opposition  
Iraqi National Congress, would not speculate on who killed Taima 
but said the murders fit the pattern of killings carried out by 
Iraqi government agents. 
</P>
<P>
	There usually is no sign of forced entry or a struggle because  
someone familiar to a victim usually is sent in first, Chalabi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was available to comment on the case Tuesday at the Iraqi  
Mission to the United Nations, a secretary said.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Reviews Internet Phone Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- State regulators may want more time to  
decide on a rate shift in Internet telephone charges, a proposal 
that could lead to higher fees for some Internet users in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	A plan pushed by Pacific Bell to shift connection fees for such  
calls to a smaller phone company, which could pass them along to 
Internet service providers, had been scheduled for a vote at 
today's Public Utilities Commission meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	But the sponsor, Josiah Neeper, changed his proposal before the  
meeting so that it would require a full review and public comment 
before final PUC action, said Pacific Bell spokesman Bill Mashek. 
</P>
<P>
	Some legislators have urged the commission to postpone action  
and allow more time for a full debate on the effects on Internet 
charges and access. 
</P>
<P>
	A delay would also give Gov. Gray Davis more time to fill two  
vacancies on the five-member PUC, whose three current members were 
appointed by former Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission voted 3-2 last October to maintain its current  
system, which treats Internet calls as local calls and requires 
Pacific Bell to pay a fee for their completion under its contracts 
with small phone companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But the terms of two commissioners, also Wilson appointees, have  
since expired. Both voted with the majority in October. 
</P>
<P>
	The eventual decision could set a precedent for other carriers  
that serve 600 Internet service providers in California. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute involves Internet calls that start with the caller's  
local carrier, a field dominated by Pacific Bell. The call is 
passed along to the Internet service provider's carrier, typically 
a smaller company like Pac-West Telcomm, whose case was before the 
PUC today. 
</P>
<P>
	For handling the remainder of the call, Pacific Bell has been  
required, under past agreements, to pay a fee to Pac-West. 
</P>
<P>
	That arrangement was designed for the expected increase in  
competition among local carriers. When Internet traffic flourished 
among small phone companies, Pacific Bell protested that the fees 
were an improper subsidy and that the calls, often destined for 
remote Web sites, were long-distance calls for which no fee was 
required. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacific Bell started withholding its fee from Pac-West two years  
ago and has built up $50 million in an escrow account while the PUC 
considers its appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Bryson, chief financial officer of Stockton-based Pac-West,  
has said his company would have to increase rates to Internet 
service providers if it lost the Pacific Bell fees. 
</P>
<P>
	After last October's PUC vote to leave the interconnection fees  
intact, the Federal Communications Commission weighed in by 
declaring in January that Internet calls were long-distance. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the FCC specified that Internet callers would not have  
to pay long-distance rates and that state regulatory agencies 
remained free to allocate costs between the companies.

<HEADLINE> Murder Mystery Shocks R.I. Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE COMPTON, R.I. (AP) -- Angela Spence-Shaw was struck on the  
head. Then the 66-year-old grandmother, clad in her nightgown, was 
dumped into her full bathtub. A plugged-in hair dryer was dropped 
into the water to electrocute her in case she had survived the 
beating. 
</P>
<P>
	The killer didn't bother to turn off the faucet, and by the time  
a friend found Mrs. Spence-Shaw's corpse the next morning, water 
was streaming down her dirt driveway. She apparently was killed 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	For a peaceful place that hadn't seen a murder in 34 years, a  
classic New England fishing and farming town with one general store 
and an inn, it's like an Agatha Christie novel or an episode of 
``Murder She Wrote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are trying to determine whether Mrs. Spence-Shaw,  
a widow who lived alone, died from the beating, drowned or was 
electrocuted. They said they have not been able to determine a 
motive. 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Harold Watson, No. 2 official of the state police, said  
there were no obvious signs of robbery. He said relatives will be 
asked to see if anything is missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are not saying whether a weapon was used in the  
beating or whether there was a struggle. The woman's two golden 
retrievers were unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The bucolic, seaside town is considered one of the safest  
communities in Rhode Island.

	Mrs. Spence-Shaw and her husband, Peter VanCleve Shaw, moved  
here several years ago from Norton, Mass., where he had operated a 
store. He was active in local government; she was an avid gardener 
and got a job at a greenhouse. He died in 1991.

	Last Saturday, Mrs. Spence-Shaw drove to Bristol for dinner with  
her son and his family. The next morning, a co-worker became

	``Everybody is very upset, very concerned about who would have  
done it,'' Cabot said.
