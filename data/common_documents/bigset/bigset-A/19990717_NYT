SECOND JONES HOMER SAVES GAME FOR MADDU
</HEADLINE>
   (ko) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   There were 50,469 fans at a raucous and cammy Yankee Stadium
Friday night, and Andruw Jones acted as if he had heard each one.
Every time the fans booed, Jones listened. He let the sounds drift
through his ears and motivate him. He wanted to quiet these rowdy
fans.
</P>
<P>
   So when Jones batted with the score tied and two runners on base
in the ninth inning, he finally had his chance to silence Yankee
Stadium. And he did. Mariano Rivera tried to throw a high inside
fastball past Jones, who blasted it over the left field fence to
vault the Braves to a wild 10-7 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to beat them so bad because of their fans,'' said
Jones. ``They think they're putting pressure on us. We know they're
a good team too. There's nothing wrong with thinking we could play
them in the post-season, too.''
</P>
<P>
   On a back-and-forth night when Greg Maddux was bounced from the
game in the fourth inning and Orlando Hernandez left in the fifth,
the Braves rallied for four runs in the ninth off the struggling
Rivera. Jones climaxed the nifty comeback with his second homer of
the game, duplicating what he accomplished against the Yankees as a
19-year-old in Game 1 of the 1996 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things are in the past,'' said Jones. ``Maybe when I
retire, they'll show it and my kids will see it. I'll tell them,
`That's what your dad did. He hit two homers in the World Series.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux was relieved that Jones saved the Braves. With the sweat
dripping off his face, his eyes focused on his cleats and his
tongue probably wanting to bark objections to umpire Jim Evans,
Maddux trudged off the mound in the fourth because his brief and
ugly night was over. Maddux heard a thunderous mixture of boos and
sarcastic cheers as the fans serenaded the precise pitcher who was
very imprecise.
</P>
<P>
   There was some suspense about whether Maddux would say something
to Evans, but he never even glanced at him. Maybe Maddux was too
exasperated or simply had nothing to utter. It was a disastrous
night for the 33-year old pitcher who said on Thursday that Yankee
Stadium was a cool and fun place to play. After Maddux was blitzed
for five earned runs on nine hits in three and a third innings, his
shortest outing in almost three years, he was not feeling cool
because he had had no fun.
</P>
<P>
   The most frustrating part of Maddux's start occurred with one
out and the bases loaded in the fourth. Maddux uncorked a 1-2
fastball to Scott Brosius that missed the outside corner by a few
inches. Maddux obviously thought it was close enough to be a
strike, he complained to himself about the pitch, and Evans walked
toward him and waved his finger at the four-time Cy Young Award
winner.
</P>
<P>
   While manager Bobby Cox asked Evans why he confronted the
pitcher, Maddux wiped the sweat off his forehead and later said
that he did not even notice that Evans had pointed at him. On the
next pitch, Brosius chopped a ball off a leaping Maddux's glove
that narrowly slithered into center field to score two runs and put
the Yankees in front, 4-3. Maddux was perturbed and mumbled
something near Evans after backing up the play. ``That's a ball
that just missed,'' said Maddux. ``That's what's frustrating. The
strike zone was all right. It was a lot more me than him.''
</P>
<P>
   While Maddux struggled with the new strike zone earlier this
season, he was 5-1 with a 0.86 earned run average in his last six
starts and had seemingly made the proper adjustments. That
impressive streak ended abruptly in the fourth when Derek Jeter's
run-scoring single boosted New York's lead to 5-3 and sent Maddux
searching for soap and shampoo.
</P>
<P>
   The forgettable 3 1/3 innings was Maddux's shortest outing since
the Braves removed him after two innings against the Expos on Sept.
28, 1996 to set up their post-season rotation. The last time Maddux
was knocked out of a contest this early because of shoddy pitching
was on June 7, 1996, when he gave up 7 runs and 11 hits to
Colorado. But Maddux got to stand in a victorious clubhouse because
Jones went deep and quieted more than 50,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big win for us,'' said Maddux. ``We beat a really
good closer. I'm happy for Andruw. That was a good hit.''

THREE PBS STATIONS ADMIT SHARING DONOR LISTS WITH DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At least three public television stations in the
nation's largest markets say they have been sharing donor lists
with Democratic fund-raising groups, a practice that may be legal
but one that some congressional Republicans suggest could
jeopardize public financing of all public television and radio
stations.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting have
condemned the practice and said Friday that they were trying to
determine its extent in preparation for a congressional hearing set
for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Public television stations in New York, Washington and Boston
acknowledged that they had sold or swapped donor lists with
Democratic groups in the past, but added that they had stopped
doing so and fired those who were responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The admissions by the stations _ WNET in New York, WGBH in
Boston and WETA in Washington _ have angered Republicans on Capitol
Hill, who view them as confirmation of long-held convictions that
public television leans to the political left and should not be
financed with tax dollars. The federal government provides about 15
percent of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting's $200 billion
annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   Nonprofit organizations are prohibited from engaging in
political activity. But the Internal Revenue Service says that such
organizations can sell or rent their mailing lists to candidates or
parties if they makes the lists available to all candidates and
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the stations said that, in some cases, they had
made their lists available to both Democratic and Republican
groups. But they said they were concerned about possible
misperceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that our viewers and listeners could reasonably
interpret as a partisan act, we shouldn't engage in,'' said Robert
T. Coonrod, president of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
``The health of public broadcasting is built on the trust we have
with our viewers and listeners, and anything we do that might erode
that trust is just not smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Coonrod said the practice of list-swapping was common in
industry, but that it was not common with political organizations.
He said the corporation did not condone the practice.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Collins, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee,
said that his organization had ``never leased a public broadcasting
list,'' but he said that in rare cases it had used lists from
charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's reckless,'' he said. ``It puts these public broadcasters
in a very embarrassing position with regard to their donors and a
dangerous one with regard to the IRS.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Backus, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National
Committee, said the practice of list-swapping was common and that
the television stations had done nothing unusual. She said the list
broker employed by the DNC had provided a list of 123 organizations
from which the committee had selected 62, including WGBH.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any way of knowing that WGBH had an internal
policy against this,'' she said. ``This is standard practice
conducted on the open market.''
</P>
<P>
   But many public stations prohibit work with political
organizations. WNYC, the public radio station in New York, is one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't make our list available to political organizations,''
said Ted Roebuck, a WNYC spokesman. ``We have to turn down those
requests pretty often, and just last week we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about list-swapping were first raised when The Boston
Globe reported in May that WGBH had exchanged membership lists with
the Democratic National Committee on two occasions _ a move that
Republicans said initially appeared to be isolated. But as of
Thursday, officials at public stations in New York and Washington
acknowledged that they, too, had shared their fund-raising lists.
</P>
<P>
   Stella Giammasi, a spokeswoman for WNET in New York, said that
an internal investigation revealed ``that without our knowledge and
through some misinterpretation of our policy, the list brokers we
employ had made our list available to both Democratic and
Republican organizations,'' which she would not name. ``We can only
guess this was done as a purely commercial gesture. It did not
reflect station policy, and they were fired,'' she said. She would
not name the list broker.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Giammasi said there had been more than one instance of
list-swapping but the matter was still being investigated. Still,
she sought to assure the station's donors that their names were not
being sold for political purposes by noting that donors are given
the chance to ``opt out'' of having their names given to other
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Giammasi acknowledged that this still posed a political
problem for public stations in general. ``We're always worried
about our funding,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans came to power four years ago attacking public
broadcasting as liberal and elitist and promising to eliminate
federal contributions. But broad public support for programs like
``Sesame Street'' helped silence Republican hostility.
</P>
<P>
   As Ken Johnson, a spokesman for Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La.,
chairman of a subcommittee that oversees public broadcasting, put
it: ``From a practical political standpoint, it was a public
relations nightmare for Republicans to talk about shoveling dirt on
Big Bird.''

FOE OF HATE GROUPS SAYS LACK OF HELP FORCED HER INTO HIDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE BARBER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A year ago, Bonnie Jouhari was battling hate groups in
Pennsylvania, working for fair housing and involved in an
unprecedented state lawsuit that banned a hate group from the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the 42-year-old single mom and her 17-year-old daughter
are living in limbo _ hiding in the Seattle area and hoping to
escape continued harassment from those who see her as ``a race
traitor.''
</P>
<P>
   While she's lost everything, Jouhari said, she's most troubled
by what she considers foot-dragging by the Justice Department, a
one-time ally that has left her feeling vulnerable and betrayed for
the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the government is really serious about civil
rights,'' said Jouhari. ``If they were, they would file the case
they took over in Pennsylvania last year that we were involved in.
Since they haven't, we can't qualify for protection to help us get
our lives together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, it just sends the wrong message'' to hate groups, and
to people who stand up against racism, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jouhari said she wanted to stay out of the public spotlight in
Washington state for her daughter's sake. But frustrated with the
government, she phoned the Post-Intelligencer for help after the
harassment started here last month.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials declined to comment on the case, other than to
say the investigation is still active.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Wassmuth, head of the Northwest Coalition Against
Malicious Harassment, said he is familiar with Jouhari's case and
his group is ``going to try to help her in any we can.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an example of the kind of intrusion into people's
lives that'' that white supremacists are committing, he said. ``We
in government and in society need to do a better job of standing
together with those who are victimized.''
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania is home to more organized hate groups than any
other state, Penn State professors Colin Flint and Lorraine Dowler
recently reported as part of a long-term research project for the
state's Human Relations Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Jouhari, a Navy veteran with a degree in criminal psychology,
was a fair housing specialist for the Reading-Berks County Human
Relations Council in eastern Pennsylvania when her troubles began.
</P>
<P>
   Active and outspoken, she organized a workshop on how the
Internet was being used to recruit members of hate groups and to
intimidate enemies. Then she found herself a target.
</P>
<P>
   After she appeared on a local television program about hate
groups in Berks County in early 1998, Jouhari's picture appeared on
the web site of a Philadelphia-based white supremacist group called
Alpha HQ, according to court documents. Alpha HQ describes itself
as ``the racial, political/paramilitary arm of the Aryan people.''
</P>
<P>
   A caption next to Jouhari's picture on the website said she had
``received warnings in the mail that she is a race traitor and
should beware. Traitors like this should beware, for in our day,
they will be hung from the neck from the nearest tree or
lamppost.''
</P>
<P>
   The website also pictured the Human Relations Council building
as though it were being blown up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next eight months, we endured hell,'' Jouhari said.
Dead flowers were sprinkled over her car. Flyers branding her a
race traitor were left at her door. Anonymous callers told her to
write a will. The head of the local KKK hung around her office,
taking her picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It annoyed me but didn't scare me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But when members of the hate group learned that Jouhari's
daughter, Dani, is bi-racial, ``they had a field day,'' Jouhari
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she decided to move when her daughter received a call
warning that ``they could get to both of us whenever they wanted
to.''
</P>
<P>
   As Jouhari prepared to leave the state, Pennsylvania Attorney
General Mike Fisher filed an unprecedented civil suit against Alpha
HQ, accusing the group of publishing terroristic threats, ethnic
intimidation and harassing messages.
</P>
<P>
   The state won by default in December when the defendants failed
to show up in court, but Jouhari wasn't around to celebrate _ she
and Dani were living quietly in Silverdale, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS-TV cameraman from Washington had recommended the Kitsap
County suburb when the two met during taping of a ``48 Hours''
program about her that aired last October.
</P>
<P>
   Jouhari and Dani could have been eligible for Pennsylvania's
victim and witness protection program some months ago, but they are
now caught in a Catch 22: The state cannot help because federal
authorities have taken over the case, and federal officials say
they can't do anything to shield her until the investigation is
complete and charges are filed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jouhari is stuck: She'd like to rent a place under an
assumed name to escape the harassment, but no landlords would allow
it.
</P>
<P>
   And she'd like to work, but she can't fill out applications
without giving an address that could be traced.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania authorities have done what they can, ruling that
fleeing from hate groups is a valid reason to leave a job. Calling
her decision to quit ``based on factors which were real,
substantial, and reasonable,'' Pennsylvania awarded her
unemployment benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Jouhari, who said she has turned down offers of pay to appear on
tabloid TV shows, said she'd doesn't want publicity or money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to work and do what other people do. I want to
find a way to get an apartment without using my name, and to get a
job. This is about safety,'' she said. ``And when Dani is grown and
away in college, I want to get back into fighting racism.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal Housing and Urban Development administration where
Jouhari worked was making its own case against hate groups last
year, based on threats Jouhari received at her home. The case
seemed to be percolating along until the Justice Department took
over, Jouhari said.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Justice Department, FBI and U.S.
Marshal's office in Washington, D.C., referred questions to one
another Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokeswoman in Washington said Jouhari's
case is still being developed. Local offices in Seattle can't help,
however, because the case is being handled in Philadelphia, where
no one was available for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Jouhari's local friends, meanwhile, are trying to get
high ranking elected officials involved. Tova Ravitz, spokeswoman
for Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said the senator was unaware of the
case but ``would love to be helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Jouhari said she feels secure in the fellowship of a
local church that has provided her with a place to live, but prays
someone in authority helps her soon. She and her daughter moved
from Silverdale late last month after the threats found them again
_ hangup phone calls and cryptic messages, a dead rabbit left on
their stoop.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter from her hometown newspaper apparently let slip to a
local Klansman where Jouhari had gone, she said. A former reporter
from the newspaper confirmed that account.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been easy for her 17-year-old daughter. A gifted
student, Dani had been involved in student council and volleyball
at her high school. She said she left behind a boyfriend, a nice
job and ``all our little treasures,'' during the quick move in late
November from Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I didn't want to come here,'' Dani said. ``We had no
money even for a tree at Christmas. I missed 45 days of school last
year and didn't take my SAT exams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave up everything. Now it's a big treat for us to go to
the store to get food.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dani said she's proud of her mom, although the move created
some tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blamed my mom at one point but she's not the one who is at
fault,'' said Dani. ``The racists and hate groups aggravate me, but
I feel sympathy because they are sick people who need God. I blame
the government, ultimately, for failing us.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom had a quote on her old office door: `Evil wins when
good men do nothing.' What will it take to help us _ something
catastrophic? We can send thousands of troops to Kosovo, but my mom
has to hide in her own country.''

EDITORIAL: A CHANGE OF COURSE IN BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, July 17:
</P>
<P>
   Desegregation policies that assign children to public schools
based on race, sometimes busing them to achieve integration, have
lost ground steadily since they were introduced in the 1960s and
'70s. Some policies have been swept away in court challenges while
others were rendered moot when whites withdrew to the suburbs,
making racial balance impossible to achieve. Both factors came to
bear this week in Boston, which responded to white flight _ and a
lawsuit challenging desegregation policies _ by eliminating race as
a factor in deciding where children attend school.
</P>
<P>
   This was a reasonable decision given the demographics, the legal
climate and the fact that both blacks and whites support a plan
that focuses less on race and more on improving the quality of
education. But Boston's minority children will suffer, as will the
city's future, if Boston does not keep its pledge to build new
schools in crowded minority districts and raise the level of
instruction throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   The desegregation plan was developed 25 years ago because black
students had been deliberately confined to cramped, underfinanced
schools with little possibility of a first-rate education. When the
Boston School Committee declined to remedy the problem, U.S.
District Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr. forced the issue with a busing
and desegregation plan that led to a near civil war in the white
communities of South Boston and Charlestown. The struggle over
busing, documented in J. Anthony Lukas' ``Common Ground,'' was one
of the most poisonous of that era. But some whites who opposed
desegregation in the 1970s have changed their minds. One is Lisa
McGoff Collins, whose family fought the plan but who told school
officials this week that busing had made her ``a better person'' by
exposing her to another culture. ``We feared other cultures,'' she
said, ``and that was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Racial integration is unquestionably a social good. But the
desegregation plans of the 1970s aimed to do more than put black
and white students into the same classroom. The ultimate aim was to
force municipalities to spend the same effort and resources on
educating black and white children _ and to give both groups equal
access to successful schools.
</P>
<P>
   This seemed fine in the abstract, until violence erupted in
Boston's streets and whites either fled the city or placed their
children in non-public schools. The racial balance that had seemed
a plausible goal in 1974, when Boston's schools were slightly more
than half white, began to seem more and more remote as white
representation fell to its present level of about 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The danger for Boston's future is that a mainly white civic
leadership will withdraw support, turning its back on the blacks
and Latinos who fill the schools. To avoid that outcome, school
officials will have to make it clear that everyone has a stake in
the system, showing the public that all of the system's children
can learn.

<P>
   NEWARK _ This city, which has been furiously reimagining itself
in recent years as performing arts center and a transportation hub,
donned a baseball uniform Friday with the opening of Riverfront
Park stadium and the return of minor-league baseball to Newark
after a 50-year absence.
</P>
<P>
   The new 6,000 seat, $34 million stadium, financed by the city
and Essex County, will be the home of the Newark Bears. The name is
drawn from the Triple-A New York Yankees farm team that won two
dozen divisional and league championships and three minor-league
equivalents of the World Series. The Yankees imagery dominated
Friday as the Bears' owner, Rick Cerone, a former Yankees catcher
who grew up in Newark, brought in the legendary Yankees Yogi Berra
and Phil Rizzuto for the opening ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the stadium the ``House That Rick Built,'' the master of
ceremonies had county and city elected officials lined up along the
first base line. Clowns, a costumed stilt walker, bagpipers and
some Bears players circulated among the soldout crowd. A video
about the old Newark Bears and the city's Newark Eagles of the
Negro leagues played on a giant scoreboard screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a carnival atmosphere and that's what it should be,''
said Cerone, speaking to reporters before the game while
self-consciously twisting the huge World Series ring on his left
hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears _ in violet shirts, white pants and white and violet
caps _ took the field for the first time to the pulsing beat of
rock music, ready to face the LeHigh Valley Black Diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   The emotions in the stands ran the gamut.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Goldman, the president of the nearby New Jersey Performing
Arts Center whose opening 18 months ago heralded an important
beginning to the city's revitalization, said that ``arts and
sports, sports and arts would prove to be the leading edge of
change in urban areas.'' He went on to cite examples in Pittsburgh,
Dallas, Cleveland and Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   For Diana Hawks, a longtime Newark resident it was ``someplace
to take the grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Isaias Vasquez, 10, attending his first baseball game, was in
search of similar memories. Looking around the stadium and
pronouncing it ``beautiful,'' he said: ``I just want to get hit by
a ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Situated on seven acres near the Passaic River that once housed
iron foundries, carriage works and a dairy, Riverfront is the
stadium that almost wasn't built.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, just two weeks before city and county officials
were to break ground on county parkland about a mile away,
neighborhood opponents of the plan obtained landmarks designation
for the park and blocked construction.
</P>
<P>
   The Essex County Improvement Authority, the designated builder,
had to shift gears, revise the financing plans, find a new site,
negotiate to buy land from private owners and deal with new
construction realities. The changes pushed the costs 50 percent
over initial estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Even as work started, there remained skepticism, Cerone said.
From January to June, Cerone said the team got no calls from
advertisers seeking space on the scoreboard or outfield fences or
takers for their luxury skyboxes. Most thought work would never be
finished by Friday, he said, adding: ``But once the light towers
went up last month and the sod went down, they started calling. Now
we have a waiting list for everything including promotions for our
36 home games.''
</P>
<P>
   All last winter and spring the contractor has been playing
``beat the clock,'' said Harris Levy, the construction manager for
the project with Prismatic Development Corp.. Friday, still looking
much like a construction site with trailers clogging dusty flats,
and some cement walkways cordoned off and still drying, the stadium
was pronounced ``fan-ready'' by Levy.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the six-team, independent Atlantic League, the Newark
Bears are part of a boom in minor league baseball that experts say
is being fed by the same promise of economic development that comes
with having a major league team and stadium. Currently there are
five independent leagues, which are not affiliated with
major-league teams or their farm systems, with a total of 48 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Simpson, editor of Baseball Today, the trade publication
that focuses on minor league baseball, the teams of the Atlantic
League are an ``aggressive'' bunch who are paying more than some
other leagues in an effort to get good players and who seem to have
a flair for the marketing necessary to build fan interest and
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in their first year of operations and when they played
home games at Bridgeport and Skylands Park in far west Sussex
County, the Bears came in last with a record of 17-33.
</P>
<P>
   Team manager Tom O'Malley said that ``feeling like nomads'' with
no place to call home may have accounted for that dismal record.
After an equally dismal first half of the season, the team has
started the second half with a 1-2 record.

FUTURE'S UPON US: WORLD POPULATION TO TOP 6 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JON KAMMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any moment now, there will be 6 billion of us. Human beings,
sharing planet Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Census Bureau, which keeps odometerlike counters
running on its Web site to offer its best estimates of the nation's
and world's expanding population, says the milestone, frightful to
many, but little cause for alarm to others, will occur Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations, the only other body that attempts a world
count, calculates that the 6 billion mark will be reached in
October. A number of environmental and population-control
organizations will observe the event Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the date, the numbers tracked by both organizations
portray staggering growth since the dawn of the Industrial
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   It took all of human history up to 1804 for the human race to
achieve a world population of 1 billion. It took only 12 years to
leap from 5 billion to 6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1960, the Earth's population has doubled. The world is
gaining more than 77 million people annually, roughly the
equivalent of adding a new France, Greece and Sweden each year, or
a city the size of Phoenix every six days.
</P>
<P>
   And though fertility rates are declining, the United Nation
projects the world population will swell by an additional 3 billion
by 2054.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, are we breeding ourselves out of existence?
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally, I think it's fairly scary,'' George L. Cowgill,
an Arizona State University anthropology professor, says of the 6
billion mark. ``It's not something that should cause people to
panic, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowgill contemplates the perils of overpopulation as a sideline
to his study of settlements in central Mexico dating back 2,000
years. (Earth's population was an estimated 300 million to 500
million.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are limits to how many people the Earth can
support, but anybody who tries to put a number on it is just
guessing,'' Cowgill says.
</P>
<P>
   Groups such as ZPG, for zero population growth, founded in the
1960s by Stanford University Professor Paul Ehrlich and activists
inspired by his watershed book ``The Population Bomb,'' react with
greater alarm to what is known as Y6B, the year of 6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every 20 minutes, the world adds another 3,500 human lives but
loses one or more entire species of animal or plant life, at least
27,000 species per year,'' ZPG writes. ``This is a rate and scale
of extinction that has not occurred in 65 million years.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Conservation Union published a survey in 1996
estimating that one-fourth of mammals and amphibians, one-fifth of
reptiles, more than one-third of fish and 11 percent of birds are
in danger of extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ``inch for inch, in human-manipulated environments
there still is enormous biodiversity,'' says Professor Charles
Redman, director of ASU's Center for Environmental Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are eliminating things, and that is deplorable, but we're
also introducing other things, both exotics and greater quantities
of native species, just as fast,'' says Redman, a professor of
anthropology who is heading a long-term study of the biological
health of Phoenix and central Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Redman cites several grounds for optimism: the remarkable
adaptability of various life forms, human ingenuity and ample
evidence that people can and do regulate themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what has happened . . . here we are. . . . We've
overcome all the difficulties,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Cowgill points to the youthfulness, and therefore fertility, of
today's population as a big concern. The United Nations estimates
the world has 1 billion teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Fan, who headed the now-inactive Metro Phoenix Chapter of
ZPG, asks, ``How in the world do you stop 6 billion people from
continuing to multiply?''
</P>
<P>
   The litany of worries about overpopulation extends from food
shortages to global warming; economic paralysis to warfare over
resource shortages; pollution of water supplies and the oceans to
denuding of forests; befoulment of air to decline in soil quality;
greater traffic congestion to fewer educational opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest issue of late is the unequal distribution and
consumption of resources between developed and undeveloped
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The richest fifth (of the world's people) consumes 86 percent
of all goods and services and produces 53 percent of all carbon
dioxide emissions,'' says ZPG, while the figures for the poorest
fifth are 1.3 percent and 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the most comforting signs are declining fertility
rates, the number of children born per woman during her fertile
years.
</P>
<P>
   Annual world population growth appears to have peaked at 86
million in 1989. Average global fertility has been halved, from a
high of about six children per woman in the 1950s to 2.9 today.
</P>
<P>
   No single industrialized nation in the world has a fertility
rate above replacement level, which is about 2.06 children per
woman. The United States, with 2.03 children per woman, has the
highest fertility rate in the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   The average fertility rate for European countries is 1.4. In
Japan, it's also 1.4.
</P>
<P>
   In the Third World, where 98 percent of population growth is
expected to take place, there have also been dramatic declines.
Since 1985, the fertility rate for developing countries has fallen
from 4.7 to 3.1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demographers have been repeatedly amazed at how rapidly
fertility rates have come down in a matter of a few decades,'' said
Brian Halweil of the Worldwatch Institute, a non-profit
organization that analyzes global trends.
</P>
<P>
   However, slower growth is a long way from no growth.
</P>
<P>
   In Africa, the Middle East and southern Asia, fertility rates
remain high. In 40 African nations, women still average six
children. Niger leads the world with 7.5 children per woman. And
Latin America is still growing, albeit more slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Religion also is criticized as deterring attempts to curtail
population, specifically the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   But Monsignor Edward Ryle of Phoenix, executive director of the
Arizona Catholic Conference, points out that from the time of Pope
John XXIII in the early 1960s, the Catholic Church has considered
limiting population an acceptable means for the faithful to achieve
economic, social and political enlightenment. &QL;

EDITORIAL: GRIDLOCK CITY  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, July 17:
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan's hottest piece of real estate, Times Square, has
gotten so crowded lately that pedestrians often have to wait in
line to cross the street. The newest arrival, Conde Nast
Publications, plans to hold court in its icy tower by mid-August.
ABC's ``Good Morning America'' will settle nearby in September. The
human gridlock can only get worse in November, when the World
Wrestling Federation hunkers down in the Paramount Building to open
a theme restaurant. The real theater this fall will unfold on
Broadway, the street.
</P>
<P>
   As New Yorkers and tourists converge on already crowded
sidewalks, the question of what to do about pedestrian congestion
is unavoidable. Proposals are circulating to improve sidewalk
conditions, but the Department of Transportation confirms only
plans to resurface streets and make crosswalk signals more
internationally recognizable.
</P>
<P>
   Times Square already includes some of the city's more hazardous
intersections. Drivers career up the side streets to escape
construction, making jaywalking and even legal crossings more
perilous. The islands near the bow tie of Seventh Avenue and
Broadway are clogged with visitors waiting for lower-cost theater
tickets. Across the street, teen-agers gather under MTV's
street-front studio screaming for a wave from VJ Carson Daly. The
arrival of ``Good Morning America,'' with its celebrity guests,
could entice even bigger crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders advocate the use of mid-block passageways
through Shubert Alley and the Marriott Marquis Hotel to avoid the
growing sidewalk scramble. The city should also consider widening
sidewalks, adjusting stoplights to give pedestrians more time to
cross and strictly enforcing driving regulations.
</P>
<P>
   As entertaining as it might be to watch wrestling stars like
Hulk Hogan vying with Vogue editors for the next light, it would be
better to give pedestrians a little more elbow room.

DON'T SOCK IT TO ME: THE SOCKS ALREADY HAVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Socks &AMP; Things
</P>
<P>
   I had a thought, a simple thought.
</P>
<P>
   I threw it in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   There it grew large,
</P>
<P>
   'til it was forged
</P>
<P>
   And thus became desire.
</P>
<P>
   I did not want it,
</P>
<P>
   Did not need it
</P>
<P>
   Among my mind's possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Still it grew
</P>
<P>
   Until like new
</P>
<P>
   And it became Obsession.
</P>
<P>
   I've been thinking. I haven't done a lot of thinking, just a
little thinking so that I don't get overwhelmed and start to feel
the need to actually do something productive.
</P>
<P>
   I just kind of like to talk about the thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I've been thinking about that sock issue again. It's
just so very puzzling to me. I know we've discussed it ad nauseum,
and there's nothing we can do about the sock disposal hidden in the
dryer.
</P>
<P>
   However, yesterday, I counted 18 single socks in my youngest
son's drawer. Eighteen, for goodness sakes! Where the heck are the
socks going?
</P>
<P>
   I have visions of a little old lady somewhere knitting a giant
quilt made out of athletic socks. It's so big that it can cover the
entire state of Missouri. Or maybe there's a big sailboat on the
lake, and it's shaped like a shoe. Its sails are made of thousands
of socks. It cruises, and sometimes it smells like a locker room.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know. I just want the socks back.
</P>
<P>
   Why can't you go to the pawnshop and buy single socks? They have
everything else.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of a sock recycling center, which probably isn't very
practical, I propose that we simply dispense with the apparel
etiquette regarding feet. Why do the socks have to match anyway?
</P>
<P>
   We're wearing polka-dot shorts with striped shirts now. Men wear
ties that have absolutely nothing on them to complement their
suits. Women have been given freedom by the fashion industry to mix
gold and silver jewelry. As far as I can tell, many models don't
comb their hair or shave anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Why all the angst about the socks matching, especially under a
pant leg?
</P>
<P>
   Let's free ourselves of all these restrictions and conventions.
Socks cost too much to toss them just because one goes on the lam.
Let's not even roll them up into those little balls anymore; just
throw them in the drawer and pick out any two, randomly, when
needed. Don't we have enough stress in our lives already?
</P>
<P>
   I made this suggestion to my loved ones, and they just looked at
me with a mixture of sympathy and disbelief. They can't embrace the
vision. If we can only get Ricky Martin or Cher to do it, it will
quickly become the rage. Of course, we could just pin the sock
pairs together before we wash and dry them. Nah, what's the fun in
that?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I have to go; my family is getting that straitjacket out
again. I have to act normal now. I'll go put on a pair of matching
socks, if I can find one. That fools them every time.

PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS, VOT ERS DUEL OVER GUN ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Presidential candidates, like calculating poker
players, once believed they had more to lose than gain by
mentioning guns.
</P>
<P>
   But a rash of shootings by teenagers and young adults has some
in the 2000 campaign gambling that the time is right to speak out
about gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Even those candidates who seek little or no change in the law
are finding their gun-control positions more scrutinized than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
   While voters often complain there is little distinction between
the political parties, gun control is an issue in which the lines
couldn't be more defined: The Democrats want to dramatically
strengthen gun laws, while the Republicans favor modest controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about as clear as it gets,'' said Allan J. Lichtman,
chairman of the history department at American University. ``There
really are quite sharply chiseled differences between the
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   As the candidates campaign for the primaries in early 2000,
voters will find there also are differences within the parties
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, Elizabeth Dole broke ranks early in May by
endorsing mandatory child-safety locks for handguns. Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., also favors mandatory locks, but former Vice
President Dan Quayle does not. Neither does Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, the GOP front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush ``has supported voluntary efforts of gun
manufacturers for child-safety locks,'' Bush spokeswoman Mindy
Tucker said. Some gunmakers have voluntarily agreed to
automatically sell a safety device with every handgun, but many
have not.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to his Democratic rivals, Bush has not proposed any
new federal gun controls. ``What he wants to focus on is
prosecuting the criminals who commit the crimes with the guns,''
Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush does support instant background checks on gun purchasers at
gun and ammunition shows, something that already is required of the
licensed dealers at those events. The idea behind instant checks is
to ensure that gun-show customers around the nation are screened
even if they buy from unlicensed vendors.
</P>
<P>
   But gun-control advocates say the instant-check proposal falls
short because it realistically can take a few days for the FBI to
determine whether buyers have criminal or mental-health records
that would disqualify them from buying a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is among 14 states in which officials conduct background
checks by linking directly to FBI computers. In most other states,
the FBI conducts the checks, or the checks are made with a
combination of state and FBI resources.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, accusing Bush of undue caution, believe they can
capitalize on the issue if Bush wins the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But Frank Luntz, a well-known Republican pollster based in
suburban Washington, disagrees. He said Americans are concerned
about school violence, but that they don't believe gun control is
necessarily the answer, especially not when presented with other
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, they (the Democrats) will score in New York, and they may
score in San Francisco. But in the rest of the country, gun control
is the least-best option for most Americans,'' Luntz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the option is only gun control or nothing, the public will
overwhelmingly choose gun control. But if this is put in the
context of other components in society _ whether it be Hollywood
and television, violence in video games, even criminal elements
such as stricter sentencing, tougher laws _ they will choose those
options over gun control,'' Luntz said.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democratic candidates, Vice President Al Gore and former
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, have both called for mandatory
registration of handguns and a ban on cheap ``junk guns'' that are
easy to buy and conceal.
</P>
<P>
   Their proposals go way too far for GOP candidates. None of the
Republicans favors registration of new handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're absolutely opposed,'' said Jonathan Baron, a spokesman
for Quayle. ``The Second Amendment (right to bear arms) clearly and
unarguably does not permit, in his view, the registration of
handguns.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' aggressive stance represents an historic change.
For years, candidates of both parties were afraid of touching the
issue for fear of alienating either rural, pro-gun voters on one
side, or urban, gun-control advocates on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, in particular, has long been regarded as a strong
gun-rights state. Most of the state's GOP federal officeholders
have sided with gun manufacturers in rejecting most gun-control
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Following an emotional gun-control debate in Congress last
month, Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., issued a statement detailing the
delicate balancing act that the issue often presents.
</P>
<P>
   During the debate, Kolbe favored a 24-hour waiting period _ but
no longer _ to conduct background checks on gun-show purchasers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the civilian's right to bear arms and I believe
in a legitimate government role in assuring public safety,'' Kolbe
said. ``These are not mutually exclusive. They appear to clash and
conflict, but they also converge. I have been both enthused and
exasperated at trying, with others, to create the proper
equilibrium.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Democrats are gambling that the string of school
shootings _ from West Paducah, Ken., to Littleton, Colo. _ has
altered the political climate.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the April rampage by two Columbine High School
students in Littleton that left 13 innocent victims dead has helped
make the issue more politically potent, especially among women
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Providing the issue with a face, more than 80 high school
students from Littleton and the Denver area appeared Thursday with
President Clinton to endorse gun-law reforms, including
child-safety locks and gun-show background checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a diverse group who do not agree on everything, but we
do agree that our gun laws are not working and must be changed,''
said David Winkler, a recent graduate of a Denver high school.
``While Columbine was overwhelming, tragedies of a smaller scale
take place every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, the underdog for the Democratic nomination, believes
there now is ``an opportunity to do something the public wants and
really needs leadership on,'' said Eric Hauser, his spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitudes on gun control, whether you're looking at
polling or anecdotes, show that there is a yearning to reduce gun
violence,'' Hauser said.
</P>
<P>
   Political scientists say the school shootings have accelerated
the gun-control debate. If there is indeed a window for gun
control, the academicians don't know how long it will last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the country has ever seen anything in its entire
history like this rash of school shootings,'' American University's
Lichtman said. ``And the American public does tend to be aroused by
the spectacular, flashy or, in this case, horribly tragic events.
They give prominence to issues that were not nearly as prominent
prior to that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jack Nagel, a University of Pennsylvania political
scientist, said the election year is still months away _ quite a
long time in politics for an issue to endure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it depends mainly on what else competes with it (gun
control),'' Nagel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gun control seems to be analogous to abortion in that it's
something that a minority of people feel passionate about. Most
people, although they care about it, usually don't rank it that
high in their priorities. But if the economy continues not to be a
worry and if there is no big foreign policy problem, then their
attention might shift to this, especially because of Columbine,''
Nagel said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Republican candidates are still cautious about the
subject to the point of sounding skittish.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, for example, won't use the expression ``gun control.'' It
is, in effect, banned from her vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't view it that way (as gun control),'' said her
spokesman, Ari Fleischer. ``She calls it `crime control' and `gun
safety.''' &QL;

MICROSOFT PREVAILS IN SUIT BY SOFTWARE MAKER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CORRECTS spelling O'Melveny   in 16th graf.)  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn.)   (See also MICROSOFT-WEALTH) 
(rk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a David versus Goliath case, a courtroom confrontation
between a struggling little software maker and the mighty Microsoft
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was accused of befriending the fledgling company when
it suited its interests and then callously casting the company
aside when it was no longer useful, denying it access to
Microsoft's technology on fair terms. The tactic, the plaintiff's
lawyers argued, was a violation of federal antitrust laws and all
but a death sentence for Bristol Technology Inc., of Danbury, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Friday, as an uptick in Microsoft's stock price lifted the
personal wealth of Bill Gates to nearly $100 billion, a Connecticut
jury of five men and three women, ranging in age from 21 to late
60s, whose job status ran the gamut from unemployed to corporate
executive, sided with Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   The jury in U.S. District Court in Bridgeport, Conn., found that
Microsoft had not violated antitrust laws in its dealings with
Bristol.
</P>
<P>
   The private suit in Connecticut has no direct impact on the
major antitrust challenge Microsoft faces _ the federal case
brought by the Justice Department and 19 states. The charges and
evidence are different.
</P>
<P>
   But antitrust experts said Friday's verdict would certainly
hearten the Microsoft legal team in Washington. Despite the
differences, Microsoft has been portrayed in both cases as an
overreaching monopolist who used its market power as a club _ a
characterization supported by piles of Microsoft e-mail and
internal documents that spoke forcefully of destroying rivals and
leaning on partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a decisive triumph for Microsoft, and it has to be a
shot of adrenalin for the Microsoft lawyers working on the
government case,'' said William Kovacic, a professor at the George
Washington University law school. ``This verdict may not have any
direct effect on the government case, but it shows Microsoft that
it can win these cases, even when much of the evidence in court is
unflattering.''
</P>
<P>
   In celebrating their victory, the Microsoft lawyers certainly
echoed the same themes of the company's defense in the government
case _ that its business practices are merely the rough-and-tumble
of modern capitalism, and that the computer software market moves
so rapidly that Microsoft can scarcely be considered an entrenched
monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The considered opinion of the community in which Bristol
operates is that Microsoft did nothing wrong,'' said David Tulchin,
a partner at Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell who was Microsoft's lead trial
lawyer. ``All that Microsoft did was compete hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Aeschbacher, a senior corporate lawyer at Microsoft, said
that the verdict strongly suggested that the jury was ``impressed
by all the evidence in the record of the intensity and dynamism of
competition in the software industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bristol had sought a stiff financial penalty against Microsoft _
damages ranging from $130 million to $263 million, which, if
Microsoft was found to violate antitrust laws, would be tripled.
</P>
<P>
   The jury did find that Microsoft had violated a Connecticut law
prohibiting ``deceptive practices,'' like making misleading
statements to a business partner. But for that unspecified
transgression, the jury awarded Bristol a mere $1.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not even a parking ticket,'' observed Kovacic of George
Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   Not even that for Microsoft, which has nearly $22 billion in
cash on hand, according to its most recent financial statement.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol said it disappointed by the outcome and that it was
``exploring'' the option of appealing the verdict. ``We still
firmly believe that Microsoft engaged in anti-competitive behavior
against Bristol,'' said Keith Blackwell, the chief executive of
Bristol.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Lynch, a partner at O'Melveny &AMP; Myers and lead counsel
for Bristol, said: ``This is a case of great importance to the
entire computer industry. While the ruling is disappointing to
Bristol, this is an issue that is not going to go away. Microsoft's
abuse of its dominant position has to be addressed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, antitrust experts say the Bristol suit was a high-risk
legal case from the outset. First, they say, the case focused on
the software markets for computer work stations and so-called
server computers, which feed data out to desktop machines in
computer networks. In those markets, Microsoft is not nearly as
dominant as it is in the market for desktop operating systems for
personal computers, where its Windows software runs more than 90
percent of PCs sold.
</P>
<P>
   Second, antitrust experts note that Bristol relied on the
antitrust theory that Microsoft had a ``duty to deal'' with
Bristol. And the experts point out that duty-to-deal cases, which
regard the plaintiff almost as a regulated utility, have been
difficult to win in recent years. The main exceptions, they note,
have been in industries with traditions of regulation, like
telecommunications, or businesses involving natural assets, like
ski slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, for its sweeping antitrust case, the government
did depose Blackwell of Bristol. But the Justice Department chose
to focus instead on Microsoft's use of its market power derived
from its dominance of the PC operating system market. The
government has charged that the company used its Windows monopoly
to stifle competition from the rise of Internet software. And the
government also steered clear of any duty-to-deal claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bristol chose to bring a case in one of the most pro-defendant
areas of antitrust,'' said Robert E. Hall, a professor at Stanford
University. ``Courts have been very reluctant to say that companies
must share their intellectual property.''
</P>
<P>
   Bristol makes software that allows programs written for
Microsoft's Windows to run on work stations or servers that use
Unix, an industrial-strength operating system popular among
corporate users. In 1994, when Microsoft was still having trouble
cracking into the market for corporate computing, it signed a
three-year licensing deal with Bristol. It allowed Bristol broad
access to Microsoft's Windows technology.
</P>
<P>
   But three years later, when Microsoft's own powerful operating
system, Windows NT, was making strong inroads into the corporate
market, the deal offered to Bristol was very different. Microsoft
wanted corporate customers to switch from Unix to Windows NT, and
Bristol alleged that its ``translation'' software _ once an asset
for Microsoft _ was now seen by Microsoft as a potential impediment
to the migration of customers to Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   So when renegotiating the contract, Microsoft offered Bristol a
new license, but at four times the price and with far less access
to Microsoft technology. ``Microsoft's dealings with Bristol are a
classic bait-and-switch,'' Lynch, the Bristol lawyer, asserted
before the trial began in June.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft did not deny that its license terms had changed, but
it explained that was because the market conditions changed.
Besides, Microsoft says that another company, Mainsoft Inc.,
accepted the same terms that were offered to Bristol. Microsoft
argued that Bristol was trying to elevate a garden-variety contract
dispute into an antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Inc. magazine ranked Bristol 140th among the 500
fastest-growing companies in the nation, with a payroll of 70
people and estimated revenues of $8 million. But the failure to
renew its Microsoft license has placed Bristol's future in doubt,
and it has spent heavily on its suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bristol's mistake was that it chose to litigate instead of
negotiate,'' said Aeschbacher of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The jury in Connecticut agreed.

GATES HITS $100 BILLION MARK, MORE OR LESS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CORRECTS figure in fourth graf to 19.8 percent.) 
(ATTN: Calif., Mass., Wash.)  (See also MICROSOFT-VERDICT) 
(rk) 
 By AMY HARMON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last month, in the largest gift ever by a living person to a
charitable foundation, Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft Corp.,
donated $5 billion to support education and health care causes.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, in a few hours of stock market trading, Gates' holdings
surged by just about that amount, brushing $100 billion for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   The mixture of awe and dismay that has long characterized
America's fixation on Gates' personal wealth was perhaps best
summed up Friday by Vincent Malgapo, a contributor to the Silicon
Investor electronic discussion forums: ``Bill Gates MSFT stock
worth $100 Billion right now!'' read the comment, which was posted
at 11:41 a.m. ``WOW!''
</P>
<P>
   Gates, who owns 19.8 percent, or about 1 billion shares, of the
company he co-founded in 1975, owes his world record to the
remarkable performance of Microsoft's stock. Shares of the software
company climbed 5.4 percent Friday to a record high of $99.4375, on
expectations that it will establish a separate tracking stock for
its Internet properties.
</P>
<P>
   The company is the first to top $500 billion in market value. If
it were a country it would have the ninth-largest economy in the
world, behind Spain, which has a gross domestic product of $553
billion.
</P>
<P>
   But the ballooning of Microsoft's stock price simply does not
hold the same fascination as that of its chairman's brokerage
account.
</P>
<P>
   ``He finally did it,'' said Paul Saffo, director of the
Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif. ``This is what we've
all been waiting for. How much interest do you suppose it
generates? I bet it's a 747 per day.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Greenspun, creator of the Bill Gates Personal Wealth
Clock, a Web site that continuously calculates the value of Gates'
Microsoft stock, had a more pointed speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this will convince my students they shouldn't work so
hard to become rich,'' said Greenspun, a researcher at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's laboratory for computer
science. ``Because they're probably not going to be richer than
Bill Gates, so they might as well do something interesting and
valuable to society instead.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time of sustained economic prosperity, America's proclivity
to celebrate wealth is reflected in the high marks Gates still
receives in national opinion polls. And the 43-year-old executive,
who lives in a $60 million mansion on the shores of Lake Washington
with his wife and two children, has recently begun to contribute
more to philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   But the $100 billion mark may also mark a change in popular
perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gates has crossed a psychological marker, and it's going to
increase pressure on him to recycle more and more of that money
through his foundations,'' said Ron Chernow, an economic historian.
``There will be more attention focused on the extraordinarily
lopsided distribution of wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Gates is not the only software entrepreneur to become
fabulously wealthy in recent years. Microsoft's co-founder, Paul
Allen, and its chief executive, Steve Ballmer, are among the
world's five richest people, along with investor Warren E. Buffett,
whose 39.9 percent stake in the investment holding company
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is valued at about $42.5 billion, making
him second to Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of founders of fledgling Internet companies have become
worth millions on paper in a matter of months.
</P>
<P>
   And by some calculations, Gates is less wealthy than John D.
Rockefeller, who had in excess of 2 percent of the gross national
product at the peak of his wealth in 1913.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it may not be long before Gates passes another milestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is when he reaches a trillion,'' said Lewis D'vorkin,
an executive editor at Forbes magazine, which publishes an annual
list of the world's 400 richest people. ``If Microsoft share price
grows in the next five years as fast as it has in the last five, he
hits the big one in 2004.''

<P>
   NEWARK _ This city, which has been furiously reimagining itself
in recent years as performing arts center and a transportation hub,
donned a baseball uniform Friday with the opening of Riverfront
Park stadium and the return of minor-league baseball to Newark
after a 50-year absence.
</P>
<P>
   The new 6,000 seat, $34 million stadium, financed by the city
and Essex County, will be the home of the Newark Bears. The name is
drawn from the Triple-A New York Yankees farm team that won two
dozen divisional and league championships and three minor-league
equivalents of the World Series. The Yankees imagery dominated
Friday as the Bears' owner, Rick Cerone, a former Yankees catcher
who grew up in Newark, brought in the legendary Yankees Yogi Berra
and Phil Rizzuto for the opening ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the stadium the ``House That Rick Built,'' the master of
ceremonies had county and city elected officials lined up along the
first base line. Clowns, a costumed stilt walker, bagpipers and
some Bears players circulated among the soldout crowd. A video
about the old Newark Bears and the city's Newark Eagles of the
Negro leagues played on a giant scoreboard screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a carnival atmosphere and that's what it should be,''
said Cerone, speaking to reporters before the game while
self-consciously twisting the huge World Series ring on his left
hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears _ in violet shirts, white pants and white and violet
caps _ took the field for the first time to the pulsing beat of
rock music, ready to face the Lehigh Valley Black Diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   The emotions in the stands ran the gamut.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Goldman, the president of the nearby New Jersey Performing
Arts Center whose opening 18 months ago heralded an important
beginning to the city's revitalization, said that ``arts and
sports, sports and arts would prove to be the leading edge of
change in urban areas.'' He went on to cite examples in Pittsburgh,
Dallas, Cleveland and Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   For Diana Hawks, a longtime Newark resident it was ``someplace
to take the grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Isaias Vasquez, 10, attending his first baseball game, was in
search of similar memories. Looking around the stadium and
pronouncing it ``beautiful,'' he said: ``I just want to get hit by
a ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Situated on seven acres near the Passaic River that once housed
iron foundries, carriage works and a dairy, Riverfront is the
stadium that almost wasn't built.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, just two weeks before city and county officials
were to break ground on county parkland about a mile away,
neighborhood opponents of the plan obtained landmarks designation
for the park and blocked construction.
</P>
<P>
   The Essex County Improvement Authority, the designated builder,
had to shift gears, revise the financing plans, find a new site,
negotiate to buy land from private owners and deal with new
construction realities. The changes pushed the costs 50 percent
over initial estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Even as work started, there remained skepticism, Cerone said.
From January to June, Cerone said the team got no calls from
advertisers seeking space on the scoreboard or outfield fences or
takers for their luxury skyboxes. Most thought work would never be
finished by Friday, he said, adding: ``But once the light towers
went up last month and the sod went down, they started calling. Now
we have a waiting list for everything including promotions for our
36 home games.''
</P>
<P>
   All last winter and spring the contractor has been playing
``beat the clock,'' said Harris Levy, the construction manager for
the project with Prismatic Development Corp.. Friday, still looking
much like a construction site with trailers clogging dusty flats,
and some cement walkways cordoned off and still drying, the stadium
was pronounced ``fan-ready'' by Levy.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the six-team, independent Atlantic League, the Newark
Bears are part of a boom in minor league baseball that experts say
is being fed by the same promise of economic development that comes
with having a major league team and stadium. Currently there are
five independent leagues, which are not affiliated with
major-league teams or their farm systems, with a total of 48 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Simpson, editor of Baseball Today, the trade publication
that focuses on minor league baseball, the teams of the Atlantic
League are an ``aggressive'' bunch who are paying more than some
other leagues in an effort to get good players and who seem to have
a flair for the marketing necessary to build fan interest and
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in their first year of operations and when they played
home games at Bridgeport and Skylands Park in far west Sussex
County, the Bears came in last with a record of 17-33.
</P>
<P>
   Team manager Tom O'Malley said that ``feeling like nomads'' with
no place to call home may have accounted for that dismal record.
After an equally dismal first half of the season, the team has
started the second half with a 1-2 record.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday night, the Bears gave the fans a thriller, winning
9-8 in 10 innings.

COMMON CAUSE WITH MONTENEGRO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As in a Sophoclean tragedy that bestows calamities on every
member of an accursed family, the curtain is now rising on
Montenegro, the last Yugoslav republic to remain yoked to the
Serbian regime of Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro, under the democratic leadership of President Milo
Djukanovic, has witnessed the brutal blundering of Milosevic in
Kosovo and decided it must have either political parity in a
restructured Yugoslav Federation or independence.
</P>
<P>
   The Montenegrin predicament merits tactful understanding from
the Western democracies. The leadership in Montenegro was as
horrified as the NATO allies at Milosevic's recidivist crimes in
Kosovo, yet Montenegrins suffered under NATO bombs and now must
face the economic consequences of NATO's air war against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Western Djukanovic, whose administration entered crucial
negotiations this week with Milosevic's representatives, would
prefer a change of regime in Belgrade to secession from Yugoslavia.
But there is no assurance that Milosevic will step down or be
removed any time soon. And as long as he remains in power,
Milosevic will have powerful incentives to prevent Montenegro from
seceding from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The moment Montenegro leaves the federation, Yugoslavia will
cease to exist, and Milosevic will cease to be its president.
Moreover, a Serbia that is no longer federated with Montenegro in a
Yugoslav state would become not only a pariah among nations but a
landlocked pariah. Hence Milosevic can be counted on to do
everything in his power to keep Montenegro within Yugoslavia. The
fate of Milosevic cannot be separated from the outcome of
Montenegro's challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro is asking not only for equal political representation
in Yugoslav institutions but for free and fair elections and
integration into Europe. These are demands Milosevic can hardly
satisfy.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic deserves unflinching support in the coming showdown
with Milosevic so that the peoples of the region may recover from
the calamities wrought by Milosevic.

   Smith's writings on the subject make him a fine advocate. And he
points out that reformers want to change the law, too. Still, his
opposition to the thrust of the law would make him a poor
commissioner. President Clinton is correct in refusing to appoint
him. Clinton would do well to end the practice of filling FEC jobs
on the basis of congressional recommendations. At a minimum, he
should ask Lott for a more fitting choice.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and McConnell, however, have stubbornly resorted to a
time-tested strategy: legislative blackmail. They are holding up
Clinton's nomination of Richard Holbrooke to be UN ambassador.
Holbrooke, though prickly, is an accomplished diplomat whose
qualifications are manifest. Even Lott admits that he will likely
be confirmed in the end. The stalemate, he implied, is to get
Clinton's attention. ``We need to get an understanding of how this
(FEC appointment) is going to work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All this game-playing is a way of life in Washington but a
mystery outside the Beltway.
</P>
<P>
   Forcing the United States to shuffle along at the United Nations
for months without a permanent ambassador is an embarrassment,
especially when the obvious candidate is at hand. Muscling Clinton
to make an FEC appointment singularly unsuited to the job is
stranger still.
</P>
<P>
   Most bizarre is the cynicism involved in linking the two so that
stalemate will guarantee no action. Congress should think better of
itself.

M'S FUTURE AT STAKE IN UPCOMING WEEKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Minutes before the All-Star break and a few days
before the Mariners moved into their wonderful new ballpark, Jay
Buhner took a moment to remind his teammates of the serious
business ahead.
</P>
<P>
   As a veteran and a leader and a 12-year Mariner who has been
abundantly committed to the team and the community, Buhner said he
was not going to let go unsaid that a lot was at stake between July
15 and July 31, the trading deadline for major league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of young guys here, and I just told them this
(stuff) is serious. If we're not in it, the 1st of August could
roll around and a lot of lives could be changed,'' Buhner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them to go and have a good few days off but get ready
to come back and kick some butt. There's a lot riding on this.
There are a lot of free agents on this team, and a lot of things
could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Buhner is right. The Mariners are up against it.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to rain on the Mariners' parade, except maybe the
Northwest weather, which is why the roof at Safeco Field was closed
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to be constantly suspicious of just where the
Mariners are heading, especially now, with the aisles at Safeco
Field barely sticky from spilled soda.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was Day 2 of the New Outdoor Era. It dawned gray and
drizzly _ and that was even before the area's rabid sports talkers
embarked on a day-long rant about what the heck the Mariners are
going to do improve their pitching.
</P>
<P>
   See, all the deserved pomp, circumstance and hoopla about the
Mariners' truly splendid new ballpark has had some early
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being awash in dreamy reverence for all that $517
million can build _ and it's quite a lot, especially when you add
up all those rest rooms _ the equally predominant theme du jour has
been overwrought concern about the bullpen, John Halama's ability
to keep up the good work and Jeff Fassero's capacity for turning
around his first-half yips.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is not fair that the glory of Safeco's opening day was
riddled with derision about ``New Ballpark, Same Old Mariners.''
</P>
<P>
   But when closer Jose Mesa bombed in a ninth-inning demonstration
on how not to throw strikes, walking four of the five batters he
faced and losing the game, the onslaught of catcalls was
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   You don't watch the home team lose its sixth straight and lapse
into last place in the ultra-weak American League West, which is
what happened after Mesa's meltdown, and not stop to think that
perhaps this is a sure sign of a team on the slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought (opening night) was a great game, well played, great
pitching between (Jamie) Moyer and (Andy) Ashby. It's just too bad
we came out on the short end of the stick,'' Alex Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said he never once thought about whether Mesa should
have been pulled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been the best closer we've had in five years. What's his
ratio, 18 saves in 20 attempts? What better numbers can you have? I
think he's earned the right to be out there,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to sit around and feel sorry for yourself,
you're going to be in a lot of trouble. We have to keep going. We
have to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners under Lou Piniella have always been good
second-half battlers. It was that way in 1994, just before the
strike that ended the season. It was that way in '95 when they won
the West and in '96 when they were in it until the last weekend of
the season, and again in '97.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone's patience is running thin. The credibility of the
team has suffered since last season, when Randy Johnson's trade
turned into a nine-month drain on everyone _ fans, team, manager
and Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the offseason, not enough of that credibility was
restored when the M's could have gone shopping for one pitching
ace, edged above the self-imposed salary cap and bought the
Mariners a ton of the benevolence that the front office, manager
and owners now feel is in serious short supply.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was quite so sad and ugly as watching what should have
been the start of a fresh new era start off on such a sour note.
Nothing is quite so uncomfortable as the home team booing one of
its own players on what should have been one of the best nights in
team history.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the opening days of Safeco Field feel as if they
are coinciding with the potential start to the undoing of a dream
team that never quite filled its potential.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner is right. The next two weeks are crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been an organization that has always gone out and
gotten help (if the team was in contention at the trading
deadline),'' Buhner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come too far, we have too much fun as a group to let
July 31 come and be one of the teams other people are coming to to
take our players.''
</P>
<P>
   And as much as we all want to come out and luxuriate in
Seattle's prize ballpark, it would make it so much easier if there
were fewer questions about whether this team is on the verge of
surging or dumping.

APOCALYPSE? NOT NOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 18, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Y2K bug is a problem, not a monster. But man's fears of the
unknown are pumping the thing into apocalyptic proportions in some
quarters. Like the end-of-the world visions and religious
pilgrimages that ushered in ``Y1K'' a thousand years ago, wild
millennial imaginings of modern man reduce him to a primitive and
create what the history books might dub the Panic of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with being prepared or upgrading
computers, as business and government offices are doing or have
done. The Federal Emergency Management Agency recommends that
people look at the flip of the calendar to the year 2000 the way
they might view an approaching storm _ have the flashlights,
batteries, radios, canned goods, jugged water, and enough cash on
hand for a long weekend in case the microchips blow, but don't
anticipate Armageddon.
</P>
<P>
   Some people insist on doing just that as they build bunkers,
stake out caves, or plan to sail off on boats with their cash and
stock portfolios in the hold. Retailers also report a run on
generators, with some suppliers back-ordered to the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experts'' at Y2K survival sites on the Internet advise people
to build solar stills for storing water, to become familiar with
the barter economy, to know advanced first aid, to expect martial
law or a military invasion, to have guns ready with 200 rounds of
ammunition, to have cash for two months, and to buy a three-month
supply of groceries, including 20 pounds of wheat and corn per
person _ don't forget the hand-cranked grain mill.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone ``caught without a mill,'' notes one Web site, should put
an inch of grain into a can, hold the can on the ground between his
or her feet, and then pound the grain with a pipe.
</P>
<P>
   These people should get a grip _ on a lot more than their grain
pipes. The world as we know it is not about to disappear. It may
have a case of hiccups or a bad cold on Dec. 31, but with so many
technological wizards focused on the problem, the bug is not likely
to turn into Godzilla. Public calm will help minimize any trouble.
The bunker mentality and hoarding will only make it worse.

 DUNBAR: poll-tailored evasions. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``God will be setting my term limit,'' says Hechler rather
nonchalantly. ``But I don't want to be known as the candidate of
the seniors,'' he insists. As a native New Yorker, he moved here in
the 1950s, fresh from working in the idealistic campaigns of Adlai
Stevenson, to teach political science at Marshall College and try
to engender fresh interest in politics among the young.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a legend,'' said Bill Walker, a 24-year-old political
science student from Marshall working the picnic crowd at Hechler's
side as a summer intern. ``Just to someday look back and say I
learned politics from Hechler is a great honor,'' said the student.
He exuded the dedication of one of the young interns in the special
state program in which elderly mountaineers have been reinstilling
the art of fiddle playing lost by earlier generations who had to
emigrate for work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you, people my age are soured on politics lately,''
said Walker, who is determined to run for political office at the
earliest opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   As the elderly come to the fore, state politics are shifting to
consider issues like how the revenue base will hold up as more
retirees claim special tax abatements. ``Most studies show incoming
retirees are actually increasing the economic base,'' said Dudley
of state senior services. ``They bring in an average of $250,000 in
liquid assets, and they're a tremendous resource in volunteer work,
politics and civics.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all the states, West Virginia faces the potential trauma
from the retirement of a wide swath of talent when the baby boomer
generation hits 65. ``We'll feel it a little quicker,'' said
Dudley. But he noted there are all sorts of variables, including a
slow but promising downturn from the state's traditional loss of
young workers, plus a redefinition of retirement itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Close to half of the governor's Cabinet came out of retirement
to serve,'' noted Dudley, who is busy preparing for Underwood's
regional conference in September on the problems and opportunities
of the elderly. Next year, West Virginia will play a principle role
in the United Nation's International Year of the Older Person when
it hosts the conference on rural health.
</P>
<P>
   Hechler appreciates those issues but puts more passion into
railing against mechanized mountain-top coal mining and its effects
on the environment, citizenry and general attractiveness of West
Virginia now that all the retirees are flocking in. He has been
hiking the state on this issue, just as he has been hiking
nationally for campaign finance reform, a buoyant old New Dealer
come round one more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that's Ken Hechler,'' an elderly woman told her friend as
the candidate confronted them at the picnic. ``You ought to know
him _ he's been around 100 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Hechler, a whippet on the hustings, instantly responded: ``One
hundred years! Whoopee!'' And he asked if he might give the woman a
hug.

TRADE GUESSING GAME A TOUGH CASE TO CRACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ We ambushed Doug Melvin on his way to dinner
last night at The BallPark in Arlington. It was a cheap trick, but
all's fair in baseball when the trading deadline is fast
approaching.
</P>
<P>
   It was the classic strike favored by the Zulus, the flanks
spreading forward to each side like the horns of the African
buffalo, luring the victim into the center, where the real assault
can take place.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Rangers beat writer Johnny Paul and I
double-teamed the general manager. He had no where to run.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that's when our well-planned sneak attack began
to fizzle.
</P>
<P>
   I've squeezed more information out of dead men.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Seals threatened with going to bed without their supper are
more loose-lipped than a general manager two weeks from the July 31
drop-dead date.
</P>
<P>
   We played good cop-bad cop. We played good cop-good cop. We
played bad cop-bad cop. We played cops and robbers. We played ...
well, you don't think we're going to reveal all our trade secrets
here, do you?
</P>
<P>
   We even told Melvin if he didn't talk, he'd have to clean his
plate, which shook him up more than anything else we'd said. But he
still wouldn't come clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's called me offering pitching in two days,'' was the
GM's opening gambit.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Doug, and I suppose you really expect us to believe that?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, really,'' Melvin insisted. ``I've never seen it so quiet
this close to trading deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   Four scouts, two from Minnesota, laughed and joked a few tables
away. What about them, we asked Melvin. Guess they're just here for
the press box cuisine at eight bucks a pop, huh?
</P>
<P>
   Melvin shrugged and clamped his walrus mustache over his lips.
I've seen tough cookies before, but this guy takes the cake.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like Melvin wouldn't like to make a deal. His team
could use another positive bump in the rotation. But this is like
picking through a bin of used golf balls: You know darn well if
there is a Titleist in there, it's going to have an ugly scuff mark
or two on it.
</P>
<P>
   You've heard the names of all the usual suspects by now. The
Twins may have two scouts here, but they keep insisting they're not
going to dump Brad Radke. Ditto for the Phillies and Curt
Schilling, who apparently doesn't want to come to Texas anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he doesn't want to come here,'' second baseman Mark
McLemore said before last night's 9-8 victory over the
Diamondbacks, ``then we don't want him. Let him stay in
Philadelphia and keep losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Players are funny that way. They'd love to see the Rangers get
some help, as long as they're not the ones involved in the trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'd like to see them give up every second baseman
they have in the minors,'' McLemore said laughing. ``I know Doug's
trying to do something, but there are no guarantees out there. I
know we can't afford to give up any of our frontline players but if
we could get another starter who can keep us in the game, it would
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody _ and I mean nobody _ wants to give up Ruben Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   Which takes us back to the suspect list.
</P>
<P>
   The A's say they won't trade Kenny Rogers as long as they're
still in the race. Juan Guzman is available but he's about as
erratic as they come. Keep him in mind.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles are also hoping someone _ anyone _ will take Scott
Erickson, his 6-plus ERA and his ridiculously exorbitant contract.
It won't be the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The best starter out there might be the Dodgers' Ismael Valdez,
but LA is offering a package deal: Whoever takes Valdez also has to
take nonproductive, overpaid first baseman Eric Karros. That's a
total of $9 million, plus the players and prospects you have to
give up, to get a pitcher you want and a first baseman you can't
use. Besides, the Dodgers are desperate for left-handed hitting and
you-know-who _ the redhead _ ain't going nowhere. Forget it.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, there's Darryl Kile from Colorado, but he's in the
second-year of a $24 million contract that included a $5 million
signing bonus. Seems $3 million of that bonus, along with Kile's
base pay of $8 million, are due next season, making him an $11
million player. That's not happening here.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if Melvin hasn't pulled the trigger on these
deadline deals before. Last year he brought in Todd Stottlemyre,
Todd Zeile and Royce Clayton. In '96 he added John Burkett after
the deadline but in time to help during the Rangers' stretch run.
</P>
<P>
   What this team needs _ a bonafide ace who can help get them
beyond the first round of the playoffs _ just isn't out there or
isn't available. Not yet anyway. But there are lesser veterans who
could help if the price isn't too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about the playoffs,'' said Melvin, still playing
the tough guy. ``I worry about getting there first. Cleveland might
be the only team with the luxury of not worrying about getting
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, I'd do something if I thought it made sense.''
</P>
<P>
   A likely story. What, you think we haven't heard that alibi
before?

OFFENSE SAVES RANGERS AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers ask much of their offense.
</P>
<P>
   Their rotation and defense require it.
</P>
<P>
   The recurring storyline appeared again last night in the
Rangers' 9-8 victory against the Arizona Diamondbacks at The
Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers staged their second ninth-inning victory in as many
evenings when third baseman Todd Zeile drew a bases-loaded walk
from Dan Plesac to force left fielder Rusty Greer across the plate
with the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel confident that we're going to get that one run,''
Zeile said. ``Anybody in this lineup can beat you with one swing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' offense overcame:
</P>
<P>
   closer John Wetteland, who blew a save opportunity of the fourth
time in seven chances;
</P>
<P>
   a shaky performance from reliever Mike Venafro, who surrendered
two seventh-inning runs;
</P>
<P>
   and Zeile's fourth-inning throwing error that opened the way for
two unearned runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can just stay close, this offense can do a lot,'' said
dugout coach Bucky Dent, who managed the Rangers in the absence of
Johnny Oates, who attended his son's college graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Greer and Juan Gonzalez served as the Rangers' ninth-inning
catalysts by collecting consecutive singles against Arizona's Bobby
Chouinard (2-1). The Diamondbacks opted to walk Rafael Palmeiro
after a passed ball moved Greer Gonzalez into scoring position.
Zeile then drew a five-pitch walk.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers appeared to have this game wrapped up a half-inning
earlier, but Arizona's Matt Williams delivered a two-out,
run-scoring single against Wetteland (3-3). Williams' four-hop
ground ball evaded shortstop Royce Clayton and rolled into center
field to score Tony Womack with the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona took an early 2-0 lead after the Rangers were hurt by
their defense, again. Zeile's errant, fourth-inning throw resulted
in two unearned runs against Aaron Sele, who surrendered two hits
and recorded eight strikeouts before stepping to the mound for the
seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for Aaron Sele,'' Zeile said. ``He didn't deserve
to give up a couple of those runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeile's error gave the Rangers six in the past four games and 13
in their past 10 contests. The Rangers began play yesterday ranked
12th among the American League's 14 teams in fielding percentage.
</P>
<P>
   All appeared well, though, after the offense cranked out a
seven-run fifth inning, sending 11 men to the plate. Consecutive
run-scoring singles by second baseman Mark McLemore and catcher
Ivan Rodriguez tied the score, and a two-run double by left fielder
Rusty Greer produced the Rangers' first lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers continued to pound right-hander Armando Reynoso,
whose evening would be complete after surrendering the inning's
fifth hit _ a run-scoring single to Zeile that gave the Rangers a
5-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Greg Swindell replaced Reynoso and retired first
baseman Lee Stevens for the inning's second out, but center fielder
Ruben Mateo delivered a two-run triple before the former University
of Texas pitcher got out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Sele had given up only two hits before Arizona's Steve Finley
deposited Sele's second pitch of the seventh inning into The
Ballpark's upper-deck home run porch in right field, and David
Dellucci and Travis Lee followed with consecutive singles, ending
Sele's night.
</P>
<P>
   Dent summoned Venafro from the bullpen, but the usually reliable
rookie surrendered consecutive run-scoring singles to the
Diamondbacks' Nos. 8 and 9 hitters, Bernard Gilkey and Kelly
Stinnett.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Jeff Zimmerman entered the fray with Gilkey and
Stinnett in scoring position after a sacrifice bunt, but the
All-Star reliever could not protect the Rangers' 7-5 lead. Second
baseman Jay Bell produced a sacrifice fly that scored Gilkey, and
designated hitter Luis Gonzalez delivered a two-out single that
scored Stinnett with the tying run.

EDITORIAL: BELGRADE'S  ` CARE ' CAPTIVES  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, July 17:
</P>
<P>
   This week in Belgrade a panel of military judges heard the
appeal of three employees of the humanitarian group CARE, who in
May were convicted of espionage and given long prison terms _ one
of them 12 years. The appeal provides an opportunity for Slobodan
Milosevic to free these men, and end an apparently baseless
prosecution that opens all humanitarian workers to the threat of
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace, both Australians, and their
Serbian colleague Branko Jelen were charged with running a spy
ring. When he read the verdict, the judge threw that charge out,
but then declared the three guilty of passing secret information to
a foreign government or agency. The defense had not known of the
charge, and the judge provided no details.
</P>
<P>
   The information the workers held, CARE officials maintain, was
the same publicly available data on humanitarian problems collected
by all aid organizations. Ironically, they had been mainly helping
Serbian refugees from Croatia and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Mandela, Kofi Annan and others have appealed for the CARE
employees' freedom. But Milosevic has so far been unmoved, even
though the arrest has driven CARE away from Serbia when
humanitarian help is most needed. He has also used espionage laws
to arrest Serbian reporters who covered anti-government protests.
He should free the three men.  &QL;

LAWMAKER FOCUS OF INQUIRY; TRIED TO SERVE IN BALKANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials from Kosovo to Kayenta are
investigating an Arionza state lawmaker who apparently conned U.S.
Rep. J.D. Hayworth, R-Ariz., out of a trip to the Balkan conflict
in May by posing as a Naval reservist desperately trying to join
his unit.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Tom Gordon, who was working part time for Hayworth,
wasn't even an active Naval reservist at the time, according to
Hayworth's office. But with many of his state House colleagues,
there to see him off in May, Gordon hopped on a National Guard
flight at Phoenix's Sky Harbor International Airport that would
eventually take him to Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
   Hayworth has fired Gordon. And on Friday, Hayworth announced the
FBI and the Navy are conducting a fraud investigation. Hayworth
called for state lawmakers to conduct an ethics inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said late Friday that he would explain everything
eventually, but not until he spent time with his family. He said he
will meet with federal officials as early as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just come back from serving overseas and basically going
through six months of hell,'' Gordon said. ``Lots of things need to
be explained, and in due course, they will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I'm going to do right now is spend time with my
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was reached on mobile phone and would not elaborate on
where he was other than to say he was back in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Hall, an FBI spokesman, confirmed the bureau was in the
initial stages of an investigation, but he provided no other
details.
</P>
<P>
   The bizarre case stunned lawmakers, who described Gordon as a
bright, friendly man.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so strange, it's a bad B movie, James Bond-style,''
said Rep. Marilyn Jarrett, chairwoman of the House Ethics
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Hayworth, was unavailable for comment. But in letters to Arizona
House Speaker Jeff Groscost and Jarrett, he expressed outrage at
Gordon's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rep. Gordon lied to me and my staff and has acted in a manner
that I believe is inconsistent with the high ethical standards
people expect of their elected representatives,'' Hayworth said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The mess began in late April, when Gordon, 41, told House
colleagues he had been called up by his Naval Reserve unit for
action in the Balkans. On his House biography, Gordon lists service
in the U.S. Navy from 1984 to 1987 and duty in the Naval Reserves
since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Several local units reported for duty around May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Many colleagues, including Groscost, believed Gordon was a Navy
SEAL.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said he was a Naval officer with SEAL Unit 1 primarily
dealing with intelligence, but clarified he was not a SEAL.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Eule, a Hayworth spokesman, said Gordon contacted Hayworth's
office and said he was having trouble joining his unit in Bosnia
and needed help catching a National Guard flight.
</P>
<P>
   Hayworth gave Gordon a congressional travel order, which Eule
said was not unusual. He explained that members of Congress have
the ability to issue such orders, as if they were military
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Eule said the office didn't request to see Gordon's military
orders, adding that there was no reason to suspect anything
unusual. At the time, Gordon was working part time for Hayworth,
providing constituent services in northern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   According to Eule, Gordon used bogus travel documents ``obtained
under false pretenses'' to go to the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no reason to doubt he wasn't a Naval reservist,'' Eule
said. ``Sure, we believed him.''
</P>
<P>
   As he left Phoenix around May 1, Groscost and other House
colleagues paid tribute to him on the House floor and went to the
airport to see him off. Rep. Wes Marsh put a yellow ribbon on his
desk on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next is unclear. Gordon flew to Virginia and then
to Europe, spending time, apparently, in both Germany and Italy
before ultimately arriving in Bosnia. Once he got there, he
apparently approached several units and tried to persuade them to
activate him.
</P>
<P>
   In early to mid-June, an Army official called Hayworth's office
to inquire about Gordon. Eule said it was then that Hayworth
discovered Gordon had never been called into service and a search
began for Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   The official told Hayworth that Gordon was involved in
``unauthorized and disruptive activities in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous efforts to contact Gordon in Europe failed, Eule said.
When he left, Gordon was placed on furlough, which means he wasn't
being paid by Congress. He was fired June 22.
</P>
<P>
   The military couldn't locate him until last week, when he was
detained at a base in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear what Gordon was doing from the time he arrived
until last week, Eule said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tragic situation, and it's extremely bizarre,'' Eule
said. ``He took advantage of a lot of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's colleagues at the state House were floored by the
allegations. He was encouraged by Groscost to run in the heavily
Democratic district, winning a seat when Democrats failed to
qualify a candidate for the ballot. The district covers much of
northeastern Arizona, including the Navajo Nation.
</P>
<P>
   House members considered Gordon an intelligent colleague with a
bright political future, a belief backed up by credentials he lists
on his resume.
</P>
<P>
   Brigham Young University officials confirmed that Gordon
graduated with a degree in political science in 1982. He also lists
a graduate degree from Harvard in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Huffman, a fellow freshman who sat next to Gordon,
said he never doubted his military background. Huffman is a Naval
reservist and said the two talked often about his impending
deployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he had his orders, that he had been in contact with
his unit and that he was trying to delay it so he could finish the
legislative session,'' Huffman said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ken Cheuvront, who also sat near Gordon on the floor, said
Gordon had talked about being stationed in Beirut and in Berlin
before the Berlin Wall came down in 1989. Many members thought he
was doing intelligence work.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us assumed he was working for the CIA or the FBI,''
Cheuvront said. ``None of us questioned anything because of his
military background. He was a very bright guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is fluent in several languages, including Navajo. He
worked for Sen. John McCain's Washington office, handling Native
American issues from March 1997 until January of 1998. But Nancy
Ives, a McCain spokeswoman, said Gordon was ``let go,'' adding she
didn't know the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said that he returned to Arizona ``for personal
reasons,'' and that he didn't like living in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Cheuvront added that he believed Gordon was having marital
problems. He missed a lot of votes toward the end of the session,
Cheuvront said, and told colleagues he had to be at home to take
care of eight children.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sylvia Laughter has known Gordon since the two were
students at BYU together. She said Gordon's wife contacted her,
saying she was concerned that she had not heard from Gordon for six
weeks. Some of his belongings had been mailed home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom contacted her,'' Laughter said. ``From what she had heard,
he had been kidnapped or caught by the Serbs, detained and
beaten.''
</P>
<P>
   Camille Gordon could not be reached for comment. Laughter said
she was baffled by the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any reason to believe what he shared with us
isn't true,'' she said. ``I'm not even going to question it until I
hear it from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Groscost was traveling and could not be reached for comment. His
spokesman, Paul Senseman, called the allegations serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would look for Mr. Gordon's resignation if they are in fact
true,'' he said. &QL;

REID'S TALENT IS ENOUGH TO RETAIN WBA TITLE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo, Pa.)   (rk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. _ It looked like an ominous sign when Kevin
Kelly entered the ring Friday night and the Australian flag one of
his cornermen was carrying was mounted on the pole upside down, an
international signal for distress. Kelly was an unknown quantity
going against David Reid, a well-trained Olympic gold medalist who
had won a world championship in just 12 professional fights.
</P>
<P>
   But as the match wore on at the Boardwalk Convention Center
ballroom, it was Reid who looked as if he was in the fight of his
life against Kelly, a longshoreman and former rugby player from New
South Wales, Australia, who moonlights as a boxer.
</P>
<P>
   In the end the prodigy prevailed, as Reid (13-0) scored a
unanimous decision over Kelly (25-5-3) before a crowd of 1,967 and
kept his WBA super welterweight title. Judges John Stewart and
Vargas Marcial both scored it 116-111 and Henk Meijers scored it
115-112, all for Reid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very game in the ring,'' Reid said. ``He was very
tricky. He took a lot of good shots. But I had the tools to win. I
thought it was close, but I thought I won.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid's victory came on the strength of sheer talent. And if
Fernando Vargas, Reid's Olympic teammate and 154-pound nemesis, was
watching Friday night, he liked what he saw, because Reid was very
hittable. Kelly did not have enough of an arsenal to take Reid out;
Vargas does.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never hit me,'' Kelly said. ``My strategy was to give him
lots of angles. It was close, but I thought I won the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Reid's first defense of his title, which he won with a
12-round decision against Laurent Boudouani on March 6. Between
fights, Reid had more surgery on his drooping left eyelid, moved
his training camp from Philadelphia to Denver and signed a new
contract with HBO.
</P>
<P>
   HBO did not deem his title defense against Kelly, the WBA's No.
1 contender, worthy of broadcast, however. The bout was shown on
the FX cable network, which has an agreement with Reid's promoter,
America Presents.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, 29, had vowed to put on a performance that would make HBO
executives eat their Nielsen ratings sheets. It was a tall order
for a boxer who did not turn pro until he was 22 and spent the
first couple of years of his career learning how to box. But he did
not embarrass himself.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly spent much of the first three rounds fighting while
backing up. He did not seem inclined to test Reid's speed or power.
When the 25-year-old Reid managed to catch Kelly, he stunned him
with some sharp punches under the chin. But Reid seemed reluctant
to put together combinations or work off his jab _ the things that
his trainer, Al Mitchell, has been preaching to him since he was an
amateur fighting for Olympic gold.
</P>
<P>
   As the fight went on, Kelly's confidence grew. In the fourth
round, he grabbed Reid's attention with a blistering
right-left-right combination. In the fifth round, Kelly dropped
Reid to the canvas with a looping left that caught Reid on the
chin. Reid sprang up immediately and did not appear to be hurt.
</P>
<P>
   In the next round Reid picked up the pace. But by the seventh
round his drooping left eyelid was completely closed, and it
appeared that he had just a sliver of vision from it.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly was trying to become the second aborigine world champion
from Australia. The first was bantamweight Lionel Rose in 1968. &QL;

MARINERS MISPLACE BATS IN MOVE TO SAFECO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It's not Safeco Field's fault. The Mariners offense, a
well-oiled machine for so many years, was sputtering in the
breakdown lane before moving to its new home.
</P>
<P>
   But the early _ OK, (begin ital) very (end ital) early _ returns
are in on the ballpark, and it's just what so many people thought
it would be. There have been no home runs so far, but Mariner
pitchers have allowed only five runs in the first two games here.
The problem is, the offense has scored only three.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's result was a 2-1 loss to the San Diego Padres and
Sterling Hitchcock. The loss was the seventh in a row for the
Mariners, who remain in last place. The rest of the American League
West won Friday, and Seattle fell to eight games out of first.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners offense continued to struggle. The M's have scored
seven runs in their last five games, and have not exceeded three
runs since last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like we go through these three or four times every
year,'' said third baseman Russ Davis. ``You knock on wood and hope
things pan out. I know they will. I can't see it lasting a long
period of time. It happens to the best of teams. This is a great
ball team and everybody knows it.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially Hitchcock, who played for the M's in 1996 before
being traded to the Padres for long-gone right-hander Scott
Sanders. Hitchcock worked seven shutout innings, outdueling Jeff
Fassero for his first win ever against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter who it's against,'' Hitchcock said. ``It's
not like I felt jerked around or felt I was treated unfairly when I
was here. I've got friends in that clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Those friends were not happy Friday, although Fassero was
encouraged about Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem like the ball's going to carry that well,'' he
said. ``... It's a lot easier to pitch here. You get to challenge
guys on 2-0, 2-1, throw it to the outer half of the plate and not
have them hitting it to the short right-field fence. It's nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero pointed to an at-bat against Quilvio Veras. He fell
behind, 2-0, and Veras took an outside fastball to the right-field
warning track for a fly out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over in that park,'' Fassero said, referring to the Kingdome,
``it's a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   There were two major differences between Fassero and Hitchcock
Friday night. One was control. The other was center fielder Ruben
Rivera _ who, alas, plays for Hitchcock's team.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero walked six Padres, while Hitchcock walked no Mariners.
Rivera went 2-for-3 and snuffed a Mariners rally with a sprinting
catch.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock issued four singles _ just two leaving the infield _
and doubles to Alex Rodriguez and Davis. Davis' came with two outs
in the seventh, and was followed by a Dan Wilson blast to right
center.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera sprinted after it and grabbed it on the run, ending the
inning. His night over, Hitchcock waited for Rivera to come in from
center, congratulating him before taking a seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked for the ball to fall in behind him. When it didn't, I
just went, `Wow,''' Hitchcock said. ``He's been doing that all
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night was the fifth time in his last seven outings that
Hitchcock has lasted seven, and the difference has been control.
After walking 16 over a three-start stretch, Hitchcock has walked
just 10 in his last seven starts _ and none Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take away a few early starts, he probably would have gone to
Boston (for the All-Star Game), too,'' said Padres manager Bruce
Bochy.
</P>
<P>
   Donne Wall came in for the eighth, and the M's seemed to welcome
the change. David Bell ripped a single up the middle, and David
Segui rifled a ball to first. It caromed off first baseman Wally
Joyner and right to second baseman Veras, who flipped to second for
the force.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. followed with a smash down the first-base line,
but it hit the bag, going for a single and holding Segui at second.
After a fly out by Rodriguez, Edgar Martinez singled to bring in
Segui, cut the Padres' lead to 2-1 _ and bring in closer Trevor
Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman struck out Jay Buhner to end the inning, and earned his
22nd save the next inning.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero (4-10) walked six batters, matching a season high, and
by the time he left the game had thrown more pitches _ 134 _ than
any M's starter this year. Fassero was fresh, having thrown only 73
pitches in a three-inning start last Sunday in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be happy to go out the rest of the season and have more
starts like I did tonight,'' Fassero said. ``You win more than you
lose this way.''
</P>
<P>
   But the offense has to come around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff pitched a great game,'' Davis said. ``I wish we could
have given him a win. I'm sure Jeff's happy with his performance,
and he should be. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting good pitching and not good hitting, or good
hitting and not good pitching. We need to be more consistent.''

   WASHINGTON _ It is impossible to pinpoint the moment when
America's successes in the 1990s moved from a topic of grudging
admiration around the world to a constant source of annoyance at
Washington's triumphalism to a rationale for mistrust and
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the clincher was envy over the Dow's dramatic ascent
from a little over 2,000 at the start of the decade to a little
over 11,000 this year. Maybe it was the dawning realization that
people around the globe are all flicking on the same Windows
operating system in the morning, on their way to navigating an
Internet dominated by U.S. innovations and businesses and driven by
Intel inside everything. Maybe it was when the United States, in
the wake of the Asian economic crisis, began offering tutorials on
American-style capitalism, and insisting that the world's financial
architecture be rebuilt to American building codes.
</P>
<P>
   But surely the capstone was Kosovo. Whether Washington intended
this outcome or not, the war demonstrated to allies and potential
adversaries alike how much more formidable U.S. military technology
has become since the Persian Gulf War. Europeans got a rude
awakening when they learned that the gap between the United States'
capability and their own had so widened that they now have to
rethink their we'll-build-it-on-the-Continent mentality.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing sent a greater chill through the Kremlin and the
Chinese leaders' compound next to the Forbidden City than the image
of those B-2 bombers lazily lifting into the air over Missouri at
midday, flying an 11,000-mile, 32-hour mission to drop laser-guided
weapons over Belgrade, Yugoslavia _ and getting back in time for
dinner the next evening. Feeling the need to stake out some ground,
Moscow hastily flew a ragtag force into Kosovo, and Beijing boasted
last week that it had the neutron bomb _ don't-mess-with-us
messages that undercut the Clinton administration's talk of
strategic partnerships with old Cold War adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the world looks very different to Americans, who have
already moved beyond the Kosovo war. In the national self-image,
America's pillars of global power _ unparalleled financial clout,
unmatched technological prowess and unchallenged military reach _
are separate entities, bits of a far more fragile mosaic. Sure,
times are good, but Americans don't feel particularly powerful now,
even with the Russians broke, the Chinese consumed with
unemployment and slowing growth, and the Japanese unable to get
their breath back.
</P>
<P>
   But talk to Thai politicians stewing over what they view as an
American conspiracy to keep their candidate from running the World
Trade Organization, or scan the People's Daily, or listen to talk
radio in Toronto, and it becomes clear that America's triple threat
_ the dollar, the Pentium III chip and the B-2 _ is now also its
biggest diplomatic challenge. It may be a case of being too
powerful for one's own good.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Michael Mandelbaum, a professor at Johns Hopkins
University, puts it, ``If you are the 800-pound gorilla, you're
concentrating on your bananas, and everyone else is concentrating
on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the reactions differ dramatically when America talks
to friends like the Western Europeans and to potentially hostile
powers. Nonetheless, officials at the State Department, the
Treasury and the Pentagon, who agree on precious little, all say
fear of America's widening lead has become the subtext of nearly
every major conversation they hold around the world.
</P>
<P>
   It underlies Europe's near-panic over the precipitous fall of
the euro, the new currency meant to represent a more economically
powerful Europe. And it underlies Russia's perpetual negotiations
to avoid national default, in which Moscow fights every step of the
way as the International Monetary Fund _ synonymous with Washington
in the Russian view _ demands economic reforms in return for aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need is a policy of strategic reassurance,'' a Clinton
administration official lamented, ``a way of demonstrating that not
only is this power benign, but that it isn't a zero-sum game.''

</P>
<P>
   But turning that desire into policy isn't easy. The new treasury
secretary, Lawrence Summers, warns against trying to fix the world,
noting that ``we cannot want prosperity and reform in any country
more than its people do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our challenge,'' he says, ``to succeed as the first
outward-looking, non-imperialist, continental superpower.'' The
unspoken comparison is with the old Soviet Union, which was
continental but expansionist and the continental but inward-looking
China.
</P>
<P>
   From other capitals, though, Washington doesn't look so benign.
Its push for more open markets around the world is often viewed as
nice ideological justification for speeding the pace at which more
efficient U.S. companies can drive their foreign competition into
the ground. Meanwhile, the White House jumps when U.S. companies
complain that low-cost imports are hurting U.S. workers: In the
past two weeks alone, Washington has announced restrictions on
cheap steel from Russia and Brazil and cheap lamb from Australia
and New Zealand. No matter how it defends such moves as legal
responses to ``dumping,'' from overseas it looks more like
protectionism.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that is puzzlement over the deliberately vague
``Clinton Doctrine.'' It doesn't get much press in the United
States, but everywhere else there is speculation over how far the
Americans might extend the principles of Kosovo, intervening inside
other nations' borders to enforce ``international values'' of
humanitarian treatment or human rights. Russia looks at Kosovo and
worries about Chechnya; China looks at it and worries about Tibet
and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   An intense decade of global competition and technological
innovation has only heightened the contrast between America's view
of its power and the very different view held by the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans struggling with 12 percent unemployment and Japanese
trying to emerge from a lost decade look at America's surging
markets and employment rolls and see a train speeding by so fast
that it looks uncatchable. When Americans look at the same facts,
many get as queasy as Alan Greenspan, wondering how long the boom
can last. (That insecurity, some economists think, has actually
helped spur America's growth, sustaining the pressure for
cost-cutting and productivity gains.)
</P>
<P>
   When foreign companies look at the pace of U.S. technological
development, they see a gap far greater than a decade ago. But
American corporate executives look over their shoulders and worry.
``You sense quite the opposite of triumphalism from CEOs,'' said
Jeffrey Garten, the dean of the Yale School of Management. ``They
feel they are in a brutally competitive world, and they think they
are in a race for their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The developing world holds a similar fear. The U.N. Development
Program issued a report last week arguing that the digital divide
is widening faster than ever. Twenty-six percent of Americans use
the World Wide Web, it said, compared to 3 percent of Russians and
a tiny fraction of a percent of the population of South Asia. The
United States has more computers than the rest of the world
combined. In other words, the faster rich nations log on, the
further they pull ahead of countries that aren't even plugged in.
But the closest the report came to advocating a solution was a
1-cent tax on long e-mails, with the revenue earmarked for
connecting up the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The perception gap grows whenever the subject turns to the
lessons of Kosovo and U.S. military power. Washington looks back at
the events of the spring and wipes its brow, relieved that it got
through with negligible casualties and no ground troops. It sees a
truly multinational mission: After all, there was Prime Minister
Tony Blair, feeling his oats, arguing for ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   The European allies emerged with a different view: The war was
won with U.S. air power that homegrown military technology cannot
match. Meeting last week in Washington to review the war, European
defense contractors and officials concluded that trans-Atlantic
mergers of defense contractors _ something both Europe and America
have long resisted _ are now inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese saw Kosovo through another lens. When Thomas
Pickering, the under secretary of state, went to Beijing last month
to explain the series of mistakes that led to the accidental
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, a senior Chinese
official said China believed that the United States was involved in
Kosovo simply to test its latest armaments, according to U.S.
officials who have reviewed transcripts of the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that we appreciate how this integration of
financial, military and technological power looks from the
outside,'' said Gerrit Gong, the director of Asian studies at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies. ``It makes random,
unconnected events seem like part of a plan for America to hog the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   This may be a problem without a solution. Perhaps it could be
eased with a little less talk of America as the ``indispensable
nation'' _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's phrase _ and a
little more attention to sharing technology and the wealth it
creates.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is not exactly the mood that Congress is in. Nor
is the administration so inclined; it is trying to get through its
last 18 months with no more ethnic wars, no more economic collapses
around the globe and no abrupt end to the age of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic progress is a Faustian bargain,'' concludes
Mandelbaum. ``You gain a lot, you pay a price. That's what
international politics is all about.''

   &UR; FOR SUNDAY AMs &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, July 18:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-DEATH-TOLL (Pristina, Yugoslavia) _ At least 10,000
people were slaughtered by Serbian forces during their three-month
campaign to drive the Albanians from Kosovo, according to war
crimes investigators, NATO peacekeeping troops and humanitarian
agencies struggling to keep up with fresh reports each day of newly
discovered bodies and graves. By John Kifner. (With map.)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CHURCH-SCHISM (Yekaterinburg, Russia) _ Set on the Ural
mountain divide between Europe and Asia, this city has long been at
the crossroads of Russian history. Russia's last czar was executed
in Yekaterinburg. President Boris Yeltsin began his political
career here as a Communist Party boss. And the local military still
boasts of its cold war role in shooting down Gary Powers' U-2 spy
plane. But Yekaterinburg is best known these days for the protest
that has rocked the nation's most trusted institution: the Russian
Orthodox Church. By Michael R. Gordon. (With photo, map.)
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-SYRIA-ASSESS (Washington) _ Three years after being
pushed to the back burner of Middle East peace negotiations, Syria
is back in the picture. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-STUDENTS (Tehran, Iran) _ Student leaders on Saturday
announced a temporary ban on pro-reform demonstrations, but pressed
the Islamic government on a long list of demands, including the
resignation of the country's chief of police. By Elaine Sciolino.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-TV-WAR (Mokhra, India) _ India has fought three larger
wars with Pakistan, in 1947, 1965 and 1971, but the last two months
of fighting in the Himalayan land of Kashmir that lies between them
has produced India's first televised war. In 1971, fewer than 1 in
200 of India's households had TV's. Now, it's more than 1 in 3. By
Celia W. Dugger. (With photo, graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   COLOMBIA-CRISIS (Bogota, Colombia) _ On Monday, the government
of President Andres Pastrana and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, the Marxist guerrilla group known to Colombians as FARC,
are scheduled to begin formal peace negotiations aimed at ending 35
years of civil conflict. But a rapidly deteriorating political and
economic situation has weakened Pastrana's hand going into the
talks, undermining prospects for peace and emboldening the rebels.
By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-TORTURER (Pretoria, South Africa) _ In his drab denim
shirts and army-style green sweaters, Eugene de Kock answers
questions for hours, rarely showing any signs of emotion. His face
is lineless, his eyes small behind thick glasses that make him look
more like the class nerd than South Africa's most notorious
apartheid-era henchman. De Kock's amnesty application, listing his
misdeeds, is more than 4,000 pages long. By Suzanne Daley.
</P>
<P>
   URUGUAY-LEFTIST (Reboledo, Uruguay) _ From Monday through
Wednesday, Tabare Vazquez fights cancer as one of Uruguay's leading
oncologists. From Thursday through Saturday, he runs for president
_ and along the campaign trail he wags his finger at smokers urging
them to ``lay off the poison.'' By Clifford Krauss. (With map.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY-MISSING-PLANE (New York) _ A small plane carrying John
F. Kennedy Jr. to a wedding on Martha's Vineyard was reported
missing early Saturday, and a search was under way off the coast of
New York's Long Island, officials said. The plane took off at 8:45
p.m. Friday and was believed to be carrying Kennedy, his wife
Carolyn Bessette, and her sister, who were heading to the Cape
Cod-Martha's Vineyard area where the Kennedy family was gathering
for a wedding, a source told The Associated Press.

   (EDS: For first edition, we are planning one main story. Among
the sidebars that are being considered is one out of Washington on
the FAA angle. Obituaries are also being prepared, should that
become necessary.)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   APOLLO-REFLECTIONS _ Over dinner a few weeks ago, a former
astronaut who walked on the Moon and one of the Apollo flight
directors got to skylarking about the good old days, something
people do when they think of their past receding and a big
anniversary approaching, in this case the 30th anniversary of the
Apollo 11 lunar landing on July 20, 1969. But without prompting,
they wondered in sadness and perplexity what had happened to the
good old days. Such were the bittersweet thoughts among some of
those of the Apollo generation as they began celebrating the time
when human beings first (and last) set foot on another world. By
John Noble Wilford.
</P>
<P>
   NAVAJO-MINE-DISPUTE _ John W. Fritz, an Interior Department
official during the Reagan administration, has long wondered why
his decision to increase the coal mining fees paid to the Navajo
Indians by hundreds of millions of dollars was blocked. He may now
have his answer. By Barry Meier. (With photo.)
</P>
<P>
   NY-SUMMER-SCHOOL (New York) _ Outside, summer beckons, with
bikes to be ridden, video games to be played, cartoons to be
watched, Barbies to be pampered for hours on end. But the third
graders in a Brooklyn classroom must set those pleasures aside for
now, ignore the teasing afternoon breeze wafting through the
windows and focus on the task at hand: to draw a picture from one
of three stories they have studied today and write a few sentences
about why they liked it. By Randal C. Archibold. (With photo.)
</P>
<P>
   ALA-MAYOR-RETIRE (Birmingham, Ala.) _ For the last 20 years,
each time he walked into the City Hall he transformed, Mayor
Richard Arrington Jr. has passed by the name T. Eugene Connor
carved into the building's cornerstone. But the sense of distance
between the snarling dogs of Bull Connor, the former police
commissioner who became the symbol of intolerance in the days of
the civil rights movement, and the placid, prosperous Birmingham of
today is due in significant part to two decades of quiet work by
Arrington, who will retire on Monday at age 64. By David Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   COLO-DNC-FUNDRAISER (Aspen, Colo.) _ Some Aspenites are upset
that the town government is absorbing the costs of a major
Democratic Party event next weekend that will include a visit by
President Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton. While
presidential trips are fairly routine in their security
requirements and the demands they place on the local venue,
Aspenites assert that someone else _ the Secret Service, the White
House, the Democratic Party _ should pay for what is essentially a
political event. By Michael Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   IRS-TAXPRO-WORRIES _ The IRS, operating under a new law and led
by a commissioner who calls taxpayers ``customers,'' radically cut
back on its traditional collection techniques: garnishing wages,
tapping bank accounts, placing liens on property so the government
gets paid first when the property is sold, and seizing businesses
and homes. Tax professionals say they are worried about lax
enforcement. By David Cay Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH-HOUSE-REBELS (Washington) _ A group of rebellious House
Republicans, in defiance of their leaders, are trying to pass much
tougher regulation of managed-care plans than the Senate adopted
last week and say they can win if they can force a vote. By Adam
Clymer.
</P>
<P>
   POWER-OUTAGE-INQUIRY (Washington) _ Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson will propose six steps to reduce electricity disruptions
in severe weather in a speech on Monday, including federal
investigations of power blackouts like the ones that plagued New
York and other cities this month, department officials say. By
Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-REPUBS-TAXES (Washington) _ Stepping up his attack on
Republican tax-cutting proposals, President Clinton said Saturday
that the cost of the tax bill moving through the House would rise
to ``unimaginable'' levels and threaten the nation's ability to
deal with its most pressing long-term problems. By Richard W.
Stevenson.

   JERUSALEM _ The warm and fuzzies have vanished from peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
   There is a cold-blooded quality to the resolution of ethnic and
territorial conflicts in today's world. Rosy visions of
multi-ethnic harmony, often imposed by outsiders, have turned
steely. Even the impulse to provide such visions as window-dressing
seems to be gone _ from the Balkans, Northern Ireland and the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak, the new prime minister of Israel, is determined to
be the great peacemaker of his country's history, to resolve
century-old conflicts once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   But the former general, while he has traded in his olive drabs
for an olive branch, does not spout a vision that could even
remotely be considered utopian. His hard-nosed peace, which he
presented to President Clinton in Washington last week, sounds less
like something positive and more like a double negative: not war.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, leader of the Labor Party, talks bluntly about putting up
``high fences'' between Israel and its neighbors. He primarily
describes peace as a way to enhance Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
   It is a baldly grim message compared with the idealism about
regional cooperation, even harmony, voiced by predecessors who
chose to wear the mantle of peacemaker. Barak's campaign pledge to
``separate'' from the Palestinians summed it up with a starkly
unromantic slogan: ``We are here, and they will be over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in the Balkans, there is very little official talk
any more of forging or recreating mixed societies. In 1995, Tito's
dream of unifying the South Slavs got a final nod in the Dayton
peace accords, which, for public relations purposes, were wrapped
in the rhetoric of harmony. But with Bosnia now rigidly divided and
the Serbs exiting Kosovo, there is little pretense of establishing
Serbian-Albanian friendship leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Even as it urges Serbs not to leave, NATO is reconciled to
separating peoples.
</P>
<P>
   It could be argued that peace has always been more about
exhaustion than aspiration. Belligerent parties finally realize
they are not going to reach their objectives through armed
conflicts; their people are tired of paying the price of sustained
warfare.
</P>
<P>
   But there does seem to be a change in the air, a new pragmatism
that sees the hopeful dream of peace with harmony as naive, even as
an obstacle to ending conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is a kind of battle fatigue with peacemaking, too;
conflicting peoples would just as soon carve out a conflict-free
zone and be done with it.
</P>
<P>
   In Northern Ireland, peace the concept has become truce the
(near) reality. Talk of integrating schools and sports has given
way to divvying up parliamentary spoils and ``decommissioning''
paramilitary weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to two Irish women,
Mairead Corrigan and Betty Williams, grass-roots peace activists
who preached inter-religious reconciliation _ and led a movement
that went nowhere. Last year's Nobel Peace Prize celebrated two
unapologetic partisans _ David Trimble, the Unionist leader, and
John Hume, the Irish Republican leader _ who attempt no straddling
of worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the continuing strains brought the pact close to a
breaking point when Trimble refused to let members of a new
power-sharing Cabinet be named unless the Irish Republican Army
began to disarm. Such is the tense and guarded quality of this
peace.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mideast, Barak is not playing games with his tough talk.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of Israeli-Arab battlefields and someone who
personally led missions to assassinate Palestinian terrorists, he
is not inclined to hold hands with Yasser Arafat and sing
``Kumbaya.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Barak could not bring himself to echo
Arafat's description of him as ``friend and partner.'' He raised
his eyebrows, said Arafat was not exactly a card-carrying member of
the B'nai B'rith and settled on ``partnerish rival'' to describe
him.
</P>
<P>
   But, beyond his personal feelings, Barak is also acting in a
perfectly calculated manner. As a leader, he does not want to go
beyond what the body politic can endorse. And he has decided that
the Israeli public cannot unite around a utopian notion of
peacemaking.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Following in the footsteps of Yitzhak Rabin, who was
assassinated by a right-wing extremist in 1995, any Israeli leader
intent on forging peace agreements is going to tread cautiously
through the ideological minefields.
</P>
<P>
   For Barak to dress up his peacemaking as a visionary thing would
be to risk violent social unrest at the worst or to face political
paralysis at best. Israelis are prepared to swallow the bitter pill
of making territorial concessions to the Palestinians and even to
the Syrians. Like Barak, they are ready to free Israel of what he
calls the ``burden of ruling the Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   They are not ready to take down the barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   This hard-bitten approach mediates between the grand neighborly
visions of some of Barak's leftist predecessors and the hostile
skepticism of the prime minister he defeated, Benjamin Netanyahu,
who said he believed in peace but never sounded conciliatory.
</P>
<P>
   No less than Theodor Herzl, Israel's founder, envisioned a
commercially integrated Middle East, although his writings reveal a
keen colonialist mentality. (``The creation of our state would be
beneficial to other countries,'' he wrote.)
</P>
<P>
   Decades later, when Abba Eban addressed the United Nations in
1967, he had a fully realized dream. ``In peaceful conditions, we
could imagine communications running from Haifa to Beirut and
Damascus in the north, to Amman and beyond in the east, and to
Cairo in the south,'' he said. ``The opening of these blocked
arteries would stimulate the life, thought and commerce in the
region beyond any level otherwise conceivable.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the unsentimental Rabin, Barak's mentor, spoke of ``turning
swords into plowshares'' and forging an economically integrated
region.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Shimon Peres, first as foreign minister under Yitzhak
Rabin and then as the prime minister after Rabin's assassination,
who became the Israeli leader most associated with the utopian
vision of peace with harmony.
</P>
<P>
   Peres scoffed at and continues to scoff at the notion of high
fences. He coined the idea of a New Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, he was mocked by many for his lofty thinking; one
remark _ that hotels would be of greater strategic importance than
checkpoints on Israel's borders _ is still repeated by his
detractors with contempt.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality of what is likely to transpire falls somewhere
between Barak's and Peres' visions.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what Barak says, the fact is that the Palestinians and
the Israelis are not ``here'' and ``there,'' not with settlements
dotting the West Bank and a large Palestinian population living in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In the immediate future, there is no real way to dissociate the
two, not when Israel mans the borders, collects the taxes, employs
100,000 Palestinian laborers and depends economically on
Palestinian consumers. And there will have to be cooperation if not
collaboration _ on security, on the millennial tourism business,
and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Barak may be calling greater attention to building fences than
bridges, but his new industry and trade minister, Ran Cohen, said
he plans to build industry zones ``in a massive way'' on the
borders between Israel and the Palestinian territories and perhaps
between Israel and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is peace without economic agreements?'' Cohen said in an
interview. ``Prime Minister Barak may not be highlighting it, but
it is self-evident that this lies in our future.''
</P>
<P>
   On a grass-roots level, too, there are scores of local
people-to-people projects that suddenly feel very free to flourish,
from collaborations between Israeli and Palestinian firefighters,
birdwatchers and tour guides to recent Internet chat sessions
between Israeli and Lebanese teen-agers discussing the bombardment
of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, then, the hard-nosed vision may be softened by
those infected with the more idealistic view of peace, or with what
Rabin referred to as the profit motive. ``No one will come here
because of our winning smiles,'' he said at an economic summit in
Amman. ``They all want to make money.''

who became the Israeli leader most associated with the utopian
vision of peace with harmony.
</P>
<P>
   Peres scoffed at and continues to scoff at the notion of high
fences. He coined the idea of a New Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, he was mocked by many for his lofty thinking; one
remark _ that hotels would be of greater strategic importance than
checkpoints on Israel's borders _ is still repeated by his
detractors with contempt.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality of what is likely to transpire falls somewhere
between Barak's and Peres' visions.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what Barak says, the fact is that the Palestinians and
the Israelis are not ``here'' and ``there,'' not with settlements
dotting the West Bank and a large Palestinian population living in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In the immediate future, there is no real way to dissociate the
two, not when Israel mans the borders, collects the taxes, employs
100,000 Palestinian laborers and depends economically on
Palestinian consumers. And there will have to be cooperation if not
collaboration _ on security, on the millennial tourism business,
and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Barak may be calling greater attention to building fences than
bridges, but his new industry and trade minister, Ran Cohen, said
he plans to build industry zones ``in a massive way'' on the
borders between Israel and the Palestinian territories and perhaps
between Israel and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is peace without economic agreements?'' Cohen said in an
interview. ``Prime Minister Barak may not be highlighting it, but
it is self-evident that this lies in our future.''
</P>
<P>
   On a grass-roots level, too, there are scores of local
people-to-people projects that suddenly feel very free to flourish,
from collaborations between Israeli and Palestinian firefighters,
birdwatchers and tour guides to recent Internet chat sessions
between Israeli and Lebanese teen-agers discussing the bombardment
of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, then, the hard-nosed vision may be softened by
those infected with the more idealistic view of peace, or with what
Rabin referred to as the profit motive. ``No one will come here
because of our winning smiles,'' he said at an economic summit in
Amman. ``They all want to make money.''

GOP REBELS THREATEN TO PASS A TOUGHER BILL ON MANAGED CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Mich., Ga., Iowa, Okla., La., Ohio, Texas, R.I., Pa.)  (mk) 
 By ADAM CLYMER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A group of rebellious House Republicans, in
defiance of their leaders, are trying to pass much tougher
regulation of managed-care plans than the Senate adopted last week
and say they can win if they can force a vote.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders, like the Republican-controlled Senate, are trying
to stand firm against any legislation creating a right to sue
health plans offered by most large, multistate employers. But
dissidents talk openly of working with Democrats and passing a bill
that would allow such suits while perhaps limiting the damages that
could be awarded.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, who call the Senate bill a sham, are pinning their
hopes on negotiations between Reps. Tom Bliley, R-Va., the chairman
of the Commerce Committee, and John Dingell of Michigan, its senior
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the possibility of agreement is pretty good,'' said
Rep. Charles Norwood, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley and Dingell are expected to meet on Monday. But the
mavericks are wary of the Republican leaders' control of the
machinery of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Greg Ganske, R-Iowa, who called the Senate bill, which the
White House has said President Clinton would veto, ``not much more
than a fig leaf,'' said he feared the leaders might try to bypass
the Commerce Committee and send the Senate bill, or some other weak
one, directly to the floor through the Rules Committee, which the
leadership controls absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of fair debate can we get out of Rules?'' Ganske
asked.
</P>
<P>
   But, like Norwood, Ganske made it clear that he would break with
his party on a procedural vote to get their proposals considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beat us if you can,'' Norwood said, ``but don't avoid the
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Three factors make the House a different playing field from the
Senate, where last week's debate seemed less focused on making a
law than on making campaign commercials, the sort that accuse an
incumbent of voting for excessive costs on health care or, on the
other side, favoring drive-by mastectomies.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' thin 223-211 majority is one factor that
distinguishes the House from the Senate. Last year, more for
campaign protection than in the expectation of getting a law
enacted, Republicans passed a modest patients' bill by only a
216-210 tally, and they lost six seats in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership of Ganske, who is a reconstructive surgeon,
Norwood, a dentist, and two other physicians, Reps. Tom Coburn,
R-Okla., and John Cooksey, R-La., is a second factor. Like many
other doctors, and the American Medical Association with whom they
appeared last week to denounce the Senate bill, they regard managed
care's spending controls as an intrusion and a threat to patients'
health. Norwood, Coburn and Cooksey voted with their party a year
ago, but cannot be counted on this time.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the issue seems to have a stronger political influence in
the House, where contested races can be influenced by a much
smaller expenditure of television dollars than it takes to sway a
Senate contest in all but the smallest states.
</P>
<P>
   A warning came through clearly in last week's CBS News Poll,
showing that 14 percent of Americans regarded health care as the
most important problem for government to address, the highest
percentage of any issue. Not only is managed care the health issue
most intensely fought over in Washington. It is matched only by the
need to insure all Americans _ on which no legislation is
contemplated _ as a public concern.
</P>
<P>
   In the poll of 722 adults, taken during the Senate debate, 49
percent said Democrats were more likely to improve the health care
system and 27 percent said Republicans were. The poll showed
growing hostility to health maintenance organizations and other
managed care plans. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus
or minus four percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   There may be little immediate political impact from the
legislative activity. Dr. Kathleen Frankovic, director of surveys
for CBS News, said, ``The public is clearly not paying close
attention to the details of the debate in Washington.'' But that is
no salvation for Republicans, because it means the public's
instinctive sense that Democrats handle health issues better goes
unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation favored by the dissident doctors in the House
would differ from the bill passed by the Senate in many areas
beyond the provision for lawsuits when patients claim they have
suffered from a denial of proper benefits.
</P>
<P>
   It would cover all health insurance plans, not just the large
ones governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or
ERISA. It would guarantee patients a right to appeal insurers'
decisions to third parties not chosen by the insurer. It would
require health maintenance organizations to offer their customers
the right to pay more to use outside doctors. It would prohibit
penalties against doctors who seek additional care for patients.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders hope to pass a package of bills offered by Rep.
John Boehner, R-Ohio. That package, basically what the House passed
last year, provides for a slightly less independent external review
than the doctors' bill, and does not cover plans outside of those
governed by ERISA or authorize the outside-doctor access in the
doctors' measure.
</P>
<P>
   It seeks to expand insurance coverage by provisions to enable
small employers to join pools to buy insurance at the lower rates
available to large purchasers. While it would not authorize suits,
it would subject health plans to prosecution if they disobeyed the
finding of an external review panel. But a central feature,
emphasized last week by Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, the majority
leader, is the absence of a right-to-sue provision.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had my son or daughter in the hospital and I was
concerned about their care, I would not be consoled by a lawyer
that says, `Well, the judge says six months from now we can get you
on the docket,''' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Boehner moved his plan through a subcommittee he
heads on the Committee on Education and the Work Force. A spokesman
for Boehner said he hoped to move it further as soon as possible.
But Norwood, a member of that committee as well as of Commerce,
said the Boehner measures could not win a majority on the work
force committee.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders have said they want to consider patients'
legislation during the week beginning July 26. But if they find
they do not have the votes, they could postpone action.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And whatever the House passes, if anything, would have to clear
a conference with the Senate where Republicans displayed remarkable
unity all week in fighting off amendments to broaden the impact of
their plan. Final congressional action could easily not come before
next year, and it would have to be quite different from the Senate
bill before Clinton would sign it.
</P>
<P>
   It seems clear that the Clinton administration would embrace a
measure close to the one the doctors are seeking, even if some
limits on suits, not in it now, were added. The administration was
ready to embrace a compromise offered on Thursday by Sen. John
Chafee, R-R.I., even though it barred punitive damages, because it
provided broader coverage than the bill the Senate passed.
</P>
<P>
   But the senator needed to prove that he had five Republican
votes, enough to force a tie that Vice President Al Gore could have
broken if all Democrats voted for the plan. Chafee said that in the
end his only Republican ally was Sen. Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee said, ``We thought we had more, but it didn't work out
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   In the House, it is not clear whether there are enough defectors
to overpower the leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of Republicans who egg me on, every day, to
get something done,'' Norwood said.

COMMENTARY: HOW MANY INNOCENT PRISONERS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One way or another Vincent Jenkins will be freed from the Green
Haven Correctional Facility in Dutchess County in upstate New York,
where he has served nearly 17 years of a life sentence for a rape
he didn't commit.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is when.
</P>
<P>
   DNA tests have ruled out Jenkins as the man who attacked and
raped a woman in a nature preserve in Buffalo in 1982. But it is
easier to learn to fly by flapping one's arms than it is to get a
district attorney to admit having sent an innocent person to
prison.
</P>
<P>
   So lawyers from the office of Erie County District Attorney
Frank Clark told me on Friday that they will not oppose Jenkins'
release on his own recognizance. And they will not oppose any
motion in state court to have his conviction vacated. But they will
continue to oppose the effort by Jenkins' lawyers to have a federal
judge rule that he should be freed because his innocence has been
established.
</P>
<P>
   Got that?
</P>
<P>
   This is a case in which the victim has said for 17 years that
she was attacked by one man, and one man only, and that he
ejaculated. And DNA tests, done in collaboration with the county's
own experts, have ruled out Jenkins as that man. And still the DA's
office is unwilling to concede that a tragic error occurred, and
that the wrong man was convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans would be shocked to learn how many innocent
people are behind bars in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins is represented by the New York City lawyers Eleanor
Jackson Piel and Barry Scheck. Scheck noted that the FBI has been
doing DNA testing in rape and rape-homicide cases since 1989.
``They only get the cases when there has either been an arrest or
an indictment,'' he said. ``Then they do DNA to confirm or exclude
the person. In 25 percent of the cases where they can get a result,
they exclude the primary suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Think about that. In one out of four of those cases, the wrong
person gets arrested. These are cases that carry extraordinary
prison sentences, and in some cases the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Said Scheck: ``How many of those people would have been
convicted had there been no DNA testing?''
</P>
<P>
   If even 1 percent were convicted, that would translate into
thousands of innocent people in prison, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you ask the question, `What about all the other cases
that don't involve biological evidence?' It's not like people who
are making identifications in rape cases are far less accurate than
someone who makes an eyewitness identification in a
purse-snatching, or a robbery, or any other crime.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not a subject that the criminal justice system has been
willing to honestly engage.
</P>
<P>
   Scheck is the co-director, with Peter Neufeld, of the Innocence
Project at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in Manhattan. The
two men have pioneered the use of DNA testing in criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   Scheck said 64 people _ more than half of them with the
assistance of the project _ have had their convictions overturned
as a result of DNA testing. In eight of those cases, the convicts
were on death row.
</P>
<P>
   Scheck said thousands of others ``have been exonerated after an
arrest, in the middle of a trial, things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Those thousands represent only a small percentage of the
individuals wrongfully arrested and imprisoned for serious crimes.
Scheck said that in 70 percent of the Innocence Project cases, the
evidence he would like to test can't be located.
</P>
<P>
   In the Jenkins case, Ms. Piel and Scheck have asked a federal
judge to rule that their client is innocent, and that therefore his
imprisonment is a violation of his constitutional guarantees of due
process and protection against cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
   A ruling in their favor would be groundbreaking. It would be the
first time a federal court cited innocence as the constitutional
basis for ordering the release of a prisoner. It would establish
that imprisoning an innocent person was in and of itself a
constitutional violation.
</P>
<P>
   The reluctance of prosecutors to admit that they have sent the
wrong person to prison _ even after incontrovertible evidence has
been produced _ is a huge problem. That, and the cumbersome
procedures of state court systems, makes it perversely difficult to
secure the release of the innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Piel, Scheck and Neufeld are trying to find a better way.
</P>

   TEHRAN, Iran _ Things are not always what they seem in this
country of high walls and black veils. Invasions, occupations,
foreign meddling and arbitrary rule over the centuries have have
made politics a dangerous game, and Iranians have learned some
survival strategies: improvisation, role-playing and even
deception.
</P>
<P>
   So it was natural that the unrest last week in Iran, the worst
since the early days of its 1979 revolution, produced images that
sometimes betrayed reality: There were students who didn't look
like students, policemen who didn't look like policemen, true
believers who weren't really true believers.
</P>
<P>
   Masquerade is a large part of the Iranian reality, and it helps
explain why events unfolded here with such a baffling series of
turnabouts and surprises: One day tens of thousands of protesting
students were in the streets, chanting for more freedom. The next
day an even larger crowd, summoned by conservatives, denounced the
students. And the following day a near-normal calm settled over the
streets, almost as if nothing had happened.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis started when students at Tehran University
demonstrated to protest a tough new press code and the closing of
Salam, a popular newspaper supportive of Iran's reformist
president, Mohammed Khatami. Islamic vigilantes and security forces
stormed a dormitory, beating students as they slept and pushing
some from windows.
</P>
<P>
   For six days students _ whose ranks were probably infiltrated by
their enemies _ took to the streets, but the demonstrations
deteriorated into rioting; security forces and street thugs used as
surrogates swept the demonstrators off the streets with tear gas
and truncheons. Huge crowds followed up with government-organized
counter-demonstrations. This time the students stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   And then, as if a cloak had been swept over the events, a new
quiet left it difficult to figure out who had won or lost or where
or when the next battle would take place.
</P>
<P>
   One way to look at these events is as the latest scenes in a
national epic drama. The students' frustrations with the strict
Islamic system have been building for years. But before last week,
they were mostly expressed in private, much as the conflict between
Khatami's followers and Islamic conservatives has developed behind
the scenes. Once the frustrations burst into public view, the
play-acting that infuses much of Iranian politics accelerated the
chain of events, with each side reaching for the most dramatic _
even overdrawn _ way to make its point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iranians are like wheat fields,'' one saying goes. ``When the
storm comes, they bend; when the storm passes, they stand up
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Another goes: ``Iranians are like water in a vase. If the vase
is a globe, they become a globe; if the vase is long-necked, they
become long-necked.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for example, how Iran deals with Hafez, its great
medieval lyrical poet. He wrote love poetry in which lines of the
Koran are interspersed with lines about red-lipped, big-breasted
women and the pleasures of drink. When young Iranians study Hafez
in school, they are told that the wine he discussed was not an
alcoholic drink that caused intoxication but a divine drink that
caused mystical rapture. Even Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the
stern father of Iran's revolution, wrote Hafez-like love poetry. No
one would dare say he wrote about real women and real drink.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden about-face, too, is a familiar part of Iranian
history. On Aug. 2, 1953, 2.5 million people heeded the call of
their nationalist prime minister, Mohammed Mossadegh, and voted to
dissolve a Parliament he called obstructionist.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen days later, tanks poured into the streets in a coup
d'etat financed by the Central Intelligence Agency that ousted
Mossadegh and restored the monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   That day, his supporters stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   Often what is happening can be tolerated; the exposure of what
is happening cannot. ``Talk is more important than reality,'' said
one political analyst who, until the events of last week, was
accustomed to speaking outside the shelter of anonymity. ``Everyone
knows that dogs pee in graveyards. But one of the worst things you
can say to someone is, `A dog peed on your father's grave.'''
</P>
<P>
   So it was perfectly acceptable when people complained about
Iran's supreme-leader-for-life, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in private.
But when people appeared in the streets calling for the downfall of
dictators in general and for Ayatollah Khamenei's resignation in
particular, the regime had to reply _ not just by organizing the
counter-demonstration calling for the Ayatollah's long life, but by
playing images of that demonstration over and over on the
television system, which the Ayatollah controls.
</P>
<P>
   And it was perfectly understandable that the government switched
off Tehran's cellular telephones. Students involved in the
demonstrations on the whole were a privileged lot; they
communicated with each other, and with journalists, over their cell
phones.
</P>
<P>
   This was open talk, and it had to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating any effort to figure out who is who and what level
of protest is permissible is that Iran's clerical government is
split in two, but the sides have a lot in common.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's elected president has preached tolerance and the rule of
law. Ayatollah Khamenei cares more about keeping the revolution
Islamically strict and anti-Americanism high. And under the
Constitution, he holds more cards, controlling the armed forces,
intelligence and security apparatus, judiciary and radio and
television.
</P>
<P>
   But on television last week, the two men switched roles. Despite
his reformist message and friendly manner, Khatami is a cleric too,
and he is on record as supporting the Constitution and the concept
of supreme leader. As he has done before, he played the bad cop,
warning that the regime would do whatever it had to to keep order.
By contrast, the normally aloof, often strident Ayatollah Khamenei
played the loving father figure ready to sacrifice himself for his
children. At one point, he confessed mournfully that the violence
at the dormitory had broken his heart.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the other television images distorted reality. On the
day of the pro-government counter-demonstrations, television
broadcast footage of angry crowds from at least two dozen Iranian
towns and cities chanting ``Death to America.'' Paradoxically, the
streets were safest for Americans that day. Unlike the
unpredictability and chaos of the student protests, this
performance was planned and scripted, and the players knew just
what their roles were.
</P>
<P>
   It was left to the reformist newspapers to publish both sides of
the story and print the rest of the images, including photos of
students bloodied by vigilantes and female protesters crammed into
cages mounted on police cars.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets, what was safe one day was dangerous the next.
Iranian journalists who normally don't shave so they can blend in
with the Islamic purists on the streets decided to shave to fit in
with student demonstrators. When the purists took over again, the
journalists felt naked. Female journalists had it easier. They
could put on the black chador.
</P>
<P>
   Even reality itself deceived. A phalanx of young women swathed
in black chanting ``Death to America'' and punching the air with
their fists looked fearsome on the day of the anti-student
demonstration. Until one noticed their feet. They were wearing
high-heeled, high-soled shoes, fashionable in the West, dead
giveaways that they were not as Islamic as they were acting.

they were mostly expressed in private, much as the conflict between
Khatami's followers and Islamic conservatives has developed behind
the scenes. Once the frustrations burst into public view, the
play-acting that infuses much of Iranian politics accelerated the
chain of events, with each side reaching for the most dramatic _
even overdrawn _ way to make its point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iranians are like wheat fields,'' one saying goes. ``When the
storm comes, they bend; when the storm passes, they stand up
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Another goes: ``Iranians are like water in a vase. If the vase
is a globe, they become a globe; if the vase is long-necked, they
become long-necked.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for example, how Iran deals with Hafez, its great
medieval lyrical poet. He wrote love poetry in which lines of the
Koran are interspersed with lines about red-lipped, big-breasted
women and the pleasures of drink. When young Iranians study Hafez
in school, they are told that the wine he discussed was not an
alcoholic drink that caused intoxication but a divine drink that
caused mystical rapture. Even Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the
stern father of Iran's revolution, wrote Hafez-like love poetry. No
one would dare say he wrote about real women and real drink.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden about-face, too, is a familiar part of Iranian
history. On Aug. 2, 1953, 2.5 million people heeded the call of
their nationalist prime minister, Mohammed Mossadegh, and voted to
dissolve a Parliament he called obstructionist.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen days later, tanks poured into the streets in a coup
d'etat financed by the Central Intelligence Agency that ousted
Mossadegh and restored the monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   That day, his supporters stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   Often what is happening can be tolerated; the exposure of what
is happening cannot. ``Talk is more important than reality,'' said
one political analyst who, until the events of last week, was
accustomed to speaking outside the shelter of anonymity. ``Everyone
knows that dogs pee in graveyards. But one of the worst things you
can say to someone is, `A dog peed on your father's grave.'''
</P>
<P>
   So it was perfectly acceptable when people complained about
Iran's supreme-leader-for-life, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in private.
But when people appeared in the streets calling for the downfall of
dictators in general and for Ayatollah Khamenei's resignation in
particular, the regime had to reply _ not just by organizing the
counter-demonstration calling for the Ayatollah's long life, but by
playing images of that demonstration over and over on the
television system, which the Ayatollah controls.
</P>
<P>
   And it was perfectly understandable that the government switched
off Tehran's cellular telephones. Students involved in the
demonstrations on the whole were a privileged lot; they
communicated with each other, and with journalists, over their cell
phones.
</P>
<P>
   This was open talk, and it had to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating any effort to figure out who is who and what level
of protest is permissible is that Iran's clerical government is
split in two, but the sides have a lot in common.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's elected president has preached tolerance and the rule of
law. Ayatollah Khamenei cares more about keeping the revolution
Islamically strict and anti-Americanism high. And under the
Constitution, he holds more cards, controlling the armed forces,
intelligence and security apparatus, judiciary and radio and
television.
</P>
<P>
   But on television last week, the two men switched roles. Despite
his reformist message and friendly manner, Khatami is a cleric too,
and he is on record as supporting the Constitution and the concept
of supreme leader. As he has done before, he played the bad cop,
warning that the regime would do whatever it had to to keep order.
By contrast, the normally aloof, often strident Ayatollah Khamenei
played the loving father figure ready to sacrifice himself for his
children. At one point, he confessed mournfully that the violence
at the dormitory had broken his heart.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the other television images distorted reality. On the
day of the pro-government counter-demonstrations, television
broadcast footage of angry crowds from at least two dozen Iranian
towns and cities chanting ``Death to America.'' Paradoxically, the
streets were safest for Americans that day. Unlike the
unpredictability and chaos of the student protests, this
performance was planned and scripted, and the players knew just
what their roles were.
</P>
<P>
   It was left to the reformist newspapers to publish both sides of
the story and print the rest of the images, including photos of
students bloodied by vigilantes and female protesters crammed into
cages mounted on police cars.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets, what was safe one day was dangerous the next.
Iranian journalists who normally don't shave so they can blend in
with the Islamic purists on the streets decided to shave to fit in
with student demonstrators. When the purists took over again, the
journalists felt naked. Female journalists had it easier. They
could put on the black chador.
</P>
<P>
   Even reality itself deceived. A phalanx of young women swathed
in black chanting ``Death to America'' and punching the air with
their fists looked fearsome on the day of the anti-student
demonstration. Until one noticed their feet. They were wearing
high-heeled, high-soled shoes, fashionable in the West, dead
giveaways that they were not as Islamic as they were acting.

   SREBRENICA, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ After years of recalcitrance,
the Serbs finally capitulated here last month. Local Serb
nationalists allowed the majority Muslim town council _ elected in
absentia more than two years ago _ to take official control of a
town that has stood as a symbol of Serb defiance and brutality in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago this month, Bosnian Serb soldiers hunted down and
killed as many as 7,000 mostly unarmed Muslim men in the rugged
hills surrounding Srebrenica, a town the United Nations declared a
``safe area'' and vowed to protect. Since the war ended in 1995,
local Serb nationalists have used tactics ranging from endless
negotiations to rock-throwing mobs to prevent the town council from
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But in a scene hard to imagine only a few months ago, two dozen
Muslim politicians calmly sat down with 20 of their Serb
counterparts in the lobby of a local hotel on June 29 for the
inaugural session of the town council of the ``new Srebrenica.''
</P>
<P>
   Nesib Mandzic, a Bosnian Muslim high school principal who
unsuccessfully begged the Bosnian Serb army commander, Gen. Ratko
Mladic, to spare the lives of thousands of Muslims four years ago,
presided over the meetings as nothing less than Srebrenica's new
Muslim mayor.
</P>
<P>
   For the last month, Mandzic and other Muslim town councilors
have lived in the hotel under the protection of U.S. soldiers. This
summer they should be the first Muslims to move back to Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   Bent Jensen, a former Danish policeman who is the international
community's special representative to Srebrenica, said the
explanation for the Serb change of heart was simple. ``There are no
jobs,'' he said. ``People are having trouble feeding themselves.
They are on their knees.''
</P>
<P>
   For four years, the Clinton administration has used its veto in
the World Bank and other aid institutions to enforce what critics
call a heavy-handed blockade of most relief to Srebrenica because
of Serb recalcitrance. While Muslim and Croat leaders also thwart
some efforts by members of other ethnic groups to return to their
homes, Serb leaders in Srebrenica and other nearby towns are viewed
as the most obstinate in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the blockade, the 12,000 Serbs who now inhabit
Srebrenica _ most of them refugees from Sarajevo _ have spent four
years living in the crumbling ruins of a town with 80 to 90 percent
unemployment, no potable running water and a wretched sewage
system. The NATO bombing that destroyed the Serbian economy this
spring may have been the final blow. Many of the Serbs who had jobs
actually worked in nearby towns in Serbia, Jensen said. They are
now unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   The denial of aid and the NATO bombing may be having similar
effects in other hard-line towns in eastern Bosnia. Andy Bearpark,
the head of the international resettlement task force here, said
Serbs in towns known for defiance are taking initial steps to allow
some Muslims to return to their homes in exchange for Western aid.
``There is still a long way to go,'' he cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   Some Western diplomats cite the signs of initial success here as
proof that the same policy should be used in Serbia. The Clinton
administration is vowing to block most international aid to Serbia
until President Slobodan Milosevic is forced from power. But
skeptics have predicted that this policy would merely punish
ordinary Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Among Serb civilians in Srebrenica, resentment of the United
States and NATO simmers. A group of people selling buckets of
blueberries in front of a bombed-out building complained that the
new Muslim-led government was being forced on them.
</P>
<P>
   The suffering has also clearly bred resentment of local Serb
hard-liners. But whether that frustration can spark wide public
opposition to the Serb nationalists was difficult to predict. The
strongest sentiments expressed by the Serbs of Srebrenica as they
watched their triumph of four years ago slowly being reversed were
cynicism and despair, not anger and calls for action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old government was stealing the aid sent here,'' said a
Serb woman who would not give her name. ``The new one will probably
do the same.''

SPACE EXPLORERS REFLECT ON MOONWALKING NOSTALGIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over dinner a few weeks ago, a former astronaut who walked on
the moon and one of the Apollo flight directors got to skylarking
about the good old days, something people do when they think of
their past receding and a big anniversary approaching, in this case
the 30th anniversary of the Apollo 11 lunar landing on July 20,
1969.
</P>
<P>
   They laughed almost to tears telling cherished stories, one
trying to top the other, about the time men flew to the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Then a cloud seemed to pass over their faces. Without prompting,
they wondered in sadness and perplexity what had happened to the
good old days.
</P>
<P>
   Where were the astronauts on Mars? The permanent lunar bases or
the giant space stations wheeling through orbit? This was the
future that should have arrived by now, as prophesied in the heady
atmosphere of the Apollo 11 triumph. Both men _ the astronaut
Charles ``Pete'' Conrad Jr., who was soon to die after a motorcycle
accident on July 8, and the flight director Gerald Griffin _
worried that the United States had lost the old can-do spirit and
the will to carry out ambitious, expensive space endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   Such were the bittersweet thoughts among some of those of the
Apollo generation as they began celebrating the time when human
beings first (and last) set foot on another world. On Friday, the
anniversary of the day they rocketed off to the moon, the first
moonwalkers, Neil A. Armstrong, now 68 years old, and Buzz Aldrin,
69, visited the Kennedy Space Center in Florida for a reunion with
many who had worked on their mission. Michael Collins, 69, who had
piloted the Apollo command module in lunar orbit while the other
two astronauts landed on the moon, was invited but did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they had some post-Apollo regrets. ``I guess all of us
would like to see more things going on in terms of space
exploration,'' Armstrong told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He paused and grinned. ``The regret on our side is, they used to
say years ago, we are reading about you in science class,''
Armstrong said. ``Now they say, we are reading about you in history
class.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials, scientists and others involved in current space
projects have mixed feelings about such celebrations that dwell on
the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we spend so much time celebrating history, trying to
replicate history, we may never get a chance to make new history,''
Daniel S. Goldin, the head of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, said in an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   The concern is that Apollo, though worthy of tribute, should not
be held up as a model for planning space exploration for the long
haul. The project was not really about science or space
exploration, but the Cold War confrontation between the United
States and the Soviet Union. It was a crash program and too
expensive to be sustained once the immediate goal was achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Apollo program is not replicable,'' Dr. John M. Logsdon,
director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington
University, wrote in the current issue of Space News, a trade
weekly. ``It was a product of a specific time in history, as the
Soviet Union and the United States were using space firsts as a
surrogate battlefield for their global geopolitical competition. It
was definitely not part of a societal commitment to space
exploration and development.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As Logsdon recalled, in April 1961 President John F. Kennedy had
asked his advisers to identify a ``space program which promises
dramatic results in which we could win.'' The answer was a race to
send men to the moon before the end of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to conceive a similar question, 30 years later, for
which the answer is to send people to Mars _ or any other
Apollo-like space undertaking,'' Logsdon concluded.
</P>
<P>
   So many other things have changed between the time of Apollo 11
and now. Americans seem to have lost their taste for grand
adventures if they require longterm commitments of money and
expanded government power.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the Cold War, the Russians have gone from being
adversaries, whose early space triumphs provoked the moon race, to
allies. Indeed, they are partners in a $100-billion international
project to assemble and operate an Earth-orbiting space station,
though the financially strapped Russians often have troubles paying
their bills and meeting schedules. Other partners are the
Europeans, Japan and Canada. Major programs of human space flight
are becoming unaffordable, except through multinational
collaborations.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin conceded that Russian participation has added what he
called a ``Perils of Pauline'' element to the space station
project, now scheduled to be completely assembled in orbit in 2004.
The NASA administrator said he would be meeting with Russian space
officials this week to assess the implications of a recent Proton
rocket failure on Russia's ability to launch the Russian service
module for the space station on Nov. 12. Under current plans, no
further U.S. space shuttle missions can be launched to the station
until the Russian service module is in place.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the much-delayed station is operating with
international crews, human flight will still be confined to
circling Earth. No one has flown to the moon since December 1972,
or is likely to for years to come. On the 20th anniversary of
Apollo 11, in 1989, President George Bush called for a national
commitment to return astronauts to the moon and send them to Mars
by 2019, the 50th anniversary. His Space Exploration Initiative has
come to nothing fast.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Clinton administration issued a space policy
declaration giving highest priority to the space station and
restricting NASA from beginning any preliminary work on human
flights to the moon or Mars until after the station is in full
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alex Roland, a historian of technology at Duke University,
said that human space flight was still in its ``barnstorming
period,'' comparable to aviation before the 1930s. The development
of larger, sturdier airframes ushered in commercial passenger
flight. And military strategists began to conceive of the airplane
as an effective weapon of war. Human space flight, he said, has yet
to find an indispensable place for itself.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Roland suggested three changes that could bring
that about, none of which is likely to occur in the immediate
future. One would be a large-scale commercial exploitation of
space, like huge solar-power arrays that require people to maintain
them, similar to workers on offshore oil rigs. Fossil fuels would
have to be running low before that becomes likely, he said. Other
possibilities would be finding some military use _ farfetched at
the moment _ or developing much less expensive launching systems,
which could open up opportunities for commercial, scientific or
even tourist flights.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin agreed that launching rocketry is stalled with 1960s
technology _ ``middle age has set in'' _ and is a crucial area in
need of investments in new ideas and research. Logsdon said a
number of launch failures in the last year put renewed pressure on
NASA and the Defense Department to look at new investments in
rocketry.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the brightest stars in the post-Apollo space program
have been robotic spacecraft. They have scouted out all the planets
except for Pluto, rendezvoused with comets and asteroids and probed
the far horizons of the cosmos. They have landed and looked for
life on Mars, and will do so again several times over the next
decade. One is orbiting Jupiter and its large moons right now, and
another is on its way to orbit distant Saturn. The moon has been
revisited twice in this decade by modest spacecraft, which may have
found evidence of water ice at the lunar poles. At the end of this
month, after 18 months of circling the moon, Lunar Prospector is to
be crashed into the lunar surface to look for more definitive
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday morning, the anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon
walk, a space shuttle is scheduled to lift off on a mission to
deliver the Chandra X-ray Observatory to orbit, opening one more
window on the universe that had been closed before telescopes could
be placed above Earth's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   One more important difference from the Apollo days: the shuttle
Columbia will be commanded by Col. Eileen Collins of the Air Force,
the first woman to lead a shuttle mission.
</P>
<P>
   As the celebrations began, Neil Armstrong was asked what he
thought the lasting legacy of Apollo would be. It was, he said, ``a
demonstration that man was not chained to this planet.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Apollo, the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr.
predicted that in 500 years, the 20th century would probably be
remembered in history mainly for its pioneering space flights,
humanity's first venture beyond its native planet. He repeated this
assessment recently at a retrospective symposium on the vibrant,
tempestuous 1960s.

   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Embassy in Madagascar, a coffee-growing
island nation hundreds of miles off the east coast of Africa, might
not seem a likely target for terrorists from the faraway Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   But the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency are
worried that followers of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born terrorist
suspect, have had the U.S. compound under surveillance in
preparation for an attack this summer. As a result, the embassy has
been shuttered for most of the last month.
</P>
<P>
   The closing of U.S. embassies, those flag-flying symbols of U.S.
power and influence, was once about as common as a snowstorm on the
palm-shaded beaches of Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
   But in the year since terrorist bombs destroyed U.S. embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania and killed 224 people, 67 U.S. embassies and
consulates have been closed for some period of time for security
reasons. In June alone, six U.S. embassies in Africa were shut down
because of terrorist threats.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has no comparable figure for the prior
12-month period. But it says the number of closings in the year
since the August explosions in East Africa, which the United States
has blamed on bin Laden, dwarfs that for the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some of the swagger around here has disappeared,''
said a senior department official who has served at large embassies
in Europe and Asia. ``Once you treated the threat of terrorism as
the price of being a diplomat. You didn't demand resources for
embassy security. Now you do.''
</P>
<P>
   The embassy closings reflect both a heightened awareness of
security _ diplomats say they are much more likely to report
suspicious people loitering near an embassy _ and intelligence
reports suggesting that bin Laden's followers are about to strike
again.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials say the bombings in East Africa left
some U.S. ambassadors frantic about the vulnerability of their
embassies, and a number have flooded the department with requests
for better security or new buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Many U.S. diplomats were startled to learn after the embassy
bombing in Nairobi, Kenya, that the U.S. ambassador there, Prudence
Bushnell, had been pleading to the State Department for months for
money to build a safer compound; her requests had been turned down
for lack of money.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by the department found that 80 percent of U.S.
embassies and other diplomatic offices did not meet security
standards set in the 1980s requiring that the buildings be at least
100 feet away from the street to protect against car bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say that panic is the word, but there's a
tremendous amount of concern,'' said another senior department
official. ``We know these 2,000-pound truck bombs are a new,
ominous threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats, angered by bureaucratic delay in Washington,
have sought help from private security companies in the aftermath
of the Africa bombings. Bechtel, the giant San Francisco-based
construction company, says it has spoken with diplomats in Croatia
about improving security at the highly exposed U.S. embassy in
Zagreb, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorism is also taken seriously at the State Department's
headquarters in Washington, which has recently been ringed with
concrete barricades like those that surround the White House. The
department is considering closing the airy, glass-enclosed main
entrance, fearing it may present a tempting target.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to improve embassy security, the department's biggest
problem is, as always, money.
</P>
<P>
   The department received an emergency $1.4 billion from Congress
last fall to beef up embassy security, and the money has been used
for enhancements like alarms, closed-circuit television systems and
metal detectors, as well as for an extra 4,000 local guards to work
along the perimeter of embassy compounds.
</P>
<P>
   But virtually every security consultant who has studied the
problem for the government agrees that U.S. diplomats will remain
in danger until scores of old, vulnerable embassies are replaced
with new buildings, a project that will cost billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many embassy buildings that can't be secured,'' said
Jane C. Loeffler, author of ``The Architecture of Diplomacy''
(Princeton Architectural Press, 1998). ``Some are right on the
sidewalk. They have no setback, they're old, their walls aren't
strong enough.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, a State Department panel recommended a $14 billion
budget to improve embassy security over the next decade. But
Congress and the Office of Management and Budget have resisted a
commitment to anything approaching that amount because of budget
caps that the Clinton administration and Capitol Hill have vowed to
enforce.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials acknowledge that it will be years
before some of its most vulnerable diplomatic buildings are
replaced. Until then, Americans traveling abroad seeking help from
the local U.S. embassy had better get used to seeing a sign hanging
from a locked front gate: ``Closed.''

   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Embassy in Madagascar, a coffee-growing
island nation hundreds of miles off the east coast of Africa, might
not seem a likely target for terrorists from the faraway Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   But the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency are
worried that followers of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born terrorist
suspect, have had the U.S. compound under surveillance in
preparation for an attack this summer. As a result, the embassy has
been shuttered for most of the last month.
</P>
<P>
   The closing of U.S. embassies, those flag-flying symbols of U.S.
power and influence, was once about as common as a snowstorm on the
palm-shaded beaches of Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
   But in the year since terrorist bombs destroyed U.S. embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania and killed 224 people, 67 U.S. embassies and
consulates have been closed for some period of time for security
reasons. In June alone, six U.S. embassies in Africa were shut down
because of terrorist threats.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has no comparable figure for the prior
12-month period. But it says the number of closings in the year
since the August explosions in East Africa, which the United States
has blamed on bin Laden, dwarfs that for the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some of the swagger around here has disappeared,''
said a senior department official who has served at large embassies
in Europe and Asia. ``Once you treated the threat of terrorism as
the price of being a diplomat. You didn't demand resources for
embassy security. Now you do.''

   You would think the critical drubbing of ``Wild, Wild West''
this month _ on the heels of critical drubbings of ``The Mod
Squad,'' ``My Favorite Martian,'' ``The Avengers'' and ``Lost in
Space'' _ might give the slightest bit of pause to the original
thinkers bent on recycling defunct TV shows for the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   But no. Currently in varying stages of discussion, development
or production are motion pictures based on ``Get Smart,'' ``Hogan's
Heroes,'' ``Charlie's Angels,'' ``The Six Million Dollar Man,''
``Battlestar Galactica,'' ``Family Affair'' and ``Rocky and
Bullwinkle.'' Not to mention sequels to ``Mission: Impossible'' and
``The Flintstones.'' Live-action versions of the animated cartoons
``Inspector Gadget'' and ``Dudley Do-Right'' are about to be
released.
</P>
<P>
   These days, it's no longer a question of which TV shows, no
matter how crummy, become movies. The question now is which ones
don't. And the answer, increasingly, is precious few.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a year ago that virtually every '60s series of note
had been optioned,'' said Steven Rubin, a producer who has had an
option on ``Combat'' for years. ``A day did not go by before you
heard that a series was being revived.''
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed from the days when there was genuine popular
demand for cinematic updates of cult shows like ``Star Trek.''
Today, name recognition rules. An established concept, however
mediocre, often sells better than an unknown one _ and not just in
Hollywood. Hence Broadway musicals like ``Footloose'' and the
forthcoming ``Saturday Night Fever,'' and TV shows like
``M-A-S-H,'' all based on films.
</P>
<P>
   ``The term that comes up often in this arena is
`pre-marketability,''' said Rubin. ``Given the opportunity,
companies would prefer to bring in a property that has familiarity
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   It can make pitching a movie a snap. The producer David Permut,
who helped develop the film version of ``The Beverly Hillbillies''
and is hatching new incarnations of ``Green Acres'' and ``The Love
Boat,'' remembered how he sold ``Dragnet'' (1987) to Universal:
``It was the shortest pitch in history. I walked in and said, `Dum
da dum-dum.' They said, `Let's make a movie.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some are mystified at the ease with which old TV shows get the
green light, given the fact that the younger viewers critical to
box-office success have probably never seen the originals. ``What
baffles me is movies like `McHale's Navy,' `Sergeant Bilko' or `Car
54, Where Are You?''' said Lee Goldberg, executive producer of the
series ``Martial Law'' and author of ``Television Series Revivals:
Sequels or Remakes of Canceled Shows'' (McFarland, 1993). ``The
target audience is in their 20s or 30s, yet they weren't even alive
when the series was on.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, enough poor remakes have done well enough at the box
office that the TV-to-multiplex nexus remains viable. ``Dragnet''
was one of 1987's top 10 box-office draws. ``Wild, Wild West'' was
the No. 1 film in the nation over the July 4 weekend. (True, it was
pretty hot that weekend.) Mark Schwed, a columnist for TV Guide,
said, ``When `Wild, Wild West' makes $36 million on opening
weekend, that makes people say, `What other damn shows can we
do?'''
</P>
<P>
   So don't expect the TV dust-offs to abate anytime soon. But is
there no show that Hollywood won't consider recycling? Permut has
been approached to do remakes of such titles as ``My Three Sons,''
``Hazel,'' ``My Little Margie'' and ``Sky King.'' He has passed on
all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think every television franchise lends itself to big
screen treatment,'' he said. For his new ``Love Boat,'' Permut has
taken his cue from ``The Brady Bunch Movie'' and ``A Very Brady
Sequel,'' which won praise for their self-mocking spoofiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to take an innocent show and put a certain twisted
'90s take on it,'' he said. ``When I mention `Love Boat' to people,
they roll their eyes and say, `Oh, God _ They're doing that?' But
that plays into what I have in mind for it. It has to wink at the
audience. I have the trailer in my mind _ using footage from
`Titanic' and saying, `If you loved the last boat, you'll love the
next one.'''
</P>
<P>
   Permut also mused about getting Barry White to sing the show's
well-worn theme song and casting the rapper Snoop Dog as Isaac the
bartender. For ``Green Acres,'' he said, ``all the people of
Hooterville are devil worshippers in our version.''
</P>
<P>
   With a satirical approach, maybe nothing's out of the question.
Maybe ``My Mother the Car'' could star an exploding Pinto. Or ``
Ed'' could become a glue factory mogul. For Robert Justman, a
producer of both the original ``Star Trek'' and ``Star Trek: The
Next Generation,'' the formula's simple: ``A lot of bad taste and a
small helping of desperation.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Outside, summer beckons, with bikes to be ridden,
video games to be played, cartoons to be watched, Barbies to be
pampered for hours on end.
</P>
<P>
   But the third-graders in a Brooklyn classroom must set those
pleasures aside for now, ignore the teasing afternoon breeze
wafting through the windows and focus on the task at hand: to draw
a picture from one of three stories they have studied today and
write a few sentences about why they liked it.
</P>
<P>
   Their teacher, Shawn Hunt, is not pleased with the results. Some
have scribbled a few words. Thomas Johnson has written a fragment
of a sentence, without a period or comma in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know what a sentence is?'' Mrs. Hunt asks, a note of
dismay in her voice. ``That's a part of a sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas stares down at his paper in frustration, the same
feeling, he later says, that washed over him in April as he
struggled through the citywide English exam _ the beast that landed
him here, in mandatory summer school at Public School 41 in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hunt senses dejection, and calm returns to her voice as she
once again realizes how far behind these children really are _ how
far they have to go to pass the test that is their ticket to the
fourth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing wrong with you not knowing what a sentence
is,'' she says. ``I'm going to help you understand what a sentence
is.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, she says, driving the point home, ``you guys know
writing is part of the test, and when they ask you to write a
letter or a response on it, you can't just write one sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hunt and her 8- and 9-year-old students have just completed
the first two weeks of mandatory summer school, the keystone of
Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew's program to end the practice of
sending students on to the next grade whether or not they are
ready.
</P>
<P>
   This year, in the most ambitious and structured mandatory
program since the 1980s, 58,000 third-, sixth- and eighth-graders
are back in class for extra reading and writing, and to a lesser
extent mathematics, to prepare them for the promotion test in early
August.
</P>
<P>
   Mandatory summer school is expected to grow much larger next
year. Crew has proposed ending social promotion in grades 3 through
12, setting benchmarks on standardized tests, class work and
attendance that students must meet during the year if they want to
avoid summer school.
</P>
<P>
   The mandatory programs this year vary among the 32 community
school districts, but cannot exceed 10 students per class, and most
run five or six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is that at 9 every morning, Mrs. Hunt escorts her
seven students from the cafeteria, where some get free breakfasts,
to Room 224. The summer program, which began on July 1 and ends on
Aug. 5, offers a five-and-a-half-hour day to students drawn from
several nearby schools in this district of working-class and poor
families in housing projects and row houses.
</P>
<P>
   She reads to them in a loud, slow voice, and they read too,
haltingly and stiffly, deciphering vocabulary words like
``polish,'' ``scissors'' and ``ornaments.'' Then they often write
their impressions, since expository writing is a major part of both
the test they must pass next month and the statewide reading and
writing test they will face in fourth grade.
</P>
<P>
   She sings a ``good morning to you'' song, usually at Jose's
request. She scolds them for rudeness, for kicking one another
under their desks and for speaking out of turn.
</P>
<P>
   But she also seizes any opportunity to lift their spirits,
pointing out that she is from Brownsville too, went to public
schools here and made it to Howard University. (Mrs. Hunt, 30, has
taught fourth grade for seven years in Brooklyn, where her mother
teaches in the first grade.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want you to think you can't go to college,'' she tells
them one afternoon after reading a story that deals in part with
gifts of money for education. ``You can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now and then, she asks about their lives and dreams, finding a
way to relate them to the work at hand.
</P>
<P>
   What do you want to be when you grow up? she asked the other
morning. ``An astronaut!'' Thomas replied. ``An artist!'' said
Ozlen Adams. ``A wrestler!'' said Tommy Carmona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, Tommy,'' Mrs. Hunt said, ``you said you wanted to be
wrestler, and that's OK. But I want you to know you are going to
have to be able to read a contract if you do that, and that's what
you are here for.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hunt has not yet received their individual records, and so
is not exactly sure how far behind each child is; any student who
scored below the 15th percentile on the citywide exam last spring
was ordered to summer school. Based on their reading and class work
so far, she figures they are about a year behind.
</P>
<P>
   She is following a tightly structured lesson plan developed by
District 23, where this school sits and where summer school is of
particular importance. The district is ranked 25th out of 32 in the
city and contends with some of New York's highest poverty and
lowest literacy rates.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson plan, based in part on guidelines from the
chancellor, is closely linked to the city's reading and math tests.
It dictates which books to read _ an assortment of multicultural
works intended to make reading more interesting for these students,
who are mostly black or Hispanic _ and when to read them and even
what is written on the chalkboard. Mrs. Hunt learned the other day
that she must add ``mandatory'' to ``summer school, Class 3-224''
to remind students of the importance of being there.
</P>
<P>
   The children study these things during the year, of course, but
seldom in such a concentrated and focused way. Mrs. Hunt has to
pack a lot in, and she constantly watches the clock. There is no
scheduled recess. Mrs. Hunt has injected some fun into the lessons
by having the students do arts and crafts related to the stories
they have read; their colorful posters hang from the overhead
lights and enliven the drab room, with its pale aqua walls and
scuffed linoleum.
</P>
<P>
   Another important difference is the size of the class. Mrs. Hunt
has seven pupils now but may get closer to the maximum of 10 as the
district continues to track down parents who have not registered
children ordered to school. During the year, the average elementary
school class has 24 students, and Mrs. Hunt wonders how many of
these seven would be here if they had received the close attention
she can give them in summer school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, some just get lost and fall behind in a big
group,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that summer school has been free of problems. At first, Mrs.
Hunt had to bring in her own reading books because supplies had not
yet arrived; it was only last Monday that she received the final
batch of materials, including pivotal practice booklets for the
August promotion test. District and Board of Education officials
acknowledge that it has been a strain to mount such abroad program
days after the end of regular classes.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the weather. When the heat wave in early July
turned the classroom into a furnace, Mrs. Hunt brought a fan and a
water cooler from home. Still, flies buzzed, heads sank to desks
and eyelids drooped. (The Board of Education has begun putting fans
in all classrooms. Only a fifth of classrooms in the system are
air-conditioned.)
</P>
<P>
   But the constant and overbearing presence is that of the
end-of-summer test. Mrs. Hunt says that she and the pupils worry
about it but that she wants summer school to be about more than
passing the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really want you guys to do well,'' she told them. ``But I
don't want you to say you went to summer school to prepare for the
test. I want you to say you learned new authors, we colored, we
learned about genres. We learned a lot, we read, we did math and
also concentrated on our test skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in an interview, Mrs. Hunt said she would consider it a
significant accomplishment if her pupils could write a paragraph of
three to five sentences, with proper punctuation and spelling,
related to a story's theme. She is confident they will make
progress, but acknowledges they have a way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Here, for example, is one of her students' written responses to
``The Quilt Story,'' by Tony Johnston, about a homemade quilt that
comforts a pioneer girl and then, generations later, another lonely
girl:
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy the story because the girl liked her quilt, Because
her mother made it. When the girl in the story got sick the quilt
made her Better when she move she stell hade it and The end of the
story she still have it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of summer school, Mrs. Hunt had her students
write down their feelings about it and put the responses on a
poster tacked to the bulletin board.
</P>
<P>
   Jose: ``I am happy and excited because I will learn new
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy: ``I like summer school because if were home I would just
be playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Colin: ``I have a big smile because I have another chance to go
to the fourth grade.''
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks, they still say they do not mind summer school.
Their parents say they appreciate the extra lessons, though some
acknowledge they were surprised to learn their children were
failing.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Guzman, Jose's mother, said he generally took home good
grades. Mrs. Guzman said that she sometimes reads to Jose, and that
her 12-year-old daughter plays teacher to him.
</P>
<P>
   All the pupils said they had done a lot of reading in school,
and some at home.
</P>
<P>
   One day, Mrs. Hunt asked how many had library cards. Only two
hands went up, and when asked in interviews later what they did
most recently at the library, the two students said they had mainly
looked up the Web sites for MTV and the Backstreet Boys.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there are signs of improvement. Colin Bunbury, who
at first hardly spoke and seemed on the verge of tears when pressed
to participate, now jumps in gleefully. Ozlen, too, has perked up.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, the boy who had struggled with a sentence, surprised
Mrs. Hunt the other day on another assignment. ``Wow, a complete
sentence!'' she said, looking over his work.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas beamed.

<P>
   After jurors announced a staggering verdict of $4.9 billion
against General Motors on July 9, a juror explained the panel's
fury at the company. ``We're just like numbers, I feel, to them,''
he said. ``Statistics.''
</P>
<P>
   Message sent: The jurors concluded that the automaker had risked
lives to save a few dollars on each car, and they were incensed.
Rejecting the automaker's claim that it had been careful, the jury
set $107.6 million as the sum to compensate six people for medical
and other expenses after they were severely burned when a fuel tank
exploded in a crash.
</P>
<P>
   The exclamation point came in the punitive damage award of $4.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sending messages is the purpose of punitive damages, defined by
law as punishment for especially outrageous conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system awards punitive damages not out of concern for the
plaintiff but out of concern about the defendant's conduct,'' said
David W. Leebron, an expert on injury law who is the dean of the
Columbia Law School. ``It is to send a message both to the
defendant and others who might consider conduct like the
defendant's in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The award in the GM case is almost certain to be reduced by
appeals courts. But the case is the latest to highlight a ferocious
battle over whether punitive damages should be reined in, modified
or, perhaps, eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   The view that punitive damages give plaintiffs' lawyers a
windfall and provide little benefit was part of the Republican
rejection last week of a Democratic proposal to expand what are now
extremely limited rights of patients to sue managed health care
companies. Most patients can sue only for the value of the care
denied but cannot win punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, states are experimenting with new rules for
punitive damages. Judges and scholars are advancing new ideas about
how awards should be set. And some scholars and business lawyers
argue that the American legal system should join those of many
other countries, which do not allow civil juries to award punitive
damages at all.
</P>
<P>
   Under the banner of tort reform many state legislatures are
capping the amount of punitive damages people can recover.
Increasingly, state courts are striking down other new laws
limiting liability suits, saying they violate state constitutional
guarantees. But so far, challenges to punitive damages caps have
not met with great success.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more than any other legal device, punitive damages are
products of a view of the legal system as an economic tool. In a
free-market system, the thinking goes, the fear of financial losses
from private suits may work better than regulation ever could to
keep products safe.
</P>
<P>
   But as huge punitive damage awards have become Exhibit A for the
argument that the legal system is little more than a lottery,
critics have said the main contribution of punitive damages is to
inhibit business without making products safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't design and build a product to the standards of a
future jury in California, because you don't know what those
standards are,'' said Steve Morrison, a lawyer in Columbia, S.C.,
and a former president of the Defense Research Institute, a
national organization of trial lawyers who defend corporations.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, where he has defended manufacturers, Morrison said,
litigation of civil cases is more rational because punitive damages
are viewed as penalties like criminal sanctions that should be
sought only by government.
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars say the big American verdicts, and the fear of
them, result in ``over-deterrence,'' or excessive caution to avoid
litigation that hampers the free market system. Decisions about
product safety like the proper location of automobile gas tanks,
they say, ought to be left to regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Industry lobbyists offer a list of products like new drugs that
do not get to American consumers because of executive's fears of
punitive damages. According to the American Tort Reform
Association, a group that lobbies for limitations on liability law,
the risk of punitive damages reduced the number of companies making
football helmets in the United States from 20 in the 1960s to two
by the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of punitive damages have their own list of products
that have been improved after juries hit their makers with big
punitive damage awards. According to Public Citizen, a consumer
advocacy group, punitive damages helped convince manufacturers to
change the design of tampons that had caused toxic shock syndrome
and forced makers of baby pajamas to produce them without flammable
fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal scholars argue that judges traditionally give jurors
too much leeway. ``Juries don't have any guidance about how much is
appropriate to punish,'' said Polly J. Price, a professor at Emory
University School of Law in Atlanta. That, some experts say, has
created punitive damage inflation, as incensed jurors pick bigger
and bigger numbers out of the air. And some say juries should be
given formulas that take into account such things as how much it
would have cost to make a dangerous product safer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its most expansive
decision on punitive damages in an Alabama case. The decision left
a great deal of room for interpretation and did not adopt a
formula. It did say courts reviewing punitive damage awards should
consider the ``degree of reprehensibility'' and the ratio between
punitive and compensatory damages.
</P>
<P>
   The justices said a punitive damage award of $2 million was
``grossly excessive'' when the compensatory damages were only
$4,000 in a consumer fraud case involving a new BMW that had been
painted to cover scratches. The court said the ratio of $500 in
punitive damages to each $1 of compensatory damages was too big,
but it did not specify an acceptable ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Some states have passed laws setting dollar limits, like
$250,000 in medical malpractice cases. In other states, legislators
have focused not so much on the amount of the awards as on the fact
that the money was going to plaintiffs and their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   At least nine states, including Florida, Georgia and Kansas, are
experimenting with new laws that reduce the incentive to sue by
giving plaintiffs only a portion of any punitive damage award; 25
percent, for example, with the remainder going to the state.

 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pleas for justice are routine after an airplane
crash, and they are generally played out in civil courts, where
survivors and relatives of victims sue for damages. But last week,
in a surprising move, prosecutors won criminal indictments against
a maintenance company, two mechanics and a superior in the crash of
a Valujet plane in the Everglades in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   If the indictments were meant to be a warning to be more
diligent, some in the the aviation industry say they could have the
opposite effect. Fear of criminal investigation, they say, could
prompt airline employees and others to be uncooperative in
investigations into the causes of crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board's report on the Valujet
crash, issued in 1997, came after an extensive investigation that
relied in part on the participation of Sabretech, the maintenance
company, and Valujet. The worst the companies had to fear, or so
they thought, was a fine. But if jail time becomes a serious
possibility, companies may be less forthcoming in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, say the experts, seeking justice may actually
make it harder to get at the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this country, it's unprecedented to try to mete out
criminal punishment for an aviation accident,'' said Kenneth Quinn,
the lawyer for Sabretech and a former general counsel of the
Federal Aviation Administration. ``What we properly tried to do is
figure out what went wrong and why, and to prevent a recurrence,
and that is as it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the safety board concluded that Valujet had not
properly supervised Sabretech, which had improperly labeled and
packaged dangerous aircraft parts called oxygen generators.
Sabretech then delivered the packages to Valujet for shipment on a
flight from Miami to Atlanta. The plane caught fire shortly after
takeoff and crashed, killing all 110 people aboard. The criminal
charges filed last week echoed the safety board's findings.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of prosecution has conflicted with safety considerations
before.
</P>
<P>
   After a plane crash in New Zealand in 1995 in which four people
died, the police, hoping to gather evidence against the crew, went
to court and were granted access to the cockpit voice recorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's had the pilot community inflamed,'' said Stuart Matthews,
the chairman and president of the Flight Safety Foundation, an
international organization based in Alexandria, Va. ``We have been
very concerned about it. We strongly support the idea of
nonpunitive reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, prosecutors conducted an investigation of
the crash of a twin-engine plane that fell apart in flight near
Eagle Lake, Texas, in 1990. Maintenance workers had taken apart the
tail and left out several screws when they put it back together.
Ultimately, no charges were filed.
</P>
<P>
   And after the captain and first officer of USAir flight 5050
could not be located by the FAA in the hours after their plane ran
off the end of a runway at LaGuardia Airport in 1989, Queens
prosecutors considered bringing charges. The pilots reported in the
following day, and no charges were filed.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of prosecution has stymied a program in the United States
to study routine, uneventful flights for clues to future problems.
Several European airlines routinely download huge amounts of flight
computer data from their airplanes for screening in the hopes of
spotting potential trouble.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Scandinavian Airline Systems determined in the
early 1990s that 40 percent of its pilots were flying the airline's
newly purchased turbo-prop planes faster than the maximum
recommended speed. The pilots were accustomed to jets, it turned
out, and were sent for retraining, solving the problem. If the data
had not been studied, the problem might have gone undetected until
it contributed to an accident.
</P>
<P>
   But that system has been slow to catch on here because pilots
and airlines worry that the aviation administration might use the
data to spot rule violations, and seek civil penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are going to find something the crew is doing wrong,
and they are going to penalize the crew for doing it,'' Matthews
said, ``very soon you're going to have a situation where crews are
not going to be willing to have a flight data recorder on board.
It's a lot better to identify the problems and save that accident,
and save a lot of lives, than to shoot the messenger who had an
inadvertent mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   But others point out that some mistakes are intentional, or at
least grossly careless. In the Valujet case, Sabretech faces state
charges of murder and manslaughter, and a vice president and two
mechanics face federal charges of carelessly handling deadly
materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This crash was completely preventable,'' said Katherine
Fernandez Rundle, the Miami-Dade County prosecutor handling the
case. ``This was not an accident; it was a crime. It was a
homicide.''

   WASHINGTON _ Pleas for justice are routine after an airplane
crash, and they are generally played out in civil courts, where
survivors and relatives of victims sue for damages. But last week,
in a surprising move, prosecutors won criminal indictments against
a maintenance company, two mechanics and a superior in the crash of
a Valujet plane in the Everglades in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   If the indictments were meant to be a warning to be more
diligent, some in the the aviation industry say they could have the
opposite effect. Fear of criminal investigation, they say, could
prompt airline employees and others to be uncooperative in
investigations into the causes of crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board's report on the Valujet
crash, issued in 1997, came after an extensive investigation that
relied in part on the participation of Sabretech, the maintenance
company, and Valujet. The worst the companies had to fear, or so
they thought, was a fine. But if jail time becomes a serious
possibility, companies may be less forthcoming in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, say the experts, seeking justice may actually
make it harder to get at the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this country, it's unprecedented to try to mete out
criminal punishment for an aviation accident,'' said Kenneth Quinn,
the lawyer for Sabretech and a former general counsel of the
Federal Aviation Administration. ``What we properly tried to do is
figure out what went wrong and why, and to prevent a recurrence,
and that is as it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the safety board concluded that Valujet had not
properly supervised Sabretech, which had improperly labeled and
packaged dangerous aircraft parts called oxygen generators.
Sabretech then delivered the packages to Valujet for shipment on a
flight from Miami to Atlanta. The plane caught fire shortly after
takeoff and crashed, killing all 110 people aboard. The criminal
charges filed last week echoed the safety board's findings.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of prosecution has conflicted with safety considerations
before.
</P>
<P>
   After a plane crash in New Zealand in 1995 in which four people
died, the police, hoping to gather evidence against the crew, went
to court and were granted access to the cockpit voice recorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's had the pilot community inflamed,'' said Stuart Matthews,
the chairman and president of the Flight Safety Foundation, an
international organization based in Alexandria, Va. ``We have been
very concerned about it. We strongly support the idea of
nonpunitive reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, prosecutors conducted an investigation of
the crash of a twin-engine plane that fell apart in flight near
Eagle Lake, Texas, in 1990. Maintenance workers had taken apart the
tail and left out several screws when they put it back together.
Ultimately, no charges were filed.
</P>
<P>
   And after the captain and first officer of USAir flight 5050
could not be located by the FAA in the hours after their plane ran
off the end of a runway at LaGuardia Airport in 1989, Queens
prosecutors considered bringing charges. The pilots reported in the
following day, and no charges were filed.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of prosecution has stymied a program in the United States
to study routine, uneventful flights for clues to future problems.
Several European airlines routinely download huge amounts of flight
computer data from their airplanes for screening in the hopes of
spotting potential trouble.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Scandinavian Airline Systems determined in the
early 1990s that 40 percent of its pilots were flying the airline's
newly purchased turbo-prop planes faster than the maximum
recommended speed. The pilots were accustomed to jets, it turned
out, and were sent for retraining, solving the problem. If the data
had not been studied, the problem might have gone undetected until
it contributed to an accident.
</P>
<P>
   But that system has been slow to catch on here because pilots
and airlines worry that the aviation administration might use the
data to spot rule violations, and seek civil penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are going to find something the crew is doing wrong,
and they are going to penalize the crew for doing it,'' Matthews
said, ``very soon you're going to have a situation where crews are
not going to be willing to have a flight data recorder on board.
It's a lot better to identify the problems and save that accident,
and save a lot of lives, than to shoot the messenger who had an
inadvertent mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   But others point out that some mistakes are intentional, or at
least grossly careless. In the Valujet case, Sabretech faces state
charges of murder and manslaughter, and a vice president and two
mechanics face federal charges of carelessly handling deadly
materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This crash was completely preventable,'' said Katherine
Fernandez Rundle, the Miami-Dade County prosecutor handling the
case. ``This was not an accident; it was a crime. It was a
homicide.''

<P>
   After listening to the rancorous debate in the Senate over
health care reform last week, it would seem obvious that
differences between Democrats and Republicans are profound. The
Democrats wanted to give powerful new federal rights to patients in
managed-care plans. The Republicans countered with narrower
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The debate consisted largely of name-calling. Vice President Al
Gore labeled the Republican plan a ``charade'' and Sen. Tom
Daschle, the minority leader, called it a fraud. Among the
Republicans, Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas accused the Democrats of
deciding for political reasons ``to destroy HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   But the partisanship obscures an important truth: The
substantive differences are narrower than they seem. Removed from
the context of election-year politics, combatants on both sides
concede they could find ways to give Americans protection from
health-care plans that wrongly skimp on coverage. ``These issues
are eminently susceptible to compromise,'' said Ronald F. Pollack,
director of Families USA, a consumer advocacy group. ``It is a
tragedy that this became a partisan dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats jousted with Republicans over rival legislation
for a so-called patients' bill of rights. The Democrats' version
would have given patients new rights to appeal a health plan's
refusal to pay for tests or procedures, to sue health plans and to
choose specialists in certain cases. On Thursday Senate Republicans
passed a bill imposing less government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans know their bill will never get past President
Clinton's veto pen. Many supporters of the Democrats' bill
acknowledge privately that it overreaches and, besides, cannot
pass. Never mind. Obstinacy serves a political purpose. Next year,
Republicans will go fishing for campaign contributions from HMOs
and Democrats will do the same from trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats point to four critical disputes that
health care experts and lobbyists for both parties say privately
could be resolved through compromise.
</P>
<P>
   External Appeal _ Doctors and patients hate it when health plans
deny coverage for treatments that physicians deem medically
appropriate. Both parties' plans would address the problem by
giving patients the right to appeal to independent medical experts
from a list approved by state or federal authorities. These experts
would determine if a proposed treatment is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans would allow health plans to choose the
experts who review their cases. Democrats say that would encourage
reviewers to attract future business by siding with insurers. A
possible solution, according to some lobbyists, would be for the
Republicans to accept a system that would assign qualified
reviewers randomly to individual cases. That might prove more
complicated administratively, but it would address the Democrats'
objections.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICAL NECESSITY: External review would determine whether
proposed treatments are medically necessary. But Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy of Massachusetts and other Democratic critics say the
Republican bill would allow insurance plans to impose a restrictive
definition of necessary treatment that would bind outside
reviewers. The threat is that plans would cover, to take an extreme
example, only those treatments necessary to save a patient's life.
Under that crimped definition, treatments that merely relieve
suffering would not qualify. Republicans say their plan would not
allow for such abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' proposal, by contrast, would give treating
physicians a nearly unfettered right to decide what tests and
treatment are necessary, as long as they fall within ``generally
accepted principles of professional medical practice.'' But that
broad category could cover huge amounts of needless, expensive and
inappropriate care that often poses an unnecessary risk of injury.
Many health experts say the provision would return the country to
fee-for-service coverage, where doctors could raise their income by
over-prescribing treatments, assured that insurance companies could
do little but go along.
</P>
<P>
   One compromise that Democrats might accept, analysts say, would
put in clear legislative language the right of external reviewers
to define medical necessity. Reviewers would weigh the need for
treatment based on a preponderance of scientific evidence about a
procedure's effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   LEGAL LIABILITY: Under current law, patients in
employer-sponsored plans have little legal recourse if they believe
they have been injured when their plan denies them reimbursement
for care. The Democrats want to give patients the right to sue
health plans and collect sizable awards in such cases. Republicans
say an unlimited right to file lawsuits would produce arbitrary
judgments that would drive up medical costs and insurance premiums.
The Republicans also say the Democratic plan would put employers at
legal risk and provide a windfall for trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   One possible solution, experts say, would allow only those
patients who first refer their disputes to external review panels
to file suit against their health plans. Few lawyers would waste
their time taking a dispute to court after a review ruled against
their client. And few health plans would risk legal liability by
denying treatment that an external review deemed necessary. Sen.
John Chafee, R-R.I., proposed establishing guidelines for financial
damages, which could eliminate the lottery-like nature of many jury
awards.
</P>
<P>
   SCOPE OF COVERAGE: The Democrats want federal protections
extended to about 160 million patients in employer-covered health
plans, even those already under state regulation. The Republicans
say federal law is needed to protect only about 50 million patients
in large employer-sponsored plans that federal law exempts from
state regulation. Lobbyists maintain that if the two sides could
resolve the issues of external review, medical necessity and legal
liability, the Republicans might concede on the scope of coverage.

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ At least 10,000 people were slaughtered
by Serbian forces during their three-month campaign to drive the
Albanians from Kosovo, according to war crimes investigators, NATO
peacekeeping troops and humanitarian agencies struggling to keep up
with fresh reports each day of newly discovered bodies and graves.
</P>
<P>
   That death toll would be more than twice the number of about
4,600 dead estimated by the State Department in late May, shortly
before the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague indicted
the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, and four of his top
aides on charges of crimes against humanity. They were accused of
ordering the Serbs' push to purge Kosovo of its Albanians, who made
up 90 percent of the province's prewar population of 2.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting newly reported mass graves every day in all of
Kosovo,'' said J. Clint Williamson, a legal officer and leading
investigator for the tribunal. ``The list keeps growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon, for example, tribunal investigators and
British troops rushed off to a grassy roadside near the village of
Lukare, a few miles northeast of here, where three grave sites were
reported by local Albanians to contain possibly 100 or more bodies.
The Albanians said the valley had been along the route of a transit
march when Serb forces drove them from the north. The villagers
said their men were taken away from a column of about 500 refugees.
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, four bodies, all extensively decomposed, had
been exhumed and Lt. Col. Robin Hodges, a British spokesman, said
the work was likely to continue all day.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, villagers returning to Goden, a settlement near the
western town of Djakovica, discovered 20 bodies, along with
Yugoslav army log books describing how soldiers had emptied the
village and killed people.
</P>
<P>
   War crimes investigators here say they have been overwhelmed by
the constant flooding in of reports of new grave sites. They add
that the true toll may never be known, because many villagers
simply bury their relatives without telling Western officials.
Other deaths went unrecorded in the chaotic press of events when
peacekeepers and U.N. relief workers first arrived here a month
ago. Still other bodies may never be found, having been burned or
carried off by Serbs in an effort to destroy evidence, or are still
undiscovered, and maybe forever lost, in Kosovo's forests and
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time a villager comes back in, there are new body
findings,'' said an international official familiar with the
progress of the investigation. ``You're dealing with a crime base
that just keeps growing. It's just overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   The constant reports of new grave sites and a lack of
coordination between various international agencies have meant that
it is only in the last few days that investigators, peacekeeping
troops and others have been able to compile reports giving a
comprehensive view on the ground of the scale of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the new system of attempting to pull together the
information from all sources into an aggregate number for the The
Hague tribunal had produced a total of 201 grave sites with a
reported 4,900 bodies, according to Lt. Col. Robin Clifford,
spokesman for Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Jackson, commander of the Kosovo
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday afternoon, Williamson, the Tribunal official, said
the numbers had grown to 280 grave sites with more than 6,100
reported bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford, among others, warned that even those numbers
underreported the actual number of deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to keep track of this,'' the military
spokesman said. ``At first, no one was even keeping any of these
figures. A number of these bodies are being dug up by villagers and
reburied. You could have groups of three, four or five bodies that
do not get reported. We have a group of 30 unclaimed bodies and
that is not an unusual occurrence.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on these kind of numbers, war crimes investigators and
other international officials say there is no doubt the number of
ethnic Albanians estimated to have been killed during the Serbian
purge will reach 10,000, and probably somewhat higher.
</P>
<P>
   That estimate far exceeds, perhaps doubles, the total that could
be estimated from refugee accounts available to reporters and
others while the war was going on.
</P>
<P>
   While it is impossible to say with real certainty exactly how
many died, the estimate of 10,000 is lower than totals suggested
privately by some American and NATO officials before the war ended.
</P>
<P>
   But relatively few of the killings are likely to become part of
war crimes indictments issued by The Hague tribunal. Its
investigators are concentrating on establishing physical evidence
that supports the testimony of witnesses in a more limited series
of killings in which they hope to prove command responsibility on
the part of Milosevic and other high-ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, many of the killings might go without full investigation
or documentation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the teams of forensic experts and criminal
investigators sent to work for the tribunal by the United States,
France, Britain, Canada and other countries concentrated on six
specific sites of killings mentioned in the indictment brought
against Milosevic and his associates on May 27, seeking physical
evidence to corroborate the testimony given by refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment named the town of Djakovica and the smaller towns
or villages of Velika Krusa, Mala Krusa, Bela Crkva, Izbica and
Crkovez, and listed by name about 340 Albanians said to have been
killed in those places.
</P>
<P>
   Besieged by reports of more bodies, those investigators have
moved on to new sites, which tribunal officials say privately may
lead to new indictments of middle- or lower-ranking Serbian
officials. These officials might then testify against their
superiors about how orders were passed.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI team, for example, was assigned two sites in Djakovica,
but investigated five more there and two in the nearby region of
Pec. French investigators were frustrated at Izbica, when a widely
publicized mass grave in which they expected to find about 150
bodies turned out to be empty _ dug up with a backhoe and the
bodies spirited off, investigators said, between the indictment and
the arrival of NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   Only days later, though, they pulled the decomposed bodies of
eight women from wells in the destroyed village of Cirez, acting on
reports from local residents. ``It was not a pretty sight,'' said
Yves Roy, a member of the French forensic team.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, throwing bodies in wells, which poisons the water
supply, appears to have been a common Serbian tactic during the
wave of killings, along with burning down houses with bodies
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Of 44 villages in the district around Decani, for example, 39
had dead bodies in their wells, one of this week's daily internal
situation reports from the field to the United Nations High
Commission for Refugees said.
</P>
<P>
   While the tribunal's investigators are trying to set priorities
about which reports to investigate, they say they are becoming
overtaken by the sheer number of new accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start the day with a list of 10 things to do, it all
gets blown away,'' an investigator said. ``You get reports that
villagers are going to dig up graves and rebury people on their own
and you have to rush out so they don't destroy evidence. It's just
so widespread. Every little village has been hit. You want to do
the decent thing and respond immediately and at least record what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Every international agency working here has been deluged with
similar reports, often simply to make some kind of record of who
has been killed.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the tribunal's investigators, mostly hardened
detectives, the requests to identify victims have been touching.
Many people simply approach investigators, aid workers or
journalists in an attempt somehow to make the victims part of the
historical, or personal, record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very emotional,'' said Chief Superintendent John T.
Bunn of Scotland Yard, who said he identified at least 60 victims
in the village of Bela Crkva. ``The villagers were coming out
themselves to help us exhume the graves. There was a man who
uncovered his father and he wanted to be photographed with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the detectives appear stunned at the extent of the
killing. Chris Whitcomb, an FBI agent working at the Djakovica site
noted, as did other investigators, that they were working with the
resources that would typically be assigned to tracking a serial
killer in a big city, who might have claimed a dozen victims, while
here, in Kosovo, there are thousands of dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The destruction is just incredible,'' Whitcomb said. ``This
took a huge amount of effort. Home after home, street after street,
town after town. The sheer volume is astonishing. A staggering
number of people have been killed.''

   Whether it rains or freezes, and even if you don't have a
plastic Jesus on the dashboard of your car, you might have a hard
time avoiding reminders of God on highways across the country this
summer. Since last fall, billboards and signs bearing the messages
here have appeared on roads in some 40 states from Alaska to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   They were originally commissioned by a Florida resident,
insisting on anonymity, who paid the Smith Agency in Fort
Lauderdale $150,000 to produce a spiritual but non-denominational
ad campaign ``that people could relate to in a '90s kind of way,''
said the agency's president, Andrew Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The result was arch one-liners purportedly from God but
conceived by a very mortal Smith ad executive, Charlie Robb.
</P>
<P>
   After the billboards appeared last fall in Broward County in
Florida, the Washington-based Outdoor Advertising Association of
America took notice, and took the campaign nationwide. It persuaded
many of its more than 800 members, billboard companies and the
like, to display the messages as a public service.
</P>
<P>
   So far, they've appeared in 10,000 places _ a commitment of $15
million in ad space and production costs, the association says.
Last month the ads won the Smith Agency an Obie, outdoor
advertising's Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   Robb said that after working on campaigns for mundane products
like beer, becoming God's adman was ``bizarre.'' But he added,
``There is no downside to what we're selling here.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone's ecstatic. Some say the ads are too flippant and
slick a way of promoting God. And, in a bow to non-Christians, a
message with a reference to Sunday (immediately following) was
dropped when the campaign went national.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Fritz, an Interior Department official during the Reagan
administration, has long wondered why his decision to increase the
coal mining fees paid to the Navajo Indians by hundreds of millions
of dollars was blocked.
</P>
<P>
   He may now have his answer. On the eve of his 1985 ruling,
Peabody Coal Co. started a high-stakes lobbying effort aimed at his
boss, Donald Hodel, then secretary of the interior, papers recently
filed in a federal court in Washington show. Company lawyers even
drafted a memo, issued by Hodel, that told Fritz to withhold his
ruling, those records indicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden I got this thing flat out of the blue,'' said
Fritz, who now works in Wazata, Minn., as a consultant to Indian
tribes. ``It was the first time we had ever been specifically
instructed not to go ahead with the decision-making process.''
</P>
<P>
   Fritz's stillborn decision is at the heart of two legal actions
brought by the Navajos, including a civil lawsuit disclosed last
month against Peabody Group, the parent of Peabody Coal, and
others. That action claims that Peabody Coal and two utilities
unfairly influenced federal officials to derail Fritz's report, a
decision the tribe says cost it $600 million in lost mining
royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses and interest groups lobby federal officials all the
time and the government, Peabody Group and the two utilities _
Southern California Edison Co. and the Salt River Project _ said
they did nothing wrong. For his part, Hodel, now an energy
consultant in Longmont, Colo., said he did not recall the Navajo
coal episode but that he had always acted in the best interests of
the tribes.
</P>
<P>
   The Navajo lawsuit, like several other actions brought by tribes
in recent years, alleges that the Interior Department and the
Bureau of Indian Affairs failed to fulfill their unique mandate _
to act as trustees working to get tribes the best possible return
on valuable assets like natural resources and land leases.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the Navajos sued the government in the U.S. Court of
Federal Claims in Washington, claiming that it had breached that
trust in dealing with the same lease at issue in the Peabody Coal
case.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the government's role is limited to approving leases
negotiated between tribes and mining companies. In the case of the
Navajos' Peabody Coal lease, however, a provision in the original
1964 contract allowed the government to adjust the royalty rate
after 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the government or the companies named in the latest
lawsuit owe the Navajos anything remains to be decided. But
documents disclosed as part of the suit against the government and
Peabody Coal offer a picture of corporate efforts to sway Interior
Department officials, whose principal duty is supposed to be Indian
welfare, not company profits.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, lawyers for Peabody Group filed a motion in the Court
of Federal Claims accusing the Navajos of improperly disclosing
company documents as part of the tribe's lawsuit against the coal
producer. The lawyers asked the court to sanction the tribe and its
lawyers and to dismiss the Navajo claim against the company.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Bloxham, assistant attorney general for the Navajo
Department of Justice, said he had not had the opportunity to
review the Peabody filing and so could not comment on it.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Williams, a law professor at the University of Arizona in
Tucson, said lawsuits like the one brought by the Navajos against
Peabody Coal reflect a belief by tribes that the government allowed
companies to harvest their natural resources at rock-bottom rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indian tribes have their lawyers looking at decades of
mismanagement, and there is a gold mine in government
accountability,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the most sweeping case, a federal judge in Washington
ruled last month that a class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of
300,000 Indians nationwide could go forward against the Interior
Department. That lawsuit charges that the government failed to
properly manage trust accounts for decades containing billions of
dollars due those individuals from land lease payments and natural
resource royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Porter, a law professor at the University of Kansas in
Lawrence, said the Indian suits have had a mixed record of success.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1964, Peabody Coal has operated the Black Mesa and Kayenta
mines on Navajo and Hopi lands in northeastern Arizona. Peabody
Group, the nation's largest coal mining company, is owned by Lehman
Merchant Banking Partners II Fund and operates 35 coal mines
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Vic Svec, a spokesman for Peabody Group, said the mining company
has dealt fairly with the tribe, paying it standard fees. He added
that the company did nothing wrong when it presented its case to
Hodel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it is the fundamental right of every person and
organization to petition their government and that is what we were
doing,'' Svec said.
</P>
<P>
   One 1985 document written by a Peabody Coal lawyer reveals
executives' concerns that their efforts to lobby Hodel while the
royalty issue was under review might run afoul of complex
government rules that limit undisclosed contacts between federal
officials and parties to a dispute. But the company, the document
shows, decided to forge ahead and hired Stanley Hulett, a former
Interior Department official and a longtime friend of Hodel's, to
lobby the secretary.
</P>
<P>
   That memo also indicates that two company lawyers ``drafted in
large part'' the directive sent by Hodel to Fritz instructing him
to withhold his decision so that Peabody Coal and the Navajos could
negotiate a new deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been informed that that memo was delivered to Fritz's
office,'' a company lawyer, Edward Sullivan, stated in the
document.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz's ruling would have been the government's position on the
royalty issue, though the companies could have challenged it in
court. It would have upheld an earlier Bureau of Indian Affairs
finding that the Navajos should receive a 20 percent royalty on
coal profits. Instead, the tribe negotiated a 12.5 percent fee with
the mining company in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In their suit, the Navajos contend that they did not know why
Fritz's decision was never issued, and argue they would have
received more money if it had been. The $600 million they are
seeking from the government and the corporate defendants represents
the difference between a 20 percent royalty rate from mining
operations since 1984 and the 12.5 percent rate they collected.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navajo Nation knew nothing about what was going on the
other side of the table,'' Kelsey Begaye, president of the Navajo
Nation, said.
</P>
<P>
   Hulett, the lobbyist, said neither he nor Peabody Coal did
anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they wanted to do was negotiate a deal with the tribe
without the interference of the Bureau of Indian Affairs or
Washington,'' said Hulett, now an energy consultant in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Fritz, who was then the Interior Department's
deputy assistant secretary for Indian affairs, had to know that the
coal company was lobbying Hodel because he had told him.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz said that while he might have known about Hulett's
efforts, he had no idea that the company had a hand in Hodel's
directive. ``For years, everyone was denying that they had anything
to do with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The roots of the Navajo royalty dispute stretch back to at least
1984 when the Navajos and Peabody Coal were renegotiating the 1964
lease. Under that agreement, the Navajos, who derive about 25
percent of their income from coal, received a fee of 20 cents to
37.5 cents a ton, an amount that equaled a 2 percent royalty,
according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   That was far lower than the 12.5 percent fee that the government
had established in the mid-1970s as the minimum royalty for mining
on both federal and Indian lands. In the early 1980s, court papers
indicate, the Navajos and Peabody Coal attempted to strike a new
deal, but the talks broke down.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, an Interior Department official reported that the delay
was costing the Navajos, one of the nation's largest and poorest
tribes, $50,000 daily in lost royalties. Based on a Bureau of Mines
report, a regional director for the Bureau of Indian Affairs
concluded that same year that Peabody Coal could pay a 20 percent
royalty to the Navajos and still turn a sizable profit.
</P>
<P>
   The mining company and the two utilities, Southern California
Edison and the Salt River Project, appealed the finding, saying
that a 20 percent fee would make mining unprofitable and sharply
increase electricity costs to consumers in Los Angeles, Las Vegas
and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter, Fritz urged Peabody Coal to submit financial data
supporting its position, and a copy of the letter soon made its way
to Southern California Edison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps I misjudge the tone of the letter,'' a lawyer for the
utility wrote in 1985, ``but I think that the train is coming down
the track and the department is preparing to support the decision
of the area director.''
</P>
<P>
   By July 1985, Fritz's office had prepared draft documents
upholding the 20 percent ruling, court papers show. ``I was frankly
just waiting for odds and ends,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the companies and the Navajos were aware that Fritz's
ruling was imminent and would favor the tribe, court documents
indicate. But by then, the mining company had also begun to lobby
Hodel, urging that the royalties be negotiated by the company and
the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Hulett met privately with the interior secretary, who soon
signed the memo apparently drafted by company lawyers. It
instructed Fritz ``not to make an untimely decision'' so the
Navajos and Peabody Coal would negotiate, documents show.
</P>
<P>
   Navajo lawyers say that while they take exception to Hodel's
actions, they have found nothing to suggest that he benefited
personally from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was acutely aware of the trust responsibility that I had,''
Hodel, who until recently headed the Christian Coalition, said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz, who reported to Hodel, said the memo effectively put the
matter into his boss' hands, and that is where it stayed. The
Navajos say they were unaware that Fritz's decision had been put on
hold.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department would maintain that position for two
years, though court papers indicate that Navajo officials were told
in 1985 that Hodel wanted them to negotiate a deal with Peabody
Coal. They finally did so in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Begaye said the Navajos accepted the deal because they were
losing millions of dollars since they were still collecting a 2
percent royalty. Svec, the Peabody Group spokesman, said the new
deal for 12.5 percent, which was retroactive to 1984, was
consistent with the industry standard and that the tribe agreed to
the same rate in negotiations last year. He also said that the
tribe in the mid-1980s had plenty of advocates to press its case
with federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone was the outsider in this case,'' he said, ``it was
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Others may not be so sure. At a May hearing in the government
case, the presiding federal judge, Lawrence Baskir, said he was
disturbed by the undisclosed 1985 meeting between Hulett and Hodel
and its potential to ``infect'' the secretary's ``fiduciary
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department lawyer, R. Anthony Rodgers, said at that
hearing that the meeting and the memo that followed may have meant
little for the eventual outcome of the royalty issue. Hodel might
have made the same decision without Hulett's lobbying, the lawyer
said. But Rodgers also indicated that he would have preferred that
the meeting had never occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a practice that should be encouraged,'' he said.

ANALYSIS: U.S. VISIT BY BARAK PUTS SYRIAN ACCORD BACK IN VIEW 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three years after being pushed to the back burner
of Middle East peace negotiations, Syria is back in the picture.
</P>
<P>
   How to reach an agreement with Syria, one of the last Arab
countries still at war with Israel, dominated the first round of
getting-to-know-you sessions between President Clinton and the new
Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, officials familiar with the
conversations said.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a topic at Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's
breakfast meeting Friday with Barak and the State Department's
Middle East negotiators, Dennis Ross and Martin Indyk.
</P>
<P>
   Why Syria now? Mainly because administration officials believe
that a deal with President Hafez Assad of Syria is doable but that
it will require the involvement of the highest-level American
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The intense negotiations during the era of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, when former Secretary of State Warren Christopher
shuttled more than 20 times between Israel and Damascus, ended with
the election of Benjamin Netanyahu in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But that hard work might pay off now, as it defined the issues
to be negotiated, and in diplomacy that is often half the battle.
The overarching theme of a deal centers on the conditions under
which Israel would relinquish control of the Golan Heights, a
mountainous plateau seized from Syria in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Those conditions include the extent and timing of the Israeli
withdrawal, the size of demilitarized zones on either side of the
boundary, an early-warning station for Israel atop Mount Hermon,
which dominates the border, and the makeup of an international
observer force.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis are also insisting on ``normalization.'' In
essence, that means that Assad should stop supporting terrorist
groups, stop telling his people that Israel is the enemy and open
his borders.
</P>
<P>
   Progress was made on many of those fronts before Rabin was
assassinated, according to Itamar Rabinovich, the chief Israeli
negotiator and a former Israeli ambassador to Washington. But
precisely how much progress is in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Syria has insisted recently that 80 percent of the agenda is
done and that what remains is relatively easy and can be wrapped up
in a couple of months, if negotiations pick up where they left off.
</P>
<P>
   But the Israelis have not accepted that premise. One of the
subjects Albright discussed, according to an administration
official, was how to reconcile the differing views on where the
last rounds of talks actually finished.
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat with experience in Syria said that if the
Syrians and Israelis moved ahead more briskly than they did in the
last round of talks, the eagerness of the Clinton administration
was warranted.
</P>
<P>
   But the diplomat warned that the Syrian negotiating style was so
slow that even after an agreement, it could take months and months
to reach final wording on documents.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the issues, the Clinton administration is encouraged by
what officials are calling the ``mood music.'' Assad, 69, of
failing health and touched by the death earlier this year of King
Hussein of Jordan, has sent abundant signals about wanting to deal
with Israel now that Barak is in power. Administration officials
also believe that Assad would like to see the Golan Heights, lost
during his watch, returned during his rule.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Assad has to be sure that he is not seen as selling Syria's
interests short for the sake of his son, Bashar, who may inherit
his position.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the administration say they believe that Assad is also
looking toward the financial benefits that often come with a Middle
East peace deal. On signing the Wye memorandum last fall that
committed the Israelis and Palestinians to a land-for-security
deal, the Israelis and the Palestinians were pledged financial aid
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Assad has so little hard currency that when he visited Russia
recently on an arms-buying mission there were few of the usual
worries in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But envisioning Syria, a longstanding member of the State
Department's list of countries that support terrorism, as a
recipient of American aid is still a stretch for many in Congress.
But in the ``context of a comprehensive peace'' package, a senior
administration official said this week, Syria would have to be
considered.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the current focus on Syria, Barak has assured Washington
that he plans to forge ahead with the Palestinians and complete the
agreement reached at Wye. Traditionally, it has been political
wisdom in Israel that the Israeli public cannot accept two major
peace decisions at once _ like a deal with the Palestinians, and a
settlement with Syria.

   Race-Based Busing Ends in Boston
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, riots and rocks and beatings turned
Boston into the epicenter of national turmoil over busing ordered
by the courts to speed school desegregation. Now the Boston School
Committee has ended the last vestiges of that era by voting, 5-2,
to drop race as a factor in deciding which school a pupil would
attend.
</P>
<P>
   School officials, who have been examining the Boston school
assignment system for years, said they had to act quickly and
decisively because of a pending lawsuit by parents who say the
system discriminates against white children by giving them less
choice of which school to attend.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not keep some two dozen parents and advocates at
the committee's meeting from protesting that Boston was still far
from desegregated. Supporters of the move countered that they
wanted to focus less on race and more on improving education for
all.

   A Doctor Is Forced To Heal Herself
</P>
<P>
   An Air Force jet flew an emergency mission over the South Pole
last Sunday to drop medical supplies for a member of a research
team who discovered a lump in her breast. But the case is more
difficult than government researchers revealed: the patient will
have to treat herself, because she is the only doctor on the
41-member team at the isolated Antarctic base. Her diagnosis has
not been disclosed. Because of harsh winter conditions, she cannot
be flown out until October or November.

   Cruise Line Discloses Sexual Assault Cases
</P>
<P>
   Carnival, the world's biggest cruise company, disclosed in court
papers that its crew members had been accused of sexually
assaulting passengers and fellow workers 62 times in a five-year
period that ended last August. Though details on the incidents were
sparse, it was the first time anyone in the cruise industry had
disclosed statistics on shipboard crime.
</P>
<P>
   A company lawyer said the figures demonstrated that Carnival
ships are relatively safe. But lawyers for the people who claimed
to be victims, along with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and chairman
of the Commerce Committee, disagreed with that interpretation and
called on the industry to make a fuller disclosure of crimes.

   U.S. Sues Toyota
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department sued Toyota on Monday, accusing it of
violating the Clean Air Act and seeking fines that could, in
theory, approach $60 billion, although any actual verdict or
settlement would almost certainly be far less.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that Toyota did not properly program the
``check engine'' light on the dashboards of most 1996 to 1998 model
Toyota and Lexus automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   The lights would illuminate during regulators' laboratory tests,
but would not turn on during street driving even if traces of
gasoline vapor were leaking from fuel lines and the gas cap, the
lawsuit said. Toyota said that regulations only required the lights
to work during lab tests.

   A Vaccine Is Halted
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, health workers were elated when the first vaccine
against rotavirus, the most common cause of severe diarrhea in
infants and young children, was licensed and recommended for all
infants in this country. But the joy has now been muted; federal
health officials called for immediate suspension of the vaccine
because post-marketing monitoring suggested a link between it and
20 non-fatal cases of a painful blockage of the bowel called
intussusception.

   British Beef Readmitted To the World's Markets
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission lifted the worldwide ban on British beef
exports that it imposed three years ago after an epidemic of a
brain malady in cattle known as mad cow disease (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy) was found to be responsible for transmitting a
related brain-wasting disorder (new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease) to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Regulated feed, new standards for slaughterhouse hygiene and
computer tracking of herds are now in place to restore the good
name of a signature product in Britain. The country, after all, was
once so associated with red meat in Europe that Britons were known
in French as ``les rosbifs.''

   A New Regimen To Fight AIDS in Newborns
</P>
<P>
   Developing countries have long sought a simple, affordable way
to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the AIDS virus. A study
reported from Uganda last week suggested that it may be a drug,
nevirapine, that has been marketed in the United States since 1996.
Both mother and newborn take nevirapine once _ the mother during
labor and the baby by the third day of life. The total cost is $4.
</P>
<P>
   Because AIDS prevention also requires testing and counseling,
which are scarce in the Third World, experts urged pilot studies of
such combinations before widespread use of nevirapine.
</P>
<P>
   The advance comes at a time when African leaders, mostly silent
for nearly two decades, have begun to speak out against AIDS.
Meanwhile, AIDS has become Africa's leading killer.

   Refugees Say Goodbye to an Army Post
</P>
<P>
   With the last refugees from Kosovo expected to leave in the
coming days, Fort Dix prepared to end its brief life as a gateway
for victims of ethnic cleansing, and go back to being a training
camp for military rservists.
</P>
<P>
   More than 4,000 Albanian Kosovars came through Fort Dix starting
in early May; immigration, health and police authorities used the
post to screen the newcomers before resettling them in 40 states.
Another 5,000 refugees, some with relatives already in the United
States, came in through Kennedy Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of the Kosovar refugees touched ordinary Americans,
who stepped forward in great numbers with donations and offers to
take in families, while communities vied to sponsor them, according
to resettlement workers. Though the United States pledged to take
in 20,000 Kosovars, the war's swift end has let it close down
resettlement efforts at less than half that number.

   Bush Forgoes Federal Funds to Avoid Spending Limit
</P>
<P>
   Politicians these days are raking in huge gobs of campaign cash,
more than ever before. So when a presidential candidate turns down
$16.5 million, there can only be one explanation: It's not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas announced he would not accept
federal money to finance his campaign for the Republican
nomination. That's because he wants to cut the strings attached to
the federal gift: restrictions on the amount he can spend.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates who accept federal money can't spend more than $40
million. But Bush has already collected $37 million _ seven months
shy of the first primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said avoiding spending limits would allow him to respond to
attacks by a wealthy Republican rival. That would seem to be Steve
Forbes, the multimillionaire publisher, who has already announced
he would not accept matching funds for the 2000 primary season.

<P>
   The Other Prime Minister's Visit
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the Israeli prime minister's visit to Washington
last week, everything went swimmingly.
</P>
<P>
   Of course. Foreign leaders don't just show up at the White
House; these visits are painstakingly planned so there are no
unpleasant surprises. Ever.
</P>
<P>
   Except where there are.
</P>
<P>
   Another prime minister also dropped in on President Clinton last
week and things didn't work out quite so well.
</P>
<P>
   He was John Howard of Australia and his notion was to score a
few points back home by celebrating the friendship between
Washington and Canberra.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Several days before he was due to arrive, the White House
announced that a 9 percent tariff would be slapped on Australian
lamb imports, and any imports above the current level would receive
an additional 40 percent tariff.
</P>
<P>
   There are few things closer to the Australian heart than a
roasted leg of lamb. More important, lamb is a major export, and
farmers remain a symbol of the Australian way of life. They are
also among the noisiest constituents an Australian politician can
face.
</P>
<P>
   So why did the president act just before the visit?
</P>
<P>
   Australian lamb, it turns out, has been doing so well on the
American market that sheep ranchers had begun to complain. More
than 30 senators, including Sen. Max S. Baucus, D-Mont., who
represents ranchers, wrote to the president asking him to decide in
favor of new tariffs. And he did.
</P>
<P>
   Howard, caught unawares, declared he was appalled and outraged.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian press was downright apoplectic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Damn Ewe!'' screamed The Daily Telegraph in Sydney. A
photograph of a sheep with Clinton's head superimposed accompanied
the article.
</P>
<P>
   Then the newspaper's New York correspondent was ordered to
Washington to find a live sheep. The reporter found a pet lamb and,
at his editor's request, tethered the animal to the White House
fence with a protest sign attached. The animal was duly
photographed.
</P>
<P>
   The next day at the White House, Howard's 20-minute audience
with Clinton was dominated not by discussion of friendship and new
defense arrangements, but by talk of meat.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Thinking Small. Real Small.
</P>
<P>
   As remarkable as today's supercomputers are, they may seem like
Model-T's in less than a decade. Scientists say they have taken the
first tentative steps into a world of computing that would be far
smaller and faster than today's silicon-based machines.
</P>
<P>
   By shrinking computer switches into the Lilliputian world of
individual molecules and atoms, researchers have raised the
possibility of building machines so small that they could navigate
human blood vessels hunting for diseases or create supercomputers
so powerful that they might be 100 billion times faster than
today's machines.
</P>
<P>
   A team of researchers from Hewlett Packard and the University of
California at Los Angeles reported in Science magazine that they
have succeeded in building tiny electronic switches no wider than a
single molecule.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said there is still much experimentation needed
to create complete computers from the tiny new switches.
</P>
<P>
   For example, they have yet to figure out how to hook the
switches together into vast arrays. And there are still skeptics
who believe that building machines from individual molecules will
always remain a science fiction tale.
</P>
<P>
   But the new molecular switches are a promising first step. If
nothing else, they suggest that if there are limits in the world of
microelectronics that may one day slow the advance in computing
power, they may not be reached for many decades.

   No Fishing
</P>
<P>
   Church and state, forever separate _ that's American bedrock. No
city would dare, say, depict Jesus on a town hall banner. But as
with any self-respecting issue, vast gray areas emerge. If two
lines cross in a town logo, some will see a Christian symbol;
others, well, two lines crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Republic, Mo., has a fish symbol in its official seal. Is this
fish just a fish? Apparently not. The seal's designer said the
symbol represented all religion. But some saw an ancient Christian
symbol and demanded its removal, prompting a bizarre legal battle.
Backers of the fish, even as they acknowledged its religious
overtones, tried to prove it predated Christianity. And local
manicurists painted fish on customers' nails _ presumably with
their permission.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the American Civil Liberties Union, representing a
local believer in witchcraft, won the day, as a federal judge ruled
that it was indeed a ``Christian fish'' and had to go.

<P>
   SUPERPOWER-REVIEW _ It is hard to pinpoint the moment when
America's successes in the 1990s moved from a subject of grudging
admiration in capitals around the world, to a source of annoyance
at Washington's triumphal-sounding pronouncements, to a cause of
real apprehension. But surely the capstone came with Kosovo.
Intentionally or not it demonstrated to allies and potential
adversaries alike how the Americans had exploited new military
technologies since the Gulf War. By David E. Sanger.

   ISRAEL-BARAK-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ Ehud Barak, the new prime
minister of Israel, is determined to be the great peacemaker of his

<P>
   IRAN-REVIEW (Tehran, Iran) _ Things are not always what they
seem in this country of high walls and black veils. Invasions,

   BOSNIA-REVIEW (Srebrenica, Bosnia-Herzegovina) _ Four years ago
this month, Bosnian Serb soldiers hunted down and killed as many as
7,000 mostly unarmed Muslim men in the rugged hills surrounding
Srebrenica, a town the United Nations declared a ``safe area'' and
vowed to protect. Since the war ended in 1995, local Serb
nationalists have used tactics ranging from endless negotiations to
rock-throwing mobs to prevent the town council from meeting. But in
a scene difficult to imagine only a few months ago, two dozen
Muslim politicians calmly sat down with 20 of their Serb
counterparts in the lobby of a local hotel on June 29 and held the
inaugural session of the town council of what they called the
``near Srebrenica.'' By David Rohde.

<P>
   EMBASSY-CLOSINGS-REVIEW (Washington) _ The closing of American
embassies, those flag-flying symbols of American power and
influence, was once about as common as a snowstorm on the
palm-shaded beaches of Madagascar. But in the year since terrorist
bombs destroyed American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, 67
American embassies and consulates have been closed for some period
of time for security reasons. By Philip Shenon.

</P>
<P>
   RECYCLED-TV-REVIEW _ These days, it's no longer a question of

question now is which ones don't. And the answer, increasingly, is
precious few. By Thomas Vinciguerra.
</P>
<P>
   (Story has moved in ``a'' news file.)

   PUNITIVE-DAMAGES-REVIEW _ Sending messages is the purpose of
punitive damages, defined by law as punishment for especially
outrageous conduct. But do juries go too far? By William Glaberson.

<P>
   (Story has moved in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   AIRLINE-SAFETY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Pleas for justice are
routine after an airplane crash, and they are generally played out
in civil courts, where survivors and relatives of victims sue for
damages. But last week, in a surprising move, prosecutors won
criminal indictments against a maintenance company, two mechanics
and a superior in the crash of a Valujet plane in the Everglades in
1996. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   (Story has moved in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH-CARE-REVIEW (Washington) _ After listening to the
rancorous debate in the Senate over health-care reform last week,
it would seem obvious that differences between Democrats and
Republicans are profound. But removed from the context of
election-year politics, combatants on both sides make it clear
there is plenty of room to compromise on a way to give Americans
some protection from health-care plans that wrongly skimp on
coverage. By Michael Weinstein.

<P>
   RELIGION-BILLBOARDS-REVIEW _ Whether it rains or freezes, and
even if you don't have a plastic Jesus on the dashboard of your
car, you might have a hard time avoiding reminders of the Lord on
highways across the country this summer. Since last fall,
billboards and signs bearing specific messages have appeared on
roads in some 40 states from Alaska to Texas. But not everyone's
ecstatic. By Tom Kuntz.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, July 18, have moved in the `a' or `i' category codes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SUPERPOWER-REVIEW _ It is hard to pinpoint the moment when
America's successes in the 1990s moved from a subject of grudging
admiration in capitals around the world, to a source of annoyance
at Washington's triumphal-sounding pronouncements, to a cause of
real apprehension. But surely the capstone came with Kosovo.
Intentionally or not it demonstrated to allies and potential
adversaries alike how the Americans had exploited new military
technologies since the Gulf War. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   (Story has moved in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-BARAK-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ Ehud Barak, the new prime
minister of Israel, is determined to be the great peacemaker of his
country's history, to resolve century-old conflicts once and for
all. But the former general does not spout a vision that could even
remotely be considered utopian. By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   (Story has moved in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-REVIEW (Tehran, Iran) _ Things are not always what they
seem in this country of high walls and black veils. Invasions,
occupations, foreign meddling and arbitrary rule over the centuries
have scarred the collective memory of the Iranian people and taught
them keys to survival: improvisation, role-playing and even
deception. By Elaine Sciolino.
</P>
<P>
   (Story has moved in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   TAIWAN-CHINA-REVIEW (Beijing) _ Here's a riddle: How do you make
a country richer and more democratic and at the same time
outmaneuver a huge, luggish neighbor that wants to ``reunify'' with
you? Here's an answer (and Beijing won't like this): ask the
president of Taiwan, Lee Teng-hui. By Seth Faison.
</P>
<P>
   (Story has moved in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   BOSNIA-REVIEW (Srebrenica, Bosnia-Herzegovina) _ Four years ago
this month, Bosnian Serb soldiers hunted down and killed as many as
7,000 mostly unarmed Muslim men in the rugged hills surrounding
Srebrenica, a town the United Nations declared a ``safe area'' and
vowed to protect. Since the war ended in 1995, local Serb
nationalists have used tactics ranging from endless negotiations to
rock-throwing mobs to prevent the town council from meeting. But in
a scene difficult to imagine only a few months ago, two dozen
Muslim politicians calmly sat down with 20 of their Serb
counterparts in the lobby of a local hotel on June 29 and held the
inaugural session of the town council of what they called the
``near Srebrenica.'' By David Rohde.
</P>
<P>
   (Story has moved in ``i' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   EMBASSY-CLOSINGS-REVIEW (Washington) _ The closing of American
embassies, those flag-flying symbols of American power and
influence, was once about as common as a snowstorm on the
palm-shaded beaches of Madagascar. But in the year since terrorist
bombs destroyed American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, 67
American embassies and consulates have been closed for some period
of time for security reasons. By Philip Shenon.
</P>
<P>
   (Story has moved in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   RECYCLED-TV-REVIEW _ These days, it's no longer a question of
which television shows, no matter how crummy, become movies. The
question now is which ones don't. And the answer, increasingly, is
precious few. By Thomas Vinciguerra.
</P>
<P>
   (Story has moved in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   PUNITIVE-DAMAGES-REVIEW _ Sending messages is the purpose of
punitive damages, defined by law as punishment for especially
outrageous conduct. But do juries go too far? By William Glaberson.
</P>
<P>
   (Story has moved in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   AIRLINE-SAFETY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Pleas for justice are
routine after an airplane crash, and they are generally played out
in civil courts, where survivors and relatives of victims sue for
damages. But last week, in a surprising move, prosecutors won
criminal indictments against a maintenance company, two mechanics
and a superior in the crash of a Valujet plane in the Everglades in
1996. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   (Story has moved in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH-CARE-REVIEW (Washington) _ After listening to the
rancorous debate in the Senate over health-care reform last week,
it would seem obvious that differences between Democrats and
Republicans are profound. But removed from the context of
election-year politics, combatants on both sides make it clear
there is plenty of room to compromise on a way to give Americans
some protection from health-care plans that wrongly skimp on
coverage. By Michael Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   (Story has moved in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-BILLBOARDS-REVIEW _ Whether it rains or freezes, and
even if you don't have a plastic Jesus on the dashboard of your
car, you might have a hard time avoiding reminders of the Lord on
highways across the country this summer. Since last fall,
billboards and signs bearing specific messages have appeared on
roads in some 40 states from Alaska to Texas. But not everyone's
ecstatic. By Tom Kuntz.

<P>
   Are you fed up with ``Eyes Wide Shut'' yet? Can you stand any
more of those slightly-out-of-focus stills of Tom and Nicole
snogging in front of a mirror with that effortful,
for-God's-sake-no-tongues-we're-married air of qualified passion?
</P>
<P>
   Can you read any more outpourings from ex-friends of the late
Stanley Kubrick, about what a cold, heartless creep he was, what a
chilly visionary with his mad eyes and exiguous beard, how
heartlessly he used people with the endlessly deferred promise of
cinematic glory (``I have the whore's consolations: whatever I am,
he chose me; he chose me; he chose me. How many reasons is that to
be happy?'' asks Frederic Raphael, the screenwriter).
</P>
<P>
   How much longer can you wait to find out the movie's Big Secret.
Do Cruise and Kidman actually have it off on-screen? (An old
chestnut in the history of movie speculation _ we wondered the same
thing about Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie in ``Don't Look
Now,'' about John Lone and Jane March in ``The Lover,'' about Jack
Nicholson and Jessica Lange in ``The Postman Always Rings Twice.'')
</P>
<P>
   Is the film an inspection of the wildest shores of human
sexuality? Does Tom Cruise really swan around in a Vivienne
Westwood frock? Is it the first intellectual blue movie? What's all
this stuff about the masked-orgy scene?
</P>
<P>
   I suspect we're all a little weary of being tantalized, teased
and trailered, subjected to the protracted foreplay of hints and
half-reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Brothers, which produced the movie, has refused to let
critics see previews except for a favored handful like the guys at
Time magazine, who were then sworn to secrecy about the content,
while publishing a four-page cover story about everything except
What Happens in it.
</P>
<P>
   Oh for God's sake. You want to know the plot? Right then...
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes Wide Shut'' is a comedy thriller with science-fiction
overtones in which Dr. William Hartman (Cruise), a former physician
turned tightrope-walker in a travelling circus, who, while
performing in a Wyoming backwoods town, falls in love with Alice
(Kidman), the local barfly, after watching her regale the company
with Janis Joplin numbers at Krazy Kath's Karaoke Bar.
</P>
<P>
   They emigrate to England, set up home in Wandsworth, and have a
baby which is stolen by aliens from the planet Encripticon II.
</P>
<P>
   Their attempts to retrieve the infant are thwarted by shady
Detective Chief Inspector McTaggart (Billy Connolly) so they enlist
the help of a hilariously inept gumshoe called Sid (Danny De Vito,
cast against type) who, with his on-off girlfriend Norma (Catherine
Zeta Jones), discovers the existence of a sect of orgiastic Dorothy
Squires fans led by Obi-Wan Sinatra (Pete Postlethwaite) bent on
ridding the planet of mobile telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Alice gets her kit off, Hartman spends a lot of time brooding in
front of a black monolith, the baby mutates into a galactic sheep
and the film ends with a shoot-out in the Millennium Dome.
</P>
<P>
   That's what I call a plot. And remember: you read it here
first. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   YEKATERINBURG, Russia _ Set on the Ural mountain divide between
Europe and Asia, this city has long been at the crossroads of
Russian history.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's last czar was executed in Yekaterinburg. President
Boris Yeltsin began his political career here as a Communist Party
boss. And the local military still boasts of its Cold War role in
shooting down Gary Powers' U-2 spy plane.
</P>
<P>
   But Yekaterinburg is best known these days for the protest that
has rocked the nation's most trusted institution: the Russian
Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   Yekaterinburg's powerful bishop has been accused by local
priests of rampant corruption, book burning and sexual impropriety.
The bitter duel among the clergy has begun to resemble the rough
and tumble of Russian politics.
</P>
<P>
   Dissident monks have been evicted from their monasteries.
CD-ROMs containing ``kompromat,'' or compromising testimony, have
been distributed to the scandal-hungry news media. Protesters have
marched to the stately residence of the bishop to demand his
removal.
</P>
<P>
   The revolt in Yekaterinburg, the church's third most important
diocese, has not only been a feast for the nation's tabloid press.
It is also presenting a major challenge to Russian Orthodox leaders
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Short of priests, strapped for money and facing an
overwhelmingly secular society, the church is already involved in a
difficult struggle to establish itself as a moral voice in
post-communist Russia and attract a new generation of believers.
</P>
<P>
   Its cautious response to the scandal has fortified criticism
that the church _ still haunted by ancient schisms _ is more
preoccupied with avoiding splits in its upper ranks than in rooting
out corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Church unity is an important thing, but I do not think such a
high price should be paid for this unity,'' said the Rev. Ilarion
Alfeyev, an Oxford-educated official of the patriarchate. ``It is
not just one or two priests who accuse the bishop. It is more than
50.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal position,'' he added, ``is that as long as the
evidence is clear, and it seems to be clear, the church has to make
a disciplinary decision. It is very important for the church to try
as hard as it can to purify itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Yekaterinburg scandal, the church faced enormous
obstacles in re-establishing itself.
</P>
<P>
   Russia still has its share of die-hard Communists who want
nothing to do with religion. And Russians who do believe in God now
have a multitude of religious movements and esoteric sects to
choose from.
</P>
<P>
   The church also spent 70 years surviving in the shadow of the
officially atheist Soviet government, which arrested and executed
many priests and set the boundaries within which those who survived
were supposed to operate. When the Soviet Union imploded, the
church found itself with an enormous amount to do and little to do
it with.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church has grown despite an extremely disruptive
situation,'' said the Rev. Leonid Kishkovsky, a leading priest of
the Orthodox Church in America who regularly consults with Russian
church leaders. ``Every element of what they need _ books, icons,
even clergy _ is in shortage. And yet they have managed.''
</P>
<P>
   But like other institutions trying to find their way in
post-Soviet Russia, there have been missteps.
</P>
<P>
   Financing has been a big worry. Thousands of churches and
monasteries that were confiscated by the Bolsheviks have been
returned, but they need millions of dollars in repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Since the overwhelming majority of Russian believers are poor
and there has been little direct government support, the church has
sometimes turned to questionable ways of raising revenue _ at
considerable cost to its reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Vsevolod Chaplin, the spokesman for the Moscow
patriarchate, acknowledged in an interview that the Russian
government had indirectly helped the church by allowing it to bring
tobacco and alcohol into the country tax-free. The goods were
designated as ``humanitarian aid.''
</P>
<P>
   The church turned the cigarettes and liquor over to private
companies, which sold them and shared their profits with the
church. Chaplin said the practice _ roundly criticized by the
Russian press _ has been stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The church's finances, however, are still secretive. Not even
church leaders in Moscow necessarily know what fund-raising
arrangements are being worked out in the church's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a centralized system,'' Chaplin explained.
``Every parish, every diocese can operate on its own initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of qualified priests has also hampered the church's
efforts to attract a new generation of believers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of perestroika, there were a little over
6,000 parishes across the entire Soviet Union, and now the church
has over 20,000,'' said Anatoly Krasikov, the director of a
Moscow-based institute on church-state relations and a former press
aide to Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the priests had to be trained quickly,'' Krasikov added.
``They know how to conduct the service but they often have no true
theological education. They often can't answer the questions of
believers, and many people who started to come to church quickly
became disenchanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, many Russians have turned away from the church after
an initial flurry of baptisms, church marriages and attendance at
religious services. Chaplin of the Moscow patriarchate estimates
that about 5 percent of Russians regularly attend church, though
some priests say even that may be an overestimate.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   The situation of the church in Yekaterinburg has not been any
easier.
</P>
<P>
   At the Rev. Vladimir Zyazyev's church in the Uralmash factory
district, several women came to light candles in front of the icons
and venerate the relics of Orthodox saints kept near the altar.
</P>
<P>
   Zyazyev said he planned a 24-hour telephone line for those who
have questions about the church or are seeking counsel. He
acknowledged that the Orthodox Church had much to do to reach out
to society.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one Orthodox church for every 80,000 people in
the city of Yekaterinburg,'' Zyazyev said. ``In the old days, there
was one church for every 1,000 people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is essential for us to have 500 new priests in our region
alone,'' he said. ``Then we could somehow speak of our influence.''
</P>
<P>
   But instead of expanding its appeal, Yekaterinburg's church has
been drawn into a web of intrigue since 1994, shortly after Bishop
Nikon took over the diocese.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Altai, a mountainous region near Kazakhstan, Nikon owed
his career to a powerful Soviet-style mentor.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man, he worked as a bookkeeper before finding a job
in a church candle shop in Irkutsk, Siberia. There he met
Metropolitan Mefody, a contentious figure who has been accused by
some churchmen of links to the KGB, or Soviet secret police.
</P>
<P>
   After being ordained into the church, the former bookkeeper
worked for the cleric for a decade. With the support of
Metropolitan Mefody, the Holy Synod appointed him bishop of the
Yekaterinburg region, an almost unheard-of promotion for a
clergyman of just 33.
</P>
<P>
   Yekaterinburg is not just another diocese. It includes the
ancient town of Verkhoturye, a 400-year-old pilgrimage site famous
for its cathedral and monastery. It is also the place where the
imperial family was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Duchess Elizabeth, a sister-in-law of Czar Nicholas II
famous for her piety, is the only Romanov to be canonized by the
church. A monastery named after the New Martyrs of Russia is being
built near the town of Alapayevsk, where she was thrown down a mine
shaft by the Bolsheviks.
</P>
<P>
   A church in Alapayevsk itself was one of those never shut down
by the Bolsheviks _ part of the uneasy accommodation between the
Orthodox Church and communist authority. On a recent feast day for
the Nativity of John the Baptist, a devout group of parishioners _
mostly elderly women and children, with a sprinkling of young men _
stood through a long liturgy, apparently oblivious to the political
storm over the administration of their diocese.
</P>
<P>
   While bishops have enormous leeway in administering their
dioceses, such important appointments have not always received a
lot of scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Roman Catholic Church it is not that easy to become a
bishop,'' said Alfeyev, the Moscow patriarchate official. ``There
is a special commission that selects people and follows their
personal development. But in our case there is no clear picture.
They might be under someone's protection. I don't think the Holy
Synod has enough time or means to actually investigate someone's
personal life and behavior in a very detailed way.''
</P>
<P>
   Nikon and his spokesman declined to be interviewed for this
article.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the bishop was seen as an energetic leader. Soon,
however, the diocese became a battleground.
</P>
<P>
   Local priests say that the bishop pressed their strapped
parishes to turn over icons, robes and silver chalices. They say he
demanded huge fees for resolving administrative matters. And they
complain that he ordered parishes to buy all of their church goods
from the diocese and then raised the prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were shocked that candles become so expensive,'' said
the Rev. Foma Abel, a priest in Nizhny Tagil, a grungy factory town
in the Yekaterinburg region. ``This really hurts the believers.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, the priests grumbled among themselves, but the
dispute heated up when the dissenters accused the bishop of
drunkenness and of openly practicing homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the diocese received some unflattering
publicity abroad after it was reported that Nikon had approved a
plan to confiscate books at a local seminary by two American
Orthodox theologians, the Rev. Alexander Schmemann and the Rev.
John Meyendorff, and by the Rev. Aleksandr Men, a liberal Russian
Orthodox priest who was axed to death in 1990. Some of the books
were even burned.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the priests decided to take their complaints to Moscow.
It was a fateful step, but not one that turned out the way the
protesters expected.
</P>
<P>
   In Soviet times, the church could not make any administrative
decisions without the approval of the state. But now that the Holy
Synod has the right to run its own affairs, it has often sought to
avoid open disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   After Father Tikhon, the abbot of a monastery in Verkhoturye,
and Father Avraam, the abbot of a monastery in Yekaterinburg, met
with the patriarch, the church dispatched a fact-finding commission
to Yekaterinburg in January.
</P>
<P>
   Headed by one of the patriarch's top aides, Metropolitan Sergei,
it found no grounds to remove the bishop, but the church did punish
the dissenters. When the dissenters continued their appeals, the
Holy Synod issued an order in April removing them from their
monasteries, some protesters say, for so persistently challenging
their bishop.
</P>
<P>
   In Soviet days, a decree from on high might have silenced the
debate. But the church authorities in Moscow seemed to misjudge the
depth of the opposition against the bishop and the willingness of
the priests to carry on their protest according to the rules of the
new, post-Soviet Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven parishes proclaimed they would not accept the bishop's
authority. The dissenters also took their case to the press, which
published salacious accounts of the bishop's alleged behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, it seemed, it was the Moscow patriarchate that was on
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to quiet the embarrassing dispute, Metropolitan Sergei
pressed the protesters to stop their media campaign and formally
repent for continuing with their appeals or risk losing their
position, some of the dissenters say.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated attempts, Metropolitan Sergei could not be
reached for comment. Chaplin, the spokesman for the patriarchate,
said the church was doing its best to untangle the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a group of priests that is accusing the bishop of all
the deadly sins,'' Chaplin said. ``On the other hand, there is some
evidence that these priests have a certain economic interest. So I
think the hierarchy will continue to study this situation. A bishop
is quite autonomous in his diocese.''
</P>
<P>
   Abel said, however, that the church appeared to be worried that
the removal of the bishop might invite similar protests elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are afraid of large-scale protests and think this could
be a precedent where there are also problems,'' he said. ``The
hierarchy thinks we have harmed the church more than all the Nikons
put together. So it is not just the problem of Nikon that must be
solved. It is also us.''

CLINTON WARNS AGAINST REPUBLICAN TAX CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (mk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stepping up his attack on Republican tax-cutting
proposals, President Clinton said Saturday that the cost of the tax
bill moving through the House would rise to ``unimaginable'' levels
and threaten the nation's ability to deal with its most pressing
long-term problems.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a new estimate by the Treasury Department that the cost
of the House tax bill would ``explode'' from $864 billion over the
first decade to $3 trillion in the 10-year period starting in 2010,
Clinton said the country could not afford to allocate anywhere near
that much money to tax cuts without first shoring up Social
Security and Medicare, both of which will come under severe
financial strain in the next few decades as the baby boom
generation retires and life expectancies increase.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan would also crimp the government's ability to
use projected federal budget surpluses to pay down the national
debt, and could eventually send the country back into a spiral of
budget deficits and rising debt reminiscent of the 1980s, Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the very time the nation will be confronting the
demographic challenge of the baby boom,'' Clinton said in his
weekly radio address, ``the Republican plan will blow a $3 trillion
hole in the federal budget, threatening our ability to secure
Social Security and Medicare for the next generation and risking
return to the era of deficits with high interest rates and economic
stagnation.''
</P>
<P>
   Tax cuts of the size contemplated by the Republicans, Clinton
said in his weekly national radio address, ``quite simply are bad
economic policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans defended their plan as prudent, and said Clinton was
straining to come up with a justification for why Washington should
not return to taxpayers the growing pile of excess federal revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats predicted dire consequences for the economy each time
taxes have been cut in the past few decades, most recently in 1997,
Republicans said. But each time, they said, the economy has been
strengthened, propelling the United States to new levels of
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an elaborate smoke screen to hide the fact that
Democrats don't want to cut taxes,'' said Trent Duffy, the
spokesman for Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who is chairman of the
Ways and Means Committee and the author of the House plan. ``All
their predictions about tax cuts have been wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer's $864 billion plan, which uses virtually all the surplus
over the next decade except for the portion that goes to Social
Security, was approved by the committee along party lines on
Wednesday, and is scheduled to go to the full House later this
month. In the Senate, the Finance Committee will take up a $792
billion 10-year tax cut on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton has threatened to veto both bills or any
blended version of them, he has signaled his willingness to
negotiate a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side, however, is quite ready to strike a deal.
Republicans are intent on passing their bills, even in the face of
a veto threat, to draw a clear distinction about their differences
with Clinton and his party as the 2000 election approaches.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton is happy to wait a few months, because
White House officials believe Republicans are stumbling into a
budget trap of their own making that will weaken their negotiating
position.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Republicans will be unable to pass
all the necessary appropriations bills this year without violating
strict spending caps that both parties have pledged to honor.
</P>
<P>
   Only after the Republicans' budget bind becomes clear _ probably
around or just after the end of the government's fiscal year on
Sept. 30 _ is Clinton likely to judge the time right for serious
talks on tax and spending issues, Democrats said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, as Clinton's statements Saturday suggest, both
parties are staking out positions and testing out new arguments to
keep the pressure on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Congress limits its long-term tax and spending projections to 10
years, judging that to be the longest horizon over which economists
and budget analysts can make halfway credible estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about the long-term cost of the current House Republican
proposal has been particularly acute among Democrats because of the
way the plan works. Rather than putting the entire package of tax
cuts into effect immediately, the plan phases them in gradually
over the next 10 years to match the expected growth of the budget
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it is not until the cuts are are fully phased in,
in 2009, that their full cost in foregone revenues is realized. For
the House plan, the cuts start out at $4.6 billion next year and
reach $203.4 billion in 2009.
</P>
<P>
   While clearly somewhat speculative if not outright guesswork
given the long-time horizon, the Treasury study cited by Clinton on
Saturday tries to project the costs starting in 2009, and to look
in particular at some of the provisions whose costs could be
expected to continue increasing at the fastest pace.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is the proposed repeal of the inheritance tax on
large estates. The lost revenue would be just $3 million next year,
growing to $15.2 billion by 2009, according to Congress' Joint
Committee on Taxation, for a total of $75.3 billion over the first
decade.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the Treasury estimates, the cost in 2009 would
be considerably higher _ $46 billion _ and would grow to an average
of $57 billion a year for the following decade, benefiting just a
tiny handful of wealthy taxpayers and their heirs, said Gene
Sperling, the White House economic adviser.

   The central feature of the House tax plan, its 10 percent
reduction in all income tax rates, would likewise show a steep cost
increase, Sperling said, growing from just over $400 billion in the
first decade to $1.5 trillion in the second 10 years.

   ``The reason why this is such a threat to our long-term fiscal
health and our ability to preserve Medicare and Social Security is
that this is exactly the period _ between 2010 and 2020 _ when
Medicare becomes insolvent, when Social Security first comes under
strain, and when we first see the challenges of the baby-boom
retirement,'' Sperling said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A small plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife,
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister was reported missing on
Friday, and a huge search was under way Saturday off Long Island,
N.Y., and Cape Cod, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was flying to the wedding of a cousin, Rory, daughter of
the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, in Hyannisport, Mass. She was to
be married Saturday before 275 guests in a private ceremony. The
wedding was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Martha LaGuardia, a Coast Guard spokeswoman, said the plane,
a Piper 32 Saratoga, left from Fairfield, N.J., at 8:38 p.m. on
Friday and was scheduled to land on Martha's Vineyard, Mass., about
10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Coast Guard, the last contact between the plane
and aviation authorities was at 9:39 p.m. on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   When the plane did not arrive, the Kennedy family notified the
Federal Aviation Administration, which began trying to track the
plane, a staff member for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. LaGuardia said she did not know who was piloting the plane.
Some news reports said Kennedy, who obtained his pilot's license
last year, was at the controls. Other reports said a flight
instructor was on board.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kennedy compound in Hyannisport, a white tent stood by
the sea, and a flag at full staff billowed in the breeze. A Mass
began on the porch of the house of Rory's mother, Ethel Kennedy,
with about 50 family members and three priests praying ``for the
safety of the loved ones, as well as for Rory'' and her fiance,
Mark Bailey, said a family spokesman, Brian O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Rivers of Hyannis was to dress the hair of the bridal
party before attending the wedding as a guest. Friday night, she
designed Rory's hair for the rehearsal dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just wonderful over there last night, just exciting,''
Ms. Rivers said as she sat by her telephone Saturday. ``It's just
not fair. I don't know what it is, but it's not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the compound were the bride; her uncle, Edward M.
Kennedy; her mother, Ethel Kennedy, and numerous friends and
members of the wedding party.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 38, is the only surviving son of John F. Kennedy, the
35th president. He was born within weeks of his father's 1960
election and was known to the nation as ``John-John,'' a childhood
nickname.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 22, 1963, his father was assassinated, and the enduring
image from the funeral came when Kennedy, then a little boy in a
blue coat and shorts, saluted his father's casket outside St.
Matthew's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   It was his third birthday.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was informed early Saturday, and the White
House said search efforts were being coordinated by the Coast
Guard, the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Department of
Defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force Rescue Coordination Center out of Langley Air
Force Base was leading the search, with help from Coast Guard
vessels dispatched from Cape Cod and Montauk, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The search was being conducted along the presumed flight path of
Kennedy's plane.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard said that in addition to a number of vessels, it
had launched an H-60, or Jayhawk, helicopter, a Falcon fixed-wing
jet, and a C-130 from the Air National Guard. They were searching
Block Island Sound, Long Island Sound, and the South Shore of Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've set up search areas that would cover any possible area
the plane would have flown over,'' Ms. LaGuardia said. ``We would
hope that if there was a distress signal we would be able to pick
up on it.'' But, she said, ``I have not been able to confirm any
kind of signal.'' Other agencies joined the search.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have three marine boats searching the North Shore area,
from Huntington out east,'' said Officer Robert Harris of the
Suffolk County (N.Y.) Police Department. ``It's an Air Force and
Coast Guard search. We are assisting as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board, Ted
Lopatkiewicz, said his agency, which investigates all plane
crashes, was standing by. ``We wouldn't know where to go at this
stage,'' he said. The Safety Board got the report of an overdue
plane at about 5 a.m., he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board early Saturday morning
sent investigators to the airport in Caldwell to gather records and
speak to ground personnel, according to a person answering the
phone at the airport operations center. The Safety Board's regional
office is nearby, in Parsippany, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft such as the Piper do not carry flight data recorders or
cockpit voice recorders, the ``black boxes'' that investigators use
to piece together the details of airliner crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was flying under visual flight rules, meaning that the
pilot took responsibility for picking his route and avoiding other
traffic, rather than relying on air traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the FAA's air traffic control system did not assign it a
specific beacon code; it would have showed up on controllers' radar
screens with a generic symbol denoting general aviation.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators could pick it out, though, if they knew its hour
of departure and general route. That might help locate the wreckage
and could give a clue as to whether the plane broke up in flight,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Though wind conditions were mild on Friday night, visibility in
the area was poor, pilots said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very hazy, and it was very dark, and it was very hard
to see the horizon,'' said Michael C. Bard, a private pilot, who
left Martha's Vineyard about 9:15 p.m. on Friday and flew back to
his home in Danbury, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not instrument rated, it could be difficult
maintaining the airplane in an upright condition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe that something like this could happen _ again
_ to the Kennedy family,'' said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York,
speaking at the city's Office of Emergency Management on the 23rd
floor of the World Trade Center. ``Let's hope and pray that it's a
successful effort,'' he said of the search.
</P>
<P>
   New York Police Commissioner Howard Safir said the Police
Department, acting on a request from the Kennedy family early
Saturday, had dispatched officers to Kennedy's Manhattan apartment
to make sure he was not there.
</P>
<P>
   The family also asked the police to make sure Kennedy's car was
at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Brown University, Kennedy went to law
school and joined the Manhattan district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 he started the magazine George _ subtitled ``not just
politics as usual.'' A year later, Kennedy _ once dubbed ``the
sexiest man alive'' by People magazine _ married Ms. Bessette.

SWISS FREEZE ASSETS OF MILOSEVIC ASSOCIATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Swiss authorities said last week that they would freeze
the assets of 300 people close to Slobodan Milosevic as part of the
most intensive effort yet by Western countries to squeeze the
Yugoslav leader.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Switzerland blocked funds belonging to Milosevic and
four high-ranking allies who were indicted along with him by the
international war crimes tribunal in The Hague in May.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, Swiss authorities have turned up no assets
in their names, said a federal police office spokesman, Folco
Galli. Federal officials believe that any funds here may have been
transferred elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In extending their freeze, Swiss officials were acting in
response to a list provided by the European Union, which had asked
other countries to search for money in the names of hundreds of
individuals and companies connected with the country's ruling
elite.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss order, signed into effect on Friday by President Ruth
Dreifuss, means that any accounts in the names of the individuals
or companies listed must be frozen, and immediately reported to
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss banks or financial firms also may not accept or manage
funds for those named on the 15-member European Union list.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to comply can result in criminal penalties or fines, but
the reporting system relies on voluntary compliance, Swiss
officials concede.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Swiss government froze assets belonging to
Milosevic and his associates at the request of the war crimes
tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal made the request in May after the indictment of
five men, including Milosevic, for atrocities allegedly committed
by Serbian forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The others indicted are Milan Milutinovic, the president of
Serbia; Nikola Sainovic, the Yugoslav deputy prime minister;
Dragoljub Ojdanic, chief of the Yugoslav armed forces, and Vlajko
Stojiljkovic, Serbia's interior minister.

<P>
   MOKHRA, India _ The crowd heaved and moaned and pushed up
against the plain wooden box that held the body of Suresh Kumar, an
Indian soldier killed in the fighting with Pakistan over Kashmir.
But as the lid was pried open, the throng parted easily to let
television cameramen in for a close-up of the young man's mother.
Her eyes brimmed with tears as she gave her son's face a final
caress.
</P>
<P>
   The people of this north Indian town, population 35,000, have
vicariously experienced India's small undeclared war over Kashmir
by watching television and they wanted to share their part in the
drama with the rest of the nation, even as the fighting draws to a
close.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got the news of his martyrdom, we felt lonely,'' said
Balwan Singh Malik, a 40-year-old farmer. ``But when people came to
this village from the outside world, we didn't feel lonely
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   India has fought three larger wars with Pakistan, in 1947, 1965
and 1971, but the last two months of fighting in the Himalayan land
of Kashmir that lies between them has produced India's first
televised war. In 1971, fewer than 1 in 200 of India's households
had TVs. Now, it's more than 1 in 3.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Mokhra, people huddled around their radios to follow
India's victory in the 1971 war, which led to the dismemberment of
Pakistan and the creation of Bangladesh. Only a few families had
televisions. While telephones are still a rarity here and cars
rarer still, most people now either have a television set
themselves or a friend or relative who does.
</P>
<P>
   Much as the railroads of the British colonial era helped knit
together this polyglot, multilingual subcontinent into a nation, so
television has rallied people from all over this vast country
behind the war effort, including the multitudes who cannot read a
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Some social critics have celebrated this renewed sense of unity
in a country so often beset by fissures of caste, region and
language. But others fear the consequences of a nationalism that is
so built on mistrust of Pakistan _ and contrast it to the
nationalism of India's founders, who aspired to ideals of
nonviolence and brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``What worries me is that security vis-a-vis Pakistan may become
the top item on our policy agenda,'' said Yogendra Yadav, a
political scientist at the Center for the Study of Developing
Societies, based in New Delhi. ``That's very sad for a country like
India. We have a lot of other things to handle _ hunger, poverty,
clean drinking water.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether for good or ill, this war _ fought on Indian soil and at
a cost of hundreds of soldiers' lives _ has stirred public passions
in India, much more than in Pakistan. The conflict goes back to the
partition of India and Pakistan when they gained independence from
Britain in 1947. Kashmir, which has a Muslim majority, was made
part of predominantly Hindu India rather than Islamic Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   While India has clearly identified Pakistan as the aggressor in
the recent fighting, Pakistani officials have continued to insist _
despite widespread disbelief among experts and Western diplomats _
that the men fighting the Indians are not Pakistani soldiers and
Pakistan-backed militants, but Kashmiri freedom fighters.
Pakistan's official account has distanced people there from the
conflict. And the government's refusal to accept bodies that India
says are Pakistani soldiers has meant there have been many fewer
emotionally fraught funerals in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   In India, the signs of an aroused public are everywhere. Blood
donations to the Indian Red Cross Society in New Delhi have
tripled. School children have collected money and movie stars have
given benefits for soldiers' welfare funds.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago India pulled out of a cricket series it plays
every year with Pakistan in Toronto. Just four months earlier,
India was the host to Pakistan for a series in which an Indian
audience gave a standing ovation to a victorious Pakistani team.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Mokhra, the war is universally seen as a completely
justified reaction to the enemy's infiltration and occupation of
Indian territory in Kashmir, especially coming as it did less than
three months after India had reached out its hand in friendship to
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict has saturated television screens here and across
India with searing images of battle and death, of valor and
sacrifice _ and helped harden public sentiment against Pakistan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The sense of betrayal is bracketed by two sets of images. The
first is from Feb. 20. Karan Singh, a 58-year-old farmer, recalled
what he saw live on television and said it was ``still fresh in my
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   On that day, India's grandfatherly looking prime minister, Atal
Behari Vajpayee, 72, rode a bus to Pakistan on a peacemaking
mission, and when he crossed the Indian border into Pakistan, he
awkwardly embraced Pakistan's prime minister, Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went to build a harmonious relationship with Pakistan,''
Singh said. ``They agreed that nobody would cross into each other's
territory. Pakistan betrayed us.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the bus as a symbol of hope between these neighbors, both
burdened by common problems of poverty and illiteracy, has been
replaced by the unforgettable imagery of war.
</P>
<P>
   Rajesh Malik, a teacher, recalls the awe he felt as he watched
India's giant guns firing shells that soared through the sky in
great fiery arcs to land on peaks. Singh recounted the pride he
felt when soldiers stuck India's tricolored flag into a towering
peak they had recaptured from fighters. And Balwan Singh Malik, the
farmer, said he would always remember the ceremonies honoring the
dead as their bodies were carried home to every corner of India.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Kumar, the first soldier from Mokhra to be killed
in a war since India gained independence, bestowed great honor on
his hometown and his family, residents say. Like a majority of
Mokhra's residents, he was a Jat, a member of an upwardly mobile
peasant caste with a long martial tradition. Most every Jat family
here has at least one member in the military or the police.
</P>
<P>
   While he was posted on duty last week in Kashmir, Kumar was
killed instantly when struck in the ear by shrapnel. On Monday,
military officers from New Delhi arrived at his parents' door. In
less than 24 hours, the news had spread far and wide. A local radio
station and newspaper announced it, and word of mouth carried it
farther.
</P>
<P>
   His hometown set aside space for a memorial and gave his family
four acres of land. Shops and schools in the area were closed on
Tuesday, the day of the cremation.
</P>
<P>
   By dawn, thousands of people who had never met Kumar began to
gather along the roadside into his hometown. They stood or squatted
on their haunches, silent and solemn in the dust and heat, waiting
patiently by the hour for the army truck carrying his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our brothers died, so we should pay our respects to
him,'' said Ram Kishan, a nearly toothless farmer from the
neighboring town of Madina. Kishan practically spit when the
subject of Pakistan came up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are common people,'' he said. ``But if they come here we
will chop them up. We can even go there to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The rutted dirt roads of Mokhra _ normally deserted in the
pitiless midday heat _ were filled with sweating throngs of people.
At Kumar's home, hundreds of people crowded into the courtyard and
perched on the walls that enclosed it. Men smoking hookahs sat on
one side and veiled women commiserated with one another on the
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the son of the country's, not of mine,'' said his
mother, Bhagwani. But her disheveled appearance, trembling voice
and the low moans that escaped unbidden from her throat belied her
brave words. The face of Kumar's wife, Sulekha Devi, 28 and eight
months pregnant, was a stern mask. ``I have no regrets,'' she said
repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   As the convoy of jeeps and trucks that accompanied Kumar's body
inched along the road to his home, schoolchildren of 6 and 7,
dressed in green gingham uniforms, shouted ardently in unison:
``Who will defend the nation? We will!''
</P>
<P>
   Cameramen posted on the wall of the courtyard captured Kumar's
sad homecoming in all its pageantry and chaos, as the crowd in the
courtyard surged forward. The cameramen moved in on the pine box as
it was opened, and followed it to the cremation grounds. There,
they positioned themselves at the head of the funeral pyre, as
aspiring politicians clustered nearby, so close the cameras could
not miss them.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 people packed the grounds. They were piled on
the tops of buses, on the roofs of buildings, in the backs of
flatbed trucks and on the hoods of tractors. They lined every
available wall. And chants rose up spontaneously from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long live Suresh Kumar!'' they shouted. ``Death to Pakistan!''
</P>
<P>
   For a town where the plodding gait of an ox cart and the slow
rumble of a tractor set the pace, this was a moment lifted from the
ordinary, a moment of grandeur and rage and public catharsis.
</P>
<P>
   When Kumar's mother walked onto the raised ground where the pyre
was situated, the crowd burst into applause and they clapped again
when more than a dozen soldiers lifted rifles to their shoulders
and fired a salute.
</P>
<P>
   After a parade of family members and honored guests offered
garlands and sprinkled the pyre with marigold petals, Kumar's body
was covered with herbs and his face smeared with ghee, a clarified
butter that is auspicious and speeds the fire. Thick gnarled tree
limbs and sprays of kindling were piled on top of him.
</P>
<P>
   Kumar had no son to light his pyre, so his father, Mir Singh, a
wizened old farmer in a white turban, put flaming straw to it and
watched as it went up in a whoosh of ravenous fire.
</P>
<P>
   That evening, people all over Mokhra clustered around their
televisions for the nightly national news on Doordarshan, the
state-run television station, and found themselves featured in a
tribute to what the announcer solemnly called ``the martyred
soldiers who died fighting the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, this small farming town in the state of Haryana
had become part of the nation's history. The dead soldier's father
said, ``They made sure his martyrdom will be remembered and
recorded.''

SOUTH AFRICA HEARING UGLY TALE IN RIVETING DETAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRETORIA, South Africa _ In his drab denim shirts and army-style
green sweaters, Eugene de Kock answers questions for hours, rarely
showing any signs of emotion. His face is lineless, his eyes small
behind thick glasses that make him look more like the class nerd
than South Africa's most notorious apartheid-era henchman.
</P>
<P>
   De Kock's amnesty application, listing his misdeeds, is more
than 4,000 pages long. It is by far the largest one received by
this country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Already he has
been on the stand more than six weeks. Getting through his
application is expected to take 16 weeks. No one else comes close.
</P>
<P>
   The other day he was describing the killing of Japie Maponya, a
small town security guard, who had done nothing at all except that
his brother was an antiapartheid guerrilla. First, Maponya was
tortured (he divulged nothing), then taken to a forest to be
killed.
</P>
<P>
   There is some dispute, however, about what followed. For no
apparent reason, one of the security officers with de Kock slammed
Maponya on the side of the head with the silencer-equipped gun that
was to be used in Maponya's execution. This caused the gun to jam,
and another gun had to be used.
</P>
<P>
   But the question occupying the commission was did de Kock smash
a shovel through Maponya's skull before or after he was finally
shot?
</P>
<P>
   De Kock insisted it was after. ``It was standard practice to
make sure people were dead after they had been shot,'' said de
Kock, who has a way of making brutality sound like regulation.
</P>
<P>
   But others who were there say differently. They say that when
the gun jammed, de Kock did not hesitate to pick up the shovel and
hit the kneeling, handcuffed Maponya with the sharp edge. Only
afterward, they say, because he still showed signs of life, was
Maponya shot in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Inside an ordinary conference room here the grisly details of
the more than 100 instances of torture and killings to which de
Kock has confessed are gone over and over again _ illustrating
perhaps more than any other testimony the ugliness of the former
government's efforts to stay in power.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite de Kock's voluminous confessions many people believe
that he has still not told the whole truth, that he is holding back
details, trying to make himself look more like a soldier than a
monster.
</P>
<P>
   To get amnesty, the commission, which is investigating human
rights abuses during the apartheid-era, must find that de Kock has
told the whole truth and that his acts were politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still discrepancies,'' said Linda Lockhat, who was
questioning de Kock for the Commission last week. ``He still does
not want to admit some things. He wants to clean it up, to make it
look like he was a precision man, an army man in a war.''
</P>
<P>
   De Kock, a highly decorated former colonel in South Africa's
police force, was in charge of the Vlakplaas counterterrorism unit
from 1985 to 1993. But he is currently in jail serving two life
terms plus 212 years for a range of charges, including six murders,
one attempted murder and 66 acts of fraud. He has written a book on
his life, lashing out at the generals who he says abandoned him
after he had finished their dirty work.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether he will be granted amnesty and for which
acts.
</P>
<P>
   The Truth Commission, which is supposed to help South Africa put
its apartheid past to rest, issued 3,500 pages of its final report
last fall and is winding down its work, with only about 800 of its
6,400 amnesty applications still pending.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has already granted amnesty in some of South
Africa's most memorable cases of human rights violations, like the
killing of Amy Biehl, an American aid worker who was stoned to
death in a township outside of Cape Town because she was white.

<P>
   But in recent months the commission has also denied amnesty in
several prominent cases, including those involved in the deaths of
the activist Chris Hani and the leader of the Black Consciousness
movement, Steve Biko.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that the range of de Kock's offenses is so large it
is unlikely he will get out of jail anytime soon. Some of his acts
_ killing a diamond dealer because he was not satisfied with the
quality of the diamonds he was sold _ appear to have little to do
with politics.
</P>
<P>
   De Kock himself routinely acknowledges that his misdeeds are so
many that he has trouble remembering them himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent 10 years as the head of an incredibly active unit,''
de Kock told the commission just last week when he was being
questioned about who had witnessed Maponya's murder. ``It is
difficult to keep track of every detail.''

IRANIAN STUDENTS SUSPEND PROTESTS BUT PRESS DEMANDS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Student leaders Saturday announced a temporary
ban on pro-reform demonstrations, but pressed the Islamic
government on a long list of demands, including the resignation of
the country's chief of police.
</P>
<P>
   The decision of student leaders to call off their protests, at
least for the moment, buys time for the country's clerical
leadership in the face of the worst unrest since the early days of
Iran's revolution two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   A communique, faxed to news organizations by the student
leaders, who have called themselves the Select Council of Sit-In
Students, was politely worded and included no threats or ultimatums
if their demands were not met. But it nonetheless put the
government in an awkward position.
</P>
<P>
   The communique asked for meetings with Iran's top leaders,
including Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country's supreme leader, as
well as President Mohammad Khatami and former President Ali Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani, who still wields considerable power as the head
of an important overseeing body.
</P>
<P>
   The student leaders will decide whether to resume their public
protest after those meetings, the communique said. Letters
requesting meetings were delivered to each of the officials on
Friday. A student spokesman said it was important for student
leaders to explain their demands to the country's clerical
leadership in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``The council will put off a decision to hold any demonstration,
gathering or sit-in for the future,'' the four-page statement said.
``So it begs our students and our mature people not to join any
demonstration, gathering or sit-in that could be manipulated by
anarchists and people who favor violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The students' communique, their third since they organized early
last week, also claimed that 1,400 students and other people had
been arrested since the unrest began more than a week ago. The
group demanded that the authorities release the arrested people and
make their identities public.
</P>
<P>
   Although the initial sit-ins and demonstrations were organized
by students, there is universal agreement that their ranks were
infiltrated by nonstudents, perhaps members of the People's
Mujahedeen, the country's main opposition group, or even
pro-government vigilantes. The government has condemned the
demonstrators as saboteurs committed to destroying the stability of
the country, and it will be difficult for it to make concessions.

   REBOLEDO, Uruguay _ From Monday through Wednesday, Tabare
Vazquez fights cancer as one of Uruguay's leading oncologists. From
Thursday through Saturday, he runs for president _ and along the
campaign trail he wags his finger at smokers, urging them to ``lay
off the poison.''
</P>
<P>
   For Vazquez, the 57-year-old former mayor of the capital,
Montevideo, campaigning is like making a house call. As wintry
winds blow off the pampas, he walks up and down streets of small
towns telling people to button up or go to bed to nurse a sniffle.
</P>
<P>
   All of this soft nurturing comes from the man who leads a
coalition of former Tupamaro guerrillas, communists, socialists and
Trotskyites.
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders of Uruguay's two traditional centrist parties,
including President Julio Maria Sanguinetti, say Vazquez is really
a Marxist wolf in disguise who would destroy the Uruguayan economy.
The local news media badger him on statements applauding the social
advances of the Cuban revolution and comparing the free-market
economic policies sweeping Latin America to ``a cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   But after Vazquez easily won an April primary, polls indicate
that he stands head to head with Jorge Batlle of the center-left
Colorado Party with three months remaining before a first-round
vote. Former President Luis Alberto Lacalle of the center-right
Blanco Party is falling well behind, and Vazquez and Batlle are
already making plans for winning over his supporters in a likely
November runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Expecting to win handily in Montevideo, where unions are strong
and the government is the leading employer, Vazquez is
concentrating on the countryside, trying to win the traditional
stronghold of the Blanco Party, where the left is viewed with
strong suspicion. Vazquez is offering farmers tax cuts, a
moratorium on foreclosures and higher tariffs to protect their
markets from cheap Brazilian produce.
</P>
<P>
   While his campaign caravan drove through the dairy town of
Reboledo, Vazquez waved and threw kisses through the window.
``Places like this were inaccessible to us until just a few years
ago,'' he said. ``If we had come here during the 1971 campaign,
they might have thrown rocks at us, or even fired guns.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the violence of that campaign, as well as the urban
terrorism of the Tupamaro guerrillas, that led the military to take
over and install a repressive dictatorship that lasted more than a
decade. Now, Vazquez received a respectable welcome. Rising
unemployment and a general cynicism about politicians have helped
his stance as an outsider who will clean up the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Cold War over, everything is different,'' Vazquez
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez's pitch is even viewed by some as conservative in a
country that has had a proud social democratic tradition since
Italian and Spanish immigrants formed a political movement at the
turn of the century that nationalized most industry and established
unemployment compensation. Vazquez says that the Blanco and
Colorado parties want to dismantle the welfare state, which he
intends to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1940s, when we were known as the Switzerland of South
America, we didn't have the unemployment we have today,'' Vazquez
said. ``We want to recuperate our old values and form of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Before large urban audiences, Vazquez is a stirring speaker. On
the stump in the provinces, he moderates the rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quietly, gradually, calmly and within the Constitution,'' he
promised an audience of 150 people in Fray Marcos, ``we will
transform the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he has stirred fear among some military officers
by promising to investigate the whereabouts of more than 100 people
who disappeared during the military dictatorship, so that their
families can finally locate and bury the victims. He has also
suggested he could include Tupamaros and Communist Party members in
his Cabinet.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The son of a labor-union leader, and the brother of a guerrilla
who was imprisoned, Vazquez did not fight as a rebel. He dedicated
himself to medicine, and became popular by initiating social
programs for the poor youth of Montevideo while managing a local
soccer club.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez catapulted to leadership in the Socialist Party by
playing an active role opposing a referendum that gave the military
an amnesty in 1989. The referendum won, but Vazquez ran for mayor
soon after and stunned all commentators by winning.
</P>
<P>
   As Montevideo's mayor in the early 1990s, he won high marks for
cleaning up parks and the waterfront, while raising property taxes
and salaries for public service workers. He ran for president in
1994 and lost, but managed to attract nearly one-third of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez's true beliefs are a matter of conjecture even among his
supporters in the Frente Amplio coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's left of Felipe Gonzalez,'' said Eleuterio Fernandez
Huidobro, the top Tupamaro leader, referring to the former
socialist prime minister of Spain. ``Of course, these days Felipe
Gonzalez is to the right of Bill Clinton. It's a confused and
confusing world.''

ENERGY DEPTARTMENT PLANS ACTION ON BLACKOUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., N.J., Del., Pa., N.Y.)  (lh) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Energy Secretary Bill Richardson will propose six
steps to reduce electricity disruptions in severe weather in a
speech on Monday, including federal investigations of power
blackouts like the ones that plagued New York and other cities this
month, department officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's speech is scheduled for a convention in San
Francisco of the National Association of Regulatory Utility
Commissioners, whose members serve on state public service
commissions.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks prepared for delivery, Richardson says: ``Clearly, we
need to be concerned. Customers should not have to wonder whether
the lights will go out the next time the thermometer hits 90
degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson will form a team of experts from within the Energy
Department to investigate ``major power outages,'' a department
official said. These would be disruptions resulting from
insufficient generation or transmission problems, but not
distribution problems, like the ones that blacked out a
neighborhood in northern Manhattan in sustained extreme heat two
weeks ago. There is no routine federal investigation of blackouts,
although some states look into some of them, department officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson will also call for a ``regional summit'' of
governors, state public service commissioners and other state
officials in the Northeast to discuss new transmission lines that
can ease supply problems, overcoming local objections to high
voltage lines when they serve regional needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an increasingly difficult issue,'' one department
official said. ``These things need to be looked at on a regional
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   In another step, the department will try to equip the federal
government, which is the nation's largest electricity consumer, to
be more helpful in times of tight supply.
</P>
<P>
   On July 6, the day after the long Fourth of July weekend, when
power was stretched tight during a heat wave, the power pool
serving the District of Columbia _ along with Maryland, New Jersey,
Delaware and most of Pennsylvania _ called big employers to ask for
emergency help in cutting consumption.
</P>
<P>
   In the Energy Department's own headquarters, technicians shut
down some escalators and elevators, and many office workers with
windows turned off their lights. But when a deputy secretary of
energy called the General Services Administration, which is the
federal government's property management agency, and asked that
other agencies be told to do likewise, he learned that there were
no provisions for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really didn't have a governmentwide plan for how to deal
with these things,'' one official said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The department already had plans to issue a new rule in April
2001, requiring central air conditioners for houses to be up to 20
percent more efficient, but Richardson will announce an effort to
get the rule out six months earlier. The effective date would also
be six months earlier, although that might be years away.
</P>
<P>
   The electric supply question is more complicated, experts say,
because of deregulation by the states, which means that many of the
utilities that deliver electricity to customers no longer generate
it, but buy it from competitive producers.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's prepared remarks say uncertainty about what changes
the federal government will make in electricity rules has led some
companies to delay building power plants. His remarks say Congress
should act on an administration proposal made in April, to reduce
this uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal would also increase money available for
conservation efforts sponsored by utilities, which have been
sharply reduced as utilities have begun to compete with each other.
But Congress for the last several years has been unable to agree on
what steps the federal government should take to encourage
deregulation, and the result has been a state-by-state patchwork.

COLOMBIA IS REELING, HURT BY REBELS AND ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Almost every day, it seems, there is some
piece of bad news to lower spirits and raise fears here. If it
isn't one guerrilla group attacking on the outskirts of the
capital, it is another hijacking a plane or blowing up the
country's main oil pipeline. If it isn't unemployment rising to an
all-time high, it is the peso plunging to a record low against the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the government of President Andres Pastrana and the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the Marxist guerrilla group
known to Colombians as FARC, are scheduled to begin formal peace
negotiations aimed at ending 35 years of civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But a rapidly deteriorating political and economic situation has
weakened Pastrana's hand going into the talks, undermining
prospects for peace and emboldening the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to huge profits from the drug trade and kidnappings, the
country's two main guerrilla groups, as well as the right-wing
paramilitary death squads that combat them, are better armed than
ever, and control nearly half the territory of a country larger
than Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A rebel offensive the week before last, launched from a
Switzerland-sized demilitarized zone that Pastrana handed over to
the Revolutionary Armed Forces last November as a gesture of good
faith, forced the government to impose a limited curfew in 10 of
Colombia's 32 provinces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the guerrillas who have taken the reins and are running
the country, not the government,'' complained Ana de Alvarez, a
65-year-old widow living on a pension. ``The president is a Boy
Scout, too much a nice guy for his own good and ours. I hate to say
this, because I voted for him and am a staunch Conservative, but we
need someone with a firm hand to impose order and put an end to
this horrible insecurity.''
</P>
<P>
   A bitter joke making the rounds has two voters trying to
remember why they did not cast their ballots for Pastrana's Liberal
Party opponent in last year's election. ``It was because we were
afraid that he would run the economy into the ground and hand the
country over to the guerrillas,'' one remarks to the other.
</P>
<P>
   In Bogota, home to 7 million of the country's nearly 40 million
people, residents are especially shaken by last weekend's offensive
by the rebels, which demonstrated that the group has the ability to
strike, if only briefly, uncomfortably close to the city. Though
FARC controls much of southeastern Colombia, that area is sparsely
populated, and the group has traditionally avoided campaigns
against urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``On top of everything else, now we have to live with the
constant fear that those bandits can invade at any moment,'' Jesus
Rojas, a jeweler, said. ``We have lost the tranquillity that we had
before as residents of Bogota.''
</P>
<P>
   After sounding the alarm about rebel gains, the armed forces
reversed course, with Gen. Fernando Tapias, the commander in chief,
boasting that his troops inflicted a ``resounding defeat'' on the
rebels, who, he said, lost nearly 300 fighters. But the popular
impression is still that momentum remains with the guerrillas, who
have enjoyed a string of military successes over the last four
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a soccer game in which you are losing 4 to 0,'' said
Alfredo Rangel Suarez, a former government national security
adviser. ``You may score a goal late in the second half, but that
doesn't mean that the game is tied.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, even when the battles against guerrillas and
cocaine cartels were going badly, Colombians could brag about an
economic performance remarkable by Latin American standards.
Through the 1980s and into the 1990s, as countries like Brazil and
Mexico struggled with debt negotiations and austerity, the economy
here was growing at an average of 4.5 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   But Colombia is now experiencing what officials describe as its
most severe economic crisis in 70 years, a result of low prices for
exports, high domestic interest rates and drastic budgets cuts.
Figures announced last week show that the economy contracted by
nearly 6 percent in the first quarter of 1999, the largest decline
in history, and that unemployment has risen to just under 20
percent, another unenviable record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to get a strong position politically when you are
in the midst of an unprecedented recession,'' said Michael Shifter,
a professor of Latin American politics at Georgetown University and
author of an article on the crisis here in the current issue of
Foreign Affairs. ``Colombians are used to dealing with violence and
drugs, but a bad economy has thrown a whole new element into the
situation and accelerated the downward spiral.''
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office, Pastrana has twice had to devalue the peso.
But the Colombian currency continues to slide, reaching a record
low of 1,925 to the dollar on Monday, down more than 35 percent in
the last year, in large part because of market nervousness about
guerrilla advances.
</P>
<P>
   What is worse, the economy does not yet appear to have hit
bottom, and political uncertainty is keeping away the foreign
investment that might help ease the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very difficult days lie ahead in which it will be necessary to
act with realism and without fantasies,'' Minister of Finance Juan
Camilo Restrepo warned on Thursday when he announced that Colombia
had begun negotiating a $3 billion credit from the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official with long experience here said, ``There are no
jobs anywhere for people with skills and education, and so now
you're seeing people, not just capital, trying to leave the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Every sector of the Colombian economy is suffering, but analysts
are most concerned with the decline of agriculture, weakened by an
earthquake in the heart of the coffee-growing zone in January and
low prices for crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worse that things are for the peasants, the more they are
at the mercy of the guerrillas and the more the guerrillas grow,''
said Maria Jimena Duzan, a journalist and author who specializes in
military and drug issues.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The deterioration is also souring Colombia's relations with its
neighbors. President Alberto Fujimori of Peru, for instance,
ordered troops to the Peru-Colombia border after the rebels began
their latest offensive, and has been anything but diplomatic in
criticizing Pastrana's carrot-and-stick approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all of this process of terrorist advances continues, I do
not have the slightest doubt'' that Colombia ``can constitute a
threat to the continent,'' the Peruvian leader said in an interview
with the Bogota daily El Espectador. His government's policy, he
added, is that ``we do not give in to blackmail, we're not willing
to have any kind of contact or dialogue with terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the United States has publicly expressed support for
Pastrana and his peace efforts, there is growing concern in
Washington that, as a U.S. official put it, Pastrana ``is giving
away the store.'' A report on Colombia by the Government Accounting
Office last month quoted the U.S. Embassy here as complaining that
the Pastrana administration ``lacks a clearly defined negotiating
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   As polls here clearly indicate, most Colombians agree. They
excoriate Pastrana for failing to demand a cease-fire as a
condition for peace talks, and the vast majority, nearly 90 percent
in one recent survey, say that because the rebel group is more
concerned with maintaining its economic and military power, the
negotiations beginning Monday are doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that Colombians don't want peace, because they do,
desperately,'' Ms. Duzan said. ``But everyone is confused. No one
can tell if we are at war or at peace right now, and so the
president can't get the support he needs to sell his peace project,
and the country is getting more and more polarized.''

   EXP-INDIA-TV-WAR (Mokhra, India) _ India has fought three larger
wars with Pakistan, in 1947, 1965 and 1971, but the last two months
of fighting in the Himalayan land of Kashmir that lies between them
has produced India's first televised war. In 1971, fewer than 1 in
200 of India's households had TV's. Now, it's more than 1 in 3. By

   EXP-SAFRICA-TORTURER (Pretoria, South Africa) _ In his drab
denim shirts and army-style green sweaters, Eugene de Kock answers
questions for hours, rarely showing any signs of emotion. His face
is lineless, his eyes small behind thick glasses that make him look
more like the class nerd than South Africa's most notorious

   EXP-KENNEDY-MISSING-PLANE (New York) _ A small plane carrying
John F. Kennedy Jr. to a wedding on Martha's Vineyard was reported
missing early Saturday, and a search was under way off the coast of
New York's Long Island, officials said. The plane took off at 8:45
p.m. Friday and was believed to be carrying Kennedy, his wife
Carolyn Bessette, and her sister, who were heading to the Cape
Cod-Martha's Vineyard area where the Kennedy family was gathering
for a wedding, a source told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   EXP-APOLLO-REFLECTIONS _ Over dinner a few weeks ago, a former
astronaut who walked on the Moon and one of the Apollo flight
directors got to skylarking about the good old days, something
people do when they think of their past receding and a big
anniversary approaching, in this case the 30th anniversary of the
Apollo 11 lunar landing on July 20, 1969. But without prompting,
they wondered in sadness and perplexity what had happened to the
good old days. Such were the bittersweet thoughts among some of
those of the Apollo generation as they began celebrating the time
when human beings first (and last) set foot on another world. By
John Noble Wilford.

<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ For the last 20 years, each time he walked
into the City Hall he transformed, Mayor Richard Arrington Jr. has
passed by the name T. Eugene Connor carved into the building's
cornerstone.
</P>
<P>
   It is just a name now, one of a list of men now dead who voted
to erect the building, and most people do not even notice it. Even
if it had included Connor's better-known nickname, Bull, the
carving would still seem as out of place among Birmingham's new
skyscrapers and polished corporate headquarters as a hieroglyph
telling an ancient story of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   That sense of distance between the snarling dogs of Bull Connor,
the former police commissioner who became the symbol of intolerance
in the days of the civil rights movement, and the placid,
prosperous Birmingham of today is a result in significant part of
two decades of quiet work by Arrington, who will retire on Monday
at age 64.
</P>
<P>
   When Arrington took office in 1979 as the city's first black
mayor, Birmingham was still struggling to shed its national
reputation as ``Bombingham,'' the city where racial divisions
became explosive in the 1960s and where any police shooting
threatened to turn into a confrontation. One of Arrington's first
efforts was to integrate and tame the Police Department, and the
effect was immediate.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bernard Kincaid, a black member of the City Council who is
usually one of Arrington's sharpest critics, said: ``At the time he
became mayor, if you were an African-American who was stopped by
the police, you didn't know if you were going to be shot and a gun
dropped beside you. Arrington stopped that dead in its tracks. The
outright fear, that shook you down to your boots, is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's economy, crumbling in 1979 after Birmingham's giant
steel plants began to close, has been renewed by a carefully
managed shift toward health care, biotechnology and banking.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate, which soared above 20 percent during the
recession of the early 1980s, is now 4.3 percent, and new
businesses continue to move into 80 square miles of largely vacant
land that Arrington annexed for the city's growth. Many of those
businesses are taking advantage of substantial tax incentives that
he has offered in consultation with a tight circle of local
executives.
</P>
<P>
   But for all that he has accomplished in the region, the mayor
remains a divisive figure in Birmingham. The son of sharecroppers,
a former zoology professor whose political savvy cannot conceal a
quiet, scholarly core, Arrington was never as forceful or
confrontational as the other ``first black mayors'' who dominated
their cities for 20 years, figures like Tom Bradley of Los Angeles,
Coleman Young of Detroit and Richard Hatcher of Gary, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Yet like so many other black mayors, Arrington never attracted
more than a small fraction of the white vote in his five terms, or
established lasting biracial coalitions with other politicians or
white suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of white residents moved to the suburbs during
his tenure, leaving the city with a 70 percent black majority and
shrinking the population by 11 percent, to 252,997 last year from
284,413 in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   An undercurrent of racial tension continues to define the
region's politics, even at the smallest level. Recently, after the
Arrington allies who control the City Council voted to rename a
major street in his honor, white members of the County Commission
grumbled that the new name would require merchants on the street to
get new stationery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been good for Birmingham's image to have someone like
Arrington, who is obviously smart and thoughtful, and provided
steady leadership,'' said Robert Norrell, a historian of the civil
rights movement at the University of Tennessee who lived in
Birmingham for many years and worked for Arrington's first mayoral
campaign. ``But since the 1950s, Birmingham has been deeply and
angrily divided over race, and he hasn't been able to overcome
that. Of course, it's hard to imagine anyone who could.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his office last week while aides scooped hundreds of
honorary plaques off the walls and into packing boxes, Arrington
was unapologetic about the exclusively black nature of his
political organization, the Jefferson County Citizens Coalition,
which became the main vehicle for black enfranchisement in
Birmingham, often at the expense of biracial unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we never said whites couldn't come, but it was a black
organization and we'd like to keep that in place,'' the mayor said.
``Political power was something blacks didn't have in this town
until the 1980s, so we said, `Let's organize, let's bloc-vote,
let's mobilize.' Now people say we've got a political machine, and
they resent it. But that's a cop out. You can't blame everything
wrong in Birmingham on Bull Connor and Richard Arrington.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it may have proved annoying to many white residents, his
effective marshaling of black political power in a state long
famous for its absence has made him an iconic figure to his
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the first time I met him, I was in awe of him,'' said
Norman Davis Jr., a black investment banker in Birmingham who
recently was appointed Alabama's superintendent of banks. ``This
was a man with incredible vision, who knew what he had to do to
keep the city strong despite white flight and the death of the
steel industry. To many blacks, he'll always be a hero, but
unfortunately, a lot of whites never gave him a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Many white voters and elected officials were put off by what
they saw as cronyism in the awarding of contracts and the hiring of
key personnel, a sense that was only enhanced when the federal
government began looking into those issues in a series of
investigations in the 1980s and '90s. Arrington always said the
inquiries were racially motivated, and in 1992 he spent a day in
jail rather than turn over documents to the U.S. attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Two former allies were found guilty of fraud in connection with
the construction of the Civil Rights Institute, a museum of the
struggle for equality that is a tourist attraction. Arrington was
named an unindicted co-conspirator in a kickback scheme, but the
Justice Department later withdrew that designation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has taken care of his friends, but the only white people he
cares about are the corporate leaders,'' said Craig Sanderson, who
is white and the president of the Crestwood Community Association,
which represents a mostly white neighborhood on the east side. ``I
think there are some good things that he did, but I wish he hadn't
played the race card so often.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's physical face is also showing signs of wear in some
places. Many roads, school buildings and low-income neighborhoods
seem forgotten. Birmingham's symbol, a 56-foot iron statue of
Vulcan that overlooks the city from Red Mountain, has deteriorated
so badly that the council voted recently to spend $1 million to
take it down before it falls. Private donors plan to raise an
estimated $10 million to repair and restore it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Arrington acknowledges that the most serious criticism from his
opponents _ his neglect of the school system _ is legitimate.
Birmingham's schools now rank 109th out of the state's 128 school
districts in achievement test scores, according to a recent study
by The Birmingham News.
</P>
<P>
   The ranking actually represents a recent improvement. The mayor
does not have direct control over the school system. But the City
Council, which Arrington controls, appoints the school board.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I regret most of all is, I didn't know the schools were
in quite as bad a shape as they were,'' said Arrington, who has
eight children, most of whom attended public schools. ``I just did
not deal much with the schools, because I had a zillion other
problems to deal with. I felt I had less authority and clout there
than I did in other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   He is stepping down now, he said, because he has done all he can
do and believes the city needs new leadership. But even his method
of departure has caused a stir. Because he is leaving three months
before his term is up, his close ally William Bell, the City
Council president, will become interim mayor and have a leg up in
his campaign to succeed Arrington in the Oct. 12 election.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates, including Kincaid, have complained that the
move is a high-handed attempt to preserve the mayor's dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cannot anoint his own successor,'' Kincaid said.
</P>
<P>
   But unless the black vote begins to splinter badly, most of
Arrington's successors are likely to be black, thanks to an
assertion of power by the once powerless that seemed unimaginable
before he took office. Arrington is explicit in hoping that his
successors will use the political tools he provided to create an
eventual racial reconciliation that he could not achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was first elected, a lot of people expected this town
to go to pot, and I think we surprised them,'' he said. ``That's
going to continue. And the next mayor won't have to fight a lot of
the battles that I fought.''

IRANIAN STUDENTS SUSPEND PROTESTS BUT PRESS DEMANDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Student leaders Saturday announced a temporary
ban on pro-reform demonstrations, but pressed the Islamic
government on a long list of demands, including the resignation of
the country's chief of police.
</P>
<P>
   The decision of student leaders to call off their protests, at
least for the moment, buys time for the country's clerical
leadership in the face of the worst unrest since the early days of
Iran's revolution two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   A communique, faxed to news organizations by the student
leaders, who have called themselves the Select Council of Sit-In
Students, was politely worded and included no threats or ultimatums
if their demands were not met. But it nonetheless put the
government in an awkward position.
</P>
<P>
   The communique asked for meetings with Iran's top leaders,
including Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country's supreme leader, as
well as President Mohammad Khatami and former President Ali Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani, who still wields considerable power as the head
of an important overseeing body.
</P>
<P>
   The student leaders will decide whether to resume their public
protest after those meetings, the communique said. Letters
requesting meetings were delivered to each of the officials on
Friday. A student spokesman said it was important for student
leaders to explain their demands to the country's clerical
leadership in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``The council will put off a decision to hold any demonstration,
gathering or sit-in for the future,'' the four-page statement said.
``So it begs our students and our mature people not to join any
demonstration, gathering or sit-in that could be manipulated by
anarchists and people who favor violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The students' communique, their third since they organized early
last week, also claimed that 1,400 students and other people had
been arrested since the unrest began more than a week ago. The
group demanded that the authorities release the arrested people and
make their identities public.
</P>
<P>
   Although the initial sit-ins and demonstrations were organized
by students, there is universal agreement that their ranks were
infiltrated by nonstudents, perhaps members of the People's
Mujahedeen, the country's main opposition group, or even
pro-government vigilantes. The government has condemned the
demonstrators as saboteurs committed to destroying the stability of
the country, and it will be difficult for it to make concessions.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-member student group is made up of representatives from
11 universities in the Tehran area and two representatives from the
Tehran University dormitories where students were attacked as they
slept eight days ago, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's communique was also far-reaching in that it asked the
government to control ``paramilitary forces'' that have operated
outside the official security system for years. These forces, which
include semiofficial plainclothes security forces and freelance
vigilantes, were responsible for much of the violence against the
demonstrators. Security forces and antiriot police were seen
standing guard and blocking roads as their unofficial surrogates
beat up demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Since his election as president in May 1997, Khatami has made
tolerance and the rule of law and order pillars of his
administration. But he has failed to curb the power of a range of
vigilante forces.
</P>
<P>
   These forces serve as self-appointed morals police in an
unpredictable reign of repression, arresting women in what they
consider un-Islamic dress or breaking up private parties where
Western music is played and alcohol is served.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate letter delivered on Friday to Hedayat Lotfian, the
chief of police, the student group called him incompetent and
demanded his resignation for the good of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brave men are those who serve,'' the letter said. ``And when
they are incompetent they bravely admit incompetence and transfer
the responsibility to someone who is stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting Lotfian's past ``brave'' service to Iran, the letter
added, ``We expect you to bravely resign and bravely admit your
mistakes before your incompetence in safeguarding security expands
to other sectors of the regime and weakens the leadership and the
Islamic Republic of Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to calm the worries of society and the university and
to safeguard the national interest and put an end to the crisis,''
the letter continued, ``and since the participation of the security
forces under your authority and high-ranking commanders in this
catastrophic incident cannot be denied, your resignation seems to
be required.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter added, ``Can you give an answer before God or the
Iranian people if you continue your post as the chief of this
force?''
</P>
<P>
   The students said it was ``very sorrowful'' that instead of
respecting and protecting the country's intellectuals, the official
security forces under Lotfian's command had joined forces with
``pressure groups, vigilantes and savages'' to attack the
intellectuals, ``break the doors of their simple dormitories, wound
them, throw them out of windows and participate in the martyrdom of
the dear children of this nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The communique expressed particular concern about arrests that
the students said had occurred since last Wednesday, the day after
security forces and vigilante supporters used force to suppress
demonstrations that had suddenly turned violent. It added that one
of the members and several supporters of the student group were
arrested on Wednesday as they were distributing an earlier
communique.
</P>
<P>
   The students said that a high school student identified as Tami
Hamifar was killed during the turmoil, the worst unrest since the
early days of Iran's revolution. The body of Ibrahim Nejad, an
off-duty soldier and former student who had been killed on the
night the dormitories were attacked, was returned to his family and
buried, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
   The political crisis in Iran began nine days ago when students
at Tehran University demonstrated in protest of Parliament's
passage of a tough new press code and the closing of Salam, a
popular newspaper that supported Khatami. That night, Islamic
vigilantes followed by official security forces stormed the
dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   For six days students took to the streets in nationwide
demonstrations. After the protests, which probably included
opponents of the students as well, had deteriorated into violent
rioting, security forces and their surrogates swept the
demonstrators off the streets with tear gas and truncheons.

FOOTING SECURITY BILL FOR PRESIDENT UPSETS A BIG-MONEY TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASPEN, Colo. _ This is a town of good and plenty, where a
majority of the population can be divided roughly between the haves
and the have-mores.
</P>
<P>
   While ski slopes in winter and cultural events in summer have
made Aspen one of America's vacation meccas, it is now an
impressive symbol of the nation's economic boom: For almost 60
percent of those who pay real estate taxes in Pitkin County, where
Aspen is the county seat, their residences here are second homes.
</P>
<P>
   And what second homes. Small Victorians near downtown sell for
as much as $3 million; lavish houses hugging the surrounding
mountainsides go for much more. But not all of Aspen's 5,600
year-round residents are always thankful that they live and work in
wonderland. A fair number of them are upset that the town
government is absorbing the costs of a major Democratic Party event
next weekend that will include a visit by President Clinton and his
wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The event is largely planned as a thank-you from the Democratic
National Committee to some of its biggest campaign donors, 100 or
so people who have gave $50,000 each or helped raise $100,000. The
weekend also includes a fund-raising picnic at the (second) home of
Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, when the Democrats staged the first such weekend
event here, Clinton's visit helped them raise about $1 million.
This year, they expect to raise even more.
</P>
<P>
   With all that money around, many Aspenites, including Sheriff
Bob Braudis, cannot understand why local taxpayers have to pay for
all the added security needed for a presidential visit. Last year,
Braudis said, the event cost the town $89,000 for things like food,
housing and even radio batteries for 300 officers from neighboring
law-enforcement agencies who volunteered to help out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were like flood victims,'' Braudis said. ``We housed them
and fed them at the high school and gave them cots to sleep on. The
janitor had turned off the boiler for the summer, so they all had
to take cold showers, then wake up to pancakes for breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was not as if the volunteers got the glamorous jobs, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Secret Service cleared the bridges, looking for any
bombs,'' the sheriff said. ``But then we had to guard the bridges
24 hours to make sure no one planted any. When Clinton went to
sleep, so did the Secret Service.''
</P>
<P>
   While presidential trips are fairly routine in their security
requirements and the demands they place on the local venue,
Aspenites assert that someone else _ the Secret Service, the White
House, the Democratic Party _ should pay for what is essentially a
political event.
</P>
<P>
   The Aspen Daily News recently asked readers in its ``Tipline,''
``Who should pay for Clinton's visit?'' The paper reported on June
27 that ``not one person believes that the local taxpayers should
pick up the tab.''
</P>
<P>
   A collection of reader responses was printed under the headline
``Tipliners to Clinton: `Pay up, or stay out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rachel Richards, who prevailed in a four-way nonpartisan
election last month, said she was thrilled to have the big-money
Democrats in town. Ms. Richards played down any inconvenience they
might be to the town or this year's $22.7 million budget, pointing
out: ``Aspen is a community that likes to have controversy before
breakfast every morning. They need something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Braudis said he had appealed to the Democratic National
Committee for a gesture of good will in the form of a donation to
local charities to match the city's costs. His reasoning went this
way: ``If I have to pay $20,000 for this out of my budget, that's
$20,000 I don't have for other programs.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, he said, the Democrats have not responded to his plea.
But Jenny Backus, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National
Committee, said, ``The DNC has not received any such request, and
if we did, we would refer it automatically to the Secret Service.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Braudis said the local authorities now had a
clearer idea of what help they must provide next week, based on
experience. Last year, the sheriff said, he told Joe DiSalvo, the
department's director of investigations and security coordinator
for the event, to do whatever the Secret Service and the White
House requested.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave them the world,'' DiSalvo said, and that even included
officers patrolling on horseback. But this time, DiSalvo told the
Secret Service that the number of officers would be pared down to
175. And if the president's protectors wanted horseback patrols,
they had better bring their own horses.

TAX PROFESSIONALS SEE PITFALLS IN THE NEW IRS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Nev., Iowa, N.Y., Texas, N.M.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Robert Kolb, a lawyer in Walnut Creek, Calif., 1997 and 1998
were especially good years as people with overdue taxes sought his
help fending off collectors from the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   ``People had to wait two or three weeks just to see me,'' Kolb
said, ``and I had to work weekends to keep up until, finally, I had
to tell my secretary to cut back'' on accepting new business.
</P>
<P>
   Then in December the telephones abruptly stopped ringing.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS, operating under a new law and led by a commissioner who
calls taxpayers ``customers,'' radically cut back on its
traditional collection techniques: garnishing wages, tapping bank
accounts, placing liens on property so the government gets paid
first when the property is sold, and seizing businesses and homes.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS now lets low-level employees make installment agreements
on exceptionally easy terms to people who owe $25,000 or less, on
the theory that it would collect more and write off fewer tax
bills.
</P>
<P>
   To Kolb and other tax professionals across the country who
specialize in dealing with tax collectors, however, it was a
disastrous development for their business. And, they warn,
taxpayers may come to regret the new policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new IRS,'' Kolb said, ``has almost put me out of
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the decline in tax enforcement was prompted by the the
IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, a bill enacted after
Senate Finance Committee hearings in which some taxpayers and IRS
workers accused the tax agency of abuses, though much of the
testimony has since been discredited.
</P>
<P>
   Tax collectors say the new law puts them at risk of being fired
if they make any mistakes, a fear that the tax commissioner,
Charles Rossotti, says is overblown.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one result of a combination of fear among collectors and
the fact that their numbers are shrinking is that wage garnishments
and bank account seizures now run just one-fourth the rate of two
years ago and many tax collectors complain that they have been
pulled off collections to answer telephones and do public relations
work.
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti has repeatedly told Congress that his efforts to make
changes will fail unless the agency gets more money, both for
computer technology and for sufficient law-enforcement resources to
assure taxpayers that chiseling and cheating is being policed
effectively. But just last week the House Ways and Means Committee
voted to cut another $135 million from the proposed $8.2 billion
budget.
</P>
<P>
   But tax lawyers, accountants and tax preparers known as enrolled
agents said in interviews that in the agency's zeal to be friendly,
and to cope with too many demands, tax enforcement has shriveled.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kassel, an enrolled agent in Daly City, Calif., said that
for years two-thirds of his clients came from mailing 1,000 letters
a month to people in the San Francisco Bay Area who had a tax lien
placed on their home or business.
</P>
<P>
   ``So few liens are being filed now that I have seen a drastic
decline in my business,'' Kassel said. ``But I replaced most of my
business by moving my marketing to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Covic, an enrolled agent in Incline Village, Nev., who
teaches negotiation of tax discounts, said that everywhere he
travels, other tax professionals tell of ``much heat within the
service for revenue officers to bend over backwards and solicit
offers to settle and then to help the taxpayer make them into
offers good enough to be accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolb said he encountered this change in attitude recently when
the case of one of his few remaining clients, who wanted to settle
his tax debt at a discount, was assigned to a revenue officer with
a reputation for being aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``She called me and said, `How much time do you want? Thirty
days? Sixty? Ninety?''' Kolb recalled. ``Even before I filed the
offer in compromise papers she called me again to suggest we meet
so she could help me fashion the offer. I was astounded. She told
me that she has to get cases out of her inventory and so closing
the file was all she cared about.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If this keeps up billions of dollars are going to go
uncollected because IRS officers do not want to risk putting their
neck on the block, they just want to close cases and move on. The
IRS is not in an enforcement mode and it is going to cost billions
and billions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRS believes that its new collection strategies will bring
in more revenue, not less, principally by contacting taxpayers
earlier and offering easy payment terms.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Goverman, who is in charge of revising IRS collection
strategies, said: ``We are emphasizing customer service and working
with the taxpayer to come to the proper resolution. When we studied
the best practices of businesses in collecting delinquent accounts
we found that where the customer and the organization came to
terms, especially on a monthly basis, they had a higher success
rate in seeing accounts paying in full, and we believe that taking
hard immediate action will result in our ending up collecting less
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year taxpayers owed $246 billion in overdue taxes, up $12
billion, or 5 percent, from 1997. But more than half of that money
is no longer collectible, the IRS has concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Tax professionals warn that the newer, friendlier IRS policies
are traps for taxpayers, especially in new, easy payment plans.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Oelerich, an accountant in Davenport, Iowa, who serves on a
national IRS advisory panel, said the new policies might create a
class of taxpayers perpetually in debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get an installment agreement for past due taxes,''
Oelerich said, ``the official stance is that if you violate your
installment agreement you can never get another one. But in fact
they will usually sit down and work it out with you because they do
not have the collection manpower to deal with you any other way.
This may turn into disaster because people who owed an amount they
could work out will have larger and larger debts.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Martin, a tax preparer in New York City, said the IRS
often agreed to take too little.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a guy who owes $20,000 and the IRS agreed to $200 a
month in payments,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said he was pleased for his client but, as a matter of
policy, ``that's crazy because the interest alone will be most of
that.'' At the current 8 percent interest rate, it would take
nearly 14 years for the client to pay his past due taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Albaum, a tax accountant in New York, said he had made
deals for as little as $75 a month, far below the interest charges
alone, meaning that each month the taxpayer gets deeper into debt
to the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not a long-term solution, but for the moment it keeps
the IRS at bay,'' Albaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Wellman, a tax accountant in Longview, Texas, who said his
inventory of collection cases had begun to dwindle, warned that
``the new streamlined easy payment plans are a formula for disaster
because it will get some people who had a manageable tax debt at
one time into an easy payment plan this year and next year and the
next year and soon they will end up up owing $50,000 or $100,000
before they get help.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellman predicted that ``next year you will begin to see
problems with people who are in so deeply with the IRS that there
is no way they can pay the debt because of these
installment-payment agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   Marti Myers-Garver, an enrolled agent in Alamogordo, N.M., said
many people were not aware of these nuances because as part of its
new policies, the IRS had made many people with overdue taxes
believe that they did not need to pay for professional help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRS Web site gives you almost everything you need in
almost plain English'' to make payments on or negotiate a discount
of an overdue tax bill, Mrs. Myers-Garver said.
</P>
<P>
   Covic, the enrolled agent in Nevada, said the fine print in
these deals could trap unwary taxpayers by waiving their right to
file personal bankruptcy and have their tax debts wiped out. In
some cases, he said, taxpayers who negotiate a discount on their
tax bill can end up owing the full amount plus penalties and
interest that cannot be wiped out in a bankruptcy proceeding.

SPORTS COLUMN: OK, SPORTS ISN'T SOLELY ABOUT SEX 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Equating sex and sports last week was a mistake for which I have
been taken to task and for which I now apologize. There is far more
to sports than sex. There is also drugs and violence. And they seem
to be fun, too.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs must be even more fun than sex because athletes are
getting so righteous about their right to use. Nearly half the
riders in the Tour de France were de-biked last year for testing
positive for illegal substances, which many of them decried as a
ridiculous witch hunt. Mais oui. I would need to get stoned just to
get on a bike in France the way they drive, so imagine if you had
to also race up and down hills.
</P>
<P>
   Is it irony or what that the current hero of the Tour is Lance
Armstrong of the U.S. Postal Team, who has probably had more drugs
pumped through his body than any other rider in history _
life-saving chemotherapy drugs for testicular cancer that invaded
his lungs and brain. No wonder he is an outspoken critic of mere
performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the rivers of androstenedione that run
through our games. These days, who would even dream of entering a
potato race without a pill or two? Andro, which is banned by the
colleges, the Olympics and pro football, has been a big hit in
baseball, especially after Mark McGwire hit his 70 home runs last
season. He acknowledged a boost from the legal supplement that so
stimulates natural testosterone production that some doctors
consider it a steroid. Baseball has not banned andro, many experts
believe, because it would cast a pall on the home-run record.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, McGwire was legally within his rights to use andro,
and expose himself to possible negative long-term side-effects. But
should he have kept it to himself? As a proud daddy who purports to
understand his role as a model, why did he lead a million kids into
the health-food stores? Unless, of course, he had a higher
obligation to truth and his endorsement contracts. He has since
said that andro does more for his sex life than his baseball
scoring.
</P>
<P>
   And inquiring minds want to know just what was going on when
three past and present Jets, Jumbo Elliott, Matt O'Dwyer and Jason
Fabini, were arrested last weekend for going postal (we should
retire that in deference to Armstrong and his merry mailmen) in a
bar in Long Beach, N.Y. Although there is no evidence of drug use,
these are the 'roid rage dog days, the time of year when pro
football players complete their steroid cycles so the quicker
picker-uppers are out of their systems by the time they are tested.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not forget that performance-enhancing drugs are addictive
in their way. A former Division I lineman, Al Brown, now an
Emmy-award-winning TV cameraman, told me recently about the
``pleasurable fascination'' he felt as his body grew larger and
stronger. He had started taking steroids to compete against bigger
linemen; the resulting sense of omnipotence off the field was as
satisfying. He quit while still in college after his 4-year-old
nephew inadvertently kicked him in the kidney. Brown collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Although it apparently helps, you don't need drugs to be
violent. Here comes Lawrence Phillips again, bad actor at Nebraska
and at several National Football League teams before he stayed out
of jail in Barcelona this spring.
</P>
<P>
   While playing in NFL Europe, he rushed for a record 1,021 yards,
was the league's most valuable player on offense and drew interest
from several more pro teams. Have the shrinks cleared him for
takeoff or are there now 1,021 reasons why he is an acceptable risk
again? The NFL announced last week it would not suspend Phillips
for past infractions if he returned, merely fine him.
</P>
<P>
   The best pro football players, said a very good one, the New
England lineman Brian Holloway, are able to disengage their ``moral
delay,'' that little brake that keeps most of us from responding
immediately and violently to the slightest affront, be it an
oncoming jersey or a sign of disrespect on the street. Some players
can turn it on and off, others wear a permanent game face.
</P>
<P>
   Football is a violent game, and coaches look for violent
players; why do we keep insisting on athletes with split
personalities? These guys give us so much entertainment, they
deserve some slack, a town-sized All-Star Cafe they can trash at
will, rubber walls to cut down injuries, breakaway windows, bowls
of drugs on the bar.
</P>
<P>
   As the Women's World Cup champions continue to sell the
beautiful game with endearing photo ops of goodness, friendship and
nonthreatening sexuality, the more traditional joys of Jumbo seem
increasingly gross and pathetic. Are the bad boys of summer over?
Will the Cup babes reform sports along the way? Jumbo poses nude.
Lawrence admits his chronic thug syndrome and works through it with
Dr. Ruth on ESPN. The estrogenie is out of the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Or, does the old jock culture win. Brandi gets randy, they bulk
up on andro, disengage their moral delays and start swaggering
through SportsWorld, pony-tails whipping, showing a new generation
of 10-year-old girls how to take back the schoolyard.

NBA NOTES AND NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Knicks' Coach Is Back, but for How Long?
</P>
<P>
   First, the precarious nature of Coach Jeff Van Gundy's job
status was supposed to end when Allan Houston's jump shot propelled
the Knicks past the despised Miami Heat in the first round of the
playoffs. When that did not happen, it was assumed that Van Gundy
would be granted his desired security as a result of subsequent
victories over the Atlanta Hawks and the powerful Indiana Pacers
and the Knicks' gallant effort against the San Antonio Spurs in the
NBA finals.
</P>
<P>
   But even though those achievements assured Van Gundy of another
season at the helm, they may not have delivered what many presumed
they would: a long-term contract extension for the embattled coach,
who has two years left on his existing deal.
</P>
<P>
   While preparing for this week's mini-camp and next week's
rookie/free-agent summer league in Boston, Van Gundy waited _
perhaps in vain _ for Dave Checketts, the Madison Square Garden
president, to call and initiate discussions on a contract
extension. Van Gundy said he was not concerned, but he realizes
that the lack of a contract extension could lead to another season
of uncertainty and unwanted, behind-the-scenes suspense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave's been busy with some other things,'' Van Gundy said.
``I'm sure everything's going to be fine, but we haven't done
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, nothing seems necessary since Van Gundy will be
paid $2 million this season and $3.5 million the next. But without
long-term security, the upcoming season becomes little more than a
probationary period for Van Gundy. If the Knicks do well, he will
very likely have his contract extended beyond the 2000-1 season. If
they fail to meet Checketts' standards, the Knicks could easily
choose to replace Van Gundy and take a relatively small $3.5
million hit for buying out his final year.
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, Van Gundy will have to maneuver smoothly
through a minefield of potential eruptions on his club, the most
predominant issues being Patrick Ewing's role, Latrell Sprewell's
place in the lineup and the use of Marcus Camby.
</P>
<P>
   While the debate about whether the Knicks are better with Ewing
or without him continues, there is little question that the future
Hall of Famer must accept a diminished role in the offense. Last
season, Van Gundy proved unwilling to take the ball away from
Ewing, who has been the coach's greatest supporter within the
organization. The result was that a team stacked with thoroughbreds
was confined to a plodding half-court offense and played beneath
expectations during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until injuries limited Ewing to the role of defender,
rebounder and mere component of the offense _ as opposed to its
main feature _ that Sprewell, Camby and the rest of the Knicks took
off. But Ewing plans to be healthy next season and shortly after
the finals made it clear that he expects to play the same role he
always has _ the focal point. That puts the onus on Van Gundy to
keep his center happy while at the same time limiting his role.
</P>
<P>
   Before injuries forced his hand, Van Gundy had Sprewell coming
off the bench, which irritated the former All-Star guard. After his
outstanding performance in the playoffs, Sprewell will not want to
return to being the sixth man, and, like it or not, Van Gundy has
little choice but to start him. Sprewell is in the last season of
his contract, and if displeased with Van Gundy, he will have the
option of leaving as a free agent _ with the Knicks getting nothing
in return. That would not increase Van Gundy's popularity with the
fans or the front office.
</P>
<P>
   The situation surrounding Camby is not as volatile since he will
accept coming off the bench. But he must play a lot of meaningful
minutes, and the Knicks must play a style that takes advantage of
his tremendous ability. Camby expressed dismay last season with
what he viewed as Van Gundy's biased treatment of him because of
the coach's fondness for Charles Oakley and, after his excellence
in the playoffs, he now has the stature to affect Van Gundy's
future.
</P>
<P>
   In the past Van Gundy sometimes catered to Ewing and ignored the
wishes of Sprewell and Camby, but without a contract extension, he
will not have the security to do so this season.
</P>
<P>
   Timberwolves Surviving
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Timberwolves lost two All-Star caliber players in
Tom Gugliotta and Stephon Marbury within one year, which would
crush most teams. But the Timberwolves are not far from where they
were when Gugliotta, Marbury and Kevin Garnett formed what appeared
to be the nucleus of the future in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   After Gugliotta left Minnesota in free agency to play for
Phoenix last season, the Timberwolves were fortunate to land Joe
Smith, the former No. 1 National Basketball Association draft pick
who soon could be as good as Gugliotta. Then, when Marbury forced
them to trade him to the Nets, they acquired Terrell Brandon, a
two-time All-Star point guard who is just a notch below Marbury.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, the Timberwolves feared losing both Smith and
Brandon to free agency, but it appears that both will return to
Minnesota to keep the team on the heels of the Western Conference
elite. Both are near certainties to sign with the club in August.
They should team with Garnett and the newcomer Wally Szczerbiak to
give the Timberwolves a solid and talented core.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon is meeting with the Timberwolves' owner, Glen Taylor,
tomorrow, and Bill Duffy, Brandon's agent, expects an agreement to
be reached in principle soon thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're inclined to sign,'' Duffy said. ``They want Terrell
back, and I believe he wants to be back. We're just going to hope
that we're on the same page.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the parties may be a few pages apart, but the divide
should be closed quickly. The Timberwolves would like to get
Brandon for about $7 million a season and cite his history of
injuries _ he has missed 46 games the past two seasons _ as the
reason for the relatively low figure. While Duffy refused to
discuss his client's salary desires, Brandon, 29, is believed to be
looking for a six-year deal that averages $10 million or $11
million a season.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations should be cordial since Duffy is a longtime
friend of the Timberwolves general manager Kevin McHale. In fact,
when it became apparent that Marbury intended to leave Minnesota,
Duffy actively helped to deliver Brandon as his replacement, a
gesture the agent is sure to bring up during negotiations. Brandon
went on to average 19.3 points, 7 assists and 7.5 rebounds as the
Timberwolves gave San Antonio its toughest test of the playoffs
before losing, three games to one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Timberwolves are just a couple of players away,'' Duffy
said. ``And I'd like to take some credit for that because we were
involved with getting Terrell there.''
</P>
<P>
   It's Good to Have a Shooter
</P>
<P>
   While Cleveland has been roundly criticized for selecting Trajan
Langdon, a 6-foot-3-inch jump shooter from Duke, with the 11th pick
of the draft, Wayne Embry, who recently resigned as general manager
of the Cavaliers but remains as the club's president, defended the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you rather have a guy who can make a shot off your
offense or transition, or would you rather have a guy who can
create but can't make a shot?'' Embry asked, denouncing the idea
that Langdon's inability to slash to the basket makes him a
liability. ``When you've got a strong inside game, you have to
protect your big men, and we've always tried to do that. You've got
to guard shooters, so that opens up the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   In Langdon, his fellow draft pick Andre Miller (No. 8 overall),
Brevin Knight, Derek Anderson, Bob Sura and Wesley Person, the
Cavaliers have one of the deepest backcourts in the league, one
that should allow them to play the up-tempo style that the new
coach, Randy Wittman, is espousing. To free up the logjam, Person,
an excellent shooter, will play lots of small forward.
</P>
<P>
   If center Zydrunas Ilgauskas, who missed most of last season
with a broken left foot, is healthy, the Cavaliers, led by the
All-Star power forward Shawn Kemp, could be one of the best teams
in the wide-open Eastern Conference.

THREATENING UMPIRES ARE TAKING A HUGE GAMBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Said a man with great insight into the way the real world works:
``You never ask for something you might get.''
</P>
<P>
   He was applying this cautionary wisdom to the umpires' announced
intention to resign Sept. 2, leaving the last month of the season
and the playoffs and World Series to less experienced and skilled
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Although Commissioner Bud Selig and other high-ranking officials
have carefully avoided making public comments about the umpires'
negotiating ploy, they are portrayed by people who have spoken with
them as outraged and intent on letting the umpires walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making a mistake if they think they're going to resign
and still umpire,'' said an official privy to Selig's thinking. He
added that barring a change in that thinking, Selig will accept the
resignations and wish the umpires well in their future careers.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires have certainly won no friends with their surprising
declaration, not that they had many to begin with, which is sort of
their point in taking such a severe step. But their attempt to gain
respect could turn their resignation hammer into an unemployment
boomerang.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Richie Phillips, the umpires' union leader and chief
strategist, a lawyer with links to baseball management said:
``Richie is looking for something he's not going to get. Bud and
the owners will see this as a chance to get rid of Richie and break
the union.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips is counting on baseball's experience with replacement
umpires to prompt Selig and Sandy Alderson, who has been the point
man in umpiring matters, to negotiate a deal by Sept. 2. In
previous work stoppages, everyone, including fans, has clamored for
the return of the regular umpires once the replacements missed a
few calls.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, officials are buoyed in their resolve to hold
firm by the reaction of fans and news media critics. Fans at
major-league parks have booed the umpires, and columnists have
blistered the umpires in virtually unanimous fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Club owners, who have been described as ``enraged,'' are urging
Selig to adopt a hard-line stance. The umpires will find no
supporters in the players. ``Whatever happens, the game will go on,
and the players will deal with it,'' said the Yankees' David Cone,
the union's American League player representative.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires will be alone as they march toward Sept. 2, their
letters of resignation perhaps serving as death warrants. Phillips
is betting otherwise, but this is by far his biggest gamble.

THE LANDSCAPE CHANGES FOR LAST SEASON'S TOP 4 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When we last left the National Football League's final foursome
_ Denver, the New York Jets, Minnesota and Atlanta _ each team was
vowing it would return to at least the conference championships. It
is easy to understand why.
</P>
<P>
   John Elway was still hinting he might come back to the Broncos'
corral. Jets players, at a postseason party soon after arriving
home from the conference championship loss to Denver, said they
were going to be the team to beat. The Vikings were in a state of
depression but eagerly looked forward to proving their season was
no fluke, while the Falcons took up residence on cloud nine.
</P>
<P>
   Things change quickly. Elway retired and was replaced at
quarterback by Bubby Brister. Two Jets players were arrested this
past week after getting into a fracas in a Long Island, N.Y., bar.
The Falcons and their star running back, Jamal Anderson, are in a
bitter contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
   And Minnesota? Despite the bitter loss to Atlanta, Vikings
players are mentally strong.
</P>
<P>
   Training camps across the league open this week, and certainly
the status of the top four from last season is among the flashier
story lines, but in fact almost each franchise has something
interesting going on.
</P>
<P>
   One good example is the expansion Cleveland Browns. The rookies,
who include quarterback Tim Couch, the No. 1 draft pick overall,
report on Wednesday. At some point Coach Chris Palmer plans on
showing a tape to the team about the history of the Browns'
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Giants' rookies and veterans are scheduled to report July 29 in
Albany. One day later, the Jets' camp begins at Hofstra University
in Hempstead on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   As for the rest of the league, everything begins with the
Broncos, who will be without Elway for the first time in 16 years.
Opposing coaches and players have doubts that Brister can lead
Denver to another Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, the Jets are considered the favorite to win the
American Football Conference, though that could depend on the
status of offensive linemen Jumbo Elliott and Jason Fabini. Those
two were involved in a scuffle at a bar last weekend that resulted
in the arrest of Elliott, Fabini, and the Cincinnati Bengal lineman
Matt O'Dwyer, formerly a Jet. Originally, it was thought that
Elliott, who was accused of punching a woman during the incident,
might face a suspension under the league's violent-crime policy.
</P>
<P>
   But the league's decision about Lawrence Phillips, who pleaded
no contest to an assault against a woman in Miami last year, might
have been a break for Elliott. The league announced that if
Phillips rejoins the league after playing in NFL Europe this
spring, he will receive a substantial fine, but not a suspension,
after he signs a contract.
</P>
<P>
   In the National Football Conference, the Falcons are a different
team from the one that upset the Vikings. Wide receiver Tony
Martin, accused by the federal government of laundering drug money,
left for Miami. Linebacker Cornelius Bennett and safety William
White, both leaders on defense, are gone, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons may have made a mistake in alienating Anderson, who
wants a deal in the vicinity of what Denver's Terrell Davis earns,
which is $56 million over nine years. The Falcons are balking, and
during the April draft they explored trading Anderson, who could
miss the start of camp July 28 over his contract dispute. Some
Falcon players are angry at the way the team is treating Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings are the only team of the four that seems in perfect
harmony. Minnesota lost no major free agents, wide receiver Randy
Moss has stayed out of trouble, and there was an extra sense of
urgency at Cris Carter's annual training camp. Minnesota, for now,
is focused.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking forward to this season,'' Coach Denny Green
said. ``I don't think you'll see this team take a step back.''
</P>
<P>
   Training camp is a time when every team is optimistic. Right
now, around the league, coaches are returning from their vacations
and dreaming of a championship. Here's how the divisions should
actually shake down in December:
</P>
<P>
   AFC EAST: Buffalo, behind quarterback Doug Flutie, should win at
least nine games. Indianapolis is not ready to challenge for the
division title. New England needs a proven running back. Miami made
some interesting moves this off-season _ possibly dangerous ones _
by picking up Martin and drafting the troubled running back Cecil
Collins.
</P>
<P>
   AFC CENTRAL: The Baltimore Ravens could surprise some teams
thanks to the offense of their new coach, Brian Billick. The
Bengals are the Bengals. In Pittsburgh, quarterback Kordell Stewart
has a new contract. The Tennessee Titans, formerly the Oilers, seem
poised to make a playoff run. The team to watch in this division is
Jacksonville; the Jaguars are capable of getting to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   AFC WEST: Even if Brister is so-so for the Broncos, the
defending Super Bowl champions still have enough firepower to win
11 games.
</P>
<P>
   NFC EAST: The Giants, if their quarterback situation settles
down, will probably fight Arizona for the division title.
</P>
<P>
   NFC CENTRAL: The Vikings should win the division, but Green Bay
and Tampa Bay will be only a half-step behind. The Lions are still
panicking about Barry Sanders, who isn't answering their calls.
</P>
<P>
   NFC WEST: It's a two-team race between the Falcons and the
49ers.

CHECKING IN WITH A WORKHORSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   They don't make them like Warren Spahn anymore.
</P>
<P>
   In a 17-season span from 1947 through 1963, he averaged 35
starts, 21 complete games, 278 innings and 20 victories a season.
He was a 20-game winner 13 times and led the National League in
victories eight times, including in five successive seasons. He
pitched a no-hitter in 1960 at age 39, then pitched another in 1961
five days after his 40th birthday. Pitching at age 42, he matched
his career high in victories with 23 in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Spahn, the No. 1 left-handed winner in history with 363
victories, follows baseball closely and, not surprisingly, he
doesn't like the pitching developments he has seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what baseball does today,'' he replied on the day of the
All-Star Game in Boston, where he was asked for his views on
pitching circa 1999. ``They count pitches. They pitch once a week.
I don't approve of those things. I don't agree, but that's baseball
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Did all of that pitching he did, starting every fourth day,
sometimes every third, have any ill effects on him?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said, dismissing the notion as absurd. ``One of the
things I dislike about baseball today is we've made nonathletes out
of pitchers. They pitch once a week. They count the pitches. They
don't hit. they don't run the bases. That's not my kind of
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   And one more thing. ``Everybody in baseball is crying about
pitching and they've got 10 guys sitting there that aren't
pitching,'' Spahn said. ``Why? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Are the pitch count and the radar gun the two worst things that
have happened to pitching? ``I think so,'' he said. ``That's my
opinion. Today's baseball came up with the gun and everybody's
impressed if you throw 98 miles an hour, but nobody talks about
what the ball does.''
</P>
<P>
   Spahn, whose victory total is fifth highest in the history of
baseball and the most since Grover Cleveland Alexander, who retired
in 1930 with 373, is a spry 78-year-old Hall of Famer who sees
little to like when he looks at pitching in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Atlanta Braves are probably a throwback to what we were,''
he said, standing outside so he could smoke. ``They have their
pitchers throw every day, they pitch in a regular rotation and they
have been successful. Look at the guys they've come up with.''
</P>
<P>
   And look at their pitching coach. There is a link between Spahn
and that coach, Leo Mazzone. His name is Johnny Sain, as in ``Spahn
and Sain and pray for rain.'' Later, when Sain was a pitching coach
in the Atlanta organization, Mazzone became a disciple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' Spahn said when the connection was mentioned. ``I
was in Atlanta, and Leo wanted to pick my brain about pitching.
He's smart. He'll listen. He wants information, and he'll use that
information, so that makes him a good coach. You look around the
league and see who the pitching coaches are, and what did they ever
accomplish to be the one to say this is what you should do, young
man?''
</P>
<P>
   Mazzone, who as the Braves' pitching coach has supervised the
best starting rotation of the 1990s, first encountered Sain in West
Palm Beach, Fla., in 1979. Sain was in charge of pitching in the
Braves' minor-league system, and Mazzone was a 30-year-old Class A
pitching coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took me under his wing,'' Mazzone said. ``Every night he'd
invite me to his trailer and barbecue. He'd make me some beans and
cornbread and we talked pitching every night that entire spring. I
realized that he had something to offer that nobody else I had come
into contact with had.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazzone listened to Spahn's former pitching partner and learned.
Contrary to the method that prevails now, Sain taught that pitchers
should throw in some manner every day. That's what Mazzone's
pitchers do.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things you see with our pitching comes from Johnny
Sain and what they used to do in the '60s,'' Mazzone said.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise, then, that Spahn should like the Braves and
have no use for those newfangled pitching practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to be stronger with rest, why aren't pitchers
strong at the beginning of the year?'' Spahn asked. ``But you got
to get your arm in shape. I think under the present system they
never get their arm in shape, and that's probably why they have the
injuries they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Jewish Players Are Catching On
</P>
<P>
   Even before the All-Star Game began, it had a record: most
Jewish players on the All-Star teams. Outfielder Shawn Green of
Toronto and catcher Brad Ausmus of Detroit were American League
reserves; catcher Mike Lieberthal of Philadelphia was a National
League reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the number of Jewish players in the major leagues has
``proliferated,'' Green said: ``I think Jewish parents are so
focused on education and studying that there wasn't much emphasis
on sports. I think now maybe kids are getting a little more
involved and playing a little more and getting out there as much as
anybody is.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year it was pointed out to Lieberthal that he,
Ausmus and Jesse Levis, who not long ago played for the Milwaukee
Brewers, were all catchers and that Jewish kids were thought to be
too smart to subject themselves to the rigors of that position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are smart,'' Lieberthal countered with a smile. ``You don't
have to hit to catch. We don't have to hit 40 homers. We don't have
to run. We don't have to steal bases. All you have to do is catch,
and you'll be in this league forever. We get beat up a little bit,
but it's the quickest way to the major leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Tough Luck in Arizona
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit comical in some light,'' Randy Johnson said, ``but
it's a bit scary, like a Stephen King book.'' And that was before
Johnson left a game against Texas with a 2-0 lead, only to have
Arizona's new closer, Matt Mantei, give up three runs in the ninth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Finding his fortunes had not changed after the All-Star Game
break, Johnson suffered yet another lost night. At least he wasn't
charged with the loss. But in his last five starts, Johnson has won
not once while allowing 5 earned runs (6 total) and 25 hits and
striking out 62 in 40 innings. The Diamondbacks have scored a total
of two runs and collected 13 hits. His record is 9-7; it
could-should _ be 14-3.
</P>
<P>
   Weary of talking about his hard luck, Johnson revealed that he
could have signed with Anaheim if the Angels' ownership had been
more responsive to his questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in meetings with the Angels and extremely close to
going with them,'' Johnson said. ``It was a matter of getting some
answers. When we needed some answers from ownership, we were
getting them right away from Jerry Colangelo. The Disney people
that own the Angels took a little bit longer.''
</P>
<P>
   What was his rush? ``I didn't relish being in this position,''
he said. ``It was kind of stressful. I wanted to get it over with
so I would know where I was going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the questions Johnson sought answers to: ``I wanted to
know if ownership would be willing to go out and get somebody in
July when the team was a player away.''
</P>
<P>
   No answer was forthcoming from the Angels. Colangelo, the
Diamondbacks' managing partner, replied promptly. ``He said he had
no problem doing that,'' Johnson said. ``I think what he has done
for this team speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the torturous streak, Johnson said, ``I don't regret
any decision I made.''

   The spaceship crashed, but the two glowing Martians survived and
set out to find a way home. They walked through the forests,
through the fields, and finally came into the city.
</P>
<P>
   They stopped at an intersection and began to shake and moan at
the mere sight of a green light. Suddenly, the light turned from
green to yellow, and then to red.
</P>

   Turning to his traveling companion, one Martian said

   The executive was interviewing a young blonde for a position in
his company. He wanted to find out something about her personality

   `You'll know tonight,` he said.

</P>
<P>
   `Well,` continues the executive, `there's not much positive in

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   The second heat wave of the summer along the Atlantic Seaboard
will pass its peak Sunday as a push of sultry air from the South
precedes a weakening cool front. With hazy sunshine, readings will
rise from values near 80 degrees at sunrise to the middle 90s in
many sections from southern New England to the Carolinas. Sultry
breezes will gust over 20 miles per hour in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms will form over the Appalachians around midday and
may organize into a squall line as they move toward the Northeast
coast. Strong winds and small hail could accompany many of the
storms, perhaps leading to spotty power outages.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and thundershowers will cling to the Southeast coast,
with the most numerous storms in the eastern parts of the
Carolinas. The uneven heating of the Smokey Mountains will promote
a few storms. Florida will notice thunderstorms along both coasts.
</P>
<P>
   A stream of very humid air moving northward through the
Mississippi Valley will encounter a jet stream disturbance along a
stalled front in Iowa. This will lead to a complex of thunderstorms
in the Middle West. As sultry air rises over more comfortable air
in the northeast Plains, more thundershowers will develop.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a concentration of thunderstorms in the Four
Corners region, with some storms moving east into the central
Plains. Low pressure in the Northwest will keep conditions cool and
dull in Washington. Much of the Southwest will be bright and warm. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Hazy Skies
</P>
<P>
   The heat and humidity in the East this weekend would not be
complete without the mention of haze. Haze is not just pollution,
as it occurs even in the cleanest environments of the polar
regions. Most often, haze is found in the middle latitudes during
the summer season when the winds aloft become very light. The weak
winds allow for considerable vertical mixing in the lower
atmosphere. As a result, dust, pollen and pollutants are carried
higher into the atmosphere than usual. The presence of humid air
can also produce numerous water droplets that adhere to the tiny
solid particles.

   BUSH-MILITARY _ AUSTIN, Texas _ At a time when the Tet Offensive
was dramatically increasing the number of young Americans in combat
in Vietnam, George W. Bush, then a congressman's kid, found a way
to put on a uniform yet stay relatively safe during the unpopular
war. How he managed to do that is a question that has dogged Bush
since he made his first run for public office six years ago, and it
continues as he pursues a front-runner's campaign for the GOP
presidential nomination. (Ward/Harmon, Austin American-Statesman)

MODELL AND CLEVELAND BOTH STILL BITTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years after Art Modell moved his team from Cleveland to
Baltimore, one of the most controversial acts in the history of the
National Football League, he was asked if he felt his chances of
being elected to the Hall of Fame had evaporated. ``I think that
ship has sailed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Modell left Cleveland in 1995, a move that left the city furious
with Modell and Modell angry with Cleveland. The city feels he
violated its trust and toyed with one of the league's beloved
franchises. Modell believes politicians and civic leaders lied to
him.
</P>
<P>
   Even now the city and Modell remain angry at each other. Modell
has not been back to Cleveland since the move to Baltimore, and he
vows never to return. When the Ravens' vice president for player
personnel, Ozzie Newsome, a former Browns receiver and a close
friend of Modell's, is inducted into the Hall of Fame next month,
Modell will not attend the ceremony in Canton, Ohio, just 49 miles
from Cleveland. He says he does not want to be a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never go back to Cleveland, ever,'' Modell said, ``and
the fact I cannot see my good friend Ozzie inducted really hurts
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision Modell made to move the team has unfortunately
overshadowed more than three decades of outstanding service to pro
football. There are some fans, members of the news media and
politicians who maintain that Modell's move of the Browns, and
especially the manner in which he did it, should keep him out of
the hall.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a travesty. Modell could certainly have handled
the move better. He should have given the city an ultimatum: help
build a new stadium or else. Instead, he negotiated secretly with
Baltimore and then sprang the devastating news on Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Modell's move now seems more benign, with Cleveland having a
new Browns expansion franchise and the act of relocating a team
having become as common as the cold. The Oakland owner Al Davis is
in the hall, though he has moved the Raiders twice. Bob Kraft has
been accused of using the state of Connecticut to get a better deal
from Massachusetts for his New England Patriots. And the Arizona
Cardinals are always threatening to move a second time.
</P>
<P>
   Few owners in league history have contributed as much as Modell.
He spent 32 years on the television committee and, with the former
commissioner Pete Rozelle, helped marry television to the NFL. The
billions of dollars the league now receives from the networks can
be traced in significant measure to Modell's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Modell has served on the league's management council and various
labor committees, and he is the former chairman of the commissioner
selection committee. He realized the potential power of preseason
football and pushed for the NFL to promote it on television.
</P>
<P>
   Modell has not won a Super Bowl championship but neither did the
New Orleans general manager Jim Finks or the Los Angeles Rams owner
Dan Reeves, and both are enshrined in Canton.
</P>
<P>
   The Modell name in Cleveland is associated with treachery. But
that is simplistic. Fearing that estate taxes might force the sale
of the team after his death, Modell moved for financial reasons,
mainly so he could leave something for his family.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland again has a team, and Modell is happy in Baltimore.
Both parties need to put what happened behind them, and Modell
should be remembered not solely for what happened in Cleveland. He
has been too influential in pro football to be judged on that act
alone.
</P>
<P>
   `Arliss' at Work
</P>
<P>
   Every year it's the same silly song. General managers complain
that agents impede negotiations with rookies chosen in the draft
simply because they want to break the bank. Agents respond by
claiming general managers are trying to low-ball their clients.
Isn't there a rule about whining in football?
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, the general managers may have legitimate
complaints. Draft pick signings have been extremely slow. With two
weeks to go until training camps begin in full force, only five
first-round picks have been signed. It's worse with
second-rounders; just four have contracts.
</P>
<P>
   No one keeps records on this sort of thing, but these numbers
are among the lowest in the '90s for this time of year, team
executives and agents agree. And the agents are probably to blame.
</P>
<P>
   In their increasingly competitive world, there are fights for
clients that resemble small wars. Each day in the agent business is
like an episode from ``Arliss.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the competition, agents are making more and more
promises to clients, some legitimate and others outrageous. One of
the more bogus ones is the following.
</P>
<P>
   The agent claims to a prospective client that he can beat the
strict pay system set up by the NFL for rookies. Each salary is
slotted under the system, so that the pay for the 14th pick in the
third round, for example, is predetermined by a complicated salary
cap. There isn't much leeway unless there are highly unusual
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   When agents say during the hotly contested recruiting battles
that they can beat the system, some players, highly gullible,
believe it and sign on.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the month of July. The team wants to get a deal done,
but the agent resists, asking for a salary above the slotted
amount, knowing he probably will not get it. But he can't give in
too quickly because his rookie client might suspect that the
promise was a sham. So the agent waits. And waits. And waits. He
delays as long as possible, then goes back to the client, saying it
is time to sign because he has fought the team as long as possible
and the team is not giving in.
</P>
<P>
   For these and other reasons, the delays in the signing process
continue. Although they are not a recent phenomenon, it does seem
to be an increasing problem.
</P>
<P>
   Moore Waits for Sanders
</P>
<P>
   The Lions would like to sign the Pro Bowler Herman Moore to a
new deal that would possibly make him one of the highest-paid wide
receivers, earning in the $5 million-a-year range. There is a Hall
of Fame impediment to the signing, however: his name is Barry
Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders remains out of contact with the Lions, not returning
telephone calls from team executives and members of the coaching
staff. In fact, he has not spoken to the team since the end of last
season. His status remains questionable, and there is a
possibility, albeit remote, that he might sit out the year.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who has won just one playoff game in his 11-year
career, wants to join a winning team.
</P>
<P>
   There remain persistent rumors that the Lions are attempting to
trade Sanders, something the team strongly denies.

 &HT;    Prospecting for water on the moon
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Thirty years since the first humans blasted off
for the moon, America is about to land on the moon again _ hard.
</P>
<P>
   On July 31, a 354-pound spacecraft named Lunar Prospector will
dive into a crater at the moon's south pole with the force of a
four-ton car moving at 1,100 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   In the last dramatic act of a successful mission, the little
spacecraft will destroy itself for the sake of science.
</P>
<P>
   It's a brute-force way of returning to the moon, but Alan
Binder, the man who conceived Lunar Prospector and the program's
lead scientist, hopes the impact will kick up a bit more evidence _
namely, water _ to support arguments in favor of returning to the
moon.
</P>
<P>
   Since January 1998, the drum-shaped spacecraft has been circling
the moon in an orbit that passes over both poles. Its five sensors
have mapped elements in the moon's ancient crust, including dense
areas of hydrogen atoms. Binder says it's strong evidence _ though
not proof _ that billions of tons of water lie frozen in the
permanently shadowed bottoms of deep craters at the moon's poles.
</P>
<P>
   Large water deposits could help supply a moon base, and Binder,
a longtime lunar scientist, hopes Lunar Prospector's findings will
help revive public interest in the idea.
</P>
<P>
   He also hopes Lunar Prospector's shoestring budget _ just $63
million, including the rocket that launched it _ show that lunar
exploration can be affordable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's where I think man will start his first extraterrestrial
base and colony, and it's a stepping stone for the rest of the
solar system,'' he said last month from from the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames Research Center in
California, where he directs the mission.
</P>
<P>
   America was moonstruck early in the space age. In 1961,
President Kennedy challenged the nation to put a man on the moon
and return him safely to earth by the end of the decade. Just eight
years later, on July 20, 1969, Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong
and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans quickly lost interest after meeting Kennedy's
challenge. The last of six Apollo moon landings took place in
December 1972.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the 25th anniversary year of Apollo 11, a Defense
Department satellite dubbed Clementine orbited the moon for about
three months as part of a technology demonstration. Radio waves it
bounced off the bottoms of craters at the moon's poles showed
tantalizing signs of ice.
</P>
<P>
   Clementine's well-timed findings stirred new interest in the
moon, and the news media followed Lunar Prospector's launch on Jan.
6, 1998. Five days later, it became the first dedicated U.S. moon
mission to enter lunar orbit since Apollo.
</P>
<P>
   After completing its one-year primary mission, the hardy
spacecraft was still running strong, so Binder lowered its orbit to
continue its mapping in greater detail. Now the spacecraft whips
around the moon just 15 to 19 miles above its dusty mountains and
plains.
</P>
<P>
   Lunar Prospector was doomed to crash eventually, because the
moon's uneven gravitational field upsets its orbit. Binder said it
has always been his goal to use its remaining rocket fuel to
``smash the spacecraft into something interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a long shot, Binder cautioned, but with luck Lunar
Prospector will hit a bed of ice suspected to lie at the bottom of
a deep crater. With more luck, the crash will throw up a plume of
water molecules just big enough for telescopes on earth to detect
it.
</P>
<P>
   A spurt of water molecules from the crash would prove the
existence of water on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if it's water. We believe it is but we have no
real proof,'' Binder said. ``This is a way to use the spacecraft to
get the last drop of science out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists have long believed craters at the poles, where
the sun barely peeks above the horizon, could trap water as ice in
their permanently shadowed depths. Prior to Clementine, lunar
missions only explored a narrow band along the moon's equator.
</P>
<P>
   Lunar Prospector's data indicates some six billion of tons of
water may lie in frozen pools or mixed with soil. The findings
excite some space advocates who say it could cut the cost of space
exploration by providing a source for water, air and rocket fuel
(water can be split into oxygen and hydrogen.)
</P>
<P>
   Exploring the moon is what Binder, a lunar scientist since the
1960s, thinks humans should do next in space. Not surprisingly, he
thinks President Nixon was wrong to terminate the Apollo program
and cancel its last two scheduled missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Apollo) should never have ended in my opinion, and if it
hadn't we'd already be on the moon permanently,'' Binder asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Binder has been trying to restart the earth's exploration of the
moon almost since it ended with Luna 24, a Soviet robot lander that
scooped up soil samples in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching in Germany, he advised the European Space Agency on its
plans for a lunar orbiter and later developed a proposal for a
joint U.S.-German program to study the moon with a series of robot
landers.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the U.S. in 1983, Binder said he was struck by the
ponderous pace and astronomical expense of NASA's space science
programs. He proposed Lunar Prospector as a model for cheap, simple
space missions.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, NASA Administrator Dan Goldin began pushing the
concept of ``faster, better, cheaper'' space science missions.
Lunar Prospector became the first mission under its no-frills
Discovery program.
</P>
<P>
   Binder said Lunar Prospector operates more like a commercial
operation than typical NASA missions. NASA funded the program, but
Binder said he's operating the spacecraft for NASA as an
independent contractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I deliver to NASA is simply the data,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Binder wants to find private investors to fund lunar
exploration as a commercial enterprise. Instead of funding the
operation up front, NASA would pay for the scientific results as
they were produced.
</P>
<P>
   Binder envisions a series of unmanned moon landers and rovers
that would lead to the establishment of a manned lunar base.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know how to build a lunar base. We've known that for years
and years and years, but it's a matter of taking all the studies
that have been done and actually doing it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And doing it more efficiently than NASA has done other programs,
such as the long-overdue International Space Station.
</P>
<P>
   Binder claims a base could be built using off-the-shelf hardware
for about $10 billion - less than half the cost of the space
station, although the moon base would get part of its cost savings
by using hardware developed for the space station.
</P>
<P>
   Binder believes it's time to get back to the moon, and the
sooner the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would hope this would all culminate in a lunar base, in
say, 2010, which would really be the beginnings of the colonization
of the moon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the meantime, Binder admits he's having a lot of fun with
Lunar Prospector.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm flying a live spacecraft around the moon,'' he marveled.
``This is great fun. As I keep telling everybody, I have the best
computer game in the world.''

 &HT;    A safe landing off Sea of Tranquility
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Editor's note: This account is based on an annotated NASA
transcript of Apollo 11 communications.
</P>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In the infinite vastness of deep space, two
gleaming spacecraft drew apart as they sailed 69 miles above the
gray, forbidding landscape of the moon.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-million miles from earth, Michael Collins watched in
Apollo 11's command module Columbia as Wapakoneta native Neil
Armstrong and Edwin ``Buz'' Aldrin slid away in the lunar module
Eagle.
</P>
<P>
   Eagle was a boxy-looking spaceship with four spiderlike landing
legs. Inside, it was so small and Spartan it didn't even have
seats. Armstrong and Aldrin flew in a standing position, clad in
their white moonsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Four days earlier, on July 16, 1969, they had blasted off from
Florida on a Saturn 5 rocket to make the first human landing on the
moon.
</P>
<P>
   Now it was time.
</P>
<P>
   ``See you later,'' Armstrong radioed Collins.
</P>
<P>
   As they looped behind the moon, Armstrong and Aldrin fired
Eagle's descent engine to drop it into a 69-by-10 mile orbit. If
everything went well, the engine would fire again when they reached
the low point, and this time it would keep firing in a powered
descent all the way to the lunar surface.
</P>
<P>
   But problems cropped up from the moment Eagle came back around
the moon and made radio contact with Mission Control in Houston,
Texas. Its radio signal _ the astronauts' voices and the vital data
from Eagle's systems _ kept cutting in and out. They had to keep
turning the lander or switch antennas to regain contact.
</P>
<P>
   Mission controllers got enough data to see that Eagle was in
good shape. Back in Houston, fellow astronaut Charlie Duke manned
the radio: ``Eagle, Houston. If you read, you're go for powered
descent.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins had to relay the news to his crewmates while they worked
to re-establish contact with Houston. But the rest of the countdown
went smoothly and the descent engine fired right on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ignition,'' Armstrong and Aldrin chorused.
</P>
<P>
   With the engine braking its speed, Eagle fell in a long arc
towards the Sea of Tranquility _ a dark, flat plain on the near
side of the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is looking good here,'' Duke radioed.
</P>
<P>
   Eagle was traveling tail first with its windows facing the
cratered lunar surface. Timing landmarks as they went by, Armstrong
realized Eagle was farther downrange than it was supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're long,'' he said to Aldrin.
</P>
<P>
   Following the schedule, Armstrong rolled Eagle on its back to
point its landing radar toward the surface. The radar came to life;
steering jets fired, jolting the astronauts as it made corrections.
</P>
<P>
   But the radar's data was flooding Eagle's tiny computer memory.
An alarm buzzed loudly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Program alarm,'' Armstrong called out. ``It's a 1202.''
</P>
<P>
   This was an alarm neither he nor Aldrin recognized from
simulations. For all they knew, they might have to abort the
landing at any second _ a disappointing and dangerous procedure.
</P>
<P>
   But Houston quickly analyzed the situation and decided the
computer was OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're go on that alarm,'' Duke said. The alarm kept sounding,
but each time Houston judged it OK.
</P>
<P>
   At 7,500 feet above the moon, Eagle began pitching over into
landing position. Armstrong looked out his window across the
cratered Sea of Tranquility. He was trying to judge their touchdown
point, but the computer kept triggering alarms, each time raising
the possibility of an abort. Houston continued to tell them ``go,''
but the constant alarms distracted Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Now they were just 1,000 feet up, and Eagle was taking them
right towards a crater littered with boulders the size of cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty rocky area,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   He took control of the lunar module to slow its descent and flew
past the crater. The ground coming up was still thick with
dangerous boulders. Armstrong slowed the craft again while he
scanned the ground for a clear spot.
</P>
<P>
   Eagle dropped below 300 feet, and Armstrong spotted a likely
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK. Here's a ... Looks like a good area here,'' he said, but a
moment later he decided it wasn't safe. He flew on while precious
fuel, altitude and time dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   A light came on, indicating only a minute's worth of fuel
remained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixty seconds,'' Duke warned.
</P>
<P>
   But Armstrong had found a landing spot, and he was easing Eagle
down and forward towards it.
</P>
<P>
   Aldrin chanted the altitude and rate of descent: ``Forty feet,
down 2 1/2. Picking up some dust.''
</P>
<P>
   The rocket's exhaust gases reached the surface. Dust streaked
out in all directions through the airless void, obscuring
Armstrong's view of the ground. He brought Eagle down gently,
fighting its sudden tendency to drift.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty seconds,'' Duke warned. Their fuel was all but gone.
</P>
<P>
   Ten-foot-long landing probes sticking down from three of Eagle's
landing pads touched the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contact light,'' Aldrin said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was supposed to cut the engine and let the lunar
module drop the last few feet, because engineers feared the
rocket's exhaust so close to the ground could bounce back into the
engine and blow it up.
</P>
<P>
   But Armstrong was completely focused on the landing; he touched
down so gently that neither man felt a bump.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shutdown,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The astronauts quickly went through their post-landing
checklist. Then they turned to each other, grinned through their
bubble helmets, and shook hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston, Tranquility base here,'' Armstrong radioed. ``The
Eagle has landed.''

 &HT;    Little known Mexican police group protects immigrants trekking
to U.S.
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MATAMOROS, Tamaulipas _ In a narrow ravine on the Mexican side
of the Rio Grande, hidden from the U.S. Border Patrol's floodlights
and night-vision scopes, four would-be illegal immigrants huddled
together, waiting for opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the flashlight beam from above found them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on out, muchachos, don't be scared,'' said the man in the
faded jeans with the pistol on his hip. They hesitated. He could
have been one of the river bandits who prey on those preparing to
sneak into the United States. Or a crooked cop trying to shake them
down for cash. He could have been anybody.
</P>
<P>
   After the group reluctantly climbed up into the warm night air,
Erazmo Antonio Alaniz tried to ease their fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm with Grupo Beta,'' he told them. ``My job is to help you,
protect you, and make sure nobody harms you.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaniz, a 27-year-old Matamoros police officer, is part of
Mexico's own small but growing border patrol, a collection of
police and immigration officers assigned to protect the hundreds of
thousands of migrants who cross the border into the United States
every year.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission is to arrest the bandits, narcotics traffickers
and immigrant smugglers who operate on the border, Alaniz said.
They do not interfere with people trying to cross into the United
States, which is not a crime in Mexico. Instead, they emphasize the
dangers of the journey: pamphlets they hand out have titles such
as, ``Migrant woman: sexual violence is a real problem. Let us help
you!''
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government launched the first Grupo Beta _
literally, Group B _ eight years ago in Tijuana, Baja California,
to crack down on border bandits who routinely robbed, raped, and
murdered migrants in the canyons south of San Diego. Since then,
five more units have formed in cities along the U.S.-Mexico border.
Two additional units patrol Mexico's border with Guatemala, the
main route for Central Americans heading to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The criminals) take everything from them _ their money, their
pants, even their shoes,'' said Gregorio Gerardo Montalvo, a state
police officer assigned to Grupo Beta in Matamoros.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after the Matamoros unit became the first and only
Beta team on the Texas-Mexico border, its agents have formed close
ties with the U.S. Border Patrol. Despite their different missions,
the two agencies stay in constant contact via radio, advising each
other about possible criminal activity near the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's any problem along the river, Grupo Beta is there to
respond to it,'' said Ernesto Castillo, the patrol agent in charge
of the Border Patrol's Brownsville station. ``They don't alert us
when anyone is crossing, they don't have to _ we're there. Their
job is to make sure that anyone on that riverbank is safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol supervisor Jaime Salazar said his agents recently
came upon a group of smugglers hauling bundles of marijuana across
the river. When the smugglers spotted the agents and swam back into
Mexico, Salazar said, they summoned Grupo Beta members, who made
the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're currently serving time in the Mexican judicial
system,'' Salazar said. ``Whereas in the past, that probably
wouldn't happen _ we would have had the marijuana, but these guys
would have gone scot free.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, the river used to belong to the criminal
organizations. I mean we had all kinds of rapes and murders and
aggravated assaults,'' said Carlos Quevedo, a Brownsville Border
Patrol supervisor who acts as the agency's main liaison with Grupo
Beta. ``Sometimes they would rape women in front of their
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Border Patrol launched Operation Rio Grande in
Brownsville almost two years ago, flooding the riverbank with
agents and high-tech equipment, the criminals have largely
abandoned the Brownsville area and retreated to the Mexican side of
the river.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. agents talk proudly about how they haven't had a single
violent crime reported on their side of the border since the
operation began. It's easy to see why: The Border Patrol has 335
agents in the Brownsville area. Grupo Beta has 18 on their side.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity is the same across the U.S.-Mexico border. In
Nogales, Arizona, Mexican consul Roberto Rodriguez said his office
has urged the Mexican government to send more help to a Grupo Beta
unit in Nogales, Sonora, that has only eight agents, compared to
about 280 Border Patrol agents who are stationed across the border
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Brownsville, Quevedo sees signs of improvement. He parked his
Ford Expedition next to the river and pointed to a neighborhood on
the Mexican side.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see how many people are walking along the river? And guess
why? Because it's safe now,'' he said. ``It's safe because Border
Patrol and Grupo Beta, we're all trying to achieve the same goal,
to make this the safest border in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   They haven't achieved their goal yet. At Brownsville's Ozanam
Center for the Homeless, where many immigrants seek food and
shelter during their journey north, Catholic nun and social worker
Fatima Santiago said the immigrants who pass through still talk
about being robbed by men with guns or knives.
</P>
<P>
   Grupo Beta's statistics also show bandits are still active in
the area: Since January, they say they have interrupted 21 assaults
near the Rio Grande. In some of those cases, they were the intended
assault victims, Alaniz said. They sometimes pose as migrants,
disguised behind dirty clothes, three-day beards, and bags slung
over their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, the agencies have held two joint operations,
with Border Patrol and Grupo Beta agents sweeping their respective
sides of the river on foot, trying to flush out bandits and drug
smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Both agencies say the Border Patrol's night-vision capabilities
have helped reduce crime on the river. Agents with heat-detecting
cameras scan both sides of the river and call Grupo Beta if they
see suspicious activity on the Mexican side.
</P>
<P>
   One night a few months ago, Alaniz said, Border Patrol agents
guided his Beta team to an assault in progress. They arrested three
men beating a pair of Central American immigrants, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Omeheira Lopez, director of the Reynosa-based Center for Border
Studies and Promotion of Human Rights, remains skeptical of Grupo
Beta and a similar migrant-protection group that operates under a
different name in Reynosa, across the river from McAllen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't heard of any abuses by the new police forces,'' she
said, but added that they haven't heard of the units helping
migrants either.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been cases where they have detained groups of
migrants, but the smugglers disappear,'' she said. ``It looks like
there's an arrangement.'' On the Mexican side of the international
bridge linking Brownsville and Matamoros, Grupo Beta's offices are
stark and hot. The plaster walls are water-stained. There is no air
conditioning, little furniture other than worn desks, and agents
peck out their paperwork on an old manual typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   On an office window, families have taped handmade posters with
the photocopied pictures of migrants who have disappeared. One face
belongs to a 15-year-old from Veracruz. Another, a 13-year-old from
Matamoros, vanished May 26.
</P>
<P>
   Alaniz, who has been a member of Grupo Beta for more than two
years, shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're from every part of this country, and lot of other
countries,'' he said. ``There are a lot who live here and go to
Brownsville to cut yards or clean houses and cross every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaniz understands the draw of the United States. His wife is
from Brownsville, and most of his family now lives in Brownsville
and Los Angeles. Like his Beta colleagues, he draws extra pay for
serving on the unit and considers himself lucky to have a good job
in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times, it's necessary for a Mexican to leave his family,
sell what he has, and go to the United States,'' he said, steering
a black pickup truck _ one of Beta's few vehicles _ over rough dirt
trails as Montalvo aimed a hand-held spotlight from the truck bed.
</P>
<P>
   The three young men Alaniz had flushed from the ravine earlier
in the evening were typical. Two came from Tampico, a third caught
a bus from the neighboring state of Nuevo Leon. All talked about
hard times back home; they wanted to find work in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth person, a middle-aged woman who said her name was
Antonia, had come from Saltillo to work as a maid in Brownsville,
hoping to earn enough money to pay for a lawyer back home. Sobbing,
she had told Alaniz her son-in-law had killed her granddaughter,
and she wanted justice.
</P>
<P>
   With Border Patrol agents watching from just across the river,
the group had shuffled away. The young man from Nuevo Leon said he
would find another place to cross the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't bring any money,'' he said. ``How can I get back
home?

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, July 18:
</P>
<P>
   Throughout history, the Moon has been a byword for mutability,
its inconstancy an emblem of the inconstancy of human affairs. One
night it rises dark, a new Moon. One night a sliver of it hangs in
the western sky, nearly catching Venus within its horns. One night
it lies distended on the eastern horizon, not a sphere but a
flattened disk slipping out of Earth's shadow. On no two
consecutive nights has it ever risen at the same time or in the
same shape. Even now, 30 years after humans first set foot on the
Moon, it still seems natural to attribute these qualities to the
orb itself rather than to the perspective from which we view it.
</P>
<P>
   Those who were alive then, a generation ago, will remember many
things about that night, July 20, 1969. Where skies were clear and
dark, people walked outdoors and gazed at the Moon _ a waxing
crescent that just suggested the contours of its dark limb _ then
walked back inside and looked at the scratchy black-and-white TV
transmission from the landing site on the Sea of Tranquillity, then
walked back outside again. Of all the imaginative leaps that
occurred during the preparations for Apollo 11, during the Mercury
and Gemini projects, none were as difficult, because none were as
abrupt, as the imaginative leap that ordinary people faced when
confronted with the fact of a Moon landing. And who is to say which
part of that leap was harder? Realizing that two men really stood
at that moment upon the Moon? Recognizing the technical virtuosity
and determination that had made it possible? Or understanding, for
one profound, unsettling instant, that you, too, like Neil
Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, stood upon a sphere hurtling through the
darkness of space?
</P>
<P>
   If people groped to understand what it all meant while it was
actually happening, we are still groping 30 years later. The iconic
simplicity of that surpassing moment _ Neil Armstrong's leap onto
the Moon's surface _ has obscured the technical complexity, the
sheer engineering will, that lay behind it. The photograph of the
first American flag on the Moon's surface, standing stiffly against
the void of deep space, no longer suggests to us, as it did to some
at the time, that America in 1969 was a nation at war with Vietnam
and with itself. Looking back, you find yourself wondering how it
was possible to send a man from the turbulent America of the 1960s
all the way to the Sea of Tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   What is most surprising about the events of that night long ago
is that they are more surprising now than they were then. The
breathlessness of the moment itself has subsided into mere fact.
But in its place, an inescapable question has emerged. Who were we
then that such a thing was possible? Has the inconstancy of human
affairs carried us away from the grandeur of that accomplishment or
has it simply transmuted the ambitions, the energies that brought
it about? That question will pose itself again before long. Another
30th anniversary is looming. It will come on Dec. 13, 2002, and it
will mark the last time humans stood upon the Moon and saw that
Earth has her vagaries too, that mutability lies in the eye of the
beholder. &QL;

 &HT;    Bush, Gore differ sharply on environmental issues
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ During the 1992 White House campaign, President
Bush dubbed Al Gore ``ozone man'' because of the Democratic vice
presidential candidate's deep interest in global environmental
issues. The vice president has since toned down his environmental
rhetoric, focusing on urban sprawl, an issue with broader appeal.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, son of the former GOP president, scored points
with independent-minded voters in his 1994 campaign for governor of
Texas when he declared that they didn't need Washington to tell
them how to take care of Austin's Barton Springs and other natural
resources. Then he mistakenly shot a killdeer, a protected nongame
bird, on the opening day of dove season and had to pay a $130 fine.
Environmental issues have not figured prominently in the current
presidential campaign _ at least so far. Still, they are virtually
certain to assume a higher profile. Opinion polls show that the
public cares deeply about clean air, safe water and parks.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the campaign issues du jour, which tend to be
decided on a state, local or personal level, environmental policy
is something over which the occupant of the White House actually
wields considerable influence. Moreover, the environment is an area
where the two front-runners, Bush and Gore, appear to differ
sharply.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the environment has been a second-tier issue during
his 4 1/2 years as governor. He has never delivered a major speech
on environmental issues, focusing instead on civil and criminal
justice, welfare, taxes and education. Bush nonetheless
acknowledged the likely role of environmental policy in the
campaign at a news conference just days before he announced that he
was definitely in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it should be a major issue,'' Bush said. ``I think the
environment's incredibly important for the 21st century for
America. I'll address Mr. Gore's positions if I run and if I'm
nominated and if he runs and if he's nominated.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has offered few details about the environmental policy he
would pursue as president. During a recent swing through Washington
state, he said Pacific Coast salmon should be protected in a way
that would not require breaching dams on the Snake River. On global
warming, he says the scientific evidence is sufficient to warrant
concern, but he has not specified whether and how emissions of
carbon dioxide and other ``greenhouse gases'' should be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Bush has pursued a lighter regulatory touch, a
states' rights agenda, a cooperative approach with industry,
deference to private-property interests and aggressive action in
limited problem areas. He sponsored a resolution at the Western
Governors' Association in 1997 calling for increased federal
spending on land acquisition, as well as a boost in the states'
share of such outlays from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a
little-known trust fund financed by offshore oil revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's top legislative priority on the environment this year was
to curb air pollution from older industrial plants that are exempt
from current regulations. He pursued a plan under which companies
would be encouraged to voluntarily scale back emissions.
Environmentalists pressed for mandatory reductions. The governor
got what he wanted from state lawmakers, except for a provision
that triples fees annually for the largest plants if they do not
cut emissions _ an incentive that he did not seek but welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also helped craft an electric-utility deregulation bill
requiring older power plants to reduce emissions. In addition, he
moved aggressively, through legislation and administratively, to
secure improvements in a program intended to provide water and
sewer services to substandard developments along the border with
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bush's mantras is local control, but he has made an
exception for Austin. The Legislature regards the capital city as
too liberal, and so lawmakers have approved several bills in recent
years curtailing the city's powers to regulate development and
water quality. Bush did not push for the laws, but he signed them.
And four years ago, Bush signed a private-property-rights bill to
make it harder for state agencies to impose regulations that reduce
property values. The governor counts cleaner air as his biggest
environmental achievement. But much of the improvement is a result
of the federal Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, signed by his
father and implemented largely under President Clinton. The
governor's appointees to the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission opposed the federal government's tightening of standards
for ground-level ozone and fine particles, an initiative
spearheaded by Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's record on wildlife and parks is also mixed. His
appointees to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission have slowed
the acquisition of new parkland while working to improve management
of current holdings. The governor was silent on proposed state
legislation to sharply increase funding for parks, and the measure
failed.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush helped launch an effort to establish a privately funded
endowment for parks that has secured $4 million in cash and $10
million in pledges, and he backed a voluntary program that protects
wildlife habitat on more than 10 million acres of private land,
said Andrew Sansom, executive director of the Parks and Wildlife
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The governor opposed the listing of the Barton Springs
salamander as an endangered species, arguing that the amphibian,
found only in Austin's Zilker Park, was adequately protected by
state and local water-quality rules. That view was rejected by most
scientists and a federal judge. On the other hand, Bush vetoed
legislation this spring that would have reduced safeguards for
wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   Bush declined to establish a marine reserve along the Gulf Coast
for the endangered Kemp's ridley sea turtle. But his administration
has stepped up enforcement by state game wardens of laws to protect
the turtles from shrimping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush doesn't really seem to put environmental issues on his
list of priorities, much less high on his list of priorities,''
said Ken Kramer, director of the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra
Club. ``It's the old laissez faire approach to dealing with
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barry McBee, Bush's former conservation commission chairman
and now executive assistant to Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, said the
governor backs full and fair enforcement of environmental laws and
demands solid scientific grounding for decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very quick study,'' McBee said. ``The governor's
record will tell the American people that balanced, reasonable
environmental protection will occur on his watch.'' Perhaps no
issue is more important to Gore than the environment. But he has
been careful so far in the campaign not to overplay his hand. Gore
is a card-carrying environmentalist, having written a 1992
best-seller, ``Earth in the Balance,'' an impassioned plea for
vigorous action to combat global warming, ozone depletion and
species extinction. He has been Clinton's environmental point man,
leading the anti-sprawl initiative, promoting stricter clean-air
standards and rescuing negotiations in Kyoto, Japan, on an
international climate treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president learned the danger of appearing too green in
the late '80s, when he ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic
presidential nomination. Global warming and nuclear arms were
``exotic at best'' to voters, as he put it in his book.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign Web site lists four priorities for ``America in
the 21st Century,'' and the environment is not one of them. The
four are education, faith-based organizations, prosperity and
fighting cancer. Don't expect his campaign rhetoric to include such
zingers as this one from his book: ``We must make the rescue of the
environment the central organizing principle for civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's no doubt the environment is at the top of his
agenda. His anti-sprawl initiative _ Gore likes the term
``livability'' _ seems to be resonating with soccer moms stuck in
traffic and other demographic groups. The vice president is pushing
a multibillion-dollar plan to preserve green space and water
quality, ease traffic congestion, expand mass transit and curb
low-density suburban development.
</P>
<P>
   He recently took the podium to announce the administration's
$7.8 billion plan to restore water flow in the Everglades, a plan
supported by Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, brother of the Texas governor.
That was a delicious political moment for the vice president. Not
only did he get to announce a pet project, but he got to do it with
the backing of someone named Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Some activists have been disappointed that Gore has not done
more to push environmental initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the day Gore was elected vice president, he has sought to
moderate some of the messages in his book and has followed a very
balanced and in some respects disappointing environmental policy,''
said John Echeverria, director of the Environmental Policy Project
at Georgetown University Law Center.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bunch, chief counsel of the Austin-based Save Our Springs
Alliance, said Gore has not been aggressive enough in pushing to
protect endangered species and to set aside ecologically
significant lands. Coming from another perspective, author Gregg
Easterbrook, in his book, ``A Moment on the Earth,'' faults Gore
for dwelling on ``end-of-the-world locutions'' while downplaying
good ecological news. ``Someday even Vice President Gore will smile
when he talks about the ecology,'' Easterbrook wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But most environmentalists regard Gore as a longstanding ally.
Twenty years ago, as a member of the House, he co-sponsored the
Superfund program for cleaning up toxic wastes. Long before global
warming became widely recognized as an issue, he held hearings and
sponsored legislation on the subject. He authored legislation to
protect the stratospheric ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   The League of Conservation Voters, the political arm of the
nation's environmental movement, gives Gore a 64 percent overall
rating for his terms in the House and Senate. That means he sided
with environmentalists on 64 percent of key votes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has traveled around the world to study environmental
problems, once spending a night in a small tent on a slab of ice in
the Arctic Ocean. He is comfortable with such technical concepts as
chaos theory, feedback loops and the first law of thermodynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's book, written while he was a senator, traces his interest
in environmental protection to his childhood. He grew up learning
about soil erosion on the family farm in Tennessee, and
dinner-table discussions about ``Silent Spring,'' Rachel Carson's
movement-launching book on pesticides, left a lasting impression.
In 1989, his son nearly died in a car accident, and writing ``Earth
in the Balance'' was part of Gore's effort to find broader meaning
in life.
</P>
<P>
   As vice president, Gore has weighed in to help protect
Yellowstone National Park from mining, to set aside red-rock
canyons in Utah and to safeguard ancient redwoods in California's
Headwaters Forest. And along with Clinton, he has deflected
numerous attempts by Republicans in Congress to roll back
environmental legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's safe to say that the vice president has played a mixed
hand pretty well,'' said Mike Casey, vice president of the
Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit watchdog organization. ``I
don't think anyone can doubt he has a serious commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   George Frampton, chairman of the White House Council on
Environmental Quality, said a lesson of the Clinton-Gore
administration is that an ambitious environmental agenda and robust
economic growth go hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's obviously the major supporter of stronger environmental
measures within the administration,'' Frampton said. ``He's
provided support for people in the administration and agencies to
do good things.''

 &HT;    Bush, Gore differ sharply on environmental issues
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ During the 1992 White House campaign, President
Bush dubbed Al Gore ``ozone man'' because of the Democratic vice
presidential candidate's deep interest in global environmental
issues. The vice president has since toned down his environmental
rhetoric, focusing on urban sprawl, an issue with broader appeal.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, son of the former GOP president, scored points
with independent-minded voters in his 1994 campaign for governor of
Texas when he declared that they didn't need Washington to tell
them how to take care of Austin's Barton Springs and other natural
resources. Then he mistakenly shot a killdeer, a protected nongame
bird, on the opening day of dove season and had to pay a $130 fine.
Environmental issues have not figured prominently in the current
presidential campaign _ at least so far. Still, they are virtually
certain to assume a higher profile. Opinion polls show that the
public cares deeply about clean air, safe water and parks.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the campaign issues du jour, which tend to be
decided on a state, local or personal level, environmental policy
is something over which the occupant of the White House actually
wields considerable influence. Moreover, the environment is an area
where the two front-runners, Bush and Gore, appear to differ
sharply.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the environment has been a second-tier issue during
his 4 1/2 years as governor. He has never delivered a major speech
on environmental issues, focusing instead on civil and criminal
justice, welfare, taxes and education. Bush nonetheless
acknowledged the likely role of environmental policy in the
campaign at a news conference just days before he announced that he
was definitely in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it should be a major issue,'' Bush said. ``I think the
environment's incredibly important for the 21st century for
America. I'll address Mr. Gore's positions if I run and if I'm
nominated and if he runs and if he's nominated.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has offered few details about the environmental policy he
would pursue as president. During a recent swing through Washington
state, he said Pacific Coast salmon should be protected in a way
that would not require breaching dams on the Snake River. On global
warming, he says the scientific evidence is sufficient to warrant
concern, but he has not specified whether and how emissions of
carbon dioxide and other ``greenhouse gases'' should be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Bush has pursued a lighter regulatory touch, a
states' rights agenda, a cooperative approach with industry,
deference to private-property interests and aggressive action in
limited problem areas. He sponsored a resolution at the Western
Governors' Association in 1997 calling for increased federal
spending on land acquisition, as well as a boost in the states'
share of such outlays from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a
little-known trust fund financed by offshore oil revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's top legislative priority on the environment this year was
to curb air pollution from older industrial plants that are exempt
from current regulations. He pursued a plan under which companies
would be encouraged to voluntarily scale back emissions.
Environmentalists pressed for mandatory reductions. The governor
got what he wanted from state lawmakers, except for a provision
that triples fees annually for the largest plants if they do not
cut emissions _ an incentive that he did not seek but welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also helped craft an electric-utility deregulation bill
requiring older power plants to reduce emissions. In addition, he
moved aggressively, through legislation and administratively, to
secure improvements in a program intended to provide water and
sewer services to substandard developments along the border with
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bush's mantras is local control, but he has made an
exception for Austin. The Legislature regards the capital city as
too liberal, and so lawmakers have approved several bills in recent
years curtailing the city's powers to regulate development and
water quality. Bush did not push for the laws, but he signed them.
And four years ago, Bush signed a private-property-rights bill to
make it harder for state agencies to impose regulations that reduce
property values. The governor counts cleaner air as his biggest
environmental achievement. But much of the improvement is a result
of the federal Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, signed by his
father and implemented largely under President Clinton. The
governor's appointees to the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission opposed the federal government's tightening of standards
for ground-level ozone and fine particles, an initiative
spearheaded by Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's record on wildlife and parks is also mixed. His
appointees to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission have slowed
the acquisition of new parkland while working to improve management
of current holdings. The governor was silent on proposed state
legislation to sharply increase funding for parks, and the measure
failed.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush helped launch an effort to establish a privately funded
endowment for parks that has secured $4 million in cash and $10
million in pledges, and he backed a voluntary program that protects
wildlife habitat on more than 10 million acres of private land,
said Andrew Sansom, executive director of the Parks and Wildlife
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The governor opposed the listing of the Barton Springs
salamander as an endangered species, arguing that the amphibian,
found only in Austin's Zilker Park, was adequately protected by
state and local water-quality rules. That view was rejected by most
scientists and a federal judge. On the other hand, Bush vetoed
legislation this spring that would have reduced safeguards for
wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   Bush declined to establish a marine reserve along the Gulf Coast
for the endangered Kemp's ridley sea turtle. But his administration
has stepped up enforcement by state game wardens of laws to protect
the turtles from shrimping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush doesn't really seem to put environmental issues on his
list of priorities, much less high on his list of priorities,''
said Ken Kramer, director of the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra
Club. ``It's the old laissez faire approach to dealing with
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barry McBee, Bush's former conservation commission chairman
and now executive assistant to Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, said the
governor backs full and fair enforcement of environmental laws and
demands solid scientific grounding for decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very quick study,'' McBee said. ``The governor's
record will tell the American people that balanced, reasonable
environmental protection will occur on his watch.'' Perhaps no
issue is more important to Gore than the environment. But he has
been careful so far in the campaign not to overplay his hand. Gore
is a card-carrying environmentalist, having written a 1992
best-seller, ``Earth in the Balance,'' an impassioned plea for
vigorous action to combat global warming, ozone depletion and
species extinction. He has been Clinton's environmental point man,
leading the anti-sprawl initiative, promoting stricter clean-air
standards and rescuing negotiations in Kyoto, Japan, on an
international climate treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president learned the danger of appearing too green in
the late '80s, when he ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic
presidential nomination. Global warming and nuclear arms were
``exotic at best'' to voters, as he put it in his book.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign Web site lists four priorities for ``America in
the 21st Century,'' and the environment is not one of them. The
four are education, faith-based organizations, prosperity and
fighting cancer. Don't expect his campaign rhetoric to include such
zingers as this one from his book: ``We must make the rescue of the
environment the central organizing principle for civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's no doubt the environment is at the top of his
agenda. His anti-sprawl initiative _ Gore likes the term
``livability'' _ seems to be resonating with soccer moms stuck in
traffic and other demographic groups. The vice president is pushing
a multibillion-dollar plan to preserve green space and water
quality, ease traffic congestion, expand mass transit and curb
low-density suburban development.
</P>
<P>
   He recently took the podium to announce the administration's
$7.8 billion plan to restore water flow in the Everglades, a plan
supported by Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, brother of the Texas governor.
That was a delicious political moment for the vice president. Not
only did he get to announce a pet project, but he got to do it with
the backing of someone named Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Some activists have been disappointed that Gore has not done
more to push environmental initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the day Gore was elected vice president, he has sought to
moderate some of the messages in his book and has followed a very
balanced and in some respects disappointing environmental policy,''
said John Echeverria, director of the Environmental Policy Project
at Georgetown University Law Center.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bunch, chief counsel of the Austin-based Save Our Springs
Alliance, said Gore has not been aggressive enough in pushing to
protect endangered species and to set aside ecologically
significant lands. Coming from another perspective, author Gregg
Easterbrook, in his book, ``A Moment on the Earth,'' faults Gore
for dwelling on ``end-of-the-world locutions'' while downplaying
good ecological news. ``Someday even Vice President Gore will smile
when he talks about the ecology,'' Easterbrook wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But most environmentalists regard Gore as a longstanding ally.
Twenty years ago, as a member of the House, he co-sponsored the
Superfund program for cleaning up toxic wastes. Long before global
warming became widely recognized as an issue, he held hearings and
sponsored legislation on the subject. He authored legislation to

</P>
<P>

with environmentalists on 64 percent of key votes.
</P>

 &HT;    Military service issues continues to dog Bush
 &HT;    By Mike Ward and Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ At a time when the Tet Offensive was
dramatically increasing the number of young Americans in combat in
Vietnam, George W. Bush, then a congressman's kid, found a way to
put on a uniform yet stay relatively safe during the unpopular war.
</P>
<P>
   How he managed to do that is a question that has dogged Bush
since he made his first run for public office six years ago, and it
continues as he pursues a front-runner's campaign for the GOP
presidential nomination. Critics have suggested that because he has
a father with position and influence, strings were pulled to help
him get into the National Guard and avoid the draft, though so far
there is no evidence to prove it. Still, records and comments by
Guard officials suggest that Bush wasn't hurt by his pedigree,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that will hurt him with voters come Election Day remains
to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   In the Texas governor's favor is a field of candidates not
well-positioned to assail his military record. The GOP side
includes two other former guardsmen, five who never served, a woman
who had no obligation to serve _ and a decorated ex-POW.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is a fellow that went and flew airplanes and learned to
be a pilot and was prepared to go if he had to,'' said Utah Sen.
Orrin Hatch, a recent entry in the presidential field and a
candidate with no military service. ``That is a lot. You know, I
don't see how anybody can find fault with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain, the only GOP presidential contender
with active-duty military service, has not made a big issue of
Bush's military service. McCain, however, has joked that he slept
more soundly as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam knowing that
Bush was defending Texas from invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Also working for Bush is an electorate seemingly beyond
fascination with war-hero presidents. Bill Clinton, who used
student deferments to avoid military service in a war he did not
support, defeated two World War II veterans, George Bush and Bob
Dole.
</P>
<P>
   But working against Bush is a national press corps that has
drawn a big target on him. Rolling Stone magazine is out this week
with an article that concludes Bush ``skirted the draft with help
from his father.'' The proof? A quote from an unnamed Democratic
Party insider who heard it from someone else. The article is the
latest in a series of national media stories in recent weeks to
focus on Bush's military record.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about Bush's military record have surfaced in
surprising places. Last week, two Dallas lawyers tried to make it
an issue in a civil lawsuit filed by a former Texas Lottery
director. Although the issue of whether Bush got preferential
treatment in the Guard played to no conclusion, the line of
questioning quickly became grist for the Austin political rumor
mill.
</P>
<P>
   In deposing Austin lobbyist Nick Kralj, lawyers for Larry
Littwin, who was removed as lottery chief in October 1997, pressed
for information about former Lt. Gov. Ben Barnes, who was lottery
company Gtech's top lobbyist in Texas until the company bought out
his contract in February 1997. Littwin's lawyers asked whether
Barnes had interceded in 1968 to get Bush into the Texas Air
National Guard. Kralj worked as Barnes' top aide in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Litwin, who is suing the Lottery Commission over
his firing, said they were trying to gauge how much political clout
Democrat Barnes might have had with Republican Bush, whose
appointees made up a majority of the Lottery Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are attempting to chase down all the rabbit trails for how
Gtech might have had some influence'' over the commission, said
Rich Aubin, one of Littwin's lawyers. ``Certainly if Ben Barnes had
done a favor for George Bush 30 years ago, that might provide some
potential influence.'' Aubin said Kralj ``confirmed there was a
practice wherein he would be given a list of names'' by Barnes to
be forwarded to the late Brig. Gen. James M. Rose, head of the
Texas Air National Guard when Bush served. ``And then one way or
another those people would end up in the Guard,'' Aubin said Kralj
testified.
</P>
<P>
   But Kralj also testified he did not remember any names on the
lists, the attorneys said. Barnes has since told The Associated
Press that he did not intercede for Bush. For his part, Bush has
defended his six years in the Air National Guard as earned and
honorable _ the same thing he's been doing since it first surfaced
as an issue in his 1994 gubernatorial campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not suggesting I was any great war hero,'' Bush said
during that campaign. ``But I want you to know that flying F-102
fighters, putting the thing in afterburner at the end of a runway,
was something other than not being a part of the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't necessarily call it risky duty, but we lost a
couple of guys in our unit. I'm not the least bit ashamed of what I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   AN ATTRACTIVE OPTION
</P>
<P>
   Bush's military career began in 1968, as he finished his final
semester at Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   With his deferments ending and the Vietnam War escalating as the
North Vietnamese launched the bloody Tet Offensive, Bush, like most
other draft-age American men, faced the prospect of going to
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The Guard offered an appealing alternative: Fulfill your
military service obligation, probably stateside. Nationally, the
waiting lists contained more than 100,000 names.
</P>
<P>
   But the Texas Air National Guard, in which Bush enlisted in May
1968, had openings _ 156 among its authorized staffing level of
925.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his choice was motivated more by career interest than
avoidance. ``I knew I was going into the military and would have
liked to come out with a skill,'' Bush said recently. ``Your
options were either to avoid the draft or sign up, and I signed
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard records show that soon after Bush met in Houston with Col.
Walter ``Buck'' Staudt, then the commander of the Texas Air
National Guard, he was immediately accepted as a pilot trainee. He
had passed a screening exam to be a military pilot several months
earlier at a recruiting office near the Yale campus. With no
aviation background or schooling, he might have seemed like an
unlikely candidate _ his Guard application form listed jobs such as
messenger, ranch hand, oilfield roustabout, Sears sporting goods
salesman and bookkeeper. Asked for ``background qualifications of
value to the Air Force,'' Bush wrote, ``None.''
</P>
<P>
   But he scored in the top 5 percent in the ``officer quality''
section of his enlistment test _ a section designed to measure
intangible things such as leadership. His score in the pilot
aptitude section was much lower, in the 25th percentile, the lowest
allowed for wannabe fliers, records show.
</P>
<P>
   He was physically and educationally qualified and was willing to
undergo the lengthy and rigorous pilot training _ something some
enlistees were not.
</P>
<P>
   ``A quiet, intelligent young man who has the interest,
motivation and knowledge necessary to become a commissioned
officer,'' Staudt wrote in a report on his first meeting with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   By early June, he was a member of the 147th Fighter Interceptor
Group, part of the so-called ``Ace in the Hole'' squadron based at
Ellington Air Force Base outside Houston, Bush's hometown. The unit
flew F-102s, an older model of jet that was being phased out of the
regular Air Force but was still seeing duty in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   DRIVEN BY POLITICS
</P>
<P>
   Would Bush have advanced in rank so quickly, would he have been
able to land a coveted pilot's job, if not for his name? Guard
records give no indication of that, though official press releases
frequently played up Bush's famous father, whose adventures as a
Navy pilot in World War II made him a war hero.
</P>
<P>
   Five or six pilot jobs were open at the time, and Bush got one
because he was qualified, Guard officials have said. Indeed, his
performance reports gave glowing evaluations of his work, which
consisted of flying ``alerts'' over the Gulf of Mexico _ military
jargon for guarding the border against enemy attack.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush was promoted to first lieutenant in November 1970, his
Guard review called him ``a natural leader whom his contemporaries
look to for leadership. Lt. Bush is also a good follower with
outstanding disciplinary traits and an impeccable military bearing.
. . . (He) possesses vast potential and should be promoted well
ahead of his contemporaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as his family had been driven by politics, so was Bush's
military career. In late 1972, he asked for _ and received _ a
three-month transfer to the Alabama Air Guard so he could work on a
Republican candidate's Senate campaign _ even though the Alabama
unit was being phased out.
</P>
<P>
   Guard officials said such a transfer was not unusual, and the
Bush campaign says it was for the same flying job he held in Texas
_ but it gave him the opportunity to pursue his civilian job of
political work. A May 1973 job evaluation, however, reported he had
been ``performing equivalent training in a non-flying status.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush was required to serve in the Guard until May 1974,
he was allowed to leave in October 1973 to attend Harvard Business
School.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing unusual, Guard officials have said, since his unit was
changing planes at the time _ from single-seat F-102 jets to the
dual-seat F-101s. With just eight months of service left, they
said, it made little sense to retrain Bush.
</P>
<P>
   NOT YET A PUBLIC ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   So far, if Bush's military record has drawn media attention, it
is the only candidate's record to do so. Political observers say
the public has shown little interest so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a very big issue. Obviously, the farther
away we get from Vietnam the more the issue fades,'' said Stephen
Hess, a longtime presidential politics analyst at the
Washington-based Brookings Institution. ``I think it would be
somewhat mitigated by the fact that the man became a fighter pilot.
It's not as if he was sitting at a typewriter at Fort Leonard Wood.
It just doesn't strike me that this one is going to stick to the
ribs.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Dan Quayle, 52, has said questions raised during
the 1988 presidential campaign about his service in the Indiana
National Guard may spare Bush the same intense media scrutiny this
time around. ``The bottom line is this: Were any rules broken, was
there favoritism?'' Quayle said earlier this month. ``If there was
favoritism, then that's wrong. If there was special treatment,
that's wrong. If there were rules that were violated, then that's
clearly wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Begala, a former adviser to President Clinton, said Friday
that few people will believe Bush didn't get a family nudge into
the Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm willing to accept his argument that neither he nor his
father pulled any strings,'' said Begala, a Gore backer. ``What I
have a hard time believing is when he says he didn't receive . . .
preferential treatment. He was a Bush and a son of a Bush. And he
was jumped ahead of everyone else on the waiting list.''
</P>
<P>
   Begala said he doesn't perceive any voter animosity to
politicians who served in the Guard rather than active-duty
military. He said the only way the issue could hurt Bush is if
voters believe he is not being straight with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why doesn't he just say, `It sure looks like they gave me a
chance to serve ahead of others. I couldn't control that and I
didn't ask for that,'?'' Begala said.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters in recent years have mostly ignored the issue of
presidential candidates' military service. But when asked about it
in 1988, 63 percent of Americans did not have a less favorable view
of a candidate with no military service, while 32 percent did,
according to the Pew Research Center in Washington, a source of
independent polling data.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Kalb, a longtime TV network correspondent who directs
Harvard University's Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics
and Public Policy, sees a simmering issue that could hit the
campaign-trail boiling point down the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't fire in the electorate right now for presidential
politics,'' he said. ``But the merits of this issue will have long
legs, and undoubtedly the issue will come up again when people are
more focused on the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people will think he got a break and that he got a
break because he was the son of a congressman from the area,'' he
said. ``And I think they think unkindly about that.''

TALKS FAIL TO END MEXICO UNIVERSITY STRIKE

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Talks between striking students and authorities
from Mexico's largest university aimed at settling an 88-day-old
shutdown have collapsed, making the possibility of police action to
open the campus more real.
</P>
<P>
   In a tense session Friday, administration representatives from
the National Autonomous University of Mexico, known as UNAM, said
they would agree to further discussions on the strikers' demands
only after the students end their occupation of the vast campus in
southern Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The strikers refused to turn over the campus, which they have
closed with barricades and student patrols at all entrances, until
the authorities agreed to all of their demands, including the
elimination of all payments, including laboratory and computer
fees, and the relaxation of academic standards, which have been
tightened in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that the public and a majority of the 270,000
students at UNAM are opposed to the strike but do not favor the use
of force to end it.

 &HT;    Poor handling of hazardous hospital waste worries officials
 &HT;    By Dale Dempsey and Cathy Mong
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ During a routine inspection of a truck hauling
trash this month, workers at BFI's recycling transfer station
outside of Cincinnati discovered what looked like blood coming from
one of the bags.
</P>
<P>
   They found that some of the bags contained hazardous medical
wastes _ bloody gauze, surgical gowns and other operating room
equipment _ from Middletown Regional Hospital. Such hazardous
material is prohibited by federal environmental laws from mixing
with ordinary waste.
</P>
<P>
   When on July 8 biomedical wastes were found a second time, it
prompted a review by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and
the Middletown Health Department of the Middletown hospital's waste
handling, a crucial procedure that a recent study says needs to be
improved at many hospitals around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Middletown hospital responded quickly to clean up the hazardous
waste, but the incidents raised concerns among environmental
officials because hospitals use a wide range of materials that can
contaminate the environment. In addition to potentially infectious
materials, there are pollutants such as mercury in thermometers and
blood pressure devices, and polyvinyl chloride plastic in IV drip
bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``They definitely did good work at the transfer station in
spotting this stuff,'' said Lynne Barst of the Ohio EPA.
</P>
<P>
   Hazardous medical wastes are required to be placed in special
red bags that carry a warning and disposed of in special landfills
or by incineration. Some of the waste found at BFI was in ordinary
bags. Disposing of ``red bag'' waste can cost two to three times
more than regular waste.
</P>
<P>
   Middletown hospital is opening and inspecting all of the trash
that leaves the building and is reviewing its systems and
procedures, according to Larry James, vice-president of marketing
at the hospital. The Miamisburg health department also made a
partial inspection.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very, very serious incident for us,'' James said.
``We're doing everything to make sure that it doesn't happen
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Staff education about proper disposal is also ``going on with
even greater emphasis,'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   Education is also one of the key recommendations of a survey of
50 major U.S. hospitals conducted last year by the Environmental
Working Group in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that lack of basic environmental practices at
hospitals is resulting in serious pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
   Among its findings were:
</P>
<P>
   _ The average hospital is recycling only approximately one-third
of the readily recyclable items. Some hospitals recycle none.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only 20 percent of the hospitals surveyed had programs to
reduce purchases of polyvinyl chloride plastic. PVC plastic is a
major factor in emissions of the carcinogen dioxin when waste is
incinerated.
</P>
<P>
   _ While 80 percent of the hospitals have mercury reduction
programs, the programs are not particularly effective.

FOLLOWING MONEY FOR THE AMERICA'S CUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1992, shortly after winning the right to challenge the United
States for the America's Cup, Italy could not get enough of the
American Paul Cayard. But now the Italians have a new focus, new
money and a new skipper. And no one knows that better than Cayard,
a mostly forgotten yachtsman in Italy these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably truthful that whoever is going to win the cup
this next time is the team with the most money to optimize boat
design,'' Cayard said in a recent telephone interview from San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Italians who have that money. It's a worry, because
they will be the ones who can afford the incremental tidbits that
can make the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Cayard has organized his own America's Cup campaign for the
1999-2000 event under the aegis of the St. Francis Yacht Club in
San Francisco. The team was preparing last week to christen the
first of its two new 75-foot sailboats. The ceremony was scheduled
for Saturday at the group's summer training base in San Pedro,
Calif. Both yachts, designed by Bruce Nelson of San Diego, will be
shipped to New Zealand by the end of August.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard's group, America One, has probably as good a chance as
any of the five U.S. teams to win the America's Cup from New
Zealand. But first there are the Italians. Their yachting syndicate
is organized by Prada, the Italian apparel designer and
manufacturer. Petrizio Bertelli, Prada's director, is chairman of
the yachting syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   Flush with financial support from Prada, the group has hired top
sailors and designers, including two Olympic champions, Francesco
de Angelis, the Italian helmsman, and Torben Grael of Brazil,
tactician. Other insiders include Laurent Esquier and Steve
Erickson, both important members of Cayard's boat-building team
until the Italians lured them away with bigger salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old Cayard tends to be far more philosophical since
sailing for an Italian group that made it to the America's Cup
finals in 1992. He competed that year as yacht skipper for Italy's
Il Moro di Venezia syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   Money flowed into the America's Cup effort with the help of the
late Raul Gardini, who was syndicate chairman. The financier, a
prominent Italian businessman, spent somewhere between $60 and $100
million _ reports varied widely _ in his effort to win the cup.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't enough to thwart the equally determined and
comparably wealthy Bill Koch, the America3 financier, who
eventually prevailed against the Gardini-Cayard bid. After losing
to Koch, Gardini went back to Italy where he faced potential
government bribery charges. In the midst of the political turmoil,
Gardini shot himself.
</P>
<P>
   For Cayard, who had seen Gardini as a father-figure, it was a
personal tragedy. Aimless as he faced a five-year wait for the next
scheduled America's Cup regatta, Cayard immersed himself in a
victorious Swedish-backed campaign in the 1997-98 Whitbread Round
the World Race.
</P>
<P>
   Gardini's death marked the end of a gilded era in yacht racing
for Cayard. But the Whitbread provided a chance for personal
triumph on his own terms. His team included mostly hand-picked
sailors from his cup years, and they learned on the job about the
humility, tenacity, terror and the conquest of sailing a 60-foot
yacht round the world. For Cayard, it was a crash course in
self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the benefit of Gardini, but that was not really
reality,'' Cayard said about the 1992 cup year. ``Reality is
earning your keep, and making this thing valuable to others,
especially corporate sponsors. From a time standpoint _ and the
fact that the America's Cup is a hard sell _ it adds a lot of
pressure to being skipper. It is a very first-person thing, and
very time-consuming.''
</P>
<P>
   Cayard's America One budget is a hefty $32 million. But he has
significant financial backers already in place _ including
Hewlett-Packard, Ford Motor Co. and Science Applications
International Corp., a technology firm based in California. He
needs $8 million more.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to strike a balance between fund raising and
racing, and no one knows that better than Dennis Conner. The
veteran cup helmsman increasingly finds other sailors to steer his
boat while he is raising money. He has named Ken Read, a two-time
Rolex Yachtsman of the Year, to steer for the 1999 challenger
trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a battle out there trying to sell the America's Cup,''
said Bill Trenkle, project manager for Conner. ``You're competing
with every other sport out there. Paul has a new appreciation for
what it takes.''

RETAIL POLITICS  
 STATE-SPECIFIC POLL RESULTS  
 DEMOCRATS EYE KASICH DISTRICT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.H., Iowa, Minn., Ariz., Tenn., Ohio)  (mk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Retail politics.
</P>
<P>
   That's the first thing New Hampshirites mention when they argue
that their state, more than any other, deserves the right to hold
the nation's first presidential primary. And the same is true of
Iowans when they contend that their state should always hold the
first presidential caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   By ``retail,'' these proud New Englanders and Midwesterners mean
old-fashioned politicking in which candidates get down on the
ground and meet and greet voters personally in their homes, in
coffee shops and at small rallies. The impersonal ``air game'' of
flashy television advertising that dominates campaigns in most
other states, the argument goes, does not work in compact, folksy,
down-to-earth New Hampshire and Iowa. Politicking in those two
states, it is said, is like politicking used to be _ and still
should be.
</P>
<P>
   So far, most candidates buy that argument, or at least go along
with it.
</P>
<P>
   But is retail really retail?
</P>
<P>
   The answer seems to be yes and yes _ that is, retail politics in
a political sense really does bring unusually large numbers of
candidates and voters face to face, as in clerk and customer; and
in the classic retail sense, or business sense, in that it pumps
money, big money, into the economy.
</P>
<P>
   A survey commissioned by the Library and Archives of New
Hampshire's Political Tradition found that in the 1996 presidential
campaign, retail politicking resulted in one of every five New
Hampshire voters personally meeting at least one candidate, and
often more. By contrast, in a state like California, the average
voter can go the better part of a lifetime, if not an entire
lifetime, without meeting a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the study found that all the running around, eating,
advertising and renting of rooms, cars, auditoriums and workspace
by candidates, political consultants and reporters, created 1,500
temporary jobs and pumped over $210 million into the New Hampshire
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our answer for why New Hampshire works,'' former Gov.
Hugh Gregg, the chairman of the Library and Archives organization,
said in releasing the study.
</P>
<P>
   The study, based on a survey of travel, business, tax and
Federal Election Commission data, along with interviews with
campaign workers and media specialists, also concluded that the New
Hampshire primary offered the state a huge opportunity to promote
itself at no cost because of the press coverage given the
quadrennial event. The state received over 20,000 media mentions in
1996, the study said, going on to estimate that they were read,
heard or seen by upwards of 150 million people around the country.
</P>
<P>
   But if the promotion opportunity is to be fully exploited, the
study added, the state needs to impress visiting reporters that
more New Hampshirites hold high-technology jobs these days than
milk cows and wear flannel shirts.
</P>
<P>
   In a Swift Campaign, Some Fast Polls, Too
</P>
<P>
   It is still early in the Election 2000 nominating game, but in
the for-what-it's-worth department, here are the results of some
polls taken in various states in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota: According to a survey conducted last weekend by the
independent Mason-Dixon polling organization of Maryland, four of
every five voters do not want Gov. Jesse Ventura to run for
president.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, whose surprise victory in last fall's election
made him the most successful Reform Party candidate ever, has said
repeatedly that he has no designs on the White House. And, in fact,
he is urging former Gov. Lowell Weicker of Connecticut, a
Republican-turned-independent, to run for the Reform nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But because Ventura is also calling for reform of the Reform
Party _ he asserts that Ross Perot's time has passed _ there is a
steady undercurrent of talk that ultimately, whatever the wishes of
Minnesota voters, he intends to seek the nomination for himself.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Reform Party holds its annual convention in
Dearborn, Mich., next weekend, there could be a tussle worth
watching between the governor, a strutting former professional
wrestler, and the bantam billionaire Texan, one of the richest and
fastest tongues in the West.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire: Good news for Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Because
he is the only Republican candidate not competing in Iowa's straw
poll on Aug. 14, perhaps the biggest political event of 1999, and
because he has indicated that he will not compete next year in
Iowa's pivotal first-in-the-nation caucuses, New Hampshire's
first-in-the-nation primary looms as the first big test for him.
And he is working the state hard.
</P>
<P>
   How's he doing?
</P>
<P>
   For months he was bumping along near the bottom in most polls,
badly trailing both Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the runaway
leader, and the No. 2 contender, Elizabeth Dole, the former Red
Cross president. Now comes a new poll conducted by an independent
New Hampshire polling company, the American Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is still the runaway leader, still ahead of the
second-place finisher by almost 3-1. But that second-place finisher
is now McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole has slipped to fourth, behind Patrick Buchanan, the
commentator and winner of the 1996 New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona: Bad news for McCain in the latest poll from his home
state, which also holds an early primary, one in which he obviously
must shine.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who trailed McCain in earlier Arizona polls, has now
pulled ahead and leads the senator almost 2-1, according to a
survey conducted last weekend by an independent polling group, the
Rocky Mountain Behavior Research Center of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee: Really bad news in the latest poll from the home
state of another Republican contender, former Gov. Lamar Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   He is already on the political ropes, down to just $90,000 in
campaign cash and betting everything on next month's straw poll in
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   And now comes news that when the West Knoxville Republican Club
held a straw poll last Monday (members say it was not announced in
advance), he drew just one of the 64 votes cast, the political
equivalent of drawing the last straw, given that Bush got 51 votes
and West Knoxville lies just 20 miles north of Alexander's
hometown, Maryville.
</P>
<P>
   A `Safe' GOP Seat? Democrats Lining Up
</P>
<P>
   When Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, abandoned his quest for the
Republican presidential nomination last week, he made life easier
for all those Republican leaders who are promoting George W. Bush
as the party's best hope in Election 2000. But Kasich left them
with a problem when he also announced that after nine terms, he
planned to give up representing Ohio's 12th District in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Add another ``safe'' Republican seat to the ``open seat'' list,
the category for seats most vulnerable to takeover by the other
party.
</P>
<P>
   Having controlled the 12th, which covers major parts of
Columbus, for 17 years, Republicans probably still have a better
shot at it than Democrats in Election 2000. But President Clinton
carried it in 1996 and only barely lost it in 1992, and so
Democrats see the district as one that, with a bit of luck, could
help them narrow the six-seat edge Republicans currently hold in
the House.
</P>
<P>
   Two Republicans, state Sen. Eugene Watts and state Rep. Pat
Tiberi, a former Kasich aide, have announced and are out raising
money. On the Democratic side, at least half a dozen party figures
have expressed interest in running, among them a local county
chairman, several state legislators, a city attorney and a member
of the city council.

GO SLOW ON TAX CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, July 18:
</P>
<P>
   Cutting taxes always sounds good in Washington, and it may be
inevitable that Congress will pass a tax cut before next year's
election. But if that is to happen, the grandiose cutting plans
proposed by the chairmen of the congressional tax-writing
committees need to be scaled back substantially.
</P>
<P>
   Economically, this is an inappropriate time for any tax
decrease. With the economy booming and the Federal Reserve raising
interest rates in an effort to slow growth and prevent inflation, a
fiscal stimulus package would have the opposite effect, and could
persuade the Federal Reserve that it will need to raise interest
rates more than would otherwise be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important defect of the plans by Rep. Bill Archer,
the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and Sen. William
Roth, the chairman of the Finance Committee, lies in their sheer
scope. Rather than simply pass a tax cut that would take effect in
the next year or two, both Republican bills call for major cuts to
be made well into the next decade. The Archer bill even has cuts to
take effect in 2009, three presidential elections from now.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's bill, as passed by his committee on a party-line vote,
is expected to cut government revenue by $864 billion over the next
10 years, and by much more in years after that as some major
provisions _ including a repeal of all estate taxes, even for
billionaires _ are phased in. The Roth bill calls for cuts of $792
billion over the 10 years. A more moderate plan from Senate
Democrats led by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan proposes cuts of $295
billion, still more than the $250 billion President Clinton has
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican proposals are based on estimates that the
government will otherwise run huge surpluses in coming years. But
those estimates are inherently questionable, and the surpluses
could vanish if the economy were to weaken. In addition, the
surplus figures are based on the assumption that spending will be
held down in accord with previous budget compromises, even though
it appears likely that this Congress will be unable to abide by the
harsh spending cuts required to meet those targets. Congress should
first pass its spending bills and only then turn to the issue of
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   If there are to be tax cuts, they should be targeted at middle-
and lower-income taxpayers. While some adjustments to estate taxes
may be in order, Archer's plan to eliminate the tax is a giveaway
to the wealthy that would severely damage the government's finances
after it took effect in 2009. Similarly, there is no reason to
further cut capital gains taxes, as Archer proposes.
</P>
<P>
   Any bill that is passed should target the abusive tax shelters
used by some companies to avoid paying taxes. The Republicans say
they are still studying Clinton administration proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, a tax bill should not have provisions that would
decimate government revenues five or 10 years from now. If the
present optimistic economic forecasts prove to be accurate, there
will be more than enough time for a future Congress to consider
those reductions.

<P>
   BAYONNE, N.J. _ As the crowd of hundreds chanted ``Make them
bleed! Make them bleed!'' Frank Iadavaia raised the metal garbage
can above his head and heaved it into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   It bounced on the canvas, spilling crutches, wooden canes and
frying pans provided by the fans in the furtherance of mayhem,
across the mat. Then Iadavaia led a dozen wrestlers over the ropes
and started whacking anything, and anyone, that moved.
</P>
<P>
   The battle might have seemed like a sporting event gone horribly
wrong. But as evenings go for Jersey All-Pro Wrestling, one of the
scores of independent wrestling federations that have blossomed
across the country in the last five years, it was run of the mill.
</P>
<P>
   Steeped in blood, these tiny leagues have seized upon a hunger
among their fans for increased realism and violence in professional
wrestling _ for a real-life urgency that their larger counterparts,
the World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling,
cannot supply.
</P>
<P>
   But is it fake? Well, sort of. It has long been one of
professional wrestling's canards that matches are scripted, lacking
even the slightest spontaneous move. While that is mostly true for
the larger leagues, which plan everything for television and do not
pretend that the pain they portray is real, the smaller leagues,
which operate outside the media's eye, are somewhat looser when it
comes to blood.
</P>
<P>
   Though wrestlers at Jersey All-Pro Wrestling and other, similar,
leagues do plan most of their matches in advance, the techniques
they use are more dangerous than those in the big leagues, and are
designed to meet an expectation in the crowd that actual beatings
will occur. Some of the pain and blood is fake. Some is quite real.
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, is the point.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows for sure how many independent leagues like Jersey
All-Pro Wrestling exist throughout the country. The small outfits,
which are often no more than a promoter and his stable of
wrestlers, have no governing body, and promoters and newsletter
writers who follow the sport say there are so many new federations
popping up each month that it would be impossible to count them
all.
</P>
<P>
   Jersey All-Pro, which began in this blue-collar enclave, is a
typical example of an independent league, and Iadavaia, a Bayonne
native who wrestles under the name Lightning Lou Diamond, embodies
the passions that characterize it.
</P>
<P>
   A thick-waisted, ebullient man of 26, he founded Jersey All-Pro
in 1995 while working as an administrative clerk by day and manager
of an auto body shop at night. Though he said his first shows were
depressing failures _ no more than a dozen fans showed up _ he
found what he needed to draw in the fans when he discovered
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doing all kinds of things back then to bring in the
fans,'' he said. ``I put chairs by the ropes and did 360s into the
crowd. Then I happened to pick up a chair and whacked somebody with
it and the roof blew off the place. Right there is where I decided.
I just told everyone, `Let's go out and bleed.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jersey All-Pro is one of the bloodier independent leagues. Its
wrestlers grapple inside wire cages or on mats strewn with tacks.
It is also one of the more sexually provocative leagues,
occasionally promoting matches in which women wrestle wearing only
string bikinis.
</P>
<P>
   A regular feature is what Iadavaia calls a ``weapons match.'' As
the spectators paid their $10 and filed into Charity Hall, they
brought along a staggering array of clubs and bludgeons and put
them in the ring for the fighters to use once they entered: hockey
sticks, baseball bats, even a kitchen sink.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Jersey All-Pro's wrestlers are local men, guys from
Bayonne and the nearby communities who think of match night as a
chance to perform in front of neighbors and friends. While they say
there is a certain pleasure in getting paid to swing a frying pan _
most make $40 to $100 a night _ many say the bouts are a way to
rise above their workaday lives and bask in acclaim they would
never otherwise enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   With its motto, ``Blood is better,'' and the occasional but very
real injuries that occur in the ring, Jersey All-Pro walks a line
between the mainstream wrestling leagues and ``ultimate'' or
``extreme fighting'' events, the no-holds-barred competitions
blending martial arts, wrestling and common street brawling.
</P>
<P>
   While Jersey All-Pro's wrestlers have suffered an array of
bumps, cuts, bruises and broken bones over the years, none of them
have been killed or seriously injured _ yet.

WAY WEST ON 14TH STREET: CHANGING FROM A PLACE FOR MEAT TO A PLACE
TO MEET 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The contrast could hardly be more stark. There in the
city's traditional meat-packing district on 14th Street between
Ninth and Tenth avenues, art galleries, trendy restaurants and
stores are mingling with men in bloody aprons.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast signals that another industrial neighborhood in
Manhattan is in the process of being transformed by the inexorable
spread of white-collar businesses, just as the printers of Hudson
Square are being ousted by new media companies and warehouses on
the West Side are becoming offices and residences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the meat-packing companies will be moving to the Hunts
Point area over the next few years,'' said David Gmach, executive
director of the 14th Street-Union Square Business Improvement
District and Local Development Corp., who noted that much of
Manhattan's fish market was headed toward the same location.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Gmach said, a total of about 10 galleries have moved
into the area, which has among its advantages a proximity to the
Hudson River and the prospect that a riverside park will be built
at some point in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The street also has an outpost of the Little Pie Co. and Dizzy
Izzy's, which one resident described as ``a bagel place and
cultural center.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new commercial tenants said they were attracted by
more affordable space and the willingness of their customers to
travel to parts of city once considered off limits to middle-class
shoppers. ``Collectors like that kind of thing, digging around in
odd parts of the city,'' said Susan B. Anthony, a broker with her
own agency that specializes in gallery relocations.
</P>
<P>
   The other reason for the increase in activity is that there was
almost no other place to go in Manhattan. ``We really have had a
hard time finding space in Chelsea,'' she said. ``We had to look
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on 57th Street along with Bugs Bunny,'' said Stephen
Long, the owner of Long Fine Art, referring to the Warner Brothers
Studio Store that occupies a Fifth Avenue corner on that street. He
moved to a converted meat storage building in February 1998 to save
on rent and to stand out a bit more with ground-floor space than
was possible on an upstairs floor of a building in midtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first summer I was here was a little frightening,'' he
said. ``All my veggie friends said they would do business by
phone.'' But he said customers have followed him to the new
location and special events like the Meat Market Crawl, when
galleries stay open late one night a month, have drawn in shoppers
not familiar with the area.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage of the area, he said, was that the low-rise
buildings nearby provided plenty of natural light for the gallery.
And he said the schedule of the meat business actually helped to
make the area more secure than might be expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meat packers start about midnight and work through the
morning, which makes this a 24-hour neighborhood,'' Long said.
``Artists who live in the area say it is very secure.''
</P>
<P>
   The development of West 14th Street appears to echo what
happened previously in the western part of Chelsea in the 20s,
where gallery owners being driven out of SoHo by rising rents paid
by retailers eager to set up shop in a heavily trafficked area
converted old garage buildings that had formerly served the garment
district into galleries.
</P>
<P>
   One SoHo refugee is Hal Katzen of the Katzen-Stein gallery a few
doors east of Long's establishment. ``My space in SoHo on West
Broadway was sold, so I had to find a new space.'' He said he has
been in his 14th Street space for a year and finds it satisfactory
``There is a rawness to the area, but my clients are making their
way over here,'' he said. ``It reminds me of the old SoHo in the
1970s.''

</P>
<P>
   Just about everyone concedes that the traffic on the congested
cobblestoned street is a problem, with huge tractor-trailer trucks
attempting to maneuver in spaces laid out when the biggest vehicle
was a horse-drawn wagon. Most trucks cannot back directly up to the
places where they are making deliveries, but must position
themselves at an angle to the building, restricting traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The general hope among the newer tenants in the area is that as
the meat industry relocates, the big trucks will follow.
</P>
<P>
   Farther to the west, in an old warehouse next to Moishe's Mini
Storage, a new, 12,000-square-foot retail store, to be called
Jeffrey, is under construction.
</P>
<P>
   The proprietor, Jeffrey Kalinsky, plans to open the store on
August 2, on his 37th birthday, which seemed like an ambitious goal
given the state of construction just a few weeks before that date.
The store is expected to be stocked with clothing and shoes with
brand names like Gucci, Helmut Lang, Jil Sander and Prada.
</P>
<P>
   Kalinsky, who was formerly the women's shoe buyer for Barneys,
said he thinks the location is a good one for a store selling
upscale products, despite its distance from the main shopping
districts on Madison and Fifth avenues, 57th Street and SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this neighborhood and the structure is beautiful,''
said Kalinsky, who operates three stores in Atlanta but who has not
tested the New York market on his own before.
</P>
<P>
   One of the advantages of the area is low rent, which brokers put
in the $23 to $26-a-square-foot-a-year range, compared to hundreds
of dollars a square foot in some of the more established retail
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeffrey made his deal eight months ago and already it's
undervalued due to growing attention to the neighborhood,'' said
Caroline Banker, a broker with New Spectrum Realty Services.
``Landlords in the area are already asking $35 a foot for
ground-floor space.''
</P>
<P>
   She said residential development in the area and the decision by
a retailer like Comme des Garcons to open a store on 22nd Street
between 10th and 11th avenues would help make the area a
destination for shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Kalinsky expects to expand his operation as the ministorage
winds down _ he and his broker, Ms. Anthony, say that the
mini-storage operation is expected to be converted to retail use _
and is planning to eventually occupy 92,000 square feet, said Ms.
Banker, who noted that the store's proximity to the West Side
Highway may make it attractive to suburban shoppers as well.
</P>
<P>
   But others were more skeptical about the location. ``It is out
of the way, and who has time to shop anyway,'' said Faith H.
Consolo, a senior managing director of Garrick-Aug Associates,
another brokerage specializing in retail leasing. ``He's going to
have to cater to the `ladies who lunch' and hope they will go
there.''
</P>
<P>
   One place those hungry ladies will be able to stop in at is
Markt, a restaurant at 14th Street and Ninth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Michaels, who opened the restaurant about six months ago,
said he was ``lucky on the timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live in the neighborhood and I saw Chelsea moving down and
the West Village moving up and meeting here.'' He said other
restaurants were open or planning to open in the area, including Le
Gans on Gansevoort Street and Balthazar on West 12th Street. In
addition, he said it is widely believed in the neighborhood that a
hotel will be built on a parking lot a few blocks to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly people are moving to the area and paying hefty prices
to do so. Several old industrial buildings at 345 W. 13th Street
have been converted into 46 luxury condominiums. Recently a
two-bedroom loft sold for over $2 million and the largest unit is
expected to fetch close to $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Just to the east, on the southwest corner of 14th Street and
Eighth Avenue, a landmarked former bank and an adjoining structure
are also being converted into upscale housing.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents fear that the area may go the way of SoHo, with
early pioneers being driven out as national retailers rush in and
offer higher rents to be in a fashionable area.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Jeffrey is successful, you know other retailers will try to
move in here, just as they have done in other parts of Manhattan,''
Michaels said. ``If a Gap opens up nearby, I'm going to put the
restaurant up for sale.''

REPORTERS DESCEND ON KENNEDY'S NEW YORK NEIGHBORHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (With KENNEDY-MISSING-PLANE)  
(lh) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The normally quiet TriBeCa neighborhood that is home
to John F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy,
turned into a media jungle Saturday afternoon, as police guarded
the building where the couple live and reporters stationed
themselves outside, searching for people who knew the Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the blue police sawhorses, two bouquets of flowers lay on
the gray iron steps leading to the doorway of the apartment
building at 20 North Moore St., a gritty 10-floor industrial
structure whose top floor is occupied by the Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is a popular and oft-noticed personality in the
neighborhood, a celebrity who makes frequent stops at his favorite
breakfast place, Bubby's, and the magazine shop and grocery store
around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   At least twice a week, Kennedy, 38, orders his usual breakfast
of oatmeal and cafe latte at Bubby's, a restaurant on the corner of
Hudson and North Moore streets that lures more than its share of
celebrity regulars, including actors Robert DeNiro and Harvey
Keitel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always asking questions about the kids or how the
business was going,'' said Seth Price, 35, a co-owner of Bubby's
who became friends with Kennedy over the course of nine years. ``He
was born into this family that is like royalty in the United
States, but he was really a human being. You meet a lot of
celebrities in this business,'' Price said, ``and many of them
believe in their own hype. John wasn't like that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   During his days as a Manhattan assistant district attorney,
Kennedy would often show up for breakfast in business suits, Price
said. Other days, he would show up in shorts and tennis shoes
during a break in a day of errands.
</P>
<P>
   One block away, at the Hudson Market, owner Talsun Yi said
Kennedy was always running in to buy coffee, a newspaper or some
fruit. ``He always bought the 50-cent coffee,'' Mrs. Yi, 70, said.
``He was such a nice man. He always came in looking like he was
jogging, wearing clothes that were not so nice. Shoes were not
new,'' she said. ``I always said, John F. Kennedy, he's so rich,
but he always acted the same as you or me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy attended the New York Yankees' game at Yankee Stadium on
Thursday night, sitting near the home dugout, and it did not escape
the notice of the players that Kennedy stayed to watch the entire
game. Some players, David Cone among them, greeted Kennedy briefly,
and after the game, Kennedy departed the stands through the tunnels
of Yankee Stadium, escorted by security.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre had noticed all the attention focused on a
nearby fan during the game, but hadn't realized until later who the
fan was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see him,'' Torre said. ``After the game, my niece
said, `Wow, it was neat seeing him,' and I was like, `Oh, that's
who that was.' What a tragedy. If that doesn't tell you to enjoy
every day, I don't know what does.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees asked for silence before Saturday's game, with the
announcer Bob Sheppard mentioning the uncertainty of Kennedy's
whereabouts, and asking fans to think about the Kennedy family for
a few moments.

 &HT;    From the sidelines to the game
 &HT;    By Mary Schulken
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Her glove was meticulously broken in, prepared for use by
wrapping its pocket around a ball, dampening the leather and
leaving it to dry.
</P>
<P>
   Her knees were scabbed as mercilessly as any boy's, scrape upon
scrape earned running down grounders that threatened to slip
between second and third.
</P>
<P>
   Her swing put her on base more times than not.
</P>
<P>
   But when the team took the field, she sat on the sidelines. She
could play, but she couldn't suit up.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the memories of a generation of women. Forty-something
and fifty-something women who once stuffed pigtails inside ball
caps for practice games with brothers and who bought striped
uniforms at the dime store with their allowances. Women who
perfected lay-ups on hoops nailed to barn walls. Women whose
bat-broadened shoulders now bear briefcases, whose muscled arms
lift kids and groceries, and whose knees ? well, whose knees don't
look good in short skirts.
</P>
<P>
   Those memories of the sidelines mingle, bittersweet, with the
images of national adulation for a victorious U.S. women's soccer
team. They are baggage from the days when boys played ball and
girls cheered them on. The days before Title IX, before we as a
nation said women deserve a playing field in high school and
college.
</P>
<P>
   Like other winners, the women's soccer team has captured the
respect and imagination of a culture that attaches enormous
significance to athletic accomplishments. Yet this particular
snapshot of success _ this picture of a nation celebrating talented
and unabashedly competitive women _ takes on a very personal
meaning for those who want to get in the game.
</P>
<P>
   All of us have crazy things, wild things we hold inside our
heart that we want to see. Things that have taken on an almost
unexplained meaning.
</P>
<P>
   For me, it's seeing a woman in a major league uniform. Pitching.
Hitting. Stopping grounders and making a neat toss to second, or a
bullet throw to first for the out.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be me. But I want to see it. I can't really say why,
but it thrills me to think about it.
</P>
<P>
   I don't believe those who say it will never happen. I especially
don't believe them now, while the world claps its hands in glee
over women who can both kick the ball and kick butt.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Title IX and all such measures that aim at
equalizing opportunities in this country have done. They have
opened up the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Go back to the sidelines, back 30 years, to the 10-year-old girl
good enough to practice but not play. She might not be able to put
that loss of opportunity into words. This one could not have. But
the forty-something woman can tell you precisely how not being in
the game narrowed her view of the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   It is no different than the way a staircase makes a person in a
wheelchair feel. No different than when a black child looks around
and sees no black teachers, doctors or police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, take a long look at the game film from the World Cup
championship. Take a long look at the young women right in front of
your eyes who in summer whip softballs past batters with the grace
of Cy Young. And take a look at the fans who cheer them, not for
their pretty faces, but for their skill and determination.
</P>
<P>
   How does the world change? In slow, almost unrecognizable
increments.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes that change just happens. But more times than not, it
takes a well-placed kick.

A NEW, CAUTIOUS PILOT WHO OFTEN FLEW WITH HIS INSTRUCTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: KENNEDY-MISSING-PLANE, KENNEDY-TRAGEDY, KENNEDY-SEARCH,
KENNEDY-NY-SCENE, KENNEDY-MASS-SCENE) 
(mk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy Jr. was a relatively new pilot, apparently
relatively cautious, flying a new, expensive and well-equipped
private plane.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy earned his private pilot's license in early 1998,
according to officials at the Federal Aviation Administration, who
did not have a more precise date Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Public records show that he was still a flight student in
December 1997. He apparently did not have an instrument rating,
meaning that he was not qualified to fly in conditions that
required reliance on instrument navigation, but the weather on
Friday night was suitable for a pilot of his rating.
</P>
<P>
   The flight may have been challenging, though, authorities said,
because on the most direct route, the distance to shore far exceeds
the distance that the plane could glide if the single engine
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had registered the plane, a Piper Saratoga, in April. A
pilot who flies from the same airfield, Essex Airport in Fairfield,
N.J., said that he and Kennedy used the same flight instructor, and
that Kennedy frequently flew with the instructor to Martha's
Vineyard on Friday nights, and returned on Sunday nights or Monday
mornings. The instructor, the pilot said, was not aboard the
Saratoga on Friday night; he was in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had been flying from Essex Airport for about a year,
said James Paganelli, chairman of the Essex County Improvement
Authority, speaking at a news conference at the airport. About 350
planes are registered there, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, who asked not to be identified by name, said he saw
the Kennedy party preparing to depart Friday night at about 8:15.
Kennedy was dressed in white slacks and T-shirt; his wife, Carolyn
Bessette Kennedy, wore black pants and black T-shirt, and another
woman was wearing a beige dress, he said. (Other reports said that
Ms. Bessette Kennedy's sister, Lauren Bessette, flew with them.)
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy appeared to have an injury to one foot or leg, the pilot
said, and was ``pivoting around on one spot.'' He had what appeared
from a distance to be a crutch, but was not using it, the other
pilot said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's rudder is controlled with foot pedals. It was not
clear Saturday whether Kennedy's apparent injury might have
affected his ability to control the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot said he had previously spoken to Kennedy about their
mutual instructor. ``He always said he had an instructor fly with
him a lot in the Saratoga,'' said the pilot. ``He may have been
getting accustomed to a new plane, and trying to enhance his
skills, even though he had the license.'' Aviation experts said he
might have been practicing for obtaining an instrument rating.
</P>
<P>
   The instructor, the pilot said, had said that ``he had a good
time'' flying with Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   An air traffic controller, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Kennedy had been given clearance by the tower to
take off, but had not contacted the New York Terminal Radar
Approach Control, which would be the first air traffic control
office with jurisdiction over a flight under instrument rules.
</P>
<P>
   But under visual flight rules, which were in effect during the
flight, if Kennedy chose to take responsibility himself for
spotting other air traffic and staying a safe distance away, and if
he did not need to ask about weather conditions ahead, he was under
no obligation to check in. Private planes commonly do not fly under
air traffic control.
</P>
<P>
   The plane carried a transponder, a device that automatically
responds to a query from FAA radar, stating the airplane's identity
and altitude. But for private flights like this one, the
transponder would be responding with a generic code meaning it was
a general aviation flight and not giving its precise identity. FAA
technicians Saturday were sorting through all such flights the
previous night.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's Saratoga was almost new, the pilot said. The Saratoga
can carry six or seven people, including two people in the front,
each of whom has flight controls. The plane has a single,
300-horsepower, six-cylinder engine, a little bigger than an engine
in a large car. It can carry about 1,100 pounds, including people,
baggage and fuel. It carries about 100 gallons of fuel. List price
on new Saratogas is $419,000 for the base model, with various
options available.
</P>
<P>
   Small private airplanes typically do not carry cockpit voice
recorders or flight data recorders, but accident investigators can
usually determine from the wreckage such questions as whether the
propeller was intact and rotating at impact, and whether the plane
broke up in flight. Radar can also give useful information,
including the path of the descent.

REAL ESTATE: UNDERSTANDING THE MORTGAGE CONTINGENCY CLAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most people know that a contract to buy a house or apartment
usually contains a clause that allows the buyer to get out of the
deal if he or she does not qualify for a mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   But such clauses often provide less protection than people
think, real estate specialists say, and no protection whatsoever
when careless, overconfident buyers allow the clauses to expire
prematurely or deliberately choose to waive them to impress sellers
looking for the best deal possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The so-called mortgage contingency clause is one of the
hottest issues in real estate today,'' said Richard Nardi, general
counsel to the Mortgage Bankers Association of New York. Nardi said
that mortgage contingency clauses found in most standard real
estate contracts are misleading in several respects.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, while the term ``mortgage contingency
clause'' is commonly used to describe the contract provision that
addresses the buyer's obligation regarding his mortgage, the clause
might more appropriately be called a ``mortgage commitment
contingency clause'' because the contingency usually refers to the
issuance of the mortgage commitment, not the mortgage itself.
</P>
<P>
   So a buyer who satisfies a standard contingency clause by
obtaining a mortgage commitment, Nardi said, can still lose her
deposit if the deal falls through because the loan ultimately fails
to close. And that can happen for various reasons.
</P>
<P>
   If the buyer's circumstances change _ if, for example, money
that was supposed to be set aside for closing costs is unavailable
and must now be borrowed _ the lender could refuse to grant the
mortgage even after issuing a commitment, Nardi said. The same
thing could happen if a buyer or a spouse loses a job or incurs
additional debt after the commitment is issued but before the day
of closing.
</P>
<P>
   Oded Ben-Ami, senior loan officer for Sterling National
Mortgage, a mortgage banker based in Great Neck, N.Y., agreed that
a change in financial circumstances could lead to the revocation of
a loan commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``A commitment is a contract between the lender and the
borrower,'' Ben-Ami said, explaining that since the basis for the
commitment is the financial and credit condition of the borrower at
the time the application is made, those same conditions must exist
at the time of closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the closing table, the borrower is usually required to sign
his original application anew as an affirmation that there have
been no material changes in his situation,'' Ben-Ami said.
``Material changes can include things like loss of income or
employment, dissipation of assets, or incurring new debt. And any
material change in circumstances can easily result in a withdrawal
of an otherwise valid commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Nardi said, even commitments themselves are no longer
what they used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't understand that when these boiler-plate
clauses were drafted 10 or 15 years ago, lenders were doing all
their homework before they agreed to make a loan,'' Nardi said.
``Now, because of incredible competition in the industry, lenders
issue commitments that are contingent on so many conditions that
they are not really commitments at all.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, lenders frequently issue mortgage
commitments subject to an appraisal of the property. That is not a
problem for a buyer if the mortgage contingency clause is still in
effect at the time the appraisal is received. But if the
contingency expires before the appraisal is received, and the buyer
does not obtain an extension, he could have a problem if the
appraisal ends up being for less than what is acceptable to the
lender.
</P>
<P>
   In such a case, Nardi said, the buyer would be in the unenviable
position of either losing the deposit or being committed to buy a
house that is worth less than he agreed to pay and for which he
could not obtain financing even if he still wanted to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Seth Cohen, managing director of Home Mortgage Acceptance Corp.,
a mortgage company based in New York, said that while it might seem
naive for a buyer to consider waiving the mortgage contingency
clause or allowing it to expire, the practice is fairly common
because of the increasing use of prequalification and preapproval
letters issued by mortgage brokers and lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said that such letters give buyers a false sense of
security about their ability to obtain a mortgage, something that
can be a serious problem for those who are buying co-op apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most cases, when a bank preapproves a borrower, it's only
qualifying the borrower,'' Cohen said. ``But when a bank is making
a loan on a co-op, it's not just the borrower who has to qualify
for the loan, but the building as well.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that borrowers who are so confident they will
qualify for a share loan _ the counterpart to a mortgage in
financing a co-op _ that they are comfortable waiving the mortgage
contingency clause may be in for a surprise if the building they
are buying into doesn't pass the lender's muster.
</P>
<P>
   And that can happen, Cohen said, if more than 50 percent of the
units in a building are owned by the original sponsor or if any
individual other than the sponsor owns more than 10 percent of the
units.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, banks are typically hesitant to lend in
buildings that have fewer than 10 units, in buildings in which the
lender has already made loans to 25 percent or more of the
shareholders, and in buildings that do not have a positive cash
flow.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Cohen said, co-op buyers should check with their
mortgage broker or lender to find out, if possible, whether the
building they are buying into meets the lender's standards. That
becomes even more important, he said, for buyers who may consider
locking a seller into a deal by waiving the mortgage contingency
clause.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Gonchar, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that even
buyers who do not voluntarily waive their mortgage commitment may
do so inadvertently if they do not pay careful attention to the
contract terms and dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contracts usually contain a clause that says that if you don't
notify the seller that you have been declined for a loan within a
specified time period, you will be deemed to have waived the
contingency,'' Gonchar said.
</P>
<P>
   William Selsberg, a Stamford, Conn., lawyer, said it is for that
reason that he makes sure he knows exactly where the client is
going to be on the day the mortgage contingency clause is to
expire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them, `Act as if that's the most important day of your
life,''' Selsberg said, adding that he also instructs clients to
carefully follow other terms of the mortgage contingency clause.
For example, he said, there are occasions in which a client has
signed a contract with a mortgage contingency clause for an 80
percent mortgage who is then told that he or she can probably
qualify for a 90 percent loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to explain to them that if they apply for the bigger
loan, and the loan is declined, they are at risk of losing their
deposit because they'll be in default of the contract,'' he said.
And the only thing more risky than that, he said, is to waive the
contingency clause entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had clients who have been told that there are two or
three other buyers waiting in the wings, and to separate themselves
from the pack, they want to agree to a deal with no contingencies
whatsoever,'' Selsberg said. ``It seems that the biggest problem
real estate lawyers have today is protecting clients from
themselves.''

BATTING NO. 2 IN NEW YORK: PIAZZA AND THE METS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ For one weekend _ last weekend _ New
York's baseball spotlight finally belonged to Mike Piazza, and he
seized it with two three-run home runs as the Mets took two of
three games from the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   But now reality has returned, and the reality is that Piazza and
the Mets will once again assume their status as second-class
citizens in the New York sports caste system.
</P>
<P>
   How does Piazza, a seven-time All-Star who signed a seven-year,
$91 million contract during the off-season, feel about playing _ in
his own words _ ``second fiddle'' to the Yankees?
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think we care about that,'' Piazza said. ``It's
inevitable that the Yankees are going to be covered more or given
more exposure in New York, and that's fine. I think they've earned
it. It's nice not to worry about it. We can play our game and
hopefully get to the point where they are.''
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what Piazza is supposed to say. But how does
Piazza, who was the undisputed hero in Los Angeles while playing
for the Dodgers from 1993 to 1998, feel about being treated like
the embers compared to the inferno set off by Derek Jeter's star
turn as the Yankees' Most Valuable Player candidate? After all, the
competition for the city's buzz began early as Piazza and Jeter
shared many preseason magazine covers this spring. But Piazza
clearly likes the personable Yankee shortstop and he insists he's
not counting _ or courting _ headlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anybody who knows me knows I don't really thrive on
things like that,'' Piazza said. ``That's not what I'm all about. I
really don't think I'm an ego-driven athlete. I don't have any
problem with it. I kind of enjoy it. That's the way I've always
been. That wave of attention kind of comes and goes and I don't
mind it.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is one reason why Piazza chose to buy a home in Bergen
County, N.J., across the George Washington Bridge from Manhattan.
It's close enough to the intensity that fuels the city. But far
enough removed from it, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets care about the attention, however. Or lack of it.
Especially compared to the coverage the Yankees receive in the
local news media. The main reason, in fact, that the Mets' co-owner
Nelson Doubleday and General Manager Steve Phillips traded for
Piazza last May was to address the glaring void of a so-called
marquee player in the Mets' lineup and fill all those empty seats
at Shea Stadium in the process.
</P>
<P>
   And what did Piazza's re-signing with the Mets do to the overall
perception of Manager Bobby Valentine's team?
</P>
<P>
   ``It changed it,'' Valentine said. ``By signing back with us, he
got other people to sign with us. It bolstered our image. It made
us credible. It made us star-studded. And he's made us a very good
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Piazza re-signed, Shea Stadium had pretty much belonged
to Valentine for much of the last two seasons. Valentine craves the
spotlight and has a dominant personality. But he has become more
subdued this season, while the club has aggressively signed and
promoted its star players, Piazza in particular.
</P>
<P>
   The money the Mets spent in the off-season to upgrade their team
showed a clear commitment to building their first postseason
qualifier in 11 years. But even with Piazza and a creditable
second-place showing in the National League East, the Mets still
lag far behind the Yankees _ who have won the World Series two of
the last three seasons _ in terms of popularity and news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   That is inevitable, said John Franco, who has been with the Mets
since 1990, who grew up in Brooklyn and who played in Cincinnati
when the Mets of the 1980s captivated New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's going to change unless you win,'' Franco said. ``And
when the Mets were winning in the '80s, they were the talk of the
town.''
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-'90s, the Mets were more like the laughingstocks.
Their owners significantly slashed expenditures after the 72-90 and
59-103 debacles of 1992 and 1993. Only now is that perception
starting to change.
</P>
<P>
   But perception and reality are two different things, especially
in the hard currency of the baseball marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it has been rumored recently that Alex Rodriguez,
the gifted shortstop of the Seattle Mariners whose contract is up
after next season, has cooled on the idea of coming to the Mets
because not only would he be on the second team in town, he would
be the second shortstop in town (to Jeter) and the second player on
his own team (to Piazza).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's kind of funny,'' Piazza said when told about the
Rodriguez rumor. ``For me, it's enough to do my job every day. I
realize I do have a tremendous amount of the workload on this team.
And maybe if I played another position, I would stand around a lot
more and have the time to think about it a lot more. But I don't
care if I'm put on a cover of some magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not. But the people who pay his salary most certainly do.
Which is OK with Piazza, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone wants to promote me, fine,'' Piazza said. ``But I'm
not a self-promoter. I don't have the energy for it. I'll let my
play speak for itself.''

COMBING A BIG BAY FOR A BIG FISH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KEN SCHULTZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. _ My taste buds have never met a softshelled crab
they didn't like. To me, this molting blue crab is especially
likable when cooked on a grill after having been marinated in a
mixture of ranch dressing, olive oil, fresh garlic and lemon juice.
</P>
<P>
   So, at 7 o'clock on a recent morning, when Lenny Rudow opened a
package of 10 fresh softshells and said that this was what we would
be putting on our fishhooks to catch black drum, my eyes opened
wide. Pound for pound, softshells are two to three times the price
of lobster, another delicacy better suited to my taste buds than
those of some fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had two of these for dinner last night,'' I said as
Lenny cut a fresh, soft crab in half and threaded it on the hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how the drum are caught here,'' he answered. ``We have
to find them and drop the crab right on their noses.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a bare-bones explanation of the process, but there's
nothing simple about it. Though relatively shallow, Chesapeake Bay,
at 180 miles long, is the greatest bay on the East Coast, and not
without a lot of places to seek these fish. Finding them is not as
simple as, say, walking up to a deep pool on a trout stream.
</P>
<P>
   Black drum are powerful, stocky fish with deep bodies and an
arched back; they are capable of growing to more than 100 pounds.
They are bottom feeders that use whiskerlike chin barbells on their
lower jaw to find clams and crabs, which they crush with large
teeth in their throat.
</P>
<P>
   Black drum are not aggressive predators that see or hear their
prey and chase it, like many popular sportfish. Add to this the
fact that angling is done in 20 to 30 feet of water where there is
often significant tidal current, blowing wind and rolling waves,
and black drum fishing becomes a semicomplicated hunt bearing
little resemblance to many tightly focused angling activities.
</P>
<P>
   The major payoff is that Chesapeake drum are large and provide a
powerful tussle; it can take 15 to 20 minutes to land one on
medium-strength tackle. An amazing aspect of the Chesapeake Bay
black drum sportfishery is that angler-caught specimens weigh on
average about 40 pounds, which often makes them the largest or
near-largest fish most people have ever caught.
</P>
<P>
   The second payoff is culinary. All members of the drum family
have food value; the red drum, known as redfish and a more
southerly species, is the fare of blackened redfish fame and a
Creole staple. The black drum, though best in smaller sizes, is
often found in large fillets at market during spring and early
summer. Its flesh is tender and delicately flavored; the texture,
which is coarse rather than flaky, draws comparisons to a thick
slice of roast pork and supports diverse cooking methods,
especially grilling. Two nights earlier, a group of us had enjoyed
drum that came from a fish market and that we had broiled with a
simple lemon-pepper garnish.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny and I began our drum hunt 20 miles south of Annapolis, in
about 30 feet of water over an oyster reef. Two charter boats were
cruising the site when we arrived. Five or six anglers stood in the
stern of each boat, both classic low-slung 40-foot Chesapeake Bay
boats with wide-open cockpits and low gunwales, bracing their knees
against the gunwale with rod in hand.
</P>
<P>
   It took 2 ounces of sinker to get half a crab down to the
bottom. We searched the area, concentrating on the deep edge where
the bottom dropped off, watching for fish on the sonar. After
spotting them on the bay bottom, we immediately stopped the boat
and lowered the bait to the bottom, drifting it along. Usually
black drum travel in schools, so there could have been a number of
fish to entice at any time.
</P>
<P>
   The reef showed little on the sonar, and after an hour we picked
up and moved 6 miles south, where a cluster of five charter boats
was working another reef. We drifted close to one boat and asked
the anglers if they'd caught anything. ``Only one,'' said a burly,
shirtless fellow with his cap on backward, braced against the
transom. ``About 70 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Only one,'' I said to Lenny, with a hint of sarcasm, but he
had spotted something on the sonar and was putting the throttle in
neutral. ``Drop here.'' Down went our softshells, and we waited for
the anticipated strike of a very big fish. After drifting for
several minutes we reeled up and moved on along the oyster reef,
hunting for something else on the sonar.
</P>
<P>
   This we did for hours on end. Periodically, we saw someone on
one of the charter boats hook up, then noticed a net or gaff come
out to lift a big-bodied fish over the gunwale. But we couldn't
manage anything more than the incidental catch of one weakfish, an
undersized striped bass, and two foul-hooked menhaden, a prominent
schooling baitfish.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the afternoon we turned the boat for home. Lenny, a
writer for Boating magazine, was testing a 20-foot Nautico
catamaran-hulled boat powered by two 70-horsepower Suzuki outboard
motors. Catamaran hulls are becoming more popular on American power
boats, and this wide-beamed one was impressively stable en route
home in the bay's choppy water.
</P>
<P>
   Equally impressive was that after running nonstop all day and
covering more than 60 miles of water, the motors consumed just 22
gallons of gas. The cost of the gas, it occurred to me, was less
than the cost of the 10 delicious-looking softshell crabs that we
wasted on unappreciative drum. We should have eaten the bait
ourselves.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A small plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife,
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister, Lauren Bessette,
disappeared late Friday, and by Saturday afternoon, the authorities
had recovered debris off Martha's Vineyard, Mass., that they said
may have come from the plane.
</P>
<P>
   A Coast Guard spokesman said that debris, found about 100 yards
off Gay Head, included luggage, carpeting and a headrest.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who was believed to be piloting the plane, was flying
to the wedding of a cousin, Rory, the youngest daughter of Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy, in Hyannisport, Mass. Ms. Kennedy was to be
married Saturday before 275 guests in a private ceremony. The
wedding was postponed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Martha LaGuardia, a Coast Guard spokeswoman, said the plane,
a Piper Saratoga owned by Kennedy, left from Fairfield, N.J., at
8:38 p.m. on Friday and was scheduled to land on Martha's Vineyard
about 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration reported that the last
contact with the plane came at 9:39 p.m. when it was 17 miles from
Martha's Vineyard, the Coast Guard said in a statement. When the
plane did not arrive, the Kennedy family notified the FAA, which
began trying to track the plane, a staff member for Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kennedy compound in Hyannisport Saturday, a white tent
stood by the sea, and a flag at full staff billowed in the breeze.
A Mass was held on the porch of the house of Rory's mother, Ethel
Kennedy, with about 50 family members and three priests praying
``for the safety of the loved ones, as well as for Rory'' and her
fiance, Mark Bailey, said a family spokesman, Brian O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 38, is the only surviving son of John F. Kennedy, the
35th president. He was born on Nov. 25, 1960, weeks after his
father's election and was known to the nation as ``John-John,'' a
childhood nickname.
</P>
<P>
   After his father's assassination, the enduring image from the
funeral came when Kennedy, then a little boy in a blue coat and
shorts, saluted his father's casket outside St. Matthew's
Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   It was his third birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Given his celebrity and political pedigree, word of Kennedy's
disappearance touched off an extraordinary reaction, from the
corridors of the White House, to the major networks, which broke
into their schedules for live reports from their anchors.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, spending the weekend at Camp David, was told
about the plane's disappearance by John Podesta, his chief of
staff, shortly after 7 a.m. Saturday, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   The president called several members of the Kennedy family,
including Kennedy's sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg; Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.; and Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo,
husband of Kerry Kennedy, daughter of Robert F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our prayers and thoughts are with the families of those on
board,'' Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, the father of Andrew Cuomo,
was among many whose response Saturday was shaped by the family's
seemingly unending dance with tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' said Cuomo, ``there are just two reactions that
most people share: The almost inexplicable concentration of
tragedy, the reiteration of it in the Kennedy family, which,
perhaps because of their celebrity, seems almost unique. And the
second more important impression is the way they react to their
tragedy over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not by becoming bitter and cursing the gods who did this
to them. It is by becoming more generous and turning to works of
commitment, especially for those people most in need.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House said search efforts were being coordinated by
the Coast Guard, the U.S. Department of Transportation and the
Department of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force Rescue Coordination Center out of Langley Air
Force Base in Virginia was leading the search, with help from Coast
Guard vessels dispatched from Cape Cod and Montauk, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The search was being conducted along the presumed flight path of
Kennedy's plane.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard said that in addition to a number of vessels, it
had deployed two H-60s, or Jayhawk, helicopters and a Falcon
fixed-wing jet. They were searching off Cape Code, in Block Island
Sound, in Long Island Sound, and along the South Shore of Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've set up search areas that would cover any possible area
the plane would have flown over,'' Ms. LaGuardia said. ``We would
hope that if there was a distress signal we would be able to pick
up on it.'' But, she said, ``I have not been able to confirm any
kind of signal.''
</P>
<P>
   Other agencies joined the search. The Air National Guard of
Gabreski, New York, dispatched a C-130 cargo plane. Fifteen
airplanes from the Civil Air Patrol were searching, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have three marine boats searching the North Shore area,
from Huntington out east,'' said Officer Robert Harris of the
Suffolk County (N.Y.) Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. LaGuardia said she did not know who was piloting the plane.
Some news reports said Kennedy, who obtained his pilot's license
last year, was at the controls. Other reports said a flight
instructor was on board.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board, Ted
Lopatkiewicz, said his agency, which investigates all plane
crashes, was standing by. ``We wouldn't know where to go at this
stage,'' he said. The Safety Board got the report of an overdue
plane at about 5 a.m., he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board early Saturday morning
sent investigators to the airport in Caldwell to gather records and
speak to ground personnel, according to a person answering the
phone at the airport operations center. The Safety Board's regional
office is nearby, in Parsippany, N.J.

</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe that something like this could happen _ again
_ to the Kennedy family,'' said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York,
speaking at the city's Office of Emergency Management on the 23rd
floor of the World Trade Center. ``Let's hope and pray that it's a
successful effort,'' he said of the search.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said the New York Police
Department, acting on a request from the Kennedy family early
Saturday, had dispatched officers to Kennedy's Manhattan apartment
to make sure he was not there.
</P>
<P>
   The family also asked the police to make sure Kennedy's car was
the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Bailey, 25, a merchandising analyst from Cedar Grove, N.J.,
and a pilot flying from this airport for 13 years, said he saw
Kennedy and his wife at about 8 p.m. Friday as they walked toward
Kennedy's plane parked at Essex Airport in Caldwell. In the
airport, a group of teen-age girls caught sight of him and gushed
about how they could not believe he had a plane at Essex Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said he watched as Kennedy walked around the outside of
the airplane and then went through a routine series of preflight
checks. Bailey said he noticed one unusual thing about Kennedy's
preflight check. Usually pilots take their planes down the runway a
bit to do their engine `rev-ups,' to avoid creating too much noise
in the parking area. But he said Kennedy did his rev-ups in the
parking space.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impression I got was maybe there was something wrong with
the plane. It just caught my attention, like, `Why is he doing this
here?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Kennedy's plane took off heading south, then turned west
and then headed northwest, toward Martha's Vineyard. Bailey, who
flew to Martha's Vineyard two weeks ago, said the ocean route can
be hazardous, especially at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flying over the ocean at night isn't the safest feeling. I
know that route and at night with fog it can become dangerous,'' he
said. ``I went home to my family and said, `He's going to kill
himself one day in that airplane.' I mean, it was really a hazy
night,'' Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft such as the Piper do not carry flight data recorders or
cockpit voice recorders, the ``black boxes'' that investigators use
to piece together the details of airliner crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was flying under visual flight rules, meaning that the
pilot took responsibility for picking his route and avoiding other
traffic, rather than relying on air traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the FAA's air traffic control system did not assign it a
specific beacon code; it would have showed up on controllers' radar
screens with a generic symbol denoting general aviation.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators could pick it out, though, if they knew its hour
of departure and general route. That might help locate the wreckage
or, if could give a clue if the plane broke up in flight, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Though wind conditions were mild on Friday night, visibility in
the area was poor, pilots said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very hazy, and it was very dark, and it was very hard
to see the horizon,'' said Michael C. Bard, a private pilot, who
left Martha's Vineyard about 9:15 p.m. on Friday and flew back to
his home in Danbury, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not instrument rated, it could be difficult
maintaining the airplane in an upright condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Lorenzo, the owner of Caldwell Flight Academy, which
operates at Essex County Airport, said he believed Kennedy was in
the process of getting his instrument license, which allows pilots
to fly in cloudy or bad weather, using only instruments.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Brown University, Kennedy went to law
school and joined the Manhattan district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 he started the magazine George _ subtitled ``not just
politics as usual.'' A year later, Kennedy _ once dubbed ``the
sexiest man alive'' by People magazine _ married Ms. Bessette, the
whispy blond daughter of a Greenwich, Conn., doctor.
</P>
<P>
   But in Hyannisport Saturday, another Kennedy wedding was turned
into an anxious vigil. Christina Rivers of Hyannis was to dress the
hair of the bridal party before attending the wedding as a guest.
Friday night, she designed Rory's hair for the rehearsal dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just wonderful over there last night, just exciting,''
Ms. Rivers said. ``It's just not fair. I don't know what it is, but
it's not fair.''

A WEARY POSTAL SERVICE PROCEEDING ON SCHEDULE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBI, France _ Defending the yellow jersey of its and the Tour
de France's leader, the U.S. Postal Service team spent another
uneventful day Saturday, but even on quiet days the psychological
and physical toll is high on a team trying to control the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm weary,'' said Frankie Andreu, of Dearborn, Mich., who is
in his eighth Tour and has never failed to finish one yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait for the rest day,'' he added. That will come
Monday, at the foot of the Pyrenees.
</P>
<P>
   A teammate, Tyler Hamilton, of Brookline, Mass., agreed with him
before the day's stage. ``Feeling pretty tired,'' he said. ``It's a
lot of work at the front of the pack. Of course, it's all worth it.
This team is dedicated to keeping Lance in the yellow jersey,
whatever it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   It did not take much Saturday. Sixteen riders were allowed to
break away at Kilometer 8 (Mile 5) of the 236.5-kilometer
(147-mile) 13th stage from St. Flour to Albi. As in the first two
of four days' passage from the Alps to the Pyrenees, the 16 riders
were all far behind in the overall time standing and no threat to
Lance Armstrong, the Texan in the yellow jersey. The attack went
according to the Postal Service plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day we chased down a lot of breaks,'' Andreu said.
</P>
<P>
   When Armstrong's rivals were either caught or discouraged, a
bunch of lesser lights was granted free passage. ``Yesterday,''
Andreu continued Saturday morning, ``we were too spent to chase
much, so we just let them go. Same thing today, I expect.''
</P>
<P>
   It was. The 16, who quickly shrunk to 15 when one rider could
not keep pace, were mainly Italians and Spaniards far down in the
ranking for the Tour, which ends July 25.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 passed over seven testing hills, up and down all day,
until they sighted the red roofs that testify to Albi's
Mediterranean orientation. For the last 50 kilometers (31 miles)
there was scarcely a house along the race's roads that did not have
its shutters closed against the sun.
</P>
<P>
   After 5 hours 52 minutes 45 seconds, the winner was Salvatore
Commesso, the Italian national champion and a rider for Saeco, who
outsprinted Marco Serpellini, an Italian with Lampre, by two
seconds after the group of 15 came together. Third, 2:07 behind,
was Mariano Piccolli, another Italian with Lampre. The winner's
average time of 40 kilometers an hour (25 miles an hour) was
startling in the first heavy heat of the race.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders' pack finished 22:24 later. Armstrong remained in
the lead by 7:44 over Abraham Olano, a Spaniard with ONCE, and by
7:47 over Alex Zuelle.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of his teammates, Armstrong was saucy Saturday
morning, for at least three reasons. For one, he usually is. For
another, he is comfortable and confident as the Tour's leader and
possibly the first American since Greg LeMond in 1990, and only the
second in history, to win the sport's most prestigious race, which
began in 1903.
</P>
<P>
   For a third, he does not ride at the very front of the pack,
like Hamilton, setting the pace. The Texan races instead in his
teammates' slipstream, saving about 20 percent of the energy that
the rider up ahead is expending.
</P>
<P>
   Until Armstrong joined the team last year, the U.S. Postal
Service had little experience in controlling a race for a leader.
``We did it for Eki in the Dauphine two years ago,'' Hamilton said.
``Then we did it for Jonathan in the same race last month.'' He
referred to Slava Ekimov, a Russian who was the former team leader,
and Jonathan Vaughters, who led the Dauphine for three days before
he finished second.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughters, of Englewood, Colo., quit the Tour de France after he
crashed and injured himself during the second of 20 stages. Postal
Service lost another of its nine men Saturday when Peter
Meinert-Nielsen of Denmark had to abandon competition because of a
damaged knee.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the overall plan is working. Neither Olano nor
Zuelle has tried to attack in the four transitional stages,
preferring instead to await the mountains. Even when a rider not so
low-placed has infiltrated a breakaway and gained time, the
American team has stayed the course. An example is Stephane Heulot,
a Frenchman with La Francaise des Jeux, who ranked 21st, more than
20 minutes behind Armstrong, on Friday morning. He rose to sixth
after he was part of an escape and gained more than 11 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heulot doesn't worry us,'' Andreu said. ``He's still nine
minutes back, and the way Lance is climbing, he'll take a bundle
out of him in the Pyrenees.''

 JOAN WIGHT, WIFE AND MODEL FOR AUTHOR HERRIOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joan Wight, the widow of the Yorkshire veterinarian who wrote
under the name James Herriot and the model for a character in his
books and television programs based on them, died on Wednesday. She
was in her 80s.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wight's health slowly declined after her husband died in
1995 at age 78, said Thomas McCormack, the former editor in chief
of St. Martin's Press, which published the first five Herriot
books.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, whose real name was James Alfred Wight, vividly
depicted his wife as the endearing and supportive Helen Herriot in
his memoirs, beginning with ``All Creatures Great and Small.''
McCormack described Ms. Wight as the model for ``the humorous,
loving and, from time to time, tolerating wife of James Herriot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All Creatures Great and Small'' became the basis for a
long-running television series, which was originally a BBC-TV
production and later a cable television series in the United
States. Its accounts of rural life attracted an audience of
millions around the world. On television, Helen was played first by
Carol Drinkwater and later by Lynda Bellingham. In a 1979 movie,
``All Things Bright and Beautiful,'' Helen was portrayed by Lisa
Harrow.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``All Creatures Great and Small'' became a best seller,
it was not reviewed until months after its publication, when
strongly positive word-of-mouth reports had begun to make it
famous.
</P>
<P>
   One episode in the first Herriot book describes how Ms. Wight
met her future husband. She grew up on a farm in Yorkshire not far
from ``the surgery,'' as Wight's veterinary hospital was known.
</P>
<P>
   One day, she brought in a calf with a broken leg. Wight repaired
the damage with a splint. Later, she brought in a dog with a
dislocated hip, and this time, he had eyes only for her. They soon
became engaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``A characteristic scene comes in the final chapter of `All
Creatures Great and Small,' '' McCormack said. ``The scene tells of
Joan's and James' honeymoon, which is interrupted by a sudden, mad
crush of work, which kills their hope of taking a trip. As Joan
sits with notebook on her knee and pencil at the ready, she smiles.
It was a magnificent, loving ending.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wight is survived by a son, James, and a daughter, Rosemary
Page, both of Yorkshire in northern England. &QL;

CHESTER HERWITZ, 72; COLLECTED ART FROM INDIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (js)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chester Herwitz, who with his wife, Davida, amassed one of the
world's largest collections of modern art from India, died on June
17 in a three-car collision in Petersham, Mass. Herwitz, who lived
in Worcester, Mass., was 72.
</P>
<P>
   His wife was injured in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Herwitz, owner of a leather company, first visited India with
his wife in 1961, and they returned often. In the mid-1960s, they
began buying paintings by M.F. Husain, who introduced them to other
artists. Their varied collection grew to include 3,000 works.
</P>
<P>
   The Herwitzes also maintained the Chester and Davida Herwitz
Charitable Trust to support Indian art in the United States. In
1997, a former president of India, Ramaswamy Venkataraman,
presented Herwitz with an Indo-American Society award.
</P>
<P>
   Works from the Herwitz collection have been exhibited at the
Tate Gallery in London; the Pompidou Center in Paris; the Art
Institute of Chicago; the Worcester Art Museum and the Grey Gallery
in Manhattan. Two exhibitions from the collection are on view:
``Timeless Visions: Contemporary Art of India,'' at the Peabody
Essex Museum in Salem, Mass., and ``Kalighat Painting: Images from
a Changing World,'' at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Herwitz is survived by his wife; three sons, Daniel, of South
Africa, Thomas, of Silver Spring, Md., and Peter, of New York; a
brother, David, of Swampscott, Mass.; two sisters, Phyllis Kline
and Eunice Holsberg, both of Washington, and four grandchildren. &QL;

HEAT TAKES ANOTHER SHOT AT THE CITY'S WEATHERED POPULACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ First the good news: the temperatures actually were
cooler Saturday than those that seared the metropolitan region over
the Fourth of July weekend. But most people, until they looked at a
thermometer, refused to believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like it's 99 degrees,'' said Rosell Stone, a
68-year-old woman who was the first person to seek refuge Saturday
at the East River Community Center on East 105th Street, where the
city has set up an emergency cooling center for those without
air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Stone spoke, it was, in fact, only in the high 80s. And
forecasters said the temperatures were expected to climb to no more
than 98, just shy of the 101-degree highs during the last heat
wave. The heat index, the combination of temperature and relative
humidity that gives a better indication of how hot the day feels,
was expected to reach 105 to 110, also a little cooler than the
last hot spell, which the city medical examiner's office said was
responsible for 31 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's really little comfort,'' said Paul Knight, a
meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University, who added that the
high temperatures were expected to last at least until Friday.
``For those susceptible to the heat, it's probably going to feel
pretty much the same.''
</P>
<P>
   And around the city, those who contend directly with the results
of the heat _ workers for Consolidated Edison, city emergency
officials, police officers and hospitals _ braced for exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very, very difficult day,'' said Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani, who joined Jerome M. Hauer, the city's director of
emergency services, and other officials Saturday at the city's
Emergency Command Center at the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopeful we can get through the day without a blackout, a
brownout or some kind of significant problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Con Edison officials said they were much better prepared heading
into this stretch of hot days than during the last heat wave, when
several cables feeding electricity to the northern part of
Manhattan were out of service even before the hot weekend began. As
of Saturday morning, said Joseph Petta, a spokesman for the power
company, seven of 1,150 feeder cables were out of service
throughout the 604 square miles of the company's service area. On
July 2, before the last heat wave, 13 cables were not working.
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of problems are not uncommon even during mild
summers, Petta said. ``It's unfortunate that we're so much under
the microscope here,'' he added. ``On any given day, we take
feeders out for general maintenance all the time, and there could
easily be seven down. But during a heat wave, those numbers get a
lot of attention.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Petta said that all the cables in northern Manhattan that were
damaged during the last heat wave had been repaired and that those
down Saturday _ five in Westchester, one in the Bronx and one in
Queens _ had left only nine customers without power as of Saturday
morning. On July 6, to prevent more damage to the system, Con Ed
shut down power to about 200,000 people north of 155th Street. The
blackout lasted 18 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Con Edison engineers said that by 11 a.m. Saturday, the power
drain on the system was 8,500 megawatts and was expected to rise to
9,500, less than Friday's total of 10,800 and far less than that
used during the last heat wave, which set a record with 11,800
megawatts used. Nonetheless, the company had deployed crews to
monitor the system ``at a level we usually employ only during
extreme emergency conditions,'' Petta said.
</P>
<P>
   And the test will be whether the system can hold up after the
weekend, when workers return to offices and power use typically
increases dramatically. Knight said that more clouds Sunday would
probably bring the temperatures down to about 95, but that the
unusual heat would likely continue at least to the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, he said, the third week in July is the hottest of the
summer in the metropolitan region. By the end of this week, he
said, the forecast is for temperatures ``much above normal,''
though he did not predict a high.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani _ who has strongly criticized Con Edison's preparedness
for heat waves and prompted the city to sue the company last week
for damage caused by the blackout _ did not take the company to
task Saturday. He said that since the failures of the last heat
wave, the company had been in closer touch with city officials, and
most Con Edison officials believed there would not be another
widespread blackout.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point,'' Giuliani said, ``I think they believe they're
going to get through Saturday OK I think their concern is more
focused toward Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Water usage _ which was also a serious issue during the last
heat wave as illegally opened hydrants reduced water pressure in
northern Manhattan _ appeared to be within safe limits Saturday,
said Joel A. Miele, the commissioner of the Department of
Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 23 hydrants were opened illegally overnight Friday,
he said, and New York's water system has remained the only one in
the state not to be placed on a drought watch. ``The pressure is
good and strong,'' Miele said, ``and we'd like to keep it that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   While uncomfortably above average, the high temperatures
Saturday were not expected to break any records.
</P>
<P>
   They were expected to edge very close, though.
</P>
<P>
   The record high for July 17 in the city was 100 degrees, set in
1953, and the record for July 18 was 101, set in the same year. But
Knight said that because of the heavy humidity _ about 49 percent
just after noon _ the heat index for the weekend was solidly in
``that dangerous zone.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not have to tell Ricardo Villarine, a 38-year-old Bronx
man who carried his 1{-year-old daughter, Lisette, from her
grandmother's apartment on East 105th Street to a wildly spouting
hydrant on the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Villarine said he suffers from asthma, which is made worse by
heat and humidity. ``I hang around places where I know the
hospitals are close,'' he said. Saturday, after walking several
blocks with his daughter, he stepped happily right into the spray
of the hydrant.
</P>
<P>
   Near him, Niky Zapata, 8, was busy filling up water balloons and
wished he could douse himself, too. ``But my mother said I couldn't
get wet,'' he said, ``because I already took a bath.''

COMMENTARY: JUNGLE'S GIFT _ PURE WATER FROM SEWAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LLOYD, N.Y. _ In his 28 years working at sewage-treatment
plants, John Jankiewicz has not known much excitement. You watch
gauges, check the bacteria that digest waste, find cheap ways to
dispose of sludge, keep turning gray water into clear water.
</P>
<P>
   Once, he found a quarter-carat diamond in a grit-collecting
grate. His mother-in-law now wears it, Jankiewicz said. ``She knows
where it came from,'' he said. ``She doesn't mind.''
</P>
<P>
   But one day last year, he said, while attending one of an
endlessly boring series of conferences that are required to keep
his license current, he found himself energized by one speaker's
message: Simple beds of marsh grass can clean waste water as
effectively as costly assemblages of concrete tanks, steel pipes
and electricity-hungry oxygen pumps.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the speaker was saying that ``everything I've been
doing for 28 years is a stupid waste,'' Jankiewicz recalled. The
talk described a ``reed bed'' treatment system in a small town in
the Ecuadorean rain forest that used no electricity and required
hardly any maintenance. It was even capable of turning rivulets of
offal from a slaughterhouse into drinkable water. All with beds of
tall grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded far too good to be true,'' Jankiewicz said. So he
began tossing questions at the speaker, Dr. Ronald Lavigne, an
environmental technology expert from the University of
Massachusetts, and each one was answered.
</P>
<P>
   Jankiewicz, 49, the water and sewer administrator for Lloyd,
population 9,000, persuaded the town supervisor to send him 3,300
miles south to Shushufindi, a similar-sized oil-prospecting town
deep in the Ecuadorean jungle, to check out the idea. A few months
later, Jankiewicz, who had never traveled abroad, was in a tropical
version of the Wild West, witnessing a near lynching as a mob
tackled a man with a machete who had attacked a woman.
</P>
<P>
   But he also saw the treatment system work. Last summer, he built
a pilot-sized version back at the sewage plant in this sleepy
Ulster County town of cider mills, orchards and scattered
industrial parks.
</P>
<P>
   Now Jankiewicz stood next to the 30-by-50-foot patch of eye-high
phragmites reeds that he planted last year and described how the
reeds suck water from tons of sludge and pump oxygen through mats
of roots to buried bacteria, which break down noxious materials in
the waste. No need for machines to do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance? He won't have to clean out the bed for eight or
nine years. And the plants do their job winter or summer.
</P>
<P>
   Lavigne was in Lloyd to check up on the project. He said
different versions of the system are used elsewhere in the
Northeast. A fish farm in Massachusetts uses beds of basil to treat
waste.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd's man-made marsh sits next to a building housing the
energy-guzzling press that is the standard way of squeezing water
from sludge. The marsh is doing the same job for about half the
cost, Jankiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
   Artificial marshes may not only save money at the treatment
plant, but also keep 300 jobs in Lloyd that might have shifted to
New Jersey. A German-owned company that makes light fixtures four
miles from the sewage plant had a failed septic system. Building a
sewer line was too costly, so the company was considering moving
out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, the company, Zumtobel Staff Lighting, is going to
use an artificial marsh beyond its parking lot to treat its waste
water, Jankiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by Jankiewicz, two cider mills in the area are building
artificial wetlands to treat their annual autumn flood of unusable
juice and other waste.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, costly, energy-guzzling equipment is being
replaced by nothing but plants. Jankiewicz said he has been reading
lots of books on global environmental issues lately. It's nice to
do something in Lloyd that might, in a small way, reduce the town's
impact on the planet, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the sewage plant, Jankiewicz pointed to an adjacent
house lot that the town has just bought so he can expand to a
full-sized sludge-treating marsh, bypassing one step in the
process. ``This is not a delicate experiment,'' he said. ``I've
flooded it with sludge, drowned the plants. And it just keeps on
ticking.''

RUMMANA HUSSAIN, 47, INDIAN CONCEPTUAL ARTIST 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Rummana Hussain, a painter and conceptual artist who was also
active in Indian politics, died on July 5 at her home in Bombay.
She was 47.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said the photographer Ram Rahman, a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hussain, who came from a prominent Muslim family in Bombay,
was for much of her career a painter of allegorical figurative
subjects. But political events in India, particularly the
destruction of a mosque by Hindu militants in the city of Ayodhya
in 1992 and the subsequent attacks on Muslims, spurred her into
political action and changed the direction of her work.
</P>
<P>
   She participated in demonstrations protesting both the Ayodhya
incident and growing religious nationalism in India. She developed
a photo-based feminist art that brought images of ruined
architecture, land and the female body together in pointed
combinations.
</P>
<P>
   As an artist in residence at Art in General, an alternative
space in Manhattan, she created a video-based installation last
fall. Titled ``In Between,'' the video combined images of Bombay
with others of South Asian immigrant life in New York and
alternated shots of the artist under treatment in a Manhattan
hospital with others of her walking across the Queensboro Bridge
wearing the tinkling ankle bells of an Indian classical dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hussain showed widely in India and in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her husband, Ishaat, and a daughter, Shazmin.

DHARMAWARA MAHATHERA DIES; CAMBODIAN MONK WAS 110 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By BARBARA STEWART    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Venerable Dharmawara Mahathera, a high-ranking Buddhist monk
who advised kings and prime ministers and established a new life
after the age of 90 as a Buddhist leader in the United States, died
on June 26 in Stockton, Calif., and his body was cremated as part
of a 14-day ceremony that ended on July 10. He was 110.
</P>
<P>
   His funeral was attended by hundreds of people, spilling out the
doorway of Wat Dharmawararam, his Buddhist temple in Stockton. They
included Cambodian and other Southeast Asian laypeople, Western and
Asian disciples wearing white, and Cambodian monks, in orange.
</P>
<P>
   Though his full name was Samdach Vira Dharmawara Bellong
Mahathera _ which combines his Buddhist names, his Buddhist rank
and his family name of Bellong _ he was always called Bhante, a
Cambodian Buddhist honorific. The people who addressed him as such
included King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia, and Jawaharlal Nehru,
the first prime minister of India, whose deathbed he attended, in
addition to disciples and students throughout the West.
</P>
<P>
   At 90, Bhante moved to Stockton, where he became a father figure
to thousands of Cambodian immigrants and the religious leader of
many Vietnamese, Laotians and Westerners, said Diane Batres,
coordinator of a crime victims' services agency in the San Joaquin
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, when a gunman fatally shot five children and
himself at a Stockton elementary school, Bhante showed up
unsummoned within hours, conducting a ritual intended to dispel the
gunman's ghost and to bring peace to the souls of the murdered
children.
</P>
<P>
   Bhante was well along in life before he became a monk, and had
served as a judge and a provincial administrator. Born in Phnom
Penh into one of Cambodia's wealthiest and most illustrious
families _ his grandfather was a judge and adviser to the royal
family, and his father was a provincial chief _ he grew up
expecting to lead.
</P>
<P>
   At 40, after obtaining a law degree and serving as a judge,
Bhante left his job and pregnant wife to spend a few months resting
and meditating in a monastery, part of the Theravada tradition,
which emphasizes individual liberation through rigorous discipline.
At the end of his stay, he tried to get more time off from work,
because ``he said he felt inner peace and tranquillity and
satisfaction,'' said Konthal Cheng, his grandson and a Stockton
businessman.
</P>
<P>
   When he was turned down, he quit his job, left his wife and
2-month-old daughter and traveled to Thailand. There he received
the highest degree in Buddhist studies, equivalent to a doctorate,
and went into the jungle for six years to follow the ancient Thai
Forest Tradition, eschewing shelter, meditating day and night at
the foot of trees and eating only one light meal a day.
</P>
<P>
   His wife remarried. Every few years, he went to Cambodia to see
his daughter, Montha Long, and years later, brought two
grandchildren to live with him in India, where he founded a
monastery.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his daughter, of Seattle; eight grandchildren,
and eight great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In his later years, he was invited to speak and teach in Japan,
England and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``He translated Buddhist precepts into simple formulas _ all one
had to do to be happy,'' said Patricia Busher, principal of
Cleveland Elementary School, where the shooting took place. But his
presence was his most powerful teaching, Ms. Busher said.
</P>
<P>
   He lived simply, sharing a small house with his monks and
subsisting mainly on raw fruits and vegetables, though he
occasionally splurged.
</P>
<P>
   ``He served Neapolitan ice cream and fortune cookies at his
birthday party,'' Ms. Busher recalled. ``And he loved Coca-Cola.''

`RAGTIME' ACTOR MISSES SHOW BECAUSE OF WRONGFUL ARREST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A day after Alton Fitzgerald White was arrested,
strip-searched and then released when police acknowledged they had
erred, the actor, who plays a leading role in the Broadway musical
``Ragtime,'' said it seemed as if life had imitated art.
</P>
<P>
   In the award-winning Broadway musical, White plays Coalhouse
Walker Jr., a black man who is accosted by racist firemen as he
drives his car through turn-of-the-century New Rochelle, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Police said late Friday that White, who is black, had been
wrongfully arrested outside the lobby of his Harlem apartment
building and held for five hours, causing him to miss that night's
performance, after they received a report of drug dealing in his
building.
</P>
<P>
   White said he was leaving the building on St. Nicholas Avenue on
his way to the gym and then the theater when a female police
officer stopped him. The officer, he said, told him and three other
black men who were with him that police were looking for four black
men with guns.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Saturday that officers were in fact responding to a
call about two Hispanic men believed to be dealing drugs in the
building. White said he was handcuffed and then jailed and
strip-searched. He said he was held for two hours before he was
allowed to make a telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Saturday, White said he was talking to attorneys
about bringing a federal civil rights lawsuit against police.
</P>
<P>
   White said he suspected that he and the three men who were
walking with him were picked out because of their race.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Mode, the chief spokeswoman for the Police Department,
apologized to White and to the three others on Friday night, but
said they had fit a description given by a resident. Ms. Mode also
said that police had found a kilo of cocaine in the lobby and that
two of six men arrested there had been charged with criminal drug
possession.
</P>
<P>
   She said strip-searching was routine procedure in all felony
drug cases.
</P>
<P>
   White said the wrongful arrest and detention had shaken his
faith in the justice system.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was sitting in that jail cell, I realized that my
perception about good and justice would never be the same, just
like Coalhouse, not to the point of violence, but the naivete, it
will never be the same,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   White canceled his Saturday appearance in ``Ragtime,'' noting
that he had not slept or eaten since the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can hardly remember my name,'' he said. ``They took us out
of the cells and made us strip and squat. They made us take all the
shoe strings out of our shoes, and then they put us back in the
cells to take us out one at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   All he could think, White said, was: ```You don't care. You
don't care if I am homeless or if I am starring on Broadway.' The
second time they pulled me out for questioning, a 35-year-old man,
all I could do is sit there and cry out of frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, the executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union of New York, called White's wrongful arrest an
example of ``racial profiling in the city of New York at its
worst'' and said his group would consider filing a lawsuit on
White's behalf. ``What happened here is getting some visibility
because it was White,'' Siegel added. ``But unfortunately,
instances like this happen too often to African-American males in
the city of New York.''

HOTEL DEVELOPER AND COLLEGE DRAFTING BIG PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not too long ago, overnight accommodations around
Astor Place consisted of a curbside or a door stoop. No more.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Schrager, the hotelier behind such stylish spots as the
Royalton and Morgan's in Manhattan and the Delano in Miami Beach,
is planning a new hotel on the site of a parking lot at Astor Place
and Lafayette Street, near the Joseph Papp Public Theater. He is to
develop it with Related Cos. on a 99-year lease from the Cooper
Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, which owns the lot.
</P>
<P>
   The college has even bigger plans to transform the bubbling
Astor Place-Cooper Square crossroads in lower Manhattan from a
rough-and-tumble vortex into a grand public plaza.
</P>
<P>
   To do so, it will work closely with Schrager and Related Cos. on
the design of the new hotel. In a highly unusual competition
devised by the college, the developers will submit designs by two
renowned architects, yet to be named, for review by a Cooper Union
selection committee, in concert with Schrager and Related.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not a stranger to the process,'' said Jeff Blau,
executive vice president of Related, which sponsored a competition
of its own for public artwork at a new apartment tower on East 14th
Street, overlooking Union Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the outcome will be a fantastic building,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But it will not be easy. Under the terms of the competition, the
new structure must be an ``original artistic invention'' while
harmonizing with Cooper Union's original home, the 140-year-old
Foundation Building, which is undergoing an $11 million exterior
renovation. The hotel would also set the tone for the future plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that the building will dictate a great space, a human
space, of appealing and mesmerizing dimension,'' said John Jay
Iselin, the president of Cooper Union. ``This is the beginning of a
process that, in its own way, would be as dramatic as Rockefeller
Center.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astor Place hotel will be the first that Schrager has built
from the ground up rather than renovated, Blau said. It will have
about 100 rooms, with about 150,000 square feet of space, and may
rise 12 stories _ the height has not been determined. Completion is
expected in 2002. To fulfill Cooper Union's requirement of a
cultural tenant, there will be an art-house cinema in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on city approval and support from the community,
Cooper Union envisions closing or narrowing some stretches of
street to create a circular plaza at the hub of the jumbled
seven-way intersection where the Astor Place subway kiosk stands
and Tony Rosenthal's 10-foot steel cube, ``Alamo,'' balances on its
tip.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper Union might also redevelop the site of its bland and
outdated Engineering Building on the north side of Astor Place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do what we can with the assets we have to ensure
the long-term vitality of the school,'' said Robert Hawks, the
treasurer and vice president for business affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper Union is one of a handful of private American colleges
offering a free education _ its officials prefer the term ``full
scholarship'' _ to every student. It costs about $23,000 a year to
put each of its 950 students through school, and Cooper Union is
currently running a $5 million deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do what every other college does in the United
States: raise tuition,'' said Anthony Tung, a member of the Cooper
Union board who played a central role in drafting the hotel
competition guidelines.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Schrager and Related will pay an annual rent for the
18,000-square-foot parking-lot site, as well as an amount
equivalent to the real-estate taxes on the property, from which the
college is exempt. Neither the developers nor school officials
would divulge the figures.
</P>
<P>
   But Tung said the tax exemption, as well as Cooper Union's
reputation for excellence in architecture, heightened the sense of
civic responsibility in developing the site. ``It became crucial
here, as a moral issue, that we build well in every sense,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The architects will have 75 days to prepare their proposals.
College officials and developers will take two weeks to choose. The
Cooper Union selection committee includes the architects Charles
Gwathmey and Francois de Menil and the designer Milton Glaser.
</P>
<P>
   Iselin said the competition represented ``a new chapter in
colleges claiming the future for the benefit of the citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   It is less clear how it will benefit the alumni or faculty.
Schrager is winnowing his list of architects, which includes Sir
Norman Foster of Britain and Herzog &AMP; de Meuron of Switzerland but
apparently no one connected with the Irwin S. Chanin School of
Architecture at Cooper Union. A spokeswoman said late Friday
afternoon that Schrager could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Eisenman, the Chanin distinguished professor at Cooper
Union, won a competition last month for his plan to redevelop the
area of the West 30s between Eighth Avenue and the Hudson River. He
said he knew nothing of the Astor Place contest until a reporter
telephoned him on Friday for his reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenman relayed a request for an interview to John Hejduk, the
dean of the architecture school, who was responsible 25 years ago
for renovating the Foundation Building. Dean Hejduk, whose
telephone number is unlisted, replied through Eisenman that he did
not want to discuss the matter.

OLD BUILDINGS, NEW HOUSING IN BALTIMORE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (js) 
 By CHARLES BELFOURE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ With the help of a recently enacted state loan
program and city property tax abatements, the conversion of
outdated commercial buildings into downtown apartments here is
gathering momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The Downtown Housing Initiative, a public-private program to
develop new housing, is expected to have 414 units under
construction by the end of 1999 in four buildings, including a 1903
hotel and an 1878 warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Conversion of those buildings will begin in the next few months.
The most prominent is the Hecht Co. Building, a former department
store on the corner of Lexington and Howard streets, once
Baltimore's premier shopping district. The $10-million project will
convert the eight-story building into 173 apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Others include the Congress Hotel, which will be transformed
into 36 luxury apartments; the Abell Building, a landmark warehouse
that will be converted into 40 apartments, and the Stanbalt
Building, built by John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust in
1922, which will have 143 apartments. The buildings are all
considered inappropriate for commercial use.
</P>
<P>
   The first major conversion will be the Hecht venture by Southern
Management of Tyson's Corner, Va., the largest apartment owner in
the Baltimore metropolitan area with 25 percent of all rental
units.
</P>
<P>
   Over a year ago, the Downtown Housing Initiative told David
Hillman, chief executive of Southern Management, about the vacant
department store. He entered into negotiations with Merchant Equity
Financial Group, a real-estate investment company based in New York
City that had purchased the building from the Rite Aid drugstore
chain. Southern Management bought the building in late June for
$4.7 million, with Rite Aid retaining the first floor in a
sale-leaseback agreement with Merchant Equity. The seven floors
above Rite Aid will become one- and two-bedroom apartments, some
with an additional loft level.
</P>
<P>
   The Hecht Building, one of four former flagship department
stores still standing on Howard Street, was constructed in 1924 in
a Classical Revival style for the Bernheimer-Leader Store. It was
sold in the late 1920s to May Co., which eventually merged with
Hecht's in 1958. The store was closed in the late '80s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Southern Management's decision to purchase the department store
was spurred in part by the success of their Gallery Tower project,
a renovation of a long-vacant apartment building six blocks to the
north.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks after Gallery Tower opened, two-thirds of the 144
one-bedroom units were leased. With the exception of one person,
all the tenants who had moved into the city were from out of town.
``It was a market I didn't expect,'' said Hillman. ``We're seeing a
whole new segment of people moving downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   Some would say Hillman is taking a risk in buying Hecht's and
converting it to a residential use. For Howard Street, once filled
with shoppers, is now lined with vacant storefronts along with
scattered beeper and stereo stores. The other former department
store buildings, Stewart's, Hochilds-Kohn and Hutzler's have, or
eventually will have, commercial tenants. ``David's definitely
doing frontier stuff,'' Tracy Durkin, the director of the Downtown
Housing Initiative, said of Hillman. ``He's the first to go in.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hillman is quite confident in his strategy, ``If you were in a
helicopter over the city,'' he said, ``you'd see the Howard-Eutaw
Street corridor is the next place for development.'' The corridor
is eight blocks northwest of the Inner Harbor and adjacent to the
University of Maryland's Baltimore campus. It plays an important
role in the conversion program, acting as a kind of spine along
which other projects are planned.
</P>
<P>
   Five blocks up from Hillman's project, near the corner of Howard
and Franklin streets, is the Congress Hotel, the next major project
to go forward, probably by the fall, according to David Beecher,
senior project manager for Streuver Brothers Eccles and Rouse, the
developer.
</P>
<P>
   The ornate Second Empire building, developed by James Kernan, a
theater impresario after whom the $4.4-million project will be
named, will become an upscale apartment complex with retail space
on the ground floor. Along with the now demolished Maryland Theater
and the Auditorium, the Congress was originally part of an
entertainment and hotel complex built by Kernan called the Triple
Million Dollar Enterprise, which showcased some of the country's
top performers. A basement space with a 50-foot-long marble bar
upon which Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire danced will be rented as
a bar and restaurant.

</P>
<P>
   The plan to create downtown apartments in obsolete buildings
originated in late 1997, when the Downtown Partnership _ a business
improvement organization that works with the city to make its
downtown attractive to commercial enterprises _ looked for new ways
to fill vacant buildings. A task force was set up to study the
feasibility of an office-conversion program.
</P>
<P>
   A market study found that all existing downtown residential
units were fully rented with waiting lists. While a strong demand
existed, there were still economic obstacles as well as a lack of
commitment on the part of the city.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the task force's recommendations, financial
incentives were introduced. For the 1998-99 fiscal year, the
Maryland General Assembly passed legislation to add $3 million to
the state's Department of Housing and Community Development budget,
specifically for below-market-interest-rate short-term financing
for the conversion of commercial buildings to rental housing in
downtown Baltimore. About $2 million is available for projects in
fiscal year 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Another key financial incentive passed was the Pilot (payment in
lieu of taxes) Program, under which a building's property taxes
would either be deferred or abated for a certain time period.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the proposed buildings qualify as historic structures
and can raise additional equity through the federal and state
historic tax credit programs. This is the key component of the
Hecht Co. financing, said Hillman, who is opposed to the gap
financing for the conversions. ``The historic tax credit program
and the property tax abatements are OK, but a project must be able
to stand on its own instead of relying on public financing,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The task force also recommended that the city give more support
to the conversion program, which led to the creation of the
Downtown Housing Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``By setting up a Downtown Housing Council that facilitates the
entire effort and is headed by the housing commissioner, Daniel P.
Henson III, the city brings all the players to the table, making it
easier for developers to do projects in an expedient manner,'' said
Laurie Schwartz, president of the Downtown Partnership. In
addition, Ms. Durkin was hired as full-time coordinator to help
developers and identify possible future projects. She has
pinpointed 75 potential buildings for conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Developers, however, cite the recent Westside Plan as the real
catalyst for the conversion program. The city is planning a
$350-million redevelopment of an area that includes many of the
proposed conversions in the Howard-Eutaw Street corridor. ``We
wouldn't be doing this unless the city was committed to the west
side,'' said Beecher, the Congress Hotel project manager.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Durkin, who foresees the completion of 1,000 apartments over
the next two years, has high hopes for the program. ``The early
conversions will first attract downtown employees, students and
young professionals and once they go in, others will follow, along
with retail,'' she said. ``In two years, you're going to see a lot
of changes around here.''

 &HT;    Atlanta Olympic Games records to be opened
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Atlanta Olympic officials plan to unlock the doors Monday on a
vast and historic record of the city's Olympic experience and
invite everyone in to take a look.
</P>
<P>
   In making available for the first time some 5,700 boxes of
documents and artifacts, the officials are loosening their
long-held grip on privacy and opening the 1996 Centennial Games to
microscopic scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the treasure trove, the public, researchers and
journalists likely will find much of the behind-the-scenes story on
the staging and organization of Atlanta's biggest organized event
ever.
</P>
<P>
   It may be the most complete history of an Olympic Games ever
compiled.
</P>
<P>
   Historians are eager to pull off the lids on everything from
fence-mending correspondence between the Atlanta organizers and
despondent Athens bidders, to memos documenting the animosity
between Billy Payne and IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch, and
the real story behind Coca-Cola's involvement in Atlanta's bid
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need this kind of information for a whole lot of
purposes,'' said Penn State professor John Lucas, a historian who
has written four books on the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Journalists and historians are far apart in a number of
things, but they are both investigators seeking the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The unseen material might even conclude sponsorship contracts
and television rights negotiations, which have long been
top-secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to weigh the affect of it vs. the good that would
come from disclosure,'' said a seemingly unconcerned International
Olympic Committee vice president Dick Pound, whose organization has
thrown back the curtain on its own inner workings. ``If it is just
disclosure for prurient interest, there is no good that comes of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, historians and journalists will find a slightly
censored truth. The Olympic bid team, headed by attorney Payne and
former Mayor Andrew Young, is holding back eight legal-size boxes
that they claim contain personal and sensitive papers. Copies of
those documents and others have been handed over to federal
investigators looking for any signs of corruption in the Atlanta
bid.
</P>
<P>
   Payne's decision to release the lion's share of records is an
attempt to calm the controversy over his group's campaign for the
Games. The Salt Lake City bribery scandal _ in which that city's
ambitious bid team showered IOC members with more than $1 million
in gifts and favors _ turned the spotlight on Olympic candidate
cities everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Investigations into the Olympic city selection process were
conducted by four bodies _ the IOC, the U.S. Olympic Committee,
Congress and the Justice Department. The results haven't been
pretty. The IOC has been painted as a club of corrupt and greedy
prima donnas, the bid cities as pawns willing to grease the
members' outstretched palms for a chance at the golden ring.
</P>
<P>
   Payne and his team of lawyers have denied wrongdoing and
expressed indignation toward any questions about the gifts and
entertainment they bestowed upon visiting IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not bribe anyone,'' Payne said in February as he
prepared a response to an IOC inquiry. ``We were not extorted by
IOC members. We did not make cash payments. We did not give
outrageous gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a formal report in March, Payne argued that his bid was
above reproach: Any excessive gifts were tokens of friendship, not
bribes; excessive visits to the city were extensions of Southern
hospitality, not an attempt to win favors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta won the games `fair and square' in an honorable
manner,'' Payne wrote in a letter to Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the IOC was ousting 10 members accused of taking bribes
from Salt Lake bidders, Payne promised that the exiled members were
on good behavior in Atlanta. ``They were nice people,'' Payne said.
``They were our friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Payne for months refused to allow the media access to the
bid team records that could verify his claims. Everything of
historical significance would be cataloged and archived at the
Atlanta History Center and released in due time. The remainder _
donor lists, personal correspondence and memos that might prove
embarassing to the authors _ would be boxed up and kept from public
view forever, he hoped.
</P>
<P>
   The cloak of secrecy was warranted, Payne's lawyers contend. The
non-profit Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation (GAAF), formed to
seek the bid, was a group of private, civic-minded volunteers
acting without authority from the city and state in their effort to
win the Games.

A FRENCH TWIST FOR FINAL AT CARNOUSTIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ It was a spectacular round of golf,
almost stunning considering the difficulty of the golf course, the
magnitude of the tournament, and the player who did it. Jean Van de
Velde, a 33-year-old Frenchman who has not won on the European Tour
since 1993, played the round of his life at Carnoustie Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing rattled Van de Velde, not the pressure of leading a
major, not the marquee names on the leader board like Tiger Woods,
Greg Norman and Justin Leonard, and not the intimidating aura of
one of the world's most difficult golf courses. When he hit into
trouble, Van de Velde escaped with the smoothness of a magician.
Whenever someone threatened his lead, Van de Velde counterpunched
with a timely shot. And when the day was over, Van de Velde was on
the brink of glory.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a one-under-par 70, and taking a five-stroke lead into
the final round, Van de Velde stood at even par for the tournament
(213), five strokes ahead of Leonard, who shot a 71 Saturday, and
Craig Parry, who shot a 67, the best round of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Woods made a costly double-bogey at No. 17 and was
seven strokes behind, tied with Andrew Coltart and David Frost.
Norman, who bogeyed the final two holes, was eight strokes behind
after Saturday's 75, tied with Angel Cabrera, who started the day
in second place but struggled to a 77. But the man of the moment
was Van de Velde, who has the largest third-round lead at any major
since Woods led the 1997 Masters by nine strokes after three
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Can Van de Velde avoid a Sunday collapse? And what thoughts
would be going through his mind Saturday night?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have about 24 hours to think, which is too many,'' admitted
Van de Velde, who held the biggest third-round lead at the British
Open since 1996, when Tom Lehman went on to win after leading by
six strokes. ``I know many golfers greater than me have been in
this position and lost. I am going to enjoy it, play the golf
course, and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   And when it was pointed out that Van de Velde had not won since
1993, he smiled and said, ``Maybe it's time I won one.''
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde played with remarkable poise, making extraordinary
recovering shots and long-distance putts. He ended the round in
glorious fashion, making a 45-foot putt for birdie at No. 18 that
brought a deafening roar from the grandstand, as he took off his
hat and acknowledged the ovation.
</P>
<P>
   That was the last sparkling moment of a day filled with them.
Van de Velde also made a 70-foot birdie putt at No. 14, and a
25-foot birdie putt at No. 7. As athletes say, Van de Velde was in
the zone, and almost everything he did turned out right.
</P>
<P>
   Carnoustie rarely allows any golfer to miss fairways
consistently yet shoot under par. But in the calmest weather
conditions of the tournament, Van de Velde found a way, hitting
aggressively and sometimes wildly off the tee, yet relying on his
short game to get up and down. Van de Velde made unlikely par saves
at No. 10 and No. 11 that kept his momentum going. After he hit his
drive on No. 10 into a bunker, Van de Velde blasted out short of
the green, hit a wedge shot to 18 feet, then made another key put.
</P>
<P>
   And his save at No. 11 was more remarkable. After hitting a
terrible drive far right into the rough, Van de Velde feared he had
hit out of bounds, and actually teed up another ball for another
tee shot. But a spotter waved to Van de Velde from the fairway that
his ball was playable, so Van de Velde walked to his ball, where a
television tower blocked his path back the fairway. Van de Velde
asked an official for relief, and he was allowed to move his ball
several feet to the right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked, `What happens if I kill a cameraman?''' said Van de
Velde, showing the sense of humor that has helped him calm his
nerves. Then after hitting back into the fairway, Van de Velde hit
his approach shot to around 14 feet, then made still another putt.
</P>
<P>
   And while Van de Velde consistently made great things happen,
his pursuers could not. Woods shot a three-over par 74, and two
holes badly hurt him. At the par-5 No. 14, Woods reached the green
in two shots and had a 35-foot putt for eagle. At that point, Woods
was only three strokes behind. But he left the eagle attempt 6 feet
short, then missed the 6-foot birdie attempt as well, settling for
par. Then at the par-4 No. 17, Woods drove into the right rough,
hacked out short of the fairway and hit his approach shot over the
green. He left his next chip short of the green, then finally
chipped onto the green and made a putt for a double-bogey six.
</P>
<P>
   Woods believed he could still win, but he also knew that seven
strokes was a huge deficit, even at Carnoustie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be awfully tough to catch him,'' Woods said of
Van de Velde. ``Myself and others who are in the hunt need to play
a great round. If I can post a good number early, you never know
what could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Parry and Leonard had the same thoughts. And Leonard, the 1997
British Open champion, is definitely someone to watch. Leonard has
won three tournaments after trailing by five strokes entering the
final round _ the 1997 British Open, the 1997 Kemper Open and the
Players Championship last year. Instead of complaining about
Carnoustie's conditions, Leonard has concentrated on overcoming
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go out there and deal with it,'' said Leonard, who planned to
take that same approach Sunday. ``The goal tomorrow is to go out
and give myself chances.''
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday belonged to Van de Velde. And on Sunday, he would
find out if the British Open championship would belong to him as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest tournament in the world,'' he said. ``What
can happen? I can win it. I can lose it. Either way, I'm having a
good time.''

<P>
   Petite Pedro Martinez takes his next step today in his 30-win
quest, with his first start of the second half, against Florida. A
remarkable year raises two questions: How did he get here and what
lies before him?
</P>
<P>
   From a Los Angeles operating room to a New York state jail cell,
the answers to those two items have been clarified. L.A. orthopedic
surgeon Frank Jobe confirmed last week that he advised the Los
Angeles Dodgers that Martinez was an injury waiting to happen,
which expedited his trade to Montreal and subsequent stardom.
</P>
<P>
   And from jail, where he is serving an eight-year sentence for
embezzlement, Denny McLain, the game's last 30-game winner, is
wondering if the five-man rotation provides the contemporary
pitcher any real opportunity to reach 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so difficult to win 30 now because you don't pitch
enough,'' McLain said. ``I made 41 or 42 starts. A few of those
came on two days' rest.''
</P>
<P>
   No one said it was going to be easy.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Dodgers general manager Fred Claire quietly bore the
responsibility for dealing Martinez in 1994, for second baseman
Delino DeShields, in what became one of the stupidest deals the
Dodgers ever made. Manager Tommy Lasorda would trust him only as a
reliever, and, even though he made 65 appearances in his last
Dodger season, the club never could convince itself that Martinez's
slim build allowed for a starter's durability.
</P>
<P>
   But now Jobe, one of sports' pre-eminent surgeons, told the Los
Angeles Times that he was advising Claire all along that the little
Dominican was destined for ruin. Martinez separated his left,
non-throwing shoulder while swinging a bat in the on-deck circle in
Albuquerque in 1992, and after Jobe repaired it he became dubious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The circumstances kind of spoke for themselves,'' he said.
``His shoulder had come out once, and once an injury of that type
occurs, you can't say it won't reoccur. He had kind of a delicate
stature to start with, and there were already questions about his
stamina. It's a judgment call, but you had to kind of wonder,
`Golly, is this kid going to break down?'''
</P>
<P>
   Shipped to the Expos, he became a starter, made 117 starts in a
row, won the 1997 Cy Young and is producing one of the best seasons
of the latter half of the century in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those people who put all those labels on me must be out
there now banging their heads against the wall,'' Martinez said.
``You're talking about some of the biggest people in baseball, but
they obviously didn't know anything about the game. They were still
saying I was too small, too weak, certain to break down. I think
about it all the time. It's still my motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   McLain has no doubts about Martinez's ability, saying he ``has
as good of stuff as anybody who has played this game.'' But while
the starter of the 1990s works 35-36 games a year _ and Martinez
might start just 33 games _ anyone chasing a 30-win year now is at
a disadvantage. McLain started 41 games in 1968, winning 31 times.
He threw a career-high 336 innings that season.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's career high is 241, in his final season in Montreal.
While he long ago answered the durability questions, the Red Sox
nevertheless are trying to protect him by moving him to the back of
the rotation, which is giving him an 11-day break around the
All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   McLain was having so much fun in 1968, no one ever stopped to
count the pitches. He became a celebrity and rubbed elbows with
Hollywood. He still recalls the day Ed Sullivan walked into the
Tigers clubhouse when they were in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   McLain said, ``We almost all fell off our chairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Sullivan. Another thing Martinez doesn't have to contend
with.

NEW JERSEY TROOPERS RALLY TO RESIST CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ As Gov. Christie Whitman has struggled to change
the racially discriminatory culture of the state police, she has
run into a surprisingly stubborn obstacle, the agency's steadfast
support among white New Jersey residents.
</P>
<P>
   During the past 16 months, the image of the state police has
been tarnished by a barrage of embarrassing revelations that might
have doomed a less resilient agency to a furious public backlash
and a thorough house-cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   There have been widely publicized allegations that troopers
illegally singled out black and Hispanic civilians, a questionable
shooting in which troopers wounded three unarmed minority men
during a traffic stop, and a Justice Department investigation into
discriminatory practices. The former superintendent, Col. Carl
Williams, was fired by Whitman in February for making racially
insensitive comments.
</P>
<P>
   Even the governor, who was initially skeptical of some
complaints against the troopers, conducted her own inquiry and
eventually concluded that some officers routinely discriminated
against minority civilians and co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many New Jersey residents and elected officials still sing
the police force's praises with an almost patriotic fervor. Recent
public opinion polls have shown surprisingly little erosion in that
support. State legislators, who watch those polls closely and are
mindful of the troopers' political influence, have rallied to the
troopers' defense.
</P>
<P>
   The week before last, the state Senate's vocal opposition to
appointing any outsider to the superintendent's job scared off the
governor's top choice, Col. Andre Parker of the Illinois State
Police, a man who had revamped other troubled police forces.
Parker, 43, would have become the state's first black
superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general is scheduled to conduct a final round
of interviews with the remaining contenders, including some
additional outside candidates. But it would be politically perilous
for the governor to choose a superintendent committed to radical
change or ousting the entrenched commanders who for years tolerated
discrimination. The governor herself acknowledged that an outside
candidate would face a tough confirmation fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes from a deep sense of respect for the men and women of
the state police,'' Whitman said recently. ``And I think it's a bit
of an ill-founded feeling that if you go outside the state police
you are somehow repudiating the good men and women of that
organization. Because in no way is it a repudiation if that's what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly unusual for communities to glorify their police
forces. Since the crack cocaine wars of the 1980s, there has been a
surge in public support across the country for tougher laws and
larger, more aggressive, law-enforcement agencies. Within New
Jersey's borders, however, the state police are showered with such
torrents of adulation that one might think they deserved credit for
every law-enforcement innovation since the billy club.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, many legislators, even some people within the
attorney general's office who have publicly criticized the state
police, almost reflexively refer to the troopers as ``the premier
law-enforcement agency in the nation.'' Rarely do they explain
whether those accolades are based on anything beyond civic pride.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, many law-enforcement experts consider the New Jersey
State Police a solid agency that, racial problems aside, does a
commendable job. But few experts use superlatives to describe its
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University,
said he had never heard it cited as an example of a cutting-edge,
or unusually effective, police force. ``But innovation and
productivity aren't what make the public support their police
force,'' he said. ``The public is more concerned about whether
officers are nice to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although only a limited number of the 2,700 officers have been
involved in racial profiling or questionable shootings, more than a
dozen current and former troopers have filed lawsuits charging that
racial slurs, selective enforcement of the law, biased hiring and
promotion practices and sexual harassment are tolerated, and often
encouraged, by supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitman administration's inquiry also found that the police
force's secretive Internal Affairs Bureau was so unresponsive to
civilian complaints that some officers smugly refused to even take
reports of misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   But public opinion polls taken this spring by The Star-Ledger of
Newark and the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University
found enduring public support for the state police. Among black
residents, who make up 14 percent of the state's population, 31
percent felt that the police were doing an admirable job, down from
56 percent a year earlier. Fully 84 percent of white residents said
the department was doing a good or excellent job, virtually
unchanged from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights leaders say that dichotomy is not surprising, given
the state's racial divisions. The Rev. Reginald Jackson, director
of the Black Ministers' Council of New Jersey, said that some white
residents sincerely believe the stereotype that blacks are more
likely to carry illegal narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   And in many rural towns, which are predominantly white, the
state police are the only law-enforcement agency, so residents have
only benign encounters with troopers who direct traffic and keep
the peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not affecting them personally, so they don't view it as a
problem for them,'' Jackson said. ``And they don't understand how
demeaning it is to be considered a criminal simply because of the
color of your skin.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts believe that the public allegiance to
the troopers is also an outgrowth of New Jersey's inferiority
complex, the sense that many state residents often feel
overshadowed by New York and unfairly maligned by the media. Gerald
Pomper, a professor of political science at Rutgers, said some New
Jerseyans embrace their civic institutions as a way of affirming
their state identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though New Jersey has overcome a lot of the unfair
wisecracks in the past 20 years, and started to develop a sense of
state pride, people here still resent attacks on state
institutions,'' Pomper said. ``And they resent the idea that we
might need an outsider to come in to fix things, as if the state
can't handle its own problems from within.''
</P>
<P>
   The public's eagerness to forgive the troopers and put the issue
to rest has limited the governor's options. The most telling aspect
of the legislature's resistance to Parker's nomination was its
spontaneity. Although the police union donates considerable sums of
money and campaign help to elected officials, legislators insist
that the outpouring of solidarity was not the product of lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state police don't have to lobby much,'' said one
Democratic legislator. ``They usually get their way simply by
asking.''
</P>
<P>
   That instinctive reaction to stand by the men in blue and gold
leaves the governor in an uncomfortable position. By vowing to
correct the department's discriminatory culture, she has staked her
reputation on her ability to enact meaningful reforms.
</P>
<P>
   In order to succeed, she must first win over the senators who
can reject her nominee for superintendent, and avoid alienating the
pro-trooper voters whose support she will need next year in her
race for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But that will only be possible if the governor can convince the
public that the best way to show admiration for an institution is
to confront its problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say there are areas where we don't need change is to ignore
the obvious,'' Whitman said at a recent news conference. ``But we
are determined to change this.''

 &HT;    HYANNISPORT STUNNED BY NEWS OF MISSING PLANE
 &HT;    With KENNEDY-SEARCH.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HYANNISPORT, Mass. _ On a sparkling summer Saturday, with
breezes beckoning on the bay and white beaches glistening in the
sunshine, shock and sorrow beset this Cape Cod village as tragedy
again struck its most famous family.
</P>
<P>
   Gathering outside the Kennedy family compound, neighbors and
tourists alike whispered, ``no, not again,'' as they exchanged
increasingly gloomy tidbits of news about the missing plane
carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, Carolyn, and her sister,
Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the post office picking up my mail when I heard what
happened,'' said Phyllis Kahn, who has a summer home near the
cluster of white clapboard houses where the Kennedy clan gathers in
times of joy and sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is along my usual walk and I was going home, but you get
transfixed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the barricades, a tent could be seen where the wedding of
his cousin, Rory Kennedy, was to have been celebrated Saturday
evening. Family members instead planned to attend a Catholic mass.
</P>
<P>
   Neither grief nor gladness are strangers to this picturesque
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know Ethel Kennedy was pregnant with Rory when Robert
Kennedy (Rory's father) was killed,'' said Helene Schechter, who
was visiting the Kahns. ``And you know this weekend was the 30th
anniversary of Chappaquiddick,'' the incident in which a young
campaign worker drowned in a car driven by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kennedy compound, there are at least three houses. One,
called the Ambassador's House, was owned originally by Joseph
Kennedy Sr., the family patriarch, passed to his widow, Rose, and
is now owned by Edward Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Another, owned by the late Robert F. Kennedy, is now owned by
his widow. A third was owned by President John F. Kennedy and was
passed on to John Kennedy Jr. and his sister, Caroline.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the town, the news of another seeming Kennedy tragedy
cast a pall on the pleasures of a summer weekend.
</P>
<P>
   At the Four Seas ice cream shop, where three generations of
Kennedy children have charged double cones, the tragedy was the
center of conversation among customers in shorts, T-shirts and
bathing suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come in, sit down, and immediately ask if we know
anything,'' said employee Pat McEvoy.
</P>
<P>
   At the Four Seas, John Jr. inherited his mother's fondness for
the homemade peach ice cream. Jacqueline Kennedy would order the
flavor delivered to the compound when her husband was president and
served it at a prenuptial dinner for her daughter Caroline.
</P>
<P>
   Family members have come into the store since before John
Kennedy was president and always charge their purchases, because
they rarely carry cash, said manager Jahni(cq) Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   At the John F. Kennedy Memorial, a grassy park where a stone
wall bearing a bronze relief of the late president overlooks the
sparkling blue Hyannis harbor, visitors spoke quietly of a family
besieged by sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's just because they're in the news, and other large
families have many tragedies, too, but I just feel so sorry for
them,'' said Terri Wirtz, visiting with her husband, Joe, from
Epsom, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew up during the Kennedy era,'' she said. ``I just wanted
to say a prayer for their family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We hadn't planned to come, but it was like the car just took
us here,'' said Diane Seiter, who was at the memorial with her
husband, Tom, and their three children. ``We had to come out of
respect and for a quick prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Visiting from Florence, Ky., the Seiters heard the report of the
missing plane on their car radio. ``It sent a chill up my spine,''
said Mrs. Seiter, 35. ``We've been giving our children a history of
the Kennedy family going back to Joe Sr. _ who they are and all
they've done.''

<P>
   Nearly every Oriole trade bait
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Orioles will listen to inquiries about anyone,
except Cal Ripken and Mike Mussina, but with two motivations.
General manager Frank Wren, back on owner Peter Angelos' good side,
has persuaded the owner to dismantle the O's calcified roster.
</P>
<P>
   However, the team needs to dump some of the players just to get
rid of the contracts. Long-term deals granted to six players are
worth about $150 million through 2003, tying up the club's ability
to maneuver in the free-agent market. Those O's Wren will take
offers for are Scott Erickson, B.J. Surhoff, Brady Anderson, Harold
Baines, Mike Bordick, Juan Guzman, Arthur Rhodes and Jesse Orosco.
Albert Belle would be in there, too, but he has a no-trade clause,
as well as dubious appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing to remember,'' Wren said, ``is that we don't have to
trade anyone right now, even if we decide to begin building for our
future. That can be done after the season, also.''...
</P>
<P>
   Doctors tell designated hitter Jose Canseco he can return Sept.
1, but a second back operation in three years has driven the
slugger to the brink of retirement, even though Tampa Bay has an
option year at $3 million for next season. ``I compare it to a
high-speed performance car. One spark plug is loose, and the whole
thing can't function,'' Canseco said. ``I've had the worst luck. I
keep myself in tremendous condition, but I've been jinxed no matter
what I do.''

<P>
   Coomer, Fisk complete circle
</P>
<P>
   While growing up in Lockport, Ill., Ron Coomer was a schoolmate
of the Fisk boys, but it was their father, Carlton Fisk, then
catching his final seasons with the White Sox, who had a more
lasting effect. Coomer met the future Hall of Famer at his
graduation party, was tutored by Fisk on how to hit with a wooden
bat and so impressed the catcher that seven years later, after
Coomer was released by Oakland, Fisk got the White Sox to pick him
up.
</P>
<P>
   Coomer moved on twice before settling with Minnesota, but the
circle was closed Tuesday when Coomer came to the plate in his
first All-Star Game and Fisk, the honorary captain, was down in the
AL first base coaching box, yelling at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have had a job without Carlton,'' Coomer said.
``Now we're golfing buddies, and he's always trying to get into my
pocket.''...
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's old guard is on the way out. The club will move
Kevin Appier this month, and Jeff Montgomery is in the Gulf Coast
League trying to rehab from tendinitis in his pelvis. He is three
saves away from 300, but Mongomery said, ``Right now, that's the
furthest thing from my mind. I'm assuming it will never
happen.''... Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove has reconsidered using
Jim Thome at third base until Travis Fryman gets back. Sub third
baseman Enrique Wilson recently hit .405 over 22 games, making
Hargrove's decision less urgent.

   Brawl still hurting Mariners
</P>
<P>
   It will be weeks before the Seattle Mariners get over their
brawl in Los Angeles in the final game before the break. Outfielder
Brian Hunter is on the disabled list with a wrenched knee sustained
that day, and outfielder Charles Gipson dislocated his shoulder
when the pile he was in shifted.
</P>
<P>
   To fill out the roster, the club had to take Jay Buhner off the
disabled list before it would like to. Buhner has been out since
May 19 with a bad hamstring and he jeopardizes the rest of the
season if he pulls it again. But then again, Buhner might have to
sit for a while longer, because he is subject to suspension for
joining the brawl. Players on the disabled list are restricted from
entering the field during a game.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner waded in to rescue Gipson and wound up putting ex-Brave
Pedro Borbon in a headlock. ``That wasn't me out there,'' he said.
``That was (pro wrestler) Steve Austin coming off the
turnbuckle.''...
</P>
<P>
   Oakland continues to listen to offers for left-hander Kenny
Rogers, but given the close quarters in the division standings, the
A's can't trade their No. 1 starter while still in contention.
``Kenny ain't going nowhere unless we really stink,'' right fielder
Matt Stairs said.... Texas' Ivan Rodriguez, who caught all but 66
2/3 of the Rangers' 767 2/3 innings _ 91 percent _ in the first
half, continues to overwork himself. His career batting average
before the All-Star break is .317; after the break, it's .272.

   Mets eye Marlins' Hernandez
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets' shopping list includes Seattle's Jeff Fassero
and Oakland's Kenny Rogers as the club tries to shore up its
rotation. But the first name is Livan Hernandez, for whom Florida
is entertaining offers. He comes cheap ($1.575 million this year,
ineligible for arbitration for another season), he's pitched in big
games before and foremost, he works into the late innings, which
the Mets overtaxed bullpen loves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we need rest in the bullpen,'' said reliever
Turk Wendell, ``but if the starters went a little deeper, it would
give the bullpen some breathing room.''
</P>
<P>
   Injuries prompted the Mets to use eight starters in the first
half. In their first 89 games, those starters lasted five or fewer
innings 30 times.... Mike Schmidt, the former Phillies third
baseman named to game's greatest 100 players list, fears what havoc
the game's offensive boom will make of the game's history book.
``When I'm 70, 80 years old, I'm going to be ashamed to admit I'm
in that pitiful, little 500-home run club when there are 30 guys in
the 800-home run club,'' Schmidt said.... Asked if he was
disappointed he didn't get to pitch in the All-Star Game, Phillie
Paul Byrd shook his head and said, ``I would have been the batboy
if they asked me to be.''

   Mum to mom on Gooden tiff
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell Pokey Reese's mother what happenend the other night
when Cincinnati was playing Cleveland. Doc Gooden struck out Reese
and the two glared each other down before Reese went to the dugout
and all the Reds second baseman could hope was his mom wasn't
watching back in Columbia, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big deal, he struck me out.... yeah,'' Reese said. ``But I
ain't gonna fight with a Hall of Famer. Besides, my mom might kill
me. Gooden is her favorite player. She used to live in Flushing and
had season tickets at Shea in 1986. When Cleveland was at our place
this year, I got him to sign a ball for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooden later called the Reds clubhouse to apologize to Reese and
said the incident was a heat-of-battle deal. Reese later asked if
the game had been televised anywhere near South Carolina and
informed it wasn't, said, ``Good, I'm not going to tell her about
this.''...
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee's Jeromy Burnitz may have opened some eyes during the
All-Star Game but not for Chicago manager Jim Riggleman, who
bubbled over the guy. ``People just don't know how good he is,''
said Riggleman. ``He's a good outfielder, he plays hard, he's
aggressive. And it looks like he enjoys the game.''... To reach 90
wins, Riggleman's Cubs need a 49-28 (.630) record in the second
half.... Kent Bottenfield is averaging just over six innings a
start and has a shot at being the first St. Louis pitcher to win 20
games with less than 200 innings.

<P>
   Giants slow rousing from break
</P>
<P>
   For the 10th time since leaving the Polo Grounds in 1957, the
San Francisco Giants opened the second half in first place. History
says the struggle has just begun. In just four of those 10 seasons
did the Giants finish in first, and lately, late July has almost
killed the season.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Giants lost seven of their first 10 post-break
games but managed to win the division by two games. Last year, a
2-11 start presaged the loss of the one-game playoff with Chicago.
How the next two weeks go should dictate how aggressively general
manager Brian Sabean adjusts his roster. A healthy Barry Bonds
might define the difference of the two halves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we start the second half like we have in the past, God
forbid, we might have more necessity,'' Sabean said. ``We're all
hoping we don't have to make any moves, and if we do it'd be a
tweak here and there.''...
</P>
<P>
   Painful note: within Arizona's Randy Johnson's winless streak,
he has struck out 60 batters in 41 innings, posted an 0.87 ERA and
not won.... Brian Bohanon's crunchy left elbow has forced
Colorado's Jim Leyland to revert to a five-man rotation. Bohanon's
workload is limited by bone chips
</P>
<P>
   in the elbow, good news for rookie Roberto Ramirez, who joins
the rotation full time. He is in for hazardous duty. Over the first
half, Rockies starters were 27-35 with a 6.42 ERA.

 &HT;    Odds and ends from Major League Baseball
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   U-S-A, U-S-A
</P>
<P>
   Not everywhere has women's sport made inroads. When the score of
the U.S.-China World Cup championship game was posted on the
scoreboard at 3Com Park last Sunday, San Francisco's Jeff Kent
stepped out of the batter's box while the crowd cheered and began
the obligatory ``U-S-A'' chant. Out on the mound, St. Louis's Ricky
Bottalico got chafed. ``Why didn't they wait until the end of the
inning?'' Bottalico asked. ``We've got a baseball game going on.
That's fine and dandy to put it on the board, but get in the box
and play baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To hell with Bottalico. It's my at-bat,'' Kent replied. ``I
was pondering the victory of girls soccer. He should be thinking
the same thing. He must not be very USA-proud.''
</P>
<P>
   MANNY AND HACK
</P>
<P>
   Manny Ramirez's 96 RBIs at the break is not the highest
first-half total, but it's close. He has to drive in 98 more runs
in his final 75 game to catch Hack Wilson, who drove in 191 RBIs in
1930. The biggest RBI totals at the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   CHILL OUT
</P>
<P>
   Tim Flannery, third-base coach for San Diego who was invited by
Bruce Bochy to Boston to help coach the National League All-Stars,
had thrown batting practice Monday and was ready to call it a
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in there after batting practice, icing down, eating about
two dozen clams and sippin' on a Guinness,'' Flannery said. ``Mark
McGwire comes up to me before the Home Run Derby and says he
doesn't have a guy to pitch to him. I don't know what happened to
the guy who was supposed to throw, but I start thinking: `Irish guy
hitting, Irish guy throwing, Irish beer, Irish city. Gotta be.
Gotta do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Did it maybe too well. After McGwire's cannonade in the first
round _ 16 swings, 13 home runs _ the two Irishmen could not keep
up the pace. McGwire was eliminated by Milwaukee's Jeromy Burnitz
in the second round. But for all the marveling going on at Fenway
Park that night, Flannery led both leagues. ``I stopped after six
and looked out into center field,'' Flannery said. ``My son (Danny)
was out there shagging balls. I felt so proud, and it made me think
of my father.''
</P>
<P>
   Ragon Flannery, his father, had died five days earlier after a
long fight with Alzheimer's disease.

   Tragedy has struck the Kennedy family many times since the
1940s.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rosemary, the eldest daughter of Joseph P. Kennedy and Rose
Fitzgerald Kennedy, was mentally retarded and underwent a failed
lobotomy in 1941. After the operation, she no longer recognized her
father. She lived privately at a Catholic institution in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   _ Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr., the eldest child of Joe and Rose
Kennedy, a Navy pilot stationed in Great Britain in 1944, died on a
dangerous secret mission, flying a plane full of explosives in an
attempt to destroy a Nazi missile site. The plane exploded in
midair before its crew could jump to safety.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1948, Kathleen Kennedy, the fourth Kennedy child, was
flying from Paris to Cannes with Lord Peter Fitzwilliam, whom she
intended to marry, when their De Havilland crashed in severe
weather. Both were killed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Joseph P. Kennedy, the family patriarch, suffered a
debilitating stroke in 1961, just a few months after his son, John
F. Kennedy, was inaugurated as president. He lived until 1969 but
never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   _ John F. Kennedy, the second Kennedy child and the 35th
president of the United States, was assassinated by Lee Harvey
Oswald on Nov. 22, 1963.
</P>
<P>
   _ Edward M. Kennedy, the youngest Kennedy son, broke his back in
a plane accident in 1964, seven months after his brother was
killed. He recovered.
</P>
<P>
   _ On June 6, 1968, Robert F. Kennedy, the third Kennedy son, who
was running for president, was shot by Sirhan Sirhan, just after
claiming victory in the California primary. He died 20 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the night of July 18-19, 1969, Edward M. Kennedy flew to
Martha's Vineyard to sail in a regatta and to attend a party with
several women who had been Robert's campaign aides. He left with
one of them, Mary Jo Kopechne. He drove off a bridge on
Chappaquiddick Island and she drowned. The episode has shadowed his
political career.
</P>
<P>
   _ Edward Kennedy Jr., the son of Edward and Joan Kennedy, had
his leg amputated for cancer on Nov. 18, 1973. He recovered and is
now a lawyer in New Haven, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   _ David Kennedy, the troubled 28-year-old son of Robert and
Ethel Kennedy, died of a drug overdose in Palm Beach, Fla., on
April 25, 1984. He had been watching his father on television in
1968 when Robert Kennedy was shot.
</P>
<P>
   _ Michael Kennedy, another of Robert and Ethel's children, was
killed on Dec. 31, 1997, in a bizarre skiing accident. The
39-year-old skied into a tree in Aspen, Colo., while playing a game
of ski football. His youngest sister, Rory, who had planned to
marry Saturday, unsuccessfully gave him mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: A STORY OF `BLOWBACK' IN PARADISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVEN R. WEISMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Under pressure from the United States and some of its own close
allies, Pakistan has apparently brought about the withdrawal of the
insurgents who infiltrated into India last spring to support the
uprising in the disputed region of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   What no doubt must have initially seemed like a good idea to
Pakistan's military turned into an embarrassing blunder. Last year,
India looked like the neighborhood bully when it tested a nuclear
weapon. Now it is Pakistan that is seen as the aggressor.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, has relearned an old
lesson in South Asia: encouraging insurgencies in a neighboring
country can backfire. By intervening in India, Pakistan was widely
condemned. By retreating, Pakistan has invited internal instability
as religious fundamentalists, army dissidents and others mobilize
against Sharif's regime.
</P>
<P>
   It is an old story. Back in the 1970s, Pakistan first began
encouraging Islamic fundamentalist guerrillas in Afghanistan in
retaliation for Afghan support for insurgents in the Pakistani
province of Baluchistan.
</P>
<P>
   After the Russian invasion of Afghanistan in 1980, the CIA and
Saudi Arabia joined with Pakistan to support the rebels, eventually
pushing the Russians out. The Afghan war helped bring down the
Soviet Union. It also led Osama bin Laden, who fought with the
Afghan rebels, and his allies to use Afghanistan as a base from
which to wage terrorism around the world. Some of these rebels are
said to be operating in Kashmir, India's only Muslim-dominated
state.
</P>
<P>
   Another case of ``blowback'' from an insurgency occurred after
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India secretly aided Tamil rebels
in the island nation of Sri Lanka, off India's southern coast. In
the 1980s, when her son, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, tried to
suppress the rebels, they turned on him. He was murdered by a Tamil
explosive in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Kashmir is in a class by itself because of its
emotional links to India and Pakistan. As India's founding prime
minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, who was descended from Kashmiri
Brahmins, once declared:
</P>
<P>
   ``Like some supremely beautiful woman, whose beauty is almost
impersonal and above human desire, such was Kashmir in all its
feminine beauty of river and valley and lake and graceful trees.
And then another aspect of this magic beauty would come to view, a
masculine one, of hard mountains and precipices, and snow-capped
peaks and glaciers, and cruel and fierce torrents rushing down to
the valleys below.''
</P>
<P>
   Nehru's desire to keep Kashmir went beyond ancestral, aesthetic
or strategic considerations. It was rooted in his vision of India
as a pluralistic nation, a vision that remains at India's core
today. Among those opposing an independent Muslim nation of
Kashmir, for example, are many of India's 140 million Muslims, who
also fear a Hindu backlash if the rebellion succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   But for Pakistanis, Kashmir also represents a powerful idea of
self-determination. To them, Kashmiris have suffered a bitter life
of poverty and subjugation since the British left the region in
1947. Indeed, in the early 1950s, a U.N. diplomat involved in
mediating the dispute was struck, as many are today, by the
contrast between a sublime landscape and lofty ideas and that
misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only those who have visited Kashmir can see this cruel
contrast between the nostalgic beauty and power of its scenery and
the frightened dark eyes of its countless poor,'' wrote Josef
Korbel, in his book ``Danger of Kashmir.'' Korbel was the father of
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the latest outsider to get
involved in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the merits of self-determination, one reason for the
recent global pressure on Sharif to force the withdrawal of
insurgents from Kashmir is that too many countries do not like the
idea of other countries, even their friends, making mischief on
their neighbors' soil.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan was responding not simply to American pressure, for
example, but to pressure from two close allies, China and Saudi
Arabia. After meeting with President Clinton earlier this month,
Sharif flew to London with the Saudi ambassador to Washington,
Prince Bandar bin Sultan, on a Saudi plane. The Saudis feel too
vulnerable to internal unrest to encourage rebellions in nearby
countries.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Chinese, who rebuffed Sharif after the intervention
in Kashmir this spring, they know that if they encourage an
insurgency in India, India could encourage its many Tibetan
refugees to make trouble for them.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal of the insurgents is likely to serve only as one
more chapter in the Kashmir struggle. Decades ago, Josef Korbel saw
Kashmir as a Cold War arena in danger of becoming a communist
outpost. Today the fear is that without some resolution of the
conflicting ideas, Kashmir could engulf a region in more war and
deprivation, which no amount of beauty could redeem.

LPGA SEEKS SOME OF THE GLAMOUR OF WOMEN'S SOCCER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk ) 
By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. _ Ty Votaw stepped up to the first tee at
Wykagyl Country Club on Wednesday afternoon and eyed the huge crowd
surrounding the tee box, feeling the pressure to strike a solid
drive before the fans that had gathered, a larger group by
multiples than any other gallery that day.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, interspersed with young girls, was not there to see
Votaw play; for that matter, most of the fans in it were not there
to see any of the professional golfers. Votaw, the Ladies
Professional Golf Association commissioner, was seeing close up the
mesmerizing effect of the U.S. Women's soccer team, as he joined
Mia Hamm and Julie Foudy in his foursome at Wednesday's Pro-Am at
the Japan Airlines Big Apple Classic.
</P>
<P>
   While the LPGA will celebrate its 50th anniversary next year,
the soccer team was involved in a whirlwind week that dwarfed the
attention that the venerable golf circuit has drawn. All the hard
work that Votaw and the LPGA players put in to try to increase the
visibility of the tour seemed lost as the soccer players drew far
more interest than the golfers, with even the golfers waiting
patiently for autographs of Hamm, Foudy and Brandi Chastain.
</P>
<P>
   But Votaw is confident that what was good for women's soccer
last Saturday will be good for all women's sports. Votaw, in his
first year as commissioner after 10 years with the organization,
said he believes that the good fortune that women have enjoyed in
recent years in soccer, basketball and tennis will help the LPGA,
just as the LPGA carved inroads for the other sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have huge gratification and happiness for them,'' Votaw said
of the soccer team's success. ``One of the great things about
women's sports is the sisterhood that goes on. The fact that a
women's sport is on the cover of Time, People and Newsweek in one
week, it's wonderful. One of the best things that happened to the
LPGA was when the University of Connecticut with Rebecca Lobo went
undefeated and it showed broadcasters that women's sports telecasts
could be successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe a rising tide lifts all ships. Do I have a jealousy
of the soccer team? No. Envy? Perhaps. Would I love that exposure?
Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Exposure has been part of the battle that the LPGA fights, as it
has to buy airtime to broadcast its tournaments on the networks,
and lacks a marquee player like Mia Hamm. The soccer team was
planted in the public consciousness by advertising campaigns by
Nike, something the LPGA has yet to have.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one code we need to crack,'' Votaw said. ``You look at
Juli Inkster and her sponsors, Snackwells, Subaru and Izod _ all
took out full-page ads congratulating her. But there are things
that would fit in televised ads. That's the next step. We have to
ride the wings of other people's spending. David Stern of the NBA
is the most brilliant commissioner in sports, but he benefited from
Nike using Michael Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   The LPGA, with its players taking turns at the top, has had no
clear-cut star to market. Inkster has had a spectacular season
after a long period during which she raised two children, but that
story does not draw young girls to the sport as the soccer team's
success has. Last year's rookie of the year, Se Ri- pak, has become
a huge star in Korea, but has not blossomed here, struggling with
her game and success early this season before recovering in the
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Karrie Webb, Annika Sorenstam and Meg Mallon, some of the other
top players on the tour, have yet to be lifted onto the magic
carpet of television ads. The LPGA awaits the advertising bonanza,
while still earning its way into the hearts and minds of television
executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when it comes to the networks, they take the path of
least resistance and the path of least resistance is for us to buy
time,'' Votaw said. ``When I came to the LPGA, all events were time
buys, and some still are today. However, now some are shared risks,
like with ESPN. And with the Golf Channel, they pay us and pay the
production costs. That is progress.''

 WHO'S THAT IN THE FINAL? IT'S CAPRIATI

<TEXT>
<P>
   MAHWAH, N.J. _ In 1990, when she was 14, Jennifer Capriati
became the sensation of tennis. That year, she became the youngest
player to be ranked in the world's top 10, the youngest to be
seeded in a Grand Slam tournament (12th at Wimbledon), the youngest
to win a match at Wimbledon (she got to the fourth round). At 16,
she became the youngest player to reach $1 million in career
earnings. She counted Martina Navratilova, Monica Seles and
Gabriela Sabatini in her victory column.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a sport in which teen-aged prodigies sometimes flame up
and flame out, she flamed out. She was picked up on charges of
substance abuse and shoplifting. She dropped off the tour for more
than two years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, she returned and is just getting back into form. On
Saturday, she took another small step forward by beating Erika
deLone, 7-5, 6-2, in the semifinals of the A&AMP;P Tennis Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Capriati has always been a crowd favorite in this exhibition
tournament, which she won in 1991 and 1993. Her victory put her in
Sunday afternoon's final against the winner of the semifinal
between Amanda Coetzer and Chanda Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   During the sunny, muggy afternoon Saturday, the court
temperature at the Crossroads Corporate Center reached 105 degrees.
The sellout crowd of 7,100 sat through the heat and watched
Capriati, now 23, win in 1 hour 25 minutes. She was the clear
favorite over deLone, who became a semifinalist by winning the
Challengers tournament for lower-ranked players earlier in the
week. Capriati is ranked 43rd, deLone 128th.
</P>
<P>
   In the first set, Capriati fell behind by 4-2 and made too many
unforced errors. As she said later, ``Maybe I just underestimated
her.''
</P>
<P>
   But leading at 6-5, Capriati served out the game and set, helped
by three big first serves. The second set was routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I played well the whole match,'' Capriati said. ``I
want to get back to where I was. Mainly, I want to get better, hit
the ball harder, be more mature, that kind of stuff. I need
consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   Capriati is getting closer. She has won seven career tournament
titles, including one this year in Strasbourg, France. In this
year's French Open, she reached the round of 16 before losing to
Lindsay Davenport. In a six-month span in 1993, she reached the
Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon quarterfinals.  &QL;

OLD GUARD PROVIDES MEDIA COMMENTARY ON JFK JR.'S LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy Jr. may have carved out a niche as a new breed
of Kennedy who eschewed the family calling and published the first
``post-partisan'' magazine of politics. But it was up to the older
journalistic and political hands to bring context and gravity to
news of his missing plane Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the sometimes frantic, sometimes thoughtful wall-to-wall
television coverage that pre-empted network programming in Boston
Saturday, veteran Kennedy watchers from Mike Wallace to Doris
Kearns Goodwin fleshed out the latest chapter in the tragic history
of America's star-crossed political dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   And as a kind of grim family linkage, file footage of John F.
Kennedy Jr.'s famous salute to his father's passing casket in 1963
filled the airwaves, as did references to Kennedy as ``John John,''
a nickname that emanated from the ``Camelot'' days of his father's
prematurely terminated presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In his role as special correspondent to WCVB-TV (Ch. 5),
longtime Boston political observer Clark Booth called the Kennedys
a ``family like no other in American history'' and said news of the
downed plane was ``the stuff of fiction not fact.'' On WBZ-TV (Ch.
4) veteran political correspondent John Henning -- citing
everything from the assasination of President Kennedy to the skiing
accident that claimed Michael Kennedy -- said that every time the
family tries to recover from such a tragedy, ``somebody throws
another thunderbolt at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on CBS from Martha's Vineyard, a clearly distraught
Wallace lent a sense of history to the events by recalling warm
conversations he'd once had with Richard Nixon about President
Kennedy, who defeated Nixon in the very bitter 1960 election. In an
interview with MSNBC's Brian Williams that aired on WHDH-TV (Ch. 7)
inn Boston, historian Doris Kearns Goodwin recounted a poignant
conversation with matriarch Rose Kennedy. Even given the extent of
her family's turmoil, Goodwin noted, Kennedy was sure that her
children and grandchildren ``would still choose to be who they were
because of the adventure, the excitement and the hugeness of the
lives they led.''
</P>
<P>
   The gravity of Saturday's news was apparent early in the morning
when CBS anchor Dan Rather -- who gained fame as the young reporter
who frantically reported word of President Kennedy's November 1963
death in Dallas -- somberly noted that ``tragedy just seems to
follow this family.''
</P>
<P>
   By early afternoon, two of NBC's heaviest hitters, anchor Tom
Brokaw and Washington bureau chief Tim Russert, were trying to fit
John F. Kennedy Jr's life into the family history. Noting that the
young Kennedy had already been approached to run for governor,
senator and mayor of New York, Russert said that ``those closest to
him believed that ultimately, he would find his way back to public
service.''
</P>
<P>
   But reminiscing about the Kennedy legacy -- and thus justifying
the extensive coverage -- proved the easy part of television's task
Saturday. The more difficult challenge was sorting out and making
sense of the fragmentary and unverified information filtering in in
the hours before the fate of Kennedy's plane became clear.
</P>
<P>
   There were numerous stories -- including the presence of a
flight instructor on board -- that were reported and later
corrected during the day. There was considerable confusion over the
possibility of a locator beacon being activated. Shortly after noon
in Boston, when Channel 7 was reporting an active five-state
search, Channel 5 was saying that the search for the plane was
confined largely to the Martha's Vineyard area. At around 12:30,
Channel 7 aired a CNN report that plane debris had been spotted
near the Vineyard only to note a few minutes later that the debris
had actually been sighted near Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The media's ravenous appetite for instant information in a
crisis situation was painfully obvious to viewers who watched
beleaguered Kennedy spokesman Brian O'Connor field questions from
anxious reporters not long after noon. ``I'm sorry, I don't have
much to add,'' he said, in response to the barrage of queries.
``There's just so little information right now.'' At the Pentagon
briefing that begain shortly thereafter, a spokesman told eager
journalists that ``I must remind you that first reports are (often)
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the afternoon dragged on and reports surfaced of luggage
and debris being connected to the downed plane, a sense of
resignation began emerging on the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time goes by, the situation grows more grim,'' declared
Channel 5's Heather Kahn from the studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has turned into a watch now, almost a death watch at the
compound,'' intoned Henning from the Kennedy compound.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most ironic note of the day was struck by Russert,
who explained how John F. Kennedy Jr. hated the idea of the Kennedy
family ``curse'' and particularly disdained the ``notion of wall to
wall media coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now suddenly (he's) the focus of all this media attention,''
on a ``Kennedy curse'' Russert added, explaining that Saturday's
news virtually coincided with the 30th anniversary of
Chappaquidick, when Mary Jo Kopechne died in a car Senator Edward
Kennedy was driving.

AN ALL-TOO-FAMILIAR HEADLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even now, no words prompt so much anguish, so much grief, so
much disbelief as these: John F. Kennedy is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Those words flew around the country Saturday in frantic
electronic pulses, though this time it was not news of the death of
a president but of his son, missing and feared dead after a
small-plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   This time the fragmentary reports did not throw the government
into convulsion. This time the tragedy did not come at a time of
Cold War peril. This time the news will not freeze a nation in a
frightful memory.
</P>
<P>
   But the news that tragedy had apparently struck another Kennedy
_ indeed, a young man bearing the very name of the slain president
_ still had the power to shock a nation that has come to believe it
is all but inured to shock.
</P>
<P>
   Because the fearful phrase _ John F. Kennedy is dead _ has a
special meaning and triggers, for many, a cascade of emotion and
memory: The flag-draped casket. The widow's unfailing courage. The
funeral Mass in St. Matthew's Cathedral. The foghorn voice of the
late Cardinal Richard Cushing. The skirling of the bagpipers from
the Irish Black Watch. The gathering of world leaders from France's
DeGaulle to Canada's Pearson.
</P>
<P>
   And the salute, unbearably brave, of the president's son on the
day he also turned 3 years old.
</P>
<P>
   This is a different time, of course, the assassination of
President Kennedy having heralded an era of violence and senseless
death that dulled the senses. But in corners of America _ in New
England, in pockets of Washington and, it is not to be denied, in
the supermarket checkout lines where the tabloids blare their
headlines _ the Kennedy family still holds a special place.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend after the assassination, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy
told Boston journalist Theodore H. White that the president used to
like to fall asleep to the strains of ``Camelot.'' Of the immediate
family that, for one brief shining moment, symbolized idealism and
inspiration, only one person remains: Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg.
</P>
<P>
   The son, like the father, was given the name of a storied Boston
mayor, John ``Honey Fitz'' Fitzgerald. The son, like the father,
gained fame, in part, because of his unimaginable good looks. The
son, like the father, has lived dangerously, defied conventions,
stoked romantic visions.
</P>
<P>
   Known first as John-John, then as John Kennedy Jr. and finally
simply as John Kennedy, he was the president's son _ but he was
reared by Jacqueline Kennedy Onasis.
</P>
<P>
   She battled to keep him out of the public eye. She fought to
nurture in him grace and etiquette. She taught him how to have a
private life and that it was possible to satisfy only the most
formal obligations of public duty.
</P>
<P>
   So when Mrs. Onasis died in 1994, the son knew _ he was trained
to know _ how to bear grief, how to show dignity, how to express
loss and love. It was apparent that steamy afternoon on the
Virginia hillside as he stood with his sister and uncle, Senator
Edward M. Kennedy, the president's brother, and bid farewell to his
mother in a relentlessly public moment that should, if there were
justice in death, have been intensely private.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth P. O'Donnell, one of the president's closest aides,
wrote a memoir remembered chiefly for its evocative title, taken
from an old ballad: ``Johnny, we hardly knew ye.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell's title was ironic. We knew much about the president _
his distaste for the ballet his wife loved, for example; his
ability to rally bosses like John Bailey and Richard Daley, his
skill at disarming his foes, like the time he told Richard Nixon,
proud of his triumph in the 1959 ``Kitchen Debate'' with Nikita S.
Khruschev, that he knew a lot of men who won debates in the
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   And now we know even more about President Kennedy, or think we
do, much of it sordid.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains true that, of the son, we've hardly known him.
</P>
<P>
   We know, of course, that he was a storied bachelor, that he
teased the women and seduced the camera, that he plotted a romantic
getaway wedding with a breathlessly beautiful woman on a remote
island, that he started a magazine called ``George.''
</P>
<P>
   But we know little else.
</P>
<P>
   All the rest was guesswork. The magazine is light, like the
times, bearing a slightly ironic name, carrying stories that said
very little, oftentimes written by celebrities about celebrities.
The editor has been famously a gadfly, lunching about town, holding
shimmery parties, meeting with Larry Flynt, the renegade
pornography publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Now he may have joined the litany of aunts and uncles and
cousins and parents, all dead before their time.
</P>
<P>
   The witness to all of this is, of course, is Senator Kennedy,
who once again must grieve, who once again must hold the family
together, who once again must stand, solemnly and bravely, at
grave's edge, who once again must, in the words of John F. Kennedy
Jr.'s father, bear the burden.
</P>
<P>
   On days like this, when the sadness and the memories mix, that
burden may simply be beyond measure _ more than he, his family or a
nation can comprehend.
</P>

 &HT;    Television coverage goes into high gear
 &HT;    By Robbyn Footlick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It began, as most unfolding stories do, with few facts
and the opportunity for much speculation _ a potentially dangerous
combination when it comes to live television coverage.
</P>
<P>
   And as the day went on, the best coverage came from the
broadcasters who tempered their reports with repeated warnings that
nothing had been confirmed other than the fact that John F. Kennedy
Jr.'s plane _ with Kennedy, wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and
sister-in-law Lauren Bessette _ had disappeared en route to
Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   With no footage to show for much of the time, the networks that
broke into regular programming and stayed with the story all day _
CNN, ABC, CBS and NBC _ resorted to graphics of the Piper Saratoga
that Kennedy had been piloting and reports from the Kennedy family
compound in Hyannisport and from the New Jersey airport where
Kennedy had taken off.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, there were helicopters filming helicopters hovering
over the choppy waters and sunbathers on the beaches of Martha's
Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Some did it better than others. CNN, whose Martin Savidge went
on the air with the story at 8:29 a.m., went into its usual high
gear, bringing in Frank Sesno later to anchor from Washington and
Daryn Kagan from Atlanta. Sesno brought in correspondent Carl
Rochelle, who usually covers politics but is also a private pilot,
as an expert and CNN producers Peter Dykstra and Michael McManus,
who were vacationing in the Martha's Vineyard area, as reporters.
</P>
<P>
   On all the networks there were phone calls from Kennedy family
friends, contributors to Kennedy's magazine, George, and, of
course, file footage of the glamorous Kennedy couple entering and
exiting buildings and cars, shaking hands with President Clinton
and British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   On CBS, anchor Dan Rather was doing what he does best _ or
worst, depending on preferences _ emoting. He spent more than a few
moments getting visibly misty-eyed as he recounted his meetings

was like.''

 &HT;    Television coverage goes into high gear
 &HT;    By Robbyn Footlick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It began, as most unfolding stories do, with few facts
and the opportunity for much speculation _ a potentially dangerous
combination when it comes to live television coverage.
</P>
<P>
   And as the day went on, the best coverage came from the
broadcasters who tempered their reports with repeated warnings that
nothing had been confirmed other than the fact that John F. Kennedy
Jr.'s plane _ with Kennedy, wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and
sister-in-law Lauren Bessette _ had disappeared en route to
Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   With no footage to show for much of the time, the networks that
broke into regular programming and stayed with the story all day _
CNN, ABC, CBS and NBC _ resorted to graphics of the Piper Saratoga
that Kennedy had been piloting and reports from the Kennedy family
compound in Hyannisport and from the New Jersey airport where
Kennedy had taken off.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, there were helicopters filming helicopters hovering
over the choppy waters and sunbathers on the beaches of Martha's
Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Some did it better than others. CNN, whose Martin Savidge went
on the air with the story at 8:29 a.m., went into its usual high
gear, bringing in Frank Sesno later to anchor from Washington and
Daryn Kagan from Atlanta. Sesno brought in correspondent Carl
Rochelle, who usually covers politics but is also a private pilot,
as an expert and CNN producers Peter Dykstra and Michael McManus,
who were vacationing in the Martha's Vineyard area, as reporters.
</P>
<P>
   On all the networks there were phone calls from Kennedy family
friends, contributors to Kennedy's magazine, George, and, of
course, file footage of the glamorous Kennedy couple entering and
exiting buildings and cars, shaking hands with President Clinton
and British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   On CBS, anchor Dan Rather was doing what he does best _ or
worst, depending on preferences _ emoting. He spent more than a few
moments getting visibly misty-eyed as he recounted his meetings
with Kennedy, including a recent exchange in an Upper East Side
cafe in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   As Kennedy was leaving, Rather said, he walked by Rather's table
and greeted him with a ``smashing smile that could light up a room
or, for that matter, an area code.'' Then, said Rather, his voice
breaking and eyes tearing, ``he went away...That's what (Kennedy)
was like.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Peter Jennings didn't join the ABC coverage until
early in the afternoon; Tom Brokaw began anchoring on NBC just
before.
</P>
<P>
   As coverage continued through the afternoon, the networks made
announcements of programming changes later Saturday night. CNN was
gathering guests for a planned ``Larry King Live'' at 9 p.m., and
Rather announced that ``48 Hours'' planned a special edition
Saturday at 8 p.m.

A FAMOUS NAME, A STRUGGLE WITH CELEBRITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This spring, a tiny college on the eastern shore of Maryland
called John F. Kennedy Jr. to award him an honorary degree for a
service program he had created. Kennedy _ who had spent his life in
the public eye as the embodiment of a nation's loss, the Sexiest
Man in America, and then the most glamorous editor in publishing _
went to Chestertown, Md., to address the 200 graduating seniors at
Washington College.
</P>
<P>
   But as a friend recalled Saturday morning, Kennedy headed back
to New York without the degree.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had not earned it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was nuts,'' said historian Douglas Brinkley, an
associate editor of Kennedy's magazine, George, and a friend since
1990. ``Universities give those out all the time. I thought, that's
ridiculous. There's a lot of people who have done less than him who
would have taken it. But he said, `I don't think I've done anything
to deserve it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy Jr. was born famous, just two weeks after his
father was elected president. He struggled with fame _ but while
others might seek to deflect the attention, friends say, he thought
constantly about deserving it.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the high gloss of celebrity, Brinkley said, there was an
unassuming grace that the public could not access. John F. Kennedy
Jr. did not remember saluting his father's coffin on that day in
1963, but he accepted with equanimity that the moment was part of
the personal imaginative scrapbook for millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   As such, Kennedy lived with scrutiny every day of his life. Who
can forget the lovers' quarrel with his girlfriend in Central Park,
the second failure of the bar exam, or the doomed undergraduate
gesture toward an acting career. When he sprained his ankle this
spring, the alert went out to society columnists all over the
country.
</P>
<P>
   What was remarkable about John F. Kennedy Jr., friends say, was
that he never reveled in the attention, but he never really minded,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``He realized all the gifts he had been given,'' Brinkley said.
``God had given him a great deal. He felt it would be really low
class to whine about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he had expressed no interest in running for office,
Kennedy had an intensifying strain of liberalism that made even
close friends wonder where his career would lead him after George
was on solid footing. Joseph Nye, dean of the Kennedy School, where
Kennedy was poised to take over the chairmanship of the Institute
of Politics, remembers standing next to Kennedy in a receiving line
at a White House dinner and kidding him gently about his
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to him, `Do you remember this place?' and he said,
`Only vaguely,' '' Nye recalled. ``I said, `Do you want to come
back?' And he smiled and said, `Only vaguely.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was born Nov. 25, 1960, the second child of John F.
Kennedy and his wife, Jacqueline. ``John-John,'' as he was dubbed,
mistakenly, by a visiting reporter, was already the nation's
best-known little boy when his father was assassinated in Dallas,
and the wrenching salute that John-John gave to his father's
retreating casket, on the day he turned 3, in a light-blue coat and
short pants, remains one of the impermeable images of that era.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy grew up in Manhattan, living in the household formed
when his mother remarried the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle
Onassis. Jackie Onassis was determined that her children not grow
up removed from everyday life; when John Jr. was mugged in Central
Park, his mother told bodyguards she thought it would be good for
him. He attended Phillips Academy in Andover and Brown University,
and showed talent as an actor that was defeated, ultimately, by the
stony disapproval of his mother.
</P>
<P>
   After passing the bar exam on his third attempt, Kennedy spent
four years in the New York district attorney's office, beginning
with a stint in the special prosecution unit in 1989 and moving on
to try criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   More interesting to the public, during that period, was his
storied love life. John Kennedy Jr.'s bachelorhood in New York was
a tabloid goldmine, as he romanced a series of high-profile blondes
_ including the singer Madonna and film stars Sarah Jessica Parker
and Darryl Hannah _ and disappointed innumerable others. He finally
married his long-term girlfriend Carolyn Bessette, an elegant
former Calvin Klein publicist from Greenwich, Conn., in a private
ceremony on an island off the coast of Georgia on Sept. 21, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he helped launch the magazine George, the glossy
embodiment of his belief that there should be no stark line drawn
between politics and popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kennedy dutifully tried to maintain his father's
legacies. When it was clear she was dying, Jackie Onassis had
entrusted her daughter, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, with
overseeing the Profile in Courage awards at the Kennedy Library,
and John Jr. with stewarding the Kennedy School of Government. His
upcoming position as chairman of the Institute of Politics was
``becoming a burning interest with him,'' said Brinkley. And
Americans had caught a glimpse of what was possible for Kennedy
when he addressed the Atlanta Democratic Convention in 1988,
prompting what William Schneider, a political analyst, later
described as ``an audible gasp.''
</P>
<P>
   But what really captured his imagination was the history of
transportation and folk and blues music. When Brinkley asked him,
once, what his own personal anthem would have been, he immediately
said it would be Bob Dylan's ``Chimes of Freedom'' _ and for a
series of escalating outdoor adventures that culminated in his
recent enthusiasm for flying. His taste ran less to the
rough-and-tumble team sports the Kennedys were best known for than
the solitary extreme ventures: kayaking, parasailing, and, finally,
flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense of testing his limits that was a little like
his father's,'' Brinkley said. ``If John was on a boat, he wanted
to be on the front of the boat with his face in the wind.''

OLD GUARD PROVIDES MEDIA COMMENTARY ON JFK JR.'S LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy Jr. may have carved out a niche as a new breed
of Kennedy who eschewed the family calling and published the first
``post-partisan'' magazine of politics. But it was up to the older
journalistic and political hands to bring context and gravity to
news of his missing plane Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the sometimes frantic, sometimes thoughtful wall-to-wall
television coverage that pre-empted network programming in Boston
Saturday, veteran Kennedy watchers from Mike Wallace to Doris
Kearns Goodwin fleshed out the latest chapter in the tragic history
of America's star-crossed political dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   And as a kind of grim family linkage, file footage of John F.
Kennedy Jr.'s famous salute to his father's passing casket in 1963
filled the airwaves, as did references to Kennedy as ``John John,''
a nickname that emanated from the ``Camelot'' days of his father's
prematurely terminated presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In his role as special correspondent to WCVB-TV (Ch. 5),
longtime Boston political observer Clark Booth called the Kennedys
a ``family like no other in American history'' and said news of the
downed plane was ``the stuff of fiction not fact.'' On WBZ-TV (Ch.
4) veteran political correspondent John Henning -- citing
everything from the assasination of President Kennedy to the skiing
accident that claimed Michael Kennedy -- said that every time the
family tries to recover from such a tragedy, ``somebody throws
another thunderbolt at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on CBS from Martha's Vineyard, a clearly distraught
Wallace lent a sense of history to the events by recalling warm
conversations he'd once had with Richard Nixon about President
Kennedy, who defeated Nixon in the very bitter 1960 election. In an
interview with MSNBC's Brian Williams that aired on WHDH-TV (Ch. 7)
inn Boston, historian Doris Kearns Goodwin recounted a poignant
conversation with matriarch Rose Kennedy. Even given the extent of
her family's turmoil, Goodwin noted, Kennedy was sure that her
children and grandchildren ``would still choose to be who they were
because of the adventure, the excitement and the hugeness of the
lives they led.''
</P>
<P>
   The gravity of Saturday's news was apparent early in the morning
when CBS anchor Dan Rather -- who gained fame as the young reporter
who frantically reported word of President Kennedy's November 1963
death in Dallas -- somberly noted that ``tragedy just seems to
follow this family.''
</P>
<P>
   By early afternoon, two of NBC's heaviest hitters, anchor Tom
Brokaw and Washington bureau chief Tim Russert, were trying to fit
John F. Kennedy Jr's life into the family history. Noting that the
young Kennedy had already been approached to run for governor,
senator and mayor of New York, Russert said that ``those closest to
him believed that ultimately, he would find his way back to public
service.''
</P>
<P>
   But reminiscing about the Kennedy legacy -- and thus justifying
the extensive coverage -- proved the easy part of television's task
Saturday. The more difficult challenge was sorting out and making
sense of the fragmentary and unverified information filtering in in
the hours before the fate of Kennedy's plane became clear.
</P>
<P>
   There were numerous stories -- including the presence of a
flight instructor on board -- that were reported and later
corrected during the day. There was considerable confusion over the
possibility of a locator beacon being activated. Shortly after noon
in Boston, when Channel 7 was reporting an active five-state
search, Channel 5 was saying that the search for the plane was
confined largely to the Martha's Vineyard area. At around 12:30,
Channel 7 aired a CNN report that plane debris had been spotted
near the Vineyard only to note a few minutes later that the debris
had actually been sighted near Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The media's ravenous appetite for instant information in a
crisis situation was painfully obvious to viewers who watched
beleaguered Kennedy spokesman Brian O'Connor field questions from
anxious reporters not long after noon. ``I'm sorry, I don't have
much to add,'' he said, in response to the barrage of queries.
``There's just so little information right now.'' At the Pentagon
briefing that begain shortly thereafter, a spokesman told eager
journalists that ``I must remind you that first reports are (often)
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the afternoon dragged on and reports surfaced of luggage
and debris being connected to the downed plane, a sense of
resignation began emerging on the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time goes by, the situation grows more grim,'' declared
Channel 5's Heather Kahn from the studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has turned into a watch now, almost a death watch at the
compound,'' intoned Henning from the Kennedy compound.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most ironic note of the day was struck by Russert,
who explained how John F. Kennedy Jr. hated the idea of the Kennedy
family ``curse'' and particularly disdained the ``notion of wall to
wall media coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now suddenly (he's) the focus of all this media attention,''
on a ``Kennedy curse'' Russert added, explaining that Saturday's
news virtually coincided with the 30th anniversary of
Chappaquidick, when Mary Jo Kopechne died in a car Senator Edward
Kennedy was driving.

FRIENDS, PUBLIC OFFER SUPPORT TO KENNEDY FAMILY

<P>
   BOSTON -- Jack MacMillan, a tourist from Minneapolis, looked
with awe and sadness over the relics at the John F. Kennedy Library
Museum before stepping out into the piercing sun and experiencing
firsthand another shocking moment in the family's history.
</P>
<P>
   TV crews filled the parking lot of the museum on the water's
edge reporting the disappearance of JFK's son _ the one pictured
inside the museum as a toddler in short pants saluting his father's
casket 36 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow. We haven't . . . we just got off the plane and came
here,'' said MacMillan, who heard the news outside. ``It is weird.
It's awful. . .(we were) just looking at the pictures in there of
John F. Kennedy and John in the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Fisher of New Jersey said it was ``ironic'' that he
decided to visit the museum the day Kennedy's plane was reported
missing. ``We just walked out. We just heard,'' Fisher said. ``We
don't usually watch much news on vacation, but we were on vacation
when (Princess) Diana died, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Anderson of Houston said her daughter Ashley was a
history buff who was intrigued by the Kennedy assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had just taken her to Chappaquiddick,'' she said. She had
never heard of it and it's one of those things I grew up with. The
next morning, we were here.''
</P>
<P>
   As for JFK Jr.'s wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, who also was on
the plane with her sister Lauren, Anderson said: ``Here, everybody
thought she was the luckiest girl in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day phone calls from around the country began
flooding the Kennedy compound in Hyannisport when the television
began broadcasting the story shortly after dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Most Bay State politicians declined to give their thoughts until
something definitive was known about what happened to those on
board the plane.
</P>
<P>
   But Massachusetts Senator John F. Kerry said: ``Like everyone,
I'm stunned. I'm praying and hoping for a good outcome for the
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul G. Kirk Jr., a close friend of the Kennedys, paid a visit
to the Hyannisport compound Saturday morning to offer his support
and help for the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another Kennedy much too young and it's another young
person with hope and promise whose life is dashed,'' Kirk said
softly. ``His dad used to say life can be unfair. But this is one
of those times when you almost think it asks too much.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about his father, that generation, three sons,
and a daughter who died too young...You move along to this
generation, and it's Michael and David and Robert Kennedy. And now
this,'' Kirk said. ``And you have to think about the Bissettes, and
obviously Caroline, John's sister.''
</P>
<P>
   Faith is what the family is leaning on, Kirk added.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the musuem, many were deeply saddened for Caroline
Kennedy Schlossberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Caroline is without her father and mother, and now her
brother,'' said one woman who declined to give her name. ``It's
almost like a curse, they lost so many people,'' said one woman who
declined to give her name.

crater at the moon's south pole, destroying itself for the sake of
science. Alan Binder, the man who conceived Lunar Prospector and
the program's lead scientist, hopes the impact will kick up traces
of water from frozen pockets, proving the existence of ice that
Lunar Prospector's data has strongly indicated. Binder and others
believe the moon's poles contain up to six billion tons of ice,
plenty to support a moon base that Binder thinks should be our next

module Eagle emerged from behind the moon. Radio communication was
spotty, and an overloaded computer signaled alarms. As they neared
the surface, Armstrong steered the lunar module away from a crater,
hunting for a safe spot among a jumble of boulders. Seconds of fuel

Atlanta Olympic officials Monday will unlock the doors on a vast
and historic record of the city's Olympic experience and invite the
public in to take a look. In making available for the first time
some 5,700 boxes of documents and artifacts, Olympic officials are
releasing their longheld grip on privacy and opening the 1996
Centennial Games to microscopic scrutiny. Inside the public and
researchers likely will find the blow-by-blow, behind-the-scenes
story of the staging and organization of Atlanta's biggest event
this century, from the excruciating negotiations over the Olympic
stadium to the controversial decision to reroute the Olympic torch
around Cobb County. (Turner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 50.

PETTITTE, YANKEES AVOID SWEEP BY BRAVES, 11-4 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andy Pettitte's future with the Yankees is on the
line every time he takes the field now, and he needs to pitch well
to stay. Facing the Atlanta Braves Saturday, Pettitte pitched well
enough to beat Atlanta, 11-4, and prevent the Yankees from getting
swept.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch banged a two-run homer, scored three runs and
made an important defensive play as the Yankees (53-36) and Braves
and 55,785 fans at Yankee Stadium sweated and sweltered.
</P>
<P>
   There is deep sentiment in some quarters of the organization
that the Yankees should keep Pettitte; some fret that it is far too
soon to give up on a 27-year-old left-hander with such a tremendous
history of success. But according to a baseball executive who has
had recent contact with the Yankees, general manager Brian Cashman
is under orders to solicit and field offers for Pettitte over the
next two weeks leading to the July 31 trade deadline, and then
forward them to George Steinbrenner, the principal owner, for
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Steinbrenner would not comment directly about whether
Pettitte was going to be traded, but he acknowledged that the next
two weeks were important to Pettitte's future. ``He's got to show
us the old Pettitte,'' Steinbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts from at least two teams _ the Houston Astros and the
Seattle Mariners _ attended Saturday's game to watch Pettitte, and
the reports they will file on the left-hander will probably be
mixed. For the first three innings, he pitched to both sides of the
plate aggressively and accurately, and the Braves counterattacked
by swinging early in the count, without success. Pettitte allowed a
single hit in the first three innings, needing a total of 16
pitches. Steinbrenner watched from his box, and if he had closed
his eyes, he might have confused the Pettitte of the first three
innings Saturday with the image of Pettitte beating Atlanta in Game
5 of the 1996 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   But Pettitte's final two and two-thirds innings of work Saturday
were completely different. The Braves worked the count a little
more, fouled off pitches and punched hits and sometimes drove the
ball. Only one Atlanta batter saw more than two pitches the first
time through the order, but in the second go-round, only one saw
fewer than three.
</P>
<P>
   It was stifling in the Stadium, and Pettitte had to work hard to
get through the fourth inning. With runners at first and second and
two out, Brian Jordan forced Pettitte to throw nine pitches before
the left-hander struck him out, and Pettitte threw 10 pitches to
the next batter, Andruw Jones, and then walked Jones to load the
bases. Pettitte struck out Javy Lopez to end the inning, pumping a
fist. Scoreless inning or not, however, the Braves exacted a heavy
toll: Pettitte threw 31 pitches in that inning.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams smacked his 14th home run of the season in the
bottom of the fourth, increasing the Yankees' advantage to 3-0.
Then Brian Hunter and Eddie Perez, the No. 7 and No. 8 batters in
the Atlanta lineup, hit back-to-back singles to start the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   After Ozzie Guillen advanced both with a bunt, Pettitte threw a
high fastball to Gerald Williams, and Williams bashed it, high and
down the left-field line; it was only a question of whether the
ball would stay fair. Williams edged down the first-base line,
cajoling his drive with body language, begging it to stay fair, and
sure enough, it slammed off the foul pole for a three-run homer.
Tie game. As the runners circled the bases, a new ball was thrown
to Pettitte, and he snapped his glove at it in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   A nifty play by Chuck Knoblauch saved another run for Pettitte.
Bret Boone singled and broke for second on a pitch to Chipper
Jones, who smashed a line drive to left-center, an extra-base hit.
But Knoblauch faked Boone into sliding into second base, and Boone
was unable to recover quickly enough to score, stopping at third.
Pettitte retired the next two batters.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees finished Atlanta's Odalis Perez with a five-run
outburst in the bottom of the fifth. Knoblauch walked, Jeter
singled and O'Neill singled home Knoblauch. Chili Davis doubled,
Bernie Williams was walked intentionally, and both Scott Brosius
and Ricky Ledee had run-scoring singles. Yankees 8, Braves 3.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte threw 65 pitches in the fourth and fifth, however, and
he faded for good in the sixth, giving up a double and single;
after he struck out Ozzie Guillen for the second out on his 96th
pitch, he was relieved by Jason Grimsley. Pettitte's final line:
three runs on nine hits and two walks in five and two-thirds
innings, for his first sixth victory _ more for Steinbrenner to
consider.

KEY OPPOSITION LEADER JOINS RALLY AGAINST MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KRAGUJEVAC, Yugoslavia _ A leading opposition politician, Vuk
Draskovic, appeared Saturday for the first time at a rally calling
for the resignation of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic,
and the formation of a transitional government leading to new
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic urged a festive crowd of some 20,000 people not to
seek revenge or pursue a violent path that could lead to ``civil
war.'' While he spoke of the need for Serbs ``to discuss and accept
the shame for what was done in Kosovo,'' he also criticized NATO
for allowing the Albanians after its air campaign to force Serbs
from the province and asked, ``Why does someone not threaten the
Albanians with bombing?''
</P>
<P>
   By pulling a crowd twice as large as his rivals did on Thursday
here, some 80 miles south of Belgrade, Draskovic attempted to
assert leadership over the democratic opposition to Milosevic and
his government.
</P>
<P>
   But the crowd, although enthusiastic enough, fell short of party
hopes for 30,000 to 50,000 people, and Draskovic delivered a
passionate but wandering address. He gave his supporters little
more direction than to keep demonstrating, in the hope that
Milosevic would somehow agree to resign and call early elections.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Draskovic aides said, however, that they had little hope
that rallies alone, without evidence of serious cracks in
Milosevic's police and armed forces, would bring any quick change
in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, who had been a part of Milosevic's government for
most of the war over Kosovo, had resisted the idea of street
demonstrations until 10 days ago. But his rivals among the
opposition, gathered as the Alliance for Change, were collecting
thousands of ordinary Serbs in towns outside Belgrade for their own
rallies calling for Milosevic to resign after the disastrous war
with NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic also was urged by a senior U.S. diplomat, Robert
Gelbard, in a recent meeting outside Serbia, to join his rivals in
a common platform, to enhance the chances for a more unified
opposition to Milosevic, who retains a strong grip over most
national news media.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic is a bitter rival of Zoran Djindjic, the president of
the Democratic Party and a leader of the Alliance. While the two
men led the large anti-Milosevic street demonstrations of the
winter of 1996-97, which forced Milosevic to recognize opposition
victories in local elections, the two men quickly parted amid
mutual charges of egotism and hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   That rivalry worsened when Draskovic entered the Milosevic
government in January and Djindjic then fled to Montenegro during
the bombing, saying his life was at risk from the police. Even on
Saturday, Draskovic criticized party leaders ``who left the country
to hide or refused a call-up notice'' to fight during the war, as
Djindjic also did, saying that the draft was a form of harassment
from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Some senior Draskovic aides admitted that this rally in
Kragujevac, which is controlled by Draskovic's party and where he
began his failed bid for the Serbian presidency in 1997, was as
much aimed at asserting priority over Djindjic as at hastening
Milosevic's departure.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Draskovic has called for another rally next Saturday in Nis, to
try to increase the pressure on Milosevic. But he has criticized
Djindjic's call for large marches on Belgrade from Serbian cities
as both risky and likely to fail, and his aides are quietly pushing
the Democratic Party to replace Djindjic as president, possibly
with Zoran Zivkovic, the popular mayor of Nis.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday here, other Alliance leaders called on Draskovic to
join them, with his Serbian Renewal Party leading the Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   But Draskovic said Saturday that his party ``will resist
pressure to join anyone,'' and said that all parties should compete
on their own in any new elections. But pressed by the Americans, he
has allowed other opposition parties to have more access to Studio
B, the Belgrade television station his party runs, and he has
provided a radio frequency for the independent journalists of B92,
a station taken over during the war by Milosevic allies.
</P>
<P>
   The split between the parties of Draskovic and Djindjic, so
visible in Belgrade, did not disrupt the ruling coalition here,
said Vesna Pajevic, who is the deputy director of the city's
executive and a member of Draskovic's party.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Saturday, she criticized Draskovic for paying
too little attention to the regions and their problems and too much
attention to his personal position. She said, ``We need unity and a
concrete program to tell people exactly what you will do for them
if they vote for you _ what you will do for the 60,000 unemployed
here in Kragujevac,'' whose biggest employer, the car factory
Zastava, was destroyed by NATO bombs.
</P>
<P>
   On this question, Draskovic was silent on Saturday, although
state television on Friday night led with a government plan to
employ 20,000 Zastava workers immediately and start making 50,000
cars a year again ``soon.'' However fantastic the report, said Mrs.
Pajevic's husband, Velimir, ``it will give people hope and buy
Milosevic more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Pajevic said she urged Draskovic on Saturday in a meeting
to worry less about winning over supporters of Milosevic and to
seize the moment when the government appears at its weakest.
</P>
<P>
   But she admitted that the system the president created had
deprived Serbs of self-confidence and made them unwilling to risk
``what little they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Pajevic, a pediatric surgeon, said sadly: ``There can be
hundreds of meetings like this, but there is not a critical mass.
People come and get it off their chests, and then they go home more
quietly.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughed sourly. ``Serbia has 178 parties and every party
leader is an egomaniac,'' he said. ``We have been very unlucky in
both our government and our opposition.''

THE FINISHING TOUCH IS ELUSIVE FOR PARNEVIK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ Jesper Parnevik has a love-hate
relationship with the British Open. He loves the tournament. He
loves that he has often been in contention. But he hates the fact
that he has never been the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Three times since 1994, Parnevik has entered the final round of
the British Open with a chance to win, but something always went
wrong for him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 at Turnberry in Scotland, Parnevik reached the final
hole tied with Nick Price. But Parnevik neglected to read the
scoreboard and thought he needed a birdie to tie. After a good
drive, Parnevik tried a risky approach shot at the pin, rather than
playing a safer shot toward the middle of the green. His shot
missed the green, Parnevik bogeyed the final hole, and he lost to
Price by one stroke.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 at Royal Troon, Parnevik shot a third-round 66 to take a
2-stroke lead over Darren Clarke and a 5-stroke lead over Justin
Leonard heading into the final round. But Parnevik stumbled to a
final-round 73, while Leonard shot a sensational 65 to win by three
strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at Royal Birkdale, Parnevik entered the final round
trailing Brian Watts by just two strokes, but Parnevik's
final-round 72 was not enough to beat Mark O'Meara, who overtook
Parnevik, then outlasted Watts in a four-hole playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik entered Saturday's third round of the British Open in
contention again, alone in third place (3 over par at 145), two
strokes behind Jean Van de Velde of France, the second-round leader
at 1 under par, but shot a 78, putting him 10-over for the
tournament and seemingly out of contention in a tie for 14th.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointments like the ones Parnevik has endured can either
make you bitter or make you stronger. Parnevik has chosen to stay
strong and optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be the winner, I think you have to have luck, get the right
breaks at the right time, and hole a few putts,'' said Parnevik, a
34-year-old Swede. ``At Troon, I have to admit I thought I was
going to win. The night before, coming to the golf course, and then
on the first tee, I was pretty much sure I was going to win. Then
Justin just came out and shot a 65, which was very impressive. But
I still feel very good about my game, so I'm not going to change
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik should not change much, considering his track record at
the British Open. Why does Parnevik believe his game suits the
British Open?
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the type of shots you have to hit here, the low
drilling punch type of golf shots,'' Parnevik said. ``And I love
the turf. I grew up in Sweden playing on wet, muddy ground. The
club gets stuck in the ground when you hit a ball. I don't think
there's a better feeling or sound when you hit a golf ball anywhere
else in the world than links golf courses. I love the high shots
downwind. You don't hit 9-irons 225 yards very often.''
</P>
<P>
   But Parnevik did not enjoy Friday's second-round 71 as much as
he would have liked. Bothered by a fever and allergies, Parnevik
was not 100 percent, and he played Friday's round with tissue
packed in one nostril to keep his nose from running. After the
fifth hole, Parnevik felt so ill he thought about withdrawing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't felt this bad for five, 10 years,'' said Parnevik.
``Hopefully, I can get some medication of some sort. I felt
terrible. I was sneezing constantly. I had to time putts between
sneezes. I thought I was going to shoot 90 or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Parnevik, he remained in the tournament and
remained in contention. And he continued his history of playing
well when he does not feel well. Parnevik won the Phoenix Open in
1998 while playing with a cold, and he was hoping that a good
night's rest coupled with medication would allow him to play
Sunday's round feeling much improved.
</P>
<P>
   Most players learn to handle the pressure at majors better as
they get older and gain more experience. With players like Norman
and Woods in pursuit, Parnevik will be tested again, but he sounded
confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a lot more comfortable in the situation now,'' Parnevik
said. ``Turnberry was the second time I played in the British and
the second time I played in a major. Standing on the first tee
Sunday, my goal was not to win the tournament, it was pretty much
to break 90 or 100, especially playing with Tom Watson on the last
day. Now, I feel more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik still doesn't seem to be comfortable enough to win, but
win or lose, Parnevik will still love the British Open.

AN ALL-TOO-FAMILIAR HEADLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even now, no words prompt so much anguish, so much grief, so
much disbelief as these: John F. Kennedy is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Those words flew around the country Saturday in frantic
electronic pulses, though this time it was not news of the death of
a president but of his son, missing and feared dead after a
small-plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   This time the fragmentary reports did not throw the government
into convulsion. This time the tragedy did not come at a time of
Cold War peril. This time the news will not freeze a nation in a
frightful memory.
</P>
<P>
   But the news that tragedy had apparently struck another Kennedy
_ indeed, a young man bearing the very name of the slain president
_ still had the power to shock a nation that has come to believe it
is all but inured to shock.
</P>
<P>
   Because the fearful phrase _ John F. Kennedy is dead _ has a
special meaning and triggers, for many, a cascade of emotion and
memory: The flag-draped casket. The widow's unfailing courage. The
funeral Mass in St. Matthew's Cathedral. The foghorn voice of the
late Cardinal Richard Cushing. The skirling of the bagpipers from
the Irish Black Watch. The gathering of world leaders from France's
DeGaulle to Canada's Pearson.
</P>
<P>
   And the salute, unbearably brave, of the president's son on the
day he also turned 3 years old.
</P>
<P>
   This is a different time, of course, the assassination of
President Kennedy having heralded an era of violence and senseless
death that dulled the senses. But in corners of America _ in New
England, in pockets of Washington and, it is not to be denied, in
the supermarket checkout lines where the tabloids blare their
headlines _ the Kennedy family still holds a special place.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend after the assassination, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy
told Boston journalist Theodore H. White that the president used to
like to fall asleep to the strains of ``Camelot.'' Of the immediate
family that, for one brief shining moment, symbolized idealism and
inspiration, only one person remains: Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg.
</P>
<P>
   The son, like the father, was given the name of a storied Boston
mayor, John ``Honey Fitz'' Fitzgerald. The son, like the father,
gained fame, in part, because of his unimaginable good looks. The
son, like the father, has lived dangerously, defied conventions,
stoked romantic visions.
</P>
<P>
   Known first as John-John, then as John Kennedy Jr. and finally
simply as John Kennedy, he was the president's son _ but he was
reared by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   She battled to keep him out of the public eye. She fought to
nurture in him grace and etiquette. She taught him how to have a
private life and that it was possible to satisfy only the most
formal obligations of public duty.
</P>
<P>
   So when Mrs. Onassis died in 1994, the son knew _ he was trained
to know _ how to bear grief, how to show dignity, how to express
loss and love. It was apparent that steamy afternoon on the
Virginia hillside as he stood with his sister and uncle, Senator
Edward M. Kennedy, the president's brother, and bid farewell to his
mother in a relentlessly public moment that should, if there were
justice in death, have been intensely private.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth P. O'Donnell, one of the president's closest aides,
wrote a memoir remembered chiefly for its evocative title, taken
from an old ballad: ``Johnny, we hardly knew ye.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell's title was ironic. We knew much about the president _
his distaste for the ballet his wife loved, for example; his
ability to rally bosses like John Bailey and Richard Daley, his
skill at disarming his foes, like the time he told Richard Nixon,
proud of his triumph in the 1959 ``Kitchen Debate'' with Nikita S.
Khruschev, that he knew a lot of men who won debates in the
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   And now we know even more about President Kennedy, or think we
do, much of it sordid.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains true that, of the son, we've hardly known him.
</P>
<P>
   We know, of course, that he was a storied bachelor, that he
teased the women and seduced the camera, that he plotted a romantic
getaway wedding with a breathlessly beautiful woman on a remote
island, that he started a magazine called ``George.''
</P>
<P>
   But we know little else.
</P>
<P>
   All the rest was guesswork. The magazine is light, like the
times, bearing a slightly ironic name, carrying stories that said
very little, oftentimes written by celebrities about celebrities.
The editor has been famously a gadfly, lunching about town, holding
shimmery parties, meeting with Larry Flynt, the renegade
pornography publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Now he may have joined the litany of aunts and uncles and
cousins and parents, all dead before their time.
</P>
<P>
   The witness to all of this is, of course, is Senator Kennedy,
who once again must grieve, who once again must hold the family
together, who once again must stand, solemnly and bravely, at
grave's edge, who once again must, in the words of John F. Kennedy
Jr.'s father, bear the burden.
</P>
<P>
   On days like this, when the sadness and the memories mix, that
burden may simply be beyond measure _ more than he, his family or a
nation can comprehend.

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ At least 10,000 people were slaughtered
by Serbian forces during their three-month campaign to drive the
Albanians from Kosovo, according to war crimes investigators, NATO
peacekeeping troops and humanitarian agencies struggling to keep up
with fresh reports each day of newly discovered bodies and graves.
</P>
<P>
   That death toll would be more than twice the number of about
4,600 dead estimated by the State Department in late May, shortly
before the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague indicted
the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, and four of his top
aides on charges of crimes against humanity. They were accused of
ordering the Serbs' push to purge Kosovo of its Albanians, who made
up 90 percent of the province's prewar population of 2.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting newly reported mass graves every day in all of
Kosovo,'' said J. Clint Williamson, a legal officer and leading
investigator for the tribunal. ``The list keeps growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon, for example, tribunal investigators and
British troops rushed off to a grassy roadside near the village of
Lukare, a few miles northeast of here, where three grave sites were
reported by local Albanians to contain possibly 100 or more bodies.
The Albanians said the valley had been along the route of a transit
march when Serb forces drove them from the north. The villagers
said their men were taken away from a column of about 500 refugees.
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, four bodies, all extensively decomposed, had
been exhumed and Lt. Col. Robin Hodges, a British spokesman, said
the work was likely to continue all day.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, villagers returning to Goden, a settlement near the
western town of Djakovica, discovered 20 bodies, along with
Yugoslav army log books describing how soldiers had emptied the
village and killed people.
</P>
<P>
   War crimes investigators here say they have been overwhelmed by
the constant flooding in of reports of new grave sites. They add
that the true toll may never be known, because many villagers
simply bury their relatives without telling Western officials.
Other deaths went unrecorded in the chaotic press of events when
peacekeepers and U.N. relief workers first arrived here a month
ago. Still other bodies may never be found, having been burned or
carried off by Serbs in an effort to destroy evidence, or are still
undiscovered, and maybe forever lost, in Kosovo's forests and
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time a villager comes back in, there are new body
findings,'' said an international official familiar with the
progress of the investigation. ``You're dealing with a crime base
that just keeps growing. It's just overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   The constant reports of new grave sites and a lack of
coordination between various international agencies have meant that
it is only in the last few days that investigators, peacekeeping
troops and others have been able to compile reports giving a
comprehensive view on the ground of the scale of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the new system of attempting to pull together the
information from all sources into an aggregate number for the The
Hague tribunal had produced a total of 201 grave sites with a
reported 4,900 bodies, according to Lt. Col. Robin Clifford,
spokesman for Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Jackson, commander of the Kosovo
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday afternoon, Williamson, the Tribunal official, said
the numbers had grown to 280 grave sites with more than 6,100
reported bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford, among others, warned that even those numbers
underreported the actual number of deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to keep track of this,'' the military
spokesman said. ``At first, no one was even keeping any of these
figures. A number of these bodies are being dug up by villagers and
reburied. You could have groups of three, four or five bodies that
do not get reported. We have a group of 30 unclaimed bodies and
that is not an unusual occurrence.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on these kind of numbers, war crimes investigators and
other international officials say there is no doubt the number of
ethnic Albanians estimated to have been killed during the Serbian
purge will reach 10,000, and probably somewhat higher.
</P>
<P>
   That estimate far exceeds, perhaps doubles, the total that could
be estimated from refugee accounts available to reporters and
others while the war was going on.
</P>
<P>
   While it is impossible to say with real certainty exactly how
many died, the estimate of 10,000 is lower than totals suggested
privately by some American and NATO officials before the war ended.
</P>
<P>
   But relatively few of the killings are likely to become part of
war crimes indictments issued by The Hague tribunal. Its
investigators are concentrating on establishing physical evidence
that supports the testimony of witnesses in a more limited series
of killings in which they hope to prove command responsibility on
the part of Milosevic and other high-ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, many of the killings might go without full investigation
or documentation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the teams of forensic experts and criminal
investigators sent to work for the tribunal by the United States,
France, Britain, Canada and other countries concentrated on six
specific sites of killings mentioned in the indictment brought
against Milosevic and his associates on May 27, seeking physical
evidence to corroborate the testimony given by refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment named the town of Djakovica and the smaller towns
or villages of Velika Krusa, Mala Krusa, Bela Crkva, Izbica and
Crkovez, and listed by name about 340 Albanians said to have been
killed in those places.
</P>
<P>
   Besieged by reports of more bodies, those investigators have
moved on to new sites, which tribunal officials say privately may
lead to new indictments of middle- or lower-ranking Serbian
officials. These officials might then testify against their
superiors about how orders were passed.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI team, for example, was assigned two sites in Djakovica,
but investigated five more there and two in the nearby region of
Pec. French investigators were frustrated at Izbica, when a widely
publicized mass grave in which they expected to find about 150
bodies turned out to be empty _ dug up with a backhoe and the
bodies spirited off, investigators said, between the indictment and
the arrival of NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   Only days later, though, they pulled the decomposed bodies of
eight women from wells in the destroyed village of Cirez, acting on
reports from local residents. ``It was not a pretty sight,'' said
Yves Roy, a member of the French forensic team.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, throwing bodies in wells, which poisons the water
supply, appears to have been a common Serbian tactic during the
wave of killings, along with burning down houses with bodies
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Of 44 villages in the district around Decani, for example, 39
had dead bodies in their wells, one of this week's daily internal
situation reports from the field to the United Nations High
Commission for Refugees said.
</P>
<P>
   While the tribunal's investigators are trying to set priorities
about which reports to investigate, they say they are becoming
overtaken by the sheer number of new accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start the day with a list of 10 things to do, it all
gets blown away,'' an investigator said. ``You get reports that
villagers are going to dig up graves and rebury people on their own
and you have to rush out so they don't destroy evidence. It's just
so widespread. Every little village has been hit. You want to do
the decent thing and respond immediately and at least record what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Every international agency working here has been deluged with
similar reports, often simply to make some kind of record of who
has been killed.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the tribunal's investigators, mostly hardened
detectives, the requests to identify victims have been touching.
Many people simply approach investigators, aid workers or
journalists in an attempt somehow to make the victims part of the
historical, or personal, record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very emotional,'' said Chief Superintendent John T.
Bunn of Scotland Yard, who said he identified at least 60 victims
in the village of Bela Crkva. ``The villagers were coming out
themselves to help us exhume the graves. There was a man who
uncovered his father and he wanted to be photographed with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the detectives appear stunned at the extent of the
killing. Chris Whitcomb, an FBI agent working at the Djakovica site
noted, as did other investigators, that they were working with the
resources that would typically be assigned to tracking a serial
killer in a big city, who might have claimed a dozen victims, while
here, in Kosovo, there are thousands of dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The destruction is just incredible,'' Whitcomb said. ``This
took a huge amount of effort. Home after home, street after street,
town after town. The sheer volume is astonishing. A staggering
number of people have been killed.''

 &HT;    New Orleans uneasy about `Big One'
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW OREANS _ They call it the ``Big One,'' the dreaded hurricane
that could hit New Orleans in just the right place and with just
the right force to turn this city into a giant lake.
</P>
<P>
   The Big One hasn't hit in modern times, but last September it
came so close you could almost smell it. That close call, combined
with predictions of a busy 1999 hurricane season, has given many
residents the jitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more scared now, because of Hurricane Georges,'' said
Martha Arroyave, a beautician who lives on the West Bank of New
Orleans. Georges headed straight for New Orleans on Sept. 26.
Arroyave and her husband evacuated, along with record numbers of
New Orleanians.
</P>
<P>
   Georges turned east and hit Mississippi, but not before it
scared the daylights out of some residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were crazy to stay,'' said Michelle Kirtley, an assistant
professor at Loyola University. She holed up with her fiance and
their two dogs at his Uptown home, a typical one-story ``double
shotgun'' house that has withstood storms for more than 100 years.
Uptown, near Audubon Park, is considered high ground here, as is
the French Quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we thought we would move to the attic if the city
flooded,'' Kirtley said. ``But I saw a town meeting on television
about hurricanes, and it said the water would be up to the roof on
that style house. New Orleans will be a toilet bowl, and that's
what it will smell like too. If it comes close this year, I'm outta
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The toilet bowl image is apt, said Frank Hijuelos, director of
the New Orleans Office of Emergency Preparedness. New Orleans _
which is as much as 3 feet below sea level in many areas, lower
than any other major U.S. city _ is like a bowl, whose rim is
defined by the Mississippi River levees and Lake Pontchartrain to
the north. If a hurricane pushes water over the 17-foot levees,
which could happen only under very specific circumstances, the city
would be submerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water would have nowhere to go,'' Hijuelos said. ``It
would take weeks before we could pump it out. And if you were
planning to live in your attic, there will probably be lots of
snakes and critters living up there with you.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Hijuelos and other city officials have been repeating
a single message as often as they can: When we ask you to leave,
please go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sound like Chicken Little, and I don't want to
scare people, but then again, I do,'' Hijuelos said.
</P>
<P>
   The city will have no shelters if there is a threat of what
Hijuelos calls ``total inundation.'' By having no shelters, city
officials hope to encourage more people to leave. There will be
shelters outside the areas of highest risk. And there will be a
``refuge of last resort'' for residents who simply can't leave _
probably the Superdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got more people evacuated last year than ever in our
history,'' Hijuelos said. ``My one message is that we live in a
bowl and the only way you are safe is out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Although New Orleans is 100 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, its
position below sea level makes it one of the most vulnerable spots
in the country when it comes to hurricanes. And Georges left
residents feeling that vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   At crawfish boils and cocktail parties this summer, residents
compare neighborhoods, boasting if they are on high ground and
fretting if they are in a low-lying area. They talk of favorite
``hurricane foods'' _ Pop Tarts top most lists _ and they debate
the benefits of staying put or evacuating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is talking about it, and I think that's good,''
Hijuelos said.
</P>
<P>
   All these predictions and worries seem premature to Nash
Roberts, the 81-year-old weatherman who has gained a reputation for
never missing in his forecasts of where hurricanes will hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see no unusual situation here,'' he said. ``You could have
an active season and it's conceivable the storms never strike any
mainland, or you could have an inactive season and have one hit
you. I don't see any particular reason for any stretch of the
coastline to be more worried than any other one.''
</P>
<P>
   And New Orleans is well-protected for most hurricane situations,
Hijuelos said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a Category 4 or 5, or a slow-moving Category 3, coming
over the city with the eye touching the western side _ that's the
threat we fear the most,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricanes come in five categories with five being the
strongest.
</P>
<P>
   Since that specific scenario hasn't happened yet, some residents
aren't holding their breath. David Perkins, a lifelong resident who
works at Home Depot, said he didn't evacuate last year, and he
won't this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll stay, unless Mom wants to go,'' he said. ``But she
stayed last year.''
</P>
<P>
   And for all the talk, residents haven't rushed in for hurricane
supplies, such as plywood for windows and doors, Perkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wait until they see a hurricane in the Gulf of
Mexico,'' he said. ``That's when we see a lot of action.

FOR KENNEDY, A CHALLENGING FLIGHT IN A NEWER AIRCRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANTHONY FLINT AND MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Visibility wasn't optimal. He wasn't licensed to fly using
instruments only, and some fellow pilots suggest he should have
brought a flight instructor. He had just upgraded to a more
powerful and complicated plane.
</P>
<P>
   But as he headed for the small airport on Martha's Vineyard
Friday night, John F. Kennedy Jr. knew where he was going.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good pilot and as familiar with this airport as
someone of his experience could be,'' said Arthur Marx, chief pilot
for Flywright Aviation at Martha's Vineyard Airport, where Kennedy
and his first plane, a Cessna Skyline 182, were seen frequently
over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy purchased his new plane _ a 1996 model Piper Saratoga II
TC, a 300-horsepower, single-engine six-seater _ in April for an
estimated $300,000. It was originally used by a private North
Carolina company, then by Munir Hussain of Hasbrouck, N.J., who
sold it to Kennedy through a broker. Government and company records
indicate no history of mechanical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy learned to fly at Flight Safety International in
Lakeland, Fla., and obtained his basic pilot's license two years
ago. Since then, fellow pilots estimate he probably logged at least
200 hours of flying time _ not a rookie, but not deeply experienced
_ in smaller, less powerful planes such as the Cessna. Then he
``traded up'' to the Saratoga, doubtless looking for more carrying
capacity and power, fellow pilots say.
</P>
<P>
   The Saratoga has state-of-the-art equipment, including an
automatic pilot. It also has a second fuel tank that the pilot must
remember to select to avert disaster. ``You're very busy in the
cockpit,'' said Myron Goulian, head of Executive Flyers Aviation in
Bedford, Mass., a 35-year-old family-owned flight school. ``That
might have been a little bit too much plane for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Goulian also questioned why Kennedy took off Friday evening from
the airport in New Jersey in the first place. Pilots were reporting
poor visibility due to haze, he said. Kennedy was not licensed to
fly using instruments only, did not have a flight instructor
accompanying him and may have had an injured foot as well _
although one N.J.-based pilot, Larry Lorenzo, said Kennedy could
have operated the rudder pedals on the plane fairly easily. ``If he
could walk, he could fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy also didn't file a flight plan with authorities, though
he was not required to, and did not ask for a private service that
tracks private flights, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shouldn't have been in the air, in my opinion. He should
have been at home or in a bus or a train,'' Goulian said. ``That
was a bad judgment call, to leave, especially that late at night.
From what I hear it was a horrible night.''
</P>
<P>
   The less-than-perfect visibility conditions _ known in flying
parlance as ``marginal VFR (visual flight rules),'' made Kennedy's
trip more challenging than normal, agreed Warren Morningstar,
director of media relations for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots
Association, a general aviation lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots under those conditions would have ``a more difficult time
discerning the horizon. The ability to see the horizon, or having a
view of the ground, is needed for spatial oreintation to keep the
plane upright,'' Morningstar said.
</P>
<P>
   Concerning the more powerful aircraft, Goulian said, ``you just
adjust to the performance capability of the airplane, and you need
the experience level to keep up with it. It's great as long as
you're ahead of the airplane. Some pilots jump from a 90 m.p.h
training airplane to a 220 m.p.h. plane that's very slippery and
high-performance, and they get through that phase. Others don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar said the Saratoga ``is not the sort of plane you
would want to learn to fly in, but it should not be a handful for a
low-time pilot who had proper training in the aircraft. They are
very solid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really easy to fly. My 6-year-old son can and has kept
it flying straight,'' said Michael Danziger, a Lincoln, Mass. pilot
who owns a Saratoga and flies frequently to the Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   The plane has sophisticated avionics including GPS, or global
positioning system, which would enable Kennedy to be sitting on the
ground in Caldwell, N.J., plug in Martha's Vineyard and get the
distance and compass heading he should target. Among other things,
GPS can tell a pilot where the nearest airport is in case of
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The plane also has an autopilot, that with the press of two
buttons, will keep the craft at a designated altitude and heading,
and by moving a dial on a compass, the pilot can turn the plane
even though the auto pilot is still engaged.

<P>
   BOSTON -- Carolyn Bessette Kennedy was the only one truly
excited about getting into an airplane with him, a smiling John F.
Kennedy Jr. told a reporter. They both loved being able to fly off
together whenever they felt like it.
</P>
<P>
   Now the couple, and Bessette's sister Lauren, are missing, after
their Piper Saratoga failed to arrive as expected on Martha's
Vineyard Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Since the media became obsessed with Carolyn Bessette Kennedy
six years ago, tagging her as the princess of a new Camelot, she
constantly has been compared with Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   But the marriage of Bessette, 33, and the son of the late
president is far more modern than that. Reporters kept a respectful
distance from Camelot, for one thing. There was no chance of that
here.
</P>
<P>
   And by all accounts, this is a far more equal marriage: Bessette
Kennedy has a great deal more spunk, and a much stronger will, than
Kennedy Onassis during her marriage to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons between Bessette Kennedy and Kennedy Onassis were
inescapable from the start: from the moment she was first
photographed, Bessette _ a publicist for designer Calvin Klein at
the time _ became a walking style bible. Her studied casual look --
clean and minimal -- was dissected by fashion magazines, imitated
by upper West Side residents and midwestern teenagers alike. Her
perfectly straight blond hair and six-foot frame were destined to
captivate the public. Magazine editors coveted her aquiline face
for their covers.
</P>
<P>
   But she denied them.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kennedy Onassis, Bessette avoided reporters, and constantly
tried to dodge the paparazzi, who seemed to find her anyway.
Sometimes, she was less polite than her partner's mother would have
been, abusing photographers who pushed her too hard.
</P>
<P>
   But for their wedding day, the couple conspired to outfox the
paparazzi, and succeeded, at least temporarily, managing to wed in
complete secret on Cumberland Island off the coast of Georgia
before 40 friends. The bias-cut, white crepe dress, of course,
spawned immediate knock-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Bessette Kennedy grew up in affluent Greenwich, Conn., with
Lauren, and Lauren's identical twin Lisa, 18 months older than
Carolyn.
</P>
<P>
   Only Lauren was on the plane with Carolyn.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren's black suitcase labeled with her Morgan Stanley business
card was among the first bits of debris that washed up on the
Martha's Vineyard beach _ a heart-stopping find for swimmers. The
bag contained a bathing suit, a hairdryer and some makeup.
</P>
<P>
   At the island airport Friday evening, a couple and little girl
waited for Lauren Bessette to arrive. They told an airport
employee, Adam Budd, they had met Lauren in Hong Kong, where she
worked as an investment banker. She has since transferred to New
York. The couple waited for a while, left their phone number with
Budd should the plane arrive, and left at about 10 p.m. None of
them reported the plane missing.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren, a 1982 graduate of Greenwich (Conn.) High School, was
reportedly dating Bobby Shriver, JFK Jr.'s counsin.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters' mother, Ann Freeman, who has worked as a teacher
and school administrator in New York public schools, and her
father, William Bessette, divorced when they were children. Their
stepfather, Richard Freeman, is chief of orthopedic surgery at a
White Plains, New York, hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Bessette Kennedy attended Greenwich High School for two years
before transferring to St Mary's High School, now closed. She
graduated from there in 1983. Even in high school, she was defined
by her looks: classmates dubbed her ``The Ultimate Beautiful
Person.''
</P>
<P>
   At Boston University, Bessette Kennedy majored in elementary
education. She was not a joiner, participating in few university
activities. In her yearbook, her name appears on a page for
``camera-shy'' graduates who didn't want their pictures taken. She
did, however, pose for a photographer, who was preparing a ``Women
of BU'' calendar.
</P>
<P>
   When she graduated in 1988, Bessette Kennedy worked not in
education, but for nightclub owner Patrick Lyons, organizing
parties for local companies at his Lansdowne Street nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that, she began work at a Calvin Klein store in
Chestnut Hill where, it is said, Klein himself spotted her and
brought her to his flagship store in New York, to attend to his
celebrity clients. There, she was a fixture in the city's edgiest
nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   She may have met Kennedy at the store, or in Central Park, or
through friends, but neither partner has stepped forward to set the
public straight on that count.
</P>
<P>
   When her relationship with Kennedy became public, she had moved
into the store's public relations department: suddenly, all of the
calls were about her and not the designer.
</P>
<P>
   She hunkered down, leaving Calvin Klein, avoiding her usual
outings, and especially the press, who nonetheless occasionally
caught her in unflattering light. They captured her on videotape
during a shouting match with Kennedy in Central Park, told of her
explosive temper, and exposed the fact that she had been illegally
sub-letting her rent-controlled apartment.
</P>
<P>
   She recently told a reporter she had stopped reading about
herself. ``I don't want to know,'' she told the New York Daily
News. The gossip ``has nothing to do with me or how I live my life.
I have problems and issues just like anybody. But I'm a happy
person, and maybe a better person, for not knowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Since their marriage, the couple have maintained a relatively
low profile, attending functions for George magazine, of which John
F. Kennedy Jr. is publisher and editor-in-chief, and the occasional
charity or social event.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the flashbulbs and microphones, Bessette Kennedy has
managed to remain mysterious, as her husband's late mother did
after the Kennedy assassination. In that sense, she has fed the
mystique.
</P>
<P>
   While her personal style has become as familiar as that of the
late Princess Diana, to whom she has also been compared, there have
been few clues as to her likes and dislikes, her opinions and
ambitions. Those have remained hers alone.

 &HT;    Montgomerie says he's OK with the pressure
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ Colin Montgomerie has resorted to some
questionable mental gymnastics at the 128th British Open.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, the Scot is questioning the fortitude of leader
Jean Van de Velde, wondering whether he can handle the pressure of
a major championship today. At the same time Montgomerie, after
trying to publicly write himself off at the halfway point to
relieve pressure, bristled at a reporter asking whether he could
handle the Sunday tension.
</P>
<P>
   Neither player, by the way, has won a major championship.
</P>
<P>
   After shooting a 72 Saturday that provided an outside chance of
contending today from 9-over, Montgomerie tried to clarify an
opinion from Friday that he was out of the tournament at 8-over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I wasn't out of it,'' Montgomerie said after a Saturday
72. ``I just wanted to try to deflect the situation (Friday) away
from myself and on to other people. The way things were going today
after 14 holes (until bogeys at 15, 16 and 17), it was working.''
</P>
<P>
   After indicating that the Frenchman has not yet seen the Open
Championship's genuine pressure, Monty was asked if he ``can cope
with the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no pressure from (you), OK,'' Montgomerie said,
glaring. ``I can cope with the pressure. I think I proved myself a
number of times now that I can cope with the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval not a factor
</P>
<P>
   David Duval, with four PGA Tour wins this year and the world's
No. 2 ranking, continued his invisible performance at the Open
Championship, where he has fought with both the local tabloids
about course criticism and the course itself. Duval shot a
third-round 75 to stand at 17 shots off the lead. ``I never said I
didn't like the golf course,'' he said Saturday. ``It's a great
golf course, but like the U.S. Open when it's set up, the smallest
mistake costs you.'' Duval does not think the course set-up
necessarily will identify the best player in the field, but that
can be said for just about any major championship. Didn't Andy
North win two U.S. Opens?
</P>
<P>
   Love drops out of sight
</P>
<P>
   Sea Island's Davis Love III turned the front nine in 40 Saturday
en route to a 77, dropping to 12-over 225 and 12 shots off the
lead. . . . U.S. Open champion Payne Stewart's 74 placed him at
13-over 226, finishing with two bogeys. ``My attitude hasn't
changed to the Open,'' Stewart said. ``I am disappointed in the
course setup, but my view of the British Open hasn't changed. I
love the tournament and I think it's the foremost golf tournament
in the world. . . . .Even being an American and having two U.S.
Opens, I've always held the British Open dear to my heart and it
would really complete my career if I could win one.'' . . .Lee
Janzen five-putted the 15th hole for an eight and shot 79 . .
.Alpharetta resident Scott Dunlap took a triple-bogey eight on the
par-5, 578-yard 6th hole, turning the front nine in 40 for an
eventual 76 and 12-over 225 . . .Nobody bogeyed the 515-yard 14th.
There were 43 birdies, 29 pars and an eagle at the 14th. . . One of
the nastiest photos in recent memory appeared in the Scottish
edition of the London Daily Mail Saturday. Sweden's Jesper Parnevik
was the cover shot, with pieces of tissue paper stuck up his nose
to fight a hayfever drip. The headline: ``Sneezy Does It.'' . .
Parnevik triple-bogeyed the 11th hole Saturday from the middle of
the fairway, shooting 78 to drop 10 strokes off the lead at 223.
``It's not my tournament, this one,'' said Parnevik, a two-time
runnerup at the Open Championship. ``It's gone now for this year.
Oh yeah, again.''

QUESTIONS RAISED IN DISAPPEARANCE OF PIPER SARATOGA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When John F. Kennedy Jr. climbed into the cockpit of a small
plane Friday night, he was, by all accounts, in for a difficult
ride. The plane was small but powerful, the conditions tough for
navigation.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of Kennedy's plane has raised familiar
questions about the rules regarding flights, the safety of flying
small aircraft, and the weather conditions that might have made
Kennedy's flight especially difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the issues that may have come in to play when
Kennedy's six-seater plane took off from New Jersey:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What was the original schedule for Kennedy's flight?
</P>
<P>
   A. Kennedy took off from Essex County Airport in Fairfield, N.J.
at 8:38 p.m. Friday night, flying a Piper Saratoga single-engine
plane. On board were Kennedy's wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and
her sister Lauren. The flight was expected to arrive at Martha's
Vineyard Airport at about 10 p.m., but never did.
</P>
<P>
   The last radar signal from Kennedy's plane was received at 9:38
p.m., as the plane made its approach into Martha's Vineyard. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What were the conditions at the time of the flight?
</P>
<P>
   A. According to the National Weather Service, visibility at
Essex County Airport was 4-5 miles in haze, with clear skies, at
about the time Kennedy took off. Those are considered marginal
conditions for the use of Visual Flight Rules: piloting a plane by
using visual or ground references to guide you.
</P>
<P>
   If visibility is 1,000 to 3,000 miles and the cloud ceiling is
between 500 and 1,000 feet, pilots are required to use Instrument
Flight Rules, using a plane's mechanical systems to guide the
flight. Flying under IFR requires additional certification, which
Kennedy did not have.
</P>
<P>
   Flight instructors say hazy conditions are difficult for VFR
flying, especially at night, and especially over the water, where
pilots have no visual reference points to guide them.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Kennedy was due to arrive at Martha's Vineyard,
visibility had improved, increasing to 10 miles, according to the
National Weather Service. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are runway lights on at the Martha's Vineyard Airport at all
times?
</P>
<P>
   A. The lights would have been on as Kennedy's plane made its
final approach to Martha's Vineyard at about 9:30 p.m. Lights are
turned off when the airport tower closes at 10 p.m., but pilots can
turn them on by radio. The airport operates 24 hours a day. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Should anyone in the airport have been concerned that
Kennedy's flight did not arrive, or that his radar dropped off?
</P>
<P>
   A. Probably not. Kennedy was not required to file a flight plan
for his trip to Martha's Vineyard. If a plane has not filed a
flight plan, and is not in radio contract with controllers, any
deviation would not cause alarm. It is unclear whether Kennedy
communicated with the control tower at Martha's Vineyard. Airport
officials Saturday declined to comment. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What kind of flight certification did John F. Kennedy, Jr.
have?
</P>
<P>
   A. Kennedy received his basic pilot's license two years ago in
Florida, and frequently flew in his Cessna Skyline 182. In April,
he purchased the Piper Saratoga plane, which has far more engine
power and requires additional training to fly. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are the requirements for flight certification?
</P>
<P>
   A. To receive an initial certification, a student pilot must
complete a written exam, log at least 40 hours of flight time, and
pass a final ``check ride'' with an FAA examiner. Most students log
60 or 70 hours before seeking certification. To fly a plane with
complex gear or a more powerful engine, a student needs further
instruction and the endorsement of a flight instructor. It is not
known now whether Kennedy received additional instruction before or
after buying a more powerful plane. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there anything special about the type of plane Kennedy was
flying, and what is its safety record?
</P>
<P>
   A. The Piper Saratoga II is a 300-horsepower six-seater with a
maximum speed of 192 knots and a cruising range of 188 nautical
miles, or about five hours of flying time if the fuel tanks are
topped off. Manufactured by The New Piper Aircraft Inc. of Vero
Beach, Fla., it is described in company literature as the ``SUV of
single-engine planes.'' More than 7,500 are in use worldwide,
flying 500,000 hours annually.
</P>
<P>
   The plane is equipped with an Emergency Locating Transmitter,
which can be triggered manually by the pilot, or is automatically
activated by impact with the ground or water. The transmitter emits
a radio signal but does not work underwater. There is no flight
data recorder as with large commercial jets.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, the Saratoga has been involved in 118 accidents or
incidents, according to the National Transportation Safety Board,
and 26 crashes in which a fatality occured.

 GOP REBELS THREATEN TO PASS A TOUGHER BILL ON MANAGED CARE  
(mk) 
 By ADAM CLYMER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A group of rebellious House Republicans, in
defiance of their leaders, are trying to pass much tougher
regulation of managed-care plans than the Senate adopted last week
and say they can win if they can force a vote.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders, like the Republican-controlled Senate, are trying
to stand firm against any legislation creating a right to sue
health plans offered by most large, multistate employers. But
dissidents talk openly of working with Democrats and passing a bill
that would allow such suits while perhaps limiting the damages that
could be awarded.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, who call the Senate bill a sham, are pinning their
hopes on negotiations between Reps. Tom Bliley, R-Va., the chairman
of the Commerce Committee, and John Dingell of Michigan, its senior
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the possibility of agreement is pretty good,'' said
Rep. Charles Norwood, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley and Dingell are expected to meet on Monday. But the
mavericks are wary of the Republican leaders' control of the
machinery of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Greg Ganske, R-Iowa, who called the Senate bill, which the
White House has said President Clinton would veto, ``not much more
than a fig leaf,'' said he feared the leaders might try to bypass
the Commerce Committee and send the Senate bill, or some other weak
one, directly to the floor through the Rules Committee, which the
leadership controls absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of fair debate can we get out of Rules?'' Ganske
asked.
</P>
<P>
   But, like Norwood, Ganske made it clear that he would break with
his party on a procedural vote to get their proposals considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beat us if you can,'' Norwood said, ``but don't avoid the
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Three factors make the House a different playing field from the
Senate, where last week's debate seemed less focused on making a
law than on making campaign commercials, the sort that accuse an
incumbent of voting for excessive costs on health care or, on the
other side, favoring drive-by mastectomies.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' thin 223-211 majority is one factor that
distinguishes the House from the Senate. Last year, more for
campaign protection than in the expectation of getting a law
enacted, Republicans passed a modest patients' bill by only a
216-210 tally, and they lost six seats in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership of Ganske, who is a reconstructive surgeon,
Norwood, a dentist, and two other physicians, Reps. Tom Coburn,
R-Okla., and John Cooksey, R-La., is a second factor. Like many
other doctors, and the American Medical Association with whom they
appeared last week to denounce the Senate bill, they regard managed
care's spending controls as an intrusion and a threat to patients'
health. Norwood, Coburn and Cooksey voted with their party a year
ago, but cannot be counted on this time.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the issue seems to have a stronger political influence in
the House, where contested races can be influenced by a much
smaller expenditure of television dollars than it takes to sway a
Senate contest in all but the smallest states.
</P>
<P>
   A warning came through clearly in last week's CBS News Poll,
showing that 14 percent of Americans regarded health care as the
most important problem for government to address, the highest
percentage of any issue. Not only is managed care the health issue
most intensely fought over in Washington. It is matched only by the
need to insure all Americans _ on which no legislation is
contemplated _ as a public concern.
</P>
<P>
   In the poll of 722 adults, taken during the Senate debate, 49
percent said Democrats were more likely to improve the health care
system and 27 percent said Republicans were. The poll showed
growing hostility to health maintenance organizations and other
managed care plans. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus
or minus four percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   There may be little immediate political impact from the
legislative activity. Dr. Kathleen Frankovic, director of surveys
for CBS News, said, ``The public is clearly not paying close
attention to the details of the debate in Washington.'' But that is
no salvation for Republicans, because it means the public's
instinctive sense that Democrats handle health issues better goes
unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation favored by the dissident doctors in the House
would differ from the bill passed by the Senate in many areas
beyond the provision for lawsuits when patients claim they have
suffered from a denial of proper benefits.
</P>
<P>
   It would cover all health insurance plans, not just the large
ones governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or
ERISA. It would guarantee patients a right to appeal insurers'
decisions to third parties not chosen by the insurer. It would
require health maintenance organizations to offer their customers
the right to pay more to use outside doctors. It would prohibit
penalties against doctors who seek additional care for patients.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders hope to pass a package of bills offered by Rep.
John Boehner, R-Ohio. That package, basically what the House passed
last year, provides for a slightly less independent external review
than the doctors' bill, and does not cover plans outside of those
governed by ERISA or authorize the outside-doctor access in the
doctors' measure.
</P>
<P>
   It seeks to expand insurance coverage by provisions to enable
small employers to join pools to buy insurance at the lower rates
available to large purchasers. While it would not authorize suits,
it would subject health plans to prosecution if they disobeyed the
finding of an external review panel. But a central feature,
emphasized last week by Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, the majority
leader, is the absence of a right-to-sue provision.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had my son or daughter in the hospital and I was
concerned about their care, I would not be consoled by a lawyer
that says, `Well, the judge says six months from now we can get you
on the docket,''' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Boehner moved his plan through a subcommittee he
heads on the Committee on Education and the Work Force. A spokesman
for Boehner said he hoped to move it further as soon as possible.
But Norwood, a member of that committee as well as of Commerce,
said the Boehner measures could not win a majority on the work
force committee.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders have said they want to consider patients'
legislation during the week beginning July 26. But if they find
they do not have the votes, they could postpone action.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And whatever the House passes, if anything, would have to clear
a conference with the Senate where Republicans displayed remarkable
unity all week in fighting off amendments to broaden the impact of
their plan. Final congressional action could easily not come before
next year, and it would have to be quite different from the Senate
bill before Clinton would sign it.
</P>
<P>
   It seems clear that the Clinton administration would embrace a
measure close to the one the doctors are seeking, even if some
limits on suits, not in it now, were added. The administration was
ready to embrace a compromise offered on Thursday by Sen. John
Chafee, R-R.I., even though it barred punitive damages, because it
provided broader coverage than the bill the Senate passed.
</P>
<P>
   But the senator needed to prove that he had five Republican
votes, enough to force a tie that Vice President Al Gore could have
broken if all Democrats voted for the plan. Chafee said that in the
end his only Republican ally was Sen. Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee said, ``We thought we had more, but it didn't work out
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   In the House, it is not clear whether there are enough defectors
to overpower the leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of Republicans who egg me on, every day, to
get something done,'' Norwood said.

   Y2K-PREPARE _ As the millennium approaches, businesses are
working hastily to reassure customers that they are ready for the
Y2K bug. But are they? Financial institutions such as banks and
savings and loans are one of the most prepared industries, but
other sectors, such as consumer goods and retail are not. The
government is lagging behind in preparedness too, but at least the
U.S. Treasury decided to circulate more money just in case there's
a bank run.

BUSINESSES ZERO IN ON CALMING Y2K FEARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Businesses have been gearing up for the Y2K
millennium bug problem for years. Many corporations say they're
ready.
</P>
<P>
   But do their customers know?
</P>
<P>
   In the final stages of preparing for Y2K, companies realize that
it's not enough to get their systems in order. Due to heightened
media attention to this problem, they also have to allay a growing
concern among their customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, they were more focused on communicating to
their own employees because it was an issue internally,'' said
Roger Rittner, a senior vice president at Sheppard Associates, a
Y2K communication consultant. ``In the last six months, when the
press latched on to the Y2K as an issue, companies found that they
have to talk to customers as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K problem, of course, is that at the advent of the year
2000, computers programmed in old languages that only use two
digits for years won't be able to differentiate between 1900 and
2000. It could cause widespread havoc since computer functions will
be disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   San Fernando Valley businesses are aware of the issue and those
that think they'll be affected by it have made preparations, said
Bob Scott, vice chairman at the Valley Industry and Commerce
Association in Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks they're ready,'' he said. ``People who think
they might have a problem are dealing with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the real test to see if preparations have been adequate will
come on Jan. 1, Scott added.
</P>
<P>
   The companies most at risk are those using technology dated
between the early 1960s and mid-1980s, Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-June, a Y2K test at the Donald C. Tillman reclamation
plant in Van Nuys led to 4 million gallons of raw sewage spilling
into Woodley Avenue Park.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a government study of U.S. industries
concluded that all segments of the economy are vulnerable to the
Y2K problem. Hospitals, doctors' offices, utilities, airports and
the government are less prepared than companies in banking,
insurance, telecommunications and finance.
</P>
<P>
   Among the best prepared, financial institutions are rushing to
get the message out to their customers not to panic and withdraw
massive amounts of cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see a lot more communication,'' said John
Stafford, a spokesman at the California Bankers Association in San
Francisco. ``There's an increasing awareness that banks need to
communicate directly with the customer. Consumers are not getting
it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, Union Bank of California customers started seeing
friendly red-and-black stickers on the ATM machines saying ``Y2K
OK.'' The San Francisco-based bank also is sending mailers
informing customers of its preparations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's designed to reassure customers,'' said spokeswoman Joanne
Kurran, who declined to say how much money the bank has spent
fixing the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America, which shelled out $500 million for Y2K, has
launched a toll-free number -- (888) 960-1111 -- to answer customer
concerns in six languages: English, Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese,
Vietnamese and Korean.
</P>
<P>
   BofA branches have Y2K brochures on display racks, informational
inserts are included with account statements, and the bank's Web
site also addresses the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Mutual said it completed Y2K testing in 1998. The
thrift is communicating its Y2K compliance to customers through
brochures, monthly statements to customers and its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Other forms of communication include screen savers, wallet cards
and reports to employees, Rittner said. Y2K isn't going to cripple
America, but it will be a problem elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like in the U.S. there will be very little
disruption,'' he said. ``The big worry is outside the U.S. Will
they bring down international systems? The focus of concern has
shifted overseas.''

SMALL-TOWN WRESTLING DRAWS BLOOD AND FANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to DELETE photo note)  (jt)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

   BAYONNE, N.J. _ As the crowd of hundreds chanted ``Make them
bleed! Make them bleed!'' Frank Iadavaia raised the metal garbage
can above his head and heaved it into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   It bounced on the canvas, spilling crutches, wooden canes and
frying pans provided by the fans in the furtherance of mayhem,
across the mat. Then Iadavaia led a dozen wrestlers over the ropes
and started whacking anything, and anyone, that moved.
</P>
<P>
   The battle might have seemed like a sporting event gone horribly
wrong. But as evenings go for Jersey All-Pro Wrestling, one of the
scores of independent wrestling federations that have blossomed
across the country in the last five years, it was run of the mill.
</P>
<P>
   Steeped in blood, these tiny leagues have seized upon a hunger
among their fans for increased realism and violence in professional
wrestling _ for a real-life urgency that their larger counterparts,
the World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling,
cannot supply.
</P>
<P>
   But is it fake? Well, sort of. It has long been one of
professional wrestling's canards that matches are scripted, lacking
even the slightest spontaneous move. While that is mostly true for
the larger leagues, which plan everything for television and do not
pretend that the pain they portray is real, the smaller leagues,
which operate outside the media's eye, are somewhat looser when it
comes to blood.
</P>
<P>
   Though wrestlers at Jersey All-Pro Wrestling and other, similar,
leagues do plan most of their matches in advance, the techniques
they use are more dangerous than those in the big leagues, and are
designed to meet an expectation in the crowd that actual beatings
will occur. Some of the pain and blood is fake. Some is quite real.
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, is the point.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows for sure how many independent leagues like Jersey
All-Pro Wrestling exist throughout the country. The small outfits,
which are often no more than a promoter and his stable of
wrestlers, have no governing body, and promoters and newsletter
writers who follow the sport say there are so many new federations
popping up each month that it would be impossible to count them
all.
</P>
<P>
   Jersey All-Pro, which began in this blue-collar enclave, is a
typical example of an independent league, and Iadavaia, a Bayonne
native who wrestles under the name Lightning Lou Diamond, embodies
the passions that characterize it.
</P>
<P>
   A thick-waisted, ebullient man of 26, he founded Jersey All-Pro
in 1995 while working as an administrative clerk by day and manager
of an auto body shop at night. Though he said his first shows were
depressing failures _ no more than a dozen fans showed up _ he
found what he needed to draw in the fans when he discovered
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doing all kinds of things back then to bring in the
fans,'' he said. ``I put chairs by the ropes and did 360s into the
crowd. Then I happened to pick up a chair and whacked somebody with
it and the roof blew off the place. Right there is where I decided.
I just told everyone, `Let's go out and bleed.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jersey All-Pro is one of the bloodier independent leagues. Its
wrestlers grapple inside wire cages or on mats strewn with tacks.
It is also one of the more sexually provocative leagues,
occasionally promoting matches in which women wrestle wearing only
string bikinis.
</P>
<P>
   A regular feature is what Iadavaia calls a ``weapons match.'' As
the spectators paid their $10 and filed into Charity Hall, they
brought along a staggering array of clubs and bludgeons and put
them in the ring for the fighters to use once they entered: hockey
sticks, baseball bats, even a kitchen sink.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Jersey All-Pro's wrestlers are local men, guys from
Bayonne and the nearby communities who think of match night as a
chance to perform in front of neighbors and friends. While they say
there is a certain pleasure in getting paid to swing a frying pan _
most make $40 to $100 a night _ many say the bouts are a way to
rise above their workaday lives and bask in acclaim they would
never otherwise enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   With its motto, ``Blood is better,'' and the occasional but very
real injuries that occur in the ring, Jersey All-Pro walks a line
between the mainstream wrestling leagues and ``ultimate'' or
``extreme fighting'' events, the no-holds-barred competitions
blending martial arts, wrestling and common street brawling.
</P>
<P>
   While Jersey All-Pro's wrestlers have suffered an array of
bumps, cuts, bruises and broken bones over the years, none of them
have been killed or seriously injured _ yet.

CLUES TURN UP AS SEARCH CONTINUES INTO THE FAILING LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER AND CARLOS MONTJE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The call came in to the Federal Aviation Administration at about
2 a.m.: An airplane piloted by John F. Kennedy Jr., expected to
arrive on Martha's Vineyard just before 10 p.m. was four hours
overdue.
</P>
<P>
   It took nearly 90 minutes longer before an initial search was
launched and his disappearance officially noted.
</P>
<P>
   By dawn Saturday, hundreds of military and civilian rescuers had
begun to scan more than 6,000 square miles of ocean and coastline,
from Long Island to Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   At about 1:30 p.m., in the surf near Aquinnah, they began to
find clues to the aircraft's fate: a headrest, bits of carpet, an
aircraft support with a wheel attached and a canvas bag with
identification from Kennedy's sister-in-law _ one of the passengers
on board the Piper Saratoga II.
</P>
<P>
   By that point, Kennedy's plane, which took off from Caldwell
Airfield in Fairfield, N.J., had been missing for more than 17
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the debris, Coast Guard officials Saturday believed
the airplane had ditched into the Atlantic, perhaps 17 miles short
of the airport in West Tisbury, Mass. Saturday evening, Kennedy and
his passengers, wife Carolyn Bessette and her sister Lauren
Bessette, were presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always hope but unfortantely when you find certain
pieces of evidence, you have to be prepared for anything that
happens,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Gary L. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The search, which included more than 20 helicopters, jets and
light airplanes and several Coast Guard cutters and boats, was
scheduled to continue through the night, with sonar equipment
brought in from a nearby federal research agency.
</P>
<P>
   But without more wreckage, or a signal from the plane's on-board
radio transponder, one officer said, trying to discover wreckage in
such a massive search field was frustrating. Kennedy also had not
filed a flight plan, a routine omission but one that may have
delayed the start of the search.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we saw were waves breaking on rocks,'' said Greg Buonomo,
a Suffolk County, N.Y., police officer who flew a Bell 206
helicopter from Islip, N.Y. to participate in the search.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing out there,'' said his partner, Steve DeMeo.
``If there is a search, you hope to find something.''
</P>
<P>
   The long delay before the start of the search prompted some
pointed questions to air force officials at a Pentagon briefing
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But Lt. Col. Steve Roark said searchers had not received a radio
signal from the downed craft and decided to follow procedure and
wait for daylight before beginning an aerial search.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at possible other landing sites . . . rather than just
sending out aircraft willy-nilly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roark also said the amount of resources devoted to the search
wasn't influenced by Kennedy's celebrity status, as the son of
President John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We treat all the searches the same,'' he said. ``There is no
difference between celebrity and non-celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   The six-seat Piper Saratoga had left an airport in New Jersey at
about 8:30 p.m. Friday and was apparently tracked by FAA radar as
it approached the airport in West Tisbury, Mass. until as late as
9:39 p.m. Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Flying conditions were considered marginal because of a haze
over the water, although visibility was mroe than three miles and
stars and a crescent moon could be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kennedy was flying under what are known as ``visual
flight rules'' and wasn't in constant communication with the
airport tower. FAA controllers likely assumed the plane had landed
safely when it left the screen, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, officials only begin receive formal warnings until
around 2 a.m., they said, when family members contacted the FAA
with news the plane was overdue.
</P>
<P>
   The first search aircraft took off around 7:30 a.m., the Air
Force said. About 15 Civil Air Patrol planes were also dispatched,
focusing on areas along the coastline and inland areas near
Kennedy's presumed flight path.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, searchers focused on the coordinates of a brief, weak
radio emergency beacon, recorded at just after 2 a.m. on Long
Island, N.Y. But that proved to be a false alarm, and by midmorning
the search had been expanded to include the entire length of the
plane's planned route from New Jersey up the coast.
</P>
<P>
   After searching for hours without results, a piece of hard data
turned up: a black canvas bag, floating in the surf near Aquinnah
shortly after noon. A group of friends on the beach spotted the
luggage.
</P>
<P>
   The bag's ID tag contained a Morgan Stanley business card that
bore the name Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible sinking feeling,'' said Damon Seligson, 30,
a Boston lawyer who said he swam out to retrieve the luggage. ``I
felt my heart burst out of my chest, it was just terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The find helped direct searchers to areas much closer to
Martha's Vineyard; by evening, authorities said they had
concentrated on an area 17 miles southwest of the island, where a
debris field had begun to surface.
</P>
<P>
   Another grim find came around 1:30 p.m. when a Coast Guard crew
working in a small boat near the coast of Aquinnah found pieces of
carpet and the headrest. Coast Guard Lt. Gary L. Jones said the
items were ``consistent with a plane crash.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones also said bits of identifiable luggage had been found, but
he would not give specifics.
</P>
<P>
   In an ironic twist, the wreckage was found less than a mile from
the estate of Kennedy's late mother, Jacqueline Kenn

<TEXT>
<P>
   HYANNIS PORT, Mass. _ Members of the Kennedy family gathered at
their summer home here Saturday to pray and await word from a
massive search for a missing airplane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr.,
his wife and sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   A piece of luggage and what appeared to be airplane parts,
dragged from the surf by beachgoers on the western tip of the
nearby island of Martha's Vineyard, appeared to be grim and
undeniable confirmation that Kennedy's single-engine plane had
crashed into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old son of former President Kennedy was reported
missing early Saturday on a flight from Essex County Airport in
Fairfield, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Also aboard the plane, which Kennedy was piloting, were his
wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and Lauren Bessette, her elder
sister, according to officials and a family spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   John and Carolyn Kennedy were on their way here to attend the
wedding of his cousin, Rory Kennedy, youngest daughter of the late
Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, who like his brother the president was
assassinated in the 1960s. The wedding was postponed.
</P>
<P>
   The mood inside the Kennedy compound here was somber but
hopeful, said Brian O'Connor, a family spokesman. He said three
Catholic priests were present and that a mass was held for family
members Saturday morning on the porch of the home of Ethel Kennedy,
Robert Kennedy's widow.
</P>
<P>
   Guards and barricades kept hordes of tourists and reporters
about a block away from the white houses topped with weathered gray
shingles that have served as a resort and a refuge for the extended
Kennedy family for more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the compound, an American flag flew at full mast as an
expression of hope.
</P>
<P>
   The compound had served as a family's _ and a nation's _ focal
point for tragedy in the past, and fears grew that yet more sadness
awaited the country's most prominent political clan.
</P>
<P>
   As darkness moved over the relatively calm waters west and south
of Martha's Vineyard, the Coast Guard kept up what it insisted was
a search for survivors from John Kennedy's single-engine Piper
Saratoga airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Rear Adm. Richard M. Larrabee said his service and
the Federal Aviation Administration began searching for the
aircraft shortly after midnight when members of the Kennedy family
said the plane had not arrived at an expected landing on Martha's
Vineyard Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   However, actual visual search of the area could not begin until
shortly after daylight Saturday and did not focus on the waters
near Martha's Vineyard until after the luggage and debris conformed
to be from the plane were spotted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a debris field that really is the center of our
search, but we're searching an area probably from Woods Hole (on
the coast of the Massachusetts mainland) south about 10 to 15 miles
south of Martha's Vineyard,'' Larrabee told a news conference in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee said a National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration
research vessel equipped with sonar was to arrive in the search
area early Saturday night and begin scanning the ocean floor for
the missing aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who recently obtained his private pilot's license, was
flying under conditions that other pilots said could be treacherous
_ haze that made it hard to distinguish land from water.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was not trained in instrument-assisted flying procedures
and would have been forced to rely on his visual perception of the
terrain as he approached Martha's Vineyard in the 300-horsepower,
six-passenger aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy plane took off from the Fairfield airport at 8:30
p.m. EDT Friday and was due to land on Martha's Vineyard at 10:30,
according to the Coast Guard. Kennedy had not filed a flight plan,
and none was expected for that kind of trip, according to the
Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee said FAA records indicated radar had tracked Kennedy's
plane as far as Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   He reportedly had planned to drop off Miss Bessette at Martha's
Vineyard before proceeding on with his wife to Hyannis Port.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a self-described love of privacy not unlike that of his
mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, John Kennedy Jr. had been in
the nation's limelight for most of his life.
</P>
<P>
   He became an enduring symbol of national grief when, as a
3-year-old toddler known as ``John-John,'' he was caught by
television cameras saluting the flag-draped coffin of his father,
the slain president.
</P>
<P>
   When he failed the New York bar examination, dated movie stars,
worked in a New York district attorney's office and got married, it
was always in front of the news media.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, People Magazine proclaimed him the ``sexiest man
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Only his Sept. 21, 1996 wedding, in the seclusion of Georgia's
Cumberland Island, was private.
</P>
<P>
   Although often mentioned as a potential political candidate who
might carry on the legacy of his father and uncles, Robert and
Edward, he chose journalism instead and founded George magazine,
which blended politics and celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was receiving reports on the search at his
weekend retreat at Camp David, according to the White House press
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our prayers and thoughts are with the families of those on
board,'' press secretary Joe Lockhart said in a statement.

THE HOPE AND SORROW OF THE KENNEDYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another call late in the night. Another stab of bad news,
striking, once again, in a time of celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The lives and deaths of the Kennedy family, which have so deeply
colored the latter half of the American century, embodied an
extraordinary blend of tragedy and hope. Joseph Kennedy Jr.'s plane
went down in August 1944, when World War II was being won. Kathleen
Kennedy died in 1948, also in a plane crash, on her way to tell her
father of her new love. John Kennedy was killed in 1963 as he
prepared confidently for his reelection campaign. Robert Kennedy
was shot on the night he won the 1968 California primary. Michael
Kennedy was said to have been rebounding from personal difficulties
when he died in a ski accident in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Even after so many dark days in years past, the word out of the
Kennedy compound Saturday was one of optimism. The family was
determined, until there was proof to the contrary, to believe that
some miracle might deliver the occupants of the small plane to
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Optimism against heavy odds was a characteristic of this Kennedy
in particular. Weaned on the nation's nightmare _ he was two days
short of his third birthday when his father was killed _ John Jr.
focused as an adult on communicating to others the joy he said he
found in politics.
</P>
<P>
   His magazine George showed it was possible to be lively and
irreverent but still largely positive. His last editor's letter
praised Senators John McCain and Russell Feingold not so much for
the substance of their campaign reform bill as for their courage in
pushing it against heavy opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have heroes among us,'' Kennedy wrote. ``While we at
George share your skepticism about many in Washington, we've always
believed that political leaders can inspire a sense of pride and
possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Pride there can be for the Kennedy family, that the president's
son and namesake navigated a most difficult course with good humor,
a measure of dignity _ and optimism. But the great sense of
possibility that John F. Kennedy Jr. carried within him is
apparently lost in the warm waters off Martha's Vineyard and will
not see a new millennium.

 &HT;    Van de Velde stays step ahead at British
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ Everything logical vanished Saturday at
the Carnoustie Golf Links. The world's No. 1 player stumbled at the
finish and a Frenchman whom no one can describe without a search
engine made a birdie putt from somewhere out on the North Sea.
</P>
<P>
   With one round to play in the 128th British Open, Jean Van de
Velde, 33, is managing what seemed highly unlikely. Instead of
collapsing under the pressure of a major championship, Van de Velde
is gaining in strength. He expanded his lead to five shots Saturday
with a 1-under-par 70 to assume a commanding position at even-par
213.
</P>
<P>
   It's the largest 54-hole lead in the British Open since Tom
Lehman led by six shots entering the final round at Royal Lytham in
1996. Lehman won by two shots. The big question is: Can Van de
Velde, a newcomer to such lofty status and 18 holes from a
life-changing experience, hang in there?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, many people have asked me that,'' said Van de Velde,
who was a Sunday-Monday qualifier. ``I'm just going to go out there
and do my best to enjoy it. I know that there's a lot better
players than me who had an even more commanding lead and who have
lost. I'm just going to try and focus on my game and try not to
beat myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Just when common sense indicated a back-up by Van de Velde
seemed in order Saturday _ what does the guy think this is, the
Paris Four-Ball? _ he drained a 70-foot putt for birdie at the 14th
hole, then made a 45-footer at the 18th. The ghost of Tom Watson
couldn't have done it any better. Everytime you looked up, the
Frenchman was getting up and down or draining a putt for birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Tied for second place at 5-over 218 are American Justin Leonard,
the 1997 British Open champion, who had a 71; and Australian Craig
Parry, whose 5-under 67 is the lowest of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   American Tiger Woods, meanwhile, double-bogeyed the 17th to
finish at 74 for 7-over 220, increasing the size of his final-round
task. Also at 220 are South African David Frost (71) and Scotland's
Andrew Coltart (72). Australian Greg Norman, the 44-year-old twice
winner of the Open Championship, bogeyed his final two holes for 75
and is at 221 with Argentina's Angel Cabrera (77).
</P>
<P>
   Conditions that remain difficult, despite a warming trend late
Saturday afternoon and some lessened wind that dropped the stroke
average to 75.6, undoubtedly increase the chance of wide stroke
swings today. Woods is counting on a low number and some trouble
finding its way to the thus far unscathed Van de Velde.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way I can go out and shoot a number where he stays
at even par and I can beat him,'' Woods said. ``It's that hard a
golf course. I need to rely on him, hopefully, coming back at me a
little bit, and we'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   If things continue in this manner, today Van de Velde, who
stands 40th on the European Order of Merit, will become the first
Frenchman to win the Open Championship since Arnaud Massy in 1907
at Hoylake, England.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe since Van de Velde had not secured a spot until he
qualified Monday with scores of 67-67, there is no real pressure at
all. Using 23 putts Saturday, he played as though a veteran to such
major championship wars. His closest thing to legitimate attention
was a second-place finish at Loch Lomond three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the most pressure (is) playing with my friends sometime
when I've got a 3-footer to win,'' he said. ``What kind of pressure
can you get here? It is the biggest tournament ever in the world
and I'm in there and I'm a bit ahead of everybody. So what can
happen? I can lose it or I can win it. Either way, I'm having a
good time. That's the main thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Scotland's Colin Montgomerie, while respectful of the leader's
game, said his inner strength has not yet been fully examined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we don't know, and he doesn't know until he has
been there, is how he can cope with the situation now,''
Montgomerie said. ``Now it's not about swinging the golf club for
Jean. It's nothing to do with technique and it's nothing to do with
golf. It's all about what's in his head right now. And if he can
cope with that situation, he can remain up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Norman, at eight shots back after a 75, called himself
``absolutely'' in contention. Unfortunately, he knows all too well
about a big lead vanishing in a major, having squandered a 6-shot
lead after 54 holes of the 1996 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody 8, 7 or 6-over has a definite shot,'' said Norman, who
made a miraculous bogey at the 17th, almost holing out from a
greenside bunker after driving into the burn. ``You've just got to
make the putts and get some breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   The man to watch closely could be Leonard, who started the final
round at Royal Troon two years ago also five shots back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just pleased to have a chance to win the tournament,''
Leonard said. ``That was my goal at the beginning of the week.

WEDDING FESTIVITIES TURN TO GRIM VIGIL IN HYANNISPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE AND CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HYANNISPORT, Mass. _ The clan has always come to their sprawling
and storied compound here to celebrate or to mourn what matriarch
Rose Kennedy once described as the agony and the ecstasy of her
family's so public life.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, it was a particularly poignant clash of those two
extremes.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of family members had gathered in the intense sunshine of
a midsummer weekend to celebrate the wedding of Robert F. Kennedy's
youngest daughter, Rory. But soon, the festivities turned into a
vigil, with the family praying they would not have to hold yet
another funeral.
</P>
<P>
   The waiting began in the earliest hours of the morning, just
hours after guests had gone to bed following the rehearsal dinner,
with a phone call alerting Senator Ted Kennedy that his nephew's
plane had disappeared. At dawn, a friend visiting the compound
described the mood as ``very worried, very somber.''
</P>
<P>
   By midmorning, with an American flag and several abandoned white
wedding tents flapping in a strong offshore breeze, the family
gathered for an impromptu mass on Ethel Kennedy's porch, praying
for the missing and for the bride and groom.
</P>
<P>
   There, offering solace, were the same three priests who only 19
months ago presided at Michael Kennedy's funeral _ one who said the
last rites for Rose Kennedy, another, the officiant at RFK's
funeral, the third, the priest who married the missing, John F.
Kennedy Jr. and his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   At the gates of the compound, gawkers arrived in the early
morning to catch a glimpse of the white dress or celebrity guests,
only to be told that the wedding had been postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1 p.m., Sen. Kennedy phoned a close friend and said the
family was holding out ``hope upon hope that a miracle might
happen.'' But, the friend said, Kennedy's voice sounded tired and
flat.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, who had planned to go to Martha's Vineyard for an
early afternoon fundraiser, paced the lawn amid tiny fourth
generation Kennedys. JFK Jr's cousin, former US Rep. Joseph P.
Kennedy II, sat on the porch talking to friends, and all day long,
pairs of cousins and siblings took to the beach, as they had the
winter morning of Michael's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   The 275 wedding guests had been called in early morning and told
that the wedding was postponed indefinitely. But out of confusion,
stunned grief _ or perhaps simply because they had other things on
their mind _ family members had forgotten to call off the caterers,
who arrived at 3 p.m. with two trucks of food for a 6 p.m. wedding.
Soon flowers, too, began arriving, but it was unclear whether they
were in grief or in anticipation of the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, as the family waited for some word, the scene
came to resemble happier gatherings here, as the bride and her
husband-to-be, Mark Bailey, came out with about 20 family members
to fly kites on the immense lawn, site of so many photographed
family football games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of children running around, which always seems
to change the atmosphere,'' said Brian O'Connor, spokesman for the
former Congressman. ``People are happy to see one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Would-be wedding guests who came by in the early morning hours
left quietly in the afternoon as family members began to gather.
William Kennedy Smith, JFK's cousin, arrived at Logan Airport.
Caroline Kennedy, John's older sister, was on a rafting vacation in
the West, and had not been planning to attend the wedding.
President Clinton had reportedly telephoned her to offer her
assistance in flying back east.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a town where locals have refused to gape at the frequent
Kennedy sightings over the years, people couldn't help but comment
how the family seemed to have such a run of bad luck, or as most
called it Saturday, a curse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to use that phrase....but it just falls all
around them,'' said Jane Tyson, sitting at Four Seas Ice Cream,
which is still known as the place where Jackie Kennedy used to
borrow a few dollars from Secret Service agents to buy cones for
Caroline and John-John. ``This should have been a very happy day.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, on bicycles, one girl explained to her younger friend
that there wouldn't be any wedding. ``He's dead,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The wedding guests were to gather for Rory, who seemed
especially due for a happy occasion _ and marked by tragedy. Her
mother was pregnant with her when Robert F. Kennedy was killed in
Los Angeles in 1968. It was Rory who cradled her big brother
Michael's head as he lay dying on a Colorado ski slope on New
Year's Eve, 1997, begging him to ``Just hang on for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the family could use some hope,'' said Melissa
Lewandowski, tying yellow ribbons on telephone poles alongside the
white picket fences of the compound. ``If they saw a yellow ribbon,
they'd know the community is hoping with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps typical for a family frequently called America's
royalty, even the tragedy was a combination of celebrity watching
and sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on Martha's Vineyard Saturday looking for John-John,''
said Francine Wiener, 51, who was vacationing in Yarmouth. ``Ever
since he did that salute, the first time at his father's funeral,
I've been following him. I don't want my search for John-John to
end this way. I hope for the best, but I don't think that's going
to be the case.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 BOSTON: ... search procedures.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Asked how long the search would continue, Coast Guard Commander
Mike Lapinski said: ``A lot of things come into play. The Coast
Guard is searching for survivors, and any indications there might
have been a chance of getting out and surviving and potentially
being in the water would lead them to continue. The more signs
there are, the longer we search.''
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Rear Admiral Richard Larrabee said Kennedy's
celebrity status had no bearing on the intensity of the search.
``Our efforts are consistent with the way we would search for
anyone who was lost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 1 p.m., the search shifted almost exclusively to
the waters off Martha's Vineyard when beachgoers found items linked
to Kennedy's plane.
</P>
<P>
   Erin McCarthy, 31, of Boston, was sitting on the beach with her
friends when she spotted something in the water. Thinking it might
be debris from the crash, her friend Damon Seligson, 30, a Boston
lawyer, swam out to get it.
</P>
<P>
   It was a black canvas bag packed with clothes, a bathing suit,
cosmetics, a hair dryer with an ID tag that had Lauren Bessette
business cards from Morgan Stanley, McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible sinking feeling,'' said Seligson. ``I felt
my heart burst out of my chest, it was just terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Campbell, 34, a private pilot from Greenwich, Conn., said
he saw the nose wheel and a part called a ``wheel pant'' from a
single-engine plane washed up on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, searchers turned up a headrest and part of a
plane support called a strut, said Coast Guard Lt. Craig Jaramillo.
</P>
<P>
   The plane Kennedy was flying was built in June 1995. He
purchased it used from Minir Hussain, a 39-year-old native of
Pakistan who runs a furniture factory in New Jersey. Hussain sold
it through a broker and said he believed Kennedy paid about
$300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hussain said he was at the Essex County Airport on Friday night
and noticed the plane was out of its hangar. He said he immediately
became worried when he was told Kennedy was going to be flying on
his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a risky situation for him to be flying without an
instructor because he was not instument-rated to fly on his own,''
Hussain said in a telephone interview. ``I know that John was a
very good pilot, everyone knew that. But I immediately began to
worry because the conditions were not that good.''
</P>
<P>
   Hussian said he had just landed his own plane at the airport and
believed that the visibility was not ideal, around six miles. While
it was still clear enough to take off without instruments from the
airport, he felt that it was ``too risky'' for someone without
instrutment certification to do so.
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking federal transportation offical said the National
Transportation Safety Board had pulled the maintenance records of
the plane and found it to be well cared for.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently Kennedy did not fill his tanks prior to departure,
but fuel records obtained by the NTSB indicate there were at least
90 gallons on board, plenty of fuel for a single-engine plane to
make that trip. However, the plane has two fuel tanks, one in each
wing, and a pilot must remember to switch from one to the other
before fuel runs out.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the proximity of the wreckage to Jacqueline Onassis'
former Vineyard home, the official speculated that Kennedy may have
been ``buzzing'' the property that he and his sister now own and
was caught in a thermal updraft by the Gay Head cliffs.
</P>
<P>
   A thermal updraft would cause the plane to rise suddenly and the
normal response of the pilot would be to push the yoke down to
lower the nose. Once the plane cleared the updraft, the plane could
suddenly dive. At low altitudes, such a move could be catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't count the number of times I have seen low-time pilots,
with family or friends on board, showing off by buzzing their house
and get into trouble,'' the source said. ``It is a mistake many
low-time pilots make.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane itself was not considered particularly difficult to
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The handling characteristics are very benign,'' said Warrent
Morningstar, director of media relations for the Aircraft Owners
and Pilots Association, a general aviation lobbying group. ``It is
not the sort of plane you would want to learn to fly in, but it
should not be a handful for a low-time pilot who had proper
training in the aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls began flooding into the Kennedy compound around 7
a.m. Saturday. President Clinton, who was spending the weekend at
Camp David, learned of the disappearance from his chief of staff,
John Podesta, and telephoned Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Andrew
Cuomo, the head of Housing and Urban Development, who is married to
Kerry Kennedy, a daughter of RFK.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called JFK Jr.'s sister, Caroline Schlossberg, who
was reportedly on vacation out West. She was expected to join the
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our prayers and thoughts are with the families of those on
board,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's disappearance came one day before the 30th
anniversary of the day Edward Kennedy's car went off a bridge at
Chappaquiddick, killing passenger Mary Jo Kopechne on a tiny island
adjacent to Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in May 1998, three weeks after he received his
pilot's license, Kennedy told USA Today that none of his relatives
could be persuaded to fly with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only person I've been able to get to go up with me, who
looks forward to it as much as I do, is my wife,'' he said.
``Whenever we want to get away, we can just get in a plane and fly
off.''

<P>
   BOSTON -- John F. Kennedy Jr., who crawled out from under his
father's Oval Office desk into a life of tragedy-tinged celebrity,
was feared dead Saturday along with his wife and her sister when
the small plane he was piloting apparently crashed off Martha's
Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Hope that the glamorous and free-spirited member of the nation's
most chronicled political family had simply made an unscheduled
landing dimmed when wreckage and luggage were found off Philbin's
Beach at the eastern-most end of the island. A short walk down the
beach is the Vineyard home that Kennedy and his sister inherited
from their mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   No bodies were found, and an intensive search involving the
Coast Guard, Air Force, Air National Guard, National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, Civil Air Patrol, and scores of private
vessels continued into Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said it was too early to speculate on the cause of
the crash, but preliminary efforts are focusing on Kennedy's
becoming disoriented because of poor visibility and losing control
of the plane, fuel mismangement, and loss of control after doing a
fly-by of the family property.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 38, a onetime Manhattan prosecutor who left the law to
become publisher of ``George'' magazine, was accompanied by his
wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and her older sister Lauren Bessette.
They were aboard his single-engine Piper Saratoga II HP, a plane
the novice pilot had purchased just 10 weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and Carolyn Bessette planned to drop off her sister on
Martha's Vineyard then head to Hyannis for the wedding of a cousin,
Rory Kennedy, daughter of the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy. The
wedding scheduled for Saturday was postponed, and plans for a
celebratory Mass were replaced by the familiar and familial sound
of mournful prayers.
</P>
<P>
   The entourage had set out about 8:30 p.m. Friday from Essex
County Airport in Caldwell, N.J., and was expected to land at
Martha's Vineyard Airport by 10 p.m. Kennedy was not required to
file a flight plan, and had not done so.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who received his solo pilot license last year, took off
into a hazy sky from the New Jersey airport, and some pilots
questioned whether he was experienced enough to fly under such
conditions. Kennedy was not certified to fly solely via
instruments, and would have had to rely on visual cues.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Bailey, an experienced private pilot who also had planned
to fly from New Jersey to Martha's Vineyard Friday night, changed
his mind when he saw sky. ``I felt it was too hazy and I didn't
want to chance it over open water,'' said Bailey, who said he saw
the Kennedy group at the airport, with Kennedy arriving in a white
convertible and wearing a baseball hat backwards.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said he noticed Kennedy was limping around the plane
during his preflight check; Kennedy had injured his foot several
weeks ago in a paragliding accident.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy made no voice contact with the Martha's Vineyard
Airport, but his six-seat, red-and-white plane was last spotted on
radar at 9:39 p.m. on what appeared to be a final approach to the
landing strip.
</P>
<P>
   A review of radar records showed the plane was 17 miles
west-southwest of the airport at an altitude of 2,200 feet. On the
next radar pass, 12 seconds later, the plane had dropped to 1,300
feet. Twelve seconds later, the plane was nowhere to be seen,
sources with the Federal Aviation Administration said.
</P>
<P>
   The precipitous drop in altitude apparently did not trigger
action by flight controllers because, without a flight plan and
without voice contact, they had no reason to pay the aircraft any
heed and might not have even noticed the drop, according to FAA
officials and authorities on flight procedures.
</P>
<P>
   While family and friends held vigil at the Kennedys' Hyannisport
compound, the feared death of the man known to the world as
``John-John'' added a sad new chapter to a family history in which
glory and sorrow alternate like day and night.
</P>
<P>
   The victories have come mainly from voters, while the losses
have come from even more capricious sources, including assassins,
drugs, and the trees of Aspen. Even before Friday's apparent plane
crash, the family has suffered the fate of Icarus before: Kennedy's
uncle, Navy Lt. Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., died in 1944 when his bomber
exploded over England; his aunt, Kathleen (Kennedy) Harrington, was
killed in 1948 when the plane she was aboard crashed in the
mountains of France.
</P>
<P>
   Fears about John F. Kennedy Jr., his 33-year-old wife, and her
sister began in earnest sometime after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:15 a.m., a friend of the Kennedys called the Coast Guard
station in Woods Hole to say Kennedy and Bessette were late. Woods
Hole called the Coast Guard's Boston station, which in turn called
the FAA. The FAA and Air Force then began calling other airports to
see if the plane had landed somewhere else or perhaps never took
off.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, a satellite picked up an emergency beacon
signal off Montauk, Long Island. No immediate action was taken
because it is standard procedure to wait for additional beacon
``hits'' to pinpoint the location of a downed airplane, said Coast
Guard Petty Officer Todd Burgun in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   After a second beacon signal was received, a ``case'' was opened
at 3:28 a.m. by the Air Force's Air Rescue Coordination Center,
which oversees searches for missing aircraft. However, it was not
known whether the signal had come from Kennedy's plane because the
beacon did not have a ``signature'' to indicate its source.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:30 a.m. a 41-foot Coast Guard utility vessel began
searching the area off Montauk, followed by another utility boat
and several larger vessels in the predawn hours. They found
nothing. At dawn, the Civil Air Patrol of the US Air Force joined
the search with 15 single-engine planes, focusing almost
exclusively along the Long Island coastline.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the sky were two Coast Guard H60 Jayhawk helicopters, a
Coast Guard Falcon jet, and huge C-130 from the Air National Guard,
which provided in-flight air traffic control of the search planes.
The same plane was involved in the aftermath of the crash of TWA
flight 800, which plunged into nearby waters three years ago to the
day.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 10 hours, the search was spread over a nearly
1,000-square-mile area between the two airports, though much of it
was focused around Montauk, Coast Guard officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether a rescue effort might have been more effective if
begun sooner, Lt. Col. Steve Roark of the US Air Force said:
``Would it have made a difference? I don't think so, because it was
nighttime, and because of our standard search procedures.''

   ATLANTA _ There was scant information on the Web early Saturday
morning, when the news broke that John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane was
missing. CNN, ABCNews.com and MSNBC all had stories reporting the
plane missing, but didn't elaborate
</P>
<P>
   much beyond that. The local Massachusetts newspapers, The Boston
Globe (www.boston.com) and the Boston Herald (www.bostonherald.com)
also lacked early original reporting and relied on wire stories.
The early lack of coverage from local news outlets was odd,
particularly in light of the wedding of Rory Kennedy in
Hyannisport, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, as more information became known, the major
news organizations began posting additional information and
background stories. However, they were careful not to make any
definitive statements other than that Kennedy and his family were
missing.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Herald, which has zealously followed the Kennedy
family's each and every move for years, had a variety of stories
posted by 5 p.m. A chilling AP story titled ``Dressed for a
Wedding, a Compound Braces for Trouble,'' was filled with tragic
details. One poignant scene depicts 50 family members and three
priests huddled on the porch of the Kennedy family compound saying
Mass and praying for the safety of the loved ones as well as the
bride and her fiancee.

BUSH'S SEEMINGLY SPONTANEOUS RACE HAS BEEN WELL PLANNED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The overflow crowds that turned out in June for
Gov. George W. Bush's California presidential fund-raising swing
surpassed his campaign staff's wildest imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 2,000 Californians packed into some of the $1,000-a-plate
dinners, requiring extra tables to be set up in a hall in
traditionally Democratic San Francisco. A scalper tried to sell a
ticket to one event for $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Governor Bush first ran for (Texas) governor in 1994, we
had a very exclusive event for him in Los Angeles. Only 25 people.
The reason it was so exclusive was we couldn't get any more people
to attend,'' said Bush's Golden State finance chairman, Brad
Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it appears that Bush's bid for the Republican
presidential nomination _ unprecedented in its early popularity _
ignited spontaneously in the eight months after his landslide
re-election as Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's campaign success is actually based on more than two
years of strategic planning and preparation as his aides and allies
built a network of potential supporters and financiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of work went into it. It didn't just happen,'' said
Heinz Prechter, a fund-raiser for Bush in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The result of all that planning was the creation of a seemingly
unbeatable front-runner six months before the first primary vote is
cast and a full year before the nominating conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush leads every poll. Politicians and political financiers
journeyed to Austin earlier this year to meet Bush as if on a quest
for a political grail. When Bush finally ventured out of Texas last
month to Iowa and New Hamphsire, masses surrounded him.
</P>
<P>
   Then the money poured in, a record $37 million that has allowed
Bush to forgo federal matching funds and their spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   A major source of the success was a program called the Pioneers,
which recruited people willing to raise $100,000 to earn the right
to adopt that frontier moniker. More than 350 people volunteered
for the program and almost 120 had reached their goal by June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with more than a dozen Bush insiders across the
country produced a picture of a campaign that ``evolved,'' as they
liked to say, from a network of Bush friends from Yale and Harvard,
as well as his father's political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   At the center was a small group led by political consultant Karl
Rove. Others in the inner circle included longtime friend and
finance chairman Don Evans, administrative aide Joe Allbaugh and
press secretary Karen Hughes. Even within that circle, many secrets
are known only by Bush and Rove, they said.
</P>
<P>
   With Rove serving as the point man, the group built a national
network that would allow Bush's presidential campaign to burst onto
the scene fully developed when he announced the formation of an
exploratory committee in March.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the insiders said, encouraged everyone he met _ including
his own staff _ to view him as a potential presidential contender
without ever committing to a race. Bush did not want to get too far
out front with his presidential bid, fearing it might hurt his
state re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He also wanted to defer a final decision on running because of
what friends described as the ``gulp factor,'' the gasp before
making a giant step that could change his personal life forever.
But underneath, few ever doubted that he would run.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes tells the story of Bush not making a final decision to
run until after his inaugural church service this past January.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minister had a very compelling call to make the most of
your life. Afterward, the governor said, `I think he was talking to
me,''' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a tendency to portray Bush as almost an
accidental candidate, someone whom the tide of history has swept
toward greatness and the presidency. But Bush has been a meticulous
personal strategist, planning his future for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after becoming the managing general partner of the
Texas Rangers in 1989, he admitted to a Time reporter that his role
in the team was part of a plan to someday run for Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest liability in Texas is the question, `What's the boy
ever done?''' Bush said. ```So he's got a famous father and a ran a
small oil company. He could be riding on daddy's name if he ran for
office.' Now I can say, `I've done something _ here it is.'''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush and his friends say there was never a grand scheme
for his political career, part of Bush's success this year came
from taking the tested tactics and themes of his two governor's
races to a national stage.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, as Bush prepared for his first governor's race in
1993, Rove tried to build an aura of a draft-Bush movement. He
announced that 10 of 13 Republican state senators had signed a
letter urging Bush to run for governor in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Rove similarly this year started a drumbeat for Bush's
presidential bid by encouraging elected officials in various states
to write letters urging Bush to seek the presidency. Bush insiders
say the initial effort was so successful that many of the later
letter-writing campaigns occurred spontaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's friends said there was never any talk of him running for
president during his first two years as governor, but that quickly
changed after 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had gained a great deal of national exposure as co-chairman
of the 1996 Republican National Convention in San Diego. The
convention's host committee chairman, Gerald Parsky, is now Bush's
California campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sen. Bob Dole's presidential defeat, following that of
Bush's father in 1992, had Republican activists looking for a
winner for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush had the advantage of being from a big state, having a
presidential name and, at the same time, being a fresh new face,''
said one Bush associate.
</P>
<P>
   During the first half of 1997, Bush started gingerly testing the
waters with political trips to California, South Carolina, Florida
and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Then-South Carolina Gov. David Beasley set off the first hard
speculation about a Bush presidential run during Bush's visit in
March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here expect him to be a top contender for the
presidential nomination,'' Beasley declared. ``He's just a natural
fit.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(More) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush &UR;  &LR; dismissed Beasley's comments when he returned to Austin:
``This is all a bunch of national people, who obviously have got a
lot of time on their hands, trying to put words and thoughts in my
head.''
</P>
<P>
   But the following month, Bush encouraged speculation again when
he spoke before the staunchly conservative California Republican
Assembly. In accepting the Ronald Reagan Freedom Fighter Award,
Bush talked of the need to help ``godless children.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush was wooing the California conservatives, former
Republican National Committee Chairman Rich Bond was traveling
through Iowa making contacts on the governor's behalf for a 2000
bid. When word got out, Rove quickly distanced Bush from the
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in June 1997, the Zogby American poll came out with a
report that 21 percent of the Republicans surveyed supported Bush
as their 2000 presidential nominee. Not only were Bush's numbers
up, but the poll marked the first time that he had become a popular
name, ahead of such party names as Colin Powell and Jack Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said Bush's lead in the June 1997 poll was the first
indication Bush had that he could be a serious presidential
contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked at me and said, `You've got to be kidding me,'''
Hughes recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he was now thinking of running, Bush still demurred in
public, calling the 2000 race the ``famous future question.'' He
insisted that the only thing on his mind was re-election in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But by August, one of Bush's friends from the graduate business
school at Harvard, Al Hubbard of Indiana, had talked Bush into
participating in the Midwest Republican Leadership Conference. Rove
privately touted the event to national political reporters as
Bush's presidential coming out.
</P>
<P>
   The speech was poorly received, leading Bush again to lower
expectations about himself as a potential presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was invited to go to a fund-raiser,'' Bush told Austin
reporters afterward. ``I hadn't thought through the ramifications
of some national beauty contest.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, Bush declared that he had ``not made a decision
to run for president,'' and said his only concern was Texas and
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the scenes, Bush's operatives were already planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some early meetings to talk about (running for
president) in generic terms,'' Prechter said. ``I wanted to make
sure after 1996 that we could get behind a leader in our party who
could unite people.''
</P>
<P>
   Prechter said Bush ``wasn't all convinced early on that this is
what he wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Gov. John Engler, a past chairman of the Republican
Governor's Association, was building support for Bush among other
governors while also trying to get Bush to commit to a run.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the party, governors like me, wanted somebody who
could both win the campaign and then govern according to a set of
principles that we need to move power out of Washington to the
local communities,'' Engler said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his early field tests, Bush often traveled across the
country to help Republican gubernatorial candidates raise money for
races in their states.
</P>
<P>
   Bush finance chairman Evans said the trips were not part of a
specific network-building effort, but added, ``It didn't hurt. It
was a chance for him to deliver his positive, hopeful message.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, a re-election planning meeting turned into a
presidential strategy session, as former Republican U.S. Rep. Tom
Tauke urged Bush to go ahead and form a presidential exploratory
committee. Tauke, who was secretly slated to become Bush's
presidential campaign manager, thought Bush was waiting too long to
announce, insiders said.
</P>
<P>
   But when Bush found out about the tone of the meeting, he
brought it to a halt. Some said Bush thought such presidential talk
was premature in the midst of his re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bush began to interview potential policy advisers that
summer. Hubbard set up a meeting with domestic policy adviser
Lawrence Lindsey at the Governor's Mansion, and Bush met his future
foreign policy adviser, Condoleezza Rice, at his father's home.
Rice had been an adviser to the Bush White House.
</P>
<P>
   If the gun for Bush's presidential bullet was back-to-back GOP
defeats in previous elections, the trigger was his 1998 victory
over Democrat Garry Mauro.
</P>
<P>
   Although he won in a landslide, the appearances of President
Clinton, his wife Hillary and Vice President Al Gore at Mauro
fund-raisers enhanced the image nationally that Bush's victory was
gigantic rather than a a political cakewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that really made a difference was those re-election
numbers that showed his support was not only deep, but very
broad,'' Freeman said.
</P>
<P>
   During the second week of December, a small group of Bush's
Texas advisers and Tauke met in the private quarters of the
Governor's Mansion. They decided to take public steps toward a run.
</P>
<P>
   If the support was there, they decided, the newly elected
governor should announce an exploratory committee in March, as Bush
eventually did.
</P>
<P>
   (Tauke left Bush's campaign before his role was ever formalized
or made public. One insider said Bush and Tauke just could not
agree on how to run the campaign.)
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most important decision that was made was to create
the Pioneers fund-raising organization. It was a method of raising
a lot of money without holding traditional events. The hope was to
make Bush the financial front-runner by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   More than 350 people around the country pledged to become
Pioneers. As of the end of June, almost 120 had made it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pioneers have raised well over $10 million. So it has been
a significant part of the success story,'' said Pioneers program
chairman Jim Francis of Dallas. ``This is a political movement that
is for real and very enthusiastic for Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Nash, a San Marcos auto dealer and a Pioneer, said the
$100,000 goal seemed difficult but was not because the candidate
was Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sell cars for a living. I wish all my products were as easy
to sell as George Bush,'' Nash said.

 &HT;    KENNEDY CLAN WAITS AND PRAYS AS SEARCH CONTINUES
 &HT;    With KENNEDY-TOWN.
 &HT;    By BOB DART and JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   HYANNIS PORT, Mass. _ Members of the Kennedy family gathered at
their summer home here Saturday to pray and await word from a
massive search for a missing airplane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr.,
his wife and sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   A piece of luggage and what appeared to be airplane parts,
dragged from the surf by beachgoers on the western tip of the
nearby island of Martha's Vineyard, appeared to be grim and
undeniable confirmation that Kennedy's single-engine plane had
crashed into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old son of former President Kennedy was reported
missing early Saturday on a flight from Essex County Airport in
Fairfield, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Also aboard the plane, which Kennedy was piloting, were his
wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and Lauren Bessette, her elder
sister, according to officials and a family spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   John and Carolyn Kennedy were on their way here to attend the
wedding of his cousin, Rory Kennedy, youngest daughter of the late
Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, who like his brother the president was
assassinated in the 1960s. The wedding was postponed.
</P>
<P>
   The mood inside the Kennedy compound here was somber but
hopeful, said Brian O'Connor, a family spokesman. He said three
Catholic priests were present and that a mass was held for family
members Saturday morning on the porch of the home of Ethel Kennedy,
Robert Kennedy's widow.
</P>
<P>
   Guards and barricades kept hordes of tourists and reporters
about a block away from the white houses topped with weathered gray
shingles that have served as a resort and a refuge for the extended
Kennedy family for more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the compound, an American flag flew at full mast as an
expression of hope.
</P>
<P>
   The compound had served as a family's _ and a nation's _ focal
point for tragedy in the past, and fears grew that yet more sadness
awaited the country's most prominent political clan.
</P>
<P>
   As darkness moved over the relatively calm waters west and south
of Martha's Vineyard, the Coast Guard kept up what it insisted was
a search for survivors from John Kennedy's single-engine Piper
Saratoga airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Rear Adm. Richard M. Larrabee said his service and
the Federal Aviation Administration began searching for the
aircraft shortly after midnight when members of the Kennedy family
said the plane had not arrived at an expected landing on Martha's
Vineyard Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   However, actual visual search of the area could not begin until
shortly after daylight Saturday and did not focus on the waters
near Martha's Vineyard until after the luggage and debris conformed
to be from the plane were spotted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a debris field that really is the center of our
search, but we're searching an area probably from Woods Hole (on
the coast of the Massachusetts mainland) south about 10 to 15 miles
south of Martha's Vineyard,'' Larrabee told a news conference in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee said a National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration
research vessel equipped with sonar was to arrive in the search
area early Saturday night and begin scanning the ocean floor for
the missing aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who recently obtained his private pilot's license, was
flying under conditions that other pilots said could be treacherous
_ haze that made it hard to distinguish land from water.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was not trained in instrument-assisted flying procedures
and would have been forced to rely on his visual perception of the
terrain as he approached Martha's Vineyard in the 300-horsepower,
six-passenger aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy plane took off from the Fairfield airport at 8:30
p.m. EDT Friday and was due to land on Martha's Vineyard at 10:30,
according to the Coast Guard. Kennedy had not filed a flight plan,
and none was expected for that kind of trip, according to the
Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee said FAA records indicated radar had tracked Kennedy's
plane as far as Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   He reportedly had planned to drop off Miss Bessette at Martha's
Vineyard before proceeding on with his wife to Hyannis Port.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a self-described love of privacy not unlike that of his
mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, John Kennedy Jr. had been in
the nation's limelight for most of his life.
</P>
<P>
   He became an enduring symbol of national grief when, as a
3-year-old toddler known as ``John-John,'' he was caught by
television cameras saluting the flag-draped coffin of his father,
the slain president.
</P>
<P>
   When he failed the New York bar examination, dated movie stars,
worked in a New York district attorney's office and got married, it
was always in front of the news media.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, People Magazine proclaimed him the ``sexiest man
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Only his Sept. 21, 1996 wedding, in the seclusion of Georgia's
Cumberland Island, was private.
</P>
<P>
   Although often mentioned as a potential political candidate who
might carry on the legacy of his father and uncles, Robert and
Edward, he chose journalism instead and founded George magazine,
which blended politics and celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was receiving reports on the search at his
weekend retreat at Camp David, according to the White House press
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our prayers and thoughts are with the families of those on
board,'' press secretary Joe Lockhart said in a statement.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John F. Kennedy Jr. was a relatively new pilot,
apparently rather cautious, flying a well-equipped and relatively
new single-engine plane.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy earned his private pilot's license on April 22, 1998,
officials of the Federal Aviation Administration said. His license
allowed him to fly single-engine planes and to carry passengers,
but not for compensation.
</P>
<P>
   He was not qualified to fly if he had to rely on instruments,
though he had been working on getting that rating. When he, his
wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and his sister-in-law, Lauren
Bessette, took off from Essex County Airport in Fairfield, N.J., on
Friday night, flying to Martha's Vineyard, the winds were light and
there were no thunderstorms, weather he was qualified to fly in.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots said that haze on the flight path could be a challenge,
because it could make a pilot lose sight of the horizon. In a turn,
a pilot who does not use instruments and who cannot see out the
windows may bank so steeply that he loses control. When making
over-water flights, most private pilots fly at a relatively high
altitude, 7,500 to 9,500 feet, so that if the engine quits, they
can glide far enough to reach land.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was known as a cautious flyer. ``If the weather was bad,
he would charter,'' said Chuck McKenna, the operations manager at
Mac Dan Aviation, a maintenance shop and charter service at the
Essex airport, where Kennedy kept the plane, a four-year-old Piper
Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when if he was at the Vineyard or Hyannis, we
would go up there and pick him up,'' McKenna said, even if that
meant leaving his own plane behind. ``If you're asking me what I
know of his flying and decision-making, I would say he'd err on the
side of caution,'' McKenna said.
</P>
<P>
   Five or six weeks ago, he said, Kennedy had hurt an ankle while
on Martha's Vineyard, and called Mac Dan to pick him up.
</P>
<P>
   A pilot who also flies from the Essex airfield said Kennedy
frequently flew with a flight instructor to Martha's Vineyard on
Friday nights, returning on Sunday nights or Monday mornings. The
instructor, the pilot said, was not aboard the Saratoga on Friday
night; he was in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, who asked not to be identified by name, said he saw
the Kennedy party preparing to depart Friday night about 8:15.
Kennedy was dressed in white slacks and T-shirt; his wife wore
black pants and a black T-shirt; her sister was wearing a beige
dress, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Kennedy's feet appeared to be injured, the pilot said,
adding that he was ``pivoting around on one spot.'' He had what
appeared from a distance to be a crutch but was not using it and
was wearing ordinary shoes on both feet, the other pilot said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's rudder is controlled with foot pedals. It was not
clear on Saturday whether Kennedy's apparent injury might have
affected his ability to control the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always said he had an instructor fly with him a lot in the
Saratoga,'' the pilot said. ``He may have been getting accustomed
to a new plane, and trying to enhance his skills, even though he
had the license.''
</P>
<P>
   An air traffic controller, also speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said Kennedy had been given clearance by the airport
tower to take off.
</P>
<P>
   Private planes commonly do not fly under air traffic control,
and Kennedy did not contact the New York Terminal Radar Approach
Control, which would be the first air traffic control office with
jurisdiction over a plane flying under instrument rules. But since
he was flying under visual flight rules, he was not required to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   Under visual flight rules, he was under no obligation to check
in if he chose to take responsibility for spotting other air
traffic and for keeping a safe distance, and if he did not need to
ask about weather conditions ahead.
</P>
<P>
   His plane carried a transponder, a device that automatically
responds to a query from FAA radar, identifying the airplane and
altitude. But for private flights like this one, the transponder
would be responding with a generic code meaning it was a general
aviation flight and not giving its precise identity. FAA
technicians Saturday were sorting through all such flights the
previous night, trying to determine which one was Kennedy's.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's Saratoga was built in June 1995, according to the
manufacturer. The model can carry six people, and there are more
than 7,500 in service, according to Chuck Suma, president of the
company. Suma said at a news conference that Kennedy had trained on
two smaller Pipers, a Warrior and an Arrow.
</P>
<P>
   The Saratoga has a single 300-horsepower, six-cylinder engine, a
little bigger than an engine in a large car. It can carry about
1,100 pounds, including people, baggage and fuel. It carries about
100 gallons. The one Kennedy was flying had a market value of
$325,000 to $350,000, Suma said.
</P>
<P>
   The previous owner of the plane Kennedy was flying, Munir
Hussain, of Hasbrouck Heights, N.J., said it was equipped with a
storm scope, which spots thunderstorms, as well as radios for
tuning in two ground-based navigation beacons simultaneously.
Hussain, a furniture manufacturer who used the Saratoga in his
business, said it had leather seats, a compact disc player and air
conditioning. It also had a ground approach warning system.

RELATIVE WHO PERSUADED SUSPECT TO SURRENDER KNOWS HIM AS `GENTLE,
KIND, LOVING'

c.1999 Houston Chronicle

<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Growing up in western Mexico, Manuela
Maturino and her siblings had only sporadic contact with their
gentle, older half-brother, Angel. As adults, they heard from him
occasionally as he drifted back and forth across the Rio Grande, in
and out of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   They knew nothing of his common-law wife. When he became a
father last spring, they had no idea.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the end, the most important thing that accused serial
killer Angel Maturino Resendez wanted in order to give himself up
was the assurance that his family could cross the Texas border with
him.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, Manuela Maturino, a nurse's aide and mother
of two who had immigrated to the United States years earlier, stood
a few steps behind Texas Rangers Sgt. Drew Carter on an
international bridge near El Paso. Carter's white cowboy hat and
the presence of Manuela were the signal to one of the most-wanted
men in the United States that it was safe to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   He stepped out of his brother's pickup and ended a six-week
manhunt by shaking the ranger's hand. Known to authorities as
Rafael Resendez-Ramirez before he gave a judge the new name last
week, he now sits in a Houston jail cell, a suspect in at least
nine slayings in Texas, Kentucky and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendez has been charged with capital murder in the
slaying of 87-year-old Leafie Mason of the East Texas town of
Hughes Springs, and could face more capital charges in the near
future. If convicted, he could face death by injection, a
punishment he likely could have avoided by giving himself up in
Mexico, which does not have the death penalty and does not
extradite citizens who could face the punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manuela and the whole family have been emotionally
traumatized. She hadn't seen him or heard from him in several
years,'' said her pastor, Troy Robinson, who sat with her during
the negotiations at her Albuquerque home and accompanied her to
Texas. ``They all remember him as a gentle, kind, loving person,
and they just couldn't believe this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was in the back of their minds that this wasn't the
right man.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the surrender drama was not the first time Maturino had come
before authorities because of her brother's involvement in a
criminal matter.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, she was subpoenaed to testify at her brother's trial in
federal court in St. Louis. He was charged with 16 counts of
immigration violations and weapons charges. He had elected to act
as his own attorney.
</P>
<P>
   In questioning his sister, then known by her married name,
Manuela Karkiewicz, Maturino Resendez did not ask any questions
that would help in his defense. Instead, he dwelled on family
secrets and how his sister, whom he called the ``perfect
Christian,'' was kept in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``But many of the truths were being hidden (about) the
defendant, isn't that true?'' Maturino Resendez asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' his sister answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many things you (have) not been told about the defendant?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-huh.''
</P>
<P>
   The family secrets centered on how the identity of Maturino
Resendez's father was hidden from other siblings. He had a
different father than the others.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino said she had asked her grandmother and mother about her
half-brother's father, but was never told.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendez ended with rambling questions about how he was
trusted with family secrets while his siblings were left in the
dark.
</P>
<P>
   In his closing arguments, he praised and apologized to his
sister for having to endure the embarrassment of testifying at her
brother's trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one witness that I feel bad about ... Manuela
Karkiewicz,'' he said, adding that it was ``a situation that she
was not even supposed to be put in'' and that she ``didn't deserve
to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(She is) married to a good man,'' Maturino Resendez continued.
``He works Sunday, and that's not allowed. A very good lady, she
doesn't ask questions. She does what she is supposed to do to be a
good homemaker. She has trained to be what I consider to be a
perfect lady, a perfect woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never was told that I was supposed to try to hurt somebody,
especially like Manuela Karkiewicz. I was supposed to protect her.
If I had to, I was supposed to lie to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendez was convicted and sentenced to 30 months in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding a theme she would repeat 10 years later, Manuela
Maturino also said at the 1989 trial that she barely knew her
half-brother.
</P>
<P>
   She testified that she first met him when he came to live with
the family in Rodeo, in Mexico's Durango state, when he was about
15. She said her half-brother had been reared before that in the
state of Puebla by an aunt and uncle.
</P>
<P>
   She said Maturino Resendez stayed with the family for less than
a year, then left on his own, and she did not see him again for 10
or 12 years. Four years before the St. Louis trial, she saw him in
El Reno, Okla., where he was serving an 18-month sentence for
immigration violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not see each other very regularly as adults, I
think,'' said Carter, the ranger who befriended Maturino. ``There's
no doubt that they loved one another and cared for one another, but
the frequency of their visits was very minimal.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson has known Maturino since she joined the Hope Chapel
Foursquare Gospel Church, a Pentecostal congregation, seven years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said Maturino, who was divorced from her husband last
year, showed up at his home one day in mid-June. She told him
authorities had contacted her, looking for her half-brother.
Robinson and his wife, Jeanne, prayed with her. He agreed to sit in
on meetings between Maturino and officials from the FBI, U.S.
Marshals Service and the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, Maturino received a phone call from her brother,
Florentino Maturino, a minister who lives near Ciudad Juarez,
Mexico. He told her that their brother, Angel, tired of hiding, had
phoned him for help. Maturino then contacted Carter. The ranger cut
short a fishing trip in the Gulf of Mexico and headed to
Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really didn't know where Angel was, or whether he would
actually turn himself in,'' Robinson said. ``It was very important
to the family that Angel make the decision himself. They didn't
turn him in, but they encouraged him to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The pastor met Maturino at her home Sunday evening. Carter, an
FBI agent and a U.S. marshal arrived a short time later.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were several phone calls back and forth between Manuela
and Florentino on Sunday night and on Monday,'' Robinson said. ``By
10:30 Monday night, I went home and went to bed. My wife woke me up
at 12:30, saying I should get up and get dressed. I was going to El
Paso.''
</P>
<P>
   On the three-hour drive, Maturino slept off and on as the pastor
and the lawmen kept each other awake, speaking of everything but
the purpose of their overnight ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about how bright the stars were, and the marshal
said he had hoped to see the mountains, but it was still too
dark,'' Robinson said. ``It was Drew Carter's birthday, so we
talked about that. We talked about our families.''
</P>
<P>
   When they arrived in El Paso and checked into a motel, Robinson
slept for a few hours as Maturino made several more calls to her
brother in Mexico. By dawn, the group was on its way to the bridge,
still not sure what would happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one was really sure he was actually going to make it
across,'' Robinson said. ``Manuela was on the phone, and I did what
my job was: I went into a corner out of the way and I prayed.''
</P>
<P>
   From a building at the port of entry about 30 feet away,
Robinson watched as Florentino Maturino drove up with his
half-brother, who opened the passenger door and walked toward the
ranger about 10 a.m. Houston time. Carter offered the accused
killer his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He accepted it. There were a few words of conversation, and
then Angel turned and let Carter put the handcuffs on him,''
Robinson said. ``It was very calm, very peaceful. No one around
knew what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   As promised, the suspect's Mexican family _ two brothers and two
sisters _ crossed the border behind him. The lawmen stepped back so
they and Manuela Maturino could approach Maturino Resendez.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hugged him. They cried,'' Robinson said. ``He's accused
of some horrible things, but he's family. He's their brother.''

COUNTING THE KENNEDYS, COUNTING THE TRAGEDIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Should bear analysis slug)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has come to the point when Kennedy tragedy now seems to
overshadow Kennedy triumph, when the passage of time is marked not
by political conquests, but by soulful gatherings to grieve the
loss of another young son.
</P>
<P>
   With each death goes a little more of the glory, and those close
to the family said the feared loss of John Kennedy Jr., his young
wife and her sister is incomprehensibly sad. ``A devastating
blow,'' said William Manchester, a Kennedy friend, historian and
author of ``Death of a President.'' ``He embodied a lot of the
family qualities.'' Added Kennedy confidant Paul Kirk: ``It makes
your heart sick just to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some call it a curse, which seems an inadequate cliche at such
times. Others say that a family that persists in living on the edge
is being forced to suffer the consequences of its risky ways. They
fly their own single-engine planes when they can afford to hire
pilots. They ski without poles on the hardest hills of Aspen on the
last run of a December afternoon. They coax their way into the
military in hopes of facing combat. It is and always has been the
Kennedy way.
</P>
<P>
   ``John follows the family tradition that the man should live
this intrepid life,'' said Laurence Leamer, author of ``The Kennedy
Women,'' who is researching a book on the Kennedy men. ``He should
have been a coupon clipper, a wealthy guy going to his clubs. But
he wouldn't live that kind of life.''
</P>
<P>
   As a wedding celebration on the rolling lawn of the Hyannis Port
compound Saturday instead became an overnight, tear-choked vigil,
the legion of Kennedy friends and followers asked how much
misfortune this clan can take.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rose Kennedy used to say that the Lord never sends you a
burden too heavy to bear,'' said Frank Mankiewicz, a family adviser
for decades. ``I wonder now. It's getting close.''
</P>
<P>
   All Kennedy tragedies take their inevitable toll, but the feared
loss of John Kennedy somehow burns with a special poignancy. Aside
from his uncle, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, John Kennedy Jr. is the
best known of his family, the son of a late president, untarnished
by scandal, instilled with good sense by a mother _ Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis _ who sought to protect him from the prying media.
Devastatingly handsome and generally good-natured, he was voted the
sexiest man alive by People Magazine. His life, in short, has been
suffused with extraordinary vitality; he seems unimaginable in
death.
</P>
<P>
   His feared loss haunts in so many eerie ways. He disappeared on
the same weekend near the same island where 30 years before,
Senator Kennedy drove off a bridge on his way back from a
Chappaquiddick party. The elder Kennedy escaped, but his aide, Mary
Jo Kopechne, was later found dead in the submerged car. The
controversy over Kennedy's role and delayed call to authorities
derailed his presidential ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy Jr. would also be the third in his extended family
to die in a plane crash. On Aug. 12, 1944, Navy Lieutenant Joseph
P. Kennedy Jr., the eldest son of family matriarch and patriarch
Rose and Joseph, died when the bomber he was piloting exploded
during a mission meant to destroy rocket-launching sites in
Normandy, France. He was 29 years old.
</P>
<P>
   On May 13, 1948, Kathleen Kennedy, daughter of Rose and Joseph,
was killed when the chartered plane she was aboard crashed in the
Cevennes Mountains in southern France.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Kennedy narrowly survived a plane crash on June 19, 1964
outside of Springfield, where he was to appear at a Democratic
State Committee convention. He fractured his spine in six places; a
Kennedy aide and the plane's pilot were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The scroll of the Kennedy dead has grown mercilessly _ victims
of bullets, drugs, their own excesses and misfortunes. John Kennedy
was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963 in Dallas, his brother, Robert F.
Kennedy, on June 5, 1968 in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willpower, just willpower, and doing what's necessary is what
keeps me going,'' Rose Kennedy once said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Rose died in January 1995 at 104 years of age, she buried
a grandson, David Kennedy, RFK's son, who was found dead of a drug
overdose in a Palm Beach hotel in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, who has since served and retired
from Congress, was involved in a car crash that left a woman
paralyzed for life. His brother, Michael, stood accused of having
an affair with his children's teenaged baby sitter. He died in a
skiing accident on New Year's Eve 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Cousin William Kennedy Smith was accused of committing a rape at
the family's Palm Beach compound. After a highly celebrated trial,
he was acquitted in 1991 and has gone on to become a doctor. The
family estate has since been sold.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know the Kennedys say that in tragedy, they turn to
themselves and to prayer, and Saturday seemed no different as they
secluded themselves in their Cape Cod getaway with several priests
and a steady stream of visitors. A spokesman said they joined in
hearing Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life can be unfair,'' said Kirk, who has advised several
Kennedys. ``With this family, you have to say that sometimes it
asks too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their mantra was that everyone could make a difference and
each of us should try,'' Kirk added. ``But they fall much too
early, much too young. This is another promise dashed.''

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla _ He seemed normal.
</P>
<P>
   God knows, there was no reason he should be, born famous and
then ascending to legend by saluting his father's coffin on the day
he turned 3 years old.
</P>
<P>
   John Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr. combined the best of his father _
the charm, the smile, the ease with people _ with the best of his
mother: the bedrock sense of self, the chiseled, perfect looks that
had more than a touch of Black Jack Bouvier in them, and the
essential reserve that makes a man a mystery _ usually catnip to
women, and always, always to the media.
</P>
<P>
   He bore the burden of a horribly intrusive name, of expectations
that no one could live up to, with a shrug and a shy smile.
</P>
<P>
   There was always a sense of anticipation with JFK Jr. He carried
himself like a young prince, and we took him at that valuation.
Occasionally, he'd even play with those anticipations by stepping
gingerly into the public arena _ delivering a strong speech to the
Democratic convention in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   He was his mother's son in so many ways, for he had her way of
getting on and leading his life.
</P>
<P>
   After her marriage to Aristotle Onassis, Jackie set herself and
her children up in New York and stayed there for the rest of her
life. She stressed responsibility and impeccable manners; she
picked her children up from school every day, and her example took
hold.
</P>
<P>
   She trained Caroline and John Jr. to face real life and the real
world. Once, when John Jr. was mugged in Central Park, his mother
told bodyguards she thought it would be good for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really able to lead a normal life from about the age of
5,'' he said in 1997. Asked whether his mother had taught him about
handling fame, John Jr. said: ``We didn't actually sit down and
have a tutorial session. But you pick things up.''
</P>
<P>
   Through John Jr.'s days at college and law school and a
start-and-stop career as a lawyer, the media cheapened themselves,
but they never cheapened him; his aloofness shamed the jokers who
tailed him.
</P>
<P>
   That aloofness was not a pose. He was friendly with his cousins,
but also competitive with them, about doing worthwhile and
interesting things. His (gratuitous) reference to his late cousin
Michael's sexual goings-on in the pages of George was at least as
much about Michael's failure to justify his privileged life as it
was about sex.
</P>
<P>
   He chose to be representative of the best aspects of his family,
not the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day, his mother realized that she was going to use all the
publicity,'' says Laurence Leamer, author of The Kennedy Women and
a forthcoming volume on the Kennedy Men. ``The auction of her
effects was her joke; all those years she'd been exploited, and
this was her chance to exploit. And her son knew that.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if he was going to be named The Sexiest Man Alive by People
magazine and be dogged every time he set foot outside his house, he
had to figure out a way to use it to his own advantage. And he
finally figured it out: George.''
</P>
<P>
   It was politics, yes, but John Jr. could be part of the game
while at the same time being above the game. Anybody else with his
background wanting to start a magazine requiring millions of
dollars would have been shown the door. But because of who he was,
John Jr. got his money and his magazine.
</P>
<P>
   That he was so incredibly normal came to be the most abnormal
thing about him. He shopped at thrift shops in Palm Beach as well
as tony stores along Fifth Avenue. When he flunked the New York bar
for the second time, he told reporters, ``Clearly, I'm not a major
legal genius.'' He took the subway to work.
</P>
<P>
   He may have been born into the closest thing America has ever
had to a Royal Family, but he had the lucky gift of having no
illusions. His friends weren't politicians _ friendship is a luxury
for such creatures of expedience _ and they didn't talk to the
media.
</P>
<P>
   John Jr. had moved smoothly through his first act, had
established the premise for the second act. But now the play _ and
the audience _ is left without the third act we'd been expecting.
</P>
<P>
   There was a saying among the early 20th-century aristocracy, a
means of explaining their often-compulsive philanthropies: To those
whom much is given, much is expected. It was a mantra for the
Kennedys, encompassing their public crusades and private ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an unspoken codicil to that mantra, and surveying
the vast amount of destroyed and damaged lives that litter the
family history, beginning with Joseph Kennedy Jr. and extending
through sisters Kathleen and Rosemary, brothers John and Robert,
Robert's sons, and now John F. Kennedy Jr., it needs to be read
slightly differently: To those whom much is given, much is
expected, and much is demanded.
</P>
<P>
   Too much.

COMMANDING PRESENCE: STELLAR ACHIEVEMENTS LAND COLLINS LEADING

<TEXT>
<P>
   If it was only a matter of time before a woman assumed command
of an American space mission, then it was likely a foregone
conclusion that the job would go to astronaut Eileen Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by a lifelong love of flying, the 42-year-old Air Force
colonel and test pilot spent the last 20 years overcoming a series
of obstacles and professional challenges to position herself for a
spot in aviation history.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, on the eve of the 30th anniversary of man's first walk
on the moon, Collins will scramble aboard the space shuttle
Columbia to set a milestone of her own and prepare her crew to
blast off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida with NASA's
Chandra X-ray Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Russian cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova's
71-hour solo voyage in a small Vostok capsule in 1963, no woman has
ever claimed dominion over a spacecraft. None has ever assumed
command responsibility for the safety of an entire crew of space
travelers, nor for the success of a mission as complex as
Columbia's.
</P>
<P>
   Collins' crew will deploy the $1.55 billion Chandra X-ray
Observatory, a large space telescope designed for the study of
stellar explosions, galactic collisions and black holes. Together
with its propulsion system, the Chandra observatory is the largest
payload ever delivered to space by a shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Also, as chief pilot, Collins is responsible for Columbia's
orbital maneuvers and, most importantly, for manually flying the
ship's final approach and landing. As on all missions, Columbia's
high velocity ascent and re-entry are flown by software commands
stored in the cockpit flight computers.
</P>
<P>
   Coming nearly four decades after the first Russian and American
spaceflights, the role of commander has, in Collins' estimation,
been denied women far too long _ particularly in a culture that has
for many years embraced women as U.S. Supreme Court justices, as
leading politicians, as heart surgeons, as college presidents and
as captains of industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it could have happened before,'' laments Collins, who
is careful to note that she is simply building on the
accomplishments of women who preceded her in the cockpit _ pilots
in World War II who flew transport, not combat, missions because of
their gender, and the scrappy candidates who vied unsuccessfully
two decades later to become Mercury astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come here because I wanted to be the first in any
position,'' insists Collins, a willowy combination of grace and
grit, molded more by her blue-collar upbringing in small town
Elmira, N.Y., than feminine stridency. ``But if it's happening now,
and I'm the one that will be flying as the first woman commander,
then I really consider it an honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it seems it was an inevitability for which both
NASA and Collins have prepared themselves ever since the young Air
Force officer applied to become an astronaut in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that potentially she would be the first woman to
command a space shuttle, and we had that in mind when she was
selected,'' said Steve Hawley, who at the time was deputy chief of
NASA's astronaut corps and a member of the agency's astronaut
selection committee. Ironically, Hawley will fly with Collins as
Columbia's flight engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Under public pressure to diversify its all-male, predominantly
military fighter pilot Apollo-era astronaut corps, the space agency
selected a half-dozen medical doctors, scientists and engineers as
the first American woman astronauts in 1978. But by 1989, it had
yet to select a woman with the credentials to pilot and perhaps
command a spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Collins blames the shortcoming on a now redundant military
policy that denied women the opportunities to fly high-performance
combat aircraft. It was an obstacle that Collins had to overcome,
and when she did, the young pilot proved too attractive an
astronaut candidate for NASA to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we look for when we interview applicants is
whether this person is someone we would like to represent NASA,
someone we want the world to think of when they think of the space
program,'' said Hawley. ``Another thing we look for is whether this
is somebody who is in it for what he or she can get out of it
personally, or just somebody who wants to contribute to the success
of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, she is not in this for herself. In all of these
things she impressed all of us. She ended up ranking very high, not
just among women applicants, but in terms of all the pilot
applicants.''
</P>
<P>
   With only modest fanfare, Collins arrived at the Johnson Space
Center to begin her astronaut training in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Like most astronauts, Collins developed a love for flying in her
youth and an interest in spaceflight as her education exposed her
to math and the sciences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew I wanted to fly,'' she said in a 1994 profile.
``I think it was something I was born with.''
</P>
<P>
   The infatuation was nurtured by visits to the National Soaring
Museum near her hometown. Her father, a surveyor, often took his
four children there to watch gliders ride the thermals.
</P>
<P>
   Pursuing her interest would prove difficult. Her parents, James
and Rose Marie Collins, separated and for a time, the Collinses
relied on public housing and food stamps to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   Higher education was something she would have to earn herself.
At 17, Collins had saved enough from a retail sales job to begin
private flying lessons. She studied math, first, at a New York
community college.
</P>
<P>
   At Syracuse University, she joined the Air Force Reserve
Officers' Training Corps and earned a degree in math, the
qualifications she needed to begin military pilot training.
</P>
<P>
   Trained by 1979, she was denied by the Air Force, along with its
other women pilots, the opportunity to fly combat jets. Collins was
forced to scrape together the high-performance aircraft hours that
would make her eligible to become a shuttle pilot. Because of
military restrictions on women flying fighters, she had to log her
high-performance hours by instructing other Air Force pilots in the
T-38, a nimble, two-engine jet trainer used by the military to
teach its aviators the basics of supersonic flight.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Collins moved to the much larger C-141, a four-engine,
military jet transport. Based in California, she attained the hours
to earn an aircraft command, and even flirt with combat as she led
a rescue flight to Grenada as part of Operation Urgent Fury in
1983.
</P>
<P>
   She enriched her education with graduate degrees from Stanford
University in operations research, and from Webster University in
space systems management. She also did a stint as a professor of
mathematics at the U.S. Air Force Academy.
</P>
<P>
   There would be one more stop on her way to NASA _ the Air Force
Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle commanders are selected from a larger pool of pilot
astronauts. Typically, pilot astronauts fly twice, and sometimes
three times, functioning essentially as co-pilots to a more
seasoned commander before they are eligible for promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Collins served her apprenticeship ably in 1995 as the first
woman shuttle pilot, repeating the experience in 1997. The
missions, to Russia's Mir space station, featured delicate orbital
rendezvous maneuvers, satellite retrieval operations as well as
spacewalks by other crew members.
</P>
<P>
   In between, Collins and her husband, Pat Youngs, a Delta Air
Lines pilot and former Air Force officer, had their first child,
Bridget, now 3.
</P>
<P>
   Collins credits a supportive husband and a talented nanny with
making it possible to juggle a demanding job with the needs of a
young family. She also credits Rhea Seddon, Kathy Thornton and
other women astronauts who interrupted their careers to have
children with making it possible for her to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eileen is just a tremendous person to work for,'' said Jeff
Ashby, the 45-year-old naval aviator who will serve as Collin's
co-pilot. ``She started from very humble beginnings and worked her
way up. For that I respect her tremendously. She's earned the title
of commander of the space shuttle. It's not been given to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins' command will bring something extra that not all of her
male counterparts have to contend with _ the public spotlight. She
was summoned to the White House in March 1998 so first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton could announce the promotion. NASA would normally
handle announcement of a commander with a brief press release.
</P>
<P>
   Collins joined the first lady and President Clinton again last
October at the Kennedy Space Center for the launch of the shuttle
carrying aging Mercury astronaut John Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   She accepts the added attention, without embracing it, hopeful
it will help to spare those who follow her. Waiting in the wings
are Navy Lt. Cdr. Susan Still Kilrain, 37, who has also flown twice
as the shuttle's co-pilot, and Air Force Lt. Col. Pam Melroy, 37,
who is slated to fly as co-pilot for the first time early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA is very serious about giving Americans opportunities to
fly in space,'' said Collins. ``But to become an astronaut, you
can't just walk into the job. You have to prepare yourself. You
have to study. You have to have the right technical background.''

THESE DODGERS MORE WOEFUL THAN '92 EDITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember back in 1992 when the Dodgers lost 99 games and you
didn't think it could get any worse?
</P>
<P>
   Well, 1992 was a golden age for the Dodgers compared to now.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Mike Piazza and Raul Mondesi were in the minor-league
pipeline ready to win back-to-back Rookie of the Year awards. So
were Ismael Valdes and Todd Hollandsworth.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they have no farm system. If they did, they wouldn't be
baseball's only team with three players making $9 million or more.
And it is a rare night when Kevin Brown, Gary Sheffield or Mondesi
look like they are worth the money.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers never won a playoff game with that bunch, but they
did win National League West titles in 1994 and '95. Given this
season and last, that doesn't seem so bad.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza lacked the leadership to move the Dodgers beyond the
first round, but since he was traded, the club hasn't even been
competitive. Sheffield and Brown are the leaders now. Two Saturdays
ago, they started a bonfire in the Dodger bullpen to purge demons
and still lost. Even though they have won six of seven, they are in
last place and no closer to first than they were July 1.
</P>
<P>
   If the season ended today, the Dodgers wouldn't even fare that
well in next June's amateur draft. In 1992, they picked second,
which was good enough for Darren Dreifort but sadly not good enough
to get Alex Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Management seems just as inept. It has money to spend, but
spending it on pitcher Carlos Perez and center fielder Devon White
has been a dreadful mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, GM Kevin Malone and President Bob Graziano went to
the Dominican Republic to hire Felipe Alou as their manager and
only helped him leverage a better contract out of the Montreal
Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Graziano thought he held all the power when playing an Arizona
Indian tribe against Vero Beach, Fla., for the club's future
spring-training home. The club hired a lobbyist to make sure the
state of Florida approved government dollars to improve Dodgertown.
It didn't work. Then the Indian tribe said it needed the Dodgers to
kick in some money. Instead of holding two states hostage as is
customary in these matters, the Dodgers wound up looking weak and
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Both cases must have come out of the new book, ``The Dodger Way
to Play Baseball _ the Lost Chapters.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Fox hired former NBA marketing whiz Rick Welts to
oversee the operation _ ahead of Graziano _ but they have made
plenty of mistakes of their own. They had the right to trade Piazza
but not on some Steinbrenner-esque whim by Chase Carey that has
brought nothing in return.
</P>
<P>
   Signing Brown was fine, but they were negotiating against
themselves when they added a seventh year, threw in six flights
home and a $100,000 bonus for making the All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   Vin Scully, whose broadcasts have become increasingly critical,
said on air a few weeks back, ``You'd think with all the millions
the players make, they'd pay the teams bonuses if they didn't make
the All-Star team. Just a thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Living through 1992 was not pleasant. Before the season, general
manager Fred Claire traded Tim Belcher and John Wetteland for Eric
Davis. Claire wanted to team Davis with childhood buddy Darryl
Strawberry and Brett Butler to form what he thought would be one of
the greatest Dodgers outfields of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry ruptured a disc in his back in May and was never the
same. Davis arrived hurt and continued to get injured. He needed
three operations, three teams and four years to turn his career
around.
</P>
<P>
   It also was during that summer that the Dodgers played a series
of doubleheaders against Montreal because of games lost to the
riots in South Central L.A. During those games, Delino DeShields
played so brilliantly for the Expos that Claire saw him as the heir
to Butler's spot at the time of the order.
</P>
<P>
   He traded an underachieving, oft-injured right-hander named
Pedro Martinez to get DeShields.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the season, there were rumors that manager Tom
Lasorda was headed to Tampa Bay to manage the Devil Rays before
turning the job over to Bobby Valentine and becoming GM. But unlike
the 1970s, when reports of Lasorda leaving was big news, no one
seemed to care this time.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought the worst was yet to come.

   (NYT20) BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- July 17, 1999 -- ALA-MAYOR-RETIRE,
7-17 -- After 20 years, Mayor Richard Arrington Jr. of Birmingham,
Ala., has resigned, having helped the city become placid and
prosperous. When Arrington took office in 1979 as the city's first
black mayor, Birmingham was still struggling to shed its national
reputation as ``Bombingham,'' the city where racial divisions
became explosive in the 1960s and where any police shooting
threatened to turn into a confrontation. (Alan S. Weiner/New York

third-, sixth- and eighth-graders are back in class for extra
reading and writing, and to a lesser extent mathematics, to prepare
them for the promotion test in early August. Mandatory summer
school is expected to grow much larger next year. (Librado

   HYANNIS PORT, Mass. _ The big white tent was still set on the
lawn between the Kennedy family compound here and Nantucket Sound,
for the planned wedding reception Saturday afternoon for Rory
Kennedy, the youngest of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's
children.
</P>
<P>
   But there were no Kennedys in sight, and the wedding was
postponed. The hazy summer day lengthened, and joy turned into
sorrow once again for the Kennedy clan, as word came that a small
plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy, and her sister, Lauren Bessette, had apparently crashed
into the ocean on Friday night while approaching nearby Martha's
Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   As has happened so often in the past _ when President John F.
Kennedy was assassinated, when Senator Robert F. Kennedy was shot,
when Rory Kennedy's older brother, Michael, was killed last year in
a skiing accident _ the roads around the Kennedy compound were
closed by the police, leaving the family secluded inside and a
throng of reporters and camera crews outside.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the accident spread slowly in nearby Hyannis Saturday
morning, so that some of the 275 guests for the wedding came to the
John F. Kennedy Museum on Main Street unaware of what had happened.
They were viewing old photographs of a young John Jr. greeting his
father on an airport tarmac in 1963 when a museum official had to
tell them what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were preparing to go to the wedding, some of them from
Ireland, and they were totally shocked when we told them what
happened,'' said Pearl Guba, the museum manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing that John's mother, Jackie, died first, she
was so fond of her son,'' Ms. Guba said.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Pierce, the chairwoman of the museum, said that as the
day went on other people began arriving at the museum as a way to
commemorate John F. Kennedy Jr. ``We've seen that too many times
when people are drawn here when there is a Kennedy tragedy,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors at the Kennedy compound, a cluster of white clapboard
cottages with green shutters set near the beach, said all of Sen.
Robert Kennedy's surviving children were inside the house of their
mother, Ethel, on Saturday: Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the
lieutenant governor of Maryland; Joseph P. Kennedy III, the former
Massachusetts congressman; Robert F. Kennedy Jr.; Courtney Kennedy;
Kerry Kennedy; Christopher Kennedy; Max Kennedy and Douglas
Kennedy; along with Rory Kennedy, a film maker, who was scheduled
to be married to Mark Bailey, a fellow film maker.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy Jr.'s sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, was
not here, neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   A Kennedy family spokesman described the family's mood as
``somber'' Saturday afternoon. ``There are a lot of children
running around,'' the spokesman, Brian O'Connor, said. ``That tends
to lighten the mood, but obviously there is a great deal of concern
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The family has gathered at the compound to mourn almost as often
as to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   Two of John F. Kennedy Jr.,'s cousins, David and Michael, both
sons of Robert Kennedy, died young, the latter of a drug overdose
in 1984, as did four Kennedys of the preceding generation. Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, 67, the youngest of the nine children of Joseph
P. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, is the only familiar Kennedy face
to survive middle age.
</P>
<P>
   The nation and the world were shocked when President Kennedy was
murdered by Lee Harvey Oswald on Nov. 22, 1963.
</P>
<P>
   The nation was jolted again on June 6, 1968, when Robert Kennedy
was shot, just after claiming victory in the California
presidential primary in a year roiled by the war in Vietnam and
urban turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   But misfortune ran in the family long before then.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph P. Kennedy, Roosevelt's ambassador to Great Britain
before World War II, had envisioned his eldest son, Joe Jr., as the
nation's first Catholic president after his own hopes had faded.
Joe, a Navy pilot stationed in Great Britain in 1944, was killed on
a secret mission.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Kennedy, the fourth Kennedy child, was flying from
Paris to Cannes with her fiance, Lord Peter Fitzwilliam, when their
De Havilland crashed in severe weather, killing them both, on May
13, 1948.
</P>
<P>
   While Joseph Kennedy savored his son Jack's inauguration and the
first few months of the presidency, he suffered a debilitating
stroke in 1961. He lived until 1969. The family's matriarch, Rose,
died on Jan. 22, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   After the assassinations, came the disaster known simply as
Chappaquiddick, on the night of July 18, 1969, 30 years ago this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Kennedy flew to Martha's Vineyard to sail his brother
Jack's boat in a regatta and to attend a party with several young
women who had been Robert's campaign aides. He left with one of
them, Mary Jo Kopechne. He testified later that he had been tired
and she was feeling ill and he was returning to their motels when
he drove off a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island and she drowned. The
episode shadowed his political career, although he remains a
leading Democratic senator.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Kennedy, talking with a reporter in Washington on Friday,
had been looking forward to Rory's wedding. He recalled that a year
ago he had brought all the family's generations together on Cape
Cod for an event that was neither a wedding nor a funeral but a
reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 105 Kennedys,'' Senator Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy Jr. observed in 1995 on ``Larry King Live'' that
he did not fear for his life. ``It's sort of like walking around
wondering if you are going to be struck by lightning. It's not
something you really keep in the forefront of your mind.''

COUPLE OFTEN SPOTTED IN THEIR LOWER MANHATTAN NEIGHBORHOOD

   NEW YORK _ Outside John F. Kennedy Jr.'s nine-story loft
building in Tribeca, a fashionable neighborhood in Lower Manhattan,
one bouquet of flowers lay near the glass front door, and a large
media contingent had gathered across the street. But the crowds
were tiny, contrasting sharply with the enormous gatherings outside
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis's posh Fifth Avenue apartment after her
death five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was a different sort of New Yorker than his mother, who
guarded her privacy tenaciously and lived the gilded,
doorman-attended life of the Upper East Side elite. Despite his
celebrity, Kennedy was often seen rollerblading through Central
Park or jogging along the Hudson River near his apartment. He lived
in an up-and-coming neighborhood of the very rich, but many of the
buildings are covered with graffiti, and refurbished buildings like
Kennedy's often sit between dilapidated structures and gutted
warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said Kennedy and his wife, Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy,
could walk around the neighborhood without being bothered. They
often hung out at Walker's, a microbrewery, and Bubby's, a nearby
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to see him walking down the street, but this isn't the
kind of place where people would give him trouble,'' said John
Cristovich, a clerk at an upscale antiques shop across the street
from Kennedy's red-brick building. ``It's all big money.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate Beattie, who works at J. Mably Fabric Co., also on
Kennedy's street, said the couple were simply part of the
neighborhood, and the news that their plane had crashed en route to
Martha's Vineyard left her sad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just devastating that a family could have so much tragedy
in it,'' she said. ``I mean, how much can one family endure? I
don't want to believe that they're dead. It's so surreal.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Baetz, her co-worker, added: ``It's sad, because
they were really a new couple. They didn't really have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon, the top editors of George, the magazine
founded by Kennedy, gathered in the slick monthly's midtown offices
on Broadway. An operator said Kennedy's colleagues were not
available for comment.

EUROPE GRIPPED BY LATEST TRAGEDY IN AMERICA'S ROYAL FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>

   LONDON _ The Southwood beauty salon in North London was full
Saturday, as it is on most Saturday afternoons. But Saturday was
different, because at the top of each hour, the stylists paused,
holding their scissors aloft, the assistants at the sinks turned
off the water, and those getting their hair done craned their necks
to hear the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``A light aircraft carrying the son of the assassinated
president John F. Kennedy has been reported missing,'' a BBC
announcer intoned.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the chairs, Maggie Smith's mouth fell open and she
covered it with a cupped hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God,'' she said, almost in a whisper, ``that family is
cursed.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's reaction, delivered as dye soaked into her hair,
captured international reaction to the news that John F. Kennedy
Jr.'s plane was missing.
</P>
<P>
   How, people all over the world asked, could so many bad things
happen to one family? It is a question that will be asked over and
over again because, in Europe especially, this is the only story
that will matter in the coming days and weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturdays, the Southwood salon is usually a cacophony of
conversation, as the stylists and their customers trade gossip.
Saturday, it was somber and subdued and people spoke about the
missing plane in hushed tones.
</P>
<P>
   For Jean Draper, a hairstylist at Southwood, the news was
crushing. A native of Ireland, Draper said the Kennedys occupy a
special place in the land of their forebears.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard the news I was shocked,'' said Draper.
``But the more I thought about it, it's gotten to the point where
nothing surprises me about the Kennedys. They have tragedy after
tragedy, and it never seems to end. I don't know how they handle
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Alderson, a native of Scotland, shook his head as he
contemplated the news. The British royal family has had its share
of failed marriages, and this country came to a standstill after
Diana, Princess of Wales died in a car crash in Paris two years
ago. But compared with the Kennedys, the Windsors have been
remarkably free of lethal tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it about that family?'' Alderson asked. ``Every time
this happens, I ask myself the same question. What is it about that
family?''
</P>
<P>
   The story topped French TV news, and Italian state TV also led
with the story, using the 1963 photo of ``John-John'' saluting his
father's coffin. Israel and Russia also played the story
prominently.
</P>
<P>
   For the tabloid press, especially in Britain, the story is
manna. This is what Europeans call the silly season, when the
absence of real news, most of it politically driven, leads
newspapers to drum up stories to fill a void that runs from
mid-July until September.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the British tabloids are right-wing and relish
rubbishing the Kennedys. The word ``curse'' was being fit Saturday
night into many tabloid headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Rupert Murdoch's Sky News network devoted most of its coverage
Saturday to the search for the Kennedy plane. A strip across the
bottom of the screen reminded viewers of the ``Kennedy Curse'' and
of how US Senator Edward M. Kennedy was charged with drunken
driving after Mary Jo Kopechne died three decades ago in a car he
was driving on Martha's Vineyard, the destination of the missing
Kennedy plane.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1980s, when Ted Kennedy forced Murdoch to comply
with a Federal Communications Commission edict forbidding the
ownership of newspapers and television stations in the same area,
Murdoch papers have taken aim at the Kennedy family.
</P>
<P>
   But while the tabloids have begun a feeding frenzy, the story
leads the BBC news bulletins, and it will dominate serious news
coverage for days if not weeks to come.
</P>
<P>
   As Draper sees it, that will be unsurprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the American royal family, aren't they?'' she asked.

WEDDING FESTIVITIES TURN TO GRIM VIGIL IN HYANNIS PORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE AND CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HYANNIS PORT, Mass. _ The clan has always come to their
sprawling and storied compound here to celebrate or to mourn what
matriarch Rose Kennedy once described as the agony and the ecstasy
of her family's so public life.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, it was a particularly poignant clash of those two
extremes.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of family members had gathered in the intense sunshine of
a midsummer weekend to celebrate the wedding of Robert F. Kennedy's
youngest daughter, Rory. But soon, the festivities turned into a
vigil, with the family praying they would not have to hold yet
another funeral.
</P>
<P>
   The waiting began in the earliest hours of the morning, just
hours after guests had gone to bed following the rehearsal dinner,
with a phone call alerting Senator Ted Kennedy that his nephew's
plane had disappeared. At dawn, a friend visiting the compound
described the mood as ``very worried, very somber.''
</P>
<P>
   By midmorning, with an American flag and several abandoned white
wedding tents flapping in a strong offshore breeze, the family
gathered for an impromptu mass on Ethel Kennedy's porch, praying
for the missing and for the bride and groom.
</P>
<P>
   There, offering solace, were the same three priests who only 19
months ago presided at Michael Kennedy's funeral _ one who said the
last rites for Rose Kennedy, another, the officiant at RFK's
funeral, the third, the priest who married the missing, John F.
Kennedy Jr. and his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   At the gates of the compound, gawkers arrived in the early
morning to catch a glimpse of the white dress or celebrity guests,
only to be told that the wedding had been postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1 p.m., Sen. Kennedy phoned a close friend and said the
family was holding out ``hope upon hope that a miracle might
happen.'' But, the friend said, Kennedy's voice sounded tired and
flat.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, who had planned to go to Martha's Vineyard for an
early afternoon fundraiser, paced the lawn amid tiny fourth
generation Kennedys. JFK Jr's cousin, former US Rep. Joseph P.
Kennedy II, sat on the porch talking to friends, and all day long,
pairs of cousins and siblings took to the beach, as they had the
winter morning of Michael's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   The 275 wedding guests had been called in early morning and told
that the wedding was postponed indefinitely. But out of confusion,
stunned grief _ or perhaps simply because they had other things on
their mind _ family members had forgotten to call off the caterers,
who arrived at 3 p.m. with two trucks of food for a 6 p.m. wedding.
Soon flowers, too, began arriving, but it was unclear whether they
were in grief or in anticipation of the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, as the family waited for some word, the scene
came to resemble happier gatherings here, as the bride and her
husband-to-be, Mark Bailey, came out with about 20 family members
to fly kites on the immense lawn, site of so many photographed
family football games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of children running around, which always seems
to change the atmosphere,'' said Brian O'Connor, spokesman for the
former Congressman. ``People are happy to see one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Would-be wedding guests who came by in the early morning hours
left quietly in the afternoon as family members began to gather.
William Kennedy Smith, JFK's cousin, arrived at Logan Airport.
Caroline Kennedy, John's older sister, was on a rafting vacation in
the West, and had not been planning to attend the wedding.
President Clinton had reportedly telephoned her to offer her
assistance in flying back east.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a town where locals have refused to gape at the frequent
Kennedy sightings over the years, people couldn't help but comment
how the family seemed to have such a run of bad luck, or as most
called it Saturday, a curse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to use that phrase....but it just falls all
around them,'' said Jane Tyson, sitting at Four Seas Ice Cream,
which is still known as the place where Jackie Kennedy used to
borrow a few dollars from Secret Service agents to buy cones for
Caroline and John-John. ``This should have been a very happy day.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, on bicycles, one girl explained to her younger friend
that there wouldn't be any wedding. ``He's dead,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The wedding guests were to gather for Rory, who seemed
especially due for a happy occasion _ and marked by tragedy. Her
mother was pregnant with her when Robert F. Kennedy was killed in
Los Angeles in 1968. It was Rory who cradled her big brother
Michael's head as he lay dying on a Colorado ski slope on New
Year's Eve, 1997, begging him to ``Just hang on for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the family could use some hope,'' said Melissa
Lewandowski, tying yellow ribbons on telephone poles alongside the
white picket fences of the compound. ``If they saw a yellow ribbon,
they'd know the community is hoping with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps typical for a family frequently called America's
royalty, even the tragedy was a combination of celebrity watching
and sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on Martha's Vineyard Saturday looking for John-John,''
said Francine Wiener, 51, who was vacationing in Yarmouth. ``Ever
since he did that salute, the first time at his father's funeral,
I've been following him. I don't want my search for John-John to
end this way. I hope for the best, but I don't think that's going
to be the case.''

COUNTING THE KENNEDYS, COUNTING THE TRAGEDIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has come to the point when Kennedy tragedy now seems to
overshadow Kennedy triumph, when the passage of time is marked not
by political conquests, but by soulful gatherings to grieve the
loss of another young son.
</P>
<P>
   With each death goes a little more of the glory, and those close
to the family said the feared loss of John Kennedy Jr., his young
wife and her sister is incomprehensibly sad. ``A devastating
blow,'' said William Manchester, a Kennedy friend, historian and
author of ``Death of a President.'' ``He embodied a lot of the
family qualities.'' Added Kennedy confidant Paul Kirk: ``It makes
your heart sick just to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some call it a curse, which seems an inadequate cliche at such
times. Others say that a family that persists in living on the edge
is being forced to suffer the consequences of its risky ways. They
fly their own single-engine planes when they can afford to hire
pilots. They ski without poles on the hardest hills of Aspen on the
last run of a December afternoon. They coax their way into the
military in hopes of facing combat. It is and always has been the
Kennedy way.
</P>
<P>
   ``John follows the family tradition that the man should live
this intrepid life,'' said Laurence Leamer, author of ``The Kennedy
Women,'' who is researching a book on the Kennedy men. ``He should
have been a coupon clipper, a wealthy guy going to his clubs. But
he wouldn't live that kind of life.''
</P>
<P>
   As a wedding celebration on the rolling lawn of the Hyannis Port
compound Saturday instead became an overnight, tear-choked vigil,
the legion of Kennedy friends and followers asked how much
misfortune this clan can take.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rose Kennedy used to say that the Lord never sends you a
burden too heavy to bear,'' said Frank Mankiewicz, a family adviser
for decades. ``I wonder now. It's getting close.''
</P>
<P>
   All Kennedy tragedies take their inevitable toll, but the feared
loss of John Kennedy somehow burns with a special poignancy. Aside
from his uncle, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, John Kennedy Jr. is the
best known of his family, the son of a late president, untarnished
by scandal, instilled with good sense by a mother _ Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis _ who sought to protect him from the prying media.
Devastatingly handsome and generally good-natured, he was voted the
sexiest man alive by People Magazine. His life, in short, has been
suffused with extraordinary vitality; he seems unimaginable in
death.
</P>
<P>
   His feared loss haunts in so many eerie ways. He disappeared on
the same weekend near the same island where 30 years before,
Senator Kennedy drove off a bridge on his way back from a
Chappaquiddick party. The elder Kennedy escaped, but his aide, Mary
Jo Kopechne, was later found dead in the submerged car. The
controversy over Kennedy's role and delayed call to authorities
derailed his presidential ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy Jr. would also be the third in his extended family
to die in a plane crash. On Aug. 12, 1944, Navy Lieutenant Joseph
P. Kennedy Jr., the eldest son of family matriarch and patriarch
Rose and Joseph, died when the bomber he was piloting exploded
during a mission meant to destroy rocket-launching sites in
Normandy, France. He was 29 years old.
</P>
<P>
   On May 13, 1948, Kathleen Kennedy, daughter of Rose and Joseph,
was killed when the chartered plane she was aboard crashed in the
Cevennes Mountains in southern France.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Kennedy narrowly survived a plane crash on June 19, 1964
outside of Springfield, where he was to appear at a Democratic
State Committee convention. He fractured his spine in six places; a
Kennedy aide and the plane's pilot were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The scroll of the Kennedy dead has grown mercilessly _ victims
of bullets, drugs, their own excesses and misfortunes. John Kennedy
was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963 in Dallas, his brother, Robert F.
Kennedy, on June 5, 1968 in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willpower, just willpower, and doing what's necessary is what
keeps me going,'' Rose Kennedy once said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Rose died in January 1995 at 104 years of age, she buried
a grandson, David Kennedy, RFK's son, who was found dead of a drug
overdose in a Palm Beach hotel in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, who has since served and retired
from Congress, was involved in a car crash that left a woman
paralyzed for life. His brother, Michael, stood accused of having
an affair with his children's teenaged baby sitter. He died in a
skiing accident on New Year's Eve 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Cousin William Kennedy Smith was accused of committing a rape at
the family's Palm Beach compound. After a highly celebrated trial,
he was acquitted in 1991 and has gone on to become a doctor. The
family estate has since been sold.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know the Kennedys say that in tragedy, they turn to
themselves and to prayer, and Saturday seemed no different as they
secluded themselves in their Cape Cod getaway with several priests
and a steady stream of visitors. A spokesman said they joined in
hearing Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life can be unfair,'' said Kirk, who has advised several
Kennedys. ``With this family, you have to say that sometimes it
asks too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their mantra was that everyone could make a difference and
each of us should try,'' Kirk added. ``But they fall much too
early, much too young. This is another promise dashed.''

WEST BANK EXCAVATION MAY REVEAL RELICS FROM ABRAHAM'S TIME 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEBRON, West Bank _ Archaeologists on a ``rescue dig'' believe
they have discovered the remains of structures dated to about the
time that biblical scholars say the patriarch Abraham was here.
</P>
<P>
   Jagged stone walls, some as high as 20 feet, and a maze of
primitive rooms and ramparts were uncovered during a routine
excavation to prepare for permanent housing for Israeli settlers
claiming the site.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli law requires what it calls ``rescue digs'' before
construction to prevent the accidental destruction of any precious
finds that may be hidden underground.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists said the artifacts reveal the city was inhabited
almost without interruption for nearly 3,000 years _ from the early
Bronze Age, or about 2500 B.C., to the early part of the Byzantine
Empire, roughly A.D. 500.
</P>
<P>
   The outer wall of the city dates to 1600 B.C., corresponding to
the time biblical experts calculate Abraham went to Hebron to buy
land for a burial place for his wife, Sarah. The excavation is less
than a mile from the site where both Jews and Muslims believe that
Sarah, Abraham and other biblical figures are buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biblical city, the ancient site of Hebron,'' said
the lead archaeologist, Emanuel Eisenberg of the Israel Antiquities
Authority, which is sponsoring the rescue dig.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this,'' he said, pointing to the outer city wall, ``is
more or less the wall that Abraham could have seen when he dealt
with the ruler of this place to buy the burial ground for his
family, where the Tomb of the Patriarchs is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists began digging last May _ ahead of plans by seven
Jewish families to build there _ because they suspected the site,
called Tel Rumeida, was built on top of ancient Hebron. The
settlers have been living in temporary housing in the area,
squeezed between Palestinians and military posts.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the settlers' mobile homes were hoisted on top of other
mobile homes to make way for the dig. The excavation slowly
uncovered exactly what the archaeologists suspected might be there
_ extraordinarily well-preserved fortification walls of an ancient
city with alleyways and the remains of small stone houses.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenberg said the oldest part of the excavation has been dated
to the time the Egyptians built the pyramids, or about 2500 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   The city's builders managed to drag huge stone blocks, some
weighing as much as 2 tons, to make thick walls, using only
primitive tools. Archaeologists found tools and weapons made out of
bronze and bone on site.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists dated another section of the ancient city to
about 1000 B.C., the time of the reign of King David, though no
evidence has yet been found to link this first Israelite king to
the site. According to the Bible, Hebron was King David's seat of
power before he moved the capital to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   But Eisenberg said he is holding out hope.``What we have here is
(the site of) the ancestors and descendents of his dynasty,'' said
Eisenberg. ``But we still hope to find something that could
identify him with the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Pottery shards and other finds show that this part of the city
was continuously inhabited until as late as 700 B.C., when King
Hezekiah ruled the ancient kingdom of Judah. Evidence also shows
that during this period the city was ravaged by fire.
</P>
<P>
   Charred rock and broken pottery still sit where the fire once
raged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nicely preserved,'' said Eisenberg. ``This in our eyes is
a beautiful picture of a destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, though the Bible doesn't mention that Hebron was ever
destroyed, Eisenberg said evidence shows that for some reason
people stopped living here for nearly 500 years, until roughly 200
B.C.
</P>
<P>
   When people returned to the city, they used some of the old
stones to make new structures and left other buildings intact,
including a public grain silo from the time of the Israelite kings.
</P>
<P>
   In roughly A.D. 500, during the Byzantine Empire, the
inhabitants were making wine.
</P>
<P>
   The archaeologists uncovered what Eisenberg called a ``very
developed'' wine press made from stone and wood. And by this
period, much of the ancient city had been covered with dirt and
used to grow olives and grapes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Israeli settlers moved mobile homes to the area, which
by then had become nothing more than an empty lot of dirt and weeds
tucked between sandstone houses belonging to Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   With the Bible as their guide, settlers say they moved mobile
homes here because they believed it was the site of ancient Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after a settler was killed by Palestinians,
then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised other settlers
permanent housing. It is not known yet whether Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's government will honor that pledge.
</P>
<P>
   With the discovery, construction of permanent housing for the
settlers has been put on hold. They say the find has strengthened
their conviction to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our heritage sitting right in front of our eyes, the
beginnings of Judaism and monotheism,'' said David Wilder, a
spokesman for the Hebron settlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping that Barak will honor the agreement made by
Netanyahu to let us build,'' he said. ``What we'd like to do is
build above the area, so that people can see the finds below, but
we can still live in houses above.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisenberg said he hopes to see the ancient city protected, but
that the decision was not in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, the finds are important and worth
preservation,'' he said. ``But it's a political issue, and it's
very sensitive.''

CSUN'S BRADLEY FIGHTS FOR FOOTBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The realist in me says Cal State Northridge
administrators just destroyed their football team.
</P>
<P>
   The bright young man in front of me says not so fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still the team that everybody said has so much
potential,'' says Jaumal Bradley, the senior fullback and team
captain, with confidence and determination in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   He's standing outside Ron and Lisa Ponciano's house on a sunny
side street in Northridge, a house with a pickup and camper shell
in the driveway and a ``Love Lives Here'' sign in the kitchen. It's
a few hours after CSUN fired Ponciano on Friday, pronouncing the
second-year head coach guilty of recruiting violations that he
denies.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has come to stand up for Ponciano, who is holding a
press conference to state as much of his side of the story as he
can with a lawsuit looming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came down here to give him a handshake and a hug,'' Bradley
says.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley loves Ponciano, believes his forceful denials, thinks
the firing is the real crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a father figure to me,'' he says. ``This is more than
a football coach. This is a relative, a family member.''
</P>
<P>
   But something Ponciano tells the reporters rubs Bradley the
wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   The coach alludes to ``the general consensus'' that the latest
controversy will be the death of the sport on the San Fernando
Valley campus, and says the 1999 season could be ``a death march''
for the embittered players.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt some of Bradley's young teammates will agree and will
utter rash vows to transfer away.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley says he'll try to talk them out of it.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a dinner this weekend with Marcus Brady, the
sophomore quarterback who is the Big Sky Conference's rising star
and could cripple the team by leaving. There will be a players'
meeting Tuesday. At each, Bradley plans to sound a defiant message.
</P>
<P>
   He'll remind them how Ponciano taught the team to keep fighting,
that one reason the coach refused to resign his job is that he
wouldn't defy his own message.
</P>
<P>
   He'll remind them of the times they'd played angry and won, the
times they'd fought through distractions, the times the players'
spirit was all that held the red and black together.
</P>
<P>
   He'll remind them of last year's CSUN women's basketball team,
which lost its head coach to a drug-trafficking bust, yet earned
the university's first conference title and trip to the NCAA
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some people, adversity is a reason to quit,'' he says.
``For some, it's a reason to fight harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to go out,'' he promises, ``and prove this team is
worthy of the support of the school and the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is a tough-looking 25-year-old with a tattoo on his left
biceps and a little silver football on a chain around his neck.
He's one of the few married men on the team.
</P>
<P>
   He's in college at 25 because he lost a few years to juvenile
misbehavior. He doesn't have time to skip a season and start fresh
at another school.
</P>
<P>
   Brady is one teammate who would have time. The quarterback who
passed for more than 2,000 yards in his freshman season was said to
be upset by Ponciano's firing, so emotional that friends urged him
to collect himself before submitting to interviews on the topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marcus is 18, 19. A young man might say something he
regrets,'' Bradley says. ``I'm going to tell him, `Think about
this. This is your career, this is your education, your livelihood,
your future.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley believes Brady will listen to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to hear from me, from other (seniors) on the team,
that we're going to take charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds as if Bradley just did.
</P>
<P>
   What happens next will depend on whether the administration
appoints the right assistant coach to Ponciano's job, keeping key
players happy, or goes with the wrong assistant or an outsider,
driving them away.
</P>
<P>
   What happens in the end will depend on whether the players take
the firing as a cue to abandon the funny little football program
with the box of splinters for a stadium, or dedicate themselves to
making this promising season a success in Ponciano's honor.
</P>
<P>
   If the young Matadors make the latest crisis a rallying cry,
they'll have given us a reason at long last to root for CSUN
football.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling sorry for themselves won't help.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley refuses to let his team feel sorry for itself.
</P>
<P>
   He's saving his pity for the team that will have to feel the
Matadors' anger in their Sept. 4 season opener in Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pity Western Oregon,'' Bradley says with the slightest hint
of a smile.

 LEDE--2ND   TAKE-ART-BOS  
 BOSTON: ... to the day.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For nearly 10 hours, the search focused on a nearly
1,000-square-mile area between the two airports, though much of it
was focused around Montauk, Coast Guard officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether a rescue effort might have been more effective if
begun sooner, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Steve Roark said: ``I
don't think so, because it was nighttime, and because of our
standard search procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how long the search would continue, Coast Guard commander
Mike Lapinski said: ``A lot of things come into play. The Coast
Guard is searching for survivors, and any indications there might
have been a chance of getting out and surviving and potentially
being in the water would lead them to continue. The more signs
there are, the longer we search.''
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Rear Admiral Richard Larrabee said Kennedy's
celebrity status had no bearing on the intensity of the search.
``Our efforts are consistent with the way we would search for
anyone who was lost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 1 p.m., the search shifted almost exclusively to
the waters off Martha's Vineyard when beachgoers found items linked
to Kennedy's plane.
</P>
<P>
   Erin McCarthy, 31, of Boston, was sitting on the beach with her
friends when she spotted something in the water. Thinking it might
be debris from the crash, her friend Damon Seligson, 30, a Boston
lawyer, swam out to get it.
</P>
<P>
   It was a black canvas bag packed with clothes, a bathing suit,
cosmetics, and a hair dryer. The bag had an ID tag with Lauren
Bessette's business cards from Morgan Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible sinking feeling,'' said Seligson. ``I felt
my heart burst out of my chest. It was just terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Campbell, 34, a private pilot from Greenwich, Conn., said
he saw the nose wheel and a part called a ``wheel pant'' from a
single-engine plane washed up on the beach. A short time later,
searchers turned up a headrest and part of a plane support called a
strut, said Coast Guard Lieutenant Craig Jaramillo.
</P>
<P>
   The plane Kennedy was flying was built in June 1995. He
purchased it used from Minir Hussain, a 39-year-old native of
Pakistan who runs a furniture factory in New Jersey. Hussain sold
it through a broker and said he believed Kennedy paid about
$300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hussain said he was at the Essex County Airport on Friday night
and noticed the plane was out of its hangar. He said he immediately
became worried when he was told Kennedy was going to be flying on
his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a risky situation for him to be flying without an
instructor because he was not instrument-rated to fly on his own,''
Hussain said in a telephone interview. ``I know that John was a
very good pilot. Everyone knew that. But I immediately began to
worry because the conditions were not that good.''
</P>
<P>
   Hussain said he had just landed his own plane at the airport and
believed that the visibility was not ideal, around 6 miles. While
it was still clear enough to take off without instruments, he felt
that it was ``too risky'' for someone without instrument
certification to do so.
</P>
<P>
   An FAA source said Kennedy had completed just 46 hours of flight
time.
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking federal transportation offical said the National
Transportation Safety Board had pulled the maintenance records of
the plane and found it to be well cared for.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently Kennedy did not fill his tanks prior to departure,
but fuel records obtained by the safety board indicate there were
at least 90 gallons on board, plenty of fuel for a single-engine
plane to make that trip. However, the plane has two fuel tanks, one
in each wing, and a pilot must remember to switch from one to the
other before fuel runs out.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the proximity of the wreckage to Jacqueline Onassis'
former Vineyard home, the official speculated that Kennedy may have
been ``buzzing'' the property that he and his sister now own and
was caught in a thermal updraft by the Gay Head cliffs.
</P>
<P>
   A thermal updraft would cause the plane to rise suddenly, and
the normal response of the pilot would be to push the yoke down to
lower the nose. Once the plane cleared the updraft, the plane could
suddenly dive. At low altitudes, such a move could be catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't count the number of times I have seen low-time pilots,
with family or friends on board, showing off by buzzing their house
and get into trouble,'' the source said. ``It is a mistake many
low-time pilots make.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane itself was not considered particularly difficult to
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The handling characteristics are very benign,'' said Warrent
Morningstar, director of media relations for the Aircraft Owners
and Pilots Association, a general aviation lobbying group. ``It is
not the sort of plane you would want to learn to fly in, but it
should not be a handful for a low-time pilot who had proper
training in the aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls began flooding into the Kennedy compound around 7
a.m. Saturday. President Clinton, who was spending the weekend at
Camp David, learned of the disappearance from his chief of staff,
John Podesta, and telephoned Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Andrew
Cuomo, the head of Housing and Urban Development, who is married to
Kerry Kennedy, a daughter of RFK.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called JFK Jr.'s sister, Caroline Kennedy
Schlossberg, who was reportedly on vacation out West. She was
expected to join the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our prayers and thoughts are with the families of those on
board,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's disappearance came one day before the 30th
anniversary of the day Edward Kennedy's car went off a dirt road at
Chappaquiddick, killing passenger Mary Jo Kopechne on the tiny
island adjacent to Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in May 1998, three weeks after he received his
pilot's license, Kennedy told USA Today that none of his relatives
could be persuaded to fly with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only person I've been able to get to go up with me, who
looks forward to it as much as I do, is my wife,'' he said.
``Whenever we want to get away, we can just get in a plane and fly
off.''

GUERRILLA WAR RAVAGES ECONOMY IN COLOMBIA

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Despite the huge body count from the recent
offensive by Marxist rebels, the economic carnage was almost as
shocking.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting began July 8 when guerrillas attacked the mountain
hamlet of Gutierrez, located just 25 miles south of Bogota. Army
generals erroneously portrayed the assault as a rebel push toward
the Colombian capital. Investors panicked and pulled millions of
dollars from the country. The Colombian peso lost 4 percent of its
value.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the headlines, you'd think it was Vietnam all over
again,'' says one New York-based financial analyst, referring to
the fall of Saigon to Communist rebels in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC,
rebels lack the wherewithal to seize major cities and steered clear
of Bogota. But the offensive, which left a combined death toll of
more than 300, illustrates how the combat and Colombia's image as a
chaotic nation on the brink can rattle the markets.
</P>
<P>
   Concern over the slumping economy has put more pressure on the
Colombian government to achieve a breakthrough in long-awaited
peace talks with the FARC, which are scheduled to begin on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiating teams will meet in Uribe, a village 100 miles south
of Bogota, to explore ways to end the 35-year-old conflict. The
last round of peace talks broke off in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced that if they don't make progress in the peace
process, Colombia is not going to be able to return to the levels
of economic growth that it needs,'' said Joel Korn, a country
analyst with the Inter-American Development Bank in Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever sensed so much concern and pessimism
about the way things are going,'' he said. ``People who have the
money to invest and are quite committed to being here are now
saying that it's just not worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, it was easier for business people to ignore the
fighting since it was confined to remote jungle areas and had
limited economic impact.
</P>
<P>
   But the FARC now has 17,000 fighters spread across much of the
country. The government spends vast sums to maintain its
146,000-man army and to rebuild wrecked infrastructure. Businesses
shell out millions for armored cars, security guards and kidnapping
insurance, since the guerrillas abduct hundreds of wealthy
Colombians and foreigners every year.
</P>
<P>
   Experts believe that the fighting and related security costs
shave between three and five points off Colombia's annual gross
domestic product, the sum of all goods and services produced within
the country's borders. After decades of robust growth, the economy
is expected to shrink this year by as much as 2 percent _ which
would be Colombia's worst performance since the Great Depression.
In the first quarter of this year, the economy contracted by 5.8
percent, compared to the first quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Finance Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo announced that,
for the first time in the country's history, Colombia was turning
to the International Monetary Fund for help. Colombia will receive
a $3 billion line of credit from the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone from business tycoons to the corner grocer feels the
heat.
</P>
<P>
   For Andres Sierra, a butcher in Bogota, the war means higher
meat prices because the FARC collects ``war taxes'' from ranchers
who, in turn, charge more for their cattle at the slaughterhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's come to the extreme where the simple farmer who grows a
plot of potatoes has to pay the rebels,'' Sierra said.
</P>
<P>
   At Alcimotores, a Bogota auto dealership, demand for luxury cars
and sport utility vehicles has plunged. A salesman explained that
buyers prefer stripped-down models to avoid the appearance of
wealth and the risk of being kidnapped at guerrilla roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict has touched off an international commercial
dispute. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez banned Colombian truck
drivers from entering his country last week in retaliation for the
threat of assaults, kidnappings and shakedowns that Venezuelan
truck drivers face on Colombian highways.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia truck drivers ``can go all the way to Caracas and
nothing happens to them,'' Chavez said. ``Venezuelan truck drivers
who go over there have to enter in war tanks to protect
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombians who can afford it are emigrating in droves. In the
first four months of this year, 65,000 Colombians left the country
and didn't return.
</P>
<P>
   At the U.S. Embassy in Bogota, applications for visas have
increased by 30 percent. In a recent Gallup poll of Colombians, 54
percent of the respondents said they have considered moving abroad
while 32 percent said they would marry a foreigner to facilitate
their departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want their kids to grow up this way, so if they
have a chance to leave, they go. It makes sense,'' said Roberto
Steiner, an economist at the University of the Andes in Bogota. He
warns that this ``brain drain'' will take years to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   But many Colombians believe that if negotiations with the
guerrillas are successful, the country would reap a substantial
``peace dividend.''
</P>
<P>
   Steiner points out that neighboring Peru suffered through 12
years of terror by Shining Path guerrillas. But after Shining Path
leader Abimael Guzman was captured in 1992, foreign investment
flowed and Peru's economy took off.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people hope that something similar happens here,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts point out, however, that the FARC has the upper hand in
the war and say that the demoralized Colombian army lacks the
manpower, weapons and commitment to defeat them. Meanwhile, it's
unclear whether the FARC really wants peace.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations were originally scheduled to begin in January, but
FARC leader Manuel ``Sure Shot'' Marulanda skipped the inaugural
ceremony. Since then, the rebels have delayed the start-up date
while carrying out a wave of spectacular assaults on army and
police units. All along, they have refused pleas for a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Because the rebels are stronger than ever, the government may
have to offer major concessions to forge a truce.
</P>
<P>
   Just to persuade the FARC to come to the table, the government
withdrew troops from five municipalities in southern Colombia and
proclaimed the region a demilitarized zone. The rebels launched
raids from bases inside the zone during their latest offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to prepare ourselves for the idea that peace
will be very costly. In the short and medium term, it will have
more costs than benefits,'' said Juan Jose Echavarria, director of
Fedesarollo, a private Bogota think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe that the talks could quickly break down because
the two sides have little in common. On economic issues, for
example, the government has pursued an aggressive free-market
approach while the guerrillas are dogmatic Marxists.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC wants half of the national budget dedicated to health
and education and has called for state management of
telecommunications, ports and natural resources, such as oil.
Marulanda, the FARC leader, has reportedly said that even
Colombia's newspapers should be run by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any economic idea that comes from the guerrillas is bad,''
said Steiner, the University of the Andes economist. ``They are
communists. They have spent 30 years studying a model that doesn't
work. And the model that does work, they don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Few economists believe that the government will consider deep
structural changes.
</P>
<P>
   But the two sides do share common ground on points like agrarian
reform and the need for sustained development in rural areas. From
the beginning, poverty in the countryside and distorted ratios of
land distribution have helped fueled the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where you should make the biggest concessions,'' said
Juan Pablo Gonzalez, vice president of the Bogota Stock Exchange.
``But if profitability in the countryside is negative, you don't
solve anything by distributing the land among many people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing you get is a larger number of bankrupt
people.''

 &HT;    It feels like our pain, but grief is personal
 &HT;    By Thomas Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There is little point in regretting the avalanche of
media attention that greeted the news of yet another Kennedy
tragedy, when you are a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   The Bessettes faced Saturday the loss of two of their daughters,
with no preparation for such a tragedy, while the Kennedys, grimly
conditioned to the public rituals of grief, were confronted with
the loss of yet another son. That isn't the point either: All
families sooner or later confront the loss of those who were young
and full of promise, and are gone too soon.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedys, on the other hand, are a family fused into the
American psyche in a unique way.
</P>
<P>
   With the news of a plane lost off the Atlantic coast, the memory
of the boy, who was too young to really know heartache, bravely
saluting as his father's coffin passed by, comes effortlessly to
mind. The tender smiles of 1963 are recalled and the news of 1999
brings us back, with a somber sense of completion, to what we
mourned so long ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the media's mad rush to tell every part of the story, to
pinpoint precisely how the plane went down and locate, again, those
with some association with the family, Americans feel the illusion
of personal connection.
</P>
<P>
   So it is inescapable that we will tell this story in an outsize
way, and add to the Pharaonic tradition in which every turn of bad
luck in a family's history becomes an integral part of ours. But to
be decent to John F. Kennedy Jr. and the two women with him, we
still ought to try to make a distinction between public fascination
and private grief.
</P>
<P>
   It was said of JFK Jr. that he wanted to be an actor when he was
younger, which should come as no surprise. He had movie star looks,
but more than that, he had spent his entire life in the
presentation of a public image that had to vary from the emotions
of the private self.
</P>
<P>
   It was not possible, however, for the president's son to pursue
roles very different from those for which he had been born. He had
an indifferent career as a lawyer and seemed averse to the family
business, which, of course, was politics. Ultimately he found his
calling as the publisher of a magazine, George, which treats
politics with the sensibilities of an actor.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the best accommodation he could have made. George
is not a great magazine for those who truly love the sweaty push
and pull of politics, but on its pages Kennedy was able to approach
the world in the same way it had treated him. He gave us
politicians wrapped in the scented gloss of celebrity, political
events gussied up as media myth.
</P>
<P>
   How much, in the execution of a glamorous lifestyle, Kennedy was
haunted by the obligations of the myth that made him, we can never
know. His decision to turn away from the life of a candidate hints
at a certain uneasiness.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to strike another bargain with fame, but the loss of
his plane was too dramatic a story for him to escape becoming
another Kennedy, offered up on the Aztec altar of American
celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   His family faced the news this weekend in a way no others can,
no matter how much we think we know them. The true end of the
Kennedy curse will come when they can mourn their dead and deal
with their tragedies in just the way the rest of us do.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- John F. Kennedy Jr., who crawled out from under his
father's Oval Office desk into a life of tragedy-tinged celebrity,
was presumed dead Saturday along with his wife and her sister when
the small plane he was piloting apparently crashed off Martha's
Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Hope that the glamorous and free-spirited member of the nation's
most chronicled political family had simply made an unscheduled
landing dimmed when wreckage and luggage were found off Philbin's
Beach at the westernmost end of the island. A short walk down the
beach is the Vineyard home that Kennedy and his sister inherited
from their mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   As darkness fell, no bodies had been found, and an intensive
search involving the Coast Guard, Air Force, Air National Guard,
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Civil Air Patrol,
and scores of private vessels continued into the night.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said it was too early to speculate on the cause of
the crash, but preliminary efforts are focusing on Kennedy's
becoming disoriented because of poor visibility and losing control
of the plane, fuel mismanagement, or loss of control after doing a
flyby of the family property.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 38, a onetime Manhattan prosecutor who left the law to
become publisher of George magazine, was accompanied by his wife,
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her older sister, Lauren Bessette.
They were aboard his single-engine Piper Saratoga II HP, a plane
the novice pilot had purchased just 10 weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and his wife planned to drop off her sister on Martha's
Vineyard, then head to Hyannis for the wedding of a cousin, Rory
Kennedy, daughter of the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy. The
wedding scheduled for Saturday was postponed, and plans for a
celebratory Mass were replaced by the familiar and familial sound
of mournful prayers.
</P>
<P>
   The entourage had set out about 8:30 p.m. Friday from Essex
County Airport in Fairfield, N.J., and was expected to land at
Martha's Vineyard Airport by 10 p.m. Kennedy was not required to
file a flight plan, and had not done so.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who received his solo pilot license last year, took off
into a hazy sky from the New Jersey airport, and some pilots
questioned whether he was experienced enough to fly under such
conditions. Kennedy was not certified to fly solely via
instruments, and would have had to rely on visual cues.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Bailey, an experienced private pilot who also had planned
to fly from New Jersey to Martha's Vineyard Friday night, changed
his mind when he saw the sky. ``I felt it was too hazy and I didn't
want to chance it over open water,'' said Bailey, who said he saw
the Kennedy group at the airport, with Kennedy arriving in a white
convertible and wearing a backward baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said he noticed Kennedy was limping around the plane
during his preflight check; Kennedy had hurt himself several weeks
ago in a paragliding accident. Kennedy arrived at the airport
around 8 p.m.; his wife arrived shortly after and they left without
delay.
</P>
<P>
   Once airborne, Kennedy made no voice contact with the Martha's
Vineyard Airport, but his six-seat, red-and-white plane was last
spotted on the island airport's radar at 9:39 p.m. on what appeared
to be a final approach to the landing strip.
</P>
<P>
   A review of radar records showed the plane was 17 miles
west/southwest of the airport at an altitude of 2,200 feet. On the
next radar pass, 12 seconds later, the plane had dropped to 1,300
feet. Twelve seconds later, the plane was nowhere to be seen,
sources with the Federal Aviation Administration said.
</P>
<P>
   The precipitous drop in altitude apparently did not trigger
action by flight controllers because, without a flight plan and
without voice contact, they had no reason to pay the aircraft any
heed and might not have even noticed the drop, according to FAA
officials and authorities on flight procedures.
</P>
<P>
   While family and friends held vigil at the Kennedys' Hyannis
Port compound, the feared death of the man known to the world as
``John-John'' added a sad new chapter to a family history in which
glory and sorrow alternate like day and night.
</P>
<P>
   The victories have come mainly from voters and wise investments,
while the losses have come from even more capricious sources,
including assassins, drugs, and the trees of Aspen. Even before
Friday's apparent plane crash, the family has suffered the fate of
Icarus before: Kennedy's uncle, Navy Lieutenant Joseph P. Kennedy
Jr., died in 1944 when his bomber exploded over England; his aunt,
Kathleen (Kennedy) Harrington, was killed in 1948 when the plane
she was aboard crashed in the mountains of France.
</P>
<P>
   Fears about John F. Kennedy Jr., his 33-year-old wife, and her
sister began in earnest sometime after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:15 a.m., a friend of the Kennedys called the Coast Guard
station in Woods Hole to say Kennedy and Bessette were late. Woods
Hole called the Coast Guard's Boston station, which in turn called
the FAA. The FAA and Air Force then began calling other airports to
see if the plane had landed somewhere else or perhaps never took
off.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, a satellite picked up an emergency beacon
signal off Montauk, N.Y. No immediate action was taken because it
is standard procedure to wait for additional beacon ``hits'' to
pinpoint the location of a downed airplane, said Coast Guard Petty
Officer Todd Burgun in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   After a second beacon signal was received, a ``case'' was opened
at 3:28 a.m. by the Air Force's Air Rescue Coordination Center,
which oversees searches for missing aircraft. However, it was not
known whether the signal had come from Kennedy's plane because the
beacon did not have a ``signature'' to indicate its source.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:30 a.m., a 41-foot Coast Guard utility vessel began
searching the area off Montauk, followed by another utility boat
and several larger vessels in the predawn hours. They found
nothing. At dawn, the Civil Air Patrol of the Air Force joined the
search with 15 single-engine planes, focusing almost exclusively
along the Long Island coastline.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the sky were two Coast Guard H60 Jayhawk helicopters, a
Coast Guard Falcon jet, and a huge C-130 from the Air National
Guard, which provided in-flight air traffic control of the search
planes. The same plane was involved in the aftermath of the crash
of TWA flight 800, which plunged into nearby waters three years ago
to the day.

 &HT;    Nobody knows Hemingway like his fightin' friends
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I wanted to hear the ear story, but the first thing I got were
the feet.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as I showed up, unannounced, at Shine Forbes' little
bungalow at the corner of Fort and Geraldine in a side pocket of
Key West, I began to see why the guy had been a favorite of Ernest
Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   This guy was a character. The outside of his house _ designated
by a homemade ``Shine's Ponderosa'' sign _ shows a puckish bent on
life. There are mounted steer horns, a trombone, pictures of Howdy
Doody and Hemingway and a hodge-podge of other kitsch and corn.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of knocks at the door, a young woman answered and
let me inside the cramped quarters, where the walls were covered
with hundreds of pictures and cards. She told me Shine wasn't home
and asked why I wanted him.
</P>
<P>
   I told her I wanted to talk about Hemingway and boxing. I told
her that Shine's lifelong friend _ Iron Baby Roberts _ had told me
Shine once had been the best boxer on the island.
</P>
<P>
   As I talked, my eyes happened to settle on the faded blue
curtain that hung over a doorway to the back room. Jutting from the
bottom of the curtain was a pair of bare feet. Someone was there
and I figured I knew who it was. I kept talking about Shine _ how
Hemingway had singled him out, how Iron Baby said he rarely was
beaten.
</P>
<P>
   And with that, the curtain was flung back and out stepped Shine
Forbes, who, with a gleaming, gold-toothed grin, announced: ``I'm
here!''
</P>
<P>
   At the time Shine was close to 70, though his trim, well-muscled
body and neatly clipped beard and moustache made him look 20 years
younger. In fact, he didn't look much different than he did in
those two pictures on the wall of Hemingway and him _from the late
1930s.
</P>
<P>
   No mention was made of the curtain trick. I figured Shine just
wanted to see who he was dealing with before he got involved. That
wasn't always the case _ which was why I was there that afternoon
almost 15 years ago. And it's why we spoke by phone again a few
days ago and why today I'm yelling you this story.
</P>
<P>
   With the centennial of the Nobel laureate's birth on Wednesday,
it seems as if everyone is remembering Hemingway. Celebrations are
underway today in Hemingway's hometown of Oak Park, Ill., as well
as Paris, Havana, Pamplona, Spain, Washington, D.C., Petroskey,
Mich., Ketchum, Idaho, Dania, Fla., Piggott, Ark., and, of course,
Key West, with its annual Hemingway Days.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nobody has Hemingway stories quite as sweaty, bruising and
real as do Kermit ``Shine'' Forbes and James ``Iron Baby'' Roberts
_ Papa's pugs, Papa's pals
</P>
<P>
   Back in the 1930s, they used to put on gritty club fights in Key
West at an outdoor ring next to the Blue Heaven bar, pool hall _
and some say, bordello _ at the corner of Thomas and Petronia.
Today, the place is a popular faux, funk restaurant, but there are
reminders of the past. The rooster graveyard in the courtyard is
from the days when cock fights were as popular as the boxing shows.
</P>
<P>
   The place is only a few blocks from that fabled, coral rock
mansion on Whitehead Street where Hemingway lived from 1928-1939.
While in Key West, he produced more than two-thirds of his life's
work, including Death in the Afternoon, To Have and Have Not, For
Whom the Bell Tolls, as well as classic short stories like The
Snows of Kilimanjaro.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the literati scene, Hemingway found Key West energized
him. It kept him in fighting form. He rose at dawn every morning,
slipped back into his second floor study in the coach house, eased
into his old cigar maker's chair and wrote until noon. Afternoons
were for fishing and the night for carousing. Often, he made his
way to the Blue Heaven.
</P>
<P>
   He was fascinated by the fight shows put on by a Cuban boxer and
barkeep named Josey Mills. He had a lifetime passion for boxing and
already at 16, he had turned his mother's music room into a
makeshift gym so he could box with schoolmates, most of whom were
smaller and subject to his bullying tactics. Later, he took boxing
lessons and had his nose broken at a Chicago gym.
</P>
<P>
   As a young expatriate in Paris, he sparred with poet Ezra Pound
and had many spirited sessions with Canadian novelist _ and
one-time fighter _ Morley Callagan. Once he got to the tropics, the
battles got tougher. He knocked out publisher Joseph Knapp on the
docks in Bimini, then boasted he'd give $100 to any local who could
stay in the ring with him for four rounds. No one did. There also
was a brawling exhibition with heavyweight contender Tom Heeney and
a much-celebrated duke-out of poet Wallace Stevens at Sloppy Joe's
Bar in Key West.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway believed sports gave man his best chance to make the
transition from coward to courage. He often wrote about the sport -
from his powerful short story ``Fifty Grand,'' about a boxer who
would not take a dive, to ``The Sun Also Rises,'' where the chief
character was once a middleweight champ.
</P>
<P>
   As for Hemingway's participation, he once wrote: ``My only
approach to truth was to have the experience directly and try to
write as well as I can about what happened while I was there.''
</P>
<P>
   And what better place to immerse himself than the Blue Heaven.
He was there the night Mills took on an overmatched Alfred ``Black
Pie'' Colebrooks, who asked Iron Baby and Shine to work his corner.
</P>
<P>
   Shine _ who'd left town as a teenager on a freight train loaded
with Cuban pineapples and had just returned after six years on the
road _ didn't recognize the burly, sun baked man who agreed to ref
the bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a bunch of beard, long hair and old khaki shorts held
up by a rope,'' Shine said. ``I thought he was a bum trying to earn
money for a drink.''
</P>
<P>
   As Iron Baby once remembered the fight: ``Black Pie musta got
knocked down four of five times. Finally, Shine got tired of it, so
he threw a white towel in the ring. The ref tossed it back, so
Shine throwed it in a second time. Then a third and a fourth, but
the ref would have none of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shine picked up the story: ``I was on the ring apron when the
towel hit me in the face. I jumped over the ropes and took a poke
at the ref. I missed and kinda landed in his arms and that's when
he grabbed me by the ears and started shaking me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway stood 6-foot and weighed some 210 pounds. Shine _ who
often fought under the name ``The Battlin' Geech'' _ was 5-foot-6
and 135 pounds. Shine's buddies couldn't believe his brashness and
local cops poured into the ring to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was saying to Shine, 'you know who you swung at?'''
Iron Baby said. ``He said he didn't give a damn, but they said he
better 'cause that was the great writer, Ernest Hemingway.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway studied the fiery little man he held in his paws and
refused to press charges. ``The next day people told me I should go
beg Mr. Hemingway's pardon,'' Shine said. ``I did, but Hemingway
just laughed. He said that glory and spunk had made me do that
'cause most men wouldn't of had the guts to jump in the ring with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway had a ring set up in his yard, two speed bags, a heavy
bag and various sets of gloves. He invited Shine, Iron Baby and a
few other boxers to spar with him each day. He paid 50 cents a
round, but Iron Baby claimed after the most vigorous sessions he'd
``shower $20 bills on us.''
</P>
<P>
   As Shine remembered: ``I can still see Ernest Hemingway in the
ring. He was big and didn't move real well, but he could take it.
He held his fists up jabbing, old -time style.''
</P>
<P>
   With the difference in size and noticing Shine's drooping eyelid
and milky left eye, you asked Iron Baby if Hemingway had done that
to his partner? Iron Baby looked surprised and shook his head. He
explained that it happened long ago when Shine was having trouble
with his wife. He followed her to another woman's home and that
woman opened the door and flung a jar filled with potash and
molasses in his face. The molasses made the solution stick and the
potash severely burned the eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody hurt Shine in the ring,'' Baby said. ``He was a hell of
a fighter. Only lost a couple fights in his career. He was born to
be a boxer.''
</P>
<P>
   Iron Baby was, too: ``My daddy was a boxer. In them days he was
one of the strongest men in the city. No one could whip him. Pretty
soon they called him Iron Daddy. As for me, well, I was his baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, both are old men. Shine is 83, Iron Baby, a few years
older, and according to Shine a couple days ago, ``real sick and
close to dying.''
</P>
<P>
   But this week _ as centennial celebrations fill the land _ no
stories have more life than those of Shine and Iron Baby
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the last times we saw Hemingway was a Christmas Eve,''
Shine said. ``These were poor times in Key West. I mean we didn't
have change for a quarter. Then all of a sudden here comes
Hemingway walking through the neighborhood. He had some guests over
to the house and wanted to know if we'd put on a boxing show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went and there with the big shots was Gene Tunney. He had
been the heavyweight champ and Ernest wanted him to see us box. And
we put on a hell of a show. Baby got so worked up he tried to knock
me out. Afterward Hemingway passed a hat and got over $200 for us.
It was the best Christmas ever.''
</P>
<P>
   With that came another golden-toothed laugh: ``That big poke I
took at Ernest Hemingway? Oh man, that was the greatest thing that
ever happened to me in my life! It kinda got me famous.''
</P>
<P>
   ...Famous enough that sometimes you even recognize him by his
feet.

A CALL OF ALARM, THEN DEBRIS AND A GROWING SENSE OF DREAD

 By ROSS KERBER AND CARLOS MONTJE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The call came in to the Coast Guard station in Woods Hole about
2:15 a.m.: An airplane piloted by John F. Kennedy Jr., expected to
arrive on Martha's Vineyard just before 10 p.m., had not shown up.
</P>
<P>
   It took nearly an hour and a half longer before an initial
search was launched and the plane's disappearance officially noted.
</P>
<P>
   By dawn Saturday, hundreds of military and civilian rescuers had
begun to scan about 6,000 square miles of ocean and coastline from
Long Island to Martha's Vineyard, searching for clues to the
aircraft's location.
</P>
<P>
   At about 1:30 p.m., in the surf near Aquinnah, some clues were
found: a headrest, bits of carpet, an aircraft support with a wheel
attached, and a canvas bag with identification from Kennedy's
sister-in-law _ one of the passengers on board the Piper Saratoga
II HP.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Kennedy's plane, which took off from Essex County
Airport in Fairfield, N.J., had been missing for 15 1/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the debris, Coast Guard officials Saturday believed
that the airplane had ditched into the Atlantic, perhaps miles
short of the airport in West Tisbury, Mass. Saturday night, Kennedy
and his passengers, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her
sister, Lauren Bessette, were presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always hope but unfortunately when you find certain
pieces of evidence, you have to be prepared for anything that
happens,'' said Coast Guard Lieutenant Gary L. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The search, which included 20 helicopters, jets, and light
airplanes and several Coast Guard cutters and boats, was scheduled
to continue through the night, with sonar equipment brought in from
a nearby federal research agency.
</P>
<P>
   But without more wreckage or a signal from the plane's on-board
radio transponder, one officer said, trying to find the aircraft in
such a massive search field was frustrating. Kennedy also had not
filed a flight plan, a routine omission but one that may have
delayed the start of the rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we saw were waves breaking on rocks,'' said Greg Buonomo,
a Suffolk County, N.Y., police officer who flew a Bell 206
helicopter from Islip, N.Y. to participate in the search.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing out there,'' said his partner, Steve DeMeo.
``If there is a search, you hope to find something.''
</P>
<P>
   The long delay before the start of the search prompted some
pointed questions to Air Force officials at a Pentagon briefing
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieutenant Colonel Steve Roark said searchers had not
received a radio signal from the downed craft and decided to follow
procedure and wait for daylight before beginning aerial missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at possible other landing sites . . . rather than just
sending out aircraft willy-nilly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roark also said the amount of resources devoted to the search
was not influenced by Kennedy's celebrity status, as the son of
John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We treat all the searches the same,'' he said. ``There is no
difference between celebrity and noncelebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   The six-seat Piper Saratoga had left the New Jersey airport
about 8:30 p.m. Friday and was apparently tracked by FAA radar
officers as it approached the airport in West Tisbury until as late
as 9:39 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Flying conditions were considered marginal because of a haze
over the water, although visibility was about 3 miles and stars and
a crescent moon could be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kennedy was flying under what are known as ``visual
flight rules'' and was not in constant communication with the
airport tower. Controllers likely assumed the plane had landed
safely when it left the screen, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, officials only began to receive warnings after
around 2 a.m., they said, when family friends called in.
</P>
<P>
   The first search aircraft took off around 7:30 a.m., the Air
Force said. About 15 Civil Air Patrol planes were also dispatched,
focusing on areas along the coastline and inland areas near
Kennedy's presumed flight path.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, searchers focused on the coordinates of a brief, weak
radio emergency beacon, recorded around 2 a.m. off Mattituck, N.Y.
But that proved to be a false alarm, and by midmorning the search
had been expanded to include the entire length of the plane's
planned route from New Jersey up the coast.
</P>
<P>
   After searching for hours without results, a rare piece of hard
data turned up: a black canvas bag, floating in the surf near
Aquinnah shortly after noon. A group of friends sunbathing on the
beach spotted the luggage.
</P>
<P>
   The bag's ID tag contained a Morgan Stanley business card from
Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible sinking feeling,'' said Damon Seligson, 30,
a Boston lawyer who said he swam out to retrieve the luggage. ``I
felt my heart burst out of my chest; it was just terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The find helped direct searchers to areas much closer to
Martha's Vineyard; by evening, authorities said they had
concentrated on an area 17 miles southwest of the airport, where a
debris field had begun to surface.
</P>
<P>
   Another grim find came around 1:30 p.m. when a Coast Guard crew
working in a small boat near the coast of Aquinnah found pieces of
carpet and the headrest. Coast Guard Lieutenant Gary L. Jones said
the items were ``consistent with a plane crash.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones also said bits of identifiable luggage had been found, but
he would not give specifics.
</P>
<P>
   The wreckage was found less than a mile from the estate of
Kennedy's late mother, Jacqueline Kenn

 &HT;    U.S. regains a step in doubles
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The U.S. Davis Cup team, desperate to escape
a 2-0 hole for the first time in 64 years, beat and teased the
Australians on Saturday by breaking their 12-match winning streak
in doubles and hinting that Pete Sampras will be inserted into the
singles lineup today to face Patrick Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, playing with Alex O'Brien, served out the 6-4, 6-3,
3-6, 4-6, 6-3 victory over Mark Woodforde and Sandon Stolle to
close the Aussies' lead to 2-1. A classic doubles match, it took
three hours, 27 minutes as the temperature reached a record 98 at
the Longwood Cricket Club.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, U.S. captain Tom Gullikson boosted American hopes
further by saying Sampras may play singles after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't rule it out,'' Gullikson said. ``Our backs are
still to the wall, and we've got to throw everything into the
matches tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis Cup rules prevent substituting singles players unless
there is an injury. Todd Martin, scheduled to play Rafter in the
opening match at 1 p.m., has a right elbow injury that's chronic,
and he recieved treatment for an unspecified complaint after
Friday's match, a four-set loss to Lleyton Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd has been a medical marvel this whole year,'' Gullikson
said. ``He's been in two states since Jan. 1 _ playing competitive
matches or rehabbing. He's really not been healthy all year, and he
manages to win matches, so he has an assortment of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Martin appeared healthy Saturday when he was found
practicing after the doubles match, executing overheads with ease.
Asked if he was fit, he said, ``Don't ask me stupid questions.''
</P>
<P>
   And following Friday's singles, Martin said he'd be willing to
play doubles if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras has maintained since joining the team that he'd play
singles only if there was an injury to Martin or Jim Courier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we're going to talk about,'' Sampras said. ``We
will keep everyone posted.''
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's doubles, Sampras and O'Brien weren't broken until
the eighth game of the third set. O'Brien was the first to falter,
a loose game lost at love, and then Sampras was broken to open the
fourth set.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the fourth, (Gullikson) was like, 'What are you guys doing
out there, you look like a bunch of plumbers,' `` Sampras said.
``There is not a ton of strategy involved at that point. It's more
insiration.''
</P>
<P>
   The decisive moment came in the fifth set at 3-4 with Woodbridge
serving. The former world No. 1 in doubles led 30-love and hadn't
faced a service break in six games, but he double-faulted twice for
30-all. After a netcord helped give Sampras and O'Brien another
break point, the Aussies saved it with the point of the match, one
that required five overheads to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones where the boys were smashing and the Americans
retrieved, I thought this is as good as it gets in sport,''
Australian captain John Newcombe said. ``That last half hour was a
sporting spectacle.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was O'Brien who won the game with quick defensive lob
that got over Stolle's head for a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras ran out to a 30-love lead in the deciding game but ran
into O'Brien trying to hit an overhead to make it 30-all. Sampras
then broke a string serving at 30-all and missed the first volley.
</P>
<P>
   The Australians hadn't lost a doubles match in Newcombe's four
years as captain. Ten of their 12 straight wins were registered by
Woodforde and Todd Woodbridge, but Woodbridge pulled out last week
because of an arm injury. Stolle is ranked No. 4 in doubles but was
making his Davis Cup doubles debut.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are 1-28 after trailing 2-0 in Davis Cup, winning
only in a 1934 semifinal against Australia, but they've won 21
straight Davis Cup ties when winning the doubles point.

 &HT;    U.S. still no shoo-in in doubles
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Pete Sampras is in and Todd Woodbridge is
out, but it doesn't mean that the United States is favored to win
the doubles point today.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras has played doubles four times in Davis Cup, winning
twice with John McEnroe in 1992 and once with Todd Martin in 1995,
but Sampras and Martin were beaten by Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde
in the 1997 semifinal against Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can play good doubles,'' Sampras said. ``It's still the same
sport out there _ keep it in the lines and serve big and return
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aussies were weakened when Woodbridge took himself off the
team last week, citing a sore arm and poor confidence. He was
replaced by Sandon Stolle, ranked No. 4 in the world in doubles and
winner of the U.S. Open with Cyril Suk.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras' partner, Alex O'Brien, has lost both of his Davis Cup
doubles matches, including a five-set defeat against England's Tim
Henman and Greg Rusedski in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Davis Cup rules allow captains to change their doubles pairings
as close as an hour before the scheduled match, which would be 1
p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   The legends of Longwood
</P>
<P>
   The Longwood Cricket Club is known as the oldest tennis club in
the country and the site of the first Davis Cup competition, but
neither claim is precisely correct. Bud Collins calls Longwood
``the oldest significant tennis club in the U.S.,'' which probably
doesn't appease the New Orleans Lawn Tennis Club, established a
year before Longwood in 1876. The first Davis Cup competition,
between the United States and a British Isles team, was played at
Longwood's original location in 1900. The club was moved a few
blocks to its present site in 1922 and still provides lawn tennis
to its members.
</P>
<P>
   Winning on principle
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gullikson's decision to adhere to Sampras' wishes to play
only doubles opens the way for criticism if the U.S. team doesn't
win. It is reminiscent of another sporting but unusual move by the
1971 U.S. captain, Ed Turville. The United States was going to play
Romania in the final in Charlotte, and Turville didn't think it was
fair to put the Romanians on hardcourts, which favored the
Americans. So he ordered clay to make it ``entertaining for the
fans.'' Cliff Richey quit the team in protest, but his replacement,
Frank Froehling, defeated Ion Tiriac in five sets, and Stan Smith
upset Ilie Nastase, and the U.S. prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   The United States leads the Davis Cup series with Australia
25-19, although the Aussies lead in finals 15-14. ... The U.S. team
is 9-3 when Sampras plays, 9-3 when he doesn't. ... The 362 media
credentials issued represent a record for a U.S. Davis Cup match,
which was sold out in 81 minutes and attracted scalpers asking for
$250 a ticket. ... Former President George Bush attended Friday's
matches. Bush's uncle, Joseph Ware, was captain of the 1928 and '35
U.S. teams. Other celebrities in attendance included Jason
Alexander, Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow and Orlando Cepeda. ...
ESPN2 is televising a six-hour Davis Cup commemorative today,
beginning at 10 a.m. and will feature the 1982 McEnroe-Mats
Wilander match, won by McEnroe in five sets, and the 1987
McEnroe-Boris Becker match, won by Becker in five.

COUNTING THE KENNEDYS, COUNTING THE TRAGEDIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Originally moved as Kennedy-Anniversary)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has come to the point when Kennedy tragedy now seems to
overshadow Kennedy triumph, when the passage of time is marked not
by political conquests, but by soulful gatherings to grieve the
loss of another young son.
</P>
<P>
   With each death goes a little more of the glory, and those close
to the family said the feared loss of John Kennedy Jr., his young
wife and her sister is incomprehensibly sad. ``A devastating
blow,'' said William Manchester, a Kennedy friend, historian and
author of ``Death of a President.'' ``He embodied a lot of the
family qualities.'' Added Kennedy confidant Paul Kirk: ``It makes
your heart sick just to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some call it a curse, which seems an inadequate cliche at such
times. Others say that a family that persists in living on the edge
is being forced to suffer the consequences of its risky ways. They
fly their own single-engine planes when they can afford to hire
pilots. They ski without poles on the hardest hills of Aspen on the
last run of a December afternoon. They coax their way into the
military in hopes of facing combat. It is and always has been the
Kennedy way.
</P>
<P>
   ``John follows the family tradition that the man should live
this intrepid life,'' said Laurence Leamer, author of ``The Kennedy
Women,'' who is researching a book on the Kennedy men. ``He should
have been a coupon clipper, a wealthy guy going to his clubs. But
he wouldn't live that kind of life.''
</P>
<P>
   As a wedding celebration on the rolling lawn of the Hyannis Port
compound Saturday instead became an overnight, tear-choked vigil,
the legion of Kennedy friends and followers asked how much
misfortune this clan can take.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rose Kennedy used to say that the Lord never sends you a
burden too heavy to bear,'' said Frank Mankiewicz, a family adviser
for decades. ``I wonder now. It's getting close.''
</P>
<P>
   All Kennedy tragedies take their inevitable toll, but the feared
loss of John Kennedy somehow burns with a special poignancy. Aside
from his uncle, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, John Kennedy Jr. is the
best known of his family, the son of a late president, untarnished
by scandal, instilled with good sense by a mother _ Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis _ who sought to protect him from the prying media.
Devastatingly handsome and generally good-natured, he was voted the
sexiest man alive by People Magazine. His life, in short, has been
suffused with extraordinary vitality; he seems unimaginable in
death.
</P>
<P>
   His feared loss haunts in so many eerie ways. He disappeared on
the same weekend near the same island where 30 years before,
Senator Kennedy drove off a bridge on his way back from a
Chappaquiddick party. The elder Kennedy escaped, but his aide, Mary
Jo Kopechne, was later found dead in the submerged car. The
controversy over Kennedy's role and delayed call to authorities
derailed his presidential ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy Jr. would also be the third in his extended family
to die in a plane crash. On Aug. 12, 1944, Navy Lieutenant Joseph
P. Kennedy Jr., the eldest son of family matriarch and patriarch
Rose and Joseph, died when the bomber he was piloting exploded
during a mission meant to destroy rocket-launching sites in
Normandy, France. He was 29 years old.
</P>
<P>
   On May 13, 1948, Kathleen Kennedy, daughter of Rose and Joseph,
was killed when the chartered plane she was aboard crashed in the
Cevennes Mountains in southern France.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Kennedy narrowly survived a plane crash on June 19, 1964
outside of Springfield, where he was to appear at a Democratic
State Committee convention. He fractured his spine in six places; a
Kennedy aide and the plane's pilot were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The scroll of the Kennedy dead has grown mercilessly _ victims
of bullets, drugs, their own excesses and misfortunes. John Kennedy
was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963 in Dallas, his brother, Robert F.
Kennedy, on June 5, 1968 in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willpower, just willpower, and doing what's necessary is what
keeps me going,'' Rose Kennedy once said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Rose died in January 1995 at 104 years of age, she buried
a grandson, David Kennedy, RFK's son, who was found dead of a drug
overdose in a Palm Beach hotel in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, who has since served and retired
from Congress, was involved in a car crash that left a woman
paralyzed for life. His brother, Michael, stood accused of having
an affair with his children's teenaged baby sitter. He died in a
skiing accident on New Year's Eve 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Cousin William Kennedy Smith was accused of committing a rape at
the family's Palm Beach compound. After a highly celebrated trial,
he was acquitted in 1991 and has gone on to become a doctor. The
family estate has since been sold.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know the Kennedys say that in tragedy, they turn to
themselves and to prayer, and Saturday seemed no different as they
secluded themselves in their Cape Cod getaway with several priests
and a steady stream of visitors. A spokesman said they joined in
hearing Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life can be unfair,'' said Kirk, who has advised several
Kennedys. ``With this family, you have to say that sometimes it
asks too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their mantra was that everyone could make a difference and
each of us should try,'' Kirk added. ``But they fall much too
early, much too young. This is another promise dashed.''

FOR A NATION, HE WILL ALWAYS BE `JOHN-JOHN' 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He'll be remembered always as that little boy who
stood at attention and saluted his father's flag-draped coffin as
it passed in front of him on a dark November day some 36 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That image was burned forever into the nation's psyche.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with some disbelief that Americans awoke Saturday
morning to learn that young ``John-John,'' the toddler who used to
romp beneath his father's desk in the Oval Office, was missing at
age 38 off the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard along with
the plane he was piloting and his wife and sister-in-law who were
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy Jr. turned 3 on the day his assassinated father
was buried, and his life has been anything but normal ever since.
</P>
<P>
   But the only surviving son of the nation's 35th president
struggled to live normally as best he could, despite the so-called
``curse'' of the Kennedy family mystique.
</P>
<P>
   He worked hard to shun the spotlight most of his life _ through
college at Brown University, law school, and then later as a junior
prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney's office, where he
won six cases.
</P>
<P>
   Still, those were trying times for him. He flunked his New York
bar exam twice and was hounded by the media after being linked
romantically to Madonna and dubbed by People magazine as ``the
sexiest man in America.''
</P>
<P>
   It was about that time that friends revealed that Kennedy had
decided that law was not necessarily his calling, and he gave up
his job in the district attorney's office .
</P>
<P>
   Although he was not always clear about where he was going with
his life, he always seemed to be amazingly grounded for a member of
the nation's most pre-eminent and tragic family, and for a young
man who was often referred to in profiles of the Kennedys as
``America's prince.''
</P>
<P>
   In his early 30s, however, he seemed to find his calling as a
New York magazine publisher and journalist. Finally embracing the
media limelight, he used his celebrity status in 1995 to help
launch George Magazine, which pokes fun at American politics with a
combination of substance and fluff. The venture seemed to make him
happy.
</P>
<P>
   Putting out the magazine, he told a reporter two years ago, ``is
the most fun I've ever had,'' and he agreed with those who observed
that George was a way for him to be involved in politics like his
father and other famous Kennedy family members without really
having to run for office.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Kennedy never ruled out the possibility of a career
in politics and joked that his magazine might be useful as ``a
launching pad'' should he ever decide to seek elected office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't ruled out going into politics in the future,''
Kennedy told a group of European reporters last November. ``I don't
have any specific plans. I don't have any clear ideas. It's more of
a prospect.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``right now,'' he added, ``I'm a journalist and I like that
a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   As news of the missing plane spread Saturday, old Kennedy family
friends and even average Americans who didn't know much about him
said they had always hoped that one day he might eventually follow
in his father's footsteps and run for national office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what the future would have held,'' John
Seigenthaler, a friend and former adviser to Robert F. Kennedy,
told NBC News.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just a real tragedy if its true,'' said Grover
Sands, a 41-year old tourist from Maryland who brought his family
Saturday to see the White House. ``I think he might have run for
office, and I think it would have been real interesting ... I think
a lot of Americans love the idea that another Kennedy could be
president one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore also paid tribute to Kennedy at an
appearance in Los Angeles, noting that he had set a remarkable
example for all Americans during his life given the tragedies that
have dogged his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the age of 3, he was the most famous person in the world
because with his innocent and brave young heart he helped the
nation and the world endure some of the hardest hours of our
history,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has carried his legend with enormous grace and with a
commitment to live up to his father's legacy, his mother's love.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was born Nov. 25, 1960, the second child of former
President Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline. Another son, Patrick
Bouvier Kennedy, was born premature Aug. 7, 1963, and died two days
later. John Kennedy's older sister, Caroline, was born in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Along with his sister, Kennedy sought throughout his life to
dedicate himself to public service even though both continued to
shy away from political office. Together the two sought to help the
poor and disadvantaged, not only by volunteering their services but
with considerable money as well. The two founded a number of
charities and public service organizations together aimed at
helping children and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The two also dedicated themselves to upholding their father and
mother's legacies. When Jacqueline Kennedy died in 1994, Caroline
took over the Profiles in Courage awards program at the Kennedy
Library and John began overseeing the Kennedy School of Government.
John had also just been appointed as chairman of the school's
Institute of Politics.
</P>
<P>
   But away from his magazine and public service duties, Kennedy, a
natural athlete, also pursued a number of challenging sports,
including kayaking, in-line skating, climbing and parasailing. He
received his pilots license just a little over a year ago, and he
was reportedly at the controls of the single-engine plane when it
went missing late Friday night with his wife, Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy, and her sister Lauren Bessette on board.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was rumored to be engaged to a number of women
during his early 30s, including actress Daryl Hannah, Kennedy met
Carolyn Bessette, a former Calvin Klein publicist, in 1993. After
nearly three years of on-again off-again dating, they married in
1996 at a small, secluded church on Cumberland Island, Ga.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A small plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife,
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister disappeared late Friday
off the Massachusetts coast, and by Saturday afternoon the
authorities had recovered debris from the airplane off Martha's
Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard said the debris included luggage with a business
card bearing the name of Lauren G. Bessette, 34, an investment
banker for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Kennedy's sister-in-law.
The suitcase and other debris were found on a beach about two miles
from the Martha's Vineyard estate once owned by Kennedy's mother,
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who was piloting the plane, was flying to the wedding
of a cousin, Rory Elizabeth Kennedy, the youngest daughter of Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy, in Hyannis Port, Mass. Ms. Kennedy was to be
married Saturday before 275 guests in a private ceremony. The
wedding was postponed indefinitely as Coast Guard cutters and
helicopters continued Saturday night to search for survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not ready to give up on this yet,'' said Rear Adm.
Richard M. Larrabee of the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   The single-engine plane, a Piper Saratoga owned by Kennedy, left
from Essex County Airport in Fairfield, N.J., at 8:38 p.m. on
Friday and was scheduled to land on Martha's Vineyard about 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration reported that the last
contact with the plane came at 9:39 p.m. when it was 17 miles
southwest of Martha's Vineyard, the Coast Guard said in a
statement. When the plane did not arrive, the Kennedy family
notified the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port Saturday, a white tent
stood by the sea, and a flag at full staff billowed in the breeze.
A Mass was said on the porch of the house of Rory's mother, Ethel
Kennedy, with about 50 family members and three priests praying
``for the safety of the loved ones, as well as for Rory'' and her
fiance, Mark Bailey, said a family spokesman, Brian O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 38, is the only surviving son of John F. Kennedy, the
35th president. He was born on Nov. 25, 1960, weeks after his
father's election and was known to the nation as ``John-John.''
</P>
<P>
   After his father's assassination, the enduring image from the
funeral came when Kennedy, then a little boy in a blue coat and
shorts, saluted his father's casket outside St. Matthew's Cathedral
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It was his third birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Given his celebrity and political pedigree, word of Kennedy's
disappearance touched off an extraordinary reaction, from the
corridors of the White House to the major networks, which broke
into their schedules for live reports from their anchors.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, spending the weekend at Camp David, was told
about the plane's disappearance shortly after 7 a.m. Saturday, the
White House said.
</P>
<P>
   The president called several members of the Kennedy family,
including Kennedy's sister, Caroline Kennedy; his uncle, Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Housing Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo,
husband of Kerry Kennedy, daughter of Robert F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our prayers and thoughts are with the families of those on
board,'' Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Cuomo, the former governor of New York and the father of
Cuomo, was among many whose response Saturday was shaped by the
Kennedy family's seemingly unending history of tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' said the former governor, ``there are just two
reactions that most people share: the almost inexplicable
concentration of tragedy, the reiteration of it in the Kennedy
family, which, perhaps because of their celebrity, seems almost
unique. And the second, more important impression is the way they
react to their tragedy over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not by becoming bitter and cursing the gods who did this
to them. It is by becoming more generous and turning to works of
commitment, especially for those people most in need.''
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the plane's disappearance remained a mystery
Saturday. Kennedy, who obtained his pilot's license last year, did
not file a flight plan and did not make radio contact with air
controllers during the flight, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, the initial search covered a broad swath of the
Eastern Seaboard, from Long Island to Cape Cod. About 3:30 a.m.
Saturday, the Coast Guard received a ``positive hit'' from an
emergency beacon off Long Island, but it proved to be unrelated to
the Kennedy airplane. Later Saturday morning, two boaters found
some debris floating off the Connecticut coast. That, too, was a
false alert.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Other agencies joined the search. The Air National Guard
dispatched a C-130 cargo plane. Fifteen planes from the Civil Air
Patrol were searching, too.
</P>
<P>
   New York Police Commissioner Howard Safir said the Police
Department, acting on a request from the Kennedy family early
Saturday, had dispatched officers to Kennedy's Manhattan apartment
to make sure he was not there.
</P>
<P>
   The family also asked the police to make sure Kennedy's car was
at Essex County Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The search continued along the presumed flight path of Kennedy's
plane, until the discovery of debris off Martha's Vineyard early
Saturday afternoon. That, combined with an analysis of radar data,
focused search efforts along a 17-mile expanse of water southwest
of Martha's Vineyard, where Kennedy had planned to drop off Lauren
Bessette before flying on to the wedding at the Kennedy compound.
</P>
<P>
   On Martha's Vineyard, law enforcement authorities quickly closed
off public access to the beach along Gay Head.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard officials refused to speculate on the fate of the
passengers, and they insisted they had not given up hope. But as
the day wore on, it became clear that hopes of finding survivors
were fading with each passing hour.
</P>
<P>
   Navy salvage experts were consulted. The oceanographic survey
ship, the Rude, was called in to use its sonar equipment to examine
the ocean floor, a rippled plain of fine sand which reaches depths
of up to 100 feet in the search area.
</P>
<P>
   Currents are moderate in the area and should not interfere with
searchers, said John Fish, the president of American Underwater
Search and Survey, a Massachusetts company that searches for sunken
airplanes around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety
Board, Ted Lopatkiewicz, said his agency, which investigates all
plane crashes, was standing by.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't know where to go at this stage,'' he said. The
agency got the report of an overdue plane at about 5 a.m., he said,
and sent investigators early Saturday to the airport in Fairfield
to gather records and speak to ground personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Bailey, 25, a merchandising analyst and a pilot from Cedar
Grove, N.J., who has flown from the Essex airport for 13 years,
said he saw Kennedy and his wife about 8 p.m. Friday as they walked
toward Kennedy's plane parked at the airport. Inside, a group of
teen-age girls caught sight of Kennedy and gushed about how they
could not believe he had a plane in Fairfield.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said he watched as Kennedy walked around the outside of
the plane and then went through a routine series of preflight
checks. One thing about Kennedy's preflight check struck Bailey as
odd. Usually pilots take their planes down the runway a bit to do
their engine ``rev-ups,'' to avoid creating too much noise in the
parking area. But he said Kennedy did his rev-ups in the parking
space.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impression I got was maybe there was something wrong with
the plane,'' Bailey said. ``It just caught my attention, like, `Why
is he doing this here?'''
</P>
<P>
   He said Kennedy's plane took off without incident, first heading
south before turning east and then northeast, toward Martha's
Vineyard. Bailey, who flew to Martha's Vineyard two weeks ago, said
the ocean route can be hazardous, especially at night.
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft like the Piper do not carry flight data recorders or
cockpit voice recorders, the ``black boxes'' that investigators use
to piece together the details of jet crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was flying under visual flight rules, meaning that the
pilot took responsibility for picking his route and avoiding other
traffic, rather than relying on air traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
   Though wind conditions were mild on Friday night, visibility in
the area was poor, pilots said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very hazy, and it was very dark, and it was very hard
to see the horizon,'' said Michael C. Bard, a private pilot, who
left Martha's Vineyard about 9:15 p.m. on Friday and flew back to
his home in Danbury, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not instrument rated, it could be difficult
maintaining the airplane in an upright condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Lorenzo, the owner of Caldwell Flight Academy, which
operates at the Essex airport, said he believed Kennedy was in the
process of getting his instrument license, which allows pilots to
fly in cloudy or bad weather, using only instruments.
</P>
<P>
   While his family roots run deep in Boston, Kennedy came of age _
personally and professionally _ in New York City. He grew up with
his mother on Fifth Avenue, and later moved to a loft in TriBeCa.
After graduating from New York University Law School in 1989, he
went to work for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Kennedy was the constant object of media
attention. He was crowned ``The Sexiest Man Alive,'' and
``America's Most Eligible Bachelor.'' The rise and fall of his
romance with the actress Daryl Hannah spilled across the front
pages of the tabloids. When he twice failed his bar examination,
that, too, was front-page news.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a minor miracle, then, that Kennedy managed to marry
Ms. Bessette in 1996 in near secrecy on a secluded island off
Georgia. A wispy, ethereal blond who had worked in public relations
for Calvin Klein, Ms. Bessette Kennedy was immediately anointed a
``symbol of American style,'' by Liz Tilberis, the editor in chief
of Harper's Bazaar. There seemed no limit to the public appetite
for gossip about the couple. Even a quarrel with his wife _
videotaped by a stranger _ was broadcast on television.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Kennedy seemed to have settled into his work as
editor of George, a flashy monthly magazine about politics that he
started in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy is that he was emerging as an individual _ making
his own way, which was not an easy thing for him to do,'' said
Ashton Hawkins, executive vice president of the Metropolitan Museum
of Art and a friend of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. ``He was
managing his life very well _ he was just at the moment where it
was taking shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bessette Kennedy, 33, is a year younger than her sister,
Lauren Bessette, who is a principal in the investment banking
division at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. A graduate of Hobart
College, Ms. Bessette joined the company about six years ago, and
was based in Hong Kong for several years. She has an identical
twin, Lisa.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother, Ann Freeman, a teacher and administrator, and
their stepfather, Dr. Richard Freeman, an orthopedic surgeon, live
in Connecticut. A woman who answered the telephone at their home
declined to comment Saturday. Their father, William Bessette, an
architectural engineer, did not return a telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   In Hyannis Port, a Kennedy wedding became a vigil. Christina
Rivers of Hyannis was to dress the hair of the bridal party before
attending the wedding as a guest. On Friday night, she designed
Rory's hair for the rehearsal dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just wonderful over there last night, just exciting,''
Ms. Rivers said. ``It's just not fair. I don't know what it is, but
it's not fair.''

 A CALL OF ALARM, THEN DEBRIS AND A GROWING SENSE OF DREAD  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER AND CARLOS MONTJE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The call came in to the Coast Guard station in Woods Hole about
2:15 a.m.: An airplane piloted by John F. Kennedy Jr., expected to
arrive on Martha's Vineyard just before 10 p.m., had not shown up.
</P>
<P>
   It took nearly an hour and a half longer before an initial
search was launched and the plane's disappearance officially noted.
</P>
<P>
   By dawn Saturday, hundreds of military and civilian rescuers had
begun to scan about 6,000 square miles of ocean and coastline from
Long Island to Martha's Vineyard, searching for clues to the
aircraft's location.
</P>
<P>
   At about 1:30 p.m., in the surf near Aquinnah, some clues were
found: a headrest, bits of carpet, an aircraft support with a wheel
attached, and a canvas bag with identification from Kennedy's
sister-in-law _ one of the passengers on board the Piper Saratoga
II HP.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Kennedy's plane, which took off from Essex County
Airport in Fairfield, N.J., had been missing for 15 1/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the debris, Coast Guard officials Saturday believed
that the airplane had ditched into the Atlantic, perhaps miles
short of the airport in West Tisbury, Mass. Saturday night, Kennedy
and his passengers, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her
sister, Lauren Bessette, were presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always hope but unfortunately when you find certain
pieces of evidence, you have to be prepared for anything that
happens,'' said Coast Guard Lieutenant Gary L. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The search, which included 20 helicopters, jets, and light
airplanes and several Coast Guard cutters and boats, was scheduled
to continue through the night, with sonar equipment brought in from
a nearby federal research agency.
</P>
<P>
   But without more wreckage or a signal from the plane's on-board
radio transponder, one officer said, trying to find the aircraft in
such a massive search field was frustrating. Kennedy also had not
filed a flight plan, a routine omission but one that may have
delayed the start of the rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we saw were waves breaking on rocks,'' said Greg Buonomo,
a Suffolk County, N.Y., police officer who flew a Bell 206
helicopter from Islip, N.Y. to participate in the search.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing out there,'' said his partner, Steve DeMeo.
``If there is a search, you hope to find something.''
</P>
<P>
   The long delay before the start of the search prompted some
pointed questions to Air Force officials at a Pentagon briefing
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieutenant Colonel Steve Roark said searchers had not
received a radio signal from the downed craft and decided to follow
procedure and wait for daylight before beginning aerial missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at possible other landing sites . . . rather than just
sending out aircraft willy-nilly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roark also said the amount of resources devoted to the search
was not influenced by Kennedy's celebrity status, as the son of
John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We treat all the searches the same,'' he said. ``There is no
difference between celebrity and noncelebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   The six-seat Piper Saratoga had left the New Jersey airport
about 8:30 p.m. Friday and was apparently tracked by FAA radar
officers as it approached the airport in West Tisbury until as late
as 9:39 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Flying conditions were considered marginal because of a haze
over the water, although visibility was about 3 miles and stars and
a crescent moon could be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kennedy was flying under what are known as ``visual
flight rules'' and was not in constant communication with the
airport tower. Controllers likely assumed the plane had landed
safely when it left the screen, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, officials only began to receive warnings after
around 2 a.m., they said, when family friends called in.
</P>
<P>
   The first search aircraft took off around 7:30 a.m., the Air
Force said. About 15 Civil Air Patrol planes were also dispatched,
focusing on areas along the coastline and inland areas near
Kennedy's presumed flight path.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, searchers focused on the coordinates of a brief, weak
radio emergency beacon, recorded around 2 a.m. off Mattituck, N.Y.
But that proved to be a false alarm, and by midmorning the search
had been expanded to include the entire length of the plane's
planned route from New Jersey up the coast.
</P>
<P>
   After searching for hours without results, a rare piece of hard
data turned up: a black canvas bag, floating in the surf near
Aquinnah shortly after noon. A group of friends sunbathing on the
beach spotted the luggage.
</P>
<P>
   The bag's ID tag contained a Morgan Stanley business card from
Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible sinking feeling,'' said Damon Seligson, 30,
a Boston lawyer who said he swam out to retrieve the luggage. ``I
felt my heart burst out of my chest; it was just terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The find helped direct searchers to areas much closer to
Martha's Vineyard; by evening, authorities said they had
concentrated on an area 17 miles southwest of the airport, where a
debris field had begun to surface.
</P>
<P>
   Another grim find came around 1:30 p.m. when a Coast Guard crew
working in a small boat near the coast of Aquinnah found pieces of
carpet and the headrest. Coast Guard Lieutenant Gary L. Jones said
the items were ``consistent with a plane crash.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones also said bits of identifiable luggage had been found, but
he would not give specifics.
</P>
<P>
   The wreckage was found less than a mile from the estate of
Kennedy's late mother, Jacqueline Kenn

GONZALEZ'S ALL-STAR ABSENCE A BIG NOTHING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What Juan Gonzalez should have done is miss a third of the
regular season with a mystery ailment, then show up for last week's
All-Star Game and play the full nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   A certain cornerback pulled a similar stunt but still had a
loving local media licking up to him.
</P>
<P>
   Or what Gonzalez could have done is accept an invite to Boston,
but then decline the All-Star spot due to personal business.
</P>
<P>
   A certain bullpen ace for Joe Torre's Yankees did exactly that.
Mariano Rivera's ``personal business?'' He went home to Panama to
check on the construction of a new house.
</P>
<P>
   Did anyone harpoon Rivera as a disgrace to the game for
insulting baseball fans of all ages? Did Torre, the All-Star
manager, question Rivera's motives as he did Juan's? Of course not.
</P>
<P>
   Based on what has happened the last couple of weeks, Gonzalez
might as well change his name to Casey Jones. He's been railroaded
in a national and local frenzy of criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Juan is being portrayed as the evil poster child for
everything that ails millionaire members of the jock kingdom. He
has been called a disgrace to the game and to the Rangers'
organization. But the disgrace is actually elsewhere. It rests in
the laps of those guilty of overreaction and overkill.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez didn't attempt to strangle Johnny Oates, or he didn't
flunk a drug test for the fourth time, or he didn't get drunked up
and slam his Mercedes into a concrete wall. Nor was there any ``why
don't you run the laps'' backtalk to a coach, and no cops were
knocking on a hotel-room door.
</P>
<P>
   This amounted to nothing more than Gonzalez saying he wasn't
going to last week's All-Star Game unless he was voted in as a
starter. Big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Should he have gone anyway? Sure. And if he wasn't going, could
Gonzalez have handled it a bit different? Sure.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't high crimes against humanity. Some ego obviously
became involved, and Juan maybe pushed himself out there on a
ledge. I don't know about you, but I happen to live on the same
ledge. Stuff happens. People get mad. I'm sorry if you're offended.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else, however, Gonzalez simply spoke the
truth on why he wasn't going to the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, the system was flawed. Cleveland fans went nuts on us,
voting in undeserving characters just because their ballcaps had
the insignia of a weird looking Native American, which hisses off
the Native Americans something fierce.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, in the strangest bit of scheduling in Rangers history, The
Ballpark in Arlington basically sat empty the entire month of June,
prime voting month for the All-Star Game. Local fans didn't get the
opportunity to ballot-box stuff, while the Indians lived at home in
June.
</P>
<P>
   The system was flawed.
</P>
<P>
   But speaking the truth turned Gonzalez into a human dartboard,
not only for media types but also many in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Juan did not deserve the trashing. No, he's never been Cal
Ripken or Sammy Sosa in creating positive P.R. for himself. But
Juan is an OK guy and the best player ever in Arlington and one of
the best in the game today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never said anything negative about the fans, other players,
or the manager,'' said Gonzalez. ``I did feel like, based on my
performance this season, and being the MVP from last season, I
deserved to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I understood what was happening with the voting system,
and how the schedule was unfair to the Rangers. And then I said
what I said because I believed strongly I was right.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be best now if Juan, looking back at his decision,
would retreat a bit and admit he was wrong. But he won't. I respect
him for that.
</P>
<P>
   In his original comments to T.R. Sullivan of this sports staff,
Gonzalez did note some personal displeasure about Joe Torre. Two
years ago, when Juan was also coming off an MVP season and also
putting up large numbers, Torre snubbed him and selected two
Yankees outfielders as All-Star reserves. Torre was wrong. Juan had
a right to still be miffed.
</P>
<P>
   But Juan quickly and wisely backed off any criticism of Torre.
Juan centered everything around the flawed system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have eyes and ears _ I read and hear what's been said about
me,'' noted Gonzalez. ``But I will stay strong. I believe what I
believe. People wonder about next season _ would I do the same
thing? But this was about this year. Every season is different.
Maybe I don't deserve to go next season, who knows.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the many media rip jobs on Gonzalez suggested he had
``embarrassed'' the Rangers with this ``controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   I laughed. Then I thought of Jerry Jones. Jerry is praying hard
the Cowboys' next embarrassment and controversy will be as big a
nothing as this whole affair.

CONGRESSMAN QUITS REPUBLICAN PARTY, BLAMING EXTREMISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., this story has been added to NYT Page 1, as 2X reefer,

 (HLW)  
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUOGUE, N.Y. _ Rep. Michael P. Forbes, a mercurial Republican
who has frequently butted heads with House Republican leaders,
announced Saturday that he was becoming a Democrat because his own
party had been captured by ``extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   He accused the Republican leadership of being ``tone deaf'' to
the concerns of average Americans on issues from health care to
education to the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Sweating profusely in the blistering sunshine during a news
conference outside his gray-shingled home, Forbes repeatedly
slammed his former party's leadership with the kind of harsh
oratory that Democrats once used against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``With no communist menace to rail against, and with an American
economy that is the strongest to be sustained in our lifetime, the
national Republican Party over the last four and a half years has
allowed itself to become defined through the actions of extremists
in the House of Representatives,'' said Forbes, who is in his third
term.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become angry, narrow-minded, intolerant, uncaring,
incapable of governing at all, much less from the center.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials said Forbes, 47, is the first congressional
Republican to switch to the Democratic Party in nearly a
quarter-century _ a period in which they said at least 10 Democrats
in Congress flipped to the Republican side.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who once did the unthinkable by voting against Newt
Gingrich, when Gingrich was running for re-election as speaker of
the House in 1997, has for years been an outcast in the Republican
Party, and his defection is not expected to draw other Republicans
into the Democratic fold.
</P>
<P>
   But the move still seems like an important psychological victory
for the Democrats as they seek to capture the House next year. With
Forbes' defection the Democrats now need to win just five
additional seats to be in the majority.
</P>
<P>
   `I really think you are seeing a party in a real state of
difficulty,'' Dick Gephardt, the House minority leader, said of the
Republicans. ``You may be seeing a realignment taking place.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans played down the significance of the move,
suggesting Forbes was a political loner who could be less than
stable in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael's decision to leave the resurgent Republican Party for
the minority party is, like many of his past actions, inconsistent
and erratic,'' said Rep. Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia, chairman
of the National Republican Congressional Committee. ``Last year, he
voted to impeach Democrat Bill Clinton. Last month he endorsed
George W. Bush for president and today, he chooses to side with the
party of higher taxes and bigger government.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the Republicans would do ``everything we can'' to
unseat Forbes next year. Among the names of challengers being
circulated in Republican circles are Suffolk County Executive
Robert J. Gaffney, New York Assemblyman Fred W. Thiele Jr. and
state Senator Kenneth P. LaValle.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who won re-election last year with 64 percent of the
vote, said he expected to be the target of Republican retribution
not just in next year's election but also in the House, where the
Republican leadership is likely to block his bills and strip him of
his seat on the powerful House Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Gephardt said he would ask Democrats on the Appropriations
Committee, which allocates federal funds, to step aside so that
Forbes can retain his seat. He also vowed to do ``everything I
can'' to get Forbes re-elected, though he said he could not promise
that there would not be a primary.
</P>
<P>
   At least one Democrat, Tony Bullock, chief of staff to New
York's senior Democratic senator, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, has said
that he might challenge Forbes in the primary. But Democratic
officials said Saturday that an effort was already under way by
party officials to urge Bullock to back off.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has told Democratic officials that he has not yet decided
whether to retract his endorsement of Bush of Texas, who is the
Republican front-runner in the polls. In his news conference
Saturday, the congressman was careful not to attack Bush directly.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore, who is seeking the Democratic nomination to
replace Clinton, issued a statement Saturday praising Forbes as a
man of ``principle and integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the symbolic importance of the defection, leaders
in both parties waged a tug-of-war for his heart and mind in recent
days.
</P>
<P>
   Since Thursday, when the rumors began spreading in Washington
that Forbes might defect, Davis, Alfonse D'Amato and Gov. George
Pataki have called Forbes and asked him to reconsider, Democratic
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is not easy to peg ideologically, and he will be somewhat
to the right of House Democrats. He supports Democratic initiatives
to expand federal spending on day care, to protect the environment,
to revamp campaign finance laws and to regulate health maintenance
organizations. But he also opposes abortion rights and often votes
against gun control.
</P>
<P>
   In an indication of the balancing act Forbes may now be forced
into, he was sharply questioned Saturday at his news conference by
an abortion rights advocate, an environmental advocate and a local
Republican leader.
</P>
<P>
   He said changing parties would not cause him to change his
positions on major issues.

ORIOLES TRY TO EMPTY NEST

<P>
   The Baltimore Orioles are the American League Dodgers, an $84
million roster that is poorly constructed and going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the Dodgers, they make no secret about wanting to
move players who have not given them a return on their investment.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles GM Frank Wren has initiated talks with almost a dozen
teams involving starting pitchers Scott Erickson and Juan Guzman,
reliever Arthur Rhodes and even outfielders Brady Anderson and
Albert Belle, both of whom carry leverage to veto deals.
</P>
<P>
   Contenders including the Cleveland Indians, Atlanta Braves, New
York Yankees, New York Mets and Texas Rangers used the All-Star
break to express strong interest in players who might help them
reach a World Series but are no longer considered part of the
Orioles future. Cleveland is big on Erickson and Texas is hot for
Guzman.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles, last in the AL East entering the weekend, do have a
list of untouchables: pitchers Mike Mussina, Sidney Ponson and
Jason Johnson; catcher Charles Johnson; third baseman Cal Ripken
and left fielder B.J. Surhoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not only looking short term but long term,'' Wren said.
``You can move them, but does it make you better? In some cases you
might be better today, but are you better in the future? Clubs have
interest in our guys. The question is how much each has to
offer.'' &QL; 
__ Bosox stars
</P>
<P>
   All-Star starter Nomar Garciaparra of the Boston Red Sox could
become only the second shortstop since Ernie Banks (1958) to lead
his league in slugging percentage, joining Milwaukee's Robin Yount
(1982). Yount also won MVP that year. . . . Pedro Martinez makes
his first start of the second half today, meaning he has fifteen
starts left if he pitches every fifth game. He would need to win
them all to finish with 30 victories. &QL; 
__ For his own good &QL; 
White Sox manager Jerry Manuel benched shortstop Mike Caruso for
the final game of the first half and is expected to give Craig
Wilson some extended playing time at short in the second half.
Caruso finished the first half in a 3-for-22 slump that dropped his
on-base percentage to .278, the lowest among AL hitters with enough
plate appearances to qualify for a batting title. Caruso's defense
has been even worse. He had five errors in the first 52 games but
has committed 11 in his last 26 starts. ``We're trying to put a
challenge out there for him,'' Manuel said. ``His job is basically
on the line in the second half. I'm just being honest with him.'' &QL; 
__ Hit man
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's Manny Ramirez, the major-league RBI leader with 96
in his first 78 games, has a shot to catch Hack Wilson, who holds
the record with 191. Ramirez averaged 1.23 RBI per game in the
first 78 games of the season. If he maintains that average in the
last 75 regular-season games, he would finish with 188. To break
Wilson's record, Ramirez must average 1.28 RBI per game in the
second half. That would give him 192. All that despite missing nine
games in the first half due to injury and suspensions. &QL; 
__ Tipoff time
</P>
<P>
   There is concern that Yankees right-hander Roger Clemens is
struggling in part because he is tipping his pitches to hitters. He
was roughed up by the Mets in his last start before the break and
came back Thursday to lose to Atlanta 6-2. More than one Met said
Clemens gave away his slider from the stretch position. He threw
104 pitches and only two were swung on and missed by Mets batters.
American League left-handed hitters seem to have figured him out,
too. They're batting .299 against Clemens, up 102 points from a
year ago. As a whole, the AL is batting a comfortable .2766 against
the five-time Cy Young Award winner. &QL;

LOOKING FOR BUSINESS DIVERSITY IN KANSAS CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER and MARY SANCHEZ  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- If one defines workplace diversity as taco
day in the company cafeteria, a sensitivity seminar for employees
or a line in a mission statement about respecting cultural
differences, then everything's up to date in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   But if a diverse company is one where management, board members
and suppliers mirror the racial makeup of the community, good
hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond cosmetic changes, the complexion of Kansas City's
business community remains overwhelmingly white, with few signs of
impending change.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks, Hispanics and Asians make up 19 percent of the total
population and 19 percent of the work force in the Kansas City
area. But they comprise just 9 percent of the managers and
professionals at area companies -- a statistic that lags national
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Of 277 directors at the 20 largest public companies and four of
the largest and best-known private firms in Kansas City, only nine
directors, or about 3 percent, are minorities. That is half the
national average.
</P>
<P>
   While most local companies profess a strong commitment to the
principles of diversity -- which extends to gender, disabilities,
sexual orientation and more -- few have specific programs to
recruit and retain minority executives, or to increase the amount
of business they do with minority-owned firms.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, ``when you look at where the large corporations stand,
you can be assured the small and medium-sized companies are not
addressing it,'' said Kirk P. Perucca, president/CEO of Project
Equality, which tracks employment practices at area companies.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder, then, that when Jesse Jackson came to Kansas
City last month, he dragged Sprint Corp. into the spotlight,
questioning why the area's largest private employer was not hiring
more minority contractors to work on its $1 billion corporate
campus in Overland Park, Kan., in suburban Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson was quick to note that the problem was not just
Sprint. ``Let's take a look at all of corporate Kansas City,'' he
said. ``Let's challenge them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many here say that challenge is long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in business for 30 years, and we still lack
credibility in our business here,'' said Kelvin Perry, president of
Newspaper Electronics Corp., a minority-owned company that sells
computer hardware to businesses. ``Go down a list of the top 50
businesses in Kansas City. We do no substantive business with those
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere. And I'm not
singing `New York, New York.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Perry and many others said that the lack of minority managers
and the dearth of minority-owned businesses in the area reflected
the racial attitudes ingrained in corporate culture, the ongoing
segregation and the lack of inclusiveness in the community at
large.
</P>
<P>
   More-charitable observers give credit to a few companies that
have attacked the issue head on, but fault the business community
at large for failing to address it in a meaningful way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas City is a polite town,'' said Colette Holt, an
affirmative-action lawyer. ``People here don't want to be
uncomfortable, and they don't want to make other people
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes it harder to talk about race.''
</P>
<P>
   Consultants acknowledge that progress in the inclusion of
minorities as top managers and suppliers is an evolutionary
process. It takes commitment from top management, sensitivity to
the complexities of race and a willingness to work around very real
hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   But they say it is possible, and ultimately profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the greatest potential here to make a difference,''
said Jim Abbott, executive director of the Minority Supplier
Council in Kansas City, a diversity liaison between minority and
majority businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the leadership here decides to take something on, it gets
done. I can't say that collectively they have taken on this
issue.''
Talking the talk
</P>
<P>
   Corporate attitudes about diversity span the spectrum. Some see
it as an opportunity, others as a problem that needs to be solved,
or even a nonissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't distinguish between minority and nonminority
suppliers,'' said Julie Bartels Smith, a spokeswoman for American
Century Investments. Nor, she said, does the company have a
minority hiring program.
</P>
<P>
   Many area companies express a variation on that theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is that there is no color,'' said Stephen Pope,
vice president of human resources at O'Reilly Automotive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally this was a white, male-dominated business,'' he
said, noting that there were few women or minorities. ``Over the
years we have brought those people into the company, and over time
and they have progressed quite nicely.''
</P>
<P>
   When contacted by The Kansas City Star, representatives of the
20 largest public companies in the region and four of the largest
private firms almost universally stated that their company embraced
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Some celebrate a specific diversity day. Commerce Bank has at
least two. When Western Resources had its annual diversity
celebration, Kansas Gov. Bill Graves issued a proclamation naming
Oct. 23 diversity day in the entire state.
</P>
<P>
   Few would criticize those efforts. But when it comes to formal
programs, with measurable goals that are benchmarked, tracked and
prioritized by senior management -- the kinds of programs that
experts say deliver results -- most companies have little to brag
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no diversity plan per se,'' said Mark Dirkes, senior
vice president of marketing at Interstate Bakeries. ``That doesn't
mean we aren't using minority suppliers. There's just no plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies may be able to diversify without a formal effort.
But not many, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a company sets real, meaningful goals, it tends to
work,'' said Abbott, of the Minority Supplier Council. ``If it's
just an ad hoc thing, the numbers aren't there.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, most companies' commitment to diversity depends on
whether they see a compelling business reason to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Diversity advocates say there is -- profits.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight percent of Americans are minorities today. By 2050,
half will be. That is an enormous pool of potential customers,
prospective employees and vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, experts insist, diverse work forces are better problem
solvers. They make it easier to recruit and retain staff, tap new
markets, design better products and provide first-class customer
service to a diverse customer base.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of approached diversity as the right thing to do,''
said Keith Kennedy, director of corporate diversity at Hallmark
Cards. ``But we have grown to the point that it is also a business
imperative for us.''
Parsing the talk
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how many local companies think diversity benefits
the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies approach recruiting and new markets with a
specific target. They go where they can generate numbers, period.
</P>
<P>
   Banks, for instance, go for neighborhoods and customers with big
loan volume and substantial account balances. Beyond regulatory
requirements, they see few compelling reasons to put branches in
minority neighborhoods, or chase the tiny loans and accounts that
they have found are typically generated there.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Sprint is pinning its future to an integrated voice
and data service that will cost more than $100 a month. It is
specifically aiming at high-value, technology-savvy consumers who
already use multiple phone lines and communications services. The
company isn't excluding minorities, but minorities make up a small
part of the target market for a key new product.
</P>
<P>
   Diversity also can be a tough sell to executives who were weaned
on conformity and resent outside advice on how to run their
businesses. Many see aggressive diversity initiatives in the same
light as affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Even when executives advocate diversity, the mention of specific
goals elicits concerns about quotas, or being forced to promote
less-qualified employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have avoided quotas, because that's opening another bag of
worms in terms of people feeling they're discriminated against
because they're not part of that group,'' said Lloyd Hill, chief
executive of Applebee's International.
</P>
<P>
   Middle managers and line employees also can take a cynical view
of the programs, particularly if they see senior management making
little effort to diversify itself, or using a diversity program as
a legal shield against discrimination complaints and lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees feel threatened. Others assume the changes will
be inefficient or unacceptable to shareholders, because they expect
increased costs and reduced profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to deal with the tradeoffs,'' said Tim Larson, vice
president of supply at H&AMP;R Block. ``Purchasing from a minority
business might mean paying a significant premium or getting lesser
quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Minority firms frequently do lack the capacity to ramp up a crew
and get a big job done quickly. They may lack adequate staff, cash
flow, bonding or insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities, however, say the issue of nonperformance is a
convenient excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very real misconception that using minority
suppliers will cost you more money and give you an inferior
performance,'' said Maurice Williams, coordinator of supplier
diversity at Kansas City Power &AMP; Light. ``You may not be able to
put your hands on it, but it's virtually everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   A. Marie Young, executive director of the Black Chamber of
Commerce, sees a common reaction when she introduces her members to
purchasing representatives at large businesses in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to shock me,'' she said. ``They don't even attempt to
hide their surprise that these black business leaders exist ...
that we have businesses with the capacity and experience that is
here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of awareness is only one aspect of what many describe as a
vicious circle in the development of minority businesses.
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, business always has been a matter of whom you
know. And minorities, by definition, are not part of the old-boys
network.
</P>
<P>
   Minority-owned firms say they often are ignored when companies
request bids from suppliers -- even when they've networked and made
formal presentations to the same companies' purchasers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feed who they know,'' said Elbert Harris, owner of
Courtney Day Inc., a local construction contractor. ``If I don't
have access, I don't have opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Without new opportunities, it is difficult for small firms to
grow, build equity and get the financing they need to increase
capacity and take on successively larger jobs. And businesses that
do not grow often die.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a few restaurants and funeral homes, relatively few
local minority businesses have endured from one generation to the
next, which bolsters the perception that they are ill-managed and
lack expertise.
</P>
<P>
   It also means the incentive is diminished for young minorities
to return to Kansas City after college. Many don't see compelling
opportunities in the minority business community, competitive
salaries at large companies or enough neighborhoods where upwardly
mobile minorities are comfortable living.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got multiple offers and you can go anywhere, and
you've got that kind of potential to grow, why would you come to
Kansas City?'' asked Young, of the Black Chamber.
Walking the talk
</P>
<P>
   What separates token diversity programs from effective ones,
experts say, are those that identify potential barriers up front
and work around them.
</P>
<P>
   On the supply side, some companies restructure their payment
schedules on contracts to help small contractors cover payroll and
equipment leases. Others break large jobs into smaller chunks that
small companies can digest.
</P>
<P>
   Last year area lenders refused to grant one of KCP&AMP;L's
streetlight contractors a line of credit to handle working capital
-- even when KCP&AMP;L offered to guarantee 75 percent of the loan. So
the company paid the contractor out of its own pocket and then
collected from the city once the work was approved.
</P>
<P>
   KCP&AMP;L has three programs designed to further develop its
vendors' businesses. Adopt-A-Vendor, for instance, offers vendors a
12-week evaluation of their financing, management, technical
expertise and marketing, and a comprehensive action plan for
developing the business.
</P>
<P>
   KCP&AMP;L tracks its annual expenditures with minority businesses,
and has a specific goal each year to increase them. Moreover, the
purchasing department is held accountable for those goals at annual
review time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of the things we've been able to do,'' Williams
said. ``But we've got a long, long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' statement is typical of the companies that are
furthest along the diversity curve. They acknowledge that there is
a problem.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank has taken pains to address diversity issues in
Kansas City, creating a local diversity action council with 45
officers. The group focuses on taking specific measures in four
areas: recruiting and retention; promotion and career development;
education; and community involvement.
</P>
<P>
   This summer the company hired 16 interns in the Midwest. Eleven
are minorities. This year in Kansas City it paired 25 promising
minority professionals in a formal mentoring relationship with
officers who are senior vice presidents and above. The company
tracks how many times the pairs meet each month. And each pair
issues regular progress reports.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank's overall corporate goal this year is to direct 15
percent of the company's total procurement dollars to minority- and
women-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark has been setting concrete spending goals with minority
vendors for 30 years. In 1969 the amount was $25,000. This year it
is about $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company stays in touch with employees who have left, hoping
to one day woo them back. There are mentoring programs, a program
to help employees chart their career paths and support groups for
racial groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better for us to talk to our employees about their future
rather than to let some headhunter tell them,'' said Hallmark's
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark is in the third year of a five-year program to increase
the number of minorities and women in senior management. And hiring
and retention of minority and women employees has been made one of
the key priorities senior managers are expected to meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't make people accountable for it, is it really a
business imperative?'' Kennedy asked.

LOOKING FOR BUSINESS DIVERSITY IN KANSAS CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER and MARY SANCHEZ  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- If one defines workplace diversity as taco
day in the company cafeteria, a sensitivity seminar for employees
or a line in a mission statement about respecting cultural
differences, then everything's up to date in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   But if a diverse company is one where management, board members
and suppliers mirror the racial makeup of the community, good
hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond cosmetic changes, the complexion of Kansas City's
business community remains overwhelmingly white, with few signs of
impending change.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks, Hispanics and Asians make up 19 percent of the total
population and 19 percent of the work force in the Kansas City
area. But they comprise just 9 percent of the managers and
professionals at area companies -- a statistic that lags national
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Of 277 directors at the 20 largest public companies and four of
the largest and best-known private firms in Kansas City, only nine
directors, or about 3 percent, are minorities. That is half the
national average.
</P>
<P>
   While most local companies profess a strong commitment to the
principles of diversity -- which extends to gender, disabilities,
sexual orientation and more -- few have specific programs to
recruit and retain minority executives, or to increase the amount
of business they do with minority-owned firms.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, ``when you look at where the large corporations stand,
you can be assured the small and medium-sized companies are not
addressing it,'' said Kirk P. Perucca, president/CEO of Project
Equality, which tracks employment practices at area companies.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder, then, that when Jesse Jackson came to Kansas
City last month, he dragged Sprint Corp. into the spotlight,
questioning why the area's largest private employer was not hiring
more minority contractors to work on its $1 billion corporate
campus in Overland Park, Kan., in suburban Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson was quick to note that the problem was not just
Sprint. ``Let's take a look at all of corporate Kansas City,'' he
said. ``Let's challenge them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many here say that challenge is long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in business for 30 years, and we still lack
credibility in our business here,'' said Kelvin Perry, president of
Newspaper Electronics Corp., a minority-owned company that sells
computer hardware to businesses. ``Go down a list of the top 50
businesses in Kansas City. We do no substantive business with those
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere. And I'm not
singing `New York, New York.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Perry and many others said that the lack of minority managers
and the dearth of minority-owned businesses in the area reflected
the racial attitudes ingrained in corporate culture, the ongoing
segregation and the lack of inclusiveness in the community at
large.
</P>
<P>
   More-charitable observers give credit to a few companies that
have attacked the issue head on, but fault the business community
at large for failing to address it in a meaningful way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas City is a polite town,'' said Colette Holt, an
affirmative-action lawyer. ``People here don't want to be
uncomfortable, and they don't want to make other people
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes it harder to talk about race.''
</P>
<P>
   Consultants acknowledge that progress in the inclusion of
minorities as top managers and suppliers is an evolutionary
process. It takes commitment from top management, sensitivity to
the complexities of race and a willingness to work around very real
hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   But they say it is possible, and ultimately profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the greatest potential here to make a difference,''
said Jim Abbott, executive director of the Minority Supplier
Council in Kansas City, a diversity liaison between minority and
majority businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the leadership here decides to take something on, it gets
done. I can't say that collectively they have taken on this
issue.''
Talking the talk
</P>
<P>
   Corporate attitudes about diversity span the spectrum. Some see
it as an opportunity, others as a problem that needs to be solved,
or even a nonissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't distinguish between minority and nonminority
suppliers,'' said Julie Bartels Smith, a spokeswoman for American
Century Investments. Nor, she said, does the company have a
minority hiring program.
</P>
<P>
   Many area companies express a variation on that theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is that there is no color,'' said Stephen Pope,
vice president of human resources at O'Reilly Automotive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally this was a white, male-dominated business,'' he
said, noting that there were few women or minorities. ``Over the
years we have brought those people into the company, and over time
and they have progressed quite nicely.''
</P>
<P>
   When contacted by The Kansas City Star, representatives of the
20 largest public companies in the region and four of the largest
private firms almost universally stated that their company embraced
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Some celebrate a specific diversity day. Commerce Bank has at
least two. When Western Resources had its annual diversity
celebration, Kansas Gov. Bill Graves issued a proclamation naming
Oct. 23 diversity day in the entire state.
</P>
<P>
   Few would criticize those efforts. But when it comes to formal
programs, with measurable goals that are benchmarked, tracked and
prioritized by senior management -- the kinds of programs that
experts say deliver results -- most companies have little to brag
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no diversity plan per se,'' said Mark Dirkes, senior
vice president of marketing at Interstate Bakeries. ``That doesn't
mean we aren't using minority suppliers. There's just no plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies may be able to diversify without a formal effort.
But not many, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a company sets real, meaningful goals, it tends to
work,'' said Abbott, of the Minority Supplier Council. ``If it's
just an ad hoc thing, the numbers aren't there.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, most companies' commitment to diversity depends on
whether they see a compelling business reason to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Diversity advocates say there is -- profits.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight percent of Americans are minorities today. By 2050,
half will be. That is an enormous pool of potential customers,
prospective employees and vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, experts insist, diverse work forces are better problem
solvers. They make it easier to recruit and retain staff, tap new
markets, design better products and provide first-class customer
service to a diverse customer base.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of approached diversity as the right thing to do,''
said Keith Kennedy, director of corporate diversity at Hallmark
Cards. ``But we have grown to the point that it is also a business
imperative for us.''
Parsing the talk
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how many local companies think diversity benefits
the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies approach recruiting and new markets with a
specific target. They go where they can generate numbers, period.
</P>
<P>
   Banks, for instance, go for neighborhoods and customers with big
loan volume and substantial account balances. Beyond regulatory
requirements, they see few compelling reasons to put branches in
minority neighborhoods, or chase the tiny loans and accounts that
they have found are typically generated there.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Sprint is pinning its future to an integrated voice
and data service that will cost more than $100 a month. It is
specifically aiming at high-value, technology-savvy consumers who
already use multiple phone lines and communications services. The
company isn't excluding minorities, but minorities make up a small
part of the target market for a key new product.
</P>
<P>
   Diversity also can be a tough sell to executives who were weaned
on conformity and resent outside advice on how to run their
businesses. Many see aggressive diversity initiatives in the same
light as affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Even when executives advocate diversity, the mention of specific
goals elicits concerns about quotas, or being forced to promote
less-qualified employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have avoided quotas, because that's opening another bag of
worms in terms of people feeling they're discriminated against
because they're not part of that group,'' said Lloyd Hill, chief
executive of Applebee's International.
</P>
<P>
   Middle managers and line employees also can take a cynical view
of the programs, particularly if they see senior management making
little effort to diversify itself, or using a diversity program as
a legal shield against discrimination complaints and lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees feel threatened. Others assume the changes will
be inefficient or unacceptable to shareholders, because they expect
increased costs and reduced profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to deal with the tradeoffs,'' said Tim Larson, vice
president of supply at H&AMP;R Block. ``Purchasing from a minority
business might mean paying a significant premium or getting lesser
quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Minority firms frequently do lack the capacity to ramp up a crew
and get a big job done quickly. They may lack adequate staff, cash
flow, bonding or insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities, however, say the issue of nonperformance is a
convenient excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very real misconception that using minority
suppliers will cost you more money and give you an inferior
performance,'' said Maurice Williams, coordinator of supplier
diversity at Kansas City Power &AMP; Light. ``You may not be able to
put your hands on it, but it's virtually everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   A. Marie Young, executive director of the Black Chamber of
Commerce, sees a common reaction when she introduces her members to
purchasing representatives at large businesses in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to shock me,'' she said. ``They don't even attempt to
hide their surprise that these black business leaders exist ...
that we have businesses with the capacity and experience that is
here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of awareness is only one aspect of what many describe as a
vicious circle in the development of minority businesses.
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, business always has been a matter of whom you
know. And minorities, by definition, are not part of the old-boys
network.
</P>
<P>
   Minority-owned firms say they often are ignored when companies
request bids from suppliers -- even when they've networked and made
formal presentations to the same companies' purchasers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feed who they know,'' said Elbert Harris, owner of
Courtney Day Inc., a local construction contractor. ``If I don't
have access, I don't have opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Without new opportunities, it is difficult for small firms to
grow, build equity and get the financing they need to increase
capacity and take on successively larger jobs. And businesses that
do not grow often die.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a few restaurants and funeral homes, relatively few
local minority businesses have endured from one generation to the
next, which bolsters the perception that they are ill-managed and
lack expertise.
</P>
<P>
   It also means the incentive is diminished for young minorities
to return to Kansas City after college. Many don't see compelling
opportunities in the minority business community, competitive
salaries at large companies or enough neighborhoods where upwardly
mobile minorities are comfortable living.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got multiple offers and you can go anywhere, and
you've got that kind of potential to grow, why would you come to
Kansas City?'' asked Young, of the Black Chamber.
Walking the talk
</P>
<P>
   What separates token diversity programs from effective ones,
experts say, are those that identify potential barriers up front
and work around them.
</P>
<P>
   On the supply side, some companies restructure their payment
schedules on contracts to help small contractors cover payroll and
equipment leases. Others break large jobs into smaller chunks that
small companies can digest.
</P>
<P>
   Last year area lenders refused to grant one of KCP&AMP;L's
streetlight contractors a line of credit to handle working capital
-- even when KCP&AMP;L offered to guarantee 75 percent of the loan. So
the company paid the contractor out of its own pocket and then
collected from the city once the work was approved.
</P>
<P>
   KCP&AMP;L has three programs designed to further develop its
vendors' businesses. Adopt-A-Vendor, for instance, offers vendors a
12-week evaluation of their financing, management, technical
expertise and marketing, and a comprehensive action plan for
developing the business.
</P>
<P>
   KCP&AMP;L tracks its annual expenditures with minority businesses,
and has a specific goal each year to increase them. Moreover, the
purchasing department is held accountable for those goals at annual
review time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of the things we've been able to do,'' Williams
said. ``But we've got a long, long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' statement is typical of the companies that are
furthest along the diversity curve. They acknowledge that there is
a problem.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank has taken pains to address diversity issues in
Kansas City, creating a local diversity action council with 45
officers. The group focuses on taking specific measures in four
areas: recruiting and retention; promotion and career development;
education; and community involvement.
</P>
<P>
   This summer the company hired 16 interns in the Midwest. Eleven
are minorities. This year in Kansas City it paired 25 promising
minority professionals in a formal mentoring relationship with
officers who are senior vice presidents and above. The company
tracks how many times the pairs meet each month. And each pair
issues regular progress reports.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank's overall corporate goal this year is to direct 15
percent of the company's total procurement dollars to minority- and
women-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark has been setting concrete spending goals with minority
vendors for 30 years. In 1969 the amount was $25,000. This year it
is about $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company stays in touch with employees who have left, hoping
to one day woo them back. There are mentoring programs, a program
to help employees chart their career paths and support groups for
racial groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better for us to talk to our employees about their future
rather than to let some headhunter tell them,'' said Hallmark's
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark is in the third year of a five-year program to increase
the number of minorities and women in senior management. And hiring
and retention of minority and women employees has been made one of
the key priorities senior managers are expected to meet.

TOWN UNWAVERING IN ITS DEVOTION TO ANNUAL FESTIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAVERLY, Kan. -- Starting at 6 p.m. last Monday, the first of
what would grow to about 2,000 men, women and children began
filling the downtown of this Coffey County community.
</P>
<P>
   The grown-ups toted lawn chairs; the smaller kids, eyes wide
with anticipation, clutched paper and plastic bags. Everybody
waited.
</P>
<P>
   For what?
</P>
<P>
   Why, a parade.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 p.m. the annual Ohio Days procession began rolling south
down Pearson Avenue -- 35 entries, 13 floats, Shriners doing stunts
on their all-terrain three-wheelers, Miss Flint Hills, politicians,
horses with riders, dogs, National Guard vehicles, a Pepsi-Cola
truck, Boy Scouts, the American Legion marching, an 1880s fire
wagon, older kids on bicycles swirling here and there, even an
antique manure spreader.
</P>
<P>
   And that was just part of the parade, which was part of Ohio
Days, a three-day event that for more than a century has riveted
this town in midsummer.
</P>
<P>
   From almost every passing vehicle came a shower of candy, a
tradition akin to the throwing of beads during New Orleans's Mardi
Gras. The little kids with their bags scurried to claim the booty.
Their parents, sitting in the lawn chairs, kept a sharp eye.
</P>
<P>
   The parade took 45 minutes to pass the farm trailer/announcing
stand. Not bad for a town of 600-plus, well off Interstate 35, as
yet untouched by franchisees and long ago abandoned by the Santa Fe
railway.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief moment on a pleasant July evening, Waverly turned
itself into a slice of Americana now mostly relegated to old
photographs and newsreels -- flags, costumes, friends waving at
friends, and children retrieving Tootsie Rolls from the cracks of a
classic brick main street. With minor changes in clothing and
motive power, what took place here Monday could have happened in
1910, 1940 or 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't change,'' said Kenneth L. Combes, an insurance man
who is on the Ohio Days steering committee. ``We just do it year
after year pretty much the same. It gets to be a habit. But then
people here don't want that much change.''
</P>
<P>
   The parade ended at the city park, but not before every float,
every entry, every bike and vehicle went past the Sunset Manor
nursing home, where residents could look out the windows or come
out, some with walkers, some in wheelchairs.
</P>
<P>
   At the city park there was a stage show. And, of course, there
were the carnival and rides provided by the Ottaway Amusement Co.
of Wichita, which has been coming to Waverly just about as long as
anybody can remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best parade ever,'' one middle-age woman said afterward. At
her age, though, she couldn't really know. The Ohio Days parade is
103 years old. It is thought to be the oldest continual celebration
of its kind west of the Mississippi River, said Irene Combes,
Kenneth Combes' wife.
</P>
<P>
   The story goes that in 1896 a group of Waverly residents -- all
settlers from Ohio -- decided to have a picnic south and west of
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted shade, and in those days that was the only grove
of trees around,'' said Opal Kunkel, 84, who's deep into the
history of Waverly.
</P>
<P>
   From the very first, Kunkel said, the people referred to the
celebration as Ohio Days, a time for reminiscing about the Buckeye
State. Kansas had blistering heat in the summer, strange storms
then called cyclones, grasshoppers, blizzards and land that
hereabouts -- because of thin topsoil -- was overly susceptible to
droughts.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Coffey County wasn't as barren as western Kansas. But it
wasn't -- by any stretch -- Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Kunkel said, Ohio Days outgrew the picnic in the
grove and was moved to town. There always have been church
services, she said. And a parade, entertainment, and even something
as hokey as a baby show.
</P>
<P>
   The oddity about Ohio Days, said Kunkel and the Combes, is that
it has never missed a beat. Rather than fade away as so many
celebrations have in so many small towns, it endured, the only
change over the years being a change of dates from August back to
July.
</P>
<P>
   The Depression and Dust Bowl days, when lots of people didn't
have two nickels to rub together? Ohio Days went on.
</P>
<P>
   The World Wars, when the young men were gone, gas and tires were
rationed, and bad news came by Western Union? Ohio Days survived
those, too.
</P>
<P>
   Or the long twilight of small-town Kansas, where high school
graduating classes seemed to disappear almost overnight as they
left for bigger places? Ohio Days persisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all my days, I can't remember anybody even suggesting we
cut back,'' Kunkel said. ``It's just something that's here, that
everybody gets involved in. It's our heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Combes says he thinks that's part of the secret. Fully
20 percent of the population here has some sort of job to do in
relation to the celebration -- floats, the barbecue, games, the
talent contest and a legion of other tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The other part of the secret, Combes said, is that Waverly has
never commercialized Ohio Days and tried to make it an ``event,''
something he knows the tourism people in Topeka would dearly love.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a lot of pressure from the media for advertising,'' he
said. ``You know, put it in the paper, publicize it on the radio.
And we get vendors calling, wanting to come in and set up booths.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the hard sell to tourists -- all the rage now as
rural Kansas tries to diversify its economy away from the old
mainstays of livestock and crops -- Waverly puts out a simple
flier, black print on white paper. That's the extent of publicity
for Ohio Days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at our entertainment,'' Combes said. ``All local. Oh, we
could get a big-name act, bring people in from Topeka or Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or we could bring in vendors from outside and their booths.
But that's not what this is all about. Pretty soon it would all be
different. It wouldn't be Ohio Days.''
</P>
<P>
   Happily, said Irene Combes, young people are moving back to
Waverly, primarily those who went away after high school but who
want to return to their roots and raise their children in a bucolic
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're getting new blood,'' she said. ``And they're getting
involved. And one of these days, they'll be running Ohio Days.
Simple.''

<HEADLINE>
MOVING DAY -- ONE OF MANY -- IS FINALLY HERE FOR SPRINT CORP. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK P. COUCH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The great migration has started.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint Corp. this weekend is rolling out the moving trucks and
beginning a three-year shuffle of 14,500 workers that eventually
will gather the company's scattered masses on its $920 million
corporate campus in Overland Park, Kan., in suburban Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five workers in Missouri's tallest office tower in
downtown Kansas City will be the first Sprint employees to move
into Kansas' largest office park headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campus comes to life this weekend,'' said Philippe Dordai
of The Hillier Group of Princeton, N.J., the lead architect on the
project. ``Until now, it's all been bricks and mortar. Now with
people in it, that's when it starts to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, the fourth truckload of chairs, boxes and
office equipment was delivered to the first building to open on the
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Two moving specialists in a conference room tracked deliveries
while several movers hauled the equipment into the building. About
45 persons worked on this weekend's moving crew.
</P>
<P>
   The movers tracked their progress with red check marks on lists
taped to the conference room window. Moving trucks were dispatched
with walkie-talkies as unloading crews hustled cartloads of items
into the building.
</P>
<P>
   The move was calculated with military precision. Trucks are
scheduled to arrive every half hour. Computer gurus prowl the
cubicles to connect the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, this mission will be accomplished. But the crew has
hundreds of similar missions over the next three years before the
job is down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like the marathon, as opposed to the sprint,'' said
Patricia Henriques, president of Management Alternatives Inc., a
Washington moving consultant that has worked with the Pentagon on a
huge renovation of its offices.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, 75 Sprint employees will report to the campus
for the first day of work at a site that's still largely a
construction zone.
</P>
<P>
   That's when already crowded roads and restaurants around the
campus at 119th Street and Nall Avenue will begin the Sprint test.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, the telecommunications company will move
3,500 workers to the campus, spokeswoman Laura Meyer said. The
company expects to haul 10,000 pieces of computer equipment and
35,000 boxes in 500 truckloads for those workers.
</P>
<P>
   The first 75 workers will occupy half a floor, or about 40,000
square feet, in the only campus building near completion. That's
about 1 percent of office space in the Sprint campus.
</P>
<P>
   The entire first building will be completed in three weeks, said
Daniel Euston, project manager for J.E. Dunn Construction Co., the
general contractor.
</P>
<P>
   The Sprint workers will be separated from construction in
progress by barriers, Euston said.
</P>
<P>
   When completed, the 200-acre campus will have 18 office
buildings, 16 parking garages, restaurants, a fitness center, a
child-care center, a 1.7-mile jogging trail and a 3,000-seat
amphitheater.
</P>
<P>
   The Sprint workers moving this weekend are part of a unit that
sells long-distance service to businesses, said Margaret Latshaw, a
Sprint group manager overseeing the move.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint will move an average of 200 workers to the campus each
weekend through October, Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The first group was selected because Sprint's lease in One
Kansas City Place at 1200 Main St. expires soon, Latshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the early moves are dictated by lease issues, Latshaw
said. Sprint now occupies more than 40 leased buildings throughout
the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint Chief Executive Officer William T. Esrey probably won't
move to the campus until 2001, Meyer said. Sprint owns its
headquarters building in Westwood, and the company is focusing on
moving workers out of leased properties in the first round of
moves.
</P>
<P>
   By early next year, the moves will bring together divisions that
originally were separated to comply with federal rules prohibiting
greater cooperation, Latshaw said. Under current laws, the
divisions -- long-distance and local service -- can work more
closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will really be an enabler to get groups to interact in a
way they haven't been able to,'' Latshaw said. ``We now have the
opportunity to bring those walls down.'
</P>
<P>
   While Sprint is knocking down walls between departments, some
Sprint employees are knocking on doors to buy houses near the
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Larson, an agent with J.C. Nichols Residential, said the
influx of homebuyers into Johnson County was pushing up prices and
causing houses to sell quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to pinpoint whether it's all Sprint, but our market
is booming,'' Larson said. ``There have been a lot of Sprint
employees who have opted to move closer.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Sprint moves in, some residents are moving out.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Meyer, who lives a few blocks from the campus, said her
family was moving this month to a new house a few miles away to
avoid the traffic congestion she expects the 14,500 Sprint workers
to cause in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roads haven't been prepared,'' said Meyer, who isn't
related to Sprint spokeswoman Laura Meyer. ``I feel like this
development thing is just out of control and that people don't
realize the impact to individuals. It's great for the community
because of the new jobs. But it impacts our quality of life, and I
felt like we had to give up our house. That's not replaceable.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Stuecheli, senior transportation planner for Overland Park,
said widening Nall Avenue from four to six lanes between Interstate
435 and 119th Street would help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a top-priority project to get done, and it's something
we're pushing for,'' Stuecheli said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal freeze on road expansion projects, however, is a
stumbling block for the Nall project, because officials don't know
whether they can proceed with construction. The project was
supposed be completed by late 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In May the U.S. Department of Transportation ruled that the
area's transportation plans did not meet federal clean-air
requirements. The ruling halted new highway expansion projects and
could affect the Nall plan, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody is worried about increased traffic. Nearby
retailers are already seeking ways to attract Sprint employees.
</P>
<P>
   A sign on the Firestone Tire and Service Center at 7050 W. 115th
St. invites Sprint workers to pick up their free employee-discount
card.
</P>
<P>
   Ty Brown, manager of tire sales at Firestone, said the store had
given away 4,000 discount cards since the store opened in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprint employees are an economic force for our business,''
Brown said. He estimated that more than half of the store's
customers were Sprint employees.

 &HT;    KENNEDY CLAN WAITS AND PRAYS AS SEARCH CONTINUES
 &HT;    Eds: Updates in grafs 5-6 with visual search suspended.
 &HT;    With KENNEDY-TOWN.
 &HT;    By BOB DART and JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HYANNIS PORT, Mass. _ Members of the Kennedy family gathered at
their summer home here Saturday to pray and await word from a
massive search for a missing airplane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr.,
his wife and sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   A piece of luggage and what appeared to be airplane parts,
dragged from the surf by beachgoers on the western tip of the
nearby island of Martha's Vineyard, appeared to be grim and
undeniable confirmation that Kennedy's single-engine Piper Saratoga
plane had crashed into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old son of former President Kennedy was reported
missing early Saturday on a flight from Essex County Airport in
Fairfield, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Also aboard the plane, which Kennedy was piloting, were his
wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and Lauren Bessette, her elder
sister, according to officials and a family spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you miraculous stories of people surviving,'' said
Rear Admiral Richard M. Larrabee of the U.S. Coast Guard. ``We're
not ready to give up on this yet.''
</P>
<P>
   As darkness fell over the Eastern Seaboard, Massachusetts state
police said visual searching was suspended for the night. However,
an Air National Guard helicopter with infrared sensors arrived on
the scene and planned to continue searching in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee said a National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration
research vessel equipped with sonar was also to arrive in the
search area Saturday night and begin scanning the ocean floor for
the missing aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   John and Carolyn Kennedy were on their way here to attend the
wedding of his cousin, Rory Kennedy, youngest daughter of the late
Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, who like his brother the president was
assassinated in the 1960s. The wedding was postponed.
</P>
<P>
   The mood inside the Kennedy compound here was somber but
hopeful, said Brian O'Connor, a family spokesman. He said three
Catholic priests were present and that a mass was held for family
members Saturday morning on the porch of the home of Ethel Kennedy,
Robert Kennedy's widow.
</P>
<P>
   Guards and barricades kept hordes of tourists and reporters
about a block away from the white houses topped with weathered gray
shingles that have served as a resort and a refuge for the extended
Kennedy family for more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the compound, an American flag flew at full mast as an
expression of hope.
</P>
<P>
   The compound had served as a family's _ and a nation's _ focal
point for tragedy in the past, and fears grew that yet more sadness
awaited the country's most prominent political clan.
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee said his service and the Federal Aviation
Administration began searching for the aircraft shortly after
midnight when members of the Kennedy family said the plane had not
arrived at an expected landing on Martha's Vineyard Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   However, actual visual search of the area could not begin until
shortly after daylight Saturday and did not focus on the waters
near Martha's Vineyard until after the luggage and debris confirmed
to be from the plane were spotted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a debris field that really is the center of our
search, but we're searching an area probably from Woods Hole (on
the coast of the Massachusetts mainland) south about 10 to 15 miles
south of Martha's Vineyard,'' Larrabee said at a news conference in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who recently obtained his private pilot's license, was
flying under conditions that other pilots said could be treacherous
_ haze that made it hard to distinguish land from water.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was not trained in instrument-assisted flying procedures
and would have been forced to rely on his visual perception of the
terrain as he approached Martha's Vineyard in the 300-horsepower,
six-passenger aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy plane took off from the Fairfield airport at 8:30
p.m. EDT Friday and was due to land on Martha's Vineyard at 10:30,
according to the Coast Guard. Kennedy had not filed a flight plan,
and none was expected for that kind of trip, according to the
Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee said FAA records indicated radar had tracked Kennedy's
plane as far as Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   He reportedly had planned to drop off Miss Bessette at Martha's
Vineyard before proceeding on with his wife to Hyannis Port.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a self-described love of privacy not unlike that of his
mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, John Kennedy Jr. had been in
the nation's limelight for most of his life.
</P>
<P>
   He became an enduring symbol of national grief when, as a
3-year-old toddler known as ``John-John,'' he was caught by
television cameras saluting the flag-draped coffin of his father,
the slain president.
</P>
<P>
   When he failed the New York bar examination, dated movie stars,
worked in a New York district attorney's office and got married, it
was always in front of the news media.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, People Magazine proclaimed him the ``sexiest man
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Only his Sept. 21, 1996 wedding, in the seclusion of Georgia's
Cumberland Island, was private.
</P>
<P>
   Although often mentioned as a potential political candidate who
might carry on the legacy of his father and uncles, Robert and
Edward, he chose journalism instead and founded George magazine,
which blended politics and celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was receiving reports on the search at his
weekend retreat at Camp David, according to the White House press
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our prayers and thoughts are with the families of those on
board,'' press secretary Joe Lockhart said in a statement.

SORROW ONCE MORE: TRAGEDY STRIKES FAMILY ALL TOO USED TO IT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A child of tragedy may have become a victim himself.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of John F. Kennedy Jr. is just the latest
shock in more than 50 years of sorrow for one of the nation's most
prominent families.
</P>
<P>
   As a toddler, the picture of his snappy salute before the coffin
of his father, the slain president, was etched into the national
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Over recent years, even with his high media profile and magazine
editor's job, he seemed to be one of the more normal of the Kennedy
cousins _ a brood known as much for public scandal as public
service. JFK Jr. was even moved a few years ago to write that two
cousins, one of whom had an affair with the baby sitter and another
who badgered his wife into a divorce, were ``poster boys for bad
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, JFK Jr.'s disappearance on a plane he was piloting, and
which carried his wife and her sister, raises anew the question of
a star-crossed family _ and of the ``Kennedy curse.'' That sense
may be heightened by the timing _ the fact that Sunday is the 30th
anniversary of the car accident at Chappaquiddick Island, Mass., in
which Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., swam to safety but a woman
in the car, Mary Jo Kopechne, drowned.
</P>
<P>
   In part, talk of a ``Kennedy curse'' stems from an idea that
patriarch Joseph Kennedy Sr.'s overweening political ambition _
first for himself and then for a succession of sons _ has visited a
heritage of horrors on his offspring.
</P>
<P>
   The debate inevitably becomes ideological as much as emotional.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal commentators focus on the string of tragedies striking a
family that has provided a president, two senators and a host of
other politicians and activists who have risen above their
privileged station to champion the downtrodden. Conservative
analysts see a myth perpetuated by what one called a
``Camelot-clinging'' media.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a curse on the Kennedy's, it's pretty much a
self-inflicted wound,'' David Horowitz, author of ``The Kennedys _
An American Drama,'' told television interviewers in 1998 after
cousin Michael Kennedy died in Aspen, Colo. He slammed into a tree
during a game of football on skis.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kennedy's death emphasized the sometimes reckless, macho
side of the family's exploits _ especially among its men. But it
also revealed an intense bond. An eyewitness to the skiing accident
said sister Rory gave Michael mouth-to-mouth resuscitation,
spitting his blood onto the snow. JFK Jr. was en route to Rory's
wedding when his plane disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a clan, and it is tight-knit,'' Horowitz said in the
television interview. ``And it has an almost paranoid stance
against the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy family has a history of heroics and hedonism that
stretches back before World War II, when Joseph Sr. was ambassador
to Britain. He wanted to be the United States' first Roman Catholic
president, but those hopes were dashed not only by religious
intolerance but also by his urging too much caution in the fight
against Hitler and by a longtime and well-known extramarital affair
with actress Gloria Swanson.
</P>
<P>
   He transferred his political aspirations to son Joe Jr., but at
29 the handsome heir was killed as he flew a military mission in
war-torn Europe. Four years later, daughter Kathleen, the adored
``Kick'' who had married into British nobility, also died in an air
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Sr. quickly refocused his electoral hopes on his second
son, John F. Kennedy, and financed his campaigns for the U.S. House
and Senate from Massachusetts. In 1960, the patriarch's dream was
realized, as JFK narrowly won the White House.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been a charmed administration, but it was also
brushed with sorrow, when in the summer of 1963, son Patrick
Bouvier Kennedy was born premature to first lady Jacqueline Kennedy
and soon died.
</P>
<P>
   Then, 1,000 days into his presidency _ on Nov. 22, 1963 _
Kennedy was assassinated, at age 46, as he rode in an open
limousine through downtown Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   For the family, as well as much of the nation, it was
unbelievable, something more from a Wagnerian plot than history
itself.
</P>
<P>
   By 1968, Joseph Sr.'s third son, Robert F. Kennedy, was seeking
the presidency _ in protest against President Lyndon B. Johnson's
war in southeast Asia and in search of his family's disrupted
legacy. As he left the stage after claiming victory in the
California Democratic primary, RFK, at 43, was gunned down by an
Arab fanatic. His wife, Ethel S. Kennedy, was pregnant with Rory.
</P>
<P>
   What had been tragic for the family would soon become surreal.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1969, as man was landing on the moon, the
fourth Kennedy son, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, drove off a bridge at
Chappaquiddick, the incident in which Kopechne was killed.
</P>
<P>
   The death and the senator's murky explanations of the events
effectively ended any prospect he would make it to the White House,
although he sought the nomination in 1980 against the incumbent
Democrat, President Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the line of tragedy and scandal shifted to the next
generation of Kennedys, especially RFK's children. In 1973, Joseph
Kennedy III was the driver in an accident that left a woman
passenger paralyzed for life. In 1984, his brother, David, was
found dead of a heroin overdose in a Florida hotel, after he had
been kicked out of the family's Palm Beach estate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, a night of partying at the family's seaside compound
resulted in rape charges against another cousin, William Kennedy
Smith. He was acquitted, but testimony at his trial included
details of Sen. Ted Kennedy wandering about in his underwear while
the younger generation sought sex with locals.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Michael Kennedy's death, he was implicated in a
sexual affair with the family baby sitter. At about the same time,
his brother, Rep. Joseph Kennedy III, D-Mass., was getting a Roman
Catholic annulment so he could remarry.
</P>
<P>
   As in the Chappaquiddick incident, the more recent cases raised
questions about whether the Kennedys receive special treatment, in
these cases from the law and the church.
</P>
<P>
   Although Michael's baby sitter was a teen-ager, and he could
have faced statutory rape charges, he did not because the girl and
her family would not press charges or cooperate fully in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Joe's annulment, the archdiocese of Boston had to
come up with some canonical reason to allow dissolution of a
marriage that was long enough and intimate enough it had produced
twin boys.
</P>
<P>
   Joe's ex-wife, Sheila Rauch Kennedy, responded with a book,
Shattered Faith, in which she alleges he treated her like a
``nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the controversy and his defense of Michael, Joe scrapped
his plan to run for governor of Massachusetts and also did not seek
re-election to the House. At the same time, new accounts emerged of
JFK's extramarital sexual escapades while president, which included
a liaison with a Mafia moll.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the troubled swirl that made up the lives of some of his
cousins, JFK Jr., even with all his glamor and media attention,
seemed extraordinarily sound and sane.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent magazine article, RFK son Christopher said about a
third of his cousins were regulars at Alcoholics Anonymous, ``and
clearly a number of them have spent time in rehabilitation clinics
around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big family,'' Joe has said. ``There are always going to
be a few little problems along the way.''

<P>
   BOSTON -- John F. Kennedy Jr., who crawled out from under his
father's Oval Office desk into a life of tragedy-tinged celebrity,
was presumed dead Saturday along with his wife and her sister when
the small plane he was piloting apparently crashed off Martha's
Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Hope that the glamorous and free-spirited member of the nation's
most chronicled political family had simply made an unscheduled
landing dimmed when wreckage and luggage were found off Philbin's
Beach at the westernmost end of the island. A short walk down the
beach is the Vineyard home that Kennedy and his sister inherited
from their mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   As darkness fell, no bodies had been found, and an intensive
search involving the Coast Guard, Air Force, Air National Guard,
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Civil Air Patrol,
and scores of private vessels continued into the night.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said it was too early to speculate on the cause of
the crash, but preliminary efforts are focusing on Kennedy's
becoming disoriented because of poor visibility and losing control
of the plane, fuel mismanagement, or loss of control after doing a
flyby of the family property.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 38, a onetime Manhattan prosecutor who left the law to
become publisher of George magazine, was accompanied by his wife,
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her older sister, Lauren Bessette.
They were aboard his single-engine Piper Saratoga II HP, a plane
the novice pilot had purchased just 10 weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and his wife planned to drop off her sister on Martha's
Vineyard, then head to Hyannis for the wedding of a cousin, Rory
Kennedy, daughter of the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy. The
wedding scheduled for Saturday was postponed, and plans for a
celebratory Mass were replaced by the familiar and familial sound
of mournful prayers.
</P>
<P>
   The entourage had set out about 8:30 p.m. Friday from Essex
County Airport in Fairfield, N.J., and was expected to land at
Martha's Vineyard Airport by 10 p.m. Kennedy was not required to
file a flight plan, and had not done so.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who received his solo pilot license last year, took off
into a hazy sky from the New Jersey airport, and some pilots
questioned whether he was experienced enough to fly under such
conditions. Kennedy was not certified to fly solely via
instruments, and would have had to rely on visual cues.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Bailey, an experienced private pilot who also had planned
to fly from New Jersey to Martha's Vineyard Friday night, changed
his mind when he saw the sky. ``I felt it was too hazy and I didn't
want to chance it over open water,'' said Bailey, who said he saw
the Kennedy group at the airport, with Kennedy arriving in a white
convertible and wearing a backward baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said he noticed Kennedy was limping around the plane
during his preflight check; Kennedy had hurt himself several weeks
ago in a paragliding accident. Kennedy arrived at the airport
around 8 p.m.; his wife arrived shortly after and they left without
delay.
</P>
<P>
   Once airborne, Kennedy made no voice contact with the Martha's
Vineyard Airport, but his six-seat, red-and-white plane was last
spotted on the island airport's radar at 9:39 p.m. on what appeared
to be a final approach to the landing strip.
</P>
<P>
   A review of radar records showed the plane was 17 miles
west/southwest of the airport at an altitude of 2,200 feet. On the
next radar pass, 12 seconds later, the plane had dropped to 1,300
feet. Twelve seconds later, the plane was nowhere to be seen,
sources with the Federal Aviation Administration said.
</P>
<P>
   The precipitous drop in altitude apparently did not trigger
action by flight controllers because, without a flight plan and
without voice contact, they had no reason to pay the aircraft any
heed and might not have even noticed the drop, according to FAA
officials and authorities on flight procedures.
</P>
<P>
   While family and friends held vigil at the Kennedys' Hyannis
Port compound, the feared death of the man known to the world as
``John-John'' added a sad new chapter to a family history in which
glory and sorrow alternate like day and night.
</P>
<P>
   The victories have come mainly from voters and wise investments,
while the losses have come from even more capricious sources,
including assassins, drugs, and the trees of Aspen. Even before
Friday's apparent plane crash, the family has suffered the fate of
Icarus before: Kennedy's uncle, Navy Lieutenant Joseph P. Kennedy
Jr., died in 1944 when his bomber exploded over England; his aunt,
Kathleen (Kennedy) Harrington, was killed in 1948 when the plane
she was aboard crashed in the mountains of France.
</P>
<P>
   Fears about John F. Kennedy Jr., his 33-year-old wife, and her
sister began in earnest sometime after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:15 a.m., a friend of the Kennedys called the Coast Guard
station in Woods Hole to say Kennedy and Bessette were late. Woods
Hole called the Coast Guard's Boston station, which in turn called
the FAA. The FAA and Air Force then began calling other airports to
see if the plane had landed somewhere else or perhaps never took
off.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, a satellite picked up an emergency beacon
signal off Montauk, N.Y. No immediate action was taken because it
is standard procedure to wait for additional beacon ``hits'' to
pinpoint the location of a downed airplane, said Coast Guard Petty
Officer Todd Burgun in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   After a second beacon signal was received, a ``case'' was opened
at 3:28 a.m. by the Air Force's Air Rescue Coordination Center,
which oversees searches for missing aircraft. However, it was not
known whether the signal had come from Kennedy's plane because the
beacon did not have a ``signature'' to indicate its source.
</P>

   At 4:30 a.m., a 41-foot Coast Guard utility vessel began
searching the area off Montauk, followed by another utility boat
and several larger vessels in the predawn hours. They found
nothing. At dawn, the Civil Air Patrol of the Air Force joined the
search with 15 single-engine planes, focusing almost exclusively
along the Long Island coastline.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the sky were two Coast Guard H60 Jayhawk helicopters, a
Coast Guard Falcon jet, and a huge C-130 from the Air National
Guard, which provided in-flight air traffic control of the search
planes. The same plane was involved in the aftermath of the crash
of TWA flight 800, which plunged into nearby waters three years ago
to the day.

 BOSTON: ... to the day.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For nearly 10 hours, the search focused on a nearly
1,000-square-mile area between the two airports, though much of it
was focused around Montauk, Coast Guard officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether a rescue effort might have been more effective if
begun sooner, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Steve Roark said: ``I
don't think so, because it was nighttime, and because of our
standard search procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how long the search would continue, Coast Guard commander
Mike Lapinski said: ``A lot of things come into play. The Coast
Guard is searching for survivors, and any indications there might
have been a chance of getting out and surviving and potentially
being in the water would lead them to continue. The more signs
there are, the longer we search.''
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Rear Admiral Richard Larrabee said Kennedy's
celebrity status had no bearing on the intensity of the search.
``Our efforts are consistent with the way we would search for
anyone who was lost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 1 p.m., the search shifted almost exclusively to
the waters off Martha's Vineyard when beachgoers found items linked
to Kennedy's plane.
</P>
<P>
   Erin McCarthy, 31, of Boston, was sitting on the beach with her
friends when she spotted something in the water. Thinking it might
be debris from the crash, her friend Damon Seligson, 30, a Boston
lawyer, swam out to get it.
</P>
<P>
   It was a black canvas bag packed with clothes, a bathing suit,
cosmetics, and a hair dryer. The bag had an ID tag with Lauren
Bessette's business cards from Morgan Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible sinking feeling,'' said Seligson. ``I felt
my heart burst out of my chest. It was just terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Campbell, 34, a private pilot from Greenwich, Conn., said
he saw the nose wheel and a part called a ``wheel pant'' from a
single-engine plane washed up on the beach. A short time later,
searchers turned up a headrest and part of a plane support called a
strut, said Coast Guard Lieutenant Craig Jaramillo.
</P>
<P>
   The plane Kennedy was flying was built in June 1995. He
purchased it used from Minir Hussain, a 39-year-old native of
Pakistan who runs a furniture factory in New Jersey. Hussain sold
it through a broker and said he believed Kennedy paid about
$300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hussain said he was at the Essex County Airport on Friday night
and noticed the plane was out of its hangar. He said he immediately
became worried when he was told Kennedy was going to be flying on
his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a risky situation for him to be flying without an
instructor because he was not instrument-rated to fly on his own,''
Hussain said in a telephone interview. ``I know that John was a
very good pilot. Everyone knew that. But I immediately began to
worry because the conditions were not that good.''
</P>
<P>
   Hussain said he had just landed his own plane at the airport and
believed that the visibility was not ideal, around 6 miles. While
it was still clear enough to take off without instruments, he felt
that it was ``too risky'' for someone without instrument
certification to do so.
</P>
<P>
   An FAA source said Kennedy had completed just 46 hours of flight
time.
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking federal transportation offical said the National
Transportation Safety Board had pulled the maintenance records of
the plane and found it to be well cared for.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently Kennedy did not fill his tanks prior to departure,
but fuel records obtained by the safety board indicate there were
at least 90 gallons on board, plenty of fuel for a single-engine
plane to make that trip. However, the plane has two fuel tanks, one
in each wing, and a pilot must remember to switch from one to the
other before fuel runs out.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the proximity of the wreckage to Jacqueline Onassis'
former Vineyard home, the official speculated that Kennedy may have
been ``buzzing'' the property that he and his sister now own and
was caught in a thermal updraft by the Gay Head cliffs.
</P>
<P>
   A thermal updraft would cause the plane to rise suddenly, and
the normal response of the pilot would be to push the yoke down to
lower the nose. Once the plane cleared the updraft, the plane could
suddenly dive. At low altitudes, such a move could be catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't count the number of times I have seen low-time pilots,
with family or friends on board, showing off by buzzing their house
and get into trouble,'' the source said. ``It is a mistake many
low-time pilots make.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane itself was not considered particularly difficult to
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The handling characteristics are very benign,'' said Warrent
Morningstar, director of media relations for the Aircraft Owners
and Pilots Association, a general aviation lobbying group. ``It is
not the sort of plane you would want to learn to fly in, but it
should not be a handful for a low-time pilot who had proper
training in the aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls began flooding into the Kennedy compound around 7
a.m. Saturday. President Clinton, who was spending the weekend at
Camp David, learned of the disappearance from his chief of staff,
John Podesta, and telephoned Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Andrew
Cuomo, the head of Housing and Urban Development, who is married to
Kerry Kennedy, a daughter of RFK.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called JFK Jr.'s sister, Caroline Kennedy
Schlossberg, who was reportedly on vacation out West. She was
expected to join the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our prayers and thoughts are with the families of those on
board,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's disappearance came one day before the 30th
anniversary of the day Edward Kennedy's car went off a dirt road at
Chappaquiddick, killing passenger Mary Jo Kopechne on the tiny
island adjacent to Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in May 1998, three weeks after he received his
pilot's license, Kennedy told USA Today that none of his relatives
could be persuaded to fly with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only person I've been able to get to go up with me, who
looks forward to it as much as I do, is my wife,'' he said.
``Whenever we want to get away, we can just get in a plane and fly
off.''

A CALL OF ALARM, THEN DEBRIS AND A GROWING SENSE OF DREAD 
</HEADLINE>
 LEDE-BOS  
 (Resending to restore dropped material)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER AND CARLOS MONTJE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The call came in to the Coast Guard station in Woods Hole about
2:15 a.m.: An airplane piloted by John F. Kennedy Jr., expected to
arrive on Martha's Vineyard just before 10 p.m., had not shown up.
</P>
<P>
   It took nearly an hour and a half longer before an initial
search was launched and the plane's disappearance officially noted.
</P>
<P>
   By dawn Saturday, hundreds of military and civilian rescuers had
begun to scan about 6,000 square miles of ocean and coastline from
Long Island to Martha's Vineyard, searching for clues to the
aircraft's location.
</P>
<P>
   At about 1:30 p.m., in the surf near Aquinnah, some clues were
found: a headrest, bits of carpet, an aircraft support with a wheel
attached, and a canvas bag with identification from Kennedy's
sister-in-law _ one of the passengers on board the Piper Saratoga
II HP.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Kennedy's plane, which took off from Essex County
Airport in Fairfield, N.J., had been missing for 15 1/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the debris, Coast Guard officials Saturday believed
that the airplane had ditched into the Atlantic, perhaps miles
short of the airport in West Tisbury, Mass. Saturday night, Kennedy
and his passengers, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her
sister, Lauren Bessette, were presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always hope but unfortunately when you find certain
pieces of evidence, you have to be prepared for anything that
happens,'' said Coast Guard Lieutenant Gary L. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The search, which included 20 helicopters, jets, and light
airplanes and several Coast Guard cutters and boats, was scheduled
to continue through the night, with sonar equipment brought in from
a nearby federal research agency.
</P>
<P>
   But without more wreckage or a signal from the plane's on-board
radio transponder, one officer said, trying to find the aircraft in
such a massive search field was frustrating. Kennedy also had not
filed a flight plan, a routine omission but one that may have
delayed the start of the rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we saw were waves breaking on rocks,'' said Greg Buonomo,
a Suffolk County, N.Y., police officer who flew a Bell 206
helicopter from Islip, N.Y. to participate in the search.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing out there,'' said his partner, Steve DeMeo.
``If there is a search, you hope to find something.''
</P>
<P>
   The long delay before the start of the search prompted some
pointed questions to Air Force officials at a Pentagon briefing
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieutenant Colonel Steve Roark said searchers had not
received a radio signal from the downed craft and decided to follow
procedure and wait for daylight before beginning aerial missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at possible other landing sites . . . rather than just
sending out aircraft willy-nilly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roark also said the amount of resources devoted to the search
was not influenced by Kennedy's celebrity status, as the son of
John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We treat all the searches the same,'' he said. ``There is no
difference between celebrity and noncelebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   The six-seat Piper Saratoga had left the New Jersey airport
about 8:30 p.m. Friday and was apparently tracked by FAA radar
officers as it approached the airport in West Tisbury until as late
as 9:39 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Flying conditions were considered marginal because of a haze
over the water, although visibility was about 3 miles and stars and
a crescent moon could be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kennedy was flying under what are known as ``visual
flight rules'' and was not in constant communication with the
airport tower. Controllers likely assumed the plane had landed
safely when it left the screen, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, officials only began to receive warnings after
around 2 a.m., they said, when family friends called in.
</P>
<P>
   The first search aircraft took off around 7:30 a.m., the Air
Force said. About 15 Civil Air Patrol planes were also dispatched,
focusing on areas along the coastline and inland areas near
Kennedy's presumed flight path.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, searchers focused on the coordinates of a brief, weak
radio emergency beacon, recorded around 2 a.m. off Mattituck, N.Y.
But that proved to be a false alarm, and by midmorning the search
had been expanded to include the entire length of the plane's
planned route from New Jersey up the coast.
</P>
<P>
   After searching for hours without results, a rare piece of hard
data turned up: a black canvas bag, floating in the surf near
Aquinnah shortly after noon. A group of friends sunbathing on the
beach spotted the luggage.
</P>
<P>
   The bag's ID tag contained a Morgan Stanley business card from
Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible sinking feeling,'' said Damon Seligson, 30,
a Boston lawyer who said he swam out to retrieve the luggage. ``I
felt my heart burst out of my chest; it was just terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The find helped direct searchers to areas much closer to
Martha's Vineyard; by evening, authorities said they had
concentrated on an area 17 miles southwest of the airport, where a
debris field had begun to surface.
</P>
<P>
   Another grim find came around 1:30 p.m. when a Coast Guard crew
working in a small boat near the coast of Aquinnah found pieces of
carpet and the headrest. Coast Guard Lieutenant Gary L. Jones said
the items were ``consistent with a plane crash.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones also said bits of identifiable luggage had been found, but
he would not give specifics.
</P>
<P>
   The wreckage was found less than a mile from the estate of
Kennedy's late mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, on a point of
land near Philbin Beach.
</P>
<P>
   On the island, police used four-wheel all-terrain vehicles and
an inflatable boat to comb beaches and inland areas, and cleared
beachgoers from Philbin Beach and surrounding areas to aid the
search.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the apparent accident, few complained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty sad,'' said Dailyn Higgins. ``It's the kind of
tragedy that this family always seems to be cursed with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel terrible for the family,'' said another
beachgoer, Lauren Belafonte, a sales representative at Stuff At
Night magazine who remembers seeing Carolyn Bessette while a
student at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   Satuday night, officials planned to begin using a sonar device
used to scan for submerged objects in the ocean. The advanced radar
system was on its way from a National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Administration facility in New York.
</P>
<P>
   At sunset, helicopters hovered over an area about 2 miles off
Aquinnah, scanning the waters.

WILL BRUINS PAY PRICE IF KHRISTICH REMAINS 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ So, Dmitri Khristich has filed for arbitration again.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong, it's his right as defined by the collective
bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   He's a Group 2 (restricted) free agent and the Bruins made him
the requisite qualifying offer of 10 percent over his $1.95 million
salary to protect their rights to him.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins had their way, they would've traded Khristich a
long time ago. Around the time of the entry draft in Boston at the
end of last month, the club talked to other teams in an effort to
pull off a deal. It was unsuccessful. Too bad. It's only going to
get harder from this point, especially if Khristich pockets a $3
million award from an arbitrator at his hearing next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to a lot of clubs,'' president/general manager Harry
Sinden said then. ``But they look at Khristich the way we do. He's
a good player who can score 25-30 goals but when you need him, is
he going to be there? We'd like to keep him. He's been here two
years and the longer he stays, I think the more he'll feel some
loyalty to the team. He drives (coach Pat Burns) nuts. To be a
talent like that and then be invisible some nights. It's
frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad the Bruins couldn't get the Rangers, who signed away Tim
Taylor and have been throwing money around like it's nothing, to
bite on a deal for Khristich.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years, Khristich has scored 29 goals. That's
great and all, but for the final quarter of the season and the
entire playoffs, Khristich was flat-out awful. He played with as
much intensity as a game of shinny on a New Hampshire pond during a
mid-morning in January. An empty sweater would have been just as
effective.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to second-guess the Bruins' stranglehold on the purse
strings, their decision to not lock up Taylor long before free
agency was even an issue, and a multitude of other things. However,
on the subject of Khristich, it's impossible not to share
management's frustration.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the season, Sinden teed off on center Jason
Allison and Khristich's performances in the second round against
Buffalo. Sinden mitigated his comments a day later on Allison,
saying he didn't get much help with Khristich as a linemate, but
reinforced his comments that Khristich was a bitter disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants all this money because he gets a few goals that are
meaningless, really,'' said Sinden after Boston was eliminated by
the Sabres. ``Meaningless goals. I need him in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The big question is will they endure Khristich's inconsistency
for a third season? The team has the option to walk away from the
award Khristich receives if it decides it doesn't want to pay it,
making him an unrestricted free agent. The downside of that,
however, is they will have lost him for nothing. It's not as if the
Bruins have 29-goal scorers just hanging around, waiting to take
Khristich's place.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't you love to be a fly on the wall for that hearing?
Sinden, armed with a case of videotapes defying the arbitrator to
find Khristich in any of the games against the Sabres; Khristich
relying on the numbers to justify his demands.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have the better case, not that it always matters, and
in the near future, could have a tough decision to make.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you want to find out where and when Bruins goalie Byron Dafoe
will be in your area this offseason, the netminder has an updated
web site that lists his personal appearances as well as other
pertinent information. To access it, go to
www.geocities.com/colosseum/stands/7752 . . . The world became a
poorer place last week with the passing of Philadelphia broadcaster
Gene Hart. Hart had an enthusiastic love of his sport and equal
enthusiasm for life. He was always quick with a greeting, a smile,
and a colorful story. He will be missed . . . It's possible that
former Bruins goalie Bill Ranford, who did two stints in Boston,
could be headed back to Edmonton for his second stint with the
Oilers, with whom he won a Stanley Cup in 1990. Since leaving
Edmonton, his career has been a real mixed bag. After almost nine
seasons in Edmonton, Ranford has been on four teams in four years.
After parts of two seasons with the Bruins, Ranford was traded to
Washington. From there, he was traded to dreadful Tampa Bay and
then to Detroit. The Red Wings bought him out at the end of the
season. ``He's only 32 years old and I'm sure he can recapture his
form,'' said Oilers president/general manager Glen Sather. If he
does, it's likely to be as a backup to probable No. 1 netminder
Tommy Salo. Ranford made nearly $3.1 million last season. If he
signs with Edmonton, the pay day will be, well, less. ``A lot
less,'' said Sather. If there's hope for locking up a backup,
Sather said he was thrown a strong curveball by his No. 1 goalie.
Sather said Salo and his agent, Rich Winter, had an understanding
about not going to arbitration and Sather said he was stunned when
Winter and Salo filed for a hearing. ``I didn't have a written
agreement but I had a verbal agreement,'' Sather said. ``I don't
think it's right that you give somebody your word and go back on
it, but that's his choice.'' Not surprisingly, Winter had a
different version. ``There appears to be a disagreement, a
misunderstanding, or a lack of consensus on the understanding that
preceded the trade (from the Islanders),'' said Winter. ``Tommy and
I made it clear to Glen we will be available to discuss that.
Hopefully, those discussions will lead to an arrangement.'' The
miscommunication or posturing or whatever between management and
goalie isn't the only story coming out of Edmonton. There is a
strong rumor floating that the club is trying to shop center Doug
Weight, who is coming off a serious knee injury. Sather vehemently
denies it. It already has been a long, hot summer for Sather, who
has 15 free agents to sign, with several heavy hitters among them,
including Bill Guerin, Roman Hamrlik, and Mike Grier. With a team
on a tight budget, the Oilers could make several deals before camp.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Sad to see yet another player forced into retirement because of
a concussion problem. The latest is big defenseman Jeff Beukeboom,
who bid farewell to the Rangers at the age of 34. Beukeboom
absorbed significant blows to the head in November when hit by the
Kings' Matt Johnson, was hit again in December, and had another
concussion Feb. 12 in a game against the Carolina Hurricanes. He
still has headaches and has trouble concentrating. ``My situation
over five months, the symptoms have not subsided,'' said Beukeboom,
who won four Stanley Cups in his career. ``It's never an easy
decision to walk away but it's easier to walk away because of
medical problems. I believe physically I could still compete. I
know medically the risk I would put my family in. My body is
healthy. My mind is not healthy right now.'' Maybe it's not
realistic to think this but for heaven's sake, we can send a man to
the moon but we can't come up with a helmet design to protect
people's heads from concussions? There has to be an answer out
there . . . Former Bruins goalie and all-around good guy Craig
Billington has changed addresses again. After three years as a
backup to Patrick Roy in Colorado, the 32-year-old Billington was
dealt to the Washington Capitals for future considerations. He is
slotted to back up Olaf Kolzig . . . Carolina general manager Jim
Rutherford has a real dilemma _ how to honor the late Steve
Chiasson. By all accounts, Chiasson was a wonderful person, great
family man, and first-class teammate. That's how the Hurricanes and
his family want to remember him. The tough part is coming to terms
with the circumstances under which Chiasson died May 3. He was
legally drunk when he rolled his pickup truck over in the wee hours
on the night the Bruins eliminated Carolina from the first round of
the playoffs. ``It is very important to us that we do remember him
and recognize him properly but the question is how to do that,''
said Rutherford. ``We're dealing with some issues when we talk
about this.'' Rutherford said the club has consulted those who deal
with the league's alcohol and substance abuse programs in an effort
to honor Chiasson properly . . . Perhaps carrying the weight of all
those Dallas Stars fans took its toll after all. Whatever the
cause, Stars coach Ken Hitchcock had to endure surgery to repair a
softball-sized hernia. The 47-year-old was supposed to go home to
Edmonton for a golf tournament, with the Stanley Cup in tow, when
the medical procedure intervened, forcing him to remain at his home
in Dallas. ``It was a full-blown hernia and it was awfully big,''
said Hitchcock. ``I'm motoring around like a normal human being and
getting better every day. I'll be fine.'' . . . Only 48 days to
training camp. The real question is will Dafoe be there?

   LONDON _ The Southwood beauty salon in North London was full
Saturday, as it is on most Saturday afternoons. But Saturday was
different, because at the top of each hour, the stylists paused,
holding their scissors aloft, the assistants at the sinks turned
off the water, and those getting their hair done craned their necks
to hear the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``A light aircraft carrying the son of the assassinated
president John F. Kennedy has been reported missing,'' a BBC
announcer intoned.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the chairs, Maggie Smith's mouth fell open and she
covered it with a cupped hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God,'' she said, almost in a whisper, ``that family is
cursed.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's reaction, delivered as dye soaked into her hair,
captured international reaction to the news that John F. Kennedy
Jr.'s plane was missing.
</P>
<P>
   How, people all over the world asked, could so many bad things
happen to one family? It is a question that will be asked over and
over again because, in Europe especially, this is the only story
that will matter in the coming days and weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturdays, the Southwood salon is usually a cacophony of
conversation, as the stylists and their customers trade gossip.
Saturday, it was somber and subdued and people spoke about the
missing plane in hushed tones.
</P>
<P>
   For Jean Draper, a hairstylist at Southwood, the news was
crushing. A native of Ireland, Draper said the Kennedys occupy a
special place in the land of their forebears.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard the news I was shocked,'' said Draper.
``But the more I thought about it, it's gotten to the point where
nothing surprises me about the Kennedys. They have tragedy after
tragedy, and it never seems to end. I don't know how they handle
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Alderson, a native of Scotland, shook his head as he
contemplated the news. The British royal family has had its share
of failed marriages, and this country came to a standstill after
Diana, Princess of Wales died in a car crash in Paris two years
ago. But compared with the Kennedys, the Windsors have been
remarkably free of lethal tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it about that family?'' Alderson asked. ``Every time
this happens, I ask myself the same question. What is it about that
family?''
</P>
<P>
   The story topped French TV news, and Italian state TV also led
with the story, using the 1963 photo of ``John-John'' saluting his
father's coffin. Israel and Russia also played the story
prominently.
</P>
<P>
   For the tabloid press, especially in Britain, the story is
manna. This is what Europeans call the silly season, when the
absence of real news, most of it politically driven, leads
newspapers to drum up stories to fill a void that runs from
mid-July until September.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the British tabloids are right-wing and relish
rubbishing the Kennedys. The word ``curse'' was being fit Saturday
night into many tabloid headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Rupert Murdoch's Sky News network devoted most of its coverage
Saturday to the search for the Kennedy plane. A strip across the
bottom of the screen reminded viewers of the ``Kennedy Curse'' and
of how US Senator Edward M. Kennedy was charged with drunken
driving after Mary Jo Kopechne died three decades ago in a car he
was driving on Martha's Vineyard, the destination of the missing
Kennedy plane.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1980s, when Ted Kennedy forced Murdoch to comply
with a Federal Communications Commission edict forbidding the
ownership of newspapers and television stations in the same area,
Murdoch papers have taken aim at the Kennedy family.
</P>
<P>
   But while the tabloids have begun a feeding frenzy, the story
leads the BBC news bulletins, and it will dominate serious news
coverage for days if not weeks to come.
</P>
<P>
   As Draper sees it, that will be unsurprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the American royal family, aren't they?'' she asked.

DEMPS SAYS HE IS READY TO EASE `BURDEN' OF CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The simple question stirs a passionate
response from Benjamin Demps Jr. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why would a 65-year-old with no experience in public education
want to leave a comfortable life of semiretirement in Oklahoma City
to take on what many consider the metropolitan area's major puzzle
-- the Kansas City School District? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things in life that go beyond comfort,'' said
Demps, a retired Federal Aviation Administration official who
served as director of the Oklahoma Department of Human Services in
the early 1990s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that all of those children would be entering into
society in the United States ... without a capacity to perform at a
standard Americans generally would look for,'' Demps said Saturday
to The Kansas City Star. ``That is one heck of a burden for young
people in America to have to deal with. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to educate our children in America irrespective of
the color of their skin. That's what I feel. Have I felt this
strongly about it? Yes. Have I had an opportunity to voice it? No.
I have never been in a position to do something for an organization
with the duty of educating children. That's what's driving me. To
me, that's pretty doggone exciting and challenging -- to get it
done.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The school board and Demps reached agreement Friday on a
two-year contract that would pay him about $200,000 a year in
salary and benefits. Demps celebrated the deal by taking in a
late-night showing of the latest Star Wars movie. He left midway
through. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My mind was on other things,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Demps' contract still must be approved by the court-appointed
Desegregation Monitoring Committee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reached in Florida on Saturday night, committee chairman John
Murphy said approval was assured. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh sure, absolutely, no problem, no question at all,'' Murphy
said. ``I'm pleased. He's a fine man, and maybe now we can all work
together and move things forward rapidly.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Board members expect to introduce Demps to U.S. District Judge
Dean Whipple at a court hearing scheduled for 10 a.m. Monday. He is
scheduled to start work Aug. 1. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Demps on Saturday declined to outline his plan for the first
weeks of his administration. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some very cogent thoughts about that, but I have not
yet put the priorities in order,'' he said. ``I'm not, at this
point, ready to say what those are.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said he would move quickly to hire a top educator to oversee
instructional issues. Demps said he already had contacted various
education experts and others, seeking input on candidates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Demps also met for about two hours Saturday afternoon with
Arthur A. Benson II, attorney for the plaintiff schoolchildren in
the desegregation lawsuit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a very informative exchange,'' Benson said. ``I'm very
favorably impressed. He had many very perceptive questions, none of
which I feel at liberty to share.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Demps said he was not bothered that the board first offered the
job to two other candidates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Jay T. Edwards and former U.S.
education commissioner Pascal Forgione both withdrew in the midst
of negotiations. A fourth finalist, John Martin, was never offered
the job but also withdrew. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The point here is someone decided there were four individuals
who were competent or worthy of looking at and my name came
third,'' Demps said. ``If I were a football player picked in the
third round of the draft, I'd still be playing football. I still
have a chance to prove myself.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Demps said he would develop a positive relationship with the
school board, which voted 7-1, with one abstention, to approve his
contract. But he said he did not consider it his responsibility to
mend any rifts that exist among board members. He said conflict was
to be expected in any public body. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If all the citizens of a community were of one mind, we
wouldn't need these boards,'' he said. ``I don't see anything here
as adversarial. Reasonable people are going to differ always.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Demps said he would work with the monitoring committee. The
previous superintendent, Henry Williams, frequently complained
about the committee's authority over day-to-day district matters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a factor I must take into consideration,'' Demps
said. ``I must accept their direction if it's given, and if they
want to have a discourse I am certainly going to be eager to have
that discourse. I see no gain in fighting, fighting, fighting.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Demps said he was not worried about the negative publicity that
has dogged previous superintendents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That has nothing to do with me,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nor is he concerned about being in the public eye. Demps is
learning about the notoriety that surrounds the Kansas City school
superintendent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Returning to his hotel Friday evening just minutes after
reaching agreement on the contract, the doorman congratulated him
by name. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During a tour of the city Saturday, strangers frequently wished
him luck. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At his hotel Saturday evening, a man interrupted a conversation
to give Demps a thumbs-up and a word of encouragement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Demps said he planned to spend today relaxing and thinking about
what lies ahead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I have a chance to use my diverse experiences and bring
that together with my firm belief in the concept of America and
democracy and equality,'' he said. ``I can bring that all to bear
in one place. I'm excited about it.'' &QL;

 BOSTON: ... to the day.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For nearly 10 hours, the search centered on a nearly
1,000-square-mile area between the two airports, much of it around
Montauk, Coast Guard officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether a rescue effort might have been more effective if
begun sooner, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Steve Roark said: ``I
don't think so, because it was nighttime, and because of our
standard search procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how long the search would continue, Coast Guard commander
Mike Lapinski said: ``A lot of things come into play. The Coast
Guard is searching for survivors, and any indications there might
have been a chance of getting out and surviving and potentially
being in the water would lead them to continue. The more signs
there are, the longer we search.''
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Rear Admiral Richard Larrabee said Kennedy's
celebrity status had no bearing on the intensity of the search.
``Our efforts are consistent with the way we would search for
anyone who was lost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 1 p.m., the search shifted almost exclusively to
the waters off Martha's Vineyard, after beachgoers found items
linked to Kennedy's plane.
</P>
<P>
   Erin McCarthy, 31, of Boston, was sitting on the beach with her
friends when she spotted something in the water a short distance
from the shore. Thinking it might be debris from the crash, her
friend Damon Seligson, 30, a Boston lawyer, swam out to retrieve
it.
</P>
<P>
   It was a black canvas bag packed with clothes, a bathing suit,
cosmetics, and a hair dryer. The bag had an ID tag with Lauren
Bessette's business cards from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible sinking feeling,'' said Seligson. ``I felt
my heart burst out of my chest. It was just terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Campbell, 34, a private pilot from Greenwich, Conn., said
he saw the nose wheel and a part called a ``wheel pant'' from a
single-engine plane washed up on the beach. A short time later,
searchers turned up a headrest and part of a plane support called a
strut, said Coast Guard Lieutenant Craig Jaramillo.
</P>
<P>
   Later, authorities said they also had recovered an airplane
seat, a rubber cover for an airplane foot pedal, and a bottle of
prescription drugs belonging to Carolyn Bessette Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The plane Kennedy was flying was built in June 1995. He
purchased it used from Munir Hussain, a 39-year-old native of
Pakistan who runs a furniture factory in New Jersey. Hussain sold
it through a broker and said he believed Kennedy paid about
$300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hussain said he was at the Essex County Airport on Friday night
and noticed the plane was out of its hangar. He said he immediately
became worried when he was told Kennedy was solo at the controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a risky situation for him to be flying without an
instructor because he was not instrument-rated to fly on his own,''
Hussain said. ``I know that John was a very good pilot. Everyone
knew that. But I immediately began to worry because the conditions
were not that good.''
</P>
<P>
   Hussain said he had just landed his own plane at the airport and
believed that the visibility was not ideal, around 6 miles. While
it was still clear enough to take off without instruments, he felt
that it was ``too risky'' for someone without instrument
certification to do so.
</P>
<P>
   An FAA source said Kennedy had completed just 46 hours of flight
time since obtaining his solo license in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking federal transportation official said the National
Transportation Safety Board had pulled the maintenance records of
the plane and found it to be well cared for.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently Kennedy did not fill his tanks prior to departure,
but records obtained by the safety board indicate there were at
least 90 gallons on board, plenty of fuel for a single-engine plane
to make that trip. However, the plane has two fuel tanks, one in
each wing, and a pilot must remember to switch from one to the
other before fuel runs out.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the proximity of the wreckage to Jacqueline Onassis'
former Vineyard home, the official speculated that Kennedy may have
been ``buzzing'' the property that he and his sister now own and
was caught in a thermal updraft by the Gay Head cliffs.
</P>
<P>
   A thermal updraft would cause the plane to rise suddenly, and
the normal response of the pilot would be to push the yoke down to
lower the nose. Once the plane cleared the updraft, the plane could
suddenly dive. At low altitudes, such a move could be catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't count the number of times I have seen low-time pilots,
with family or friends on board, showing off by buzzing their house
and get into trouble,'' the source said. ``It is a mistake many
low-time pilots make.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane itself was not considered particularly difficult to
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The handling characteristics are very benign,'' said Warren
Morningstar, director of media relations for the Aircraft Owners
and Pilots Association, a general aviation lobbying group. ``It is
not the sort of plane you would want to learn to fly in, but it
should not be a handful for a low-time pilot who had proper
training in the aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls began flooding into the Kennedy compound around 7
a.m. Saturday. President Clinton, who was spending the weekend at
Camp David, learned of the disappearance from his chief of staff,
John Podesta, and telephoned Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Andrew
Cuomo, the Housing and Urban Development Department chief, who is
married to Kerry Kennedy, a daughter of RFK.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called JFK Jr.'s sister, Caroline Kennedy
Schlossberg, who was reportedly on vacation out West. She was
expected to join the family soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our prayers and thoughts are with the families of those on
board,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's disappearance came one day before the 30th
anniversary of the day Edward Kennedy's car went off a dirt road at
Chappaquiddick, killing passenger Mary Jo Kopechne on the tiny
island adjacent to Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in May 1998, three weeks after he received his
pilot's license, Kennedy told USA Today that none of his relatives
could be persuaded to fly with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only person I've been able to get to go up with me, who
looks forward to it as much as I do, is my wife,'' he said.
``Whenever we want to get away, we can just get in a plane and fly
off.''

GUERRILLA WAR RAVAGES ECONOMY IN COLOMBIA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Sub to update 5th graf) 
 
By JOHN OTIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Despite the huge body count from the recent
offensive by Marxist rebels, the economic carnage was almost as
shocking.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting began July 8 when guerrillas attacked the mountain
hamlet of Gutierrez, located just 25 miles south of Bogota. Army
generals erroneously portrayed the assault as a rebel push toward
the Colombian capital. Investors panicked and pulled millions of
dollars from the country. The Colombian peso lost 4 percent of its
value.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the headlines, you'd think it was Vietnam all over
again,'' says one New York-based financial analyst, referring to
the fall of Saigon to Communist rebels in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC,
rebels lack the wherewithal to seize major cities and steered clear
of Bogota. But the offensive, which left a combined death toll of
more than 300, illustrates how the combat and Colombia's image as a
chaotic nation on the brink can rattle the markets.
</P>
<P>
   Concern over the slumping economy has put more pressure on the
Colombian government to achieve a breakthrough in long-awaited
peace talks with the FARC, which were postponed indefinitely
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiating teams will meet in Uribe, a village 100 miles south
of Bogota, to explore ways to end the 35-year-old conflict. The
last round of peace talks broke off in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced that if they don't make progress in the peace
process, Colombia is not going to be able to return to the levels
of economic growth that it needs,'' said Joel Korn, a country
analyst with the Inter-American Development Bank in Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever sensed so much concern and pessimism
about the way things are going,'' he said. ``People who have the
money to invest and are quite committed to being here are now
saying that it's just not worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, it was easier for business people to ignore the
fighting since it was confined to remote jungle areas and had
limited economic impact.
</P>
<P>
   But the FARC now has 17,000 fighters spread across much of the
country. The government spends vast sums to maintain its
146,000-man army and to rebuild wrecked infrastructure. Businesses
shell out millions for armored cars, security guards and kidnapping
insurance, since the guerrillas abduct hundreds of wealthy
Colombians and foreigners every year.
</P>
<P>
   Experts believe that the fighting and related security costs
shave between three and five points off Colombia's annual gross
domestic product, the sum of all goods and services produced within
the country's borders. After decades of robust growth, the economy
is expected to shrink this year by as much as 2 percent _ which
would be Colombia's worst performance since the Great Depression.
In the first quarter of this year, the economy contracted by 5.8
percent, compared to the first quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Finance Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo announced that,
for the first time in the country's history, Colombia was turning
to the International Monetary Fund for help. Colombia will receive
a $3 billion line of credit from the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone from business tycoons to the corner grocer feels the
heat.
</P>
<P>
   For Andres Sierra, a butcher in Bogota, the war means higher
meat prices because the FARC collects ``war taxes'' from ranchers
who, in turn, charge more for their cattle at the slaughterhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's come to the extreme where the simple farmer who grows a
plot of potatoes has to pay the rebels,'' Sierra said.
</P>
<P>
   At Alcimotores, a Bogota auto dealership, demand for luxury cars
and sport utility vehicles has plunged. A salesman explained that
buyers prefer stripped-down models to avoid the appearance of
wealth and the risk of being kidnapped at guerrilla roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict has touched off an international commercial
dispute. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez banned Colombian truck
drivers from entering his country last week in retaliation for the
threat of assaults, kidnappings and shakedowns that Venezuelan
truck drivers face on Colombian highways.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia truck drivers ``can go all the way to Caracas and
nothing happens to them,'' Chavez said. ``Venezuelan truck drivers
who go over there have to enter in war tanks to protect
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombians who can afford it are emigrating in droves. In the
first four months of this year, 65,000 Colombians left the country
and didn't return.
</P>
<P>
   At the U.S. Embassy in Bogota, applications for visas have
increased by 30 percent. In a recent Gallup poll of Colombians, 54
percent of the respondents said they have considered moving abroad
while 32 percent said they would marry a foreigner to facilitate
their departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want their kids to grow up this way, so if they
have a chance to leave, they go. It makes sense,'' said Roberto
Steiner, an economist at the University of the Andes in Bogota. He
warns that this ``brain drain'' will take years to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   But many Colombians believe that if negotiations with the
guerrillas are successful, the country would reap a substantial
``peace dividend.''
</P>
<P>
   Steiner points out that neighboring Peru suffered through 12
years of terror by Shining Path guerrillas. But after Shining Path
leader Abimael Guzman was captured in 1992, foreign investment
flowed and Peru's economy took off.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people hope that something similar happens here,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts point out, however, that the FARC has the upper hand in
the war and say that the demoralized Colombian army lacks the
manpower, weapons and commitment to defeat them. Meanwhile, it's
unclear whether the FARC really wants peace.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations were originally scheduled to begin in January, but
FARC leader Manuel ``Sure Shot'' Marulanda skipped the inaugural
ceremony. Since then, the rebels have delayed the start-up date
while carrying out a wave of spectacular assaults on army and
police units. All along, they have refused pleas for a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Because the rebels are stronger than ever, the government may
have to offer major concessions to forge a truce.
</P>
<P>
   Just to persuade the FARC to come to the table, the government
withdrew troops from five municipalities in southern Colombia and
proclaimed the region a demilitarized zone. The rebels launched
raids from bases inside the zone during their latest offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to prepare ourselves for the idea that peace
will be very costly. In the short and medium term, it will have
more costs than benefits,'' said Juan Jose Echavarria, director of
Fedesarollo, a private Bogota think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe that the talks could quickly break down because
the two sides have little in common. On economic issues, for
example, the government has pursued an aggressive free-market
approach while the guerrillas are dogmatic Marxists.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC wants half of the national budget dedicated to health
and education and has called for state management of
telecommunications, ports and natural resources, such as oil.
Marulanda, the FARC leader, has reportedly said that even
Colombia's newspapers should be run by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any economic idea that comes from the guerrillas is bad,''
said Steiner, the University of the Andes economist. ``They are
communists. They have spent 30 years studying a model that doesn't
work. And the model that does work, they don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Few economists believe that the government will consider deep
structural changes.
</P>
<P>
   But the two sides do share common ground on points like agrarian
reform and the need for sustained development in rural areas. From
the beginning, poverty in the countryside and distorted ratios of
land distribution have helped fueled the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where you should make the biggest concessions,'' said
Juan Pablo Gonzalez, vice president of the Bogota Stock Exchange.
``But if profitability in the countryside is negative, you don't
solve anything by distributing the land among many people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing you get is a larger number of bankrupt
people.''
</P>

   Philadelphia's Mike Lieberthal leads NL catchers in RBI, but
it's his defensive ability that has helped turn the Phillies into a

</P>
<P>
   Lieberthal, the Westlake High product who played in his first

Texas catcher Ivan Rodriguez, eight-time All-Star and eight-time
Gold Glove winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to get as much out of him as I can,'' Lieberthal said.
``He's definitely the one guy I watch more than any other. He's one
of the few catchers who plays 150 games a year. That's something I
want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Phillies only play the Rangers a couple of times a
year in spring training, Lieberthal always spends time talking to
Rodriguez about how he approaches the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talks to me a lot about things behind the plate,''
Rodriguez said. ``I like it when people come up to me and ask what
they should do. That means they want to be a better player.
Lieberthal is the kind of guy who likes to learn. I'm not surprised
he's an All-Star. He's a great hitter.'' &QL; 
__ Trachsel hopes for better
</P>
<P>
   Cubs right-hander Steve Trachsel finally stopped his losing
streak at eight last Sunday, beating the White Sox 6-3. Trachsel, a
15-game winner last year, starts the second half 3-12.
</P>
<P>
   While Trachsel has a 6.53 ERA, don't be surprised if the Cubs
find a way to trade him before the July 31 deadline. His contract
is up after this season and they would love him to have a few more
good starts so they can get something for him.
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel isn't the only struggling pitcher on the staff. Cubs
starters had an 8.97 ERA from June 9 to July 8, but the team
doesn't thipX&AMP;SyTi+$K$XZYHW-[YK,X9

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- John F. Kennedy Jr., who crawled out from under his
father's Oval Office desk into a life of tragedy-tinged celebrity,
was presumed dead Saturday along with his wife and her sister when
the small plane he was piloting apparently crashed off Martha's
Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Hope that the free-spirited member of the nation's most
chronicled political family had simply made an unscheduled landing
dimmed at midday, when wreckage and luggage were found 30 yards off
Philbin Beach at the westernmost end of the island. A short walk
down the beach is the Vineyard home that Kennedy and his sister
inherited from their mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   As darkness fell, no bodies had been found despite an intensive
search involving the Coast Guard, Air Force, Air National Guard,
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Civil Air Patrol,
and scores of private vessels. Most of the search efforts were
suspended around 9 p.m., with plans to resume this morning. Late
Saturday night, the National Transportation Safety Board said it
will conduct an investigation of the aircraft's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said it was too early to speculate on the cause of
the crash, but preliminary efforts are focusing on Kennedy's
becoming disoriented because of poor visibility and losing control
of the plane, fuel mismanagement, or loss of control after doing a
flyby of the family property.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 38, a onetime Manhattan prosecutor who left the law to
become publisher of George magazine, was accompanied by his wife,
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her older sister, Lauren Bessette.
They were aboard his single-engine Piper Saratoga II HP, a plane
the novice pilot had purchased just 10 weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and his wife planned to drop off her sister on Martha's
Vineyard, then head to Hyannis for the wedding of a cousin, Rory
Kennedy, the youngest child of the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy.
The wedding scheduled for Saturday was postponed, and plans for a
celebratory Mass were replaced by the familiar and familial sound
of mournful prayers.
</P>
<P>
   The entourage had set out at 8:38 p.m. Friday from Essex County
Airport in Fairfield, N.J., and was expected to land at Martha's
Vineyard Airport by 10 p.m. Kennedy was not required to file a
flight plan, and had not done so.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who received his solo pilot license last year, took off
into a hazy, moonless sky from the New Jersey airport, and some
pilots questioned whether he was experienced enough to fly under
such conditions. Kennedy was not certified to fly solely via
instruments, and would have had to rely on visual cues.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Bailey, an experienced private pilot who also had planned
to fly from New Jersey to Martha's Vineyard Friday night, changed
his mind when he saw the sky. ``I felt it was too hazy and I didn't
want to chance it over open water,'' said Bailey, who said he saw
the Kennedy group at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   He said Kennedy, clad in a T-shirt and a baseball cap turned
backward, arrived in a white convertible.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said he noticed Kennedy was limping around the plane
during his preflight check; Kennedy had hurt himself several weeks
ago in a paragliding accident. Kennedy arrived at the airport
around 8 p.m.; his wife arrived shortly after, dressed all in
black, and they left without delay.
</P>
<P>
   Once airborne, Kennedy made no voice contact with the Martha's
Vineyard Airport, but his six-seat, red-and-white plane was last
spotted on radar at 9:39 p.m. on what appeared to be a final
approach to the landing strip.
</P>
<P>
   A review of radar records showed the plane was 17 miles
west/southwest of the airport at an altitude of 2,200 feet. On the
next radar pass, 12 seconds later, the plane had dropped to 1,300
feet. Twelve seconds later, the plane was nowhere to be seen,
sources with the Federal Aviation Administration said.
</P>
<P>
   The precipitous drop in altitude apparently did not trigger
action by flight controllers because, without a flight plan and
with no voice contact, they had no reason to pay the aircraft any
heed and might not have even noticed the drop, according to FAA
officials and authorities on flight procedures.
</P>
<P>
   While family and friends held vigil at the Kennedys' Hyannis
Port compound, the presumed death of the man known to the wrld as
``John-John'' added a sad new chapter to a family history in which
glory and sorrow alternate like day and night.
</P>
<P>
   The victories have come mainly from voters and shrewd
investments, while the losses have come from even more capricious
sources, including assassins, drugs, and the trees of Aspen. Even
before Friday's apparent plane crash, the family has suffered air
tragedies before: Kennedy's uncle, Navy Lieutenant Joseph P.
Kennedy Jr., died in 1944 when his bomber exploded over England;
his aunt, Kathleen (Kennedy) Harrington, was killed in 1948 when
the plane she was aboard crashed in France.
</P>
<P>
   Fears about John F. Kennedy Jr., his 33-year-old wife, and her
sister began in earnest sometime after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:15 a.m., a friend of the Kennedys called the Coast Guard
station in Woods Hole to say Kennedy and Bessette were late. Woods
Hole called the Coast Guard's Boston station, which in turn called
the FAA. The Air Force and the FAA, which also received a call from
the Kennedy family, then began calling other airports to see if the
plane had landed somewhere else or perhaps never took off.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, a satellite picked up an emergency beacon
signal off Montauk, N.Y. No immediate action was taken because it
is standard procedure to wait for additional beacon ``hits'' to
pinpoint the location of a downed airplane, said Coast Guard Petty
Officer Todd Burgun.
</P>
<P>
   After a second beacon signal was received, a ``case'' was opened
at 3:28 a.m. by the Air Force's Air Rescue Coordination Center
outside Washington, D.C., which oversees searches for missing
aircraft. However, it was not known whether the signal had come
from Kennedy's plane because the beacon did not have a
``signature'' to indicate its source.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:30 a.m., a 41-foot Coast Guard utility vessel began
searching the area off Montauk, followed by another utility boat
and several larger vessels before dawn. They found nothing. At
dawn, the Civil Air Patrol of the Air Force joined the search with
15 single-engine planes, focusing almost exclusively along the Long
Island coastline.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the sky throughout the day were two Coast Guard H60
Jayhawk helicopters, a Coast Guard Falcon jet, and a huge C-130
from the Air National Guard, which provided in-flight air traffic
control of the search planes. The same plane was involved in the
aftermath of the crash of TWA flight 800, which plunged into nearby
waters three years ago to the day.

INTENSIVE SEARCH NORMAL, OFFICIALS SAY, BUT LEVEL OF INTEREST FAR
FROM COMMON  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It began with a 2 a.m. phone call from a Kennedy
family friend to the Coast Guard office in Woods Hole, Mass.,
reporting a private airplane missing. The information the caller
gave was sketchy. She did not, at first, even identify the
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   But within three hours, the Air Force was investigating, the
White House had been alerted, and a host of Cabinet members were
soon to be immersed in a drama that brought many of them to their
offices on a summer Saturday. By sunup, the search for the
single-engine plane of John F. Kennedy Jr. had blossomed into a
military-style mission, monitored by President Clinton, that
scoured the waters off the Northeast coast with combat rescue
planes, helicopters and boats.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities insisted Saturday that they have treated the
hunt for the Kennedy plane as they would the search for any missing
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   They said the armada of boats and covey of planes, and the small
army of pilots, Coast Guard officers, Air Force reservists and
volunteers enlisted to operate them, would be deployed for any
search and rescue effort that required them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We treat all searches the same _ there's no difference between
a celebrity and a noncelebrity,'' said Lt. Col. Steve Roark, the
director of the Air Force National Search and Rescue School.
</P>
<P>
   What was different about this search, of course, was the intense
level of interest, from the White House on down, almost from the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force notified the so-called situation room at the White
House at about 5 a.m., said Jake Siewart, a White House spokesman.
That was about the time that investigators began to scramble to get
planes in the air and boats in the water, after establishing that
Kennedy's plane was indeed missing in flight.
</P>
<P>
   A short while later, the White House chief-of-staff, John D.
Podesta, was notified. Thurgood Marshall Jr., the Cabinet
secretary, was called and told to coordinate efforts with
secretaries of the various agencies that could be involved. At
about 7 a.m., Podesta called President Clinton, who was at Camp
David with the first lady, to inform him of the missing plane.
</P>
<P>
   From that point on, according to officials, the president and
his top aides became the contact points for members of the Kennedy
family. Sen. Edward Kennedy spoke with the transportation and
defense secretaries. Andrew M. Cuomo, the housing secretary who is
related by marriage to the Kennedys, spoke regularly with the White
House during the day. At one point, officials said, Clinton called
Caroline Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coast Guard response has been the same as it would be for
anyone, but what gets added on with somebody of this notoriety is
the communications aspect,'' said Commander Thomas K. Ritchey, a
Coast Guard congressional liaison who was one of many officials
called in to his headquarters office in Washington Saturday to
field calls and gather information.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're searching for J.F.K. Jr., so therefore the Kennedy
family is going to immediately want to be in communication with the
highest level of government, he added. ``So the normal working
levels of the Coast Guard and the Air Force are briefing levels and
levels above their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   The earliest information to the authorities was limited and
rough.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The woman caller, who has not been identified, told the night
duty officers at the U.S. Coast Guard group office in Woods Hole,
that a single-engine plane had left Essex County Airport in New
Jersey with three people on board, but had not arrived as expected
at the Duke's County airport at Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Officers called the woman back after five minutes for more
details. That was when they first learned that the occupants of the
missing plane were celebrities, according to Lt. Craig Jaramillo of
the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   The Woods Hole officers called their commanders in Boston, who
called the Federal Aviation Administration and the Air Force Rescue
Coordination Center at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at about 3 a.m., officials began the laborious process
of checking by phone whether anyone, anywhere _ in the air, in an
air traffic control tower or on the ground at any one of a dozen or
more small airports in the area _ had seen the Kennedy plane.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the night, many of the airfields were closed.
Because Kennedy had not filed a flight plan with the New Jersey
airport, none of the air traffic control towers had been in
communication with him. Radar at various points along his route,
presumably, had seen him. But investigators had to find and review
radar pictures from the night before to try and identify a track
that could be the Kennedy plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the normal procedure,'' said Roark, who was filling in
as director of the rescue coordination center at Langley Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The painstaking process of reviewing radar records from the
night before and telephoning air traffic control centers finally
paid off. At about 5 a.m., the Air Force investigators were
provided a radar track of a plane that had followed the Kennedy
plane's assumed route and time of flight. The data, they said, came
from the Air Route Traffic Control Center in Ronkonkoma, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   It did not tell the fate of the plane but it did provide some
clues for organizing the rescue effort. The plane's last location
monitored by radar was about 17 miles southwest of Martha's
Vineyard, at a point where it might have begun its normal descent.
</P>
<P>
   The radar tracked the plane until it flew too low to be picked
up by that radar station, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like a normal flight to me,'' said Roark, who
studied the track of the plane. ``It looked like it was on its
descent. I didn't see anything unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   By about 7:30 a.m., the Air Force and Coast Guard had launched
planes, helicopters and ships along the plane's assumed route. One
of the first calls went to the 106th Rescue Wing of the New York
State Air National Guard at Francis S. Gabreski Airport in
Westhampton, Long Island. The unit has been involved in many
high-profile military rescues, including that of the downed Air
Force pilot over Yugoslavia during the NATO bombing of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   One of its HC-130 Hercules search and rescue planes was already
fueled and ready to take off for a mission to monitor a planned
shuttle launch at the John F. Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   It was diverted, on orders from top Air Force commanders, to the
search for the Kennedy plane. Later in the morning, a second HC-130
from the unit was added to help coordinate from the air all the
various planes involved in the search.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some phone calls were made very quickly,'' said Lt. Col.
Anthony Cristiano, a spokesman for the rescue wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew who it was,'' he added. ``But to us, a person is a
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Cristiano said the unit's HC-130 planes are normally used for
long-range oceanic rescue missions because they can refuel
helicopters in flight and contain platforms that can be dropped
into the water for a sea rescue. Cristiano added that they have
been used occasionally for civilian search operations. During the
past year, he said, they were called upon to find and rescue a
boater in the Atlantic Ocean who had had a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The searchers also used an HH60-G helicopter from the rescue
wing, 15 search planes from Civil Air Patrol units in New York, New
Jersey, Rhode Island, Connecticut and Massachusetts, numerous Coat
Guard boats, and eventually the survey ship Rude from the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which was involved in the
recovery operation after the crash of TWA Flight 800.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coast Guard assets sounded pretty normal, although the Air
Force did roll out some assets that were maybe a little unusual,''
said Drew Steketee, senior vice-president for communications at the
Airline Pilots and Owners Association.
</P>
<P>
   Offers of help also poured in from governors' offices, local
police departments, private pilots and boaters, and other federal
law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Customs Service at Islip, N.Y., on Long Island, sent up
one of its A-STAR helicopters that are usually used to hunt drug
smugglers at sea.
</P>
<P>
   And the Woods Hole Coast Guard officers, as well as the Air
National Guard staff on Long Island, said they fielded calls all
day from psychics and other people offering help.

HOPE DIMS AS SEARCH CONTINUES FOR JFK JR. 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The prospect grew stronger late Saturday that yet
another deadly tragedy may have befallen the Kennedy family as
searchers in boats and helicopters combed the waters near Martha's
Vineyard, where a plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and
sister-in-law had apparently crashed.
</P>
<P>
   The son of the former president, still known to many Americans
as ``John John,'' was on his way to a cousin's wedding Friday night
when the plane he was piloting failed to show up at the resort
island off of Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   By midday Saturday, Coast Guard officials had determined that
the single-engine, six-seat Piper Saratoga, which had embarked from
northern New Jersey, had likely gone down about 17 miles off the
coast of Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 38, had been traveling with his wife, Carolyn Bessette,
33, and her 35-year-old sister Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   While the Coast Guard, aided by the Air Force, had not located
bodies or substantive wreckage by late Saturday, they found
pertinent debris, including luggage belonging to Lauren Bessette, a
prescription drug bottle in the name of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy,
and a cosmetics bag. They also picked up an aircraft seat, a black
pedal cover and landing gear parts belonging to a plane that fit
the description of the aircraft flown by Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard temporarily called off the aerial search after
nightfall Saturday, but kept a helicopter with special infrared
heat-seeking equipment aloft through the night to try to detect
material or bodies in the search area.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Coast Guard will be aided through the night hours by a
research vessel operated by the National Oceanographic and
Atmospheric Administration. The vessel, called Rude, uses sonar to
detect wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that the chances of finding anyone alive were dimming as
the day wore on, Coast Guard searchers late Saturday were still
classifying their operation as a search-and-rescue effort.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Richard M. Larrabee, the First District Coast Guard
Commander in Boston, said searchers had not given up hope that the
plane's passengers might be alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you miraculous stories about people surviving. I
can tell you in previous cases like this we've searched for as many
as three or four days. We're not ready to give up on this yet, and
we're going to continue to focus on search and rescue,'' said
Larrabee.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the ominous feeling that another member of this famous
family had met a premature death appeared only to grow as the day
wore on. As they have so many times in the past, the Kennedys
secluded themselves at the family compound in Hyannis Port awaiting
the news and comforting one another. Ironically, many family
members had visited for a joyous occasion, the wedding of Rory
Kennedy, the daughter of Robert and Ethel Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   JFK Jr. was expected to attend the wedding after dropping off
Lauren Bessette in Martha's Vineyard and continuing on to Hyannis
Port. But the wedding was called off, and the white tent that had
been pitched for dining instead became a sanctuary for prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Police on Saturday afternoon cleared the beach on a section of
Martha's Vineyard popularly known as Gay Head as debris from what
appeared to be the Kennedy's plane started washing ashore.
</P>
<P>
   Erin McCarthy, 31, of Boston, who was sun bathing on the beach,
told The Associated Press she saw a black bag with Lauren
Bessette's name on it in the water. A friend, Damon Seligson, waded
in to retrieve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of like, `Oh, God.' It seemed like it would be
pretty bad news. Everyone was shaking,'' said McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   The news of Kennedy's disappearance shocked a nation that for
decades has been transfixed by the towering successes and
astounding tragedies of a family that has come closer than any
other to American royalty.
</P>
<P>
   At airports people stood dumbfounded in front of television sets
while politicians, including Vice President Al Gore, offered words
of support for the family. All of the major television networks
broke into their regular coverage to provide updates on the search
as well as to once again chronicle the Kennedy family saga.
</P>
<P>
   It is a story that includes the assassination of Kennedy's
father in 1963 and his uncle Robert five years later. The weekend
also marked the 30th anniversary of the Chappiquidick incident when
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., drove a car into the water near a
tiny island next to Martha's Vineyard, resulting in the drowning of
his passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, died of cancer in
1994. JFK Jr. has one sister, Carolyn, who was rafting out West
when the plane went down.
</P>
<P>
   For the older generation, the image of Kennedy still remains
that of the young ``John John'' frolicking in the Oval Office and
later standing at attention saluting his father's casket as it
rolled down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   But for those born after his father's death, the younger Kennedy
was America's heartthrob, considered one of the sexiest men in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   While others mentioned him as a possible political candidate,
the younger Kennedy did not demonstrate the same affinity for
elected office as some of his cousins. After graduating from law
school he found his niche in publishing by launching George
magazine. Three years ago he married Carolyn Bessette, a poised and
beautiful woman who specialized in public relations.
</P>
<P>
   The couple lived in the trendy Manhattan neighborhood of
Tribeca.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago Kennedy obtained his pilot's license. On Friday, he
took off from Essex County Airport in Fairfield , N.J., about 8:30
p.m. EDT with the expectation of landing in Martha's Vineyard about
10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   When the plane did not arrive, family members alerted the Coast
Guard around 2:15 a.m. About 3:30 a.m. the Air Force received a
signal from Long Island that it initially thought might have come
from the downed plane. But that signal proved to be a false lead.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:30 am, the Coast Guard launched a full-scale search ranging
from New Jersey to the Massachusetts coast. Since Kennedy had not
filed a flight plan, officials could not be sure where the plane
might have gone down.
</P>
<P>
   But by midday, the Coast Guard had narrowed down the likely
crash area to 17 miles off the coast of Martha's Area, the last
place where the FAA had been able to track the plane. Shortly after
that debris from the plane was discovered off of Philbin Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA reported that it had lost contact with the plane while
it was on final approach to the Martha's Vineyard airport about
9:39 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   A Coast Guard official involved in the search said Saturday that
radar signals Friday night showed a plane approaching the airport
at an altitude of 2,500 feet, then descending to 2,200 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Only 12 seconds later, the time it takes the radar to make one
sweep, the device showed the plane at 1,300 feet, indicating a
descent rate of about 4,000 feet per minute that would be reached
only in a steep dive.
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee said that it was not unusual for Kennedy not to file a
flight plan. Nor did he believe there was any equipment problems or
severe weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no indication that there was anything out of the
ordinary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee said that while it was hot and hazy Saturday ``the
search conditions are good.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the water depths in the area range from 20 to 100 feet.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending July 10 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such

subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.

domestic rupture featuring parents and children brought face to
face with their own insignificance by infidelity and broken
marriages. But the characters seem to find a way to manage, thanks
mostly to the balms of friendship and humor. ``Hers is a palette of
compassionately wielded pastels, and her stories are watercolors of
the highest order, ``Lorrie Moore wrote in The New York Times Book
Review last year. ``One feels amazed at the confidence, steadiness
and quality of the output.''

   &UR; MENDEL'S DWARF &LR;  By Simon Mawer. Penguin, $12.95. This ambitious
novel about a brilliant genetic scientist _ and dwarf _ whose
great-great-great-uncle was the pioneering geneticist Gregor Mendel
explores the moral, historical and philosophical implications of
their research. The result is ``an odd and affecting literary
experiment,'' Francine Prose wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE FIRE WITHIN THE EYE: A HISTORICAL ESSAY ON THE NATURE AND
MEANING OF LIGHT &LR;  By David Park. Princeton University, $16.95. A
physics professor sweeps through an amazing array of material, from
atomic theory in ancient Greece to the invention of the laser, to
answer a still-perplexing question: What is light? Is it a thing or
a quality? In 1997, Dick Teresi called this ``a graceful book.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE WILD PARTY: THE LOST CLASSIC &LR;  By Joseph Moncure March.
Illustrated by Art Spiegelman. Pantheon, $12. This ribald
ballad-novel, originally published in 1928 and reissued in 1995
with demonic illustrations by Art Spiegelman, uses rhymed couplets
to conjure a night of Jazz Age debauchery orchestrated by a saucy
pair of lovers named Queenie and Burrs. ``It's quite addictive,''
Margo Jefferson wrote in The New York Times. ``We forget ... how
potent cheap verse can be.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GAIN &LR;  By Richard Powers. Picador USA, $14. Two stories _ one
tracing the rise of a family soap-and-candle business into a
conglomerate, the other about an Illinois woman who blames the
company's chemicals for her ovarian cancer _ draw a link between
the growth of corporations and the decline of humane values. Last
year the reviewer Bruce Bawer called this novel ``erudite,
penetrating and splendidly written.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE PROCESS: 1,100 DAYS THAT CHANGED THE MIDDLE EAST &LR;  By Uri
Savir. Vintage, $15. The chief Israeli negotiator during the three
years leading up to the Oslo peace accords chronicles both the
arduous political jousting and the mutual respect that developed
among participants on both sides. The result is ``an insider's
story of how bitter contenders for the same tiny patch of parched
land struggled to disentangle their mutual hatreds, grievances and
claims,'' Serge Schmemann wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; THE DREAM PALACE OF THE ARABS:
A GENERATION'S ODYSSEY &LR; , by Fouad Ajami ($14), in which a noted
scholar maintains that Arab writers and intellectuals have neither
accommodated to reality nor created the world they desperately
need. ``He gives a vivid and often moving account of Arab thought
today,'' Ira M. Lapidus wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MAN OR MANGO? A LAMENT &LR;  By Lucy Ellmann. Picador USA, $12. A
grumpy hermit living with her cello and her cats in an English
village finds her solitude threatened by her equally sour
ex-boyfriend. Last year the reviewer Lisa Zeidner called this novel
``a rambling, sometimes very funny rant about love and
loneliness.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WE'LL CALL YOU IF WE NEED YOU: EXPERIENCES OF WOMEN WORKING
CONSTRUCTION &LR;  By Susan Eisenberg. ILR/Cornell University, $14.95.
Using firsthand accounts, a master electrician and poet celebrates
the feminist pioneers who braved abuse and even mortal danger to
enter the building trades in the late 1970s. ``This is an
inspirational, life-affirming book,'' Samuel C. Florman wrote in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AMERICAN BANDSTAND: DICK CLARK AND THE MAKING OF A ROCK 'N'
ROLL EMPIRE &LR;  By John A. Jackson. Oxford University, $16.95. This
account of the television hit that put rock 'n' roll on the
pop-culture map portrays its bland but cunning host as one of
rock's kingmakers in the 1950s and '60s. In 1997 the reviewer Fred
Goodman called this an ``evenhanded and carefully researched''
book.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHY THE TREE LOVES THE AX &LR;  By Jim Lewis. Berkley, $12.95. A
mysterious woman settles in a sleepy Texas town after miraculously
surviving a car accident, but finds she can't shake her troubled
past. Last year the reviewer Sarah Ferguson called this a
``haunting exploration of memory and identity.''

MONDESI'S HOMER A HIT WITH TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ After Raul Mondesi reached home plate Saturday
after his first home run since June 8, he punched the air. He
smacked Gary Sheffield's hand with a resounding high five and waded
into the Dodgers dugout like a heavyweight coming into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt great freedom,'' Mondesi said after the Dodgers 13-3
victory over the Angels at Edison Field. ``I never gave up hope,
never lost confidence. I figured if I worked hard, it would come
back to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi hit his 20th homer of the season off knuckleballer Steve
Sparks, a two-out, two-run shot in the third that gave the Dodgers
a 4-0 lead. It was just his second since May 28. He had gone 112
at-bats without a homer, including a first-inning strikeout that
made him 1 for 10 in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shot was so important to this team,'' said Eric Karros,
who hit two homers to move within one of Mondesi for the team lead.
``We don't have one guy who can carry the team. Everyone has to
contribute. We've missed him. I hope he's back.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi also doubled to right in the ninth and scored the
Dodgers' final run. Manager Davey Johnson said the double was just
as impressive because it showed Mondesi was using the whole field.
</P>
<P>
   ``When players get frustrated, they try to pull everything,''
Johnson said. ``You could see a big load had been lifted from his
shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   __ More bad news: Antonio Osuna's injury-plagued season could be
over. The Dodgers relief pitcher learned Saturday he has a partial
tear of the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna, who underwent an MRI Thursday, is expected to decide
today whether to have season-ending surgery or seek an alternative
method. Early this season he balked at the thought of surgery to
remove bone chips from his elbow but went ahead after attempts to
throw pain-free failed. If Osuna has the surgery, it will be the
third on his right elbow since last August. He underwent the MRI
after experiencing discomfort in the elbow after pitching one
inning Wednesday in a rehab assignment for Class-A San Bernardino.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna made five appearances with the Dodgers this year, going
0-0 with a 7.71 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   __ Crime and punishment: The Dodgers were hoping NL president
Leonard Coleman might reduce the suspensions after requesting he
watch last Sunday's fight with Seattle a second time. It didn't
happen and coach Rick Dempsey began serving his 17-day suspension
that ends Aug. 3. Jamie Arnold, suspended five games and fined
$1,000, and Todd Hundley, suspended three games and fined $1,000,
have filed appeals and were available Saturday. Arnold took over
for Chan Ho Park with one out in the seventh inning and finished
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey, whose combative nature landed him in many fights during
his 24-year career, was suspended three games and fined $3,500 for
decking Philadelphia's Lenny Dykstra at home plate in 1990. In
perhaps the most famous fight involving the Dodgers, Giants pitcher
Juan Marichal was suspended eight games and fined $1,750 for
striking catcher John Roseboro over the head with a bat in August
1965. Roseboro later sued Marichal for $110,000 and settled for
$7,500.

RANGERS' WETTELAND ROUGHED UP AS DIAMONDBACKS WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
ARLINGTON _ The Rangers' manager says his closer will be fine.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rangers' pitching coach says the closer will be fine.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona manager Buck Showalter says the Rangers' John Wetteland
is ``as good as any closer you're going to find.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland's right elbow might be saying otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland's ninth- and 10th-inning failures during yesterday's
8-6 loss to the Diamondbacks fuel speculation regarding the
closer's health. Wetteland failed to convert his third consecutive
save opportunity and fifth in the past eight chances by
surrendering ninth-inning home runs to Arizona's Kelly Stinnett and
Jay Bell.
</P>
<P>
   The loss belonged to Wetteland, too, after left fielder Rusty
Greer lost a fly ball in the late-afternoon sun. The ball dropped
for a two-run double in the 10th, and that two-out ``hit'' by Tony
Womack scored two of the three runners right-hander Esteban Loaiza
inherited from the closer.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland (3-4) underwent arthroscopic surgery Oct. 27 to remove
a bone chip and spur from his right elbow, but the hard-throwing
right-hander will not use that as an alibi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where to go with that,'' said Wetteland, who
surrendered two home runs during a game for only the second time in
514 major-league appearances. ``You know what I'm going to say.
No.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Wetteland will concede that the surgery robbed him of his
best fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, there's a difference in velocity,'' Wetteland said,
``but if you throw four pitches _ and I'm mixing them all in _ you
should be able to work around that. It's not just fastballs I'm
getting beat on. I'm getting beat on fastballs. I'm getting beat on
curveballs. I'm getting beat on changeups and sliders.''
</P>
<P>
   Stinnett pounded an 0-1 curveball for his home run, while Bell
deposited an 0-1 fastball into The Ballpark in Arlington's
right-field seats for his game-tying blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not getting it done,'' said Wetteland, who has
surrendered eight home runs after allowing only six during all of
last season. ``There's no excuse for it. I'm just not getting the
job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland retired center fielder Steve Finley to begin the 10th
inning, but David Delluci lined a single off the pitcher's glove
for an infield single. Wetteland then made matters worse by issuing
consecutive walks to first baseman Travis Lee and shortstop Hanley
Frias to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates could watch no more and removed
Wetteland from a game for the first time this season. Loaiza
replaced Wetteland and struck out Stinnett for the inning's second
out and induced what appeared would be an inning-ending fly ball
from Womack.
</P>
<P>
   Left field, though, becomes a nightmare for an outfielder from 5
p.m. to 7:30 p.m., and Greer lost the ball in the bright sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I backed up to keep the ball from going by me,'' Greer said.
``I had no clue where it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Dellucci and Lee scored, and that would be the decisive blow in
a game that took nearly four hours to complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably one of the toughest periods of my career,''
said Wetteland, who has failed to convert seven of 33 save
opportunities. ``I honestly don't have a lot of answers for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates does not, either, but the manager dismissed the elbow as
the source for Wetteland's recent rash of failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing there physically wrong,'' Oates said. ``We'll
sit and talk and figure out the best thing to get him back on
track. John Wetteland is going to fine. The key is patience.'' nn

DEALEY PLAZA VISITORS SHOCKED, SADDENED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MARY DOCLAR and KRISTIN N. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Christine Gonzalez wept Saturday as she stood near the
sloping street where President Kennedy was assassinated almost 36
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the same spot where thousands of people from around the world
have come to mourn the dead president, Gonzalez came to pray for
Kennedy's son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just praying that he's not dead,'' said Gonzalez, 54, of
Grand Prairie. ``I have followed John-John's life. I just pray
against all odds that he's alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Hope mingled with grief Saturday as the crowds that flock to
Dealey Plaza each weekend coped with the news that John F. Kennedy
Jr., his wife and his sister-in-law were missing after their plane
disappeared near Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Memories of President Kennedy's last moments rolling down Elm
Street in his presidential motorcade were intertwined Saturday with
remembrances of his son, especially the unforgettable image of
3-year-old John-John saluting his father's coffin during Kennedy's
funeral procession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just horribly sad,'' said Anne Corrow of Plymouth, Minn.,
who visited Dealey Plaza and the Sixth Floor Museum, which is
dedicated to President Kennedy's life and death. ``I think it's
affected people. It's very quiet and people are very somber.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Sixth Floor Museum, visitors scrawled their reflections
about the latest tragedy on pieces of crisp, white paper in
three-ring leather binders. Fresh flowers were to be placed inside
the museum if John Kennedy Jr.'s death is confirmed, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be in Dallas at this time, on this day ...'' wrote Judy
Caputo of Cleveland, Ohio. ``My prayers are with the Kennedy
family, and thank you for this experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff West, executive director of the Sixth Floor Museum, said
that Saturday's grief was for the loss not only of the man with the
Hollywood good looks, but for someone with a bright political
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's a mourning of what would have been,'' West said.
``At 38 years old, he had years before he had to worry about time
running out.''
</P>
<P>
   Some tourists said that the loss of John Kennedy Jr. would truly
signal the end of the Kennedy dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``His life just started ... and then it's over,'' said Johnathan
Walker, 27, of Ontario, Canada. ``He just got married. He didn't
even have a chance to have a family. The Kennedy legacy ends now.
That line is gone.'' David Vershaw of Dallas said that his wife was
so upset by the situation that she stayed in the car while he,
Walker and another friend visited the Kennedy assassination site.
</P>
<P>
   ``There does seem to be a strange sense of irony to it,''
Vershaw said. ``I've heard that the family was cursed. I don't know
if I believe that, but they do have their share of tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the expressions of grief Saturday were impromptu. John
Nagel, a tour guide and sales director at The Conspiracy Museum in
downtown Dallas, walked down Elm Street carrying a white cross that
he said has been used to commemorate the anniversary of President
Kennedy's death.
</P>
<P>
   He placed the cross, which was decorated with artificial lilies
and the words ``JFK. Only truth shall keep us free,'' at the place
on Elm where President Kennedy was shot.
</P>
<P>
   Then he urged those around him to pray.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to let the Kennedy family know our prayers are with
them,'' he said, adding later, ``Maybe in a sad way, John-John got
to see his dad again.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the conspiracy theorists who gather at Dealey Plaza
every weekend were doing a brisk business Saturday, most said they
do not suspect foul play in John Kennedy Jr.'s loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in conspiracies, obviously,'' said Robert Groden,
who has written eight publications about his theories on Kennedy's
death. ``But I think this is just a tragic accident.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A small plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife,
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister disappeared late Friday
off the Massachusetts coast, and by Saturday afternoon the
authorities had recovered debris from the airplane off Martha's
Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the debris included part of the plane's landing
gear and a prescription bottle with Carolyn Kennedy's name on it.
Also recovered was a black suitcase with a business card bearing
the name of Lauren G. Bessette, 34, an investment banker for Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter and Kennedy's sister-in-law. The suitcase and
other debris were found on a beach about two miles from the
Martha's Vineyard estate once owned by Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who was piloting the plane, was flying to the wedding
of a cousin, Rory Elizabeth Kennedy, the youngest daughter of
Senator Robert F. Kennedy, in Hyannis Port, Mass. Ms. Kennedy was
to be married yesterday before 275 guests. The wedding was
postponed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard cutters and an Air National Guard helicopter
equipped with an infrared scanning device continued through the
night to search for any survivors from the single-engine plane the
Kennedys were in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not ready to give up on this yet,'' said Rear Adm.
Richard M. Larrabee of the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, a Piper Saratoga owned by Kennedy, left from Essex
County Airport in Fairfield, N.J., at 8:38 p.m. on Friday and was
scheduled to land on Martha's Vineyard about 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration reported that the last
contact with the plane came at 9:39 p.m. when it was 17 miles
southwest of Martha's Vineyard, the Coast Guard said in a
statement. When the plane did not arrive, the Kennedy family
notified the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port Saturday, a white tent
stood by the sea, and a flag at full staff billowed in the breeze.
A Mass was said on the porch of the house of Rory's mother, Ethel
Kennedy, with about 50 family members and three priests praying
``for the safety of the loved ones, as well as for Rory'' and her
fiance, Mark Bailey, said a family spokesman, Brian O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 38, is the only surviving son of John F. Kennedy, the
35th president. He was born on Nov. 25, 1960, weeks after his
father's election, and was known to the nation as ``John-John.''
</P>
<P>
   After his father's assassination, the enduring image from the
funeral came when Kennedy, then a little boy in a blue coat and
shorts, saluted his father's casket outside St. Matthew's Cathedral
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It was his third birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Given his celebrity and pedigree, word of Kennedy's
disappearance touched off an extraordinary reaction, from the
corridors of the White House to the major networks, which broke
into their schedules for live reports from their anchors.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, spending the weekend at Camp David, the
presidential retreat in Maryland, was told about the plane's
disappearance shortly after 7 a.m. Saturday, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   The president called several members of the Kennedy family,
including Kennedy's sister, Caroline Kennedy; his uncle, Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.; and Housing Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo, the
husband of Kerry Kennedy, a sister of Rory Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our prayers and thoughts are with the families of those on
board,'' Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the plane's disappearance remained a mystery
Saturday. Kennedy, who obtained a pilot's license last year, did
not file a flight plan and did not make radio contact with air
controllers during the flight, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the initial search covered a broad swath of the
Eastern Seaboard, from Long Island to Cape Cod. About 3:30 a.m.
Saturday, the Coast Guard received a signal from an emergency
beacon off Long Island, but it proved to be unrelated to the
Kennedy airplane. Later Saturday morning, two boaters found some
debris floating off the Connecticut coast. That, too, was a false
alert.
</P>
<P>
   Other agencies joined the search. The Air National Guard
dispatched a C-130 cargo plane. Fifteen planes from the Civil Air
Patrol were searching, too.
</P>
<P>
   New York Police Commissioner Howard Safir said the Police
Department, acting on a request from the Kennedy family early
Saturday, had dispatched officers to Kennedy's Manhattan apartment
to make sure he was not there.
</P>
<P>
   The search continued along the presumed flight path of Kennedy's
plane, until the discovery of debris off Martha's Vineyard early
Saturday afternoon. That, combined with an analysis of information
captured by air-control radar towers, focused the search efforts
along a 17-mile expanse of water southwest of Martha's Vineyard,
the resort community where Kennedy had planned to drop off Lauren
Bessette before flying on to the wedding at the Kennedy compound.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Another clue came from a man who was fishing on Friday night off
Squibnocket, a rock formation on the southern shore of Martha's
Vineyard. Officer Henry Meyer, of the West Tisbury Police
Department, said the fisherman reported to the police Saturday
morning that he saw a small airplane flying several miles off shore
between 9:30 p.m. and 10 p.m on Friday. The man, a lawyer whom
Meyer refused to identify, said the plane was flying extremely low,
perhaps 40 feet over the water.
</P>
<P>
   On Martha's Vineyard, law enforcement authorities quickly closed
off public access to the beach along Gay Head.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard officials refused to speculate on the fate of the
passengers, and they insisted they had not given up hope. But as
the day wore on, it became clear that hopes of finding survivors
were fading with each passing hour.
</P>
<P>
   Navy salvage experts were consulted. An oceanographic survey
ship, the Rude, was called in to use its sonar equipment to examine
the ocean floor, a rippled plain of fine sand which reaches depths
of up to 100 feet in the search area.
</P>
<P>
   Currents are moderate in the area and should not interfere with
searchers, said John Fish, the president of American Underwater
Search and Survey, a Massachusetts company that searches for sunken
airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board, which
investigates all plane crashes, announced it will conduct an
investigation of the plane's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   The Safety Board sent investigators early Saturday to the
airport in Fairfield and later dispatched investigators to Martha's
Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Bailey, 25, a merchandising analyst and a pilot from Cedar
Grove, N.J., who has flown from the Essex airport for 13 years,
said he saw Kennedy and his wife about 8 p.m. Friday as they walked
toward Kennedy's plane at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said he watched as Kennedy walked around the outside of
the plane and then went through a routine series of preflight
checks. One thing about Kennedy's routine struck Bailey as odd.
Usually pilots take their planes down the runway a bit to do their
engine ``rev-ups,'' to avoid creating too much noise in the parking
area, he said. But he said Kennedy did his rev-ups in the parking
space.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impression I got was maybe there was something wrong with
the plane,'' Bailey said. ``It just caught my attention, like, `Why
is he doing this here?'''
</P>
<P>
   He said Kennedy's plane took off without incident, first heading
south before turning toward Martha's Vineyard. Bailey, who flew to
Martha's Vineyard two weeks ago, said the route over water can be
hazardous, especially at night.
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft like the Piper do not carry flight data recorders or
cockpit voice recorders, the ``black boxes'' that investigators use
to piece together the details of jet crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was flying under visual flight rules, meaning that the
pilot took responsibility for picking his route and avoiding other
traffic, rather than relying on air traffic controllers to guide
the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Though wind conditions were mild on Friday night, visibility in
the area was poor, pilots said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very hazy, and it was very dark, and it was very hard
to see the horizon,'' said Michael C. Bard, a private pilot, who
left Martha's Vineyard about 9:15 p.m. on Friday and flew back to
his home in Danbury, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not instrument rated, it could be difficult
maintaining the airplane in an upright condition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Lorenzo, the owner of Caldwell Flight Academy, which
operates at the Essex airport, said he believed Kennedy was in the
process of getting his instrument license, which allows pilots to
fly in cloudy or bad weather using only instruments.
</P>
<P>
   While his family roots run deep in Boston, Kennedy came of age _
personally and professionally _ in New York City. He grew up with
his mother on Fifth Avenue, and later moved to a loft in TriBeCa.
After graduating from New York University Law School in 1989, he
went to work for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Kennedy was the constant object of media
attention. He was crowned ``The Sexiest Man Alive,'' and
``America's Most Eligible Bachelor.'' The rise and fall of his
romance with the actress Daryl Hannah spilled across the front
pages of the tabloids. When he twice failed his bar examination,
that, too, was front-page news.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a minor miracle, then, that Kennedy managed to marry
Ms. Bessette in 1996 in near secrecy on a secluded island off
Georgia. Ms. Bessette Kennedy, who had worked in public relations
for Calvin Klein, was immediately anointed a ``symbol of American
style,'' by Liz Tilberis, the editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar.
There seemed no limit to the public appetite for gossip about the
couple. Even a quarrel with his wife _ videotaped by a stranger _
was broadcast on television.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Kennedy seemed to have settled into his work as
editor of George, a flashy monthly magazine about politics that he
started in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bessette Kennedy, 33, is a year younger than her sister,
Lauren Bessette, who is a principal in the investment banking
division at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. A graduate of Hobart
College, Ms. Bessette joined the company about six years ago, and
was based in Hong Kong for several years. She has an identical
twin, Lisa.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother, Ann Freeman, a teacher and administrator, and
their stepfather, Dr. Richard Freeman, an orthopedic surgeon, live
in Connecticut. A woman who answered the telephone at their home
declined to comment Saturday. Their father, William Bessette, an
architectural engineer, did not return a telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   In Hyannis Port, a Kennedy wedding became a vigil. Christina
Rivers of Hyannis was to dress the hair of the bridal party before
attending the wedding as a guest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just wonderful over there last night, just exciting,''
Ms. Rivers said. ``It's just not fair.''

Astros prevail after Tigers test Bell's patience
<TEXT>
<P>
   By CARLTON THOMPSON &QL; 
Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   The source of just about everyone's frustration with Derek Bell
has centered on the way he has swung the bat this year. Ironically,
he may have won back some fans Saturday simply by not swinging the
bat at all.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's bases-loaded 10th-inning walk forced home the winning run
in the Astros' 3-2 victory over the Detroit Tigers at the
Astrodome. Bell pumped his fist into the air as he made the
obligatory trot to first base, and the crowd of 41,177 erupted as
Craig Biggio crossed the plate for the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was very satisfying,'' said Bell, who has been a target
of criticism after comments he made about the fans and being
dropped to the sixth spot in the batting order. ``With the game on
the line, my approach was to be patient and get a good pitch to
hit. I never got a good pitch to hit, so I took the walk, and that
was good enough for us to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros completed a three-game sweep of the Tigers and
extended their winning streak to a season-high six games. They
remained in sole possession of first place in the National League
Central, one game ahead of Cincinnati, which defeated Colorado on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians, owners of the best record in baseball,
open a three-game series at the Astrodome beginning today. Having
swept their last two series _ both against American League
competition _ the Astros might be catching the Indians at a good
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we're feeling right now, everyone is positive,''
Astros shortstop Tim Bogar said. ``We're playing a little better,
and our pitching has been great the last six games.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Astros have posted a 3.11 earned run average during
their winning streak, including another solid effort Saturday by
Jose Lima, who allowed two runs in seven innings, and relievers
Doug Henry and Billy Wagner, who combined for three scoreless
innings to close out the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner, battling flu symptoms, struck out three batters over the
final two innings to earn his second win. But it was a former
Astros closer _ Wagner's predecessor, Todd Jones _ who contributed
the finishing touches to this victory.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who entered the game with two outs in the bottom of the
ninth inning, quickly found himself in a mess in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   After Biggio led off with a single, Bill Spiers reached on a
questionable hit toward the mound that should have been fielded by
Jones. Instead, it was the first of back-to-back infield singles;
Jeff Bagwell followed with the other.
</P>
<P>
   Jones nearly escape the jam, striking out Richard Hidalgo and
pinch hitter Jack Howell, but he fell behind in the count to Bell
and eventually walked the Astros' right fielder, who has received
only 27 free passes this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derek doesn't walk much, so it took a lot of restraint,''
Astros manager Larry Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   And, according to Jones, a little help from home-plate umpire
Greg Bonin. Jones took exception with Bonin's call on his 2-0
delivery to Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was (a strike), and so did (catcher) Brad
(Ausmus),'' said Jones, who has allowed nine runs in his last 3
innings against the Astros, dating to last season. ``That changed
the situation obviously, because it's 3-0 instead of 2-1. I got a
break when Hidalgo swung at a 2-0 pitch out of the zone, but I
didn't get a break on Bell.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bagwell said the credit goes to Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great at-bat for Derek,'' the Astros' first baseman
said. ``Obviously, he's had some problems lately swinging at bad
pitches. But he waited for a good one this time, and it paid off.
That's what veterans do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima, who matched a season high with 10 strikeouts, allowed only
two runners to reach scoring position through the first six
innings, but he began to tire in the seventh when the first three
batters he faced reached base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed that I didn't beat the Tigers,'' said Lima,
who was groomed in the Detroit organization. ``But I kept the team
in the game, and we won. That's the most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tigers shortstop Devi Cruz singled home a run in the seventh,
and another scored on a groundout by rookie pitcher Dave Borkowski,
who was making his major-league debut.
</P>
<P>
   Borkowski, who was pitching for Class AAA Toledo against
Pawtucket just six days earlier, fared well in his first extensive
exposure to big-league hitters. He held the Astros scoreless until
solo home runs by Biggio and Bagwell tied the game at 2 in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   That made it possible for Bell to be a hero two innings later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been striking out a lot more than what I want,'' said
Bell, who is hitting .245 and has struck out an NL-high 95 times.
``When I pumped my fist in the air, that was for the fans. It was
very satisfying to see the signs and having them cheer for me.
Houston is a great city, and I want to finish my career here, but
that's out of my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The bat may as well have been out of Bell's hands in the 10th
inning. But as he proved Saturday, sometimes it's not necessary for
a hitter to take his hacks to deliver in the clutch.
