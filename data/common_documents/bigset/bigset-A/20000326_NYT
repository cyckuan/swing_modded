 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
Ricky Calloway figured it was time to speak up.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Calloway had read and heard former Indiana University basketball
player Neil Reed's accusations of abuse at the hands of Hoosiers
coach Bob Knight, and he knew what was going to happen next.
</P>
<P>
   The wall of silence would go up, and people would bend over
backward to defend Knight and discredit Reed, who in 1997
transferred from Indiana to Southern Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with CNN/Sports Illustrated, Reed claimed Knight
had choked him during a practice session, prompting a hail of
denials from former Hoosiers players and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Other than saying he didn't remember choking Reed, Knight has
refused comment on the incident. Knight is currently away on a
hunting trip.
</P>
<P>
   Calloway, who started as a sophomore on Indiana's 1987 national
championship team, claims tales like Reed's are true. And seeing
Reed vilified for his comments prompted Calloway, who transferred
to Kansas for his senior year, to break a 12-year silence on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah, I've seen things (physical abuse) like that
myself,'' said Calloway, who now runs a swimming-pool construction
company, Red Sea Pool Services, in Houston. ``He (Reed) didn't
deserve to have all that stuff heaped on him. Everybody says he's
lying about all the abuse at Indiana, but he's not. It took a lot
of courage for him to come forward like he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see Neil Reed get choked, but I can be 95 percent
sure it happened because I've seen it happen (to other players). I
saw a lot of things happen. And with him (Knight), if you're going
to keep getting away with things like that, why would you change?''
</P>
<P>
   For years there have been whispers of a dark side to Knight, but
as the only active coach with three NCAA titles to his credit, he
holds tremendous sway in college and professional circles. His
Indiana program produced University of Iowa coach Steve Alford and
Bowling Green coach Dan Dakich, and NBA coaches Butch Carter
(Toronto) and Randy Wittman (Cleveland). Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski
played for Knight at Army.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last five years, nine players _ including several
highly regarded recruits _ have transferred from Indiana, including
Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Calloway did, too, leaving the program in 1988, saying he could
``no longer take all the stuff he was giving me and the other
players.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm not some bitter ex-player with shattered dreams,''
Calloway said. ``I made it to the NBA (playing one season with
Sacramento in 1991). I didn't play as long as I wanted, but I got
there. And I had a good career playing overseas (Turkey, France,
Greece and Poland) and in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ``But some things just have to be said.''
</P>
<P>
   Calloway said he recalled two specific incidents of physical
abuse: Knight punching Alford, his star guard, and once slapping
forward Darryl Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah, I've seen him hit players,'' Calloway said. ``I saw
him punch Steve Alford. I saw him slap Darryl Thomas. I've seen him
threaten players. He got nose to nose with me one time saying that
he wanted to fight me, and I knew right then that it was time to go
because it had reached a point where I wanted him to hit me so I
could have a reason to hit him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach knew the guys he could hit or really get into, and those
he couldn't. Darryl was a big guy (6-7, 240 pounds), but coach knew
what type of personality Darryl had. He (Knight) was mad at him,
and Darryl was sitting in his chair, and he (Knight) just came up
and slapped him, and it was hard. Then he realized what he did and
said, `Go ahead and hit me back.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, he realized what he did was all wrong, so he knew he had
to try and correct it by telling Darryl to hit him back. But Darryl
hit him real soft, and I remember when we got back to the dorm room
we were like, `Man, you should have hit him hard. You've been here
for four years, and he's been kicking your butt the whole time, and
you just tap him?' But (Knight) knew Darryl wasn't going to hit him
back.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Calloway said, neither was Alford.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all felt sorry for Steve,'' Calloway said. ``After practice
one day he (Knight) was mad. And Alford used to take a lot for
other people because he (Knight) would tell Alford that everything
that went wrong was his fault because he didn't get on us enough.
He would say, `(former Hoosier) Quinn Buckner would have slapped
one of these guys.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always going off on Steve like that, trying to get him
to be like Buckner, but Steve just wasn't like that. We were all
standing in a circle one day, and he (Knight) just turned around
and punched Steve right in the stomach, and for a minute and a half
Steve couldn't breathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked. I wasn't really surprised he hit someone, but I
never expected him to hit Steve, his golden child. But Steve put up
with a lot. He really had to put up with a lot. Steve won't admit
that it happened, but he won't lie about it, either. He just
doesn't answer the question. He gets evasive when you ask him about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Calloway wants to make it clear he has no vendetta against
Knight. He would have remained silent on the subject had Reed not
spoken out. Calloway, a highly recruited 6-6 forward out of Withrow
High in Cincinnati back in 1985 _ more highly regarded than a 6-7
forward out of Michigan named Glen Rice _ in fact says his initial
impressions of Indiana were good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went there (to Indiana) because I wanted to go to a
top-notch program and I wanted to play for a good coach,'' Calloway
said. ``And one of the biggest things was that all of the other
schools that recruited tried to do that with a suitcase full of
money. And promises. I knew all that was b.s. I didn't want to be a
piece of meat for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Knight) was the only coach who came to my house and said,
`Look, whatever you get you'll earn. I guarantee you'll be a better
basketball player when you're through here. And we'll be on TV
every week.' I could respect that. I just didn't know it was going
to turn into three years of hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Calloway is certain Knight felt he was simply testing his
players, but feels it often went too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he didn't want to do it himself, he would try to get a
player to hit another player,'' Calloway said of Knight. ``If you
were the captain and you were going to the locker room after
practice or after a game, he would pull you out and tell you,
`Look, you need to go in there and slap Ricky upside his head and
tell him he's playing like .'
</P>
<P>
   ``And he actually wanted you to hit that player. I wouldn't do
it, which was a big problem between him and me.''
</P>
<P>
   And Calloway dismissed the notion that he could not play for a
strict coach, citing Kansas coach Roy Williams as one of the
toughest he has ever had to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK to be tough on players, but without physical abuse,''
said Calloway, who graduated from Kansas in 1990. ``And it wasn't
like I couldn't handle a tough coach. I went to Kansas after that,
and coach Williams' practices were actually harder than at Indiana.
Man, at Kansas we worked hard. Coach Williams was on us _ he was
tough. But he also built us up instead of putting you down.
</P>
<P>
   ``And at that age, when someone is constantly telling you that
you're no good and you'll never be anything, then you start to
believe it. There is no positive at all at Indiana, and I don't
think the ends justify the means. Look at (the program) now.
They're going to make the (NCAA) Tournament, but when was the last
time anyone thought they had a legitimate chance to win it all?
Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the players are no longer responding to all that stuff
he (Knight) does. They're just not responding. It got to the point
on our team where we just wanted the season to be over. It was
like, if we win, we win. If we don't, then we don't. We could
finish out the school year and go on about our business.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana president Myles Brand on Thursday initiated an
investigation of Reed's charge, with the findings to be reported to
him in 90 days. Calloway said a professor at the same university
wouldn't get the same consideration from the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is that if a professor at Indiana did the things he
(Knight) does, he'd get fired,'' Calloway said. ``In a minute. If a
parent did the abusive things he does, they'd take the kid away. Or
if a spouse did stuff like that, hitting his wife, then he has to
go. No questions asked. But with him (Knight), everybody's telling
a lie. Everybody just has to be lying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to let other kids know that if you're not happy
and things aren't going the way you want them to go, you can always
leave. You don't have to be there. You don't have to take abuse. If
something was happening to my daughter, I wouldn't want her to just
sit there and be abused, either physically or verbally. But he
(Knight) thinks that's OK, but it's not.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to go too far one day, and he's going to hurt a
kid. Or a kid is going to hurt him. It'll be like (former Ohio
State football coach) Woody Hayes, where he loses control and
smacks a kid in public, right on national TV. Then everyone will
know what's been going on all these years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it'll be too late by then.''

SUTTON'S TPC LEAD GETS WATER-DOWNED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ Hal Sutton was throwing the
third-round challenge back in the face of Tiger Woods Saturday
until he came to the question that demanded the shortest answer.
</P>
<P>
   Then he blinked, delivering a three-quarter 9-iron that flew
past the pin, hopped just once, and came to rest with the fishes,
the ducks, and all the heartache that resides in the water
surrounding the island green at TPC Sawgrass's 17th hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was too long,'' said Sutton, after the
triple-bogey 6 on the 145-yard hole turned what should have been a
spectacular round into his third straight 3-under-par 69. That he
is at 9-under 207 and in possession of the lead in The Players
Championship is something to take heart in. That he allowed Woods
(66_208) to get within one shot is something to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   The question burned Sutton more than the shot he fired into the
water at 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no winning in this conversation, is there?'' he said,
knowing that the world probably thinks he may as well be eight
shots behind Woods entering Sunday's final round. He had made the
point earlier in the week that Woods was great but not unbeatable,
and now he goes head-to-head with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is No. 1 in the world, so I don't want to start anything,
but he is one shot down right now,'' said Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   True enough, but a short time before speaking those words,
Sutton had led by four shots, having countered Woods's best shots
with even better ones.
</P>
<P>
   A birdie on the opening hole by Woods set the agenda. Sutton
made one, too, so take that.
</P>
<P>
   Four birdies and a 32 on the front by Woods. No problem,
shrugged Sutton, who casually ripped off five and shot 31.
</P>
<P>
   How about an eagle for Woods at the par-5 11th, set up by an
eye-opening 4-iron out of a fairway bunker from 211 yards? Big
deal, yawned Sutton, who made his sixth birdie of the day at the
par-4 12th and built his lead back to four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to answer everything that he did,'' said Sutton,
who was two groups behind Woods. ``I am not going to roll over and
play dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the field did not share that approach. On a day when
Sawgrass was open for attack (the field average was 72.436, nearly
four shots easier than Thursday) only Tom Lehman and Jeff Sluman,
besides Sutton and Woods, shifted into forward.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman is alone in third, though his 72_211 left a bittersweet
taste thanks to a double-bogey at 18. He had one of the field's 11
birdies at 17 to get to 7 under, but drove it into the hay down the
right on 18 and had to lay up. An indifferent wedge fell short of
the green, and Lehman needed a chip and two putts to stumble in.
</P>
<P>
   Sluman, proving that Sawgrass can be played by those who don't
hit it into the next area code, shared the day's best round (66)
and leapfrogged 19 players into sole possession of fourth at
4-under 212.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Azinger had the shot of the day: a hole-in-one on No. 17
that helped him finish at 2 under for the day and the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But other than that, it was a leaderboard that refused to take
advantage of ideal scoring conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Uresti, one behind Sutton at the start, made a triple bogey
at the par-4 10th and wasn't noticed again until he hit two into
the water at 17. His 80 dropped him to 28th.
</P>
<P>
   Woods's playing partner, Len Mattiace, was four shots behind to
start the day and made the turn in 33. But he hit his second shot
into the water at the 535-yard 11th, made bogey, then hit in the
water on the par-3 13th. He shot 73 and fell to 12th.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest fall belonged to Fulton Allem, who showed why
you haven't heard of him since that World Series of Golf win in
1993. Allem doubled the par-4 fourth, made the turn in 40, then
made three more doubles in an incoming nine to complete an 82 that
pushed him to 60th.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton and Woods were able to avoid letting such miserable play
sidetrack them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the course was going to be playing a little bit more
benign,'' said Woods, ``and I could be a little more aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Right out of the gate, too, as he bombed a drive on the 392-yard
opening hole and had a 60-degree wedge left. He made birdie there,
then two-putted for birdie on the par-5 second to give Sutton
something to look at.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, said Sutton: ``I am very confident. I feel real
good about what I am doing.''
</P>
<P>
   It showed, too. Starting at the fifth, Sutton made five birdies
in eight holes to get to 12 under. By the time he walked off the
16th green, Sutton had played a stretch of 25 holes without a bogey
and owned a four-shot lead despite Woods throwing six birdies and
an eagle at him.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the diabolical 17th. ``I didn't think I overplayed the
shot,'' said Sutton, who had made par and bogey the first two days.
``I was aimed 6 feet left . . .'' Which is about the line it was
on. Only it carried farther than Sutton had expected.
</P>
<P>
   He took the drop, but his third shot hit a slope in the green,
spun back against the collar and required Sutton to negotiate a
difficult chip, which he could not pull off.
</P>
<P>
   That challenge passed, the question was directed to his next
one. Sutton glared, took a deep breath, and answered slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, this is what you dream about being in,'' he said.
``I am glad I am in the last group playing with Tiger Woods.''
</P>
<P>
   If only the one-shot lead was four.

SUTTON HAUNTED BY TRIP TO TERROR ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, FLA. _ On a day when they combined for 135
swings in the third round of The Players Championship, Hal Sutton
and Tiger Woods were asked specifically about just two of them.
What resulted from these shots explained the contrast in their
moods.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Sutton's 9-iron to the 145-yard 17th island green Saturday
was a shot that melted a four-shot cushion down to one. It was a
good shot with a miserable result, said a somber Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put a good swing on it and the ball just stayed in the air a
long time,'' he said, of the shot that hit behind the pin and
splashed into the lagoon. It led to a triple-bogey, but no second
thoughts. ``I don't know that I would have done it any differently.
Pitching wedge wasn't the right club.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Woods's second shot out of a fairway bunker into the
535-yard 11th hole? He was 200 yards from the front of the green,
211 to the pin _ the perfect distance for his 5-iron. ``But there
was too much sand,'' said Woods, who switched to a 4-iron.
</P>
<P>
   No problem. ``It came out absolutely perfect, just a nice, high
fade, about 4 or 5 yards. It hit nice and soft and I made the
putt.''
</P>
<P>
   Could anyone else have hit that shot, Woods was asked, and
before he could respond, the answer came from a reporter standing
nearby: ``God.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Woods laughed, but he said that the shot ``ranks up there''
with his greatest, a list that is already lengthy at the age of 24.
``I had to throw it up there pretty high and I wouldn't figure a
lot of guys could hit that, just because of the fact you have to
have clubhead speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget clubhead speed, Sutton wishes he had blinders for the
17th tee. He watched Omar Uresti hit into the water, the third
straight day he had seen a playing partner do that. ``That doesn't
give you positive vibes,'' said Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad he hadn't hit behind Paul Azinger, who aced the hole
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Uresti made things even more uncomfortable by taking his drop
and depositing that in the water. (He would make seven on the
hole.) Sutton then took his drop. He punched a sand wedge in the
direction he wanted, right in the middle of the green where there's
a crest, but ``it was just a foot or 2 short.'' Instead of
funneling toward the hole, the ball rolled back and came to rest
against thick, wiry rough that was taller than the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton stood there, bidding farewell to his four-shot lead and
wondering what to do next. He asked for an official when he spotted
a small television microphone buried in the rough, but there was a
deeper motive involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was biding for some time, trying to figure out the shot to
play,'' said Sutton, who won this event in 1983, back when he
wasn't nearly the player he is now. ``I mean, I was hollering
`uncle' the whole time and couldn't get away from the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   His options were to putt the ball or to try and chip it with
anything from a 3-wood to a sand wedge. He chose a putter. ``I had
to hit down on the ball (to pop it through the fringe), and I could
easily, if I had been too aggressive, have putted that ball across
the green in the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it came up well short, leaving Sutton 20- to 25-feet
for his fifth shot. He missed that putt, ``but the beauty of that
was I was able to tap in and finally finish the hole,'' he said,
trying his best to keep his sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Then he gathered himself and put on the Sutton stare. If not for
Woods, it perhaps would be the most intimidating in golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obviously deflating,'' he said, ``and I'd like to have
the four-shot lead back. It was a triple-bogey, but it wasn't the
end of the world because I had (shots) to give back. That is why I
had to accept it and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Is the challenge Sunday to prove the point he had made earlier
in the week, that when he plays his game he can beat Woods? Again,
the stern, focused look.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only point I really want to make is driving it in the
fairway on the first hole (Sunday),'' said Sutton. ``I will start
trying to make my points after that.''

MICHIGAN STATE REACHES FINAL FOUR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ Iowa State's dream season ended Saturday
in a torrent of intensity and thrills, and so did the tournament
field's best chance.
</P>
<P>
   For if the tough, talented and superbly coached Cyclones could
not repel Michigan State with a six-point lead and five minutes to
play, what chance does anyone else have?
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't anything we did wrong, it was the opponent,'' said
Iowa State coach Larry Eustachy. ``I think they're the best team in
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State qualified for its second consecutive Final Four
with a 75-64 victory Saturday before 21,214 partisan fans at The
Palace,which stands just 80 miles from MSU's campus in Lansing. The
Spartans will face Big Ten foe Wisconsin, champion of the West -
and a team they defeated three times this season - in one semifinal
in the RCA Dome in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   But before focusing on the surprising Badgers, Michigan State
(30-7) will spend a few hours relishing Saturday's awesome
performance. In perhaps the best game of the tournament - and
certainly the most intense - the Spartans outscored Iowa State 20-3
in the final five minutes, turning a 61-55 deficit into the
11-point victory that was far closer than the score indicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the most incredible game I've been involved in since
I've been at Michigan State,'' said Spartans coach Tom Izzo, who
has been there (in various capacities) for 17 years. ``Those guys
reached down and found something.''
</P>
<P>
   The second half featured several surges by each team. The
Cyclones built an eight-point lead with 12 minutes remaining,
watched the Spartans slice it to one, then darted to a seven-point
advantage when Izzo was assessed a technical foul for excessive
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some coaches know when to get (technicals) and some don't,''
Spartans guard Mateen Cleaves said. ``Since we won, I think it was
a good time to get the tech.''
</P>
<P>
   Izzo's emotion energized his players, who scored 23 of the
next28 points and held Iowa State star Marcus Fizer scoreless for
the final five minutes. The signature play was an alley-oop from
Cleaves, the All-American point guard, to Morris Peterson, the
All-American small forward, following a timeout with 2:17
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson's dunk gave Michigan State a 64-61 lead, initiated Iowa
State's demise and showed why the Spartans are indeed the team to
beat in Indianapolis. They are tough, well-drilled, big, deep,
experienced and talented, and they execute their offense in
pressure situations better than any team in the country. Saturday,
they scored on nine of their last 10 possessions against the same
Cyclones defense that snuffed UCLA's fun-and-gun attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a great example of how they execute,'' Eustachy said.
``We went over that play and went over that play and broke down.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played better quality basketball in the last five
minutes, and that's why they're going to the Final Four. I don't
want to put pressure on their coach, but they're the best team in
the country. Butthat doesn't mean they'll win the national
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   There were several questionable calls against the Cyclones, and
with nine seconds remaining and the game out of reach, Eustachy -
who's wound Titleist tight on a good day received two technical

</P>
<P>
   It was a fitting end to an intense, dramatic game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might say it's unfair for these two great teams to meet in
the regional finals,'' Cyclones guard Michael Nurse said. ``But
that's the pick of the draw.''

   Unfortunately.

REVOLUTION IMPRESSIVE IN LOSS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TAMPA _ The Revolution delivered one of the most impressive
offensive performances in their five-year history Saturday &UR;  &LR; night,
but they wasted several excellent chances and fell, 1-0, to the
Tampa Bay Mutiny.
</P>
<P>
   After a chaotic and sloppy start, the Revolution dictated the
tempo, and dominated the midfield by keeping Carlos Valderrama
under control. But the game was decided when the Mutiny's Raul Diaz
Arce headed in a Steve Ralston cross in the 51st minute, Tampa
Bay's only good opportunity of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution pressured Tampa Bay's goal with strikers Wolde
Harris and Eduardo Hurtado, but they failed to convert _ because of
their own inaccuracy and Scott Garlick's goaltending.
</P>
<P>
   ``They dominated the second half,'' Diaz Arce said. ``They are
going to be a strong team this year. But it was a game that was
very close. It was the kind of game where one goal was going to
make the difference, and they paid the price of giving up that one
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution were far from perfect. But they were alternately
adventurous and patient offensively, maintaining their composure
and concluding the match on the offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time we lose, I am going to be mad,'' Revolution coach
Fernando Clavijo said. ``But I cannot be mad after that. We did
everything we needed to do to win. We just didn't put the ball in
the back of the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are becoming better as a team. Everyone gave everything
they had and we were the better team, but they won the game. We won
every ball in midfield and didn't give them any room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody should be discouraged after a game like that. It was
just one of those times that no matter what you do, the ball is not
going to go in. We can build on this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution, which have earned one point in two games,
continue their road trip to Los Angeles Saturday and Dallas April
8. But this was indeed a moral victory, since Tampa Bay had
expected to dominate this contest after taking a 5-1 victory over
Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have seldom maintained possession and pressured
the opposing goal in such a clinical manner. Mauricio Ramos
improved his midfield choreography as the game continued, spraying
accurate and efficient passes to the wings. Leonel Alvarez and John
Harkes blocked Valderrama and ignited the offense in transition.
And Imad Baba was stopped twice by excellent reaction saves by
Garlick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the players to dictate the way we are going to play,''
Clavijo said. ``But we have eight new players and they still have
to get to know each other better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution forced the tempo and kept the Mutiny on the
defensive for much of the match, seldom allowing Valderrama to get
into the flow. Hurtado had the best opportunity of the first half,
efficiently trapping a cross from Baba in the penalty area, but
then skying a left-footed drive from 15 yards in the 34th minute.
They had several excellent shots in the second half, concluding
with Ramos's hooking attempt from just outside the penalty area
that was tipped over the bar by Garlick in the 89th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz Arce made the difference as he headed over Mike Burns, a
second-half replacement for Ted Chronopoulos, who suffered a
strained back in a collision with Chad McCarty.
</P>
<P>
   William Sunsing gave the Revolution another weapon in the final
minutes, entering as a substitute for defender Ivan McKinley as the
Revolution switched to a 3-5-2 alignment for the final 20 minutes.
But Sunsing, who returned early in the morning after playing for
Costa Rica in Morocco, lost possession on his first two touches and
needed time to get into the rhythm.

GOLDEN GOPHERS TURN BACK BROWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For the first time in the history of the sport, the
best women's college ice hockey team in America is not from the
East.
</P>
<P>
   Striking for two rapid-fire goals in the third period, the
University of Minnesota upset No. 1-ranked Brown, 4-2,
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night in front of 2,249 at Matthews Arena to win the
American Women's College Hockey Alliance national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still hasn't sunk in,'' said a stunned Laura Halldorson as
her team celebrated around her. ``Three weeks ago, we weren't sure
we were going to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Minnesota made good use of the at-large bid it got after
losing the Western Collegiate Hockey Association tournament to
upstart Minnesota-Duluth. Leading, 2-1, going into the third
period, the Golden Gophers put the game out of reach when Nadine
Muzerall, trying to ignore the neck injury suffered in a scary fall
during practice Thursday, scored her nation-leading 49th goal of
the season at 3:43, followed 58 seconds later by a high blast
through the legs of the country's top goaltender, Ali Brewer. The
1-2 punch gave Minnesota a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great lead to get and we just relied on Killer to get
it done,'' said Halldorson. Her goaltender, junior Erica Killewald,
was named the tournament's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   Although a flying rebounder by Kristy Zamora at 13:05 cut the
gap, Brown couldn't fight all the way back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the well ran dry,'' said Brown coach Digit
Murphy, whose Bears won the Ivy League, ECAC regular-season, and
ECAC tournament crowns. ``You look at the bright spots. How can you
be disappointed when you lose four games all year?'' Brown finishes
at 25-4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Not since their first game of the season Nov. 5, in a 4-0 loss
to this same Minnesota team, had Brown and Brewer been tapped for
four goals.
</P>
<P>
   There was some doubt that Brown could match Minnesota's physical
style, especially with Olympic defenseman Tara Mounsey out after
ACL surgery. But the Bears started strong, and drew first blood at
17:18 when sophomore defenseman Emily Sigman, out of Milton
Academy, rocketed a pass from the far edge of the faceoff circle to
freshman center Kim Insalaco, who one-timed it up the middle to put
Brown up, 1-0, for the period.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bears seemed to hit a lull in the second period, and a
Woburn-to-Minnesota family act took advantage when Courtney
Kennedy, a junior defenseman, got the puck from her sister Shannon,
a senior left wing, and sneaked it past Brewer head-on to tie the
game, 1-1, at 4:47.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't get any better than this,'' said Shannon Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Kennedy figured in the next goal, as well, earning
credit for an assist after Laura Slominski bounced the puck off of
Brewer's chest and into the net during a flurry with 1:11 left in
the second, putting the Gophers up, 2-1, at the second break.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Bears missed Mounsey, Murphy shrugged. ``If I had
her it may have been the difference, but we really felt we could
beat them without her.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Brown lost the Feb. 19 game against Harvard in which
Mounsey tore her ACL, it had gone 9-0 since.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota and Brown are the only teams that have been invited to
the tournament all three years of its existence, and the coaches
are such close friends that Halldorson is the godmother of Murphy's
six-month-old son, Sean. Brown has never won, while the Gophers
finished fourth, third, and now first. Asked how she would some day
explain to Sean why she beat his mother for the national
championship, she smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm competitive,'' she said softly.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the consolation game, Carly Haggard scored on breakaways
twice in less than a minute near the end of the game to lead
Dartmouth to a 5-4 come-from-behind win over the University of
Minnesota-Duluth for the right to call itself the No. 3 team in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know she's a go-to player,'' said coach Judy Oberting of
Haggard, a freshman left wing from British Columbia whose
third-period hat trick included her sixth game-winning goal of the
season. ``She doesn't mind the pressure. She'll just keep getting
better and better.''

ST. CLOUD CAN'T KEEP UP WITH TERRIERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Having grown up on Third Street in South Boston
and having skated since he was 14 months old at the MDC rink on Day
Boulevard, it's a given that Jack Baker is a tough hockey player.
But it's also a given that Baker is _ by his own account _ ``maybe
5-7 and maybe 163 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   So when the Boston University hockey team became vulnerable
Saturday in the second period after racing to a 3-0 first-period
lead against St. Cloud State in an NCAA East Regional game, Baker
made the play that kept the Terriers in control.
</P>
<P>
   With the score 3-1 midway through the middle period, the
Fabulous Baker Boy threw his body at a one-timer from the blue line
by a St. Cloud defenseman (``I got it with my stick . . .
luckily''), then got to his feet as linemate Carl Corazzini
collected the puck and blew around the St. Cloud defense. Baker
caught up to the action and drove home the rebound of Corazzini's
shot for the key goal in BU's 5-3 win over the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   If the Terriers can beat St. Lawrence Sunday, they'll be more
than CYO champs. They'll be headed to the NCAA's Frozen Four next
weekend in Providence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had just scored a goal and we always try to come back as
fast as we can to get another goal,'' said Baker. ``We try to get
another one as quick as we can to kill any momentum they have.''
</P>
<P>
   In that second period, said BU coach Jack Parker, ``all of a
sudden we were back on our heels a little bit and they got a goal
and, all of a sudden, we were a little jumpy.'' But Baker's huge
defensive play, followed by his goal, Parker continued, ``were huge
for us. They were great answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker and Corazzini are known for their speed, a trait of most
BU teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to imagine somebody faster than Carl
Corazzini,'' said Parker, ``but then it's hard for me to imagine
somebody faster than (former Terrier) Shawn McEachern and somebody
faster than Tony Amonte (another ex-BU star).''
</P>
<P>
   And that speed whiplashed St. Cloud early as Corazzini opened
the scoring with an unassisted goal at 2:35 of the first. Next,
Baker banged home his first goal of the game from a difficult angle
as his shot went in off the helmet of St. Cloud defenseman Derek
Eastman at 9:19. Then, at 15:39, Mike Pandolfo gave BU a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not the biggest line and a lot of teams try to
intimidate us by laying the body on us,'' said Baker. ``But a
majority of time we're able to get free and use the speed to our
advantage. We're usually able to break free against the line
playing against us, and if we're not scoring goals, we're at least
creating a lot of chances or putting some fear in the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   But BU fizzled early in the second period and St. Cloud
responded as defenseman Mike Pudlick banged home a one-timer from
the right faceoff circle at 12:22. BU seemed shaky, until Baker's
huge play just over a minute later.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got the draw back and they were trying to set up for a
one-timer,'' said Baker. ``I just got out there and laid down to
block the shot and it hit my stick and just sort of died. Carl was
able to pick it up and break down the wing and beat them wide and I
just tried to get back in the play. Carl just hit it off the goalie
and the puck was just sitting there and I was able to slam it in.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was BU's after that, as the Terriers smothered a St.
Cloud power play that covered the final 13 seconds of the second
period and the opening 1:47 of the third, the Huskies failing to
register a shot on goalie Rick DiPietro. St. Cloud was only 1 for 9
on power plays, compared with BU's 1 for 3. ``Our special teams
play was very good,'' said Parker.
</P>
<P>
   The Terriers had come out with their A game in the first period
``because we were terrible against Maine in the Hockey East
semifinals,'' said Corazzini. ``That's why we came out with a lot
of pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, BU, after a rare absence from the NCAA tournament last
year, is back in familiar territory.

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The University of North Dakota, after a couple of
seasons of frustrating finishes, is back in the Frozen Four.
</P>
<P>
   The Fighting Sioux upended Niagara, 4-1, Saturday &UR;  &LR; night to
become the first team booked for Providence. North Dakota (29-8-5)
will take on the winner of Sunday's Michigan-Maine game in an April
6 semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly going to be good to get back to the Final Four
after three years of not getting there,'' said North Dakota coach
Dean Blais.
</P>
<P>
   The Purple Eagles (30-8-4), in the program's fourth year, gave
North Dakota all it could handle. The Fighting Sioux jumped on top,
2-0, in the first period on goals by Ryan Bada at 3:11 and Mike
Commodore with 54 seconds left. But Niagara goalie Greg Gardner
made 17 saves in the middle frame and John Heffernan scored on the
power play at 12:13.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second period was a fun one to coach and watch,'' said
Niagara coach Blaise MacDonald. ``But then we gave up the goal
early in the third, and I think that broke our spirit a little.''
</P>
<P>
   The spirit-breaking goal came at 1:05 off the stick of Lee
Goren, converting a nice pass from Jeff Panzer.

BADGERS CRASH PAST PURDUE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE _ You say there is no recorded instance of a town
ever actually being drunk dry? There's a first time for everything,
and that time might be next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Load up on the brewskis. Board up the windows. Wisconsin is
coming to Indianapolis. That's Wisconsin, as in state of.
Wisconsin, as in state of mind. That's Wisconsin, as in the
partyingest people north of Bourbon Street. And Wisconsin, as in
University of, a school whose rampaging basketball team has rolled
into the Final Four _ 13 losses, No. 8 seed and all _ by virtue of
a 64-60 victory over Big Ten rival Purdue in Saturday's West
Regional final.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these kids can play this game and study it. ``Us being
an 8 seed,'' said forward Mark Vershaw, ``I hope we repeat '85 and
do what Villanova did.''
</P>
<P>
   Rare is a kid who knows his hoop history, but if you were ever
going to find one, Madison, Wis., is probably a good place to
start. Vershaw really did come to Madison for an education. Like
his teammates, he knows that when his four seasons of collegiate
eligibility are up, his basketball will be over. But he now has a
Final Four on his resume, while several future NBA millionaires
will be watching him and his buddies play next Saturday evening in
the RCA Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin got there the usual Wisconsin way, by playing kung fu
defense and by each man remembering who he is and why he's here
when the ball is in his hands. Wisconsin had to survive a very
un-Badgerlike first half in which it had an unacceptable 2-1 ratio
of shots attempted (21) to turnovers. But the Badgers' defense
enabled them to squeeze out a 31-28 lead.
</P>
<P>
   As everyone had expected, the teams were evenly matched, and so
it was that with 5:23 remaining the teams were tied at 52. Purdue's
Brian Cardinal, scoreless in the first half, had just scored 11 of
his team's last 13 points to rescue the Boilermakers from a 45-39
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   That's when second-half hero Roy Boone (12 off the bench)
penetrated and dropped one down to forward Andy Kowske for a layup
that broke the final tie. The Badgers really needed only one more
big hoop, and that was provided by Boone, whose 12-footer in the
lane made it 56-53 with 2:49 left. Purdue never got closer again,
although Wisconsin made it dicier than it should have been with
some shaky foul shooting (13 for 24).
</P>
<P>
   Wily Wisconsin coach Dick Bennett can usually count on his team
taking care of business at the defensive end. But even pesky
Badgers need to score every once in a while.
</P>
<P>
   There were two critical offensive spurts. The first came at the
beginning of the game, when regional MVP Jon Bryant came off three
classic Kowske screens to drill 3-pointers for Wisconsin's first 9
points.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin, which isn't built to come from behind, must have a
good start.
</P>
<P>
   The second key offensive phase came early in the second half.
Purdue had scored the first 4 points to regain the lead at 33-32,
even as the Badgers missed two easy shots in their first two
possessions. But Wisconsin then scored on nine of its next 11
possessions over the next eight minutes, leaving itself with a
49-46 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was worried they might come out on fire,'' confessed
Bennett. ``I was worried; there's no question about that. Then we
started getting into the lane and getting good looks. It coincided
with us going to three guards by bringing Boone into the game. We
ran our offense better there than in any part of the game, and that
almost carried us to the wire.''
</P>
<P>
   It was no Monet, but Wisconsin games _ and Wisconsin-Purdue
games in particular _ never are. Wisconsin turned it over on six of
its first 15 and 10 of its first 24 possessions, and not all of the
turnovers were forced.
</P>
<P>
   But the good news for Wisconsin was that it was limiting Purdue,
which had scored 23 second-chance points against Gonzaga, to one
shot while scoring some bonus points itself.
</P>
<P>
   It is, truly, a fairy tale story. Wisconsin finished sixth in
the Big Ten. Vershaw (12 ppg) is the only double-figure scorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I think some people who really understand basketball
appreciate us,'' said point guard Mike Kelley, ``the majority of
people don't understand how we play or why we do it. Now they can
see it's all about winning.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the tips about to come their way, Wisconsin bartenders
will soon be retiring to the Bahamas.

   RICHMOND _ The question no longer is will the University of
Connecticut beat its opponent, but by how many points. It's not
whether the Huskies will win, but how much damage they will do.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, it was the University of Oklahoma's turn to feel the
pain.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1-ranked and top-seeded Huskies rolled over the Sooners,
102-80, in an NCAA East Regional semifinal before 5,702 at Virginia
Commonwealth's Siegel Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies (33-1) have won 14 straight games and move on to
face Louisiana State in the East final Monday night. LSU, which is
making only its second trip to the Elite Eight, defeated Duke,
79-66, Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   UConn will be playing in its sixth regional final in seven years
after cracking the 100-point barrier for the ninth time this
season.
</P>
<P>
   So coach Geno Auriemma should be ecstatic, right?
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   He's not satisfied, and he won't let his players be satisfied,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, they haven't done anything yet,'' Auriemma said,
shrugging off yet another blowout. ``All they've done is win a
bunch of regular-season games. But they can't be satisfied, because
if you're a competitor you want to win the national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma (25-8), the No. 5 seed, had a brief lead when a
3-pointer by Phylesha Whaley, followed by a layup by guard Stacy
Dales, put the Sooners up, 9-6, with 16:53 to go in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough for the Huskies, who went into attack mode with
an 18-0 run. They slammed the door shut, taking a 57-42 lead at
halftime that grew to 25 points before the game was over.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomores Tamika Williams and Asjha Jones came off the bench to
lead the Huskies with 16 points each as three of their teammates
also scored in double figures.
</P>
<P>
   Whaley, who played her final college game, led all scorers with
24 points.
</P>
<P>
   But with its trademark pressure UConn turned up the heat, making
21 steals and forcing 33 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a whole lot I can say that wasn't evident by how
we played,'' said Auriemma. ``We knew this would be a difficult
game to win, so I'm happy that we took control early.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn forward Svetlana Abrosimova, who finished with 15 points
and four assists, is obviously a top student in the Auriemma school
of winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's how we play all the time, we don't look up at the
scoreboard and see we're up by 20 and stop playing,'' she said.
Anyway, she kept in mind that LSU was down by 17 to Purdue last
week but came back to win.
</P>
<P>
   Huskies guard Shea Ralph (10 points, eight assists) also isn't
satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always room for improvement, we didn't play perfect
tonight,'' she said, as her coach, seated next to her, said,
``rebounds,'' in a whisper. Oklahoma pulled down 40 boards to
Connecticut's 29. ``We have to concentrate to play our A game.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma coach Sherri Coale said the disappointment of loss was
tempered by the opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it goes without saying that we got beat by the best
team in the country,'' she said, comparing the Huskies' assault to
a tidal wave. ``They have this continuous wave attacking you, and
we don't have that kind of depth, so it's hard to survive those
waves.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, Coale said, she's ready to watch UConn move on and
victimize someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Geno doesn't win it all, I'll be really mad at him now,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the other East Regional semifinal, Duke, which lost three
starters off last year's national championship runner-up team to
graduation, came up short.
</P>
<P>
   The teams seesawed the entire first half as Louisiana State
(25-6) clogged the lane and made Duke take outside shots. Forward
Lauren Rice was held to 10 points on 4-for-9 shooting as the Blue
Devils (28-6) shot 35 percent in the half.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the cold shooting, Duke had a 1-point lead, 31-30,
at the break and went up, 43-36, with 14:43 remaining. But LSU took
over from there. Junior guard Marie Ferdinand, who finished with a
game-high 22 points, made a steal and took it in for a layup as her
team went on an 18-4 run.
</P>
<P>
   ``All season I would just take on the defense and go by them,'
said Ferdinand, who had three steals.
</P>
<P>
   DeTrina White finished with 19 points and 11 rebounds for LSU,
while forward April Brown had 16 points and six assists and Katrina
Hibbert had 14 points. Rice paced Duke with 14 points, including
two 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt we had to keep it close,'' said LSU coach Sue
Gunter. ``I never felt that panic.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut is 30-1 this season when leading at the half, and
its 57.1 percent shooting Saturday marked the 10th straight game
the Huskies have shot 50 percent or better from the field . . . Of
the 12 Huskies who played, only Marci Czel didn't score. Center
Christine Rigby, who entered the game with a minute to go,
converted a 3-point play off a layup with 36 seconds to go . . .
Senior Stacy Hansmeyer, who played for Coale in high school at
Norman, Okla., scored 3 points and pulled down three rebounds in
eight minutes . . . Coale said she now has a clear understanding of
the Husky machine. ``This was like a regular-season game for
them,'' she said. ``The bottom line is we have never been here
before, and they live here.'' . . . LSU's Gunter spent Saturday
afternoon watching the Huskies annihilate Oklahoma. She said she
took solace in her team's win over Duke because ``people thought
Duke and UConn were the only teams playing here this weekend. I
think now maybe people will appreciate Louisiana State and spell
our name right.'' . . . It was only the third time this season the
Blue Devils have squandered a halftime lead. They were 28-3 when
leading at the intermission.

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Purdue knew it was coming.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The questions were, When would it come, how long would it last
and how painful would it be?
</P>
<P>
   It's called a Wisconsin-induced drought.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue fought through one in the first half but couldn't survive
one in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin held Purdue without a field goal for a crucial
six-minute stretch late in the game and toppled the Boilermakers
64-60 in the West Regional final Saturday before a sellout crowd of
16,004 at The Pit.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers improved to 22-13 and became the first No. 8 seed to
advance to the Final Four since Villanova did it in 1985.
Wisconsin, which was unsure it would get an invitation to the NCAA
Tournament a week before it began, is the lowest seed to make the
Final Four since 11th-seeded LSU in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it'll be a repeat of the '85 Tournament and we can do
what Villanova did,'' Wisconsin forward Mark Vershaw said,
referring to the Wildcats' stunning upset of Georgetown for the
NCAA title.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin must feel like it's capable of accomplishing anything,
thanks to its current run of 12 wins in 14 games, with both losses
coming to Michigan State, its opponent in the national semifinals
in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue, which lost to its Big Ten rival for the third time in
four tries this season, took a 50-49 lead on a Brian Cardinal
jumper with 6:56 remaining. It was the second time the Boilermakers
went up by one in the second half, and it would be the last time.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue would not score another field goal until Greg McQuay put
back an offensive rebound with less than a minute to play. By then
Wisconsin had regained control, matching its biggest lead at 60-53.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last (seven) minutes they stepped it up a notch on
defense and we couldn't execute on offense,'' Purdue guard Jaraan
Cornell said. ``Somehow we couldn't get over the hump.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Bryant, who led all scorers with 18 points, drained a
3-pointer from the right corner, his fifth of the game, to put
Wisconsin on top for good 52-50 at the 5:48 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal, who had all 13 of his points in the second half, tied
the game for the Boilermakers with a pair of free throws, but Andy
Kowske answered with a layup off a feed from Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell missed two free throws, but Wisconsin failed to take
advantage as Roy Boone missed a shot, then picked up a steal and
blew an uncontested breakaway layup.
</P>
<P>
   Boone also had thrown up an airball and missed back-to-back free
throws after the Boilermakers grabbed the lead. But his fortunes
were about to change.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-3 junior reserve hit a huge running jumper in the lane and
went 4-for-4 from the foul line in the last 1:08 to help seal the
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't let the misses bother me, because I knew I was
going to have another chance to help the team win,'' Boone said.
``I was getting a little shaky, but it's a matter of how bad you
want it.''
</P>
<P>
   After Boone hit two free throws to give Wisconsin a 60-53 lead,
the biggest of the game, with just over a minute to play, Purdue
finally got a field goal and made one final push.
</P>
<P>
   McQuay's score got it going, and he added another tip-in
following missed free throws by Mike Kelley and Vershaw, to pull
the Boilermakers within 61-57.
</P>
<P>
   Boone was perfect at the line to up the lead to 63-57 before
Carson Cunningham, who had missed five consecutive 3-pointers,
finally put one home _ a leaning trey from the right side _ to cut
the lead to 63-60.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley hit one free throw with only 10.6 seconds on the clock
for a four-point lead, leaving Purdue with the slim hopes of a pair
of wild 3-point attempts before the Badgers' celebration could
begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a game (that was) about how I thought it would be,''
Purdue coach Gene Keady said. ``Unfortunately, they got the lead
and we didn't, so they dictated the tempo most of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were a little impatient. When they got the lead, we
got a little too impatient and shot the ball too quick, and that's
the worst thing you can do against them. We had it (written) on the
board twice: `got to be patient, don't panic and take quick
shots.'''
</P>
<P>
   Purdue's offensive struggles in the second half (11-for-32 from
the field) can be traced to its poor outside shooting. The
Boilermakers went 4-for-17 from beyond the arc in the half, after
going 3-of-6 in the first 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I feel so bad about is that I didn't step up and hit
the shots down the stretch,'' said Cunningham, who matched Cardinal
with a team-high 13 points but was only 4-of-12 from the field. ``I
thought I had good looks, but I have to give Wisconsin credit. They
played good defense on me.''

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ For the second straight game, there was a
Palace revolt in progress, and it appeared the royal family was in
danger of losing a few heads.
</P>
<P>
   Mateen Cleaves was again struggling to find the range on his
shots, while the fouls were piling up on Andre Hutson, A.J. Granger
and Charlie Bell.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight time in this upset-filled NCAA
Tournament, the Michigan State Spartans _ the only No. 1 seed left
_ were getting a bottoms-up view of the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Fizer, a daunting bull to ride in any rodeo, had just
ripped another rebound and signaled for a timeout while soaring
high above the out-of-bounds line. That set off an eruption from
Spartans coach Tom Izzo that drew a technical foul and gave Iowa
State a real reason to believe.
</P>
<P>
   For the second evening of what was supposed to be a home-court
coronation of sorts, the green-and-white celebration in the stands
had turned as nervous and fidgety as a wedding where the organ
music is playing and the bride is nowhere in sight.
</P>
<P>
   When Kantrail Horton made the pair of free throws off Izzo's
technical, resulting in a seven-point margin, Iowa State was most
definitely the Cyclones, and Michigan State was the trailer park.
</P>
<P>
   But if you listened hard through the funereal silence, maybe it
was possible to hear the Supremes singing You Keep Me Hangin' On.
Surely, if you cocked an ear, you could make out the Four Tops
crooning It's The Same Old Song. And wasn't that Martha Reeves and
the Vandellas echoing out of the rafters about a Heat Wave?
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Just up the road from Detroit, Morris Peterson was
turning up the volume on his collection of golden oldies. Welcome
back to Mo Town.
</P>
<P>
   Just as he did Thursday night against Syracuse, Mo Pete made his
presence felt like a guy with a handful of quarters standing at the
jukebox.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Orangemen in the regional semifinal, he ignited
Michigan State's comeback by slinging in three consecutive
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Against Iowa State in Saturday's Midwest final, Mo Pete went
inside for layups, over the top for his sweet jumpers and way, way
upstairs for a mind-bending, Cyclone-shattering slam dunk off an
alley-oop pass from Cleaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't nervous when we were down,'' said Cleaves, who runs
the show on the floor and runs the rants in the Spartans' locker
room. ``I know that Morris is always there to make the big plays.
You always know what you'll get from him.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, mo', mo' and mo' from Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Pete scored 13 of his team-leading 18 points in the last 7{
minutes of the game and poured in a half dozen in the last 2:54,
when the Spartans got up off the floor and seized control.
</P>
<P>
   This is the attribute that makes Michigan State so special, the
team that was the preseason national championship pick of so many
and has been able to survive five months of playing with a
bull's-eye on its back. While so many of the giants have fallen in
this Tournament, the Spartans keep moving forward because they know
how to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The story so often told about them is of Cleaves' passing up a
chance to jump to the NBA last year _ after MSU lost in the
semifinal game at the Final Four _ and returning to lead his team.
</P>
<P>
   The story too often overlooked is that Mo Pete is also a senior
eyed just as hungrily by the pro scouts. Wouldn't he look nice in
those Rockets pajamas?
</P>
<P>
   Which one will have the better NBA career? You might be
surprised. Mo Pete is 6-6 and can do so many things. He cuts, and
he moves. He shoots those lefty jumpers faster than a hummingbird's
heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   And ooooh, yeah, he can fly.
</P>
<P>
   The brawling game had become a jumble of confusion thanks to
three referees named Moe, Larry and Curly. There was Izzo's
technical and the ejection of ISU coach Larry Eustachy with 9.9
seconds left in the game. There was a horribly gutless double-foul
call with 3:43 left and the Cyclones ahead 61-60.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Bell gave the Spartans a slim lead with a 15-foot
jumper. Then, after a timeout, Peterson took off and took over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll blow my cover,'' said Izzo. ``It was Morris' call in the
huddle. He asked what did I think about the lob. I said I thought
it was a great idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves, the quarterback, threw the high TD pass. Mo Pete, the
eagle, soared and slammed it home for a 64-61 lead that was as big
as a mile. Now Iowa State could hear the Temptations singing I
Can't Get Next To You.
</P>
<P>
   Mo-mentum. The Spartans closed with a 20-3 rush.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves made the all-tournament team. But Peterson was named the
Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a team with a purpose and still games to play,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two Mo, in all likelihood.

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
AUSTIN _ The lure of the NBA was supposed to temper the allure of
the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   So many kids began bolting out of school early, beginning in
earnest shortly after the unforgettable Magic Johnson-Larry Bird
showdown for the national championship in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Two words in the college game's vernacular were supposed to
become virtually extinct as the trend for early entry into the NBA
draft grew: Senior year.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomores began bolting. Freshmen. Then, high schoolers began
skipping their chance at university life altogether, chasing the
lure of NBA dollars and causing the college game's purists to wring
their hands and worry that maybe the greatest single-sport
spectacle in America would lose some of its attraction.
</P>
<P>
   But look now at the captivating 2000 Tournament, which has won
ratings wars with NBA games across the board this month. And look
here, at the South Regional in Austin, where no team has epitomized
the seemingly endless magic of the Tournament more than Tulsa,
which faces North Carolina at 1:40 p.m. for the right to advance to
the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always believed that we could get the job done,'' Tulsa
senior guard Tony Heard said. ``We trust each other. We play team
ball. We won a lot of games early, and the more we've won, the more
we've believed.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a team that has proved itself a national championship
contender for one reason alone. It has no superstars.
</P>
<P>
   Witness Duke's marvelous team of 1999. It was an overwhelming
team that fell just short of winning it all. Had even just two of
the four players that bolted to the NBA after last season's run
stayed in Durham, N.C., this 2000 season might still be going for
the Dookies.
</P>
<P>
   But instead, coach Mike Krzyzweski was forced to rely on youth
and more high school all-Americans. The Blue Devils again marched
to the nation's No. 1 ranking, but Friday night in a Sweet 16 loss
to the Florida Gators, the lack of Tournament-proven experience
contributed mightily to the Blue Devils' not having what it took to
finish off a feisty Gators team.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa, on the other hand, features three seniors, a junior and a
third-year sophomore in its starting five. When the Golden
Hurricane fell behind Miami with less than seven minutes remaining
Friday night, it calmly and deliberately made every play, made
every perfect rotation defensively, sank critical free throws down
the stretch and walked away with an 80-71 win.
</P>
<P>
   Only one Tulsa starter stands taller than 6-5. Not one was a
high school All-American. The only Hurricane player widely
recruited was 6-10 center Brandon Kurtz, and the only reason he
wound up at Tulsa out of Bakersfield (Calif.) College was because
his coach was a friend of Tulsa head coach Bill Self.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, we were loaded with big guys, and I told
(Bakersfield coach Mark Arce) that we didn't need a big guy,'' Self
said. ``He told me, `You'll need this one.' (Kurtz) is a low-post
presence, and there just aren't that many in the college game right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   There's lots of them in the NBA, of course. But what will you
watch on TV today?
</P>
<P>
   While the overall talent level in the college game might not be
as high as it once was, parity has made the NCAA Tournament's
allure better, not worse.
</P>
<P>
   Two words: Single elimination.
</P>
<P>
   It is why teams such as Tulsa and Gonzaga can pull out huge wins
on any given Tournament day and captivate the nation. No superstars
equals balance. Given the right coach, which Self certainly is,
anything can happen.
</P>
<P>
   In the Tournament's second-round match, Cincinnati was without
stud big man Kenyon Martin, who broke his leg in the Conference USA
tournament. The Bearcats struggled to find a fluid game against the
Hurricane and were scrambling to find a leader in the final
minutes. Meanwhile, Tulsa calmly breezed from behind to take out
Cincy with yet another cool late-game run.
</P>
<P>
   Experience equals a legitimate chance to knock off squads that
feature high school all-Americans. Squads like Duke, Cincinnati, or
Tulsa's opponent today, North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like about our team is you have to defend all five, not
two or three,'' Self said. ``If one guy isn't on, maybe three
others are, and that's a big plus.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Kurtz was huge in the win over Miami, as much with
his clever passing and tough rebounding in the first half as with
his 17 second-half points. Leading scorer David Shelton struggled
for Tulsa, but Eric Coley and guard Greg Harrington filled the
void.
</P>
<P>
   The best player on Tulsa's team is likely the high-hopping 6-5
forward, Coley, but he, too, was not a big-time recruit. Oklahoma
State showed the most interest of the big basketball schools, but
Cowboys coach Eddie Sutton backed away in the final days of
recruiting, and Coley signed with the Hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team plays well together, and that's half the battle right
there,'' Coley said. ``We know our niche, and when we find it, we
run with it. What we've done (in the Tournament) is no different
than what we've done in the first 30-something games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricane can play great basketball even without a great
player. No Tulsa player in the regular rotation averages more than
14 points, but five average in double figures. One, maybe two,
should earn a chance in an NBA camp when their eligibility expires.
</P>
<P>
   Superstars? Not at Tulsa. But that's what makes them so good.
That's what can make any experienced, balanced, gritty team slay
the high school All-Americans. And that's why the NCAA Tournament's
feared demise was greatly exaggerated.

 By JERRY WIZIG  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ For the third straight time in the most
precarious of situations, Michigan State looked at a glaring sign
that read ``Exit'' from the NCAA Tournament.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And once again, the Spartans survived, thanks to Morris
Peterson's late awakening and Andre Hutson's heroic defense that
carried Michigan State to a stirring 75-64 triumph over Iowa State
on Saturday night in the Midwest Regional final at the Palace of
Auburn Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, for the second straight year, the Spartans join another
Big Ten school in the Final Four next week. This time, it will be
West Regional champ Wisconsin, making its first Final Four
appearance since winning the 1941 title. A year ago, it was Ohio
State.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the fifth time since 1980 that the Big Ten has
provided half of the Final Four, with Michigan in 1989 the only
national champion out of that group.
</P>
<P>
   After a rib-rattling battle that at times called to mind the
32-5 Cyclones' nationally renowned wrestling program, the Spartans
(30-7) will arrive at the Final Four as the lone No. 1 seed to
survive. They will be matched against a Wisconsin team they beat
twice in the Big Ten regular season and again in the conference
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, voted the regional's Most Valuable Player, provided 13
of his 18 points in the second half, including seven of MSU's 11
points in a critical stretch in the last 4:37. Hutson, a 6-7
junior, got help from 6-9 A.J. Granger and others in jousting with
Marcus Fizer, ISU's 6-8, 265-pound center.
</P>
<P>
   Hutson also paired 17 points with 11 rebounds, and Granger added
18 points. Mateen Cleaves had 10 points with only two assists and
five turnovers, but he played stern defense on Cyclones point guard
Jamaal Tinsley.
</P>
<P>
   After a near-brawl of a game that brought one technical to
Michigan State coach Tom Izzo and two technicals and an ejection in
the final seconds to Iowa State's Larry Eustachy, Izzo perceived
the evening in the only way that was logical.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' he said, ``was the most incredible game I've been a
part of in my five years at Michigan State.''
</P>
<P>
   And no wonder. After trailing Utah by six in the second half in
the Midwest's second round, then Syracuse by 14 in the second half
of the Midwest semifinals Thursday night, the Spartans were behind
59-52 with 5:49 left when ISU's Kantrail Horton hit two free throws
following Izzo's technical.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had lost the game, there would have been a trail through
the whole state,'' said Izzo, referring to the unhappy MSU fans who
might have been after him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some coaches know when to pick their spots to get a T, and
since we won the game, I have to say that coach picked the right
time,'' said Cleaves as Izzo smiled at him.
</P>
<P>
   Granger then hit a 3-pointer for the Spartans that again aroused
their huge gathering among the crowd of 21,214. Fizer, the
Cyclones' main man, then muscled up an inside jumper between two
defenders, but it would be his final points of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, 3-of-11 shooting at the time, lobbed in a trey from
the corner, and Charlie Bell sank two free throws when Fizer was
called for his fourth foul on an illegal screen, one of several
calls that enraged Eustachy.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cyclones ahead 61-60, ISU's Paul Shirley drove inside
and collided with Bell, with Bell apparently called for a foul
before the officials decided a double foul was proper. The
possession arrow favored ISU, and at that point his assistants had
to restrain Izzo. But Horton missed, and Hutson rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's jumper connected from the right wing, and the Spartans
regained the lead 62-61 with 2:54 remaining, a margin that grew to
67-61 with 53 seconds to play, increasing MSU's run to 15-2. In
their previous game, the Spartans had held Syracuse scoreless for
the final 5:54 during a closing 17-0 burst, so it was as close to a
reprise as possible.
</P>
<P>
   After Fizer missed from underneath, Izzo called a timeout, and
the Spartans then set up Cleaves' lob to Peterson over the 6-3
Tinsley for a slam that kept the MSU spree alive. Peterson then
added two free throws and Cleaves one of two, but Michael Nurse's
3-pointer with 44 seconds left reduced the MSU lead to 67-64.
Peterson's two free throws made the margin safer, and then Eustachy
briefly lost control with 9.9 seconds to go when Nurse was called
for a foul on Hutson. The ensuing two technicals on Eustachy and
Nurse's personal resulted in six closing free throws.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, the Cyclones failed to take advantage of a
monstrous 12-1 early rebound edge, offset by 10 Iowa State
turnovers in the first 10 minutes. The Spartans went 9{ minutes
before taking down their second rebound of the night, yet they led
14-12 at that juncture on a Bell jump shot.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves' 15-footer from out front gave the Spartans a 23-19
lead, but the Cyclones rallied with a 10-4 run with Fizer on the
bench for the final 4:30 before halftime with his second personal.
In Fizer's absence from the paint area, Hutson laid in a basket off
a Granger assist, then Granger took Cleaves' only assist of the
first half for another MSU layup and a 31-29 lead. After Shirley's
two free throws tied it at 31 for ISU, Cleaves hit again for the
Spartans' 34-31 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, the Cyclones held a 38-27 rebounding edge over the
nation's No. 1 rebounding team but shot only 35.5 percent in the
second half as they ended the best season in school history.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team was especially accurate, with ISU 9-of-26 on 3s,
five of them by Nurse, and Michigan State 5-of-19. But in the match
of pit bulls that filled the night, it was to be expected.

 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ Hal Sutton wants it known that he will
not ``roll over and play dead.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Never mind that it looked Saturday as if he already had suffered
a lethal injection into the lake surrounding the 17th green at the
Tournament Players Course at Sawgrass. Sutton is downright defiant
about going head-up against Tiger Woods today in the final round of
The Players Championship.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, this one comes straight out of the
be-careful-what-you-wish-for file. As early as Wednesday before the
tournament began, Sutton made a point of saying that Woods doesn't
intimidate him. Now, Sutton has a chance to put the money _ $1.08
million for the winner _ where his mouth is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to start anything, but he's one shot down going
into tomorrow,'' Sutton said after limping to the end Saturday with
a triple-bogey 6 on golf's most famous par-3. ``Obviously, it's
deflating. I'd like to have the four-shot lead back. But I can't
take it back. So I'll just take what I have and go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton's situation going into the final round today is sort of
like sitting down to enjoy a gourmet dinner and then realizing
you'll have to pick bones out of every bite of the fish. It could
have been as easy as picking through a fillet if not for the 17th.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've both got some work to do,'' Sutton said. ``Probably,
we'll have to get down in the dirt and fight a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton threw away the chance to start the battle with a serious
advantage. Before the 17th, he still was four strokes ahead of
Woods. As it turned out, Sutton had to settle for his third
consecutive 69 and a 9-under-par 207 total. Woods, who never had
broken 70 at the TPC as a pro, shattered that stat with a 6-under
66 and will start today at 8-under 208. Tom Lehman is a distant
third at 5-under 211 after double-bogeying 18 for a third-round 72.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I play for _ to be paired on Sunday in The Players
Championship with the greatest player in the world,'' Sutton said.
``That's what you dream about as a little boy _ a long time ago for
me. I'm glad I'm in the last group playing with Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very confident. I mean, to stand up there on 18 after
making triple bogey and letting Tiger back into the tournament like
that, I played good (on the finishing hole). So I felt like I had
control of my golf swing.''
</P>
<P>
   He had control of the tournament for the longest time Saturday
as it became increasingly clear through the day that Woods was
going to be the only pursuer with a realistic chance of running
down Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Woods birdied four of his first six holes, he couldn't
bite into Sutton's lead, which was only a shot over Lehman and Omar
Uresti starting the day but _ with those players backpedaling _
quickly grew.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton was sizzling yet kept dodging the heat-seeking missile
that is Woods, who had tracked Sutton the way the Pentagon keeps
tabs on satellites. But every time he lined up Sutton for a direct
hit of birdies or an eagle, Sutton hit his own thrusters and bolted
further out of Woods' view.
</P>
<P>
   There was a three-hole birdie binge starting on No. 5, with the
longest putt coming from 15 feet. When Woods bogeyed the 10th after
he knocked his approach over the green, he was losing touch with
Sutton. The lead, first three, then four shots, had become a
massive six-stroke advantage as Sutton was 11 under par. He was
heading into another galaxy, far, far away from a mere all-world
player like Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying,'' Sutton said, ``to answer everything he did.''
</P>
<P>
   And then Sutton burned up on re-entry at the notorious 17th hole
at the TPC at Sawgrass. Rarely has a splashdown been more
injurious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to recall that shot on 17, but I'm not sure I'd play
it any differently,'' he said. ``I put a good swing on it. We had
145 yards, and I hit a three-quarter 9-iron. I don't normally hit
it that far.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, the ball one-hopped over the island green and into
the water. Sutton dropped but watched Uresti hit a ball into the
water again from the drop area. Overly cautious, Sutton left his
70-yard pitch about 50 feet short, and his first putt came up 15
feet shy. He narrowly missed the double-bogey putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hollering `uncle' the whole time and couldn't get away
from that hole,'' Sutton said. ``It was a triple bogey. But it
wasn't the end of the world, because I had it to give back. That's
why I said I had to accept it and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   For Woods, this was like giving him a hand up off the mat. A
four-shot deficit against one of the world's top players would have
been a tall order today. Now, he is one down and basically
toe-to-toe with Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate goal is to win,'' Woods said. ``In order to (do
that) you've got to beat the rest of the field. I'm going to go out
there and play my own game and see what happens. Obviously, Hal
might think a little different (with only a one-shot lead).''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton even seemed to get a little defensive about his
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is you've got the greatest championship in the game
and you've got the best player in the world, according to the world
rankings, right there on my tail,'' Sutton said. ``Now that doesn't
mean he is going to win, even though everybody else in the world is
trying to figure out a way for him to go ahead and do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to make any other points. The only point I really
want to make is driving it in the fairway on the first tee. I will
start trying to make my points after that.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Saturday's developments proved to Sutton that
he should be prepared for anything and everything today.
</P>
<P>
   That is part of what makes the Tournament Players Course at
Sawgrass so intriguing, he said. Sutton said you have to expect the
unexpected. Then, he amended his thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be willing to accept the unexpected,'' he said.

Eds. note: this is a copyrighted story 
By BETH BARRETT AND GREG GITTRICH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES, Calif. -- Confronted with confidential internal
memos, the District Attorney's Office admits that a highly regarded
prosecutor urged his bosses to file conspiracy charges against
several Rampart Division cops -- days before he was pulled off the
LAPD corruption task force.
</P>
<P>
   The office's backpedaling Saturday came one day after District
Attorney Gil Garcetti, responding to a Los Angeles Daily News
report on the thwarted prosecution effort, denied on a local radio
talk show that Deputy District Attorney George Rosenstock had
aggressively sought approval to indict cops involved in a brutal
station-house beating.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti, who has refused repeated requests for interviews,
insisted on KCRW's ``Which Way L.A.'' that the controversy was
manufactured by the Los Angeles Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   When faced Saturday with a series of confidential memos obtained
by the Daily News, Garcetti's spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons
acknowledged that Rosenstock wanted to file the first criminal
charges against cops other than Rafael Perez, the central figure in
the worst police corruption case in city history.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons said other top D.A. officials were aware of the memos,
but insisted Garcetti was never informed by the senior prosecutors
he hand- picked to lead the task force.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no reason for them to notify him (Garcetti). It was
just a memo, basically a prosecutor's assessment of what needed to
be done,'' Gibbons said. ``He (Garcetti) probably would have been
notified when they were ready to file.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti was wrong when he said Rosenstock was pulled off the
Rampart prosecution team at his own request. According to Gibbons,
Garcetti meant to say Rosenstock asked to be assigned to Long
Beach, almost 24 miles southwest of Los Angeles, after he was
removed.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenstock, who now handles routine, low-profile cases, first
explained his prosecutorial plan in memos last December, including
one sent to Head Deputy District Attorney Clifford Klein, who was
then in charge of the corruption probe. Rosenstock specifically
noted that he believed enough evidence existed to prosecute
disgraced officer Brian Hewitt for a vicious 1998 station-house
beating. Rosenstock added that he needed more information from the
LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing two months, the deputy district attorney
repeatedly updated Klein, members of the LAPD, de facto lead
prosecutor Richard Rosenthal, and eventually Dan Murphy, the man
chosen by Garcetti in January to lead the police corruption task
force.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenstock's efforts culminated in a Feb. 4 memo to Murphy and
five other prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the six pages of correspondence, Rosenstock explained
in detail that he had a solid conspiracy case against Hewitt and at
least three other officers involved in the Feb. 26, 1998,
station-house beating of Ismael Jimenez.
</P>
<P>
   While Rosenstock could not be reached for comment, there is no
mistaking his intent. He led off the memo with this
straight-forward declaration:
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the prosecution theories outlined herein are viewed by
the writer as viable and are recommended for filing.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to underscore the importance of filing a conspiracy
case against the elite anti-gang officers in Rampart's now
disbanded Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rampart CRASH conspiracy includes a heightened danger to
the public welfare even beyond that which may be expected from
conspiracies among law enforcement officers because the conspiracy
was so extensive as to include intimidating witnesses to official
wrongdoing from registering complaints with appropriate authorities
further insulating the conspiracy from discovery,'' Rosenstock
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after he sent the memo, Rosenstock was yanked from
the task force by Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the incident said the decision to exile
Rosenstock, who was highly regarded by LAPD investigators, was a
significant flashpoint in the acrimonious relationship between
Garcetti and Police Chief Bernard C. Parks.
</P>
<P>
   After learning about Rosenstock's fate, sources said, LAPD
detectives felt all of their work gathering evidence to prosecute
Hewitt was being mishandled and swept under the rug.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, Parks increased his calls for Garcetti to
immediately indict dirty cops. The chief repeatedly mentioned
Hewitt and two other cops by name. In response, Garcetti said he
was being thorough to ensure the investigation was complete and
charged that police investigators were refusing to cooperate with
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In sworn statements last September,
corrupt-cop-turned-key-informant Perez said he and other cops shot
at least one unarmed man, routinely framed suspected gang members
for crimes, and lied in court to send innocent people to jail. To
date, 46 convictions have been overturned, and at least 20 officers
have been removed from duty, if not fired.
</P>
<P>
   No cops have been indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti has consistently argued that his office shares none of
the blame for the scandal even though his prosecutors put scores of
innocent people behind bars without a clue of wrongdoing. He has
come to refer to the corruption as the LAPD's ``mess'' and has
rejected any calls for an outside review of his office's handling
of perhaps hundreds of cases involving falsified evidence and
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In Rosenstock's final memo before being removed, he concluded:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rampart/CRASH conspiracy appears to be an especially
insidious form of (an) illegal agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons said Saturday that senior prosecutors had received at
least two pieces of the Rosenstock correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   The first memo was written in early December to Klein. The
second was a ``personal and confidential'' memo to Assistant
District Attorney Michael Tranbarger, written after after
Rosenstock was reassigned. Gibbons said she was unable to reach
other senior prosecutors to track down additional confidential
memos obtained by the Los Angeles Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   The two memos Gibbons referenced went all the way up the chain
of command but never were submitted to Garcetti himself, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Together, all of the Rosenstock memos paint a picture of a
conscientious prosecutor seeking a broad body of evidence from the
police as he was building a legal foundation to indict cops on
conspiracy charges. All along, he kept his bosses informed.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, he described a tense relationship with the
police and expressed difficulty getting some information from the
Internal Affairs unit. But sources said Rosenstock was well
respected by police for his ability and thoroughness.
</P>
<P>
   Citing his experience as a federal prosecutor in New York,
Rosenstock was convinced by early February that he had enough
evidence to corroborate Perez's sworn statements about officers
being in a conspiratorial ``loop'' to commit crimes or cover up
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The ``loop'' is ``in essence, the description of an express
and/or tacit agreement to commit the unlawful acts of obstruction
of justice, perjury, witness intimidation, and filing of false
reports,'' Rosenstock wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hewitt case, Rosenstock noted that cops badgered a
witness to withhold information.
</P>
<P>
   They warned: ``Don't say (expletive) to them (Internal
Affairs).'' Hewitt, who was fired for the beating, has denied any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In sworn statements to investigators, Perez has said Hewitt
enjoyed beating up people and was in ``the loop.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Rosenstock's work, sources said, Murphy was reluctant to
file the indictments because he wanted more corroboration of
Perez's statements from other cops.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy also rebuffed Rosenstock's efforts to bring in federal
agents to help LAPD investigators, sources said. Eventually, six
federal agents joined the task force at Parks' request on Feb. 23
-- nearly three weeks after Rosenstock's reassignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Rosenstock) had a new office, a new fax, a new team,'' said
attorney Dennis Chang, who represents the man beaten by Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there was nothing,'' Chang said. ``It went completely
dead.''
</P>

STARS STILL HAVE MAJOR QUESTIONS TO ANSWER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since we've all now witnessed it, there is no debate _ the road
to the Stanley Cup is the ultimate in grueling journeys. For sheer
physical and mental torture, the NHL proudly gives us the mother of
all playoff systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom'' was good to the Stars a year ago. ``Mom'' is about to
come calling again.
</P>
<P>
   It's two weeks and counting. The regular season is in deep
stretch. The Stars' world championship defense begins the second
week in April.
</P>
<P>
   Is this team Cup-ready? Compared to a year ago, it's not even
close. Too many injuries have caused too much turmoil, and this has
been going on since the first puck dropped in October. Plus, clubs
with only one scoring line tend to take an early playoff hike. At
the moment, if it's not Modano and Co., the goals don't come
consistently enough.
</P>
<P>
   But at this late stage, opinions from within the locker room are
more important than shooting from the hip in a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, here's a sampling:
</P>
<P>
   Best team the Stars have faced this season?
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Louis,'' coach Ken Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Louis, positionally and defensively, is right there,''
center Joe Nieuwendyk said. ``Detroit is a different club, but very
explosive on offense. And from what I'm seeing of Colorado lately,
that team is suddenly looking great.''
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Louis reminds me of us a year ago, and that's very
dangerous,'' winger Jamie Langenbrunner said. ``Colorado changed
some faces, and you have to watch out for them. Detroit is still
very tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the locker room, there was eager anticipation about
Colorado's visit to Reunion Arena this afternoon. ``That's been a
different team since we last saw them,'' Nieuwendyk said.
</P>
<P>
   But for wire-to-wire consistency in this regular season, there
has been nothing in the NHL to compare to St. Louis. The kicker
here, of course, is that the Blues have the best record in the
league behind the goaltending of a certain ex-Star.
</P>
<P>
   In the form of Roman Turek, the Stars traded the Presidents'
Trophy to St. Louis. Did they also trade the Stanley Cup?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I told you I'd never had a second thought about that deal,
then I'd have to spend several hours in the confessional,'' Stars
general manager Bob Gainey said. ``I guess we'll cross that bridge
when we come to it, if we come to it. There are plenty of
challenges, however, between now and then.''
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner, pausing and smiling at the mention of last
summer's trade, added, ``that was unfortunate the way that whole
thing happened. Turek is doing great. But if we face him in the
playoffs, we'll have to hope we can score some goals on him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Time will tell on how that trade impacts us,'' Nieuwendyk
said, smiling. ``Let's hope it doesn't come back to haunt us.''
</P>
<P>
   On the question of concern about the Turek trade also resulting
in a Stanley Cup trade, Hitchcock had a quick reply. ``There's none
at all. We know how long and difficult the process is. At the end
of the day, it's going to be all about us, not about anyone on the
opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, however, the Turek situation adds to the
upcoming playoff intrigue for the Stars. As if defending a world
championship wasn't enough ...
</P>
<P>
   What if there is a future meeting with the Blues? What if Turek
wins the duel with Eddie Belfour? Would the second-guessing ever
end?
</P>
<P>
   How do you compare the Stars right now with where the team was a
year ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's hard to judge,''Nieuwendyk said. ``Due to injuries,
we've still got players coming and going. I don't know yet if this
team is ready for the playoffs. A year ago, without question, we
were. And we were also the favorite to win it all. This time that
won't be the case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting close to ready, but unlike this time a year ago,
we aren't there yet,'' Langenbrunner said. ``Maybe all the
adversity, and what we've had to overcome, helps us in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see right now is a lot of energy and a lot of
enthusiasm,'' Hitchcock said. ``Last year, we were a methodical,
workmanlike club. By comparison, this team is almost giddy in
nature. The pressure isn't there like a year ago. We know what to
expect, know what it takes, but overall, we have the same
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   The time is near. ``Mother'' is calling. Only the baddest of the
bad should bother to answer. nn

NASCAR'S PROBLEMS NOT SO BAD, BUT KEEP IT TO YOURSELF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the annual pilgrimage of NASCAR nation prepares to descend
upon us, we learn that not all is well.
</P>
<P>
   The races have been ``less interesting,'' or so some say. The
media won't cooperate. The drivers won't drive fender-to-fender.
And when driver Dale Jarrett tried to say something about it all,
he was taken to task so swiftly that he apologized the very next
week and said, ``I promise to race hard and keep my opinions to
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than that _ and, oh, yes, the empty seats _ it's been a
grand Winston Cup season.
</P>
<P>
   Is NASCAR's 15 minutes of fame over?
</P>
<P>
   Some may think so. Some may even write it. But NASCAR recently
celebrated its 50th year of racing, which suggests a lot more
staying power than just exhaust fumes.
</P>
<P>
   The question was posed to Eddie Gossage, who has a uniquely
vested interest in NASCAR's ongoing vitality. As general manager of
Texas Motor Speedway, Gossage next Sunday has to fill 170,000
seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal take is that the season has not been as bad as
some have said, but on the other hand it's not as good as it's been
in the past, either,'' Gossage said.
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. Gossage likened the Winston Cup series to an NFL
season, with its cycles of nail-biters and blowouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Cracker Barrel 500 in Atlanta earlier this month ended in a
mesmerizing photo finish. On the other hand, the Daytona 500, the
sport's showpiece, was barely more exciting than the postrace
traffic jam.
</P>
<P>
   Even people inside the sport, however, are admitting that the
racing has been different this season. They blame prominently the
circuit's switch to steel-belted radial tires. The old ones, the
bias-ply models, may have been prone to cuts and punctures, but the
drivers say that at least they knew what they were getting in the
corners.
</P>
<P>
   The tires were changed for safety reasons. But therein lies the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR, some would suggest, has become too safe for its own
good. Even when Jarrett talked himself into the verbal wall a few
weeks ago, he was patched up and fitted with press conference
``restrictor plates,'' and NASCAR sent him on his way.
</P>
<P>
   The sport needs characters. Its grassroots fans grew up watching
Cale Yarborough battle the Allisons. It needs tracks with
personality, like Bristol, where the drivers are racing this
weekend. And rather than single-file, follow-the-leader racing, it
needs more paint-swapping, side-by-side contests, even if it means
slowing the cars down another 15-20 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   But there we media people go, trying to influence the paying
public again. And the folks at NASCAR seem not to know exactly how
to handle that.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Winston Cup season began, writers noted that the new
credential application contained language by which the organization
claimed rights to every picture, quotation and printed word seen or
heard at a NASCAR event.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has been muzzled. Someone must have gotten hold of the
Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   But cloaked in Jarrett's original charges was the implication
that the media, as a way of sniping back at NASCAR's feeble try at
censorship, was going out of its way to criticize the racing.
</P>
<P>
   No, I would argue, we wouldn't do that. But the old guard is
changing. There is a different breed of reporter covering the
NASCAR circuit these days _ and more of them, as the number of
tracks expands.
</P>
<P>
   And discontent, whether it comes from a frustrated driver or
from a fan who bought a $50 ticket and sat in a four-hour traffic
jam, makes good copy.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR does have a problem with rising prices. (In fairness, it
should be noted that Bruton Smith, whose Speedway Motorsports Inc.,
owns TMS, lowered prices for some tickets at Charlotte).
</P>
<P>
   But this is an organization, remember, that just signed a
six-year, $2.6-billion TV deal. There were empty seats spotted at
Darlington, Rockingham and Atlanta, but the early-season Winston
Cup circuit is vulnerable to foul weather. Some of those empty
seats, too, were new seats, added mostly for that track's
more-popular second Winston Cup race.
</P>
<P>
   Gossage is confident that he will have a sellout _ all 170,000
worth. For the first time, the weekend's three main events will all
carry the names of big-time sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Has NASCAR peaked? There's a four-hour traffic jam next Sunday
that will prove absolutely not.
</P>
<P>
   But don't tell NASCAR I told you.

UNIONS MAY DISRUPT L.A. DURING CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
 
(Fixing subject-verb agreement in lede and adding L.A. County
Federation of Labor in 5th paragraph.) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Flexing their new power, Los Angeles labor unions
with more than 250,000 members have banded together to fight for
lucrative contracts in the public and private sectors, threatening
to embarrass or even disrupt the city during this summer's
Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   From blue-collar workers to actors and writers, from sheriff's
deputies to janitors and graduation students, the coalition of
local unions hopes to see them work together if they don't win
large pay raises or other concessions in contract talks that kick
off this month.
</P>
<P>
   Among the targets of joint protests _ and, as a last resort,
strikes _ are the Los Angeles Unified School District, county
government, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, city of Long
Beach, the Gas Co. and Kaiser Permanente.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles city workers are not members of the coalition but
police and firefighters are up for a new contract, and those talks
will add to the labor tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been a convergence of this kind with the
opening of collective bargaining,'' said Miguel Contreras,
executive secretary-treasurer of the L.A. County Federation of
Labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also don't think we've ever been at a point where so
many workers have contracts coming up in the same period. We just
realized what we will be facing last year and it sent up a red flag
for us to try to create a common message around the county.''
</P>
<P>
   As a way to kick off the campaign, some 2,000 members of the
different unions have scheduled a rally and march Tuesday in the
downtown area, beginning at LAUSD headquarters and picking up
marchers at the county Hall of Administration, Ronald Reagan State
Building and other locations, ending up at Pershing Square.
</P>
<P>
   Contreras said each union will be negotiating on its own, but
will look to the others for support in the event of any
demonstrations or work actions.
</P>
<P>
   And while he voiced hope the negotiations would be concluded
before the Democratic National Convention in mid-August, he
acknowledged it could be a factor in some talks and that local
officials do not want to see the city embarrassed during the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance, the county wants to hold off on some talks until
after the convention,'' Contreras said. ``We think we should be at
the table now.''
</P>
<P>
   Convention planners are monitoring the situation and voice hope
there will be no problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident that any labor issue will be resolved before
the convention begins,'' said Ben Austin, spokesman for the Los
Angeles Host Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But others privately admit to having some concerns if there is
not a resolution on most of the contracts by June.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get to June and there are still a number of outstanding
contracts, it would be a real concern,'' said one official, asking
not to be identified. ``If it gets to July, then it's a red-hot
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides of Mayor Richard Riordan said he is monitoring the
situation and believes the unions will have successfully completed
most of their contracts by the time of the convention. The
convention is scheduled Aug. 14-17 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The first test could some soon, with the janitors who are
members of SEIU Local 1877 preparing for a strike starting April1.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of janitors and their supporters demonstrated Friday
along Ventura Boulevard in Encino, temporarily stopping traffic,
while similar protests were held in Pasadena and Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are working to do is get the message out that it is
unions who represent workers and will get the best deal for them,''
Contreras said.
</P>
<P>
   The federation had its most successful year ever last year,
signing up 91,000 workers for unions, mostly home-care workers. It
has continued its aggressive recruitment drive this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Economic Development Corp.
of Los Angeles, said forming the coalition was a logical next step
for the unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is strong and they want to get their fair share,''
Kyser said. ``But there are some who worry that while the economy
is good now, it might cool off and they don't want to get into high
contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Contreras said workers particularly those in the government
sector are due for large raises since many took pay cuts or saw
their salaries frozen during the bad economic times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the workers who took the cuts and when the economy is
strong, we should benefit as well,'' Contreras said.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the contract talks involve more issues than
salary and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Sacharow, a spokesman for the federation, said teachers
will be dealing with issues such as the breakup of the school
district and pressure to accept merit pay rules. Workers in the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority are concerned about efforts
to create a San Fernando Valley Transit Zone that would take over
operation of dozens of MTA bus lines.
</P>
<P>
   One of the challenges facing the unions is getting members to
work together and support one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what we're doing is education and let someone who
works for the Gas Co. know that an unemployed actor or writer from
the Screen Actors Guild has the same problems he does,'' Contreras
said.

NO. 1 WISCONSIN TAKEN DOWN BY EAGLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Boston College, doing it the hard way once again,
is two victories away from its first ice hockey national
championship since 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday &UR;  &LR; night the Eagles took on the best in the West,
top-ranked Wisconsin, and whipped the Badgers, 4-1, at Mariucci
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   And now they'll be playing closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   The win set up a potential best-of-Boston battle in the Frozen
Four in Providence. BC will play the winner of Sunday's Boston
University-St. Lawrence East Regional game in one of the semifinals
April 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be interesting to see who we'll play,'' said standout
defenseman and captain Mike Mottau. ``It's exciting. We've been
there the last two years, and the experience could help get us over
the hump.''
</P>
<P>
   Said coach Jerry York: ``We want to win one of these Final
Fours. We're kind of geared up for Providence.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be the third straight Frozen Four appearance for the
Eagles. For the second year in a row, they played their way into
the championship round through the West Regional. Both years BC had
to win a pair of games, one of them against the top seed, to
advance.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Eagles (28-11-1) took out Northern Michigan and
North Dakota in Madison, Wis., before falling to eventual national
champion Maine, 2-1, in overtime in the semifinals. This year BC
victimized Michigan State _ with a last-minute goal to tie, then a
goal in overtime to win _ and Wisconsin (31-9-1), which had been
No. 1 in the country for much of the season.
</P>
<P>
   BC won this one on the strength of first-period goals by Blake
Bellefeuille and Brian Gionta for a 2-1 lead, an insurance goal by
Jeff Giuliano to open the third, and the 28-save goaltending of
junior Scott Clemmensen. Gionta added an empty-net goal with three
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Clemmensen, shaky at times in Friday night's 6-5 overtime win
over Michigan State, was sharp all night. He had a dozen saves in
the second period _ including one on which he slid back into the
crease after going out after the puck, and one on Matt Doman with
his leg _ to preserve BC's lead.
</P>
<P>
   And before that, in the last minute of the first period,
Clemmensen stopped Andy Wheeler in close after Mottau had committed
a rare mistake. ``I think the player was just as surprised to get
the puck as everyone else was that he had it,'' Clemmensen said.
``He shot it right away, and fortunately I got my pad on it.''
</P>
<P>
   He got his pads on most of them throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Michigan State game, ``I kind of got back on my heels
early,'' Clemmensen said. ``But I knew we still had a chance to
win, and that's my main goal _ to get the team in position to win,
no matter how badly I'm playing.''
</P>
<P>
   York said he gave no thought to replacing Clemmensen for
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night. Clemmensen had split time through much of the year
with Tim Kelleher, but York settled on Clemmensen and his stretch
run experience a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timmy's really good and if Scott pulls a groin or something,
he's ready to go,'' York said. ``But this is kind of Scott's team
to take us through.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemmensen, backed by Mottau and the defense, did just that
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, shutting down Wisconsin standout Steve Reinprecht
and his big line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they had that top scoring line,'' Mottau said. ``We
play five `D' and (Brooks Orpik's) hand was bothering him a little
in warmup and we didn't know if he'd be able to go. And he played
one of the best games of his career.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliano's goal gave the Eagles some breathing room as the third
period started. BC was just coming off a power play when Mike
Lephart burst around his man on the right wing. He shot and Graham
Melanson made the save, but the rebound bounced straight out to
Giuliano. With his back to the net and a defender all over him,
Giuliano got off a blind backhander that went under Melanson. It
was Giuliano's 10th goal of the year and first in his last eight
games.
</P>
<P>
   With a two-goal lead, the Eagles were flying. Toward Providence.

HOLLANDSWORTH WILL PROVE VALUABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ Devon White worked out at Dodgertown
rather than take the two-hour bus ride to play the Baltimore
Orioles on Saturday. Even so, F.P. Santangelo started in center
field while Todd Hollandsworth was in left.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's mentioned to Hollandsworth where the battle with White
for the starting center-field position stands, but nobody needs to.
The facts, to Hollandsworth, are enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can read into it,'' Hollandsworth said. ``It's odd. You
can see what's going to happen. You can see Devon is playing there
all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression is (manager) Davey (Johnson) is going to give
Devo a shot at it. That's Davey's decision, Davey's choice.''
</P>
<P>
   It leaves Hollandsworth with the role of backup outfielder. It's
a role he doesn't love, but his versatility makes it a natural. He
can play left, center or right field. And his left-handed bat is
just added incentive for the Los Angeles Dodgers to keep him,
though teams are constantly inquiring about him.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle general manager Pat Gillick has called numerous times
about Hollandsworth, but the Dodgers are unwilling to part with
him, particularly because of his versatility. Gary Sheffield missed
the last week with a hand injury, and Hollandsworth's been the
perfect replacement.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Dodgers had a big desire to trade Hollandsworth, it
probably would have happened prior to the 1999 season, when
Hollandsworth's agent, Jeff Moorad, said the one-time National
League Rookie of the Year wanted to be traded so he could start.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing the Dodgers' position, and a promise Hollandsworth would
be given a chance to beat out White, no such declaration was made
this past offseason. But the chance was given to Hollandsworth as a
way of motivating White, and it seemed to work.
</P>
<P>
   Though White is hitting just .216 this spring, he's played well
defensively. Hollandsworth, who has a team-high 57 at-bats and his
hitting .263, has been inconsistent at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   But Hollandsworth, 26, does have one thing in his favor. He's a
free agent after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do whatever Davey wants me to do,'' Hollandsworth said.
``I'm confident Davey will use me a lot like he did last year.
Whether it's left, center or right, it doesn't matter. Whatever
helps us win. We all know what year it is. They know what year it
is. I know what year it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Orel outstanding: Right-hander Orel Hershiser continued his
sizzling spring by pitching five no-hit innings against the
Orioles. He issued one walk and hit a batter in lowering his spring
ERA to 1.80. Hershiser said he hasn't felt ``this good in the
regular season'' since `93 or `94.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm crisper and firmer, so I'm throwing the ball better,'' he
said. ``Now, it's more glimpses of the old guy (Hershiser).''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser would like to carry the spring success into the
season. He's 3-5 with a 5.60 ERA in his past three Aprils.
</P>
<P>
   Castro or Berroa?: The play of switch-hitting outfielder Tony
Mota this spring may change Johnson's plans to carry six
outfielders and, thus, six infielders. Originally, Geronimo Berroa
was going to be the sixth outfielder because Johnson thought the
organization lacked outfield depth and needed to keep him.
</P>
<P>
   Mota, sent to the minors Friday, changed that thinking and has
opened the way for infielder Juan Castro. A magician with the
glove, Castro lacks the offensive punch to be the regular
shortstop. However, because of his defense, he could be an ideal
late-inning defensive replacement for Kevin Elster, who is
consistent at shortstop but lacks range.
</P>
<P>
   Castro plays second, third and shortstop, and is out of
minor-league options. The Dodgers have talked about trading him,
but haven't found the right deal and they don't want to give him
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to feel,'' said Castro, a career .188 hitter.
``Every chance (Johnson) gives me, I'm going to try to do my best.
I don't know what's going to happen. It's their decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Johnson said Sheffield, who's missed the last
eight games after injuring his left pinkie, would be in the lineup
today against the Marlins. Sheffield may need the at-bats. He said
he typically needs 35 to 40 at-bats in the spring to get his
timing, and he's had 23. He's batting .261.... Right-hander Eric
Gagne pitched six shutout innings in a Triple-A game against the
Mets, but it doesn't appear that will be enough to get him back in
contention with Carlos Perez for the final spot in the rotation.
Johnson said the reports on the outing were that Gagne was still
high in the zone. ``He showed signs of improvement. He looked more
comfortable,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said....
Johnson dipped into minor-league camp and brought former Mets first
baseman Chris Donnells and infielder Mike Metcalfe on the two-hour
trip to Baltimore so he can get a look at them for later in the
season if injuries deplete the big-league club.

LAKERS CAN'T MISS -- CAN THEY?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A mismatched pair of 7-footers jump for a tipped
pass near the Los Angeles Lakers basket. Their extra-long limbs
become tangled, they lose their balance and they hit the floor,
Shaquille O'Neal tumbling backward over Luc Longley of the Phoenix
Suns and landing with a thump at the edge of the purple-painted
key.
</P>
<P>
   Longley scrambles to his feet and follows the action upcourt.
O'Neal briefly remains supine, perhaps to make sure his tailbone
and wrists and testy hamstrings are in one piece, and while he does
that, 19,000 pairs of eyes in the Staples Center Friday night are
locked on him.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal might be immobile for only a second, but it's a second
that seems to stretch to June.
</P>
<P>
   In such moments you sense the fragility of the Lakers'
championship potential, dreading what an injury to O'Neal or Kobe
Bryant would do to the season.
</P>
<P>
   Then Shaq leaps to his feet and the feeling passes.
</P>
<P>
   These days, with the Lakers 58-12 and all but assured of
finishing the regular season with the NBA's best record, it's hard
to imagine anything except an injury to one of their two star
players keeping the team from winning the title in June. Coach Phil
Jackson can keep saying, ``The regular season and the playoffs are
like two different seasons,'' but the words ring hollow, a dramatic
warning against complacency.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are on a pace to win 68 games, joining only 10 teams
in NBA history in the 65-and-up category, the mark of the great
regular season. Of those 10 teams, nine went on to win the NBA
title.
</P>
<P>
   They included the 69-win Lakers of 1972 and the 65-win Lakers of
1987. And three Jackson-coached Chicago teams, the 67-win Bulls of
1992, the record-setting 72-win Bulls of 1996 and the 69-win Bulls
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was on the right side, also, in the only case of a
65-win team failing to win the title. That occurred in 1973, when
the Boston Celtics were beaten in the Eastern Conference final by
the New York Knicks, with whom the 27-year-old Jackson was a backup
front-court man. The Knicks had played part of the regular season
without injured Willis Reed, and the Celtics lost John Havlicek to
a bad shoulder for the series' seventh game, so this one could be
chalked up to medical circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The question for the Lakers, their coach and their fans is ...
What could go wrong now?
</P>
<P>
   I've come up with a short list.
</P>
<P>
   --O'Neal or Bryant could get hurt.
</P>
<P>
   --Another team could get hot and catch the Lakers in an
ill-timed cold spell.
</P>
<P>
   --John McCain could announce a third-conference candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Am I missing anything?
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers can't think of it, or if they can, they aren't
telling, since it's hard to talk and whistle in the dark at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell you the truth, I don't think anything can go wrong,''
Bryant said after the Lakers' sometimes-lazy, 109-101 victory over
the depleted Suns. ``My mind doesn't work like that, know what I
mean? As long as everybody stays healthy ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't want to focus on it,'' Rick Fox said of the
inevitability question. ``That's the kind of question that can only
give you a negative answer. Why would we want to focus on what can
go wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs, when they get under way in less than a month, will
be different. More energetic, more physical. Opponents will have
more than 48 minutes to try to figure out how to beat L.A.
</P>
<P>
   To reach the finals, the Lakers might have to go through
Sacramento (the only team to beat them in one 24-game stretch),
Portland (which beat them at home and at the Staples Center) and
San Antonio (which handed them a 24-point defeat).
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Derek Fisher said, ``We don't feel there's any team
out there that can beat us in a series.'' And they shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   After their 16-win streak in December and January, they lost six
of nine games and appeared shaken. But since having their 19-win
streak ended in March, they have won five games in a row. The
question about mental toughness seems to have been answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have said we've positioned ourselves as the best team
in the regular season. But,'' Fox said, ``they don't hand out a
trophy for that. Nothing's going to be given to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's fair to say that if the Lakers can play as well in
April, Mayand June as they have so far, a championship is
inevitable. As long as their MVP center and their all-around
slasher remain standing, and as long as complacency doesn't set in
(there's no reason to think it will).
</P>
<P>
   I asked Glen Rice about Jackson's warning about the difference
between the regular season and playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you expect to keep dominating teams the way you have?'' I
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   Knock on hardwood, it's a good question.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Although pure coincidence is suspected, the Los
Angeles Clippers do seem to win about as often as they get paid ...
twice a month.
</P>
<P>
   With that quota satisfied for March, they failed to make a case
for a third paycheck during Saturday night's 126-107 loss to the
Detroit Pistons before 17,840 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``They worked as hard as they could for 48 minutes,'' interim
coach Jim Todd said of a team that had just been waxed.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds fishy, but the Clippers did have a truly sweet alibi.
</P>
<P>
   For the third game in a row, a small-caliber ankle sprain KO'd
their most-willing shooter, Maurice Taylor. Gone was an opportunity
to audition for his hometown (Mo-town?) Pistons, who rate way up
there on Taylor's free-agent-to-be wish list.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Lamar ``Kingpin'' Odom, the Clippers' best player, was
reduced to civilian battle dress by a strained left calf. Odom
missed last Monday's loss to the Washington Wizards with a strained
right calf.
</P>
<P>
   Odom earned ``Kingpin'' status by rolling the ball the length of
the court to earn a spare technical following an unfavorable call
Thursday in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Tyrone Nesby (22 points), Michael Olowokandi (21), and
Eric Piatkowski (20) served as top guns. Olowokandi had a mere 3
personal fouls and just 3 rebounds, because Detroit (a toasty 63.3
percent from the field) rarely misfired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play no defense,'' said Nesby for all who were
wondering. ``They had us on our toes all night.''
</P>
<P>
   Seems as if they were stepping on your toes, Tyrone.
</P>
<P>
   With 31 points from Jerry Stackhouse, 19 from celebrated
sidekick Grant Hill, 20 from Lindsay Hunter and impressive
button-pushing by interim head coach George Irvine, Detroit (36-33)
was able to triumph for the eighth time in its last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to get a kick in the butt,'' said Stackhouse,
referring to Irvine's appointment as head coach and not Saturday's
foe.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers (14-57) chaperoned their losing streak to seven,
while maintaining the lead for the top seed in the NBA Draft
lottery. They jumped ahead of Chicago on Friday when the Bulls lost
their heads and defeated Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons, who lost Friday night at Sacramento, opened up in a
nasty defensive mood, shot 66.7 percent from the field and led,
35-25, after one quarter. They fired away at a 77.8 percent rate in
round two and held a relatively tolerable 68-52 lead at
intermission.
</P>
<P>
   After taking Detroit's best shot, the Clippers trimmed the
deficit to as little as 11 points midway through the third quarter
before fading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you're short-handed or not, you can't give up 126
points,'' Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Saturday's Clipper down-and-out list included Keith Closs,
who bowed out due to an asthma attack during pre-game warm-ups.
Closs was taken to the hospital, received medication and will be
evaluated Monday.

KENNEDY IMPRESSIVE IN DEBUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ Adam Kennedy began his Anaheim Angels career
with a bang Saturday afternoon, hitting a home run in his first
at-bat, and adding a two-run triple in the Angels' 10-0 victory
over the San Francisco Giants at Scottsdale Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Batting second in the lineup, Kennedy hit the second pitch he
saw over the right-field fence off Giants starter Russ Ortiz to
give the Angels a 2-0 lead. He finished the day 2 for 5 with four
RBI, one spectacular defensive play at second base, several good
plays and one throwing error to make an immediate impression on his
new team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great way for a guy to break in,'' Angels manager
Mike Scioscia said. ``He played the game hard. He was tested and
did a great job. It's exciting to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, acquired along with pitcher Kent Bottenfield Thursday
in a trade for Jim Edmonds, is excited about the opportunity to win
the starting second base job, but he said he wasn't nervous about
making a good first impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go through it all the time before a game,'' said Kennedy,
who grew up in Riverside and was a standout at Cal State
Northridge. ``You get the adrenaline going and the excitement of
playing. It wasn't too different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone here has made it easy for me. The adjustment has been
happening gradually.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia hasn't said for sure if Kennedy will bat second, but
Kennedy is comfortable there.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the spot I hit in the last couple of years,'' he said.
``It's a big responsibility right there, with Darin (Erstad)
getting on base in front of me and big Mo (Vaughn) behind me. It's
just a great spot to hit in.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting pitcher Kent Mercker was the beneficiary of Kennedy's
play on a sharply hit ball by Marvin Benard in the fifth inning.
Kennedy backhanded the ball on a short-hop and threw Benard out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was what I saw last year,'' said Mercker, who played for
the Cardinals last season. ``He's a good player. You don't get
picked in the first round and win minor league player of the year
for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong outing: Mercker took a big step toward winning a spot in
the starting rotation with five scoreless innings. He allowed two
hits and only one Giants baserunner got as far as third base, as
Mercker improved to 3-0 with a 3.78 ERA this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his ever-improving chances of starting the season in
the rotation, Mercker shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to worry about getting people out,'' he said. ``I
don't worry about making the team, if I'm going to start, play the
outfield or play catcher. I know what I can do. It's tough enough
to get hitters out at this level than to add pressure that if I
don't get guys out I'm going to be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival watch: Closer Troy Percival pitched a scoreless inning,
allowing one hit. He was clocked at 93 mph, but said he thought he
was up to 97 warming up in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warming up in the 'pen was the best I've felt all spring,''
Percival said. ``When I got in the game I overthrew a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival, coming off shoulder surgery, has an ERA of 5.14 in
seven spring games.

WHY BELTRE IS WORTH IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Adrian Beltre stands at third and rubs the
heal of his glove. As the pitcher begins his wind-up, the third
baseman takes a couple of quick, tiny steps to ready himself before
diving left to snare a grounder. He pops up and fires the ball to
first for an out.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre makes it look so wonderful and simple at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   It is why Los Angeles Dodgers managing partner, CEO and superfan
Bob Daly sat through 18 negotiating sessions, and held countless
phone conversations with Beltre's agent, Scott Boras.
</P>
<P>
   For as aggravating as the last five months could be for the
Dodgers - not to mention the fans - as Beltre sought free agency,
the real reason the Dodgers signed him wasn't because they felt bad
about the previous regime's illegal signing.
</P>
<P>
   Daly and the Dodgers singed Beltre because he's already one of
the premier third baseman in baseball. And with the ink dry on the
three-year, $5.05 million deal that will keep Beltre around for at
least the next five years, that can again be the focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has great talent, but he also has great instincts,'' said
utility infielder Jose Vizcaino, Beltre's closest confidant on the
Dodgers. ``That's going to help him a lot. It's like when (Rey)
Ordonez came up. He made all those plays because he had great
instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   It is talent and instinct and many other things that has Beltre
in his current on-field situation. With no help from Ponce De Leon,
Beltre enters his second consecutive season as a 20-year-old. He
just happens to be one of the most mature 20-year-olds around.
</P>
<P>
   In one year, Beltre's metamorphosis is incredible. An offseason
of workouts, playing in his native Dominican Republic and plain ol'
growing has changed his physical appearance. He's added muscle
mass, but only added a few pounds.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a transformation in Beltre's demeanor. He came to
spring training a year ago as a wide-eyed 19-year-old unsure of
what he should be doing, or what was expected of him.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, with confusion and turmoil surrounding him, he
maintained his calm. Through the chaos of an offseason filled with
interviews from the commissioner's office and the baseball world
focused on his case, Beltre remained composed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it comes from hanging around people that were older
than me when I was growing up,'' Beltre said. ``It's family and
friends. I saw the way they acted, and they were very mature. I
think it's the way it rubbed off on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson shielded Beltre in every possible way last
season. Johnson never criticized him despite his 29 errors, and
never showed concern about a one- or two-week slump at the plate.
When Beltre faltered in the second spot in the batting order,
Johnson quietly moved him back to seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre was handed the third base job, but didn't fully know what
to make of it. He thought he had to show he belonged during every
drill, every day. After hitting .275 with 15 homers, 67 RBI and 18
stolen bases, at, as it turns out, the age of 19, things are
different for Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to make a mistake last year because I didn't
want to go back to the minor leagues,'' Beltre said. ``This year
I'm more relaxed because I'm supposed to have my position so I'm
working on things I need to work on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked on a lot of things, like my throwing to first. I was
disappointed with it last year, and I'm working at hitting the ball
better to the opposite field, and being more relaxed and not try to
rush the play.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just Beltre's talent, though the soft hands, strong arm
and tremendous instinct don't hurt. It's Beltre's attitude which
made Daly so willing to negotiate a deal.
</P>
<P>
   During the five-month saga, Beltre never complained publicly. He
never threatened not to play for the Dodgers. He never showed any
disdain toward the organization that signed him at 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the type of player we're trying to build the
organization around,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said.
``We believe he has all the things we want. He's a hard worker,
he's a competitor, he wants to win, he carries himself in the right
way. He's the kind of player you can build an organization
around.''

AND THE WINNER IS ... FINAL FOUR, CBS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ The Final Four was going to be glamorous,
all right. In the same way tonight's Academy Awards gala would be
if all the nominated actresses arrived in baggy sweats and scuffed
sneakers, with their hair uncombed and their faces unmade.
</P>
<P>
   With fewer than five minutes remaining in Saturday's Midwest
Regional final, Michigan State trailed Iowa State by six points in
front of what appeared to be the entire population of East Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   A tournament that had lost its razzle in a rash of upsets was
watching its dazzle evaporate like cheap perfume.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans were by far the most esteemed team of the surviving
eight. They were the last No. 1 seed standing, so it had to give
the executives at CBS, which is televising the Final Four, severe
heartburn to see them tottering against Iowa State's ensemble cast.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS suits weren't the only ones swallowing hard. All around
The Palace there were Spartans fans wearing green faces and a lot
of them weren't even painted.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say you won't see any more stupefied expressions
tonight if a very pregnant Annette Bening's water breaks while
she's in her Shrine Auditorium seat than the collective look frozen
on the faces of the Michigan State fans when Cyclones standout
Marcus Fizer's basket gave Iowa State a 61-55 lead with 4:51 left.
</P>
<P>
   There are some people - mostly Iowa State fans - who will say
the fourth foul Fizer picked up, for setting an illegal screen on
Charlie Bell around midcourt less than a minute later, was an
abomination. No question it was the beginning of the end for the
Cyclones as they lost their momentum and soon thereafter, the game,
75-64.
</P>
<P>
   We say the greater crime would have been if the Final Four had
proceeded without Mateen Cleaves, who is breathtaking to watch even
when he's firing up shots so fast it's obvious the meter is running
out on his collegiate career.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3 senior missed eight of his 12 shots (and had five
turnovers against two assists), but when he's in the backcourt
that's beside the point. His leadership loomed large in the final
five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the years he has assisted fellow Flint products
Morris Peterson and Bell and in that decisive stretch they
justified his boundless confidence in them.
</P>
<P>
   It was a 3-pointer by Peterson that helped the Spartans get
their groove back. It pulled Michigan State to within 61-58 and
stopped the Cyclones' path of destruction. Iowa State proceeded to
cough up the ball twice and miss its next seven shots, including
two gimme layups by its starriest players, Jamaal Tinsley and
Fizer.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson and Bell can't even claim the highest popularity rating
in their hometown - Cleaves is easily the largest luminary. But
every time they touched the ball down the stretch it was gold:
Between them, Peterson and Bell accounted for all the Spartans'
points in an 11-0 run.
</P>
<P>
   When Peterson scored the fourth and fifth points of his
seven-point burst with a dunk off an alley-oop pass by Cleaves to
put MSU ahead 64-61, it got so loud inside The Palace you couldn't
hear yourself gasp.
</P>
<P>
   In a scintillating stretch of three minutes, 44 seconds, the
Cyclones were snuffed out and the Final Four was saved. No offense
against either Iowa State or Wisconsin, a winner earlier in the day
over Purdue, but an NCAA semifinal game pitting them would have
been as riveting as the competition for the Oscar for Best Sound
Editing.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans, who advanced to the Final Four last year, have
been every bit the front-runner for college basketball's most
coveted prize as ``American Beauty'' has been for the movie
industry's. So it was Michigan State's win Saturday which kept
alive the illusion that the so-called experts know of what they
speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played a better quality game during the last five
minutes,'' Iowa State coach Larry Eustachy said, ``and that is the
story.''
</P>
<P>
   If anybody deserved the chance to add another chapter to his
fable of a career, it's Cleaves. He could have turned pro after his
junior year. Cleaves chose more memories over lots of money, only
to injure his right foot before the start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   He missed 13 games and much sleep wondering if he'd be able to
regain his fabulous form.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves came back for his senior season expressly because he
wanted to lead the Spartans to the Final Four and beyond. He can't
say he was confident throughout Saturday's dogfight that he'd get
it done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did get a tad bit nervous, to tell you the truth,'' Cleaves
said.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say a lot of people knew the feeling.

SPEED TRUCK DRIVER USING CHALLENGE TO FIND MISSING STUDENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIMOTHY HADDOCK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When UCLA freshman Michael Negrete disappeared
from his dorm room the weekend before finals in December, campus
police and the FBI began searching for the missing teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   In the four months since Negrete's disappearance, neither has
been able to locate him. Now Speed Truck series driver Chris Hines
is getting involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Mechanix Wear Speed Truck Challenge opened Saturday at the
Orange Show in San Bernardino. Coincidentally, it was the same day
as Negrete's birthday. He turned 19.
</P>
<P>
   Hines displayed Negrete's picture in the bed of his race truck
in the hopes someone would recognize the missing music student from
San Diego and end months of heartache and frustration for the
Negrete family.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the 37-year-old from Chandler, Ariz., knows the chances
of finding a missing person are slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality of finding children is very difficult,'' Hines
said. ``I want to try to raise awareness rather than find kids. But
you never know with an adult case like this. Maybe something else
happened. And maybe he'll say to himself, `Man, I need to get a
hold of my parents.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hines and his wife, Donna, who volunteers for the Nation's
Missing Children and Center for Missing Adults in Glendale, Ariz.,
select a different person, usually a child, to publicize in each
race. The Speed Truck Challenge makes stops throughout the
Southwest, including Phoenix International Raceway, Mesa Marin
Raceway in Bakersfield and Irwindale Speedway. The Hines pick a
missing person from the communities in which the series visits in
its weekly races.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to carrying a picture of Negrete on his truck, Hines
also invited the Negrete family to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little surprised,'' said Mary Negrete, Michael's
mother. ``We're not really into racing. But it was a nice thing to
do. We are just looking for that one person who knows something
about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Negrete, who did not have a car, was last heard from in
the early morning of Dec. 10, 1999. He was playing a computer game
with another student and logged off at 3:40 a.m. When Negrete's
roommate awoke the next morning at 9, Negrete was not in the room.
</P>
<P>
   The Negrete Web site is
www.four-schools.com/negrete/negrete.htm. Additionally, there is a
link to the Web site at UCLA.edu.

TOUGH OFF-SEASON REGIMEN HELPS FUEL KERRY WOOD'S RAPID COMEBACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. _ Kerry Wood suffered through a long, lonely, boring
off-season.
</P>
<P>
   He'd get up in the morning and make the 25-minute drive from his
Scottsdale, Ariz., home to the Chicago Cubs' training complex for
an intense, grueling workout. By himself.
</P>
<P>
   He'd go back to his sparsely furnished, four-bedroom house to
spend time. By himself.
</P>
<P>
   He'd take his bass boat out to the lake to get in a little
fishing. By himself.
</P>
<P>
   He'd repeat the process, day after day, week after week. By
himself.
</P>
<P>
   He made it home to Texas just twice, for Thanksgiving and
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   His buddies from Irving, and the ones he went to high school
with in Grand Prairie, the guys he used to hang out with after the
baseball season, didn't understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my friends back home were saying, `Why are you moving out
to Arizona to live by yourself?' '' Wood said. ``I moved out here
because I didn't know a lot of people out here. I knew I could get
my work done and not have any distractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I moved out here because my career was on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood is threatened by a pitcher's nightmare: a catastrophic
elbow injury. He tore the ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow
during spring training last year. Now, he's back in spring training
almost a year after ligament replacement surgery attempting to
resurrect his once promising career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan on coming back with the same stuff,'' Wood said. ``I
plan on being the same pitcher as before.''
</P>
<P>
   The pitcher he used to be seemed headed for a Hall of Fame
career almost from the time he arrived in the majors two months
short of his 21st birthday in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5, 220-pound right-hander with the upper-90 mph
fastball, hard curve and biting slider went 13-6 with a 2.40
earned-run average. He struck out 233 batters in 166 2/3 innings,
including a record-tying 20 against the Houston Astros in just his
fifth major-league start in his rookie-of-the-year season.
</P>
<P>
   His heroes while growing up in Irving were Nolan Ryan and Roger
Clemens, two other big, hard-throwing Texans. There seemed no
reason why he wouldn't follow in their legendary bootsteps.
</P>
<P>
   Then his seemingly indestructible, magical right arm failed him.
He missed the final month of the season because of a sprained ulnar
collateral ligament. In spring training it tore, and Wood faced the
three words pitchers most dread: ``Tommy John'' surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure, named after the former pitcher who was the first
to undergo the surgery in 1974, involves removing the damaged
ligament and replacing it with a tendon from another part of the
body. In Wood's case, it was a tendon from his right forearm.
</P>
<P>
   Some pitchers thrive after the surgery. John won 164 of his 288
career victories after having the surgery. Others, though, such as
former Cincinnati All-Star Jose Rijo, never make it back.
</P>
<P>
   Wood knows the success stories. He knows the failures. He knows
if he wanted to be one of the former, he had to change, to work
harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely a slap in the face,'' he said. ``It was a
wakeup call. You go from thinking you're invincible, then
everything's taken away from you and you're starting over from
scratch.''  &LR; subheds:Making changes  &LR; body:Before the injury, Wood
thrived with natural talent. After dominating batters during the
season, he'd go home to Texas and hang out with his buddies.
Conditioning was not exactly a priority.
</P>
<P>
   After the surgery, he spent virtually the entire off-season at
his Arizona home and changed his workout routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he said. ``I actually had one. I actually worked out.
I really went after it.''
</P>
<P>
   It shows. Wood lost 15-18 pounds. He replaced much of the baby
fat with muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great,'' Wood said. ``Usually you hate conditioning
when you come to spring training; that's the worst part of your
day. I haven't had any problems. I feel like I have good endurance
and my legs feel strong beneath me ... I feel like my arm strength
is pretty close.''
</P>
<P>
   The few batters he has faced this spring might say very close.
</P>
<P>
   Wood began throwing off a mound early in camp, hitting the low
90s on the radar gun. On March 13, the one-year anniversary of the
day he tore the ligament, he faced live batters for the first time.
He threw 10 modified curveballs to catcher Jose Molina, then threw
37 pitches to minor-leaguers Chris Petersen and Mike Amrhein. Eight
were put in play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every pitch was awesome,` Molina said. ``He was spotting it in
and out.''
</P>
<P>
   Five days later he started against the Chicago White Sox in an
exhibition and his fastball hit 97 mph on the radar gun.
</P>
<P>
   Friday he pitched two innings against Milwaukee's Triple-A team.
Although he allowed three runs and five hits, the more important
statistic was that he was throwing 94-96 mph, saying after the game
he felt good.
</P>
<P>
   Wood has yet to attempt throwing his slider or a hard breaking
curve, but by any measure he is well ahead of schedule. Not
everyone thinks that's such a great idea. Like Wood, St. Louis
Cardinals right-hander Matt Morris had Tommy John surgery in early
April last year. He hasn't been back on a mound yet, and is aiming
for a return in late June or early July.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't impressed by Wood's early outings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's stupid, to be honest,'' Morris said. ``Everyone you
talk to says a good 18 months is about what you need. I can pitch
in a game today, but it's not going to help me tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs, naturally, don't place a high value on Morris'
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will listen to the input from licensed physicians,'' general
manager Ed Lynch said.  &LR; subheds:Trying to be careful  &LR; body:Wood is
so eager, he wants to be back yesterday. Manager Don Baylor has
talked about Wood making it back by June, although he later amended
it to say he thinks it will be sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're taking every precaution they can, and honestly I feel
like at some points they've been too cautious,'' Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor knows he needs Wood pitching well if the Cubs are going
to contend. The Cubs made the playoffs with him pitching every
fifth day in '98. When they didn't have Wood last year, they fell
to 67-95.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor also knows Wood is the future. He doesn't want to rush
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking far ahead into his future,'' Baylor said. ``That
will be the determining factor, not just throwing him out there to
win games this year. The two guys who are his role models are Roger
Clemens and Nolan Ryan. I'd like for him to fulfill those kind of
dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood, for now, is having a hard time being patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to one thing: I'm the only one in the world who
knows how my arm feels,'' he said. ``If my arm's bothering me, I'm
not going to go out and pitch. But if it's not bothering me, I'm
going to push it and get my work done to get back on the mound.
That's my job, to get back on the mound as healthy as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what the long, lonely, boring off-season was all about.

STRONG OUTING PUTS CORDERO CLOSE TO ROSTER SPOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRADENTON, Fla. _ Francisco Cordero, continuing to impress
manager Johnny Oates, all but nailed down a spot on the Opening Day
roster with 1 2/3 scoreless innings in a 5-5 tie with the
Pittsburgh Pirates yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Cordero has now not allowed a run in six appearances covering
82/3 scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was up a little bit today, but he's got enough stuff to get
by,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Cordero's chances of making the team improved considerably when
Oates revealed he was strongly leaning toward going with a
seven-man bullpen and a 12-man pitching staff for Opening Day. That
leaves room for both Mike Venafro and Cordero in a bullpen that
already includes right-handers John Wetteland, Jeff Zimmerman and
Tim Crabtree, and left-handers Matt Perisho and Mike Munoz.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is I would probably use that 12th pitcher more
than I would that 14th regular,'' said Oates, who went with a
12-man staff for most of last season.
</P>
<P>
   If Oates does go with 12 pitchers, it leaves a crowded field
battling for the final remaining spot on the bench next to catcher
Bill Haselman, infielder Frank Catalanotto and outfielder Chad
Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   Oates indicated he has a preference for someone who can play
shortstop, which would give an edge to Scott Sheldon or Edwin Diaz
over outfielders Jason McDonald, Scarborough Green and Mike Simms.
</P>
<P>
   Much depends on Venafro being ready for Opening Day. Venafro,
sidelined for most of the spring with a finger injury, made his
first appearance in an exhibition game yesterday, allowing three
hits and a walk in one inning of work.
</P>
<P>
   Oates was encouraged but said Venafro was not as close to being
ready as closer John Wetteland, who has also been limited this
spring by a strained groin muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were opening the season today, Wetteland would pitch,
Venafro would not,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Oates said pitching coach Dick Bosman, ``thinks no
problem. He's seen enough stuff that with three or four more
outings, he'll be right on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his outing, Venafro said, ``It went well ... little fatigued
... the finger felt fine. Performance-wise, beggars can't be
choosers, but I've only got one way to go. I guess that tells you
what I think of my performance.'' International push The Rangers
are making a run at Cuban pitcher Adrian ``El Duquecito''
Hernandez, the latest and hottest defector/free agent from that
island. Rangers scouting director Chuck McMichael said there is
interest, although the early asking price is a little too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're asking for multi millions and a major-league
contract,'' McMichael said. ``I'd like to say they won't get it,
but I might be wrong. I've discussed the parameters of an offer
with them, but I haven't put an offer on the table. I'm due to talk
with them on Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez is known as ``El Duquecito'' because he is similar in
style to Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez (no relation) of the New
York Yankees. But McMichael said he's more likely to start at
Double A rather than the majors.
</P>
<P>
   McMichael has had a good spring, signing four Dominican Republic
pitchers, including Omar Beltre and Jose Dominguez. Both are 17,
6-foot-3 and can throw 90-94 mph. Briefly Justin Thompson, taking
another weary step on the road to recovering from shoulder surgery,
threw 30 pitches in a simulated game in Port Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Oliver, John Wetteland, Jeff Zimmerman and Matt Perisho
are scheduled to pitch against the Philadelphia Phillies today in
Port Charlotte. Tim Crabtree and Mike Munoz are scheduled to pitch
in a minor-league game because the Rangers are running out of
innings in their exhibition games.

HACKETT SAYS USC QUARTERBACK PALMER LOOKS `OK'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC ran a tightly controlled scrimmage Saturday
afternoon to work on its running game, but it also gave fans a
first chance to look at quarterback Carson Palmer in a game-like
environment since he suffered a broken collarbone last season.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer completed 6 of 7 passes for 81 yards in a solid effort
while backup Mike Van Raaphorst was 5 of 12 for 40 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he looked OK,'' Paul Hackett, the USC coach, said of
Palmer. ``He certainly didn't have a sensational day. I thought our
runners ran the ball well.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore tailback Sultan McCullough gained 59 yards on 14
carries, including a 40-yard run and Malaefou MacKenzie gained 40
yards on 9 carries.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans' first-string defense looked slightly ahead of the
offense, with Hackett singling out linebacker Zeke Moreno and
defensive tackle Ryan Nielsen. A surprising standout was linebacker
John Cousins, a transfer from West Los Angeles College.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought John Cousins showed up a couple times nice ... he's
got a suddenness to him,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what we were trying to accomplish, working on the
running game and the basic fundamentals, I'm very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem area was penalties. The Trojans had 11 during the
scrimmage, which was reminiscent of last season, when they had 128
in 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm vowing we will improve in that area,'' Hackett said.

   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Monday, March 27:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-ELECTION (Moscow) _ Acting President Vladimir Putin
appeared to hold a commanding lead over his 10 rivals in Russia's
second presidential election Sunday, according to early results
from exit polls conducted across the nation's 11 time zones. But it
was less clear whether he was attracting the 50 percent of voters
he needed to win the election outright and avoid a runoff. By
Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-VOICES (Moscow) _ Russian reaction to the presidential
vote. By Celestine Bohlen.

   CLINTON-ASSAD (Islamabad, Pakistan) _ President Clinton meets in
Geneva with the Syrian president, Hafez Assad, in hopes of
restarting peace talks between Syria and Israel. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   POPE (Jerusalem) _ With 86 shuffling steps, Pope John Paul
Sunday approached the Western Wall, reached out a trembling hand to
touch its cool stone and, as is the custom of Jewish visitors,
tucked into a crevice a note to God. Then he made the sign of the
cross at the most sacred site in Judaism, and a hush carpeted the
plaza as the moment sunk in. The pope's note bore the message of
reconciliation that has been the public theme of his six-day
personal pilgrimage. By Deborah Sontag and Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   UGANDA-CULT-LEADER (Kabumba, Uganda) _ For a man so devoted to
God, the idea must have seemed so right, so real. Three women,
meeting Joseph Kibwetere for the first time, told him that the
Virgin Mary had led them to him and that he had been anointed to
help them spread the word of God. It was, he believed, his reward
for a lifetime of piety and prayer. It was, his family now says,
the beginning of his unrepentant turn away from the faith that had
made him a model man and toward an obsession that would make him a
murderer. By Henri E. Cauvin.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-SABOTAGE (London) _ Sabotage at a British nuclear plant
increases pressure for the government to close the site. By Alan
Cowell.
</P>
<P>
   TYRANTS-SWIMMING-POOLS (Istanbul, Turkey) _ When Ethem Erkoc
decided to go into the swimming pool business, he had no idea that
he would one day be known as poolmaker to tyrants. It just turned
out that way. Asked how he assembled his unusual client list, which
includes Saddam Hussein and Moammar Gadhafi, Erkoc said he assumes
that authoritarian leaders chat about things like swimming pools:
``Maybe it's not an official club, but they communicate,'' he said.
``When they get together, one might say to the other, `Nice pool,
who built it for you?''' By Stephen Kinzer.

   INDIAN-ARTIFACTS (Suitland, Md.) _ A treasure trove of American
Indian artifacts and objects is being quietly trucked from a Bronx
warehouse to the Smithsonian Institution's new Cultural Resources
Center under the respectful scrutiny of members of the surviving
tribes, their population having rebounded from the 250,000 total of
a century ago to near 2 million. By Francis X. Clines.

   HOUSE-CONTROL (Washington) _ The contest for control of the

   USEDBOOK-BOOM (Undated) _ The used book market used to be a
musty corner of the book industry. Now, with the Internet, it is

emergence of Alibris, a virtual used bookseller with $60 million in
Silicon Valley money and more people in its executive suite than

Internet economy is almost impossible to discuss rationally in most
quarters. Try telling someone hit by the money truck, that the
making of millions overnight does not justify the present means _
like poor business practices, rejection of even sensible government
oversight and early profit-taking. Say that out loud and you can
live the experience of clearing a room in 10 seconds flat. But it
appears that something is shifting. Venture investors, the fuel of

   ABC-NEWS-MEDIA (Undated) _ ABC news shows have been using the
mascot for Pets.com _ for mock interviews on Nightline and Good
Morning America _ and not saying that ABC's owner, Disney, owns 5
percent of the Web site. The incidents demonstrate the difficulties
of news divisions in policing potential conflicts of interest these
days, when TV networks, or their owners, take stakes in Internet
companies by swapping equity in such start-ups for advertising

   CATHOLIC-VOTE _ WASHINGTON _ It has been three weeks since Gov.
George W. Bush wrote to the nation's foremost Catholic leaders to
express regret for speaking at Bob Jones University. But
Republicans are worried over alienating a powerful voter
constituency and Democrats are no longer taking them for granted.
(Heath, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   OSCAR COVERAGE
</P>
<P>
   OSCAR-MAIN _ Our Oscar show review: from host Billy Crystal to
the big winners. Included are show highlights, best moments, best
speeches, etc. (Jubera/BLongino, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 30.
ETA: 12:30 a.m.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   OSCAR-FASHION _ Who wore what, who looked good, who did not.
(Walton, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). ETA: 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   OSCAR-IMPACT _ What Sunday night's winners actually won. For
instance, a best picture win for ``American Beauty'' translates
into how much more box office? And last year, for instance, Gwyneth
Paltrow's Oscar meant she could ask roughly $8 million more per
movie. (StMurray, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 12. ETA: 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   OSCAR-SONG _ For Monday office talk. Billy Crystal's back and

   ENTERTAINMENT
</P>
<P>
   TV-HEPBURN _ Let's face it: Jennifer Love Hewitt's breasts are
as famous as she is. So it's no wonder some Hollywood insiders
snickered when Hewitt wanted to play the glamorous, stick-thin
Audrey Hepburn in a TV movie. After all, Hepburn was flat-chested.
Hewitt is, well... we all know what Hewitt is. (Thompson, Palm
Beach Post) MOVED

</P>
<P>
   WWII-MUSEUM _ TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ From the front lines in France
came a birthday present for 2-year-old Dan Buschhoff _ a letter
from his Uncle Fred, who was clearing a path toward Germany with
the 101st Airborne Division. In swirling blue ink on thin brown
paper, Fred Buschhoff made an eloquent argument for waging a brutal
war in the name of equality and opportunity, and he made a lasting
impression on his young nephew. ``It means an even chance for every
man to get a job, a home, a meal, or to raise a family free from
the fear of destitution,'' Fred Buschhoff wrote in the Jan. 5,
1945, letter. ``It applies to big things and little things and is
one more important reason that we are fighting today. Protect it,
cherish it, and nourish it always for it's your birthright and your
future.'' ( Kiehl, Palm Beach Post) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   OPED/EDITORIAL
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ I really don't wish to pile on Ricky Williams.
He's down. He had a miserable rookie season. He's been hurt. He's
been homesick for Austin. He's also a multi-millionaire. He plays a
boys game for a living. He's rung up more magazine covers in the
last two years than Bill Clinton, and without a write-up from
Kenneth Starr. Sure, it it was a bad year for the Heisman Trophy
winner, and last week has probably the worst. Williams had to
apologize to New Orleans and his team for comments in Sports
Illustrated about the town and the Saints. Once again, I wish not
to pile on. But I read the same article that has the Bayou
steaming. And what bothered me about it was something entirely
different: Ricky leaves half-eaten food on his floor. (Young, Waco
Tribune-Herald.) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   EZZARD-COLUMN _ I am not married to a dot-com man, or even a
low-tech man. When it comes to our North Georgia vineyard, where my
husband John gets to know his eight acres of wine-grape vines
personally, I am married to a no-tech man.(Ezzard, Atlanta

Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE TIPPING POINT'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Malcolm Gladwell (Little, Brown, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We were skeptical when we picked this up, having become adept
over the years at detecting books that aren't about anything
(they're like the emperor's new clothes _ they try to dazzle you,
but there's nothing to them). It wasn't long, however, before we
were hooked. If the premise does grow a bit thin _ Gladwell sounds
at times like an author inventing reasons to rattle on _ for the
most part it is thought-provoking and presented with an appealing
eye toward popular culture. The ``tipping point'' of the title is
the moment at which something becomes an epidemic, a word Gladwell
applies to fashion trends, fads, crime statistics, the success of a
bestselling book. His examination of how this happens is
dumbfoundingly interesting, and it includes discussion of the
resurgence of Hush Puppies (the shoes) in the mid-1990s, the
phenomenon of ``Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood'' (the book)
when it was released in paperback in 1998, and the ``word-of-mouth
epidemic'' created by Paul Revere (the silversmith) in 1775.
Gladwell works for ``The New Yorker,'' in which the tipping-point
theory made its first appearance. &QL; 
 &UR; ``I WILL BEAR WITNESS: A DIARY OF THE NAZI YEARS, 1942-1945'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Victor Klemperer (Random House, $29.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Two Jewish rumors: There had been mass murders in Poland in
the course of withdrawals. On the other hand, Jews had been allowed
out of Hungary after a Hungarian agreement with the USA. We
consider Point 1 very likely; Point 2 can be correct only if
Hungary has broken away from Germany. Did it? We are tapping in the
dark.'' Klemperer, the son of a Berlin rabbi, wrote this in his
diary during the hot, humid summer of 1944, as he and his wife
lived through the Nazi terror in Dresden. His remarkable diaries
(the first volume, which covers 1933 to 1941, was published in
1998) re-create the confusion, fear, humiliation and emotional
claustrophobia that ruled the lives of German Jews. Included in
this volume are rumors of the crimes at Auschwitz and other camps,
the fragile link to survival that Klemperer's marriage to an
``Aryan'' afforded him and an account of the bombing of Dresden.
It's a riveting and invaluable glimpse of what life was like for a
Jew living in Nazi Germany. Klemperer died in 1960. &QL; 
 &UR; ``A GARDEN IN LUCCA'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Paul Gervais (Hyperion, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is there anyone left in America who does not own a villa in the
hills of Tuscany? Certainly the American literati have established
a presence there, the better to write books that make the rest of
us back home weak-kneed with envy. A prerequisite of this new life
in Italy, it seems, is that the villa in question must need work _
Frances Mayes and her boyfriend renovated theirs in her book
``Under the Tuscan Sun,'' and now Gervais (his novel
``Extraordinary People'' was nominated for a PEN/Faulkner award in
1991) and his companion do it here. The twist Gervais offers is
that the huge house they bought in 1982 in the small town of Massa
Macinaia in Lucca province came with its own huge, run-down garden.
This was new to Gervais, who grew up in New England and who knew
nothing of gardening, so he learned on the job, making lots of
mistakes until he hit upon a plan. We know he was successful,
because his book opens with a California horticultural foundation
booking his garden for its next tour. That's right _ foundation
members traveled 7,000 miles to see it. This is not as seductive as
the Mayes book, but it will make you jealous just the same.  &QL; 
 &UR; ``GOOD BREEDING'' &QL; 
 &UR; Photographs by Yann Arthus-Bertrand (Abrams, $49.50)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Do not laugh. No, do not laugh. Yes, those are pigs on the cover
and they are handsome devils, don't you think? All of the animals
in this book are handsome, because they are bred to be.
Arthus-Bertrand offers grand portraits of prizewinning domestic
livestock (sheep, cattle, goats, horses and swine) posed with their
very proud owners, breeders or trainers. The creatures are
astonishing. They are also a little _ well, odd, to the untrained
eye. Huge in just about every respect, if you know what we mean.
Dauntingly larger than the human beings who stand with them
(there's a Blonde D'Aquitaine bull on Page 47 that looks like it
could take out Manhattan). Muscled, veined, groomed and dandy, they
pose as if they are fully aware of just how excellent they are.
This is, in case you have not surmised it by now, a strange but
endearing book. You might be tempted to laugh (but don't) as you
look through it, but you quickly get caught up in the spirit of the
thing. Except when you see the pigs. You can laugh at them.  &QL;

 &HT;    RELIGION, NOT POLITICS, REIGN ON POPE'S LAST DAY IN HOLY LAND
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM Pope John Paul II Sunday ended his Holy Land
pilgrimage with images of piety and reconciliation whose quiet
eloquence could be plainly heard above the usual din of political
and religious acrimony.
</P>
<P>
   The 79-year-old, hunched and hobbled pontiff looked small,
praying at the base of the Western Wall, sacred to Jews. He laid a
trembling hand on the huge stones set in place in the time of
Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   On the hilltop above, he viewed the rock where the Muslim
Prophet Mohammed is said to have risen to heaven. Nearby, he slowly
bowed to kiss the stone of Jesus' tomb in the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre.
</P>
<P>
   The three sites are near each other in Jerusalem's walled Old
City, for centuries the focal point of religious fervor and
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``These have been days of intense emotion, a time when our soul
has been stirred not only by the memory of what God has done but by
his very presence, walking with us once again in the Land of
Christ's birth, death and resurrection,'' he said during a mass in
the cavernous, dim, Church of the Holy Sepulchre.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when this most media savvy pope was scheduled for a rest
before the flight home, he gave Israeli security officials an
unexpected task. He returned to the church, praying alone and
without any cameras at Catholicism's most sacred place.
</P>
<P>
   The six-day visit to Israel and the Palestinian National
Authority was the highlight of the pope's year 2000 ``Holy Year,''
dedicated to reconciliation between the church and other faiths.
</P>
<P>
   It was historic from the beginning. This is only the second time
in history that a Roman Catholic pope visited the land where Christ
was born and crucified. It is the first visit by a pope since the
Vatican established diplomatic ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The visit quickly became the object of the region's political
disputes. Israelis confronted the pope with frequent reminders of
their claim to Jerusalem. A Muslim cleric walked out of an
interfaith meeting with the pope Thursday after debating who should
control Jerusalem with a rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Minister Haim Ramon acknowledged that officials kept two
prominent Palestinian politicians from Sunday's mass because Israel
wanted to show that it controlled Jerusalem politics.
</P>
<P>
   A Muslim cleric asked the pope to support Palestinian claims to
Jerusalem Sunday during the pope's visit to the Dome of the Rock
Mosque. The pope listened quietly. A few Arab and Jewish hecklers
tried to disrupt events Sunday, but many more were supportive.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, he remained steadfast in his mission of
reconciliation and personal pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
   During the trip, his words broke little new theological or
political ground, but he provided an album of indelible pictures
for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   He met weeping Holocaust survivors from his native Poland and
said the church was ``deeply saddened'' by Catholic persecution of
Jews.
</P>
<P>
   He told Palestinian refugees, who feel neglected and mistreated,
that the world must pay attention to their ``torment.'' He rode
through the tense, mostly-Muslim city of Nazareth and showed the
beleaguered Christian Arab minority that they had support from the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The politics did not cease. Sunday, Palestinians sent their
flag, suspended by party balloons, into the sky above the Old City.
</P>
<P>
   But, the pope's hosts seemed to subordinate their political
agendas if not set them aside to acknowledge that something great
had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt it was an historical visit to the Holy Land. I
believe this visit brings to an end the era of conflict, the era of
dispute and the era of war between Christianity and Judaism . . .
after 2000 years,'' said Ramon, who coordinated the visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can say we stayed several days with a great man,'' said
Faisal Husseini, the PLO representative in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   At the Western Wall, the tight security for the papal visit
delayed prayer for many. Some had criticisms, but acknowledged a
reverence.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that Israel is too eager to please the
gentiles,'' said Orna Cohen, 44, of Jerusalem. ``But we lack the
historical perspective. Maybe we can't understand the importance.
Time will tell.''
</P>
<P>
   The final day was not the top news in Israel. That went to the
summit talks between President Clinton and Syrian President Hafez
Assad. But, each stop on the pope's visit took on historic
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Many visitors to the Wall leave small prayers folded between the
cracks in the stone. The pope, after praying to the wall, left a
large page asking God to forgive Catholics for misdeeds against
Jews. The paper was taken to Jerusalem's Holocaust memorial for
display.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   The pope has talked about the year 2000 since he started his
pontificate in 1978. He intended to illustrate these goals through
a trip that would follow the development of monotheism and retrace
the steps of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month he asked God for forgiveness for Catholic
mistreatment of Jews and others.
</P>
<P>
   Moslems remember Catholicism for the brutality of the
church-ordered medieval crusades.
</P>
<P>
   Jews remember Catholicism for the murder and torture of the
Spanish Inquisition and the silence by many Catholic leaders during
the Nazi Holocaust..
</P>
<P>
   John Paul (cq, no II on second reference) has lived a life
emblematic of the twentieth century witnessing the Holocaust and
Communism in his native Poland, working as an actor, stone cutter
and poet.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is an ailing pope who shakes with the symptoms of
Parkinson's disease, though Vatican officials do not confirm that
diagnosis. This trip his 91st as pope and by far more than any
other could be the lasting legacy of his papacy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that legacy could vary according to who is viewing
it. For his Catholic followers, his visit to the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre Sunday may be the most important.
</P>
<P>
   ``This the highlight. It is the most spiritual. Of all the trips
of the pope, this takes us to the roots of our faith. Spiritually
for Christians, the Holy Sepulchre is where it all began because of
the resurrection,'' said Cardinal Adam Maida, of Detroit, who
attended the mass.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of the pope, he described him as a ``mystical and
spiritual man. The pilgrimage has brought that out like never
before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is unsteady on his feet. He appears weak, but this has
probably been the strongest moment of his pontificate,'' Maida
said.

 &HT;    Much ado over Catholic vote
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been three weeks since Gov. George W. Bush
wrote to the nation's foremost Catholic leaders to express regret
for speaking at Bob Jones University. But Republicans are worried
over alienating a powerful voter constituency and Democrats are no
longer taking them for granted.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Republican National Committee Chairman Jim
Nicholson reignited the battle over the Catholic vote, calling on
Vice President Al Gore to repudiate two abortion-rights groups that
want the Vatican to lose its non-voting United Nations status. The
Democratic National Committee fired back with a reminder of Bush's
Feb. 2 visit to Bob Jones University, an evangelical school with an
anti-Catholic philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, stung by the
uproar over who should be the House chaplain, appointed a Roman
Catholic priest for the first time in that body's 211-year history.
</P>
<P>
   It's all much ado about politics. The last time Catholicism
figured so prominently in an American election was when John F.
Kennedy ran for the presidency in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason that the Catholic vote is so important in American
politics today is because of where it's found,'' said Steven
Wagner, a Republican pollster and author of, ``Catholics &AMP;
Evangelicals: Can They Be Allies? `` part of a series in Crisis
Magazine, a Catholic periodical. ``While Catholics are a greater
percentage of the population in New England, there are more of them
in the states of the upper Midwest and these are the states that
will determine who gets elected president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   About a third of voters in any given presidential election are
Catholics. They have traditionally voted for Democrats, but the
tide is shifting, especially among white Roman Catholics who
regularly attend mass, said Wagner, who is not working for any
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very salient moment,'' said Deal Hudson, editor of
Crisis. ``Either that slow migration is going to pick up and
continue or it might begin to reverse.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll by Pew Research Center for the People and the
Press found Bush and Gore evenly split among white Roman Catholic
voters. The two candidates are preparing for battle in
heavily-Catholic swing states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania.
Speculation over who Bush might choose as a running mate includes
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, who is Catholic and also pro-choice
and so might help Bush win over social moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Appealing to Catholics is going to take more than charges of
anti-Catholic bias, said Patrick Scully, spokesman for the Catholic
League for Religious and Civil Rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think that there will be a preponderance of issues
taken into consideration for a Catholic voter come November,'' he
said. ``I don't think a Catholic voter is going to go into the
voting booth and say, 'I won't vote for this candidate because of
the Bob Jones and the House chaplain situation.'''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were quick to attack House leaders when they passed
over the Rev. Timothy O'Brien, a Catholic priest who had the
support of an 18-member bipartisan search committee. Republicans
complained that Democrats were exploiting religion for political
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope Speaker Hastert's actions and words will help put an
end to the divisive tactics of playing upon religious fears and
pitting people against one another for political gain,'' said Bush
spokesman Scott McClellan, echoing that theme Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Reed, former head of the Christian Coalition, now a
political consultant, said the furor over Catholics has been a wake
up call for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican party has undergone a quiet metamorphosis over
the last decade,'' he said. ``We used to call these folks Reagan
Democrats, but they're not Democrats anymore, they're Republicans.
I think the Catholic vote is going to be very important for
Republicans in November.''

 &HT;    Hewitt's doubts in her dream role echo Hepburn's own
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Let's face it: Jennifer Love Hewitt's breasts
are as famous as she is.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no wonder some Hollywood insiders snickered when Hewitt
wanted to play the glamorous, stick-thin Audrey Hepburn in a TV
movie. After all, Hepburn was flat-chested. Hewitt is, well... we
all know what Hewitt is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's been something since I did those ``I Know What You
Did Last Summer'' movies where I wore those tiny tops, and stuff,''
Hewitt says, giggling.
</P>
<P>
   While filming The Audrey Hepburn Story, ABC's three-hour
biography debuting tonight, Hewitt wore a sports bra and an ace
bandage in several scenes to keep her assets hidden. ``Costume
designers have all the technology the aerospace industry has,''
jokes director Steve Robman. ``They did a wonderful job.''
</P>
<P>
   But will viewers think the former ``Party of Five'' star is
wonderful as the legendary actress?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited about turning on a new generation to Audrey
Hepburn,'' says Kimberly Rubin, the film's executive producer. ``We
think people will take (Hewitt) seriously and not just as a teen
queen.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not an easy job. Hepburn, who starred in such classics as
``Roman Holiday,'' ``Sabrina,'' ``Love in the Afternoon,'' ``Two
for the Road,'' ``Funny Face'' and ``Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' was
one of film's most beloved icons. With her eye-catching Givenchy
flair, she practically created the chic gamine. Her incredibly
influential look also helped set the style for the reed-like
fashion models so popular today.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is the one woman who had every single thing a woman should
be,'' the 21-year-old Hewitt says. ``She was goofy, funny,
beautiful, smart, elegant, graceful, sexy. Any word you could think
of, she was it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hewitt wasn't sure if she could play Hepburn. She read the
criticism. And it stung. A lot. ``Two weeks before the movie
started, I was bawling and crying because all these stories were
coming out saying I couldn't pull it off, I wasn't talented enough,
I wasn't pretty enough, how dare I play Audrey Hepburn and there
was the whole chest thing,'' she remembers. ``I have thick skin,
but not that thick. It was hurtful to me and I told my mom, `I
don't think I'm pretty enough and I'm afraid of what people are
going to say.' That's when she took out the script and pointed out
a line with me as Audrey saying, `I don't think I'm talented
enough, pretty enough and I'm afraid of what people are going to
say.' She said, `For Audrey's sake, you have to do this movie and
you'll be great in it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, who is co-executive producer of the film, has idolized
Hepburn ever since her mom showed her ``Breakfast at Tiffany's''
when she was 7. ```This is who you should grow up to be,''' Hewitt
recalls her mom saying about Hepburn's character, the ever-charming
Holly Golightly. ``I was absolutely captivated. I didn't understand
the story, but I could tell you every word she said and every move
she made. I was hooked ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, starring in The Audrey Hepburn Story has been Hewitt's
dream project for years. Fortunately for Hewitt, Kimberly Rubin, a
veteran TV movie producer, had the same dream. Rubin pitched the
idea to several networks for eight years, but all of them passed.
</P>
<P>
   But when Rubin met Hewitt to talk about a different project, she
was delighted to learn both were fascinated with Hepburn's
Cinderella life story. Once Hewitt signed on, ABC gave the $7
million film (most of which was spent on Hewitt's salary and the
enormous costume budget) the green light. ``Had we not had Love
Hewitt, I don't know if this movie was going to be made,'' Rubin
says.
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, ABC chose to only focus on the first 32 years of
Hepburn's life. The network didn't seek cooperation from Hepburn's
family, however. ``There are Byzantine legal complications when you
do that,'' director Robman explains. ABC did show the final version
to Sean Ferrer, Hepburn's oldest son. ``He said it respected and
celebrated his mother's memory,'' Robman says.
</P>
<P>
   The film starts with Hepburn shooting ``Breakfast of Tiffany's''
famous opening scene in which she's munching on a sweet roll in
front of New York's famed jewelry store. But Hepburn gags the
moment she bites into it. Truman Capote (Michael J. Burg), who
wrote the novella on which ``Breakfast of Tiffany's'' was based, is
visibly upset with Hepburn's performance, saying he would rather
see Marilyn Monroe star in the film because she knows how to eat.
</P>
<P>
   The film movingly deals with the Belgian-born Hepburn's
traumatic childhood during the Nazi occupation of Holland during
World War II (she worked as a courier for the Dutch resistance);
her rise to international film stardom; her torrid on-screen
romance with William Holden; her marriage to Mel Ferrer (a miscast
Eric McCormack of ``Will &AMP; Grace''); and her never-ending search
for the love of her father, a Nazi sympathizer who abandoned the
family.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge in making the film, says Robman, was
upholding Hepburn's much-earned legacy, not only as an actress but
as a humanitarian. ``This woman is a cherished figure,'' says
Robman, who directed Hewitt often on ``Party of Five.'' ``We wanted
to respect that. We weren't interested in finding a dark, terrible,
awful secret. And there are none. People needed to believe Jennifer
was filled with grace and dignity like Audrey.''
</P>
<P>
   They also needed to believe Hewitt, who lost 11 pounds for the
film, imitating Hepburn's distinctive, yet unidentifiable accent.
Her mother was Dutch. Her father English. Hepburn grew up in
Holland and England. To help Hewitt, ABC hired a dialect coach.
``It took her about a half-day to get it right,'' Robman marvels.
``She's a singer and has an unbelievable ear. She approached it
like memorizing a melody.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, Hewitt does nail the accent to near perfection. But
as she notes, it wasn't easy. ``It was the hardest thing to do,''
she says. ``A lot of times, the performance was right, but you
couldn't move on to another shot because part of the accent wasn't
there. Every day I was scared to death in that accent. There was
even talk of not doing the accent, but it wouldn't have been the
same movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt hopes she won't be viewed as the same actress after ``The
Audrey Hepburn Story'' airs. Instead of being cute and perky, she
wants to be serious ... and sexy. ``I've always been the cute
Gidget versus Marilyn Monroe,'' she says, sighing. ``There are
times I wish people would say, `Jennifer is sexy and so hot,' not
just perky and cute all the time. But I'm much more the Gidget type
and you just have to live with it and face it. But I would like to
prove there's more depth to me than just laughing and a smile.''

 &HT;    The human face of inhuman conflict
 &HT;    By Stephen Kiehl
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ From the front lines in France came a
birthday present for 2-year-old Dan Buschhoff _ a letter from his
Uncle Fred, who was clearing a path toward Germany with the 101st
Airborne Division.
</P>
<P>
   In swirling blue ink on thin brown paper, Fred Buschhoff made an
eloquent argument for waging a brutal war in the name of equality
and opportunity, and he made a lasting impression on his young
nephew.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means an even chance for every man to get a job, a home, a
meal, or to raise a family free from the fear of destitution,''
Fred Buschhoff wrote in the Jan. 5, 1945, letter. ``It applies to
big things and little things and is one more important reason that
we are fighting today. Protect it, cherish it, and nourish it
always for it's your birthright and your future.''
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks after writing those words, 19-year-old Fred
Buschhoff was dead _ shot during the Battle of the Bulge. Dan
Buschhoff kept the letter close to him as he moved from New York to
New Jersey and, in 1990, to Hobe Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Now it has a new home at Florida State University's Institute on
World War II and the Human Experience, a place where the letters,
photos and diaries of veterans and their families are being
preserved and indexed for the future use of historians, teachers
and students.
</P>
<P>
   Buschhoff's letter is just one of 2,000 donations in the
collection, which fills three cramped, windowless rooms in the FSU
history building. The boxes are stacked from floor to ceiling _ a
black-and-white record that tells the story of the war in the words
of those who lived it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to convince veterans that what they have is worth
saving,'' said William Oldson, the institute's director and an FSU
history professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This generation is so modest. One guy said, 'Why do you want
this? I'm just the anonymous American soldier who helped win the
war.' Well, that's it. That's what we want.''
</P>
<P>
   The project has taken on a new urgency as even the youngest
World War II veterans are now in their 70s. The Pentagon estimates
that about 1,500 die every day, leaving Oldson with a five- to
10-year window to gather as much as he can.
</P>
<P>
   For many veterans, parting with the most permanent reminders of
their service is a difficult, wrenching decision, Oldson said. But
it's made easier by their desire to educate tomorrow's children and
their fear that all their letters and photos and medals will end up
in a landfill.
</P>
<P>
   MORE THAN JUST LETTERS
</P>
<P>
   So veterans have emptied their closets to the institute, giving
more than just letters and pictures. There's a huge, gold-colored
9mm anti-aircraft shell carried off a battlefield in Europe, a
sprocket chain from a bomber that crashed, a pinup-girl playing
cards and V-discs with messages to the soldiers from Frank Sinatra
and Bing Crosby.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of uniforms and medals, tiny saws and colorful
silk maps of Europe that pilots kept in their shoes in case they
were shot down. Oldson says women come in, see the silk maps and
say, ``So that's where all my stockings went.''
</P>
<P>
   While the World War II veterans are now in their 70s and 80s,
their letters are reminders that they were once vigorous
18-year-olds trying to make sense of a terrifying world.
</P>
<P>
   On April 30, 1945, Milton Telfeyam wrote home to Westchester,
N.Y.: ``As long as any war lasts, there is always a tension in mind
and body. You sort of go to sleep with one eye open, and wake up
with the feeling that another day is here and you'll have to fight
your way through it. ... This war scares the hell out of me, as it
no doubt does to most everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The World War II institute started three years ago when
Tallahassee businessman George Langford was looking for a home for
all the letters he and his brothers and sister wrote to their
mother during their war. He wanted them to be saved, so he talked
to Oldson about donating them to FSU.
</P>
<P>
   All four Langford children joined the services, two in the Navy,
two in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all wrote to my dear, sweet momma, and she saved all those
letters,'' Langford said. His older brother, Bill, was killed by a
grenade on the beach at Luzon the night before he was to return
home. He had spent 30 months in the South Pacific without a
scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is important for the memory of my brother,'' said
Langford, 76. ``History is written from the generals' reports. They
don't tell you what our boys and girls were really doing.''
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the institute's mission is education. Oldson gives
his history students copies of the World War II letters to make the
war more personal for them, to put human faces on a conflict that
many students find as ancient as the Civil War. He is also
establishing links with Florida high schools so history teachers
can use materials on the institute's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Oldson wants the institute to be a resource for students and
researchers. So he has about a dozen graduate students cataloging
the letters and photos to create a searchable database on the Web.
People will be able to enter a relative's name, and then they'll
get pictures of that person and other related information.
</P>
<P>
   ``These students are not going to listen to me if I teach
straight military history,'' Oldson said. ``This makes it all a
little more real.''
</P>
<P>
   REVEALING THE HOLOCAUST
</P>
<P>
   During the war, much of the Western world knew very little of
the Holocaust. But as the Allied forces swept across Germany in the
spring of 1945, some soldiers wrote home with graphic details of
the horrors they uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   On April 12, 1945, Lt. Col. Ralph Willey wrote a letter headed
``Dear Friends'' and told of the 5,000 dead he found at a
concentration camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their bodies were lying in the buildings, stacked under the
staircases like wood and lying over the ground in a 40-acre
field,'' Willey wrote. ``The bodies were nothing but skin and
bones, with a large number of bones broken. The greater part of the
remaining 1,000 to 2,000 (people) were living skeletons with
hundreds of them expecting to be dead in a few days.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``Five dead men lying beside a dead horse and the
ribs of the horse gone and the bones laying beside them. They had
been trying to get something to eat. I saw a boy dead from
starvation and beating lying in the green field. ... I do think
that you back home should know and want to know firsthand that such
conditions did exist here. It is not propaganda, I assure you.''
</P>
<P>
   `NOT GOING TO SIT IN A BOX'
</P>
<P>
   Every letter and every photo holds some clue to how people lived
_ and died _ during the war, Oldson said. And he wants all of it.
He is frequently on the road, sharing his mission with veterans and
their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``One big selling point I've had with veterans is that this is
not going to sit in a box,'' he said. ``This will be put to some
use. And they just don't want what they did forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Buschhoff was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart. And
though he never made it back home for his nephew's birthday, as he
had hoped in his letter, his brother _ Dan Buschhoff's father _ did
survive the war and lived to celebrate many more birthdays with the
son who was born while he was in the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Buschhoff died in 1996. His wife, Marge, donated the letter
to the institute in September because she wanted people to remember
those who had been lost _ and why they were fighting at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept that letter in our fire box. We treasured it,'' said
Marge Buschhoff, who keeps the family's letters, photos and records

 &HT;    Toil in vineyard leaves no room for high-tech
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I am not married to a dot-com man, or even a low-tech
man.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to our North Georgia vineyard, where my husband
John gets to know his eight acres of wine-grape vines personally, I
am married to a no-tech man.
</P>
<P>
   Little did I know when I blithely volunteered to help with the
spring planting of another half acre that the vines themselves
hadn't yet arrived. I was set for the easy task of sticking the
gnarled bare roots in holes, covering them with a little soil and
dousing them with water, all to a reliable choir of birds on our
farm. But that wasn't what John had in mind when he hollered that I
should bring some heavy gloves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are the plants?'' I asked, holding my sloshing coffee
mug out the pickup truck window as we jostled over the creek and up
the hill to the new vineyard. It was laid out in perfect
12-foot-wide rows against a backdrop of majestic white pines, once
part of the Christmas trees John's dad planted. That was part of
the late W.T. Ezzard's winter work, when he wasn't busy plowing
corn and beans, pruning apple trees or cultivating blueberries.
</P>
<P>
   The vines haven't been shipped yet, John said with a sly grin,
the kind he normally saves for telling me he'd rather grab a quick
hot dog than go for pasta and a glass of wine at my favorite
restaurant. Suddenly, we heard the rattatat cry of a pileated
woodpecker. We could see him perched high on a pine tree, red head
bobbing in the morning sunlight. From John's standpoint, it was
perfect timing. I couldn't even feign a scowl as he handed me a
post-hole digger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't we use a gismo on the tractor for this last year,'' I
asked lamely. Not worth the trouble, John replied, except for
setting the posts. I winced, recalling my first and only previous
encounter with the diggers _ last summer, on hard red clay. Pulling
the wooden handles apart to make the metal shovels scoop up some
dirt was like taking on cement with ice tongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``About two-and-a-half feet deep,'' John yelled from the other
end of the row , pointing to a marker on the wooden handles.
</P>
<P>
   Prepared for a miserable challenge, I peeled off my jacket and
began to dig away. The earth was surprisingly soft and moist,
although a little rocky. A good workout for shoulders and arms, I
told myself, getting into a steady rhythm of forcing the diggers
down, pulling the handles apart and piling the dirt out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, we're not planting grapes in China,'' John teased when he
came to inspect my first hole. It was way too deep. I'd forgotten
to measure, concentrating instead on my perfect round hole. Half a
dozen holes later, with my shoulders aching and a jammed finger
throbbing, I saw three doe scamper out of the woods. They stopped
to graze in the pasture just below the vineyard. A yearling played
in the grass, showing its white tail. They grazed for a good half
hour, ignoring John and me but looking up periodically at a
neighbor's dogs. The pain in my shoulders suddenly didn't seem so
bad.
</P>
<P>
   We examined the vines in the old vineyard on our way back to the
house for lunch. The buds are just beginning to swell, and we feel
lucky they aren't further along. A late freeze after they pop out
is our chief worry every spring.
</P>
<P>
   John checked the special thermometers _ placed at strategic
spots in the vineyard _ that give us the high and low temperatures.
I suggested we look into software for my new computer to record the
temperatures, the rainfall, and the spraying regimen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-huh,'' John nodded with disinterest, pulling out his
tattered notebook to jot down the readings, as he does daily.
</P>
<P>
   I might as well give up, I told our daughter later. Maybe, she
suggested, we should capitalize on her father's computer
illiteracy. Advertise elite wine from hand-tended vines that
produce the perfect old-world grape _ on the Web, of course.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ I really don't wish to pile on Ricky Williams.
He's down. He had a miserable rookie season. He's been hurt. He's
been homesick for Austin.
</P>
<P>
   He's also a multi-millionaire. He plays a boys game for a
living. He's rung up more magazine covers in the last two years
than Bill Clinton, and without a write-up from Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it it was a bad year for the Heisman Trophy winner, and
last week has probably the worst. Williams had to apologize to New
Orleans and his team for comments in Sports Illustrated about the
town and the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, I wish not to pile on. But I read the same article
that has the Bayou steaming. And what bothered me about it was
something entirely different: Ricky leaves half-eaten food on his
floor.
</P>
<P>
   SI portrays Williams as a sort of Howard Hughes recluse in New
Orleans, with this key difference: Hughes took every pain to avoid
contaminating himself (needing a new tissue to touch so much as a
door knob). Williams' pad sounds just this side of a landfill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Couldn't see the floor for a month,'' said a training-camp
roomie of Williams' habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll eat like part of a banana and like throw it on the
floor,'' said his sister, disgusted with how he keeps a new and
spacious New Orleans home.
</P>
<P>
   Far be it from me to read too much into someone else's ditched
tea leaves. I hope this is nothing more than Ricky Williams',
freshman year, the rest-of-his-life-wise. Anyone who's been to
college remembers going, um, too long without using the dorm linen
service, or losing contact with the floor for all the loose
laundry.
</P>
<P>
   But throwing food on the floor? Pardon me, Ricky, but that's
obscene. It's not just the waste. It's not just the filth. It's the
statement.
</P>
<P>
   You bet, if I'm Ricky Williams and I'm reading this, I'm saying,
``Bug off. It's my life, my house.''
</P>
<P>
   Yours and the bugs'.
</P>
<P>
   HOLD THE PHONE, PEOPLE
</P>
<P>
   Really, this is not to comment on anyone's lifestyle, more to
comment on many lifestyles _ or those of too many people who have a
lot and take it for granted.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most grating commercials of all time has something to
do with wine. Granted, wine commercials are grating in and of
themselves. But this one pops my cork.
</P>
<P>
   In it, a group of leisure has its fashionable afternoon on the
pier interrupted by a cell phone. Once the group decides whose
phone has rung, the woman holding it decides not to answer. She
flings it in the pond with a fashionable laugh. And then so do the
others.
</P>
<P>
   La la la. That's five cell phones in the pond, cumulative
retail, oh, $600.
</P>
<P>
   We have people begging for food on street corners, people
appealing to relief agencies for assistance to pay their utilities,
and we've got models throwing cell phones into the pond and
millionaire athletes discarding food on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I could say this throw-away mind-set was confined to the
fashionable. A few years ago the PTA at our boys' elementary school
introduced a pencil machine to raise money. Some of the kids, most
from blue-collar homes or backgrounds even more humbling, were
thrilled to put a quarter into the machine. A few were so thrilled
that they would buy a pencil, and then deliberately break the
pencil, so they could put another quarter in the machine.
</P>
<P>
   Obscene.
</P>
<P>
   For one who's not very materialistic, I should not worry about
the fate of pencils, half-eaten bananas and soggy cell phones. The
Depression-era seed that created me, however, causes umbrage to
flare every time I see people frivolously treat things others
scrape and struggle to have.
</P>
<P>
   Stop your whining and pouting, Ricky. Life is very good. New
Orleans is a kickin' town. You're a blessed man. So am I. The next
banana I eat _ all of it _ is in your honor.

   Egypt 'R' Us. If seeing ``The Mummy'' just wasn't enough, check
out this quarterly publication, subtitled ``A Modern Journal of
Ancient Egypt.'' (KMT is the spelling of the name for Egypt in
ancient Egyptian.) The spring issue includes a story on the Museum
of Mummification in Luxor (Egyptian city, not Vegas casino).
Article notes that only the most independent traveler stumbles on
Luxor's best-kept secret, the first museum of its kind, dedicated
solely to the ancient art of preserving bodies (the Dick Clark wing
is a must-see). Turns out that mummification was not limited to
humans. The Egyptians also preserved animals, including crocodiles,
cats and apes. Also includes an interesting piece on the
restoration of six tombs in the Valley of the Kings, with color
photos of the brilliantly painted interiors, pillars and
sarcophagi. Of course, the exhibits are limited to items not swiped
by the British, who carted away Egypt's antiquities by the boatload
around the turn of the 20th century. Blimey! &QL;

   If you're all fired up to vote for George W. Bush this fall, you
might skip this month's issue, in which Molly Ivins knocks Dubya
off his pins with an adaption from her book, ``Shrub: The Short But
Happy Political Life of George W. Bush.'' With more clarity and
brevity than the recent tree-killer in ``Harper's,'' Ivins manages
to outline how Bush parlayed his family name into big money by
bouncing from loser company to loser company, always to be bailed
out in the end. ``In oil, as in politics, Dubya's MO is
consistent,'' Ivins writes. ``Leverage the family name and a small
investment into really big money, always provided by others.''
Ivins also notes that Bush flipped his oil companies, unloaded
stock as a corporate insider before the price plummeted and walked
away with ``more money than Bill Clinton ever dreamed of making on
a little real-estate deal now known as Whitewater.'' Still, she
says, Texas will forgive him as it did the likes of John Connally,
Lloyd Bentsen and Phil Gramm. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``VANITY FAIR'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is our favorite issue every year, the one full of those
cool photographs of Hollywood stars in Annie Leibovitz-type poses
(even though many of the photos are not taken by Leibovitz this
year). Best photo reunites the cast of ``American Graffiti.''
Amazing special effects allow George Lucas' ego to somehow fit in
the frame. Another favorite is Chuck Jones (OK, I'll admit it, I
thought he was dead), popping up out of a ``wabbit'' hole in the
desert. And then there is George Clooney, looking eerily like Clark
Gable (dead, we checked). Low point is Demi Moore naked with her
kids. Make the bad woman go away! The cranky guys over at ``Slate''
(www.slate.com) called this issue as ``hagiographic as ever,'' and
once we consulted a dictionary (www.dictionary.com) to figure out
what that means (worshipful biography) we have to agree. The
Slaters must be having one of those secret staff contests to get
obscure words into print. They also managed to work in the word
odalisque (harem girl), last used by Tennyson. &QL;

<P>
   Cover story is frightening piece on the future of the human race
written by Bill Joy, chief scientist at Sun Microsystems, inventor
of UNIX and Java and all-around genius-boy. Joy paints a picture of
homo sapiens dominated by a robot population of their own creation.
It sounds far-fetched until Joy makes his eloquent case, noting
that technology soon will be able to create extremely advanced,
self-replicating robots that could make old-fashioned biological
organisms obsolete. Quoting the Unabomber (ironic, because Joy was
once a prime target of the anti-technology terrorist), Joy warns of
unintended consequences that could spring from robotics, genetic
engineering and nanotechnology. ``By 2030,'' he writes, ``we are
likely to be able to build machines, in quantity, a million times
as powerful as the personal computer of today _ sufficient to
implement the dreams'' of those who imagine a world of robot
servants. If you want to know how this works out, rent the film
``The Forbin Project.'' &QL;

   It's also a good way to gauge public opinion. For example, with
Major League Baseball about to start, you might think that people

March Madness (NCAA basketball tournament); at No. 6, the WWF

at No. 16, NASCAR (vroom, vroom). Baseball was No. 40.
</P>
<P>
   As further evidence that the Internet is dominated by
14-year-old boys, a number of top sites involve popular Web pinups
such as Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez, Anna Kournikova, Jenny

 &HT;    Clinton Can't Budge Syrians, Israelis
 &HT;    By Bob Deans
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA President Clinton was unable to pull the leaders of
Israel and Syria back to the negotiating table, despite a day of
face-to-face and telephone diplomacy among the three men on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sent a special envoy to the region to try to press the
issue further, but White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told
reporters it was ``impossible to predict,'' when formal peace talks
might resume between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met here for three hours with Syrian President Hafez
Assad and spoke twice during the day over a secure telephone line
with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in Jerusalem. Also
participating was Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and her
Syrian counterpart, Farouk Sharaa, and a host of senior aides.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aim was to reinvigorate Israeli-Syrian peace talks
held under his auspices last January in the West Virginia hamlet of
Sheperdstown.
</P>
<P>
   Those talks collapsed after the two sides couldn't agree on a
formula for Israel's return to Syria of the strategic Golan Heights
in exchange for peace and normal diplomatic relations with its long
time Arab foe.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his diplomatic corps have been trying to narrow the
differences between the two sides for the past two months. The
president tacked his meeting with Assad onto the end of a week-long
swing through India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, hopeful that he could
get the Syrian and Israeli leaders to agree to a new round of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   During Sunday's conversations with both leaders, though, Clinton
became convinced that these longtime foes remained too far apart
for talks to be productive, said Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The differences are significant and important, and obviously
more work needs to be done in order to bridge them,'' said
Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to predict when these talks might resume,''
Lockhart told reporters traveling with the president. ``It is not
worthwhile to have meetings just to have meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also dispatched his special Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross,
who was part of Sunday's meetings here, to Jerusalem. Ross is
expected to give Barak a comprehensive briefing on Monday, and
Lockhart said Clinton remained hopeful that he would be able to
bring the two sides together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president committed to both sides to remain engaged and
working hard at this process,'' said Lockhart, ``and I think he
received in return from these two parties a commitment to do the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate outcome of Sunday's effort, though, appeared to
lengthen the odds against one of the highest foreign policy
priorities of Clinton's career securing an end to half a century of
war and enmity in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   While White House aides tried to downplay down expectations
going into the meeting, it was Clinton's first substantive meeting
with Assad in five and a half years. Clinton had hoped to use
personal diplomacy to get the two leaders to at least agree to
talk.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's talks wound up a flurry of weekend diplomacy for
Clinton, who met Saturday in Islamabad with the head of Pakistan's
military government, chief army general Pervez Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
   That meeting, too, was slow going for Clinton, who was unable to
secure assurances from Musharraf that he would rein in Islamic
militants in the disputed territory of Kashmir, return Pakistan to
civilian rule or roll back the impoverished country's nuclear
weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left Geneva immediately after the meeting with Assad. He
was expected to return to the White House early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   Brokering a comprehensive Middle East peace accord has been a
primary foreign policy aim of Clinton's since his earliest days in
office.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for such an outcome have been raised and dashed repeatedly
since September, 1993, when Clinton hosted a signing on the White
House lawn of the historic peace accord reached between Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   That accord set a five-year timetable for those two parties to
resolve all matters outstanding between them, including the
difficult so-called ``final status'' issues such as the future of
Jerusalem, the fate of thousands of Palestinian refugees and the
question of Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat missed a Feb. 13 deadline for establishing a
framework those talks. But the men are trying to complete that
phase with an eye toward resolving final status issues by autumn.
</P>
<P>
   The broad outlines of an Israeli-Syrian peace accord have long
been known. Any agreement would require Israel to return to Syria
the strategic Golan Heights, which Israeli troops captured in the
1967 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, Syria would agree to normalize its relations with
Israel, open its borders to Israeli transit and trade and embrace
the Jewish state as a regional partner.
</P>
<P>
   At issue, however, are questions about precisely where to draw
the border dividing Israeli territory from Syrian land. In an area
of particular contention, debate has raged over a patch of land 30
feet wide because it holds the key to fresh water supplies critical
in the desert region.
</P>
<P>
   Syria has demanded that Israeli troops pull back to the borders
in existence before the 1967 war. Barak has hinted that he would go
along with that, but Assad wants a commitment to that effect before
Syria will proceed with further talks.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, for its part, wants to be assured that it will receive a
genuine peace if it gives up the Golan. Israel also wants security
agreements to compensate for the loss of the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   The Golan Heights has provided Israel with a valuable listening
post, from which it can eavesdrop on the activities of military and
militant activity inside Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has conducted extensive talks with Pentagon officials
over how best to compensate for the loss of those assets.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has shown interest in acquiring a wide array of advanced
weaponry, attack helicopters, cruise missiles and other high-tech
gear. The deployment of an international peacekeeping and
monitoring force - perhaps including U.S. troops or advisers - is
also under review to enable Israel to maintain at least some of the
surveillance functions.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ With 86 shuffling steps, Pope John Paul on Sunday
approached the Western Wall, reached out a trembling hand to touch
its cool stone, and as is the custom of Jewish visitors, tucked
into a crevice a heartfelt note to God. Then he made a fluid sign
of the cross at the most sacred site in Judaism, and a hush
carpeted the plaza as the moment sank in.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's note bore the message of reconciliation that has been
the public theme of his six-day personal pilgrimage, which
concluded peacefully Sunday as he moved from the Al-Aqsa Mosque to
the wall and then to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. Traveling in
an armored jeeplike vehicle with heavy security, he linked with his
presence the nerve centers of the three Abrahamic faiths that
consider Jerusalem holy and reluctantly share the walled Old City
in its heart.
</P>
<P>
   But the interfaith link was a tenuous one. And it wavered even
before the pope flew off Sunday evening, visibly moved by his
journey along Jesus' footsteps, though the path traversed a Holy
Land mined with religious and political sensitivities. Having made
a mark on a place that does not impress easily, the pope left
behind the tensions _ and an open white sheet of paper that stood
out among the hundreds of folded slips wedged into the Western
Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``God of our fathers, you chose Abraham and his descendants to
bring your name to the nations,'' said the note, in English, which
was later moved to the Holocaust museum to be preserved. ``We are
deeply saddened by the behavior of those who in the course of
history have caused these children of yours to suffer. And asking
your forgiveness, we wish to commit ourselves to genuine
brotherhood with the people of the covenant. Jerusalem, 26.3.2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joann
</P>
<P>
   One after the other, Melchior, in Hebrew, and thenthe pope, in
Latin, read Psalm 122, an ode to peace in Jerusalem. Melchior said
the Jewish-Catholic reconciliation had been difficult for both
sides, ``which is why it took 52 years for this to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult for them theologically, and it's difficult for
us psychologically,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the ceremony progressed, most of the Jewish visitors to the
wall stopped praying and watched, hemmed in by security officers.
One young man, who shouted out in Hebrew, ``Jews, Jews, my family
was killed in Europe,'' was quickly hauled away by the police. The
police detained seven Jews and three Palestinians for disrupting or
planning disruptions of the visit, Israeli radio said.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's message created a document for Israel from a prayer
of forgiveness that the pope originally offered at St. Peter's
Basilica earlier this month. ``A 2,000-year-old account is now
closed!'' said Binyamin Ben- Eliezer, the communications minister.
</P>
<P>
   Like everything else here, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher is
riven. Three major Christian rites and several other denominations
share it. But the strife was quieted for the day as the sects
postponed their individual services to allow the pope to celebrate
Mass in what he called ``the mother of all churches.'' It stands on
what are venerated as the sites of Jesus' crucifixion, burial and
resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   Greeted by Syrian Orthodox clergymen wearing red Fez hats,
gold-embroidered tunics and ceremonial swords, John Paul was led to
the pink slab where tradition says that Jesus was prepared for
burial. Assisted, the pope sank to his knees and kissed it, lifting
from its marble surface a face lost in reverie.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he delayed his departure from the Holy Land so that he
could return to the Holy Sepulcher to pray once more before
leaving. ``The message of the Gospel takes on flesh and blood when
you come to these places,'' Maida said. The pope is ``a mystic and
very spiritual man _ the pilgrimage has brought this out like never
before.''

   ``Joannes Paulus II.''
</P>
<P>
   Hovering above the Old City, in the blue sky of a brilliant
Sunday, was a red, white, green and black Palestinian flag,
accompanied by scores of similarly colored balloons. The flag
disappeared and reappeared to flutter above the pope as his white
jeep bumped along the Via Dolorosa to the Church of the Holy
Sepulcher.
</P>
<P>
   From Jerusalem to Bethlehem to Nazareth and back, the pope, 79
and frail, has kept up a grueling schedule during the long-awaited
trip that many describe as an apex of his 21-year papacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is unsteady on his feet and he appears weak, but this has
probably been the strongest moment of his pontificate,'' Cardinal
Adam Maida of Detroit, a friend of the pope's, said Sunday as the
visit was drawing to a close.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis and Palestinians have been touched by the pope's
determination and balanced compassion as he progressed on his cane,
obviously with great physical difficulty, from place to place and
people to people.
</P>
<P>
   As they waited for the pope to board an El Al plane called
Jerusalem, Vatican officials declared the trip a success because
the pope acted and spoke from genuine, deep-seated convictions.
``The pope told everyone the truth without humiliating anyone,''
said Joaquin Navarro-Vals, the Vatican spokesman. ``He said what he
truly felt, and this was respected.''
</P>
<P>
   Vatican officials, who began the trip anxious about their
relationship with Israel, left feeling a stronger bond. They were
impressed by Prime Minister Ehud Barak, an official said _ by what
they considered the gracious and uplifting speech he gave at the
Holocaust memorial and by the way his government turned the other
cheek to Palestinian provocations.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Palestinians, whose cause they support,
somewhat disappointed them by failing to take advantage of the
worldwide platform they were afforded by the pope's visit. Vatican
officials were unnerved by the outbreak of violence among
Palestinians after the pope left a refugee camp on Wednesday and by
the strident political advocacy of Islamic clerics, one of whom
wagged his finger in the pope's face Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's itinerary, with its many sensitive stops, had the
potential to sabotage a successful trip in which the pope has
remained above the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem _ its sanctity, its sovereignty and its complexity _
moved front and center, and the pope's first stop was at the
Al-Aqsa mosque, the domain of the mufti, the city's chief Islamic
cleric.
</P>
<P>
   The pope inched out of the car onto a three-step riser covered
with worn carpeting. He followed other carpets, stamping down bumps
with his cane, into a small stone building beside the Dome of the
Rock. Before he entered, Muhammad Said Al Jamal, an elderly,
bearded imam, pressed a letter into the pope's hands and preached
to him, quite heatedly, about Palestinian rights.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the meeting, the pope did not know that the mufti,
Sheik Ikrima Sabri, had given several interviews over the weekend
filled with incendiary hostility toward Israel that minimized the
enormity of the Holocaust, said Navarro-Valls.
</P>
<P>
   The pope had hoped to have a conversation with the Muslim
leaders. Instead, the mufti read a speech in Arabic, which was then
translated into English by an assistant. Pointing out the window at
the gilded Dome, the mufti instructed the pope that Jerusalem is
``eternally bonded to Islam.'' He also cataloged grievances about
the Israelis, ending with a demand that the pope ``stand by justice
in order to end the Israeli occupation of Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope responded that he considered Jerusalem ``a part of the
common patrimony'' of Christianity, Islam and Judaism _ ``the holy
city par excellence.'' He did not verbally endorse Palestinian
claims to Jerusalem, but Palestinian officials later said that the
visit itself made it clear that Jerusalem is a divided city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope came to help us,'' said Faisal Husseini, the senior
Palestine Liberation Organization official in Jerusalem. ``We hope
that in Jerusalem, we can build two capitals in one open city.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to make the Palestinians' point about the occupation, the
Dome of the Rock compound was ringed by scores of blue-uniformed
Israeli soldiers, who clearly made the Muslims tense _ especially
those who were kept out.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the pope left, the tension erupted, when Muslim
youths poured into the esplanade. Some shouted at the police,
``Jews, the army of Muhammad will come back.'' Others started
throwing pebbles and water, some at Husseini, accusing him of
``giving the keys of Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa to the pope.'' After
much shoving, the scuffle broke up.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the pope had arrived at the wall, which Tzip
Zwick, 13, her braces shining in the sun, said was an affront to
the Jewish people. ``I feel that he has no right to be here,'' said
Miss Zwick, an Orthodox Jewish girl from Brooklyn, N.Y. ``This is a
special place for the Jews.'' She pointed to the women who faced
the wall with their noses pressed into prayer books and to the men
covered with fringed shawls who swayed and murmured.
</P>
<P>
   Official Israel disagreed. Rabbi Michael Melchior, an Israeli
Cabinet minister, walked the pope to the wall with a protective
hand ready to steady his gait. Earlier, the rabbi's voice had
boomed triumphantly across the plaza, calling for ``a new era in
which we commit ourselves to end the manipulation of the sanctity
of Jerusalem for political gain.'' But he also claimed Jerusalem as
the ``eternal capital'' of the Jews.

was killed in Europe,'' was quickly hauled away by the police. The
police detained seven Jews and three Palestinians for disrupting or
planning disruptions of the visit, Israeli radio said.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's message created a document for Israel from a prayer
of forgiveness that the pope originally offered at St. Peter's
Basilica earlier this month. ``A 2,000-year-old account is now
closed!'' said Binyamin Ben- Eliezer, the communications minister.
</P>
<P>
   Like everything else here, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher is
riven. Three major Christian rites and several other denominations
share it. But the strife was quieted for the day as the sects
postponed their individual services to allow the pope to celebrate
Mass in what he called ``the mother of all churches.'' It stands on
what are venerated as the sites of Jesus' crucifixion, burial and
resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   Greeted by Syrian Orthodox clergymen wearing red Fez hats,
gold-embroidered tunics and ceremonial swords, John Paul was led to
the pink slab where tradition says that Jesus was prepared for
burial. Assisted, the pope sank to his knees and kissed it, lifting
from its marble surface a face lost in reverie.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he delayed his departure from the Holy Land so that he
could return to the Holy Sepulcher to pray once more before
leaving. ``The message of the Gospel takes on flesh and blood when
you come to these places,'' Maida said. The pope is ``a mystic and
very spiritual man _ the pilgrimage has brought this out like never
before.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Showers and isolated thunderstorms will accompany a cold front
crossing the East on Monday. Rain will move east from the Ohio and
Tennessee valleys on Monday morning, reaching the Appalachians by
afternoon. Ahead of the front, breezes from the south will direct
mild air into the Northeast as morning sun yields to increasing
clouds. Onshore breezes will temper the warmth on the northeast
coast.
</P>
<P>
   Blustery winds from the northwest will import colder air into
the Middle West on Monday. As the sun heats the ground and
overlying atmosphere, vigorous currents of rising air will generate
clouds and spotty showers, some of which will produce small hail.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, a pair of disturbances will bring clouds and
scattered showers to portions of the Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Winds of March
</P>
<P>
   This past weekend, winds exceeded 30 mph in much of the
Northeast as a weak low-pressure system swept through the region.
Even in the absence of a big storm, the March atmosphere is primed
for strong winds. In early spring, winds several thousand feet
above the ground often blow at fast, winterlike speeds. Meanwhile,
a strengthening March sun warms the earth, generating updrafts and
downdrafts of air. These vertical motions mix the lower atmosphere,
directing fast winds aloft toward the earth's surface, setting the
stage for the gusty winds of March.

 &HT;    Putin Leads Russia's Presidential Vote
 &HT;    By Margaret Coker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW - As the ballot count continued into Monday, Vladimir
Putin, Russia's law and order candidate, appeared headed toward
victory after the second democratic presidential elections held
here since the fall of communism.
</P>
<P>
   With almost 40 percent of ballots counted by 1:00 am Monday
Moscow time, Putin had garnered 49.5 percent of the vote, well
ahead of his two main competitors in the 11-person race, according
to Russia's Central Election Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist Party candidate, was in second
place with 30.8 percent and Gregory Yavlinsky, the head of the
liberal Yabloko party, was in third with 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficial exit polls showed Putin winning 51.2 percent, which
if correct would mean an outright victory for the blond-haired,
47-year-old former KGB colonel. If no candidate receives more than
50 percent, a runoff between the two top candidates must be held.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials worked overnight to tally votes cast across
11 time zones. Complete results were not expected to be available
until midday Monday Moscow time. Officials did confirm that 68
percent of Russia's 108 million voters cast ballots, making the
vote valid.
</P>
<P>
   A smiling Putin, who became acting president after Former
President Boris Yeltsin resigned Dec. 31, appeared relaxed and
confident about victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until recently, taking part in elections seemed like a
nightmare to me. If there is no runoff I'll be a happy man,'' he
told reporters gathered at his campaign headquarters, where he
arrived after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the lackluster three-month campaign, polls showed
Putin with an unbeatable lead - a highly unexpected situation given
that only four months earlier he was an obscure bureaucrat working
as the head of the Russian secret service agency.
</P>
<P>
   But after Yeltsin picked Putin to be prime minister in August
and, to the amazement of most Russians, named him as his preferred
successor, Putin's ascension in the polls was lightning quick.
</P>
<P>
   He emerged in the eyes of many Russians a capable, decisive
leader thanks to the Chechen war. With campaign promises to restore
Russia's greatness, Putin soon became a symbol for people from all
walks of life who in the last nine years have watched their country
fall apart amid bouts of hyperinflation, massive financial crises
and rampant corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a leader who first and foremost can tackle corruption.
There is no better choice than Putin for this task,'' said
28-year-old Yuri Ponchiko, who showed up at the polls to vote for
the politician.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts say Putin's campaign strategy of talking only in
generalities helped his popularity. For instance, he announced he
supported continued market reforms for the country, but told voters
details about his economic program would only be published in May,
almost two months after the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Putin the electorate is choosing a stable, civilized
patriotism,'' analyst Alexander Tsipko said. ``What that means
exactly will be seen only later.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's election was originally billed as a triumph of
democracy in the former communist country, as it would mark the
first time that a Kremlin leader would cede power to a successor
chosen in a national vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin's surprising resignation on New Year's Eve gave a
slight twist to the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   His resignation pushed the presidential elections up by three
months, a period of time demanded by the constitution. The new time
frame put Putin's competitors at an extreme disadvantage, as they
had just concluded parliamentary elections on Dec. 19 and that had
taxed their parties' coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, on the other hand, was riding high, after a string of
victories in the Chechen war, and had little to worry about in
terms of exposure or financial expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   He took full use of his official position as head of state,
conducting numerous trips to the Russian hinterland and frontlines
in Chechnya, as well as meeting with international officials like
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright - all with TV crews from the state-run
television stations in tow.
</P>
<P>
   Television is crucial in such a huge country, and the Kremlin
controls both of Russia's biggest networks, RTR and ORT. Putin

   European parliamentarians who arrived in Russia to observe the
elections reported no widespread irregularities in voting Sunday.
However, they did express dismay about the lopsided media coverage
of the campaign.

   ``What we've seen are the same underhanded tactics observed in
other places. It's not a good sign for the growth of democracy,''
said Halle Degn, the president of the Parliamentary Assembly for

SOCK PUPPET TV STAR: INTERNET SYNERGY OR CONFLICT OF INTEREST? 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Feb. 23, the hosts of ``Good Morning America,''
Charles Gibson and Diane Sawyer, were particularly giddy about
their guest. The visitor was the comic sock puppet, which looks
like a mongrel dog, that has appeared on all the television
commercials of Pets.com, an Internet pets-supply company.
</P>
<P>
   On the air, the ``Pets.com sock puppet'' _ as he insisted on
being referred to _ was a charming clown. He called Gibson
``Chuck'' and sang ``Three Times a Lady'' to Sawyer. The glamorous
news personality responded flirtatiously by scratching the puppet's
ears and asking the puppet if it had a ``girlfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   At no time did the sock puppet hawk dog food or other products
offered by the Internet site he represents. But at no time did the
anchors mention a fact already known to them and Good Morning
America's executive producer, Shelley Ross: that Go.com, the
Internet arm of Walt Disney Co., ABC's parent company, had
purchased a stake of roughly 5 percent in the pet site only a month
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, ABC News and Pets.com all deny that Disney's stake in the
Web site played any part in Good Morning America's decision to air
the lengthy interview as well as a video clip of the sock puppet
earlier in the month. Ross said the idea to book the puppet was her
own and was based on the fact that the puppet was ``the hot buzz of
the moment.'' Ross added that she felt that Disney's stake in
Pets.com was ``insignificant'' and that she saw ``no conflict of
interest'' in using the sock puppet.
</P>
<P>
   But the incident shows the difficulties of news divisions in
policing potential conflicts of interest these days _ a time when
television networks, or their owners, are rushing to build
substantial portfolios of Internet companies by swapping equity in
such start-ups for advertising time. NBC Inc., a division of
General Electric, owns outright or has a stake in nearly 40
Internet properties. CBS Corp., which has agreed to be acquired by
Viacom, owns outright or has a stake in nearly two dozen Internet
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we move on, things are becoming more and more
complicated,'' said Eileen Murphy, the spokeswoman for ABC News.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the problem is the fact that while news staffers may
be aware of deals the news division makes _ for example, The New
York Times and ABC News are experimenting with jointly producing
feature segments for ``20/20'' and ``Good Morning America'' _ they
may not know of the deals made by other arms of the organization.
Even though Disney owns or has stakes in only four Internet
properties, its informing of its news staff of those deals has been
less than comprehensive.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 11, the Pets.com sock puppet appeared on ``Nightline.''
The ABC news program devoted the evening to the decision by Peanuts
cartoonist Charles Schultz to retire. The sock puppet was one of
many guests asked to pay tribute. Between commentary offered by
luminaries like the Harvard professor Alvin Poussaint and Jim
Davies, the creator of Garfield, the sock puppet offered bits of
wisdom like: ``Snoopy paved the way, you know, before Marmaduke,
before Clifford, there was the Snoopster, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had absolutely no idea'' that Pets.com was partly owned by
Disney, said Chris Bury, who was the correspondent for the report.
``Any suggestion that we were trying to advance the cause of
Pets.com is absolutely ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ken Bode, the dean of the Medill School of Journalism at
Northwestern University, argues that ignorance is not an excuse.
``When Disney's enterprises are as far reaching as they are today,
you have to be alert not even to use the news division even to give
the appearance of the cross promotion of corporate interests,'' he
said. ``ABC News ought to have someone watching for this.''
</P>
<P>
   After several interviews with The New York Times, Murphy said
that from now on, if the puppet appeared in another long feature
segment on ``Good Morning America,'' Disney's stake would be noted
for the viewers. But Murphy said that if the puppet or Pets.com
appeared in just a brief news item, its association with Disney
might not be acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said that ABC News would use a ``common-sense'' approach
in making disclosures in the future. NBC News said it would make
such decisions on a case-by-case basis. Only CBS said it had a set
policy for notifying viewers of the network's investments in
Internet companies. ``Wherever CBS News is aware of an affiliation
with a Web-based company, it is common practice to disclose that
affiliation to the viewer,'' said Dana McClintock, vice president
of communication for the network.
</P>
<P>
   Ross makes a persuasive enough case that corporate higher-ups at
Disney played no part in her attraction to the sock puppet. In
fact, the puppet, which has been hyped heavily in 13 different
television ads, including a Super Bowl spot, does seem to have
ballooned into a legitimate pop-cultural phenomenon before ABC put
it on its shows.
</P>
<P>
   Pets.com says it has received more than 10,000 e-mails from fans
of the ads, which generally feature the dog clowning with real
animals or singing goofy renditions of rock classics like
``Spinning Wheel'' and ``If You Leave Me Now.'' The puppet has also
been interviewed by non-Disney owned properties like Access
Hollywood and magazines like People, Time and Entertainment Weekly.
Of course, the popularity of the puppet gives ABC many other
openings for featuring it in ways that would not affect the news
division _ something the network has taken advantage of. In
addition to appearing twice on ``Good Morning America'' and on
``Nightline,'' the sock puppet has appeared on shows in ABC's
entertainment division, where disclosing affiliations is not an
issue. The puppet did a long interview on ``Live! Regis &AMP; Kathie
Lee,'' where it sang a duet of ``I Got You Babe'' with Gifford. And
last week he was the subject of a question on the immensely popular
game show ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   The question: What company has a sock puppet on its commercials?
</P>
<P>
   The contestant's final answer: Pets.com. He got that right.

WALL STREET USING WEBCASTS TO REACH INVESTORS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Interviews with analysts have been the stock in trade of
financial television broadcasts for years. Now the large brokerage
companies like Merrill Lynch, PaineWebber and others that have
provided the analysts are putting them directly before clients, via
their own Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Using streaming video technology, which is essentially
broadcasting over the Internet, the financial service companies are
experimenting with daily programs that resemble half-hour newscasts
but feature the companies' own analysts, reporting on market trends
and recommending hot stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street Webcasting stands to further blur the line between
financial service companies and the traditional media _ a process
that began years ago when some of the big brokerage firms started
sending television stations recorded interviews with analysts and
video news packages featuring the firms' big clients.
</P>
<P>
   The self-generated Webcasts also raise questions about
maintaining objectivity, when the primary purpose of the
information being given is to attract clients and sell services.
</P>
<P>
   The new Wall Street Webcasts are an example of how ``the walls
that have separated e-commerce from the media are coming down,''
said Mark A. Thalhimer, director of the Future of News project at
the Radio and Television News Directors Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening now is that the news provider, to a much
greater degree than before, has a financial stake in the
transaction that is being presented to the public,'' Thalhimer
said. ``I wonder how consumers will view that, and how they will
make the distinction between the news and someone so closely
associated with selling something.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the financial service companies see no conflict.
They consider what they are providing to be information that helps
both their large investor clients and the typical individual
investor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're providing is not just content, but context,'' said
Frank Zammataro, first vice president of the Digital Business
Development Group at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no question that the brokerage firms are
competing with Internet stock trading services like
E(ASTERISK)Trade for investors' attention. ``If you understand how
consumers are making decisions, then using the Internet this way
presents an opportunity to shape those decisions,'' Zammataro said.
</P>
<P>
   What Merrill Lynch provides is not really news, company
officials say, but information and opinion to help investors.
``What we feature can be newsworthy, but we are not a news
organization,'' said Fred Yager, director of Merrill Lynch Global
Broadcast Service.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch is far ahead of the other financial service
companies in Webcasting. Since last March the firm has put out two
daily menus, one on its general Internet site
(www.merrilllynch.com) for casual browsers and another just for
clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting calls from clients asking, `How come I've
always got to see your analysts on CNBC _ why can't you get them to
us first?''' Yager said.
</P>
<P>
   The Webcast on the company's general Internet site, which is
available starting at 11 a.m. each day the stock market is open,
includes streaming video reports about industry trends. Securities
regulations force Merrill Lynch to stop short of discussing
particular stocks, because the audience is too broad.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the reports, however, viewers are told that if
they want to know what Merrill analysts think about individual
stocks in the featured industry, they should follow a link to the
client site, askmerrill.com, which includes what is called the
Global Investor Network. Once there, they have access to the
complete Webcast. They can try a 30-day subscription, and get free
permanent access by opening an account.
</P>
<P>
   While the company has spent only an estimated $2 million on the
Global Investor Network, it can put out a half-hour report using
Merrill Lynch analysts on trading floors in New York, London, Hong
Kong and Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of this Webcast is the summary of Merrill Lynch's
morning call, the 7 a.m. meeting at which analysts discuss the most
widely held and active stocks of the day. There also are segments
on mutual funds, international investing and personal finances, all
with Merrill Lynch analysts who talk about stocks they recommend.
</P>
<P>
   With high-speed Internet connections, the Webcasts resemble
television broadcasts, and once put on the site they can be
downloaded by clients at any time. The connections tend to get
clogged, which affects the video quality. At slower speeds, the
images are hazy and movements are quite jerky.
</P>
<P>
   Yager, a former reporter and television producer, said that
since the project began last March, viewership had increased from a
few thousand per day to more than 100,000 daily hits.
</P>
<P>
   In a few weeks, the site will be overhauled. Yager said that
under the new format, clients would be able to switch from Webcast
reports on one company to archived reports on other companies in
the same field. They also will be able to download the text of
complete research reports done by Merrill Lynch analysts on related
stocks.

</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch has long been involved in television production.
Through its television network, it provides video interviews with
Merrill Lynch analysts to hundreds of local television stations
around the world that subscribe to the service.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the production is handled by Bob Plunkett, a former Fox
network television reporter who runs his own production company.
Plunkett said the main difference between preparing a news segment
for Merrill's Internet site and one for network television had to
do with packaging.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're putting something out on the Web, you're basically
giving it a lot more raw, straight objective data because we know
who the audience is,'' Plunkett said. ``If I was back at Fox, my
audience would have been so broad that I'd have to present the
material so that it could be understood by a big investment banker
and the guy who shines his shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Other financial service companies that do not have small clients
do not have to put on separate Webcasts the way Merrill Lynch does.
Goldman, Sachs, for example, plans to start a Webcast soon, but it
will be directed toward its institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   PaineWebber expects to begin a trial of a daily Webcast this
summer, according to Dennis M. McCann, the firm's director of
marketing communications. Clients will also be able to pay bills
and transfer funds while viewing the analysts' report.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest Wall Street firms, Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, took a tentative step into streaming video earlier this
month when it put on a widely publicized special Webcast about,
appropriately, Internet stocks. The firm says it will follow up
with other special Webcasts as warranted, but it is not ready to
put out a daily report that includes video on demand.
</P>
<P>
   Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. is already using streaming video to take the
place of the investor road shows it puts on in cities across the
United States to drum up support for new stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Peter D. Cherasia, head of e-commerce for Bear, Stearns, said he
was discussing a deal with CNBC to use the firm's Web site to
rebroadcast interviews done with its analysts after they appear on
television. Once the company generates enough content, he said, it
will revamp its Web site to include its own daily Webcast and other
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make our site as sticky as possible,'' Cherasia
said, using a term that refers to visitor retention, ``so clients
will have a reason to stay on or come back throughout the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as financial service companies seem intent on moving onto
the terrain of the traditional media, broadcasters and news
agencies are finding their way into financial services.
</P>
<P>
   In September, CNBC bought a 12.4 percent equity stake in
Archipelago, a large electronic communications network that has
applied to be registered as an Internet stock exchange. Other
investors in Archipelago include Goldman, Sachs and Instinet,
another electronic trading system that is part of Reuters Group,
the parent of one of the oldest news services in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The president of CNBC, William L. Bolster, said there was
currently no plan to take CNBC in that same direction. He noted
that General Electric, CNBC's parent company, already has a
financial arm _ GE Capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CNBC business model doesn't envision that,'' he said in a
telephone interview. ``I'm saying no, but I can't categorically say
that it will be no forever.''

HOLLYWOOD GREETS ONLINE ENTREPRENEURS AT DOT-COM FESTIVAL

   HOLLYWOOD _ Ground zero at the Yahoo Internet Life Online Film
Festival last week was the coffee shop at the ostentatiously retro
Standard Hotel on Sunset Strip. Black-clad, steely eyed hipsters
with cell phones circled one another like prizefighters, feigning
indifference. Others huddled in the diner's booths while fresh
deals were announced with almost every tick of the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a madhouse,'' said Mika Salmi, chairman of
Seattle-based Atomfilms, one of the Internet's leading exhibitors,
producers and distributors of digital movies. ``It's very fast here
in Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival is far from being the first or the only event
dedicated to the world of online film _ that is, the making and
distributing of digital movies on the Internet, an explosively
growing field some think is the vanguard of entertainment for the
future. But the two-day event that ended on Thursday night turned
into a kind of coming-out party, a faltering first date, for the
worlds of mainstream Hollywood and online entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50 companies that offer some form of online films took
part in the festival along with all the names that have become
familiar in recent months in the field. Besides Atomfilms there
were Ifilm, Shockwave, Pop.com, Filmbazaar, Sputnik 7, EVEO and
others. Also at the festival, though, were some representatives of
mainstream Hollywood, from Peter Guber, the former studio chief,
and his Mandalay Films, announcing a new Internet initiative, to
Propaganda Films, announcing a new partnership to produce movies
for Atomfilms.
</P>
<P>
   The impression was that a load of fresh chum had been tossed
into the water and there was a great roiling on the surface. But it
was difficult to tell exactly who was eating whom down below.
</P>
<P>
   ``All revolutions are great unless they kill you,'' Guber said.
``This is a potentially lethal time. But daring times require bold
actions. Blazing a trail to the future is hazardous duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most emblematic festival event came early, on
Wednesday morning, when 17 companies had five minutes each to stand
up before reporters and announce any new partnership or
acquisition. No time for questions, though. Too many deals to be
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Shockwave announced that the director David Lynch would join
Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of ``South Park,'' and the
filmmakers Tim Burton and James L. Brooks in creating films
exclusively for its site. Lynch said that his animated efforts
would be self-consciously dumb and poorly drawn, but he promised
they would be ``sophisticatedly crude.'' Pop.com announced that it
was joining with John Sloss, an entertainment lawyer and veteran
deal maker from the independent film world, to create Popfest, a
companion Web site that would compete with Atomfilms and others in
exhibiting the works of fledgling online filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Movie Database said it would join with Amazon.com
to create a special independent film area on its Web site that
would strategically link with Amazon's Advantage site to highlight
the works of independent filmmakers and even help them sell their
films. Universal Pictures, part of the Seagram Co., announced that
it would invest in Reelshort.com in hopes of ``providing an online
exhibition platform for cutting-edge creative work.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,800 people signed up for the online festival before
it was overwhelmed and registration had to be suspended on March
18. Along with seminars on how the worlds of Hollywood and dot-com
could get along, profitably, with one another, there were
screenings of online films, keynote speeches from Guber, the
journalist Kurt Andersen (who recently defected to the dot-com
world by founding Powerful Media) and the critic Roger Ebert, and
the world premiere of Mike Figgis' latest movie, ``Time Code,'' an
ambitious shot-on-digital comedy starring Stellan Skarsgard, Salma
Hayek and Jeanne Tripplehorn.
</P>
<P>
   A hostile scene outside the premiere of the Figgis film _ when
many times more people showed up than could be accommodated in the
theater, especially as three-quarters of its seats were reserved
for those affiliated with the film or the festival's sponsors _ was
defused when festival organizers added late-night screenings for
the overflow crowd. Hollywood luminaries Dustin Hoffman, Nicolas
Cage and Jodie Foster also showed up for the event.
</P>
<P>
   For two sunny days, the festival spread along the twisting
stretch of Sunset between the Standard Hotel and the Chateau
Marmont, about 200 yards apart, with the biggest events, like the
``Time Code'' premiere and the keynote speeches, held a few blocks
farther east in the auditorium of the Directors Guild of America.
The pool and the warren of walkways between the Marmont's bungalows
were festooned with balloons, plush chairs and banners advertising
the dot-coms that had their festival headquarters there.
Filmmakers, agents, production company scouts and dot-com aspirants
made the rounds there and in the hospitality suites at the
Standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This event has turned out to be kind of the key event of the
year for combining the Internet with the world of independent
film,'' said Diane Zoi, director of Amazon.com Advantage.

TWO NEW SYSTEMS TO HELP DEAF AND BLIND AT MOVIES

<P>
   The heads-up display, a staple of Hollywood science fiction and
films about jet-fighter jocks, has made the leap from the big
screen _ right into the darkened theater.
</P>
<P>
   A version of the futuristic displays _ translucent screens that
can carry text and images but can also be seen through _ is being
introduced as a way to let deaf filmgoers view subtitles that are
not visible to those in the audience able to hear the soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   The technology, along with a separate system that lets blind
people use headphones to hear a running description of the
on-screen action, has been developed by the National Center for
Accessible Media.
</P>
<P>
   The center, a joint effort of the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting and the Boston public television station WGBH, is
trying to adapt systems already used in TV broadcasting, in hopes
of enabling the deaf and the blind to attend movies in conventional
theaters alongside people who do not have hearing or vision
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The General Cinema theater chain, a partner in the tests,
recently installed the systems in one of the theaters at its Bay
Plaza multiplex in New York. The systems also are available at
General Cinema Clifton Commons in Clifton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   With the text-display system, called rear-window captioning,
subtitles are displayed, in mirror reverse, on a 7-foot-wide,
16-inch-tall light-emitting-diode screen at the rear of the
theater.
</P>
<P>
   People watch the film through a small smoked plexiglass panel,
which reflects the subtitles behind them while allowing them to
also see the movie screen at the front of the theater. The panel, 4
inches by 12 inches, is attached to a gooseneck extension that fits
into the cup holder on the armrest of the theater seat.
</P>
<P>
   The rear-window captioning system can be disorienting at first.
In fact, some advocates for the deaf and hard of hearing have
criticized the system, including Cheryl A. Heppner, executive
director of the Northern Virginia Resource Center for Deaf and Hard
of Hearing Persons.
</P>
<P>
   Heppner discussed the system in a message posted to the Media
Access Mailing List, an online discussion group. ``With only a few
exceptions,'' Heppner wrote, ``most of the people I have heard from
dislike rear-window captioning, and some cannot use it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   But when she was asked to elaborate in an e-mail interview,
Heppner said she supported the development of rear-window
captioning in the absence of a better solution.
</P>
<P>
   The descriptive video service, called DVS Theatrical, delivers a
spoken interpretation of the visual elements of a film to special
headsets.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Plaza theater is the 10th General Cinema house in the
United States to install the descriptive-video and captioning
systems, which are also available at a number of specialty theaters
around the country like Imax and Disney theaters.
</P>
<P>
   General Cinema's first installation of the systems was at a
multiplex in Los Angeles in 1997, for the openings of ``The
Jackal'' and ``Titanic.'' Brian Callaghan, a spokesman for General
Cinema, which is owned by GC Cos., said the chain was supporting
the technology because ``Our job is really bringing movies to the
public _ not just bringing movies to the sighted and the hearing
public, but bringing them to all the public.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The installation in New York, he said, cost about $12,000.
</P>
<P>
   Captioning and descriptive video have been available on
television and in home video releases for some time. The National
Center for Accessible Media has more than 200 captioned and
descriptive-video titles in its video library, and there is a
limited amount of described programming on PBS and on the Turner
Classic Movies cable channel. The descriptive narration is carried
on the SAP _ or second audio program _ on stereo televisions.

   Last month, citing the Americans With Disabilities Act, eight

<P>
   There's a paradox here somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Polaroid not only outsold its competitors in the
digital camera field, it even turned a slim profit on those sales.
Since analysts say that no one else is making money on digital
cameras, it was a coup.
</P>
<P>
   But talk to Polaroid executives and they shrug off digital
cameras as simply Polaroid's way of marking time. They expect that
a few years down the road, people will be snapping pictures with
cell phones, Palm Pilots and the like _ and, they hope, printing
them out on wireless Polaroid printers. ``The cameras are just
another way of capturing images, many of which we hope people will
want to print,'' said Gary T. DiCamillo, Polaroid's chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   The accuracy of this forecast could determine Polaroid's chances
for survival in a digital world.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid has always sold cameras pretty much at cost, and made
its money from chemical-and-paper film that develops itself in a
minute or two. Since digital photography is essentially an
electronic form of instant pictures, Polaroid is either in a unique
position to move into this field _ or uniquely suited to be
rendered obsolete by it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Polaroid executives stress the opportunities. ``I
laugh when people are surprised we're doing well in digital
cameras,'' said Brian D. Poggi, senior vice president for North
America. ``After all, they're really the same as instant cameras:
They provide an affordable and immediate picture.''
</P>
<P>
   But industry experts wonder whether the similarity will
translate to sales. Many note that, even as film sales shrink,
companies like Fuji and Kodak can still do a thriving business in
sales of coated papers, which can be used to make high-quality
prints of digital photos. But a Polaroid customer who switches to
digital photography is lost to the market for the company's
self-developing film _ unless those customers use Polaroid printers
or hybrid digital/instant cameras to make prints.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not clear to me what long-term digital strategy can
really replace what they are generating from film-based instant
prints,'' said Steve Hoffenberg, a digital photography market
analyst with Lyra Research Inc. in Newtonville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has similar concerns. Eastman Kodak and Polaroid
have both had earnings problems that have driven their stock prices
down in recent years. Kodak's stock remains mired in the $50s _
well below the nearly $70 it traded at a year ago. But many
analysts say the company has cleaned up its digital portfolio and
brought its costs under control, making its stock a good buy right
now. Few are as upbeat about Polaroid, even though that company's
stock closed at $25.1875 on Friday _ nowhere near the price of
$60.25 it reached in July 1997, but a nice rebound from its low of
$17.25 in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digital cameras, scanners, picture CDs, Web sites, they are
all geared toward one thing _ driving output,'' said Jonathan
Rosenzweig, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. ``And the
competitive picture for Polaroid in a digital world is a lot less
clear than it is for Kodak.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, as the only instant photography company in the
country, competition is not something Polaroid is used to. (Fuji
Photo Film Co. sells instant cameras and film overseas, but when
Kodak tried to do so here, the courts upheld Polaroid's patents.)
But as the digital revolution is wooing many people from the 35-mm
film camp, Polaroid could grab customers long loyal either to Fuji
or Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to be the only show in town for people who wanted
instant gratification on their pictures, and yes, we've lost
that,'' said Paul E. Lambert, Polaroid's senior vice president for
research and development. ``But for the first time, we can really
tap into the conventional photography market.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than try to capture a high-end digital market _ the
strategy that Fuji and Kodak have pursued _ Polaroid has farmed its
production out to overseas manufacturers, which make
Polaroid-branded cameras that sell for as little as $99 and rarely
top $300.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digital cameras are just their mechanism for building shelf
space,'' said Michael Ellmann, an analyst with Schroder &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   True to its mass-market roots, Polaroid already is spewing forth
products to fill those shelves. There is a portable scanner that
can upload images to the Web. There is a digital camera with a
built-in modem that can send pictures via the Web to Polaroid for
transfer to prints, T-shirts or other items.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Polaroid announced an alliance with PictureWorks
Technology, a software company, to develop more Internet-related
products. One on the drawing boards is a product to help
dermatologists keep a digital-image record of a patient's progress
during treatments for skin disorders and plug the pictures into
insurance claims forms.
</P>
<P>
   On the wireless front, Polaroid recently demonstrated a wireless
printer that can receive images transmitted by radio waves from up
to 50 feet away. ``This makes the process truly portable, because
digital cameras are no longer tethered to PCs,'' said Ulysses
Yannas, an analyst with Buckman, Buckman &AMP; Reid.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many of Polaroid's planned digital cameras will double
as makeshift printers. The company already sells a combination
instant-print and digital camera, aimed at teen-agers, that is
little more than two cameras glued together; the user cannot
instantly print an image captured digitally. Within a year, though,
Polaroid intends to introduce a hybrid camera that will collect
images electronically, but will also generate an instant print with
the press of a button.
</P>
<P>
   And the company's chemists are working on a new type of paper
for printing pictures that they claim will yield the same quality
as the silver halide films that Fuji, Kodak and Polaroid now use,
but at a much lower cost. By now, many inkjet printers can yield
high-resolution 8{-by-11-inch prints on photo-quality paper for
less than a dollar each. Although conventional Polaroid instant
film could be modified for use in a desktop printer, prints would
cost several dollars apiece.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Polaroid's attempts to reduce costs were hamstrung
by the need for a chemically treated paper that can both capture an
image and print it; now, digital cameras take care of that first
step. ``If we don't have to worry about capturing the image, we can
optimize how we print it out,'' Lambert said.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid is divulging few details about its research, and its
new paper is at least two years from market. Still, what has leaked
out excites analysts. ``They're talking a few cents per print,''
Yannas said, ``so they could capture a big share of the home print
market.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That market promises to be huge. Indeed, photo processors
already say that digital cameras have increased, not decimated,
their business. ``Digital photography has created a whole new
customer base for us,'' said Mitchell B. Goldstone, who owns 30
Minute Photo in Irvine, Calif. ``People use less film, but they
make more prints and enlargements.''
</P>
<P>
   But the conventional photography companies will not give up
market share without a fight. Kodak is also researching
non-silver-halide media for making prints. Last week, Kodak said it
would soon begin selling lower-priced digital cameras. And it
recently introduced a digital camera that can snap onto a Palm
Pilot and transfer images to the device's memory.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak also has a prototype digital camera that can e-mail images
via a mobile phone. ``The person receiving that e-mail image is
likely to print it out, or send it to Kodak via the Internet to get
prints,'' said Willy C. Shih, president of Kodak's digital imaging
business.
</P>
<P>
   Fuji, meanwhile, has been selling to photo processing labs a
printing method that uses lasers and heat, rather than a wet
process, to transfer images to paper. The company is now
introducing a similar, scaled-down, dry-process photographic
printer for home use. Unlike Polaroid and Kodak, Fuji is
manufacturing its own digital cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digital imaging is an industry unto itself, and we want to
provide a cradle-to-grave solution in that space,'' said Manny
Almeida, general manager of digital imaging at Fuji Photo Film USA.
</P>
<P>
   There are still opportunities that no photography company has
yet nailed down. B. Alexander Henderson, who covers the
photographic industry for Prudential Securities, contends that all
the photography companies should be touting their corporate Web
sites as places where customers can store their electronic
photographs, with an eye toward making prints in years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fuji, Kodak, Polaroid _ they could all generate repeat
business in prints, and enough traffic to generate advertising
revenue on their Web sites,'' he said. ``The holy grail of the
Internet is controlling content, yet none of them are doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, all of the companies do have breathing space to get
their digital acts together. Conventional photography is still
growing fast in emerging economies like China. And the Photo
Marketing Association says that amateur photography is a $15
billion annual market in the United States. Polaroid's own research
shows that 90 percent of American households own cameras, but only
6 percent own digital cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conventional cameras may get squeezed out within our
lifetime,'' Almeida of Fuji said. ``But in the next few years? No
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid, too, says that sales of its conventional instant
cameras and film are at an all-time high. Last year, the company
sold 9.7 million instant cameras, topping its 1978 record of 9.4
million. Its total sales hit $1.98 billion in 1999, up from $1.85
billion the prior year. And its net earnings were $9 million, a
nice improvement from 1998, when weak demand in emerging markets
combined with smaller orders from mass marketers in the United
States to cause a net loss of $51 million.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid has been concentrating its marketing efforts on the
youth market _ it just signed a sponsorship agreement with Britney
Spears, the popular singer _and its cameras have become hot sellers
among teen-agers. The company's I-Zone camera, a $25 item that
yields postage-stamp-sized pictures, was the best-selling camera in
the country last Christmas season. ``There's no question,
Polaroid's instant cameras are going gangbusters,'' said Hoffenberg
of Lyra Research.
</P>
<P>
   But the excitement is clearly in digital products. ``Instant
photography will represent the majority of our business in the next
five years,'' DiCamillo said, ``but digital will be the
fastest-growing area.''
</P>
<P>
   That will probably be true in Polaroid's troubled commercial
business as well. In contrast to its robust consumer sales,
Polaroid's commercial sales, which in the past represented half its
revenues, have been flat, and profit margins razor-thin.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid is banking that its mass market products will be used
for commercial ends. A hospital in Canada, for example, uses
Polaroid I-Zone cameras that yield sticky-backed prints to affix
pictures to admissions records. ``Half of our products are used in
business, even if they're bought at Wal-Mart,'' said Stephen
Golden, director of marketing for consumer electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Polaroid does have strictly commercial products as
well. Its digital microscopy camera, which captures what is seen
through a microscope, is selling well to research labs, despite
price tags that start at $6,000. Polaroid already is the world's
largest supplier of photo ID cards, and it has its sights on
becoming the dominant company for digitally produced
identification.
</P>
<P>
   It is ready to introduce a system, particularly intended for the
passport photo market, that would take and store photos digitally,
but print them out on Polaroid film. Polaroid already produces the
driver's licenses for 37 states, and it is testing a program in
West Virginia for snapping and storing digital photos of children
that police can use to help locate a missing child.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has new technologies for incorporating
fingerprints and facial recognition into ID cards. One system
enables states to check whether someone has a driver's license in
another name. And Polaroid just introduced a product, for sale to
computer keyboard manufacturers, that would let people use their
fingerprints in lieu of passwords and log-ons, by pressing their
index fingers against a little window.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid also is using the Internet to expand its base of
customers. It has begun accepting ID information and images via the
Web, mailing back ID cards within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``This now makes us accessible to small businesses that don't
want to spend thousands for an ID system,'' DiCamillo said. ``I
appreciate technology, but I'm a market-driven manager. And our
strategy, now and in the future, will be driven by understanding
what customers want.''

BIG SPRING SEEN FOR ART SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As news of the federal antitrust investigation of
Sotheby's and Christie's broke at the end of January, these auction
houses were right in the middle of trying to convince sellers that
it was the time to put their prized works of art in the houses' big
May sales in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did get calls from people asking how the investigation
would affect the market,'' said David Norman, head of Sotheby's
impressionist and modern art department in New York. ``And I'm sure
some people held back. But not many.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation centers on allegations of price fixing between
the two major auction houses and has resulted in the resignations
of both companies' chief executives and biggest business getters:
Diana D. Brooks of Sotheby's and Christopher Davidge of Christie's.
But their departures have not hurt consignments yet, although no
one is saying whether any of the best paintings this spring were
actually promised many months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the catalogs for the impressionist, modern and
contemporary art auctions are about to go to the printers, experts
say this spring's important sales are as strong as they have been
in years past. (Sotheby's and Christie's will each be offering well
over $100 million worth of paintings, drawings and sculptures in
their impressionist art sales alone.) All that is missing is a
large estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen the major estates that we saw in 1995, '96 and
'97,'' said Christopher Burge, Christie's honorary chairman in
North and South America and its principal auctioneer. ``But people
are realizing that the market is strong and that it hasn't
necessarily peaked. It's a good time to sell, especially for
longtime collectors who bought years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than having the usual tug of war between the two powerful
auction giants, this season has been marked by the appearance of a
new and rich presence that has aggressively invaded Sotheby's and
Christie's turf: Phillips, the sleepy, 206-year-old auction house
that was bought by LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton in October.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the deep pockets and competitive instincts of its
chairman, Bernard Arnault, officials at Phillips have been offering
sellers huge guarantees _ an undisclosed sum promised to a
consignor regardless of the sale's outcome _ in order to put
together an auction on a par with Sotheby's and Christie's. As a
result, for the first time in its history Phillips will have $80
million worth of impressionist and modern art to sell on May 11.
</P>
<P>
   But those who have been around the auction business remember
when a little-known Geneva-based auction house named Habsburg
Feldman opened a Manhattan office in a grand town house in the late
1980s and began holding auctions of fine art. While the market was
hot, so was Habsburg Feldman. But as soon as the economy hit the
skids in 1990, Habsburg Feldman fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   While experts say Arnault, with his endless sums of cash, will
not let that happen, the manner in which Phillips has been handing
out large sums to sellers is staggering. In some cases when
officials at Sotheby's and Christie's made offers to sellers, they
said they simply did not feel comfortable trying to match the
offers Phillips had made.
</P>
<P>
   Experts at both companies say Phillips is getting some material
they would have liked to sell, but neither was prepared to risk the
kind of money that Phillips has offered.
</P>
<P>
   Both dealers and auction-house experts are envisioning a number
of outcomes. One is that with the scarcity of great material on the
market, if things go well for Phillips, sellers will start
demanding unrealistically high estimates that could artificially
inflate the market.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that in today's market, buyers are savvy enough to
find out what things are worth and bid accordingly. And since in
some cases Phillips is paying far more than the true market value,
this could mean Phillips' sale will be a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Klein, the international executive director at Phillips,
declined to discuss either the estimates or the guarantees, saying
only, ``It will all become clear when the catalog comes out.'' (The
New York City Department of Consumer Affairs requires auction
catalogs to disclose any financial interest the house has in the
works it sells.)
</P>
<P>
   But Klein was happy to talk about some of the sale's top
paintings. There will be a group of works from Japan that include a
Cezanne landscape, ``The Surroundings of Gardanne'' (1886-1890). It
is expected to sell for $8 million to $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips' star attraction, however, is Malevich's ``Suprematist
Composition,'' an austere abstract composition that until recently
was hanging on the walls of the Museum of Modern Art. The artist's
31 heirs won a claim to get the painting back last year, and they
have given it to Phillips to sell.
</P>
<P>
   While the auction house says the painting dates from 1919,
curators at the museum say it was painted later, from 1923 to 1925.
The difference in dating is important, experts say. If it was made
in 1919, it is far more valuable. How much it is worth is anyone's
guess. Even Phillips refuses to say, but experts at other auction
houses believe the company has given the heirs a $15 million
guarantee.

</P>
<P>
   Officials at Sotheby's and Christie's maintain that they have
been conservative about the amount of financing they have offered
sellers this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's star painting _ and what is expected to be the
season's blockbuster _ Picasso's ``Still Life With Tulips,'' a 1932
portrait of the artist's mistress Marie-Therese Walter, does have a
guarantee, though no one will say how much. The painting, which
will be offered on May 9, comes from a European collector who
wishes to remain anonymous and who has owned it since 1957.
Christie's estimates that it will sell for between $25 million and
$30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Franck Giraud, head of Christie's 19th- and 20th-century art
department worldwide said that this season he had been able to put
together a stronger sale of impressionist and postimpressionist
art, but that 20th-century material has been harder to find. On May
8 Christie's impressionist and postimpressionist auction will
feature several big-ticket paintings.
</P>
<P>
   There is a spectacular Caillebotte, ``Man on the Balcony,
Boulevard Haussmann'' (1880), which depicts the back of a man who
experts think was the artist's lawyer, Albert Courtier. It carries
an estimate of $6 million to $8 million. The painting has been
included in several major Caillebotte exhibitions in the United
States and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   A Gauguin that had been hanging in the Dallas Museum of Art as
part of the Wendy and Emery Reves Collection, ``Farm at Le Pouldu''
from 1890, is also in the sale. Nicholas Maclean, head of
Christie's impressionist and postimpressionist art in New York,
said it has been suggested that the painting is part of a triptych,
with the other two in the National Gallery of Art in Washington. It
is expected to sell for $7 million to $9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's sale also includes an unusual 1894 portrait by Renoir
of the artist Berthe Morisot seated and painted in profile with her
daughter, Julie Manet, standing behind her. The painting is being
sold by descendants of Morisot and is estimated to sell for $9
million to $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also carrying a $9 million to $12 million estimate is one of
Monet's famous ``Waterlily'' series. This one, dated 1906, is a
particularly luscious image. A similar one sold at Christie's in
November for $22 million. Little wonder that Christie's has
estimated that this one could well sell for $20 million to $25
million.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's is also selling a Monet ``Waterlily,'' although it was
done two years later and is therefore less valuable. It, too,
explores the visual effects on the surface of the artist's famous
pond at Giverny. It is expected to bring $7 million to $9 million.
</P>
<P>
   But another well-known Monet image, that of Rouen Cathedral,
painted between 1892 and 1894, will be the top lot of Sotheby's
impressionist and modern art sale on May 10. Painted in the midday
sun, it is expected to bring between $15 million and $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's also has a 1932 Picasso but, rather than a portrait,
this is a still life, ``Guitar and Fruit Bowl,'' which has imagery
that suggests the body of Marie-Therese Walter. The painting
belonged to Douglas Cooper, the collector whose works were sold at
Christie's in 1992. Eight years ago the painting sold for $3.85
million. Now Sotheby's believes it will bring $10 million to $15
million.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more contemporary offerings this spring is a stunning
Rothko, ``Yellow Over Purple,'' from 1956, that is the star of
Sotheby's contemporary art sale on May 17. Its canvas, a wash of
yellows and oranges, is ``everything you could possibly want in a
Rothko,'' said Tobias Meyer, director of Sotheby's contemporary art
worldwide. It is expected to bring $7 million to $9 million.
</P>
<P>
   The sale is filled with blue-chip artists: Warhol and de
Kooning, David Hockney and Gerhard Richter, from a mix of
well-known European and American collectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buyers are hungry for great material,'' said Meyer. But he
added: ``In this strong economy no one is selling out of financial
need. This material is coming from people who know the market is
hot right now, and they're eager to take advantage of it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Reader, hear my confession. I'm writing an unchaste novel. It's
a little shocking, even to me. In my previous books I've mostly
written about sex by means of the space break. One reviewer claimed
I'd written the shortest sex scene in the English language. I know
the scene he meant; the action turns when one character notices a
cellophane crackle in the other's shirt pocket and declares that if
he has a condom in there, this is her lucky day. The scene then
proceeds, in its entirety:
</P>
<P>
   He did. It was. (Space break!)
</P>
<P>
   I think my readers rely on me for a certain reserve, judging
from the college course adoptions and the mothers who say they've
shared my books with their daughters. They may be in for a surprise
this time around. Not that the sex is gratuitous, I keep telling
myself. This novel is about life, in a biological sense: the rules
that connect, divide and govern living species, including their
tireless compunction to reproduce themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In this tale the birds do it, the mushrooms do it, and the
people do it, starting on Page 6 already. I'm having a good old
time writing about it, too. I've always felt I was getting away
with something marginally legal, inventing fantasies for a living.
But now it seems an outright scandal. I send my kids off to school
in the morning, scuttle to my office, close the door, and hoo boy,
les bons temps roulent!
</P>
<P>
   Now that I'm closing in on a finished draft, though, I've begun
to think about the people who will soon be sitting in their homes,
on airplanes and in subways with their hands on this book. Many
people. My mother, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   My writer-friend Nancy, a practical New Englander, offered this
counsel:
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara, you're in your 40s now, and you have two children.
She knows that you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, all right, she does. But what about the man from the ag
extension service, whom I've asked to vet my book's agricultural
setting for accuracy? How do I hand this manuscript to him? And
what about those English Lit teachers? I don't mind that they know
I know, or that I think about it, in circumstances outside my own
experience. Come on, who doesn't? Most people I know couldn't
construct a good plot to save their souls, but can and do, I
suspect, imagine detailed sexual scenarios complete with dialogue
(if they're female) and a sense of place.
</P>
<P>
   But they don't pass them around for others to read, for heaven's
sake. My dread is that people will take my book for something other
than literature and me for something other than a serious writer.
In anxious moments I've begun combing my bookshelves for fellow
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are plenty of authors before me who have put
explicitly sexual scenes into literature. There's a particularly
lovely one in the center of David Guterson's ``Snow Falling on
Cedars,'' there are sweetly funny ones in John Irving, and of
course we have John Updike, Philip Roth and Henry Miller. (Notice
the dearth of women on this list.) Even such distinguished
18th-century gents as Ben Franklin and Jonathan Swift scored the
occasional love scene in their prose.
</P>
<P>
   But I was surprised, on the humid afternoon I spent pulling down
books and looking for scenes that had burned themselves into my
memory, to see how often they were implied situations rather than
step-by-step enactments. Copious use of the space break, in other
words.
</P>
<P>
   The scene in ``Lady Chatterley's Lover'' I've remembered down
the years, it turns out, was mostly invented by me, not D.H.
Lawrence. (And given Lawrence's knowledge of love from the female
perspective, is that any wonder?) In actual word count, if the
literary novels in my bookcase accurately represent human
experience, it looks as if people spend roughly half their time in
intelligent dialogue about the meaning of their lives, and one
percent of it practicing or contemplating coition.
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me, but I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   Why should literary authors shy away from something so
important? Nobody else does. If we calibrated human experience on
the basis of television, magazine covers and billboards, we would
have to conclude that humans devote more time to copulation than to
sleeping, eating and accessorizing the hot new summer look,
combined. (Possibly even more than shooting one another with
firearms, though that's a tough call.) Filmmakers don't risk being
taken less seriously for including sexual content; in fact, they
may risk it if they don't.
</P>
<P>
   But serious literature seems to be looking the other way, ready
to take on anything else, with impunity. Myself, I've written about
every awful thing from the death of a child to the morality of
political assassination, and I've never felt fainthearted before.
What is it about describing acts of love that makes me go pale?
There is, of course, the claim that women who make a public show of
being acquainted with sexuality are expressing deviance, but that's
also said about women who make a show of knowing anything, and I
can't imagine being daunted by such nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   For decent folk of any gender, the official and legal position
of our culture is that sex takes place in private, and that's
surely part of the problem. Private things _ newfound love, family
disagreements and spiritual faith, to name a few _ can quickly
become banal or irritating when moved into the public arena. But
new love, family squabbles and spirituality are rich ground for
literature when they're handled with care. Writers don't avoid them
on grounds of privacy, but rather take it as duty to draw insights
from personal things and render them universal. Nothing could be
more secret, after all, than the inside of another person's mind,
and that is just where a novel takes us, usually from Page 1. No
subject is too private for good fiction if it can be made beautiful
and enlightening.
</P>
<P>
   That may be the rub right there. Making it beautiful is no small
trick. The language of coition has been stolen, or rather, I think,
it has been divvied up like chips in a poker game among
pornography, consumerism and the medical profession. None of these
players are concerned with aesthetics, so the linguistic chips have
become unpretty by association. ``Vagina'' is fatally paired with
``speculum.'' Any word you can name for the male sex organ or its,
um, movement seems to be the property of Larry Flynt. Even a
perfectly serviceable word like ``nut,'' when uttered by an adult,
causes paroxysms in sixth-grade boys.
</P>
<P>
   My word processing program's thesaurus has washed its hands of
the matter: it eschews any word remotely associated with making
love. ``Coitus,'' for example, claims to be NOT FOUND, and the
program coyly suggests as the nearest alternative ``coincide
with?'' It also pleads ignorant on ``penis'' and suggests ``pen
friend.'' A writer in work-avoidance mode could amuse herself all
day.
</P>
<P>
   I realize linguistic aesthetics may not be Microsoft's concern
here; more likely it's mothers. Roget's does much better,
reinforcing my conviction that the book is mightier (or at least
braver) than the computer. My St. Martin's Roget's Thesaurus
obligingly offers up 15 synonyms for coition _ though some are
dubious, like ``couplement'' _ and an impressive 28 descriptors for
genitalia, though again some of these are obscure. In a scene where
lingam meets yoni, I'm not even sure who I'm rooting for.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the language is ours for the taking. Fiction
writers have found elegant ways to describe life on other planets,
or in a rabbit warren, or an elephant tribe, inventing the language
they needed to navigate passages previously uncharted by our
tongue. We don't normally call off the game on account of
linguistic handicaps. When it comes to the couplement of yoni, I
think the real handicap is a cultural one.

   We live in a strange land where marketers can display teenage
models in the receptive lordotic posture (look it up) to sell jeans
or liquor, but the basics of human procreation can't be discussed
in a middle-school science class without sparking parental ire. The
same is true for evolution, incidentally, and I think the reason is
the same: our tradition is to deny, for all we're worth, that we're
in any way connected with the rest of life on earth. We don't come
from it, we're not part of it, we own it.
</P>
<P>
   It is deeply threatening to our ideology, at the corporate and
theological levels, to admit we're constrained by the laws of
biology. Sex is the ultimate animal necessity. We can't get rid of
it. The harder we try to deny it official status, the more it
asserts itself in banal, embarrassing ways. And so here we are,
modern Americans with our heads soaked in frank sexual imagery and
our feet planted in our Puritanical heritage, and any novelist with
something to say about procreation or the lordotic posture has to
negotiate that territory. Great sex is more rare in art than in
life because it's harder to do.
</P>
<P>
   To write about sex at all, we must first face down the polite
pretense that it doesn't really matter to us and acknowledge that
in the grand scheme of things, nothing could matter more. In the
quiet of our writing rooms we have to corral the beast and find a
way to tell of its terror and beauty. We must own up to its
gravity. We also must accept an uncomfortable intimacy with our
readers in the admission that, yes, we've both done this. We must
warn our mothers before the book comes out. We must accept the
economic reality that this one won't make the core English Lit
curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in spite of everything, I'm determined to write about the
biological exigencies of human life, and where can I start the
journey except through this mined harbor? It's a risk I'll have to
take.
</P>
<P>
   Reader, don't blush. I know you know.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress and the Federal Communications Commission,
two of this district's slowest bureaucracies, are moving with
remarkable alacrity in a fight over control of the airwaves and the
future of FM radio.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers and the regulators are quickly heading for a
collision over the government's plan to transform the nation's FM
radio band by giving away hundreds of new licenses for
noncommercial, low-power stations for schools, churches, community
groups and others.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, in response to thousands of requests to open such FM
stations, the FCC intends to begin the licensing process by
conducting a lottery to determine which states will be eligible
first. The licenses would enable so-called microradio broadcasters
to use inexpensive equipment and relatively small antennas for
100-watt stations that could beam programs over geographic areas as
large as seven miles in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   But Capitol Hill, responding to a wave of lobbying from the
nation's largest broadcasters, is moving swiftly to kill the plan.
Last Thursday, legislation blocking the plan sailed through a House
subcommittee, after the National Association of Broadcasters,
National Public Radio and many lawmakers raised concerns that the
signals from the new low-power stations would interfere with the
signals of existing stations.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which has 153 co-sponsors in the House and 21
in the Senate, is expected to be considered by the House Commerce
Committee soon. And because it has the endorsement of House Speaker
Dennis Hastert of Illinois, it could reach the floor shortly after
that.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has been bitter over the low-power radio program,
which has been in the works for more than a year and is among the
highest priorities of the FCC's chairman, William Kennard. The
controversy has involved unusual political alliances and dueling
technical studies about the effects of the new stations on existing
broadcasters. It has also made political enemies of some
traditional allies.
</P>
<P>
   National Public Radio, for instance, a bulwark of alternative
radio programming, has urged the FCC to delay the start of the
low-power program until July so that field tests can be conducted
to determine whether there will be significant signal interference.
Kevin Klose, the president of NPR, said the organization had not
endorsed the legislation, as proposed by the National Association
of Broadcasters, which would kill the FCC program.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, NPR now finds itself in the awkward position of
being opposed by some of the same religious, educational and
community organizations that were crucial allies in years past,
when NPR came under attack from Newt Gingrich and the Reagan
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition supporting the FCC's plan includes the United
Church of Christ; the U.S. Catholic Conference; the National League
of Cities; the Communications Workers of America; musical artists
like Bonnie Raitt and the Indigo Girls; and a number of colleges
and universities with NPR-affiliated stations.
</P>
<P>
   The community groups supporting the plan, in turn, find
themselves at odds with broadcast services for the blind _ whose
advocates fear that the new low-power stations would disrupt the
frequencies set aside for special programs on which volunteers read
newspapers, magazines and provide other essential information to
more than one million visually impaired listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, a divided FCC approved the plan after government
engineers scaled back the program and said their tests had found
that the low-power stations would not create any significant new
signal interference.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's decision prompted both legislative and
courtroom challenges from the industry. The National Association of
Broadcasters filed a lawsuit in U.S. Appeals Court here to overturn
the FCC's vote, while NPR asked the FCC to reconsider its decision.
</P>
<P>
   Under assault from such quarters and confident that its
technical analysis was superior to that of the industry's, the
agency decided to meet the industry's challenges by moving quickly
to implement the program. The lottery on Monday will determine
which states will be considered first to receive the new stations.
</P>
<P>
   The low-power program comes as the radio broadcasting industry
itself is at a crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard has tried to increase the number of voices on the
airwaves in response to the rapid consolidation of the commercial
broadcasting industry. According to a report this month by the
Congressional Research Service, the number of radio station owners
decreased by nearly one-fifth between 1995 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But that consolidation has had little discernable impact on the
volume of traffic across the spectrum, which has only grown more
congested in recent years as a result of new wireless technology,
and which broadcasters say would be overwhelmed by the introduction
of hundreds of new low-power stations.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to accusations that the agency has been reckless with
its management of the radio spectrum, Kennard and his aides say
that the broadcast industry has waged a scare-and-smear campaign.
They accuse the industry of using fraudulent technical arguments
about signal interference from the new low-power stations out of
fear that the new stations will lure listeners away from existing
broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the National Association of Broadcasters has
blanketed Capitol Hill with compact disks that purport to
demonstrate the kinds of interference that would be caused by
Kennard's plan. The disk simulates such interference as a cacophony
of radio programs colliding on one frequency. Although government
engineers say the simulation is downright fraudulent and cannot be
replicated at the FCC's radio lab, the compact disk has had a
substantial impact on the debate in Congress and has repeatedly
been cited by lawmakers as evidence of the need to block the
low-power radio program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The broadcasters have engaged in a systematic campaign of
misinformation and scare tactics to shut off new voices from coming
onto the airwaves,'' Kennard said in an interview last week. ``This
is not rocket science. We have studied the way FM signals propagate
around the country. The interference argument is being used as a
smoke screen to mask a historic battle by incumbents who want to
protect their markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be this undercurrent that low-power licensees _
community groups, schools, churches _ are somehow riffraff and
that's just not fair,'' he said. ``My plea to people is they should
allow this to go forward, and once they see that it will not create
havoc they will calm down.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the FCC had carefully crafted the rules, after
study by its engineers, to preclude any significant new radio
interference. The rules require, for instance, that there be at
least two frequency intervals on the radio dial between a low-power
station and any other station.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has replied that the rules are insufficient to
protect the spectrum and that the FCC, in its zeal to score
political points by helping the small community groups, have
abandoned its responsibility to protect the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The FCC has turned its back on its principle mission of
maintaining spectrum integrity,'' said Edward O. Fritts, president
of the National Association of Broadcasters. ``The technical
arguments are not a smoke screen. They stand on their own merit. If
this could be done, it would have been 20 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Fritts said that the compact disks given to congressmen and
senators were not misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clearly identified as a simulation of interference
effects, not a demonstration of actual interference,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While the legislation opposing the plan has been sponsored and
supported largely by Republicans, a growing number of Democrats
have begun to endorse it. Kennard, however, continues to enjoy
support for his proposal from other more powerful quarters of the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official said on Friday that presidential aides
were supportive of the proposal and did not see any need for
legislation to limit the FCC's ability to oversee the spectrum.
During the presidential campaign, Vice President Al Gore spoke out
in favor of Kennard's plan and said he thought it was a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush has not addressed the issue or taken a
position on it, according to Mindy Tucker, the press secretary to
Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But whether support from the White House will be sufficient
remains to be seen. In recent days, the National Association of
Broadcasters has mounted a vigorous campaign, getting broadcasters
in every state to urge their congressional representatives to kill
the plan. Fritts said he had not discussed the matter with his old
college roommate _ Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of
Mississippi. But apparently, Fritts sees no such need.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't spoken with him about this subject,'' Fritts said.
``I'm sure he'll be talking to the Mississippi broadcasters.''

IBM AND QWEST IN PARTNERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move to expand its ability to manage Web sites and software
applications for corporate customers, IBM intends to announce
Monday that it has struck a multibillion-dollar deal with Qwest
Communications International Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The pact calls for IBM to build and help operate Internet data
centers for Qwest across North America, executives from the two
companies said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fastest-growing segments of the electronic economy is
the so-called hosting business, in which information technology
companies manage computer systems that run Web sites or internal
software programs for corporate customers. The idea is that by
allowing an outside concern to act as host for those computers,
rather than managing them internally, companies can focus on their
core business while receiving expert technical support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers are starting to get serious about using the
Internet, about the use of e-commerce, and about building the core
processes that businesses run around what can be done on the
Internet,'' Douglas T. Elix, senior vice president of the IBM unit
involved in the effort, said in an interview Friday. ``This
alliance expands our ability to meet those needs.''
</P>
<P>
   As basic communications lines become largely a commodity market,
communications carriers of all sizes and descriptions are
attempting to expand into more sophisticated markets that can carry
richer profit margins, like Web hosting. In recent years, Qwest,
the upstart long-distance carrier, has announced alliances with
companies including KPMG, the consulting firm, and Oracle, the
database company, as it tried to expand its hosting business.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Qwest has enlisted IBM as perhaps its most significant
partner. IBM is already a leader in Web hosting and
computer-applications hosting, generating about $1 billion in
annual revenue from those businesses. But managing complex computer
systems _ IBM's forte _ often also requires managing complex
communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping up with demand in this market is always a challenge,
especially in finding qualified people,'' Lewis O. Wilks, Qwest's
president for Internet services, said Friday. ``Teaming with IBM is
a huge leap for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, IBM has agreed to build 28 North American data
centers, each having at least 100,000 square feet of space, for
Qwest over the next three years. The first four are to be located
in Dallas, Philadelphia, Sterling, Va., and near San Jose, Calif.
Over the next seven years, Qwest intends to pay IBM $2.5 billion in
construction costs and management fees.
</P>
<P>
   IBM intends to lease about 25 percent of the space in the sites
that it builds for Qwest. And over the seven-year life of their
contract, IBM intends to pay Qwest $2.5 billion for that space and
for the use of Qwest's fiber-optic communications network.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies will generally continue to market their
hosting services separately, but Elix and Wilks said that IBM and
Qwest could potentially collaborate and act as subcontractors for
each other on certain projects.
</P>
<P>
   The two executives declined to estimate how much revenue the
deal would help their companies generate from outside customers.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, IBM has appeared to ignore many other big
communications carriers while announcing a series of strategic
agreements with AT&AMP;T, whose chairman, C. Michael Armstrong, is a
former IBM executive. By reaching a major deal with Qwest, one of
AT&AMP;T's big competitors, IBM may be trying to demonstrate that it is
serious about forming partnerships across the telecommunications
industry.

`THE AUDREY HEPBURN STORY': A BIG-SCREEN LEGEND, ONLY SMALLER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(ms) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   We see her first in front of Tiffany's, where a bright yellow
Checker cab deposits her. She has on big black sunglasses and that
sleek black evening dress; her hair is swept up in a huge early-60s
French twist; she carries her coffee and pastry in a white paper
bag. And a man who looks like Truman Capote is sitting a few feet
away in a director's chair, grumbling about how much better Marilyn
Monroe would have been in the role.
</P>
<P>
   The first scene of ABC's movie ``The Audrey Hepburn Story''
takes us to the New York filming of ``Breakfast at Tiffany's''
(1961), in which Hepburn played the sort-of call girl Holly
Golightly from Capote's novella. It evokes Hepburn's star power and
tests the mettle of Jennifer Love Hewitt, the 21-year-old
television actress who has dared to play a sacred screen star whom
many movie fans consider inimitable.
</P>
<P>
   But Hewitt, as she probably knows by now, can relax. Her
portrayal of Hepburn, who died in 1993, is not the disaster many
people expected. In fact, with the help of a voice coach (getting
Hepburn's voice right makes up for a lot) and an intelligent script
by the playwright Marsha Norman, Hewitt, the star of her own Fox
series, ``Time of Your Life,'' does an admirable, obviously
respectful impersonation.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that ``The Audrey Hepburn Story'' rises above
its genre. All three hours of the film argue against the
advisability of making biographical films like this at all. When
the subject is a contemporary _ someone viewers vividly remember
and can still see, in her radiant originality, in dozens of films _
even Meryl Streep might have trouble capturing the magic.
</P>
<P>
   The film's flashback narrative begins in Brussels in 1935, with
the 6-year-old Audrey hiding under the dining room table eating
sugar buns. Her parents argue, and after little Audrey (Sarah
Hyland) dances once with her father (Keir Dullea) in the park, he
leaves for a new job in London and is scarcely seen again.
</P>
<P>
   Next we see the lonely adolescent Audrey (Emmy Rossum), whose
father has not telephoned in five years, being shipped off to
boarding school in England, where it is hoped she will make
friends. At Rigden's School in Kent, Audrey discovers ballet,
which, as her roommate explains, ``makes you forget how sad you
are.'' But once she has happily settled in, her mother (Frances
Fisher, in a reprise of her ``Titanic'' role as an aristocrat
holding her head high through hard times) insists on moving to the
Netherlands, which looks like a safer bet than England as World War
II expands.
</P>
<P>
   Bad idea. Arnhem, where Audrey and her mother stay with an
uncle, is soon invaded by the Germans. The uncle, working for the
Resistance, is killed. Audrey, who helps the Resistance by
delivering messages on her bicycle, sees people she knows shot dead
by German soldiers or taken away by them. There are terrible food
shortages, and when Audrey becomes ill (anemia, asthma and colitis)
the town is out of medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
   After the war Hepburn (now played by Hewitt) continues her
ballet studies in London, but her teacher levels with her. ``I
regret to tell you,'' she says, ``that you have neither the stature
nor the talent to achieve success as a prima ballerina.'' A dance
classmate (and future star), Kay Kendall (Seana Kofoed), suggests
dancing in musical theater, and Jerome Robbins casts them both in
``High Button Shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hepburn, this leads to bit parts in movies, mostly playing
cigarette girls. Meanwhile she meets the perfect man, James Hanson
(Peter Giles), who is handsome, kind, fabulously rich and supports
her career wholeheartedly. But when Colette (Lenie Scoffie) spots
her near a movie set in Monte Carlo and immediately knows that she
should play her heroine Gigi onstage, Hepburn breaks off her
engagement and heads for Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   From there it's one career success after another. After ``Gigi''
comes her first film, ``Roman Holiday,'' and a best-actress Oscar;
the play ``Ondine''; the film ``Sabrina,'' during which she has an
affair with William Holden; and ``The Nun's Story,'' during which
she first becomes concerned with the plight of hungry children
around the world. This inspires her work later in life with Unicef.
</P>
<P>
   She marries Mel Ferrer, and they have a son. She finds her
father again and learns that he has not changed. The film ends with
``Breakfast at Tiffany's'' and summarizes the rest of Hepburn's
life _ a second marriage, to Dr. Andrea Dotti; a second son; her
final years with Robert Wolder in Switzerland, where she died of
colon cancer at 63 _ in a few sentences.
</P>
<P>
   In this version of Hepburn's rise to fame, directed by Steven
Robman, virtually everyone who meets her is instantly charmed. In
some cases, normally sophisticated people seem a little too easily
impressed. It is possible that Colette, upon seeing Hepburn for the
first time, said, ``Look at her, she's charming,'' but surely not
in such an astonished voice. And Capote (Michael J. Burg) may have
really been surprised that Hepburn understood the symbolism of
tossing the nameless cat out of the taxi in ``Breakfast at
Tiffany's,'' but he probably didn't stare at her dumbfounded as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   In the end the lesson of Hepburn's life seems to be that
privilege followed by privation and a mother who imparts lessons
like ``Women of our class do not whine or sulk'' are great
character builders. Not even Hollywood could take that away.

   &UR; LEARNING HOW TO CRACK A JOKE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In ``Survival Skills for the Modern Man,'' Men's Journal tells
how to make your friends slap their knees. According to
 &UR; Rodney Rothman &LR; , who writes for the ``Late Show With  &UR; David &LR; 
 &UR; Letterman &LR; ,'' ``Everyone knows about the rule of threes. You know,
people tend to find things funny in groups of three. What people
don't know is the rule of 17s. Four through 16 is not funny.
Seventeen is funny again.''
</P>
<P>
   The old saw about the letter ``K'' being funny is passe, says
Rothman. ``In my opinion, that's no longer true. Today, H is funny.
And A if there's an umlaut over it.'' (Sharp-eyed readers will note
that today is Umlaut Day in Personals, and where else can you find
a diacritical jamboree?)
</P>
<P>
   One more thing: ``If a joke doesn't fly, say, `Then I got hit in
the face by a goose.' Or `Then I got hit in the face by
 &UR; Charles Durning &LR; 's pendulous breasts.' Now it's funny.''

   &UR; GAMESMANSHIP &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Responding to last week's item about the Six Degrees of
 &UR; Kevin Bacon &LR;  game,  &UR; Phil Lapsley &LR;  notes that mathematicians bestow
Erdos Numbers. If a scholar has co-written a paper with the
``incredibly prolific'' Hungarian mathematician  &UR; Paul Erdos &LR;  (note
to editors; there should be an umlaut over the o in Erdos), the
scholar has a rating of 1. If a paper has been co-written with
someone who has written with Erdos, the rating is 2.
</P>
<P>
   Lapsley points to the Erdos Numbers Project, as described in a
Web site maintained by  &UR; Jerry Grossman  &LR; of Oakland University.
Erdos is actually linked to Bacon in four steps, starting with the
mathematician's appearance in the 1993 movie ``N Is a Number.''

interview with Led Zeppelin's  &UR; Jimmy Page &LR; , in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   After Page ignored Uhelszki's questions, the critic realized
that she was supposed to direct each question to Page's publicist,
who would then pose it to Page.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think of the new album?'' Uhelszki asked the
publicist.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wants to know what you think of the new album,'' the
publicist asked Page.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have strangled him,'' said Uhelszki to the panel's
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' said myplay.com editorial director  &UR; Ben &LR;

Jimmy Page.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Putin Leads Russia's Presidential Vote
 &HT;    By Margaret Coker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW - As the ballot count continued into Monday, Vladimir
Putin, Russia's law and order candidate, was headed toward victory
after the second democratic presidential elections held here since
the fall of communism.
</P>
<P>
   With almost 60 percent of ballots counted by 3:00 am Monday
Moscow time, Putin had garnered 50.7 percent of the vote, well
ahead of his two main competitors in the 11-person race, according
to Russia's Central Election Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist Party candidate, was in second
place with 30.5 percent and Gregory Yavlinsky, the head of the
liberal Yabloko party, was in third with 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficial exit polls showed Putin winning 51.2 percent, which
if correct would mean an outright victory for the blond-haired,
47-year-old former KGB colonel. If no candidate receives more than
50 percent, a runoff between the two top candidates must be held.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials worked overnight to tally votes cast across
11 time zones. Complete results were not expected to be available
until midday Monday Moscow time. Officials did confirm that 68.5
percent of Russia's 108 million voters cast ballots, making the
vote valid.
</P>
<P>
   A smiling Putin, who became acting president after Former
President Boris Yeltsin resigned Dec. 31, appeared relaxed and
confident about victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until recently, taking part in elections seemed like a
nightmare to me. If there is no runoff I'll be a happy man,'' he
told reporters gathered at his campaign headquarters, where he
arrived after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the lackluster three-month campaign, polls showed
Putin with an unbeatable lead - a highly unexpected situation given
that only four months earlier he was an obscure bureaucrat working
as the head of the Russian secret service agency.
</P>
<P>
   But after Yeltsin picked Putin to be prime minister in August
and, to the amazement of most Russians, named him as his preferred
successor, Putin's ascension in the polls was lightning quick.
</P>
<P>
   He emerged in the eyes of many Russians as a capable, decisive
leader thanks to the Chechen war. With campaign promises to restore
Russia's greatness, Putin soon became a symbol for people from all
walks of life who in the last nine years have watched their country
fall apart amid bouts of hyperinflation, massive financial crises
and rampant corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a leader who first and foremost can tackle corruption.
There is no better choice than Putin for this task,'' said
28-year-old Yuri Ponchiko, who showed up at the polls to vote for
the politician.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts say Putin's campaign strategy of talking only in
generalities helped his popularity. For instance, he announced he
supported continued market reforms for the country, but told voters
details about his economic program would only be published in May,
almost two months after the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Putin the electorate is choosing a stable, civilized
patriotism,'' analyst Alexander Tsipko said. ``What that means
exactly will be seen only later.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's election was originally billed as a triumph of
democracy in the former communist country, as it would mark the
first time that a Kremlin leader would cede power to a successor
chosen in a national vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin's surprising resignation on New Year's Eve gave a
slight twist to the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   His resignation pushed the presidential elections up by three
months, a period of time demanded by the constitution. The new time
frame put Putin's competitors at an extreme disadvantage, as they
had just concluded parliamentary elections on Dec. 19 and that had
taxed their parties' coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, on the other hand, was riding high, after a string of
victories in the Chechen war, and had little to worry about in
terms of exposure or financial expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   He took full use of his official position as head of state,
conducting numerous trips to the Russian hinterland and frontlines
in Chechnya, as well as meeting with international officials like
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright - all with TV crews from the state-run
television stations in tow.
</P>
<P>
   Television is crucial in such a huge country, and the Kremlin
controls both of Russia's biggest networks, RTR and ORT. Putin
benefited from flattering news coverage, while his opponents were
portrayed in a negative light if at all.
</P>
<P>
   European parliamentarians who arrived in Russia to observe the
elections reported no widespread irregularities in voting Sunday.
However, they did express dismay about the lopsided media coverage
of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've seen are the same underhanded tactics observed in
other places. It's not a good sign for the growth of democracy,''
said Halle Degn, the president of the Parliamentary Assembly for
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, or OSCE.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential inauguration is set for May 5 should the ballot
be settled in a single round and between May 25-28 if it goes to a
runoff.

MARTHA ARGERICH: ELECTRICITY ONSTAGE, THEN A TUMULT OFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Carnegie Hall may not have offered anything quite
like this since Vladimir Horowitz returned to the recital stage in
1965 after a dozen years of retirement. Here, on Saturday evening,
was the electrifying Argentine pianist Martha Argerich in her first
major solo appearance in 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade Argerich, now 58, has been treated,
apparently successfully, for melanoma, or skin cancer, which spread
to her lymph nodes and lungs. The recital on Saturday, which
included appearances by the Juilliard String Quartet and Nelson
Freire, a Brazilian pianist and old friend of Argerich, was to
benefit the John Wayne Cancer Institute in Santa Monica, Calif.,
where the treatments took place.
</P>
<P>
   Even during that troubled decade Argerich continued to perform
concertos, most recently on March 14 at Carnegie Hall with Charles
Dutoit and the Philadelphia Orchestra. But she was far from a
constant presence on the musical scene even before then, scheduling
sparsely and canceling performances often, sometimes at the last
moment and seemingly on a whim.
</P>
<P>
   So it was undoubtedly with some trepidation that the ticketless
approached scalpers on Saturday, and with considerable relief that
a full house greeted Argerich's actual appearance onstage. The
applause, complete with foot-stamping, was tumultuous, and a
nightful of standing ovations began early, a Bach partita and two
Chopin numbers into the program.
</P>
<P>
   What this listener remembered best from a previous Argerich
recital at Carnegie was, again, a Bach partita. Then, especially as
the very propriety of Bach on the piano was being questioned by the
new early-music orthodoxy, Argerich's performance seemed willful,
wildly individualistic and incomparably exciting.
</P>
<P>
   Now the performance of early music, and of Bach specifically,
has won freedom in many directions, yet Argerich's performance of
the C minor Partita (No. 2) here seemed no less distinctively her
own. Her interpretation, freely modulating between hair-raising
virtuosity and gorgeously plush soft playing, seemed to recognize
Bach as the first musical high romantic if not modern. Or more
simply, the first great musical individualist.
</P>
<P>
   Chopin's Barcarolle and C sharp minor Scherzo alternated
similarly, between blazing bravura and the ultimate in finesse (the
ultimate, at least, that can be made to register in a hall the size
of Carnegie), shifting colors at every moment.
</P>
<P>
   As in the Bach it was possible to recall or imagine a different,
perhaps ``better,'' way of stating virtually every phrase: those
cascades from high above in the scherzo, for example, as mere
delicate trickles. Yet all such considerations fell aside as so
many irrelevancies in the wake of the indomitable thrust of
Argerich's pianism.
</P>
<P>
   And then came a work seemingly tailored to her fearless,
eruptive style, Prokofiev's B flat Sonata (No. 7), in which she
savored the haunted moments as well as the clangorous ones. Again,
with any deliberation at all she could have made more of the manic
ostinato figure that sets the finale in motion, but her blistering
romp through that movement carried a logic of its own, or would
have if one had had time to think, or even breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the attention of so many listeners trained on her every
gesture, Argerich professes to feel lonely in solo performance. So
the second half of the evening became a party of sorts. In
Schumann's burly Piano Quintet, the Juilliard String Quartet was
energized: more so, probably, than ever before in its present
conformation (with Joel Smirnoff and Ronald Copes, violinists;
Samuel Rhodes, violist; and Joel Krosnick, cellist), now a few
years old.
</P>
<P>
   At that, these veterans of many a chamber-music battle seemed at
times to be hanging on by their fingernails, laboring to keep up
with the tireless Argerich's pace and to match the intensity of her
sound. This performance, not always pretty but everywhere highly
charged, made the work sound like a fifth Schumann symphony, the
way an old recording by Sviatoslav Richter and the Borodin Quartet
made the Piano Quintet by Brahms sound like his Fifth Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   In ``La Valse,'' by Ravel, and two encores, Argerich was joined
by Freire, a longtime collaborator. In this partnership, too,
Argerich sets the tone, and the unity is one of spirit rather than
letter, with a perfect unison sometimes sacrificed to a spirited
turn of phrase or burst of energy.
</P>
<P>
   The encores were another Valse, from Rachmaninoff's Suite No. 2
for Two Pianos, and ``Laideronnette, Imperatrice des Pagodes'' from
Ravel's ``Ma Mere l'Oye'' for one piano, four hands: some eight
minutes of music. For the rest of a half-hour after the concert the
audience supplied the noise, as lusty as it was long. Only after
the house lights had been raised and the stage lights dimmed
several times over did listeners disperse _ many, no doubt, to
raise a glass to Argerich's continued good health.

RED SKY AND NUFORIA PLAN TO MERGE HOT, INTERNET-DRIVEN ENTITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the nation's hot creative boutiques specializing in
Internet marketing and advertising plans to merge with a larger
interactive shop, reflecting a trend of marriages between
Internet-driven firms and agencies that produce creative material
for the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The companies plan to announce the merger Monday, according to
executives for both agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sky Interactive, the San Francisco-based shop known for its
work on the Web for clients like Nike, Absolut vodka and Altoids
mints, will merge with Nuforia Inc., a larger shop based in New
York and Houston that was formed through a merger just nine months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The newly combined company will have 315 employees in seven
offices. The two merging companies had combined revenues of about
$30 million in 1999, roughly $7 million of which came from Red Sky.
The new firm will be called Red Sky Interactive, with its top
executives located in various offices around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The merger came out of Red Sky's need for both critical mass and
greater technical ability, which the company said would be needed
with the advent of broadband, or high-speed, Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sky and other interactive shops contend that broadband
capacity will have profound effects on advertising. It will combine
broadcast and interactive technology to give consumers extensive
choices for programming and information, said Tim Smith, Red Sky's
40-year-old founder and chief executive officer, who will become
the new firm's chief strategic officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The projects we are going to do are going to get enormous, and
we knew we weren't going to make it as a boutique,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage was blessed by Omnicom Group Inc., the world's
largest advertising agency organization, known for huge global
agencies like BBDO Worldwide and TBWA Worldwide. Omnicom has
minority stakes in both Nuforia and Red Sky, as well as 19 other
interactive and digital firms, largely through a unit called
Communicade. In fact, according to Smith, the two firms were
introduced to each other by Omnicom's president and chief
executive, John D. Wren. Smith said that Wren was a personal friend
who sat on Red Sky's board.
</P>
<P>
   ``He introduced us and left the room,'' said Smith. ``It wasn't
a shotgun wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   In Nuforia, Smith said Red Sky found the technical structure,
engineering base and personal chemistry that it had been seeking in
a partner for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is part of a big trend among interactive agencies. In
the last year, interactive shops involved in mergers include
Agency.com, Razorfish and USWeb/CKS, now called MarchFirst after
its acquisition in December by Whittman-Hart. Meanwhile, several
big shops have started their own interactive agencies, like BBDO's
(at)tmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Nuforia itself is the result of a merger last June between Belk
Mignogna Associates, a New York Web-design and brand-creation firm,
and Net Explorer Inc., an e-business company with a staff of some
100 developers and engineers. BMA merged for similar reasons as Red
Sky, said BMA's founder, Howard Belk, who becomes president of the
new Red Sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a branding and interactive shop that was front-end
focused,'' Belk said. ``We had a thin rank of developers and
engineers, and we were frustrated by partnering with companies.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are more mergers to come, predicted Bill Bingham, 48,
formerly chief executive officer of Nuforia and now chief executive
of the new Red Sky. He said agencies needed to merge the technical
and creative sides to offer ``end-to-end'' services for clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be more,'' predicted Marissa Gluck, analyst with
Jupiter Communications in New York, the Internet research and
consulting company. ``Merging tech and creative is a no-brainer.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the activity is simple: the market for
interactive services is booming, from Web site design to
promotional CD-ROMS to direct interactive advertising on the Web,
like banner ads. Online ad spending alone is expected to grow to
$4.7 billion this year, from $3.2 billion last year, according to
Jupiter Communications. Firms in the business have seen their
revenue double, triple and quadruple since their meager starts just
a few short years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually every company in this area is turning work away,''
said Ted Kempf, a senior analyst with the GartnerGroup's Dataquest
research unit, in Mountain View, Calif. ``The companies that merge
what we call the back end with front-end new media capabilities are
well positioned to help traditional brick-and-mortar business enter
the e-connected age, the new business era.''
</P>
<P>
   Gluck said the mergers also had allowed some firms to reach
sufficient size to go public, including Razorfish, Organic and
Agency.com, which are all Communicade agencies. Red Sky said that
it, too, would consider a public stock offering, but that no plans
for one were currently under way.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Omnicom has high hopes for the new Red Sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is that both companies combined have all the
potential to become the next market leader,'' said Bruce Redditt,
an Omnicom Group executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The current market leader is Sapient, in Cambridge, Mass., with
1999 revenues of $277 million, according to AdweekOnline, published
by the trade magazine Adweek.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sky will continue to seek mergers and acquisitions over the
next 24 to 48 months and has plans to expand internationally as
well, Bingham said.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1993, Red Sky has done work that included a Web site
for Altoids mints; among its features is the Peppermint Lounge,
where users can download and mix their own funky music. Another is
millerlite.com, a site that allows users to create a beer pager
that alerts friends when it is ``Miller time.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Sky and others predict that broadband technology will create
a revolution in the ad business. Stephen O. Frankfurt, a longtime
ad executive and senior vice president at Nuforia and the new Red
Sky, said he expected broadband to remake advertising the way TV
remade the ad world in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sky calls the new advertising ``strategic entertainment,''
which essentially means merging product news or advertising with
entertainment. Red Sky has been using entertainment, like the beer
pager, to pull people into the site, but Smith said that was just
the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, because of broadband, the television screen may
offer broadcast programming that is also interactive. Rather than
watch a program and then go to a Web site for more information, a
consumer might be able to click on a link right on the screen, with
no interruption of the entertainment programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enormous challenge here is realizing the nature of
advertising is fundamentally about to evolve,'' Smith said. ``And
we are right on the cusp of it.''

CISCO TAKES INTERNET PHONES TO NEXT STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a year ago that John T. Chambers, chief executive of
Cisco Systems, said he wanted the traditional telephone on his desk
to be gone in 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   That has not happened; the old phone is still there. But Monday,
Cisco intends to announce an office telephone system based on
Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   The system, which transmits voice calls in the electronic
language of the Internet, could push the company to the top of the
budding Internet-telephone market. Proponents say such systems
bring new convenience, efficiency and cost-savings to corporate
communications.
</P>
<P>
   While North America's traditional office telephone powerhouses,
Lucent Technologies and Nortel Networks of Canada, are also
developing Internet phone systems for offices, Cisco may have the
early edge.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch intends to make Cisco's the main phone system at a
new campus in Hopewell, N.J., with 5,000 of the new phones to be
installed over 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Texas Instruments is experimenting with about 500
of the new phones in an international test. Executives from both
companies are giving the new Cisco system positive reviews.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the ways in which technology has changed how people
live and how companies do business, the final frontier of the first
Internet revolution will probably be the humble telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Many communications companies are promoting so-called Internet
telephony as a low-cost long-distance alternative for consumers.
But the sound quality of phone calls over the public Internet is
generally inferior to that of calls over traditional telephone
systems. The technologies and systems are not yet in place to allow
the Internet to reliably transmit high-quality phone calls for
millions of people.
</P>
<P>
   Office networks, however, are in some ways much more stable than
the public Internet, perhaps making them more amenable to early
Internet telephone efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Most offices now have two communications networks, one for
computers and another for telephones. Many companies maintain
separate staffs for each. Cisco's vision is to allow companies to
use a common Internet-based network for both computers and
telephones internally, reducing cost and complexity and adding new
functions to the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The networks that can't do data, voice and video are
dinosaurs,'' Chambers said in an interview last Friday. ``We're
going to see open standards for any new telecommunications or
computer product to connect to one network. This is the first
gauntlet thrown down in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's new Internet phones connect to an office's Ethernet data
network using a jack like those on the back of a standard office
computer. One of the most attractive features of the system is that
the phone can identify itself to a corporate network regardless of
its location. A worker from New York, for instance, could take his
or her phone to a corporate office in San Francisco and be reached
as easily as in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can plug the phone into any connection, and it will keep
the same number you had,'' Brian J. Bonner, chief information
officer and a vice president at Texas Instruments, said. ``You can
take your phone and plug it in at a TI office in Germany, for
instance, and I can dial your number, which looks like Dallas, and
it rings in Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   When a worker changes offices at a company that uses a
traditional phone system, a technician must generally reconfigure
the phone system so that the worker's old phone operates correctly
at the new location. An Internet phone system can eliminate that
effort and cost, leading some of Cisco's customers to believe that
the Internet system would be much cheaper to operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some very compelling economics associated with IP
phones relative to traditional phones,'' said John A. McKinley,
chief technology officer and an executive vice president at Merrill
Lynch, referring to Internet protocol, the language of cyberspace.
``Ultimately, I think this represents the next stage in growth for
Cisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambers must think so, too. The traditional phone by his desk
shares space with one of his company's new creations.

A MEDIA MACHINE GETS TOO CLOSE TO HOME  
 ON THE OUTS AT FOX AND CONDE NAST  
 SHORT LIFE FOR SHORT'S SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The e-mail message that hundreds of journalists received from
the P.R. Newswire started out routinely enough. Executives of the
distribution service and Web site for public relations offices
wrote that it sought ``to strengthen the link between companies
posting press releases to the site and journalists like yourself
who will use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many readers might well have hit the delete key right then. But
some who did not were dismayed at what came next: ``Beginning in
early April, public relations professionals will be able to know
which journalists opened their releases on the Press Room site.
Reports will be available that will say who, what media
organization and when a particular news release was read.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It did strike me as creepy,'' said Michael Armstrong, an
assistant business editor at The Philadelphia Inquirer. ``I
objected primarily to their characterization that this would
actually benefit journalists. The only benefit I saw was to p.r.
firms.''
</P>
<P>
   P.R. Newswire, which is owned by United News and Media Group of
London, says that some 1,700 reporters use its Web site. As the
e-mail message arrived, a small but fervent band of outraged
journalists protested. By week's end, P.R. Newswire was in need of
some good p.r.
</P>
<P>
   Renu Aldrich, its spokeswoman, stepped into the breach. ``The
reason this evolved is that we are getting into the measuring and
monitoring business,'' Aldrich said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``We just purchased eWatch, an Internet monitoring
service. Measuring and monitoring are key for public relations and
investor relations professionals. They need to know where they are
being mentioned, what people are saying about them, so they can
track crises, rumors, things being said on message boards'' and
elsewhere in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   But in response to the protests, she said, no report will
include a journalist's name or news organization unless they have
explicitly allowed themselves to be tracked.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for the names of some of the 25 or so reporters who had
complained, Aldrich said: ``I wouldn't feel comfortable telling you
without their permission.''
</P>
<P>
   _ FELICITY BARRINGER
</P>
<P>
   Two media execs leave
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, vulgarity and cutting edge were on the ascendant. Some
mainstream media companies felt, well, out of step.
</P>
<P>
   So two of them, Fox Entertainment and Conde Nast Publications,
plucked media executives from the edge and brought them in to liven
things up.
</P>
<P>
   Fox hired Doug Herzog, the former Comedy Central executive
responsible for the scatological humor of ``South Park.''
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, S.I. Newhouse Jr., chairman of Conde Nast and
its parent, Advance Publications, recruited Mark Golin, editor of
Maxim magazine, to resuscitate Details magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Events last week showed how fickle the corporate world can be.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Herzog resigned after a little more than a year as
president of Fox Entertainment, a unit of News Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since his first prime-time lineup in September had no hit
shows, there had been reports that he would be replaced. Then last
fall, Fox sent him a veiled vote of no confidence: They hired
another executive, Sandy Grushow, to help run his division.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Mark Golin, the editor in chief of Details, was
dismissed after an eight-month tenure, during which he tried to
resuscitate the Conde Nast men's magazine by featuring on the cover
a succession of nearly nude actresses.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that Golin did not mesh with the more rarefied
tastes of the Conde Nast culture. That would have been fine if the
newsstand numbers had turned around, but they never did. Details
lost the race to Maxim, the publication Golin built, which surged
past all other men's titles in circulation last year.
</P>
<P>
   Steven T. Florio, the president of Conde Nast, told the Details
staff that the May issue would be the final one under Conde Nast's
ownership; after that, the magazine will be remade by Fairchild
Publications, a corporate cousin of Conde Nast.
</P>
<P>
   The day he was dismissed last week, Golin said, ``Well, I sure
could have used more time.''
</P>
<P>
   At least, the Fox Network still exists. Details turned out to
have had as much staying power as a deposed Soviet apparatchik
airbrushed from a Stalin-era government portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members cleaned out their offices on Friday. All
references to Details magazine in media material relating to a
party that the magazine was to have co-sponsored in Los Angeles
last Friday night were quickly expunged, replaced with Conde Nast
Publications.
</P>
<P>
   And in ``Contact,'' a play by John Weidman that will reopen at
Lincoln Center Theater on Thursday night, a character makes a
reference to the ``What's Hot, What's Not list in Details
magazine,'' a line that elicits a knowing laugh from the audience.
Last Friday, Philip Rinaldi, a spokesman for the play, said that
Weidman would change the reference to another magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to stay hip and contemporary,'' Rinaldi said.
</P>
<P>
   _ ALEX KUCZYNSKI
</P>
<P>
   Martin Short Show Not Quite Canceled
</P>
<P>
   The producers of ``The Martin Short Show,'' an ambitious,
syndicated, nighttime-style talk show that made its debut in
September, will tape what is expected to be its final episode this
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The producers are not happy.
</P>
<P>
   King World Productions, the show's owner, will not formally
pronounce the show dead.
</P>
<P>
   But is it alive? Bernie Brillstein, one of its executive
producers, said on Friday: ``I am telling you as a betting man, on
my five children, my wife, my home and my business, that it's not.
The staff is dispersing as of next Friday. We're just going to
finish out its season and it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Short's Los Angeles-based show garnered considerable attention
when it was first broadcast last fall, in part because it was
devised with a nighttime sensibility, even though it was to be
shown in the morning or afternoon in many parts of the country.
Aside from interviews, it also featured sketch comedy, character
portrayals by Short _ a ``Saturday Night Live'' alumnus _ and it
generally won favorable reviews. In his first episode, Short played
Martina Navratilova as a secret agent in a failed television pilot
called ``La Femme Martina'' and, in a spoof of news magazine shows
called ``Prime Time Edition Tonight,'' impersonated Janeane
Garofalo campaigning to save a serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Brillstein said, its late-night appeal may very well
have been its undoing. The show is watched in about a million homes
nationwide, compared with more than 11 million for ``Wheel of
Fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think `good' should be able to play anywhere, but maybe our
sensibility was nighttime more than nine o'clock in the morning,''
Brillstein said. ``I think it is very strange to wake up to some of
those sketches at nine o'clock in the morning.'' He said the show
needed more time to catch on and more night slots.
</P>
<P>
   Short was on vacation in Mexico last week and unavailable for
comment.

`RUDYARD KIPLING': BEHIND IMPERIALIST RHAPSODY, A CHILD ABANDONED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rudyard Kipling is one of the few writers to have their own
adjectives, but while that would normally be a mark of distinction,
in his case it is an ambiguous honor.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the orotund elegance of ``Jamesian,'' for example, or the
insinuative darkness of ``Kafkaesque,'' the word ``Kiplingesque''
has something comic and preposterous about it now. It summons up a
blimpish, condescending, epic-heroic, white-man's-burden
patriotism: not only jingoism but jingleism too.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all we have and are,'' Kipling wrote at the outbreak of
World War I, ``For all our children's fate/Stand up and take the
war./The Hun is at the gate!''
</P>
<P>
   The Kipling of lines like those, who was, as Robert Graves put
it, ``the literary aspect of the British Empire,'' is very much
part of the larger Kipling in this sure-handed new biography by
Harry Ricketts, an English editor of several editions of Kipling's
prose and poetry. But Ricketts' ``Rudyard Kipling: A Life'' shows a
more elusively full figure than the image of the writer that has
emerged over the last half-century or so.
</P>
<P>
   Kipling was, to be sure, a man who admired above all others
Cecil Rhodes, the imperial and imperious administrator of British
South Africa. In his later years Kipling seems to have been annoyed
at almost everybody _ Bolsheviks and Jews and suffragists as well
as British aristocrats and Liberals _ though he seems to have had a
particularly strong venom for the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   But Ricketts' Kipling was a man of contradictions who belonged
to the imperial club and judged it unfavorably at the same time.
Ricketts subjects Kipling's oeuvre, the many dozens of stories
especially, to an illuminating scrutiny and finds evidence that
this literary expression of the British Empire went more deeply
into the human realities of the experience of empire than just
about any other writer of his time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immediately outside of our own English life, is the dark and
crooked and fantastic, and wicked, and awe inspiring life of the
`native,''' Kipling, then a young journalist in India, wrote to a
friend, expressing at the same time a sense of superiority and a
frustrated desire to belong.
</P>
<P>
   One of the pleasures of reading Ricketts' book is its evocation
of the gingerly interaction between colonizer and colonized, with
its powerful sexual and social ambiguity, which Kipling's early
stories _ like ``In the House of Suddhoo'' or even ``The Man Who
Would Be King'' _ captured so well.

<P>
   Kipling was born in 1865 in Bombay, India, and at age 5 was
taken by his mother to England (``home,'' as it was called by the
Anglo-Indians) for schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Ricketts makes much of the fact that the young ``Rud'' spent
several unhappy years living with an elderly foster mother for whom
he developed an early and lasting antipathy. The theme of childhood
abandonment, of being cast out of the family, repeats itself,
Ricketts persuasively argues, in Kipling's stories. It is not a
coincidence, he contends, that Kipling's two most famous child
heroes, Kim and Mowgli of ``The Jungle Book,'' are orphans.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 17 Kipling returned to India to take a job as a
newspaper reporter in Lahore, and before he was 25 had achieved
considerable fame with what are still regarded as some of his best
short stories. Ricketts' accounts of those years reflect the
excitement but also the anxiety experienced by the young English
writer on the make in a land of intense exoticism.
</P>
<P>
   Kipling longed for female companionship and shied away from it
at the same time; he yearned to delve into India, and he was also
horrified by it in a way that prefigures the famous scene of Mrs.
Moore in E.M. Forster's ``Passage to India'' visiting the Malabar
caves.
</P>
<P>
   Kipling left India for good in 1889 and, in his years living in
the United States and England, he quickly became Kiplingesque, the
most visible exponent of muscular, nationalistic literary rhapsody,
tempered by a kind of patronizing large-mindedness: ``You're a
better man than I am Gunga Din.''
</P>
<P>
   But while that Kiplingesque tone seems grandly archaic now, in
Ricketts' view it makes Kipling much more of an outsider to
standard imperial pride than is often thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kim,'' perhaps Kipling's best novel, about an abandoned
English boy who lives as a native and is absorbed into the world of
spying and intrigue, is, as Ricketts calls it, ``a delighted
celebration of cultural and racial difference _ in the strongest
contrast to his White Man bluster.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately the bluster intensified as Kipling got older, and
he paid the terrible price of becoming a figure of satire and
parody. ``We are in a dreary plight when Mob-orator puts on the
Muse to move the country, and shows her as a slattern with a
furious jingle, to suit the country's taste,'' the novelist George
Meredith wrote to a friend at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Kipling never stopped enjoying ``an enviable popularity,'' as
Henry James ruefully called it, but he was more and more ``a
sitting target and a figure of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricketts gives us the private Kipling as well as the public one,
and contrasts the man who seemed to parody himself with the man
whose grief over the deaths of two of his children was boundless.
</P>
<P>
   Kipling's first child, a daughter born in the United States,
died early, and a son was killed in a German attack in World War I,
his body not found until long after Kipling's own death. The
personal tragedies, in Ricketts' view, made Kipling ``a sadder and
a harder man'' and are causes of the dark bluster that came in his
later years.
</P>
<P>
   On his last page Ricketts reminds us that when Kipling died in
1936, a ``national institution,'' The Times of London wrote, but no
longer a literary one, not a single writer served as a pallbearer.
That literary no-show represented an unfair judgment on Kipling as
a writer, which Ricketts' fine biography does much to set right.

   BALLSTON SPA, N.Y. _ Two years after Suzanne Lyall disappeared,
her words seep through the gloom that has settled over the house
where she grew up. Her mother, Mary, reads so intently from a worn
notebook of her daughter's poetry that she does not notice when a
loose page slips to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The poem, called ``Lost Memories,'' describes how a dead woman's
photos are callously discarded:
</P>
<P>
   ``And now it's really sad to say that these memories which meant
so much to her, are being thrown away, to be seen again never,
along with her soul, which is now being lowered into her burial
hole.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I always liked it,'' Mary Lyall said. ``It traces someone's
life and hopes and dreams, all wrapped up in these photos, and then
everything's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   After an awkward pause, Douglas Lyall adds forcefully that their
daughter's life will not be so easily forgotten. ``She's very much
with us,'' he said. ``That poem doesn't apply to us at all because
she's constantly in our minds and in our memories.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lyalls have desperately searched for Suzanne since she
disappeared at the age of 19 on March 2, 1998, while returning at
night to her dormitory room at the State University of New York at
Albany. As time passed and promising leads faded, police officials
began investigating the case as a homicide. And the Lyalls turned
their efforts to protecting other students, becoming the state's
leading crusaders for campus safety laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not political people, we're just folks up the road in
Ballston Spa,'' said Douglas Lyall, 58, a retired vocational
counselor in this middle-class suburb about 30 miles north of
Albany. ``But if you wait for the politicians to propose
legislation on their own, sometimes it won't happen. People can
identify with us _ Suzi could be anybody's daughter, anybody's
sister _ that's what it comes down to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lyalls were the driving force last year behind the passage
of a law that requires all colleges and universities in New York to
adopt security plans that ensure prompt investigation of violent
crimes and missing students. This year, they have collected more
than 25,000 signatures in support of another school-safety measure,
named for Suzanne and modeled after legislation for drug-free
school zones. It would increase penalties for violent crimes
committed within 1,000 feet of colleges and universities, schools
and day care centers.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was endorsed by Gov. George Pataki and sailed
through the Republican-led Senate after being sponsored by Joseph
Bruno, the majority leader, who represents the Lyalls' hometown. It
has stalled for now in the Democratic-led Assembly. Several
Assembly Democrats and advocacy groups have opposed the proposal
with the argument that it would not deter hardened criminals but
would suggest that crimes committed at schools are somehow worse
than those committed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But many lawmakers remain hopeful that the Lyalls will bring
enough pressure on Assembly leaders to force action on the proposal
_ in much the same way that Jenna's Law, named for a nursing
student killed by a parolee in Albany, finally passed in 1998. That
law sharply restricted parole for first-time violent felons.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver has already signaled that he
will not again underestimate public sentiment, especially in an
election year. ``The dedication of the Lyall family to their cause
reminds us there is more that must be done,'' Silver said on the
second anniversary of Suzanne Lyall's disappearance. ``The Assembly
is now developing a comprehensive college security proposal that
will be acted on this year,'' he said, without detailing what that
plan will be.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Lyall, a quiet woman who often expressed herself through
poetry, grew up the youngest of three children in a close-knit
family. Mary Lyall, 57, a homemaker, still laughs when she
describes how her daughter once jumped out of the shower, her hair
foamy with shampoo, to jot a verse.
</P>
<P>
   The night she disappeared, she had just finished her part-time
job in a computer store at the Crossgates Mall in Albany. There
were no signs that she reached her dorm room, her parents said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as their hopes dimmed, the Lyalls sought to salvage
something positive from their ordeal. They heard about another
student, Kristin Smart, who disappeared from California Polytechnic
State University in San Luis Obispo in 1996. Her parents helped
pass a state law that requires campus police to sign written
agreements with local law enforcement agencies to avoid delays in
the investigation of a violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   The Lyalls wanted to push for a similar campus safety law in New
York. Although the SUNY police responded quickly to their calls,
Douglas Lyall said, they did not immediately bring in the state
police. New York's campus safety law, which was based on the one in
California, was signed by Pataki in April.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the Lyalls have been circulating petitions by
the thousands to pressure Assembly leaders into passing Suzanne's
Law. Even their opponents concede that they have made inroads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians are quick to jump on these things,'' said Alice P.
Green, executive director of the Center for Law and Justice, a
nonprofit education group in Albany. ``You can gather a lot of
sympathy for the family _ and make no mistake, I feel for them _
but I also work with many families where a child is killed and no
one does anything.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Lyalls' ranch house, petitions advocating Suzanne's Law
overflow from neatly stacked cardboard boxes. The Lyalls said they
would not allow themselves to give up hope that their daughter is
still alive, but they sometimes lapse into the past tense when
describing her to strangers.
</P>
<P>
   As Mary Lyall brings out sodas and homemade chocolate-chip
cookies, she points to four jars of orange marmalade stacked on the
counter. She made them a few days before her daughter disappeared.
``We stopped living two years ago, and the jars have been sitting
there ever since,'' she said. ``There's something about moving them
that bothers me.''

`HOUSE ARREST': DON'T SEND IN THE CLOWNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The choice of ringmaster, in any case, couldn't be
better. Studs Terkel, the grand old man of oral history, shows up
with a shuffling, lopsided walk, an Olympian laugh and a flair for
the dramatic gesture, to usher in ``House Arrest,'' Anna Deavere
Smith's wide-ranging and unwieldy consideration of the circus that
is the American presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Actually that's Terkel as channeled by Smith, who is famous for
her one-woman shows in which she portrays an assortment of real
people whom she has interviewed to create mosaic portraits of the
state of a nation. Smith's theater pieces have often been compared
to Terkel's books, and the melding of the writer and the
performance artist here seems a fitting act of homage.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Terkel also has innate theatrical value, which
cannot be said of every person represented in this
two-and-a-half-hour production.
</P>
<P>
   In the monologues that begin and conclude ``House Arrest,''
which opened Sunday night at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, Terkel
_ or Smith's version of Terkel _ does indeed give off the
vaudevillian grandeur of the old pro who has seen it all and knows
that when it comes to politics these days, everything is just show
biz, kid.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the current tenant of the White House and the sex
scandal that dominated his second term, Terkel hits upon his mot
juste with a crow of victory. ``Not the crowning touch but the
clowning touch,'' he says. ``It ends with a fright wig, putty nose,
with baggy pants ...''
</P>
<P>
   Send in the clowns, indeed. Or to borrow further from the same
Stephen Sondheim song: Don't bother; they're here. And it is
Smith's suggestion that they have been here for a couple of
centuries, if never before so visibly.
</P>
<P>
   That all the presidency is a stage isn't really a new idea, but
it certainly has promise as the basis for an evening of theater.
Unfortunately, while ``House Arrest'' is a handsomely mounted work
(Jo Bonney is credited as the ``directorial consultant'') that
offers copious evidence of its creator's exceptional talents, Smith
makes good on that promise only fitfully.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike her earlier works _ ``Fires in the Mirror,'' an
examination of racial violence in Brooklyn, and ``Twilight: Los
Angeles, 1992'' about the repercussions of the Rodney King trial in
Los Angeles _ ``House Arrest'' isn't anchored to one particular
historical moment. And it has a more rambling, ruminative style,
without the same cohesive passion that characterized ``Fires'' in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   The work's subtitle, ``A Search for the American Character in
and Around the White House, Past and Present,'' gives some
indication of its daunting breadth of focus. Smith, who began this
project in 1995 and interviewed 425 people for it, has said she has
had to keep rewriting ``House'' as history kept running ahead of
it. (There have been several previous versions of the work, which,
in a departure for Smith, used an ensemble of actors.)
</P>
<P>
   There is another, larger problem: the incredible amount of
dialogue, in print and on the air, that has already been generated
by the subjects addressed here. The events leading up to and
surrounding the impeachment of President William Jefferson Clinton
have been examined from so many angles, personal and polemical,
that both vertigo and subject fatigue set in long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with access to a keyboard or a microphone, it seemed,
became a pundit and often a pundit on the subject of everyone
else's punditry. Smith has interviewed a weighty share of those
folk, from magazine journalists to politicians turned memoirists.
The question arises whether what is already a hall of mirrors can
benefit from yet another reflective surface.
</P>
<P>
   As a performer, of course, Smith is a mirror unto herself,
turning the delivery of transcribed interviews into anatomies of
language. And it can be fun to watch her dissections, achieved
through a sort of aural italics that highlight the often
unconscious watchwords of her subjects.
</P>
<P>
   These include George Stephanopoulos (the former presidential
assistant), Peggy Noonan (the one-time speech writer for President
George Bush), Ed Bradley (of ``60 Minutes''), R.W. Apple Jr. (of
The New York Times) and Graydon Carter (the editor of ``Vanity
Fair''). Then there are the fleeting evocations of the presidents
themselves, ranging from Jefferson and Lincoln to Bush and, in an
oddly forgettable scene in the evening's second half, Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Smith fluidly conjures her interviews and renderings of
historical text through minimal props _ a martini glass or a coffee
cup, perhaps _ and the donning and doffing of jackets and the
random accessory. The transformations are elegantly set off by
Richard Hoover's efficiently shifting set and Batwin and Robin's
inventive projections.
</P>
<P>
   It is often hard, however, to escape the feeling that what's
going on here is an animated Reader's Digest, especially when Smith
is embodying contemporary figures. She puts across the (often
familiar) points they are making _ Stephanopoulos on the Faustian
bargain of the presidency, for example, or Bradley on how
politicians and members of the press hold one another in captivity
_ without offering much insight into the speakers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The patterns realized by the juxtaposition of the interviews can
be more enlightening. ``House Arrest'' finds a resonant chain of
echoes in both historical and contemporary accounts of the very
public nature of the United States' highest public office, of the
president as superstar whose actions are monitored and to some
extent determined by a restless audience of fans and critics.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson's presumed liaison with the slave Sally Hemings was
certainly not chronicled in its time as President Clinton's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky has been. But Smith evokes the
hard-drinking newspaperman James Callender, whose salacious account
of the Jefferson-Hemings scandal has a definite whiff of prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   And in becoming two latter-day scholars with very different
points of view on Jefferson's sexuality, she reminds us how
subjective and dangerously distracting such considerations are. The
documentary filmmaker Ken Burns is represented to point out that
the significant issue is less whether Jefferson slept with Sally
Hemings than the fact that he owned her to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, by the evening's second half Smith takes detours
from her portrait of the presidency to offer examples of the kind
of great ``moral slippage'' (a term invoked by Terkel) that she
sees happening today while much of the country obsesses on
presidential sexual practices. There is a long monologue toward the
show's end by a woman in a Maryland prison who watched her lover
beat her child to death.
</P>
<P>
   By that time you have the definite impression that Smith,
confronted with the vastness of her subject, has lost control of
her material. There are original flames of insight buried in
``House Arrest.'' What Smith does, for example, with the idea of
presidential assassinations as a form of national theater, from
Lincoln's to John F. Kennedy's, is sharp and harrowing.
</P>
<P>
   Smith could no doubt spin an entire spellbinding evening from
that theme alone. As it is, she emerges as a wanderer in an immense
forest of facts and ideas who, somewhere along the way, lost her
compass.
</P>

A PLAN TO WIRE AN ENTIRE GEORGIA TOWN WITH THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By LAURIE J. FLYNN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leave it to La Grange. The small Georgia city 60 miles southwest
of Atlanta, already the regional home of several Fortune 500
corporations, now intends to become the largest entirely wired town
so far in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   According to a plan announced last week, every household,
school, government office and retail store in town will be
connected to one giant high-speed network. The system is being
created by combining the town's existing fiber-optic network with
coaxial cable from Charter Communications, the local cable
provider. The system, to be paid for by the municipal government,
is to be fully in place by fall.
</P>
<P>
   Households and businesses will receive free installation, which
includes a cable modem for Internet access. And for at least the
first year, Internet service is to be provided free to each user.
</P>
<P>
   Any home without a personal computer will receive an access
device and keyboard to attach to the television set, said the
mayor, Jeff Lukken. The city, which has a population of 27,000,
will provide Internet access through WorldGate Communications,
which specializes in interactive television.
</P>
<P>
   What prompted the project, called the La Grange Internet TV
Initiative?
</P>
<P>
   Lukken said one big motivation was La Grange's role as home to
the regional operations of Fortune 500 companies, including
Caterpillar, Kimberly-Clark and Georgia-Pacific. The network,
Lukken said, should help the town attract and keep big employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to have a work force with the right skills, the
ones that meet the standards that information technology companies
command,'' Lukken said.
</P>
<P>
   The network will also let teachers communicate more easily with
parents, and enable more students to use the Internet at home, he
said. Retailers in town will be able to open online stores to help
them compete on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The network and equipment will cost the city roughly $300,000,
mostly to wire those households that do not already receive basic
cable television service _ about 2,200 of La Grange's 11,000 homes
_ and to supply the necessary set-top hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Besides providing set-top Internet-access devices for those
households without PCs, the city plans to send technicians into
homes to train people unfamiliar with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Grange is a very progressive city,'' said Jerry Kent, chief
executive of Charter. ``But like all communities, they are afraid
of falling behind. This helps them attract businesses and people to
the town.''

DIVINING THE LOOK OF THE NEXT HOUSE IN A CLOSE CONTEST
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The contest for control of the House of
Representatives is as close as the margin in the House itself,
where the 11-vote Republican majority is the smallest in nearly
half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, whose campaign committee reported $19 million cash on
hand compared with half as much for the Republicans at the end of
1999, seem poised to erase, or at least blur, the GOP's traditional
money advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans, with control of the House, can set the late
summer-early fall agenda of roll call votes. If they think they
need to, they can give ground on some key measure the way they did
on health care and welfare in 1996. Then their incumbents could
boast of having delivered, for example, on prescription drugs for
the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have an advantage in that 23 Republicans, some of them
abiding by term-limits pledges they made in 1994, are retiring.
Party shifts occur most frequently in these open seats, and
Democrats have only seven retirees whose seats they must defend.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers give mixed messages. With 222 Republicans and
one independent who votes with them to 211 Democrats and their one
independent, it would take a net loss of six Republican seats to
oust Dennis Hastert of Illinois from the speaker's chair and
replace him with Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Out of 435 House seats, a net shift of six amounts to a change
of only 1.4 percent, or less than the margin of error in any
election poll taken this year. But because incumbents win
re-election at rates that would have made the old Supreme Soviet
proud (98.3 percent won in 1998), and more than half of those open
seats are safe, the real battleground is much smaller. If there are
40 real races by fall, a net change of six amounts to a 15 percent
shift. If there are just 25, a six-seat shift equals 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   National polls are not much help. The latest public polls really
show no more than the absence of any national trend. In 1994, when
they gained 52 seats, Republicans got 53.6 percent of the two-party
House vote and 52.9 percent of the seats (excluding the one
independent), or 230 in all. When they lost eight seats but held a
majority in 1996, they got 50.2 percent of the votes. Their vote
improved a bit in 1998, to 50.5 percent, but they lost five more
seats.
</P>
<P>
   Even a poll that showed a 53-47 edge for either party would
prove very little, considering the plus or minus three percentage
point margin of sampling error that is customary. But the public
polls show no such advantage anyhow. A CBS News poll of 909
registered voters conducted by telephone from March 19 through 21
found 40 percent of registered voters saying they would vote for a
Republican candidate for the House, and 40 percent saying they
would vote for a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   So anticipating House elections usually requires figuring them
out, seat by seat, a difficult task when races seem slow to take
shape and candidates are, in the words of Ed Goeas, a Republican
pollster, ``kind of plodding along and doing the things they need
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Washington this kind of seat-by-seat guesswork has become
a cottage industry, engaging not only the political parties but
highly specialized elements of the press. The best-known of these
is probably Charles Cook, who wrote in last week's National Journal
that ``an analysis of each of the 435 districts suggests that the
outcome in November will probably range between a Republican gain
of three seats to a Democratic gain of five, one seat short of a
majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook counts 16 seats as tossups that ``either party has a good
chance of winning.'' Five of them are now held by Democrats and 11
by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   He says 13 seats now held by Democrats lean Democratic, while
two lean Republican, and 17 Republican seats lean Republican. His
definition of lean is a competitive race with one side still the
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Cook's third tier consists of 26 Democratic seats he
thinks Democrats are ``likely'' to hold, and 20 Republican seats
the GOP is ``likely'' to retain. Such seats, he wrote ``are not
considered competitive at this point but have the potential to
become engaged.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Each party recognizes that the easy targets are gone. Vulnerable
Democrats either lost or quit in 1992 and 1994. The 1994 Republican
landslide, a truly national election, engineered by Newt Gingrich,
swept into office newcomers of all levels of merit. They included a
few Republicans whom Gingrich never expected to make it to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   So 12 of the 1994 Republican freshmen were defeated in 1996 and
two more were beaten in 1998. A few others who would have been
beaten, like Enid Greene of Utah and Wes Cooley of Oregon, retired
when scandals caught up with them. By now no one left in the House
is as obviously vulnerable as Greene was after her husband played
fast and loose with campaign money or Cooley was after he was
caught lying about having served in Korea during the war.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This year, in fact, there are just two members whose political
acts have invited defeat and they both come from that same
Republican class of 1994. But the first, Rep. Michael Forbes of New
York, is now a Democrat. Forbes switched in 1999, accusing
Republican leaders of being ``tone deaf'' to ordinary Americans'
concerns. His party is his problem, in a Suffolk County district he
carried with 64 percent of the vote as a Republican in 1998. Not
only are Republicans fighting to reclaim the seat, but some local
Democrats are unhappy with his conservative views on guns and
abortion. Forbes cannot expect the easy ride that several Southern
Democrats who switched to the GOP got when they ran as Republicans
in the 90s.
</P>
<P>
   The other is Rep. George Nethercutt of Washington, who kept his
Republican identity, but abandoned the term-limits pledge, to serve
no longer than six years, that got him elected. Nethercutt defeated
Tom Foley, the speaker of the House and an intense critic of term
limits, but now seems convinced that Foley was right about the
value of experience. The term-limits movement has lost strength
since 1994, but with all the fury it can still muster it will make
independent expenditures to join Democrats in trying to defeat
Nethercutt.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Aside from those cases, the 25 to 40 real contests for House
seats will hinge mainly on local personalities and local issues or
occasionally on national issues crafted in local terms. Democrats,
for example, have high hopes that gun control will help them in a
few tossup seats, especially in the suburbs. Alan Secrest, a
Democratic pollster who works House races, said: ``Everybody favors
trigger locks. Most people favor background checks.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither party is counting on the presidential campaign to win it
seats. Back before Gov. George W. Bush of Texas had a primary fight
on his hands, Republicans seemed to count on him to sweep to a
victory big enough to solidify their shaky House majority. They do
not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, they may have been dreaming. Presidential coattails
have not been a major factor in House elections since Ronald Reagan
won in 1980 and Republicans gained 33 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the two parties should put the presidential election out
of their minds entirely. The last two presidents actually saw their
party lose House seats when they won the White House. Republicans
lost three when President Bush was elected in 1988. Democrats lost
11 with President Clinton in 1992.

CHARITABLE GROUPS FIND REVENUE IN RETAILING GOODS ON THEIR WEB
SITES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Companies involved in e-commerce have always seemed a lot like
not-for-profit operations _ constantly on the lookout for new
funding and constantly losing money, all the while stressing that
profits are not the immediate priority.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities are becoming greater still, as nonprofit groups
have begun to rely on e-commerce to generate revenues and
streamline their organizations. Nonprofits with disparate missions,
like the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Rifle
Association and Save the Children, now sell goods online, while
institutions like the Pew Charitable Trusts use the Internet to
skim inefficiency from the paper-intensive grant process.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, these groups are not only finding new sources of
money, they are also making better use of the money they already
have.
</P>
<P>
   Save the Children, an international children's relief charity,
is a case in point. According to Aggie Stern, who runs the
charity's retail division, the organization cannot afford to mail
more than one catalog annually to its 100,000 patrons. Yet the
group suspected that there was year-round demand for the ties,
jewelry and other goods that it sells at its headquarters in
Westport, Conn., and in limited amounts through other retailers.
</P>
<P>
   So in mid-November it began selling the same goods on its Web
site (www.savethechildren.org), regularly updating the merchandise.
The results have been amazing, Stern said. The organization expects
to sell $300,000 of merchandise over the Web this year, she said,
while maintaining a similar level of sales in the store and catalog
operations combined.
</P>
<P>
   Such success stories are spreading quickly in the nonprofit
sector, said H. Robert Wientzen, chief executive of the Direct
Marketing Association, many of whose members are nonprofit
organizations. Wientzen said that a recent association report
showed that of the $102 billion that nonprofits raised from all
sources last year, $18 billion came from selling products mail
order and on the Internet _ $2 billion more than in 1998, and $5
billion more than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not break out mail order and Internet sales, but
Wientzen said e-commerce was responsible for a significant amount
of that growth. ``Nonprofits are finding that the Internet makes
niche marketing even more palatable and profitable than direct
mail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, a nonprofit company that sells goods
through a catalog could sell the same amount of goods on the
Internet while spending 80 percent less, ``presuming you have a
site that's attracting people.''
</P>
<P>
   His caveat underscores a complicating factor for other
nonprofits looking to copy the success of Save the Children and
others. To begin with, as the for-profit e-commerce companies have
shown, building a site's traffic can be costly and arduous. But
even if organizations can somehow clear that hurdle _ by promoting
the Web site on every piece of fund-raising literature mailed, for
instance _ other sizable obstacles remain.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are finding staff with the time, expertise and
interest to maintain the Web site; convincing donors that a retail
operation will somehow advance a charity's mission; and, of course,
dealing with the customer service and fulfillment issues that have
brought even retail giants like Toys ``R'' Us to their knees in the
online realm.
</P>
<P>
   Stern, of Save the Children, said the organization's experience
with catalog marketing helped smooth the transition to Web sales
because the fulfillment and customer service systems had already
been established through the group's catalog. Even so, in the
middle of last year's holiday rush, the Web site generated so many
orders for Save the Children's goods that one company Stern hired
to help pack and ship items failed to keep up, forcing the
organization to take back those duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was madness,'' said Stern, who relies on part-time help to
handle the holiday rush. ``I can tell war stories from now until
tomorrow, but we're still very happy with the site.''
</P>
<P>
   The complexities of building a full-scale e-commerce operation
have been enough to prevent some other nonprofits from looking at
their Web stores as anything but marginal revenue builders. The
American Civil Liberties Union, for one, is taking a gradual
approach to building its Web store, which opened last year
(www.aclu.org).
</P>
<P>
   According to Loren Siegel, the organization's director of public
education, the ACLU devotes ``a tiny percentage'' of one staff
person's time to the Web store, which sells pamphlets, videos and
apparel, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the scant effort devoted to the Web store, Siegel said
it generated $50,000 in revenues last year, to go along with
$50,000 the organization raised through a one-page list of items it
included in newsletters. But that revenue has not yet been enough
to outpace the fulfillment, Web development and merchandising costs
associated with the store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission is not to make money,'' Siegel said. Instead, by
selling literature, the store helps disseminate information central
to the organization's programs, she said, while the apparel sales
build public awareness of the ACLU ``But we are still hopeful that
by using this medium for distribution, we will eventually make a
profit.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While e-commerce has provided a promising new tool for some
nonprofits, it has actually spawned other charities. Hugging Hands
International (www.hugginghands.org), a Web-based organization that
was founded last April to give money to children's charities,
``would not have been possible without the Net,'' said Jim Meyers,
a co-founder of Hugging Hands.
</P>
<P>
   The site features a gallery of children's artworks, but it does
not yet sell them. Instead, it uses the art to attract more than
100,000 monthly visitors to the site. Based on that traffic, the
organizers secure advertising sponsorships from corporate partners,
a portion of which goes to charities. Anderson Consulting is the
current sponsor, but Meyers said other ``million dollar''
sponsorships were pending.
</P>
<P>
   In the back offices of other nonprofit organizations, the
Internet is bringing changes that are less quantifiable, but no
less profound, said Ken Weber, director of nonprofit client
services for AppNet, an Internet consulting firm. ``More often than
not, the product that nonprofits deal with is information,'' Weber
said, ``and the Internet is helping them move that information much
more efficiently than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   One example of that is found at the Philadelphia-based Pew
Charitable Trusts, which gave nearly $250 million to nonprofit
groups last year. Because the trust, by definition, needs no annual
income from outside sources, the organization does not need to sell
goods on its Web site (www.pewtrusts.com). But according to David
Morse, a Pew spokesman, it has been able to cut ``substantial
costs'' from its operation simply by allowing prospective grant
recipients to submit some parts of their grant applications online.
</P>
<P>
   Morse said the organization might also build an extranet, or
password-protected Web site, so its grant recipients can
communicate more effectively with each other and with the Pew
trusts. A reason not to do so, however, may be that Pew's
beneficiaries do not always have the time or technical expertise to
make effective use of such a system.

   ``While we're hopeful about all of this, we also have to bear in
mind that we're trying to make our grantees more effective _ not
foist the latest tool or gadget on them just because we find it
interesting,'' he said. ``We want it to be a case where if we build
it, they will come.''

US AIRWAYS STRIKE THREAT SHOWS DRAWBACKS OF E-TICKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE SHARKEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Greenwald couldn't resist a little gloating as he and other
travel agents prepared to deal over the weekend with the
possibility of a shutdown of US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a travel agent, you're on your own,'' he said. ``It's
a minefield out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenwald, a co-owner of Personalized Travel, a small travel
agency in Washington, was referring to a fault line in the current
air-travel landscape that was exposed as US Airways customers
worried about finding alternative flights last week. Increasingly,
whether purchased over the phone, at a travel agency, or online,
the standard air ticket is now a paperless electronic ticket, or
e-ticket, that exists only on an airline's computers.
</P>
<P>
   But until US Airways and its flight attendants reached a
tentative accord early Saturday morning, passengers holding
e-tickets for US Airways flights faced a real dilemma. While other
airlines and even Amtrak said they would try to accommodate US
Airways passengers with paper tickets, travelers with e-tickets
could not expect such service. Computers at different airlines do
not yet communicate well enough to share information on tickets
that have been issued electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents said they were ready to issue paper tickets to
customers who had booked e-tickets through them, but noted that
they could not help travelers who had bypassed travel agents to buy
tickets online from an Internet travel site or by telephone.
``There's nothing a travel agent can do for them in this kind of
situation because we're not involved in the transaction,''
Greenwald said.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic tickets represent 61 percent of the $75 billion in
tickets booked annually on the Sabre Holdings Corp., the company
that operates the main computer reservations system used by travel
agencies and others, according to Nancy Raynor, Sabre's senior vice
president for emerging businesses.
</P>
<P>
   As the strike deadline neared, US Airways said holders of
e-tickets could make arrangements at a US Airways ticket counter to
get paper tickets. But staffing at those counters could have been
affected by a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwald's agency, however, offered to print out US Airways
tickets for its customers with e-tickets and deliver them by
messenger last week. ``That way, you have a document in your hand,
an actual US Airways ticket that is a negotiable instrument,'' he
said. The service, which would not be necessary under normal
circumstances, is included in the $20 fee the agency charges to
write an air ticket, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbluth Interactive, the online subsidiary of a major
world-wide travel agency, Rosenbluth International, mailed paper
tickets to hundreds of customers with e-tickets on US Airways
flights, said Neal Bibeau, the president of Rosenbluth Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   The US Airways strike threat ``was the first event of this
magnitude to create this kind of focus on e-tickets,'' said Bibeau,
who added that his company's online booking site, Biztravel.com,
sent out the paper duplicates over a week ago when it became clear
that the strike threat was real.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, Bibeau said, customers like
e-tickets, which can not be misplaced or lost like paper tickets.
Ninety percent of the airline tickets booked on Biztravel.com are
electronic. ``People have the option to request paper tickets, but
we don't see it often,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the strike loomed, though, we thought it would be
appropriate for our travelers to notify them proactively that there
would be a benefit in this specific situation to have a paper
ticket,'' he added. ``In a situation like that, you're just better
off having a paper ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for traditional travel agents, who have suffered
in recent years as airlines have cut commissions, their competitive
edge in this kind of service may not last much longer. Sabre last
month announced that it had joined an alliance with EncrypTix Inc.,
a new company formed by Stamps.com, which offers technology
allowing businesses and home-computer users to print out postal
stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Sabre intends to help develop this technology to allow customers
on its various Internet sites to book and print out paper tickets
for sports and entertainment events. Later this year, Raynor said,
Sabre also expects to be able to offer e-tickets that can be
printed out, with a special bar code that will make them as readily
acceptable as traditional paper tickets. Airline ticket counters
will be equipped with new scanners to read the tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The next phase of electronic ticket technology, however, will be
a link between all of the airlines computer systems, ``so that if
you have an electronic ticket on one airline, the other airlines
would be able find that information and honor the ticket,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even that will not mean the end of paper tickets. ``The
reality is, if you look at travelers, starting with the experienced
road warrior and going to the mom and dad and kids who take a
vacation once every couple of years, there will always be people
who require or prefer to have a piece of paper,'' she said. ``They
want that document.''

   LIBERTY MEDIA PLANS TO TAKE $130 MILLION STAKE IN IDT
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining its drive into the telecommunications industry, John
C. Malone's Liberty Media Group has agreed to invest $130 million
for a stake of almost 10 percent in IDT, the communications carrier
based in Hackensack, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Until AT&AMP;T's acquisition of Tele-Communications last year,
Liberty was TCI's television programming unit. But over the last
year, the company has shown interest in telecommunications. IDT
regularly takes a leading role in creating communications niches.

headphones to hear a description of the on-screen action, has been
developed by the National Center for Accessible Media, which is
trying to adapt existing systems to enable the deaf and the blind
to go to conventional theaters.

<P>
   A DRAWBACK TO AIRLINE E-TICKETS
</P>
<P>
   The potential strike by flight attendants at US Airways, which
was averted over the weekend, exposed one drawback of the
electronic ticket not bought through a travel agent. While other
airlines and even Amtrak said they would try to accommodate
passengers with paper tickets, travelers with e-tickets could not
expect such service. Computers at different airlines do not yet
communicate well enough to share information on e-tickets.
</P>
<P>
   A SHIFT, PERHAPS, IN ONLINE VISION
</P>
<P>
   The only vision required to make zillions of dollars in the
Internet economy is nearsightedness. The stock market remains so
irrationally exuberant that almost every dot-com company can pick
up $10 million or so in venture capital and make a bundle either on
a quick initial public offering or acquisition, with nary a glance
toward long-term viability _ or long-term investors. But the view
may be shifting, with more emphasis placed on the creation of
substantial businesses, common sense and ethics.

OPEC TO REACH AGREEMENT ON INCREASING OIL PRODUCTION  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ The Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries is on the verge of an agreement to increase its oil
production limits by about 1.7 million barrels a day, officials
from several oil exporting countries said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the exact numbers are still being debated and the
increase is less than the 2.5 million barrels sought by a Clinton
administration worried about the ramifications of high gasoline
prices, the increase is somewhat larger than many analysts had
expected. It could reduce the price of oil by several dollars a
barrel, but exactly when and whether that gets passed on to the
consumer remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   One senior OPEC official said the increase would almost exactly
reverse the production cuts the cartel agreed upon one year ago,
which sent oil prices soaring and ignited a political uproar in the
United States as U.S. gasoline prices surged to more than $1.60 a
gallon in many cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this number will result in bringing back market
stability,'' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``It is a reasonable increase, a very reasonable increase to make
sure there are reasonable stocks in the second quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was much uncertainty about the final outcome when
OPEC oil ministers meet here on Monday, the official firmly shook
his head.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, OPEC's second largest producer after Saudi Arabia, is
among several countries still opposed to such a big boost in
production. But other OPEC officials predicted that they would
agree on an increase of at least 1.5 million barrels a day _ but
more likely 1.7 million _ levels that have been urged particularly
by the Saudis.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is being discussed is a return of the 1.7 million barrels
that were removed from production last year,'' Kuwait's oil
minister, Sheik Saud Nasser al-Sabah, said in an interview here
Sunday night. Although he described an increase in production as a
move driven by politics rather than economics, he predicted a boost
would be agreed at or close to the levels sought by Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   He also said oil prices were likely to fall. ``The market will
look at this as an increase, and will react by reducing prices,''
the Kuwaiti minister predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The recent surge in gasoline prices has become a major
election-year topic in the United States. Lawmakers in Congress
have lambasted OPEC countries in recent weeks and accused Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait of paying no heed to the United States' role in
rescuing Kuwait from Iraq during the Persian Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, the likely Republican presidential nominee, has
called for a big reduction in gasoline taxes. Vice President Al
Gore, the expected Democratic nominee, has been peppered with
complaints and the Clinton administration waged an intense lobbying
campaign to persuade OPEC countries about a big increase in
production.
</P>
<P>
   Oil ministers from the 11 nations in OPEC will meet here on
Monday to formally discuss the plan. But the countries have already
been talking for weeks and have held intensive meetings here in the
last few days.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts cautioned that the expected increase will probably have
only a modest impact on gasoline prices, probably no more than 10
cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, said Gary N. Ross, president of PIRA Energy Group,
an oil industry consulting firm, the increases would have a
tangible impact and coincide with unexpectedly weak demand for oil
in the first months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have made it clear they want to see lower prices,'' Ross
said, referring to the Saudis. ``They want to get oil out of the
newspaper headlines.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   The last two years have shown that oil prices are notoriously
difficult to predict, for OPEC or for anybody else. Few analysts,
if any, expected prices to plunge as low as $11 a barrel one year
ago, just as few if any predicted their abrupt surge to about $28 a
barrel today.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ginoux, head of the oil trading desk at Salomon Smith
Barney in London, said increasing OPEC's quota by 1.7 million
barrels is inherently less than it appears.
</P>
<P>
   That is because OPEC nations are already cheating on their own
restrictions, overshooting their official limit of 23 million
barrels a day by about 1 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that any official increase simply substitutes for
the unofficial cheating, the real increase could be as little as 1
million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   And though cheating could continue at nearly the present pace,
many smaller OPEC producers are already producing at nearly their
current capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Noncompliance can only come now from the big guys, and they
are the ones who are charged with keeping prices up,'' Ginoux said
Sunday. ``If we take the net new supply to be 1 million barrels a
day, I am horribly afraid that this will go to restocking _ and
probably keep prices right where they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Within OPEC, the view is considerably different.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has argued loudly that OPEC should not raise production by
more than about 700,000 or one million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   And even pro-Western countries like Kuwait are worried about a
repeat of the catastrophic decline in prices that occurred after
OPEC raised production modestly in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am worried,'' said al-Sabah. ``The market has already
dropped by $5 a barrel. I don't see any compelling reason to
increase production other than to be political, to be quite
honest.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the total increase in production extends beyond the
official OPEC quotas. Mexico, Norway and Oman, who are not members
of the oil cartel, all joined in with OPEC last year, slashing
their combined production by about 400,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials have already said they plan to raise their
output by as much as 300,000 barrels. Norway said it will decide
the issue after OPEC meets, but it will probably go back to its
earlier levels as well.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that there is Iraq, which is part of OPEC but is
allowed to pump at maximum levels under a system regulated by the
U.N. sanctions program installed after the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq slashed its production to about 700,000 barrels a day last
year, complaining that it couldn't get the parts it needed. But
after conciliatory moves by the United Nations, Iraq announced this
week that it will go back to full production in the next few
months.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials refused to comment Sunday night on OPEC's likely
production increases, saying it would be premature. But although
the increases are less than those advocated by Bill Richardson, the
secretary of energy, the Clinton administration is likely to
express relief.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many OPEC countries that have good relations
with the United States are angry at what they see as the Americans'
heavy-handed pressure in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is strange that the champion of the free market economy is
acting in a way that would put Marxists to shame,'' the daily Saudi
Gazette said in an editorial on threats by Congress to impose
sanctions if OPEC does not raise production. The editorial
denounced the effort as ``an atrocious proposal which violates the
norms of the market and defies common sense.''

TECHNOLOGY HAS MADE SOME PEOPLE MONEY, BUT IS THAT ALL THERE IS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once heard the technology pundit and historian Paul Saffo say,
``Never mistake a clear view for a short distance'' _ a witty
caveat that surely must be the understatement of the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   It was a truth that struck close to the bone while I was
preparing to write this, my last Digital Commerce column. (I'm
starting a nonprofit research venture.)
</P>
<P>
   While browsing through my archives, more than 15 years' worth of
articles and speeches and commentary for various publications and
venues, I recalled the days when telling people that you wrote
about technology was like dropping a stink bomb at a political
rally. You could clear the place in 10 seconds flat.
</P>
<P>
   Then I came across the first piece I wrote that detailed the
enormous challenge facing copyright law as digital media gained
commercial ascendancy. The year was 1990. But only now is the
battle fully engaged between copyright holders and citizens who
demand their legal right to copy. The pieces I wrote describing the
challenges of online privacy and censorship were even longer ago,
in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Never mistake a clear view for a short distance, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all of technology's new exposure and celebrity, many
executives and other industry experts are increasingly and deeply
troubled by the turn the Internet industry, in particular, has
taken.
</P>
<P>
   Technology and business strategists like John Doerr, the venture
capitalist, who by this point has nearly the name-brand recognition
of Coke, once saw in digital technology _ and particularly the
Internet _ a universe of bankable ideas. It was a fertile breeding
ground that could both change the world and make a ton of money.
</P>
<P>
   The result, as we have heard Doerr say so many times the last
five years, has been the greatest legal creation of wealth in
history.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past, investors knew that a company's successful
public stock offering only signaled a promising start, not the
final bell. A company that lasted was the real proof of their
vision.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the only vision required to make zillions of dollars in
the Internet economy is nearsightedness. The stock market remains
so irrationally exuberant that almost every me-too dot-com company
can pick up $10 million or so in venture funding and make a bundle
either on a quick initial public offering or acquisition, with nary
a glance toward long-term viability _ or long-term investors, for
that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the focus on money, money, money that we encounter
daily in the Internet economy is almost impossible to discuss
rationally in most quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Try telling someone hit by the money truck (or waiting to be),
that the making of millions overnight does not justify the present
means _ like poor business practices, rejection of even sensible
government oversight and early profit-taking _ that leaves the
dregs of dot-com reality for the public to deal with. Say that out
loud and you, too, can live the experience of clearing a room in 10
seconds flat.
</P>
<P>
   But even to my somewhat jaundiced eye, it appears that something
is shifting.
</P>
<P>
   Venture investors, the rocket fuel of the Internet economy, have
started to question the path that so many Internet companies have
taken _ despite the tremendous profit they make from the present
state of affairs. In fact, at a recent conference, Doerr apologized
to the assembled crowd for his ``legal creation of wealth'' remark,
saying that he never expected everyone to focus on the money, to
the exclusion of creating substantial businesses.
</P>
<P>
   He credits some of his new perspective to a book he has been
brandishing in public the last couple of months. ``The Monk and the
Riddle: The Education of a Silicon Valley Entrepreneur'' (Harvard
Business School Press, 2000) was written by Randy Komisar, a
longtime player in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Komisar, in fact, has seen the game from nearly every angle _
lawyer, co-founder of the Claris Corp., chief executive of
LucasArts Entertainment and Crystal Dynamics _ and has been
increasingly dismayed by the focus on the getting of money at any
personal cost. His book is a ``stop the madness'' cry from someone
who has not only seen how the sausage is made, but has stuffed a
few casings himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving toward the toxic extreme of capitalism,'' Komisar
said in an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalism works better than any other market structure that has
been devised, he added, because it harnesses man's ``absolute base
instincts _ greed and aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   But a focus on money, to the exclusion of substance and human
relationships, he said, will ultimately fail, perhaps
spectacularly.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the ``digital
divide,'' which lately has been given a lot of lip service but not
much else, does not involve only the issue of which people have
computers and which people do not. It also has to do with the
attitude of those who hit the jackpot in our new casino economy and
who are completely comfortable with pressing their advantage _
behaving with staggering hubris because they believe that merely
having money entitles them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 60s it was all about `wait until the revolution
comes,''' Komisar said. ``Well, guess what? If you take your
billions and flaunt them in front of people who don't have enough
to eat, ultimately you will get your revolution. You can't keep
that toxic edge. It's not sustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are also planting flags for common sense and ethics.
Another book, ``The Cluetrain Manifesto,'' (Perseus Books, 2000)
makes the case, as does Komisar's work, that Internet companies
that ignore the people behind the computers are going to fail.
</P>
<P>
   The manifesto, which states unequivocally that the Internet
changes the way people interact with businesses, profoundly and
forever, has become a best seller. Doc Searls, a longtime marketing
executive who is one of the manifesto's four authors, sees such a
positive response as a source of hope.
</P>
<P>
   The change, he says, is in the balance of power _ from supply to
demand, from the institution to the consumer _ and some investors
are now starting to get the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in the crumbling ivory towers of old Fort Business
are missing the fact that the real action in the marketplace
consists of conversations that people are interested in,'' Searls
says.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, companies will be successful to the degree that they
open up to their customers and unsuccessful to the degree that they
close down. ``You either contribute or you don't,'' he adds.
``That's how conversations work.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For the last couple of months, Doerr, the venture capitalist,
has been redefining success from an even broader perspective. In
public forums, he has been encouraging a shift in focus from
``mercenary'' to ``missionary,'' asking executives to think about
starting companies and building products that they believe will
change the world, rather than merely amassing wealth.
</P>
<P>
   This is not much of a choice: zealotry rarely serves anyone
besides the zealots. But if the metaphor jump-starts people into
thinking about their actions and motivations, the overstatement may
be worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am seeing the first signs of consciousness,'' Komisar said.
``People are engaging in the discussion'' about learning to be
human in the context of what they do for a living. ``There's a bit
more introspection, at least from a significant group of people who
have already made it. They have gone through the process and found
themselves wanting.''
</P>
<P>
   Few have yet gone so far as to reorder their priorities, he
said. ``I'm not expecting a radical change in my lifetime, but we
have to back off from the brink.''

PARTICIPANTS IN GUN-CONTROL DEBATE LOOK AT PATAKI PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ State legislators, gun industry officials and
even many gun control advocates say that the wide-ranging gun
controls proposed this month by Gov. George Pataki, while laudable,
probably would not produce a large reduction in gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's plan would give New York the toughest gun
restrictions in the nation, from requiring trigger locks with new
handguns to instituting a computerized system for tracing bullets
to the guns that fired them. And in interviews, many people who
follow the issue closely praised Pataki, a Republican, saying that
he had confronted a difficult issue head-on, and that his proposals
were worthwhile even if they saved only a handful of lives.
</P>
<P>
   But they also contended that some elements of his plan merely
reinforce existing laws, while others address issues, like assault
weapons, that are relatively minor factors in overall gun violence.
Gun control advocates say the debate highlights the need for
Congress, where Republican leaders have stalled gun control
legislation, to enact national restrictions, a point Pataki has
also made. The governor's power to address the availability of guns
is limited by much looser laws in other states, where most of New
York's illegal guns are first sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each one of the provisions addresses an important policy
consideration,'' Joe Sudbay, political director of Handgun Control,
said of the governor's bill. ``Does it have a major impact on
shootings? It may not.''
</P>
<P>
   State Assemblyman John J. Faso, the Republican minority leader
and one of the governor's closest allies, said: ``Much of what is
being proposed doesn't have a whole lot of relevance when it comes
to preventing gun crimes. I support it, but it's mostly feel-good
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   That view is not universal. ``I think it would have some effect
on violence,'' said Barbara Holt, chairwoman of New Yorkers Against
Gun Violence, though she would not guess how much. ``We would have
liked to see it go farther. But it's a significant step in the
direction of cutting access to guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, a Long Island Democrat, said, ``This has
the opportunity of cutting crime down even more.'' McCarthy, who
became a prominent gun control advocate after her husband was
killed and her son wounded in the Long Island Rail Road shooting in
1993, said she was ``extremely proud'' of Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in law enforcement say the governor is right on,'' said
Katherine N. Lapp, the governor's criminal justice director, though
she would not predict how much the measures might curb gun
violence. ``A lot of these things should be done on a national
basis, but the governor is right to start in New York. These are
the types of things gun control advocates have been calling for
since 1990 or before.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun control groups have called for several measures at the
federal level that are strenuously opposed by the National Rifle
Association and much of the gun industry, like a national system of
licensing and registration and limits on the number of guns people
can buy.
</P>
<P>
   Sudbay said that the symbolic and political implications of
Pataki's proposal might be greater than its crime-fighting effects.
``Governor Pataki taking these kinds of steps gives impetus to
national legislation, because he's a Republican and New York's a
major state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican majority in the state Senate has hesitated to
embrace the governor's proposals, as the Assembly's Democratic
majority has done, but legislators in both parties agree that it is
all but certain that the Legislature will approve Pataki's plan, or
something close to it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Here, then, are the five points of the governor's plan, and the
arguments surrounding them:
</P>
<P>
   Ballistic Fingerprinting
</P>
<P>
   This is the most innovative part of the governor's package, and
perhaps the most promising, law enforcement officials and gun
control advocates say. It would require manufacturers to test-fire
new handguns before they are sold in New York. The spent bullet and
shell casing would be sent to the state police, who would record
the pattern of nicks and scratches on them, a pattern unique to
each gun.
</P>
<P>
   The markings would be entered into a state computer database.
Ideally, when investigators find a bullet or shell casing at a
crime scene, they would feed its characteristics into the computer,
which would tell them in seconds of any possible match to a gun. No
such system exists anywhere, though the federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms is working to create one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be an extremely powerful tool,'' said David
Harper, program manager for the bureau's effort.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert T. Delfay, president of the National Shooting Sports
Foundation, a gun industry group, said such a system ``would not be
of any great use.'' The markings change slightly each time a gun is
fired, he said, and after enough rounds _ it would vary widely,
depending on the type of gun _ making a match would be impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Harper said, however, that even after extensive firing the marks
were consistent enough, particularly on shell casings, to supply
valuable leads. In any case, law enforcement officials say, most
criminals fire their guns too infrequently to change the markings _
after all, they do not want to draw attention to their gun
ownership. They also point to a federal government study showing
that the average gun used in a crime is fairly new, less than three
years old.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics say a gun's markings can be altered by inserting a
cleaning rod into the barrel roughly, but criminal justice experts
say that the great majority of criminals do not go to such lengths
in covering their tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Trigger Locks
</P>
<P>
   Pataki would require that every handgun sold in New York be sold
with a device that locks the trigger in place and can be removed
only with a key or by using a combination.
</P>
<P>
   Major manufacturers already include trigger locks with most new
handguns sold _ the industry says it is more than 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The trigger lock requirement ``is a relatively ineffective law
for purposes of protecting people from gunshot wounds,'' said
Stephen P. Teret, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun
Policy and Research. ``We know that even safety-minded owners often
will not use them.''
</P>
<P>
   Teret, who favors gun control, added that, ``Putting a trigger
lock on or taking a trigger lock off of a loaded gun can cause the
gun to discharge, which creates a new safety issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But Holt disagreed. Requiring locks would ``start people
thinking about gun safety,'' she said. ``There's an educational
component to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some trigger locks are cheaply made and can be pried off, and
Pataki's bill does not specify what kinds would be acceptable. Lapp
said, ``We are looking to have something which would give
standards, give guidance as to what types of trigger locks would be
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   More effective still, advocates say, would be a law requiring
safe storage of a gun, either with a trigger lock or in a locked
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Assault Weapons
</P>
<P>
   The governor's bill would ban the sale and possession of new
assault weapons, defined as guns with detachable external
magazines, along with a few other features.
</P>
<P>
   Critics like Delfay are quick to point out that such guns are
already banned under a federal law enacted in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of a state ban say that it would give local
prosecutors a valuable tool, allowing them to charge people in
state courts, rather than referring the cases to federal
prosecutors, who are often overloaded.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state studies show that of all crimes committed with
guns, fewer than 1 percent involve assault weapons. But, Lapp said,
``when they are used, they can hurt many, many more people than a
handgun.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun Show
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires licensed gun dealers to conduct background
checks on prospective handgun buyers. But the law does not cover
the private citizens who account for many of the sales at gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's proposal would require background checks at gun shows,
even if the seller is a private citizen. The governor took a step
in that direction last year, ordering background checks on all
buyers at guns shows held on state property.
</P>
<P>
   State law already requires that before buying a handgun, a
person must get a state permit, which means a six-month wait and a
background check. (Only 12 states have such a requirement.) The
permit includes the owner's picture and thumb print, and lists, by
serial number, all the handguns the person owns.
</P>
<P>
   Delfay acknowledged that ``the gun show loophole is a real
issue.'' But in New York, he said, because of existing state laws,
``it's a loophole that doesn't have much of an impact on gun
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Many law enforcement officials disagree, asserting that
requiring background checks at gun shows would eliminate a major
source of illegal firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Age Limit
</P>
<P>
   The governor would require that a person be at least 21, rather
than 18, to get a permit and legally buy a handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law already provides that licensed dealers must require
handgun buyers to be 21 or older, though people as young as 18 may
buy handguns from private sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials say that most gun owners under 21,
like the vast majority of criminals, own their guns illegally, and
so would be unaffected by an age limit. State officials say they do
not know how many permits are issued to people under 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like all the other proposals, it's a fine idea to say you have
to be 21,'' Teret said. ``I'm just not sure it will change things
much.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lapp said there was a psychological component to the
proposal. ``I draw the analogy to drinking,'' she said. ``Minors
are told that alcohol is a dangerous substance, and you have to be
21 to imbibe it legally. Does that mean that no minor drinks? No.
But we need to send a message that it's dangerous, just as we do
with guns.''

 &HT;    System's color doesn't erase suspicions of some blacks
 &HT;    By John Head
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin claims he's living the
nightmare portrait he painted with fiery words so many times when
he was the radical known as H. Rap Brown. He says he is a black man
in the clutches of a racist system that is out to destroy him.
</P>
<P>
   But there's something wrong with this picture. The predominant
colors are not the stark blacks and whites of H. Rap Brown's 1960s
tableau, with black for the innocent victims and white for the
oppressors. The case against Al-Amin is a legal landscape drawn
mostly in black.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the accused, Al-Amin is black. But so are his alleged
victims _ Fulton County sheriff's deputies Ricky Kinchen, who was
shot to death, and Aldranon English, who was wounded, allegedly as
they attempted to arrest Al-Amin on a Cobb County warrant accusing
him of receiving stolen property and impersonating a police
officer.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's department is headed by a black woman. So is the
Atlanta police department that searched for Al-Amin after the
shooting. The prosecutor who will decide whether to seek the death
penalty against Al-Amin is black. If the case goes to trial in
Fulton County, odds are that a majority black jury will decide his
guilt or innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin's apparent defense _ uttered to a reporter _ is that the
case against him is ``a government conspiracy.'' J.L. Chestnut, the
attorney who is fighting Al-Amin's extradition from Alabama where
he was captured Monday night, expanded on that theme when he said
his client ``will not be the first or the last black man framed by
the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Having blacks in all those key roles in the legal system argues
against a racially motivated conspiracy. Yet the claim resonates
with some in the African-American community, a community where
those who worked for black political empowerment _ as H. Rap Brown
did with the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee in the
early 1960s _ believed they were creating an antidote to the
system's racism.
</P>
<P>
   In the days following the shootings, reporters found reactions
ranging from refusals to say anything against Al-Amin to strong
statements of support for him in Atlanta's West End neighborhood.
Al-Amin moved there in the 1970s following his release from an
armed robbery sentence in a New York prison, where he converted to
Islam and changed his name. He became the imam, or leader, of the
neighborhood mosque and was credited by some residents with ridding
the area of drug dealers and prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a midday crowd at the West End Barber Shop was asked
what was being said there about the shooting. The barbers were
young men in their 20s; so was their clientele _ some of them, no
doubt, students from the nearby Atlanta University Center campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people thinks it's a setup,'' said one barber, who
refused to give his name.
</P>
<P>
   Others chimed in in agreement, but declined to be quoted. Then a
customer waiting his turn in the chair spoke up. ``I think it's
unfortunate,'' he said. ``A lot of it is not making sense, as far
as the charges against him.''
</P>
<P>
   He was asked his name. ``Serge,'' he said. And last name? ``I'll
refrain from giving that,'' he said, ``because (the police) might
stop me one day and want to get back at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Serge said he finds it hard to believe the deputies did nothing
to provoke the shooting, that they were simply the victims of an
``ambush'' as described by Sheriff Jackie Barrett. ``The level of
disrespect the cops show to the black community is appalling,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   What about the fact that the two officers themselves were black?
</P>
<P>
   ``I really am sorry for the family that has lost their loved
one,'' Serge said. ``But a part of me really is not mad at
(Al-Amin) because of the way the cops are, the way they act. I
don't mean to glorify a cop killer, or anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The police are simply out of control, Serge argued. He mentioned
the Diallo case, in which four New York police officers fired 41
shots at an unarmed man, killing him. And in West End, he claimed,
police recently mistakenly kicked in the door of a 90-year-old man
and didn't even offer an apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, as a black man,'' Serge concluded, ``I'm nervous
myself. The cops could stop me for no reason. When it's a black
person involved, we're guilty until proven innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   GAINS HAVEN'T CHANGED ATTITUDES
</P>
<P>
   Such attitudes have not been eliminated by civil rights advances
that put more African-Americans in positions of power, according to
Charles E. Jones, chairman of the Department of African-American
Studies at Georgia State University. ``One problem is that people
thought that just because you put black people in office you will
have have a more responsive system,'' he said. ``Clearly that has
not always been the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said there is sympathy in the black community for the
slain and wounded deputies. He noted that local black leaders in
the Muslim community offered public condolences to the officers'
families and that trust funds have been set up to help the
families. But the color of the officers' skin does not allay black
suspicion of the police, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized that he has no knowledge of or opinion on the
validity of the allegation that Al-Amin is the victim of a
government conspiracy. But he understands why that claim might play
well in the black community. ``There is still a distrust of the
criminal justice system emanating from the black community,'' Jones
said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, political advances have allowed
African-Americans to overcome a lot, but not all of their
deep-seated suspicions and once-well-founded fears of government
power.
</P>
<P>
   Jones also blames the media for creating doubt about the case
against Al-Amin. He accuses the press of ``sensationalizing'' the
story by harping on Al-Amin's connection to the Black Panther
Party. Jones, who has made the Black Panthers his academic
specialty and who edited the book ``The Black Panther Party
Reconsidered,'' says the former H. Rap Brown's connection to the
Panthers was tenuous at best, with only five months of membership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen the media repeatedly attempt to tie him to the
party, while we have not seen an exploration of why this incident
might have happened,'' Jones said. ``And we have not heard much at
all about the discrepancies in the case, such as that there was a
trail of blood away from the scene but (Al-Amin) had no wound when
he was arrested, or why he would just start shooting when the
arrest warrant was for minor charges.''
</P>
<P>
   BOLSTERING COMMUNITY SUPPORT
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Jones argues, the portrayal of Al-Amin as a former
black radical is more likely to bolster his support in the black
community than to lessen it. ``Some former members of the Black
Panther Party are held in high regard,'' he said. ``They've been
elected to public office. They're still respected. Part of the
support for Al-Amin is the result of the credibility he accumulated
during the 1960s.'' For example, former Panther Bobby Rush is
seeking his fifth term in Congress from Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker knows what it's like to
be a black official prosecuting a criminal case weighted with the
history of a black icon. Last year, he brought fraud charges
against Ralph David Abernathy III, a former state senator and the
son of the late Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr.'s closest aide and his successor as head of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference. Supporters of Abernathy accused
Baker of being part of a racist plot to get him. Baker was asked
this week if, as a black elected official, he was bothered by such
a charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, `` he said, ``because I know it isn't true. I don't think
we can allow ourselves to be distracted from carrying out our duty
under the law ... The cardinal rule is that in every case, whether
it's a high-profile case or it's somebody no one has ever heard of,
you have to treat it like every other case. I believe the vast
majority of people, including in the African-American community,
understand and support that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite strong evidence that included tape recordings of
the defendant virtually admitting to the crimes, it took Baker two
trials to convict Abernathy.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard, who is
black, will have a similarly tough time trying Al-Amin is yet to be
seen. But, if GSU's Jones and others are right, having a case
involving black victims, investigated by black police officers,
prosecuted by black DAs, presided over by a black judge and decided
by a majority black jury won't be enough to convince some
African-Americans that a black defendant won't be railroaded.

POOLS VIP'S CAN SPLASH IN, EVEN GADHAFI'S CAMELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ When Ethem Erkoc decided to go into the
swimming pool business nearly 15 years ago, he had no idea that he
would one day be known as pool-maker to tyrants. It just turned out
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm nowhere near the biggest, but I'm at the top end,'' Erkoc
said at his cramped Istanbul office, which is decorated with photos
of pools he has built around the world. ``I use the newest
technology and engineering concepts, which naturally makes my pools
expensive. My clients have to be people who want the best and can
pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Erkoc said it is not true that he recently built a pool for the
headquarters of Russia's spy agency in Moscow. ``That one was for a
social club that I understand is used by KGB officers,'' he
averred, ``not for the KGB itself.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true, however, that he built a pool in Baghdad for the
Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein. His most faithful client is the
Libyan strongman, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, for whom he has built four
pools and who has ordered six more.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he assembled such an unusual client list, Erkoc
(pronounced air-KOTCH) said he assumes that authoritarian leaders
chat about things like swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's not an official club, but they communicate,'' he
said. ``When they get together, one might say to the other, `Nice
pool, who built it for you?' Ego is involved. When guys like this
see something that's better than what they have, they want one,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Erkoc, 43, discovered the pool business almost by accident.
After earning university degrees in engineering and management, he
started in the plumbing business but found it unrewarding. He had
been a competitive swimmer as a student, and when a swimming club
to which he belonged asked him to find a contractor to build a new
pool, he was surprised at what he found.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very new industry in Turkey, and no one was doing
it well,'' he said. ``I started doing research and realized that
this could be a great new challenge for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Until a generation ago, people in Istanbul and surrounding areas
swam regularly in the Bosporus and adjacent Sea of Marmara. By the
1980s, however, those bodies of water had become polluted and
unappealing.
</P>
<P>
   This was also a period of spectacular economic growth in Turkey.
As the newly rich traveled abroad and saw swimming pools, they came
to want their own. Tourism was also booming, creating a demand for
pools at new hotels and resorts.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of the 300 pools Erkoc has built are in Turkey _ a
few in private homes, others in housing complexes and many more in
sport clubs. ``We're very happy with what we have,'' said Adnan
Demir, director of a club near Istanbul where Erkoc recently built
a pool. ``It sure was expensive, but we knew it was going to be the
best. The water is almost as pure as drinking water, because the
pool is made with special techniques that work against bacteria.
Kids can go home without even taking a shower.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pool even has water-massage features, so if you don't want
to train seriously you can come here just to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   This pool and the club around which it was built cost Demir's
club $1 million, of which about $185,000 went to Erkoc's company.
</P>
<P>
   Erkoc's biggest client in Turkey these days is the army. He is
building three pools at a new military training complex in Ankara.
One is Olympic-size, another is nearly 40 feet deep and designed
for training scuba divers, and the third has the capacity to
simulate rough waves and other adverse conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This company is very interesting and unusual,'' said Mehmet
Bilen, editor of Havuz, the journal of the Turkish pool industry.
``Buying one of their pools is like buying a Jaguar. Every one is
very special and beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ordering a pool is risky because you can have all kinds of
problems from leakage to bad hygiene. Ethem sells to people who
don't want any problems, so they go for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Erkoc is also one of many Turkish entrepreneurs who have cashed
in on the huge business opportunities that came with the breakup of
the Soviet Union and the growth of private business in its former
republics.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the last decade, Turkish companies have been hard at
work in these countries. The main supermarket chain in Azerbaijan,
for example, is Turkish-owned. A Turkish company built the new
international airport in Turkmenistan. Others built hotels in the
capitals of both Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, the government of newly unified Germany
offered Russia a multibillion-dollar package of incentives to
withdraw its troops from what had been East Germany. Part of that
money was used to build living complexes for returning officers,
who wanted their complexes to have pools.
</P>
<P>
   Erkoc won first one contract and then another. He wound up
building no fewer than 50 pools in Russia and Ukraine with German
subsidies, by far his largest project.
</P>
<P>
   One of Erkoc's pools was ordered by Chevron for a complex it has
built for workers at the remote Tengiz oilfield in western
Kazakhstan. Another, filled with luxury features, is in the
Siberian capital, Tyumen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for the top 20 people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Which top 20? ``The top 20 in the state or the mafia or whatever
you want to call it.'' He shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly Erkoc's quirkiest client is Gadhafi, the Libyan
leader, who reportedly allows favored camels to bathe in his pools.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to come and inspect the pools while we were building
them, but I never saw him,'' Erkoc recalled. ``When he was
arriving, the soldiers would shout an order, and we had to drop
everything we were doing and run away immediately. You aren't even
allowed to look back. The first time it happened, I got really
angry, but the six more pools he's ordered should pay for the
humiliation.''
</P>
<P>
   During one of his visits to Libya, Erkoc met a German contractor
who had been warned that he would not be allowed to leave the
country if his project was not judged satisfactory. After that,
Erkoc decided not to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantage of a company like mine is that we're small and
willing to take risks,'' he said. ``But I'm at the point now where
there are some risks I don't want to take. I send representatives
instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the volatile reputations of some of his clients,
Erkoc demands full payment in advance.
</P>

   ``The only time I lost money was with Mubarak,'' he said,
referring to President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. ``He wanted a pool,

<P>
   KABUMBA, Uganda _ Meeting Joseph Kibwetere for the first time,
the three women told him that he had been anointed to help them
spread the word of God, that the Virgin Mary had led them to him, a
Roman Catholic known among many Ugandans for his piety, prayer and
good works.
</P>
<P>
   To hear Kibwetere's relatives tell the tale, that meeting in
1989 was the start of a fateful chain of events that led to
estrangement from their father and husband, his clash with the
Roman Catholic Church, eventual excommunication and, on March 17,
the death of at least 330 followers of his cult in a conflagration
that engulfed their secluded mountain church at Kanungu.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the inferno was a mass suicide _ the second-largest
after Jim Jones led 912 followers to their deaths in Guyana in 1978
_ or a mass murder is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The Ugandan police, understaffed and underequipped, are leaning
to the latter theory, particularly since they unearthed 159 more
bodies this past week. Six were buried in a latrine beside the
burned-out church, and 153 others, including 59 children, at a cult
compound some 30 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday the police said they were searching for more bodies after
finding at least one at a house that belonged to another leader of
the cult.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the truth behind these grisly spectacles, this
impoverished, mostly Christian nation of 11 million faces many
questions: about the importance of religious freedom in a country
where many cults have flourished, about the competence of the
government's security and intelligence network, about Kibwetere's
mysterious Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of
God and, of course, about the man at its center.
</P>
<P>
   Like so much else, the fate of Joseph Kibwetere remains a
puzzle. No one knows if he was among the dead in the scorched
chapel or if he absconded before or during the fire.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the police are assuming that he and perhaps some of the
cult's other leaders are alive, which makes him a murder suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Dead or alive, Kibwetere is, to his eldest son, a murderer. ``I
feel pity for those people who died,'' the son, Juvenar Rugambwa,
36, said at the family's home here. ``In fact, I hate my father. If
he has escaped and I meet him, I wouldn't hesitate killing him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rugambwa and his mother, Theresa, who bore Kibwetere 16 children
during 40 years of marriage, said the man they had known for
decades as a pious Catholic devoted to good works started to change
drastically after three women approached him at a service one day
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The three women _ Credonia Mwerinde, Ursula Komuhangi and Angela
Mugisha _ were already leaders of a Christian cult devoted to the
Virgin Mary, who, they said, had instructed him to take them in.
</P>
<P>
   And so he did, and so began the cult, the family said.
Predicting that the world would end with 1999, the cult crusaded
for a return to a life according to the Ten Commandments, saying
they were the only path to salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1932 in this region, Joseph Kibwetere came up through
the local Catholic school and, contemporaries say, clung to his
faith as the rudder that would lead him and those around him down
the righteous path. He became a schoolteacher and ended up back at
his own primary school, where he impressed his students with his
devotion to his faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a godly man,'' said Matthias Igusha, a student at
Kibwetere's school in the early 1960s. ``You could tell by his
practice: going to church, tending to the sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Kibwetere's wealth and stature grew, as did his dedication to
the church. He became a supervisor for the region's Catholic
schools and founded a private Catholic school of his own. Some
years later, after moving into government service and politics, he
donated the land on which two local Catholic churches are built.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never fought,'' recalled his wife, also a teacher, whom he
married in 1960. ``We had no quarrels in our home. He was a
peaceful man.''
</P>
<P>
   The room in which she talked bore the marks of religious
devotion: images of Jesus and Mary, rosary beads and prayer cards,
a photograph of her husband praying on a pilgrimage to Rome and a
certificate recognizing the special papal blessing that he received
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew up in a lovely home, a lovely family, until he brought
those people home,'' said their son, a contractor and father of
four children.
</P>
<P>
   When the three strange women first appeared, Kibwetere at first
joined in their activities. But as more and more followers came to
live on the family's farm, tensions grew between the 200 or so
followers and the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the people came here they started mistreating us, the
family members, the children and the mother, saying the Virgin Mary
had told them to do things, to keep us without food and to punish
us,'' Rugambwa recalled.
</P>
<P>
   So he fought back, first on his own, later with the support of
his mother and his siblings, against the people who he said had
made him feel like a prisoner in his own home.
</P>
<P>
   The family won. In 1992 the cult and its leader packed up and
left for Kanungu. Kibwetere never moved back, despite his family's
invitation to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Settled on a magnificent plot of fertile hillside land, the cult
set about spreading its message, chiefly through a 163-page
manifesto, ``A Timely Message From Heaven: The End of the Present
Times.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the book is devoted to the revelations that Kibwetere
and other cult leaders said they had received. The volume contains
dark prophecies of famines and wars, of rivers turning to blood and
of food turning to poison. It enumerates the problems that will be
visited on particular countries: ``Mozambique will be destroyed by
its own machinery,'' and ``Japan will have rain falling for as long
as my father wants.''
</P>
<P>
   With Kibwetere as chief proselytizer, the cult took hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man was prominent in many ways,'' his son said, pointing
out his father's service on government commissions and his role as
an organizer for the opposition Democratic Party. ``People
respected him because he was religious and he had money. When you
have money, you are respected and liked. And he had a convincing
tongue. He was bright. He was educated.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But in the eyes of the church, Kibwetere had become a sinner of
the worst kind, claiming to have contact with God himself and
refusing the orders of an old friend, Bishop John Baptist Kakubi,
to desist.
</P>
<P>
   Florence Igusha, who came to know Kibwetere through her husband,
is thankful for the bishop's admonitions. ``I think if the bishop
had not stopped us, I think most of us would have joined him,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The church's anger grew when he recruited two priests to his
cause, and eventually Kibwetere was excommunicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``In effect he challenged the leadership of the pope,'' the now
retired Bishop Kakubi told the official government newspaper, New
Vision.
</P>
<P>
   The cult's ranks swelled, with estimates of its peak membership
ranging from 1,000 to 4,000. To join, people were expected to sell
off their possessions and turn over the considerable sums of money,
say many relatives of those who perished at Kanungu.
</P>
<P>
   On the compound an ascetic lifestyle took hold, with sex even
among married couples discouraged and communication limited largely
to a system of sign language in which they were instructed, the
relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what happened when the world did not end on Dec. 31,
1999 is not clear. What is known is that dozens of followers
converged on the Kanungu compound on March 16 and 17, joining
hundreds already there.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of March 17 the flock gathered in the chapel,
which faced Rugyeyo Mountain. One blaze, or maybe several, were
ignited.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:45 p.m. the police station at Rukungiri, the headquarters
for the area, received a radio call, the deputy commander, Stephen
Musoke, said last week. The call was from an officer in Kambuga, a
couple of villages from Kanungu and the nearest one with a police
post. There had been a fire at the headquarters of the Kibwetere
group, the officer reported, and there were people dead.
</P>
<P>
   Only as villagers and police officers descended on the
smoldering building did the scale become apparent. The remains of
hundreds of people, mostly their bones and in some cases only their
ashes, lay massed at one end of the chapel. Virtually no one could
be positively identified, and by Monday night they had all been
buried together in a grave alongside their wrecked house of
worship.
</P>
<P>
   The day before the fire, a parcel from Kanungu arrived at the
home of Kibwetere's family. It contained books and documents from
the cult, its certificate of registration, a copy of the 10
commandments of the cult and other items. All was sent, the family
believes, by Joseph Kibwetere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody else would have sent them,'' the son said. ``He wanted
us to carry on the message.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A landmark air-pollution law enacted a decade ago
to reduce acid rain has failed to slow the acidification of lakes
and streams in the Adirondacks, many of which are rapidly losing
the ability to sustain life, according to a new federal report.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the General Accounting Office, a nonpartisan
research agency for Congress, raises sharp questions about the
effectiveness of the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, which set
tough restrictions on smokestack emissions of sulfur and nitrogen,
the two components of acid rain.
</P>
<P>
   The report shows that while sulfur levels have declined
substantially in a vast majority of the Adirondacks waterways,
nitrogen levels have continued to rise in nearly half of them. In
water, nitrogen turns to nitric acid, which can damage fish larvae
and create conditions that poison adult fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increases in these lakes' acidity raise questions about their
prospects for recovering under the current program,'' the report
concludes.
</P>
<P>
   New York officials and environmental groups seized on the report
as clear evidence that the federal government urgently needs to set
even stricter standards for nitrogen emissions, particularly from
upwind coal-burning power plants in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This provides tangible evidence that things have gotten worse
in the area of the country where everyone agreed it was already
bad,'' said Rep. John Sweeney, a Republican who represents much of
the Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York has already taken the lead in reducing power-plant
emissions,'' he said. ``This is a federal issue. There have to be
new nationwide standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney and Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, a Republican from Utica,
N.Y., and Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan are the lead sponsors of
legislation that would require utility companies to reduce nitrogen
emissions by 50 percent more than the levels required under the
1990 amendments.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation has been bottled up in committees by opponents,
primarily members of Congress from the Midwest. Sweeney and
lobbyists for environmental groups said they thought the accounting
office's report would generate support for reopening debate on the
measure, though they remained pessimistic about its chances of
passage this year.
</P>
<P>
   But officials representing Midwestern utility companies said the
new study was not conclusive enough to warrant additional action by
Congress. While not disputing the science underlying the report's
conclusions, they said it was too early to evaluate the 1990
amendments, parts of which have only recently taken effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nitrogen oxide reductions just started in 1996 and then were
increased in 2000,'' said John Kinsman, manager for atmospheric
science at the Edison Electric Institute, an association of
shareholder-owned electric utilities. ``There will be a lot less
nitrogen oxide emitted from utilities now than there was last year.
And that certainly isn't in the data being analyzed.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some acid-rain experts who support the report's scientific
conclusions questioned whether simply reducing emissions from
coal-burning power plants would be sufficient to solve the problems
in the Adirondacks, since over a third of the nitrogen in the
atmosphere comes from automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an expectation that if you reduce nitrogen emissions
from utilities, the acid rain problem in the Adirondacks will get
better,'' said Charles T. Driscoll, a professor of civil and
environmental engineering at Syracuse University. ``And that is
probably an unrealistic expectation. You probably wouldn't even see
a change from the Moynihan bill. It will probably take a much more
comprehensive approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Acid precipitation occurs when sulfur or nitrogen borne on the
prevailing winds mixes with atmospheric moisture to form sulfuric
or nitric acid, falling earthward as acid rain, snow or fog. Dry
nitrogen and sulfur pollution also turns to acid when deposited in
waterways or mixed with moisture in the soil.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office study, which will be released to
the public on Monday, was requested by Sweeney and Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt.
</P>
<P>
   The study is being released at a time when a bipartisan parade
of officials from New York and other northeastern states have been
scrambling to show that they are concerned about acid rain.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer of New York, a
Democrat, announced that he planned to sue 17 power plants, mainly
in the Midwest and the Virginias, to force them to reduce emissions
that cause smog and acid rain.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Gov. George Pataki of New York, a Republican,
said he would order power plants in New York to greatly reduce
smokestack emissions. And in November, Attorney General Richard
Blumenthal of Connecticut, a Republican, said he would follow
Spitzer's lead in suing 16 coal-burning power plants.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting office's report does not break new scientific
ground, but instead brings together the findings of many recent
scientific studies in a highly readable form. It also offers
gloomier predictions than many other recent scientific surveys,
suggesting that the situation in the Adirondacks seems to be
deteriorating faster than scientists with the federal Environmental
Protection Agency had thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``It basically says that more lakes are dying faster,'' said
John Sheehan, a spokesman for the Adirondack Council, a nonprofit
environmental group. ``Their worst-case scenario was optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous studies have determined that high acidity has been
killing fish in Adirondack waterways for many years.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the nitrogen deposited in the
Adirondacks during the 1990s remained relatively stable. But in
that same period, the level of nitrogen rose in 48 percent of the
52 Adirondack lakes that are routinely tested for acid levels by
Adirondack Lakes Survey Corp., a nonprofit group. Nitrogen levels
declined in only a quarter of the lakes, and remained level in the
rest. By comparison, sulfur levels declined in 92 percent of the
same lakes.
</P>
<P>
   The report offers two reasons that nitrogen levels have
continued to rise in the waterways. First, forests can absorb some
nitrogen, which is a nutrient for trees and other plants. But older
forests, like those in the Adirondacks, tend to absorb less,
allowing nitrogen in the soil to leach into nearby ponds, lakes and
streams.
</P>
<P>
   Second, soils often contain elements that neutralize acid
precipitation. But the Adirondacks have been inundated by acid rain
for so long that those neutralizing elements have been depleted in
many places, the report concludes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like wet sponges that no longer can soak up water, parts of the
Adirondacks are becoming saturated with nitrogen and thus incapable
of buffering waterways from acid precipitation, the report
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lakes in the Adirondack Mountains are taking longer to recover
than lakes located elsewhere and are likely to recover less or not
recover, without further reductions of acid deposition,'' the
report says.
</P>
<P>
   Several experts on acid rain said they agreed with the report's
overall conclusions about the potentially devastating impact of
rising nitrogen levels in the region's waterways. But they raised
questions about the causes of those rising levels and the ways to
reduce them.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Lovett, a plant ecologist with the Institute of Ecosystem
Studies, a private nonprofit research organization in Millbrook,
N.Y., said changes in climate or vegetation growth could also
affect nitrogen levels. A drought, for instance, could reduce
nitrogen absorption years later, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while he supports reducing nitrogen emissions from
industrial smokestacks, he said the problem could not be solved
until something was also done about the nitrogen in automobile
exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effort has been focused on smokestacks because it is
easier to control,'' he said. ``But we can't point our finger
entirely at the Midwest when we are driving around in our cars here
in the East.''

 &HT;    2 wives, money woes for Al-Amin
 &HT;    By Dan Chapman and Andrea Jones
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The ramshackle house where Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin's
wife lives is within a stone's throw of the grocery store and coin
laundry he used to own in Atlanta's historic West End.
</P>
<P>
   It's a neighborhood quite different from the upscale,
suburbanlike Flamingo Drive, three miles to the west, where Al-Amin
also owns a home _ a 5,100-square-foot beauty on 3-plus acres.
</P>
<P>
   That's where his other wife lives, according to Milton D. Jones,
an attorney who represented Al-Amin in bankruptcy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The multiple marriages are additional pieces in the mysterious
puzzle that is Al-Amin, who was arrested last week in the slaying
of a Fulton County sheriff's deputy and the wounding of another.
</P>
<P>
   Three times since 1998, Al-Amin has filed for protection from
creditors who are demanding tens of thousands of dollars from him.
</P>
<P>
   A Fulton County judge labeled Al-Amin's latest petition ``an
abusive filing'' not undertaken in ``good faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the financial and criminal troubles, the 56-year-old
Al-Amin still commands respect among his Muslim brethren.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish to remind everyone of Imam Jamil Al-Amin's
longstanding role as a community leader who had a positive impact
on the lives of so many people,'' the Council on American-Islamic
Relations said in a statement issued last week. ``The charges
against Imam Jamil are especially troubling because they are
inconsistent with what is known of his moral character and past
behavior as a Muslim.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin, formerly known as H. Rap Brown, once advocated violence
as the means necessary for African-Americans to get their due in
American society. He moved to Atlanta in 1976 after serving time in
a New York state prison for a robbery and shootout with police.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin embraced Islam while in prison, and afterwards his
lifestyle mellowed in Atlanta. He become an imam, or spiritual
leader. He founded a mosque near Atlanta University Center and
helped clean up the crime-plagued neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, he bought a brick building in the West End and opened a
grocery store and laundromat. (The building changed hands in
October 1999 and is no longer owned by Al-Amin.)
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1985, he bought a clapboard house, a block from the
store. Ten years later, he bought the brick house on Flamingo
Drive, with its green-and-white trim and large magnolia in the
front yard.
</P>
<P>
   The doors were closed and the windows barred Saturday morning at
the laundromat and grocery store. Three children in Muslim garb
strolled past. A man sat on the picnic table across the street,
where Al-Amin would frequently hold court.
</P>
<P>
   The cream-colored house also was silent, its window blinds
pulled tight and piles of leaves in the front yard awaiting pickup.
Weeds and trash filled the vacant lot across the street. This
house, lawyer Jones said, is where one of Al-Amin's wives lives.
</P>
<P>
   The azaleas bloomed pink and white on Flamingo Drive, where
another wife lives, according to Jones. The blinds were pulled
there, too.
</P>
<P>
   Neither wife could be reached for comment. One of them, Karima,
visited Al-Amin in jail Friday in Alabama, where he is being held
pending extradition to Georgia. The other wife's name could not be
learned.
</P>
<P>
   The Koran, Islam's holy book, permits a man to marry up to four
wives, and teaches that a husband must treat all wives fairly and
equally.
</P>
<P>
   Polygamy was approved during the seventh century, when Islam's
prophet Mohammed and his followers endured religious wars that
killed many men, leaving women without husbands.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Muslim Almanac, however, ``polygamy always has
been relatively rare (less than 5 percent).'' It is even rarer in
the United States, where it is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   There are no marriage records on file for Al-Amin in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The nicer of his two homes _ the one on Flamingo Drive _ is at
the root of Al-Amin's financial troubles. Unable to pay the
mortgage on that home, valued at $250,000 _ or on the other
properties, valued at another $160,000 _ Al-Amin filed for
bankruptcy in January 1998. At the time, he was almost $10,000 in
arrears.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern, repeated three times so far, was set: Attorneys
start foreclosure proceedings against Al-Amin only to see him file
for bankruptcy protection, effectively stalling foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Court records show he also owed more than $4,200 in property
taxes. Credit card companies and others demanded $24,542.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin listed monthly income of $7,250. He owned no checking or
savings account, stocks, jewelry, antiques, art objects or
computers, according to the bankruptcy petition, although he
claimed a 1987 Toyota 4Runner, valued at $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   The petition was thrown out after the judge agreed with the
bankruptcy trustee that Al-Amin had failed to list the assets in
the grocery store and laundromat.
</P>
<P>
   ``All household income and expenses must be disclosed,'' wrote
trustee James H. Bone. ``This includes debtor and his two (2)
wives.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin refiled for bankruptcy in May 1998. This time, he pegged
the value of the laundromat's washers and dryers at $5,000. Jones
said it was his oversight that the machines _ and Al-Amin's wives _
were left out of the first petition.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the petition repeated earlier financial
disclosures, Al-Amin's monthly earnings had risen to $9,000. He
added $1,750 for money made from lectures.
</P>
<P>
   Creditors and Bone, the trustee, again objected to any deal, and
attorneys again began foreclosure proceedings against the Flamingo
Drive home. Al-Amin was $8,041 in arrears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The present case is another repetitive, bad faith filing,''
the attorneys wrote in seeking dismissal of the protection plan.
</P>
<P>
   The judge dismissed the case when Al-Amin came up with a plan to
pay $46,953.
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest creditors was paid $5,727, but then the
monthly payments stopped. The firm again tried to foreclose.
Al-Amin again filed for bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   Gady Zeewy, who represented the creditor, said Saturday that
Al-Amin would file for bankruptcy as ``a stall tactic'' and that
creditors were being ``strung along as long as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The third and, so far, final round of bankruptcy protection was
dismissed last March. The judge ruled that Al-Amin failed to file
necessary documents and skipped bankruptcy workout meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court concludes that this case was not filed in good
faith,'' the judge wrote, adding that it was an ``abusive filing.''
The judge dismissed the case with prejudice, an extreme measure
that prohibited Al-Amin from refiling for 180 days.

   Again, though, Al-Amin came up with money to pay off some debts.

   ``He came up with a lot of money in a relatively short amount of
time,'' Zeewy said, adding that ``he worked the system for several
years.''

<P>
   KABUMBA, Uganda _ Meeting Joseph Kibwetere for the first time,
the three women told him that he had been anointed to help them
spread the word of God, that the Virgin Mary had led them to him, a
Roman Catholic known among many Ugandans for his piety, prayer and
good works.
</P>
<P>
   To hear Kibwetere's relatives tell the tale, that meeting in
1989 was the start of a fateful chain of events that led to
estrangement from their father and husband, his clash with the
Roman Catholic Church, eventual excommunication and, on March 17,
the death of at least 330 followers of his cult in a conflagration
that engulfed their secluded mountain church at Kanungu.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the inferno was a mass suicide _ the second-largest
after Jim Jones led 912 followers to their deaths in Guyana in 1978
_ or a mass murder is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The Ugandan police, understaffed and underequipped, are leaning
to the latter theory, particularly since they unearthed 159 more
bodies this past week. Six were buried in a latrine beside the
burned-out church, and 153 others, including 59 children, at a cult
compound some 30 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday the police said they were searching for more bodies after
finding at least one at a house that belonged to another leader of
the cult.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the truth behind these grisly spectacles, this
impoverished, mostly Christian nation of 11 million faces many
questions: about the importance of religious freedom in a country
where many cults have flourished, about the competence of the
government's security and intelligence network, about Kibwetere's
mysterious Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of
God and, of course, about the man at its center.
</P>
<P>
   Like so much else, the fate of Joseph Kibwetere remains a
puzzle. No one knows if he was among the dead in the scorched
chapel or if he absconded before or during the fire.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the police are assuming that he and perhaps some of the
cult's other leaders are alive, which makes him a murder suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Dead or alive, Kibwetere is, to his eldest son, a murderer. ``I
feel pity for those people who died,'' the son, Juvenar Rugambwa,
36, said at the family's home here. ``In fact, I hate my father. If
he has escaped and I meet him, I wouldn't hesitate killing him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rugambwa and his mother, Theresa, who bore Kibwetere 16 children
during 40 years of marriage, said the man they had known for
decades as a pious Catholic devoted to good works started to change
drastically after three women approached him at a service one day
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The three women _ Credonia Mwerinde, Ursula Komuhangi and Angela
Mugisha _ were already leaders of a Christian cult devoted to the
Virgin Mary, who, they said, had instructed him to take them in.
</P>
<P>
   And so he did, and so began the cult, the family said.
Predicting that the world would end with 1999, the cult crusaded
for a return to a life according to the Ten Commandments, saying
they were the only path to salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1932 in this region, Joseph Kibwetere came up through
the local Catholic school and, contemporaries say, clung to his
faith as the rudder that would lead him and those around him down
the righteous path. He became a schoolteacher and ended up back at
his own primary school, where he impressed his students with his
devotion to his faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a godly man,'' said Matthias Igusha, a student at
Kibwetere's school in the early 1960s. ``You could tell by his
practice: going to church, tending to the sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Kibwetere's wealth and stature grew, as did his dedication to
the church. He became a supervisor for the region's Catholic
schools and founded a private Catholic school of his own. Some
years later, after moving into government service and politics, he
donated the land on which two local Catholic churches are built.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never fought,'' recalled his wife, also a teacher, whom he
married in 1960. ``We had no quarrels in our home. He was a
peaceful man.''
</P>
<P>
   The room in which she talked bore the marks of religious
devotion: images of Jesus and Mary, rosary beads and prayer cards,
a photograph of her husband praying on a pilgrimage to Rome and a
certificate recognizing the special papal blessing that he received
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew up in a lovely home, a lovely family, until he brought
those people home,'' said their son, a contractor and father of
four children.
</P>
<P>
   When the three strange women first appeared, Kibwetere at first
joined in their activities. But as more and more followers came to
live on the family's farm, tensions grew between the 200 or so
followers and the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the people came here they started mistreating us, the
family members, the children and the mother, saying the Virgin Mary
had told them to do things, to keep us without food and to punish
us,'' Rugambwa recalled.
</P>
<P>
   So he fought back, first on his own, later with the support of
his mother and his siblings, against the people who he said had
made him feel like a prisoner in his own home.
</P>
<P>
   The family won. In 1992 the cult and its leader packed up and
left for Kanungu. Kibwetere never moved back, despite his family's
invitation to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Settled on a magnificent plot of fertile hillside land, the cult
set about spreading its message, chiefly through a 163-page
manifesto, ``A Timely Message From Heaven: The End of the Present
Times.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the book is devoted to the revelations that Kibwetere
and other cult leaders said they had received. The volume contains
dark prophecies of famines and wars, of rivers turning to blood and
of food turning to poison. It enumerates the problems that will be
visited on particular countries: ``Mozambique will be destroyed by
its own machinery,'' and ``Japan will have rain falling for as long
as my father wants.''
</P>
<P>
   With Kibwetere as chief proselytizer, the cult took hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man was prominent in many ways,'' his son said, pointing
out his father's service on government commissions and his role as
an organizer for the opposition Democratic Party. ``People
respected him because he was religious and he had money. When you
have money, you are respected and liked. And he had a convincing
tongue. He was bright. He was educated.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But in the eyes of the church, Kibwetere had become a sinner of
the worst kind, claiming to have contact with God himself and
refusing the orders of an old friend, Bishop John Baptist Kakubi,
to desist.
</P>
<P>
   Florence Igusha, who came to know Kibwetere through her husband,
is thankful for the bishop's admonitions. ``I think if the bishop
had not stopped us, I think most of us would have joined him,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The church's anger grew when he recruited two priests to his
cause, and eventually Kibwetere was excommunicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``In effect he challenged the leadership of the pope,'' the now
retired Bishop Kakubi told the official government newspaper, New
Vision.
</P>
<P>
   The cult's ranks swelled, with estimates of its peak membership
ranging from 1,000 to 4,000. To join, people were expected to sell
off their possessions and turn over the considerable sums of money,
say many relatives of those who perished at Kanungu.
</P>
<P>
   On the compound an ascetic lifestyle took hold, with sex even
among married couples discouraged and communication limited largely
to a system of sign language in which they were instructed, the
relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what happened when the world did not end on Dec. 31,
1999 is not clear. What is known is that dozens of followers
converged on the Kanungu compound on March 16 and 17, joining
hundreds already there.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of March 17 the flock gathered in the chapel,
which faced Rugyeyo Mountain. One blaze, or maybe several, were
ignited.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:45 p.m. the police station at Rukungiri, the headquarters
for the area, received a radio call, the deputy commander, Stephen
Musoke, said last week. The call was from an officer in Kambuga, a
couple of villages from Kanungu and the nearest one with a police
post. There had been a fire at the headquarters of the Kibwetere
group, the officer reported, and there were people dead.
</P>
<P>
   Only as villagers and police officers descended on the
smoldering building did the scale become apparent. The remains of
hundreds of people, mostly their bones and in some cases only their
ashes, lay massed at one end of the chapel. Virtually no one could
be positively identified, and by Monday night they had all been
buried together in a grave alongside their wrecked house of
worship.
</P>
<P>
   The day before the fire, a parcel from Kanungu arrived at the
home of Kibwetere's family. It contained books and documents from
the cult, its certificate of registration, a copy of the 10
commandments of the cult and other items. All was sent, the family
believes, by Joseph Kibwetere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody else would have sent them,'' the son said. ``He wanted
us to carry on the message.''

COMMENTARY: CAJUN PEACEMAKIN' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the president from James Carville, your greatest loyalist,
Ragin'-Cajun author of ``Stickin''':
</P>
<P>
   Who'd a thunk we could top the pope's tour of Israel and the
Russian election with your summit in Geneva with Syria's Hafez
Assad? He didn't budge, but everyone knows he's a tough nut to
crack, and this way you get credit for any future deal.
</P>
<P>
   Now here's my three-phase plan to elect Hillary and Al, and get
you a legacy with legs. As one who helped elect both you and Ehud
Barak, I speak from global experience.
</P>
<P>
   Phase I: Late this spring we close the deal with Syria. That
means getting Israel off every blinkin' inch of them Golan hills.
In return, Syria hosts an armored brigade of our boys plus the
Frenchies on the front lines forever. Israel gets real-time access
to our spy satellites and a real-warm handshake from ol' Hafez.
</P>
<P>
   I already told Ehud how to sell this to the Israelis in a
referendum in the summer. It's gonna be a financial bonanza: a
couple of billion bucks from this year's U.S. budget supplemental
for starters, and that's double the dough we paid them to go along
with Arafat at Wye. His campaign clincher is your promise of $15
billion more from Al after he's elected.
</P>
<P>
   What's the $17 billion for? Deep defense against the Syrians we
say are not threatening Israel from up on the Golan, of course.
Republican isolationists will say that's a big bundle for moving
one division of troops downtown, but we can denounce those
skinflints for being pro-Mideast-war.
</P>
<P>
   You may have a problem shaking the first $2 billion out of
Congress this summer, because Ehud won't scrap his deal to sell
China Israel's new AWACs, which are better than ours. Brother Jiang
is offering $1 billion for four of those babies, but it kinda rubs
Americans the wrong way for Israel to sell China the means to knock
out the U.S. Navy in the Taiwan Strait. Tell our defense
contractors that Israel will spend a lot of the $17 billion peace
payoff on U.S. equipment; the K Street lobbyists will know what
arms to twist in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Phase II starts a couple of weeks after Labor Day. With the U.S.
campaign heating up, we bring off the Palestinian deal on the White
House lawn. Last year, Ehud set the deadline for final settlement
smack in our election time, which was all my idea.
</P>
<P>
   Photo is Arafat and you and Hillary and Ehud; we'll set it up so
the media can't crop Hillary out. Al stands a step behind Ehud,
nowhere near Yasser Arafat. Then all off to New York for a
ticker-tape peace parade, or whatever they use for confetti these
days.
</P>
<P>
   Phase III comes in October, surprise-time. First event: your
sudden trip to Jerusalem carrying a golden shovel to turn the earth
for the construction of the U.S. embassy there. You've had the
authority from Congress to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to
Israel's capital for years, but you didn't want to upset Yasser.
</P>
<P>
   Now here's an event with the timing totally in your control.
Fill Air Force One with every American Jewish leader, with their
names inscribed on the shovel that will be hung in our ambassador's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat will want you to do the same in Abu Dis, the Jerusalem
suburb he wants to be his new capital, but that can wait until the
election's over.
</P>
<P>
   The second event will take some help from Sandy and Madeleine,
but it's doable. October is the time that the Nobel Peace Prize for
2000 is announced. If we've bought off the Golan settlers enough to
win the referendum, and then sweetened the Palestinian pot enough
for one of those comprehensive whoopdedos, how can those libs in
Norway deny their prize to you?
</P>
<P>
   Not only could you use the million bucks to pay those legal
bills, but the prestige would also back off Starr's replacement,
Robert Ray. You suppose he'd dare to indict the man on his way to
pick up the prize for being the world's peacemaker? I'd personally
make his name mud.
</P>
<P>
   That's my plan. Can't miss electing Hillary and Al, insuring
your legacy and saving you from the clink. By the way _ Assad's
son, Bashar, wants to be the next dictator. If you need a sweetener
to get Syria aboard, you can promise ol' Hafez I'll handle his
son's campaign.

READY-TO-WEAR ACCESS TO THE WEB; INTERNET STRATEGIES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, the MIT Media Lab has experimented with various types
of wearable computing devices.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Charmed Technology, which licenses Media Lab technology,
has been demonstrating wireless Web-access computers that might be
inexpensive enough to be given away, with users paying a service
fee. ``We've been working on this 10 years, and I want to see it
happen,'' said Alex Pentland, head of the lab's academic program
and a technology adviser to the company.
</P>

<P>
   INTERNET STRATEGIES
</P>
<P>
   Given all the e-talk the last two years, one might think big
businesses that have not yet fully implemented an Internet strategy
are at least on their way. A recent survey of 78 big companies
indicates otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the
Conference Board, a business-financed research group, nearly 80
percent of the companies said that Internet business accounted for
less than 5 percent of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Only about a quarter of the companies were able to process
transactions online, and fewer than half had methods in place to
assess e-commerce performance. Just 17 percent rated themselves as
e-commerce innovators.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of Ed Berryman, e-business director for
PricewaterhouseCoopers, the results ``were not entirely
surprising.'' Nearly all of the companies have annual revenue of
over $1 billion, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turning the corner, especially for such large firms, is easier
said than done,'' Berryman added.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the survey indicated that at least some change was under
way. Two-thirds of the companies reported that senior executives
were involved with e-commerce planning and nearly half had
full-time business units devoted to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, e-commerce is a state of mind. ``The strategic
process can't be the traditional annual affair,'' Berryman said.
``They need to have a much more flexible, quickly reactive way of
managing ideas and opportunities. So instead of thinking of
themselves as a battleship that needs to be turned, they may need
to change the shape of the organization into a fleet of cruisers.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies may also need to be willing to spend some money. Even
though most of the companies surveyed indicated that online
procurement was a top priority, only 25 percent said they planned
to invest in it.

PATENTS: AN ONLINE CLASSROOM THAT KEEPS STUDENTS AWAKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The idea of online learning got a lot of attention recently when
Michael J. Saylor, the head of MicroStrategy Inc., announced that
he was putting $100 million toward creating a free, online
university. Even so, much online learning thus far consists of
regular lecture-hall fare repackaged for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But what if an online classroom could feature a computerized
professor who teaches by Socratic method, administers pop quizzes,
sounds an alarm when inattentive scholars snooze during lectures,
and kicks students out of the discussion when they start asking
stupid questions?
</P>
<P>
   Peter Tong and Chi Fai Ho say that they have invented such an
educational system, and that they are acquiring a patent portfolio
that broadly covers their approach to online learning. Last month
they received their 10th such patent, for a system that monitors
and responds to the learning of students in a virtual classroom,
both individually and as a group.
</P>
<P>
   Their learning system is powered in part by an automated
natural-language search engine created by Tong and Ho. They say
their search engine, which is the basis for their company,
ProfessorQ, bears some resemblance to the one powering the popular
AskJeeves reference site.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, two professors from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology received a lot of press recently for suing AskJeeves
over a patent. But they are not the only ones. Tong and Ho last
summer filed a lawsuit in the Northern District of California
against AskJeeves, saying that the company infringed on three of
their search-engine patents.
</P>
<P>
   Tong and Ho contend that their patents cover the Socratic method
_ as long as it is a computer that is asking the questions. This
computer ``allows you to learn through questioning,'' Tong said.
``Based on your answers, the computer knows your level of
understanding _ whether you need to review material or move on.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of an online classroom, Tong said, the computerized
professor also learns from and responds to group dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, if someone is constantly asking irrelevant
questions and disrupting the discussion,'' Tong said, ``the
computer can send a message saying, `Wouldn't it be better if you
were more focused in the subject area?''' And if the irritating
student persists with the nongermane questions? ``The computer can
shut down his communications link,'' Tong said.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the Tong-Ho patents covers software that prevents
students from doing things for fun _ like playing music or games _
on their computers until they have finished a prescribed amount of
homework.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another patent covers the technology that monitors a
student's attentiveness with a video camera, which, while perched
on a computer, is constantly patrolling for drooping eyes and
nodding heads.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, however, Tong said, the computer observes passively _
by noting whether the student's response time to questions is
slower than usual, for example. ``The monitoring part is not
intrusive,'' he said. ``It's not like some systems that monitor
your brain waves, where you have to put gear on your head.''
</P>
<P>
   So what will the computerized professor do if it catches you
slacking?
</P>
<P>
   ``It can yell at you and say, `Wake up!''' Tong said. ``Or it
can suddenly play a piece of music or change the screen display.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tong knows a thing or two about old-fashioned academia. Like Ho,
he has a Ph.D. in computer science from the California Institute of
Technology; he also has a law degree and an MBA. This month the
former product manager at Hewlett-Packard quit his day job as a
patent lawyer so he could devote his full attention to ProfessorQ.
</P>
<P>
   The Tong-Ho prototype of the digital professor is rather
primitive, Tong said, because thus far the two inventors have been
unable to attract much investment capital for the project. In part,
Tong says, this is because he and Ho are ``a couple of
technologists who don't know anything about marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it's an idea ahead of its time, Tong said. ``One can
have great technology, but when one is ahead of the game, people
won't be buying it. We're waiting for the industry to be ready, and
then we'll develop it.'' In the meantime, Tong said, the two are
concentrating their efforts on their search engine.
</P>
<P>
   Tong and Ho were most recently awarded patent 6,029,043.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov. They may be
ordered through the Web site or through the mail, by patent number,
for $3 from the Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, DC 20231.

SPORTS COLUMN: IN BASEBALL, RICH ALWAYS GET RICHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKOROZOWA, Japan _ Halfway around the world, baseball looks
very much the same. The dude who whips his BMW into a narrow
parking space at the players' lot knows he is young and cool and
rich.
</P>
<P>
   Also, just as in North America, people worry about the growing
gap between the rich teams and the poor teams. Before the Mets and
Cubs meet Wednesday and Thursday in the official National League
opening series, they will play two Japanese teams with the deepest
corporate pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday the Mets will play the traditional champion with a
classic uniform and a historic reputation for getting the close
call. We are not talking here about the Yankees but rather the
Yomiuri Giants from Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get the benefit of the doubt against them,''
recalled Leon Lee, now the Cubs' Pacific Rim scout, who had a long
and honorable career in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' opponent Monday afternoon used to be a joke but is now
respected and maybe even resented a bit for the way it keeps buying
new talent. We are not talking here about the contemporary Atlanta
Braves but rather the Seibu Lions who are 25 miles _ that is to
say, nearly two hours _ from downtown Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are competitive, young and flashy,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   By some strange stroke, neither Yomiuri nor Seibu won the
pennant in their respective leagues last year, but they raise the
stakes for the other 10 teams. In this shrinking world of global
networks and fast jets, there is a danger in the emergence of
superteams. In European soccer, the best teams play in a midweek
Champions League that only diminishes the national leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is not there yet, what with the huge barrier of the
Pacific Ocean, but American baseball has come up with interleague
play, with the Yanks getting the Mets and Braves every summer, and
lesser teams are stuck with dog teams.
</P>
<P>
   Some people in Japan fear that Yomiuri and Seibu, by commanding
a top price of $200 a ticket for these exhibitions, are taking away
from the start of the regular season this weekend. Other teams are
ignoring this hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   Sadaharu Oh, who merely hit 868 home runs, more than Henry
Aaron, managed the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks to the Japan Series
championship last fall, but he will not be greeting Sammy Sosa this
week. He is said to be too busy making his charges field grounders
to attend the hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   With and without Oh, the Giants have won 28 pennants in the past
50 years. They are owned by the huge and respected Yomiuri Shimbun
newspaper chain, with its 10.2 million circulation, the largest in
the world, and the only newspaper in the world to sponsor its own
orchestra, the Yomiuri Nippon Symphony Orchestra. Monday's
opponents, the Cubs, are also owned by a newspaper firm, Tribune
Co., which has not helped the Cubs break their gloomy hex.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are clearly the most popular team in Japan.
Sometimes, it used to seem, even with the umpires.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I didn't like was that the umpires seemed to want to
balance everything out,'' said Lee, who batted .308 in 10
fulfilling seasons here. ``I'd see the Giants celebrating, and I'd
think, `Why are they celebrating?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more parity now,'' added Lee, who is everybody's best
friend on this trip because of his familiarity with the language
and the electronics stores.
</P>
<P>
   Parity or not, the Giants have their dome near downtown Tokyo,
with an amusement park and restaurants all around it. Seibu
recently put a dome right over a relatively new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions have come a long way _ from Fukuoka, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were named the Crown Lighter Lions,'' Lee said.
``Everybody who hit a home run would get a free lighter, whether
you smoked or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lighters were extinguished when they were purchased by
Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, one of four brothers who run the far-flung Seibu
dynasty. Tsutsumi relocated the franchise to this distant suburb,
reachable mainly by Seibu Railways from the basement of _ oh, but
you guessed it _ the Seibu department store on the north side of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions led the Pacific League in attendance for nine straight
years, and have won 13 pennants in 13 years. Tsutsumi is distant
and discreet, but also a hard-driving owner who could match George
M. Steinbrenner III, for stark childhood lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father used to punch me a lot, whenever I did something he
didn't like,'' he once said. ``And I could let him do it. Even in
school when I was young. He used to hit me even after I got out of
college, the last time was when I was 27. I think that was a
valuable thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In his spare time, Tsutsumi ponied up the money that brought the
1998 Winter Olympics to Nagano. Monday, instead of bringing
snowboarders to Nagano, Tsutsumi brought the New York Mets to the
suburbs. The rich do like to hobnob with each other. Can a
Champions League be far behind? &QL;

RIBS, HAWAIIAN-STYLE, BUT WITHOUT THE SPAM 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Signs posted prominently at a beach entrance on Maui's southwest
coast list the dangers involved in swimming, snorkeling, surfing or
splashing in the Pacific. In large letters, the signs warn: ``Never
turn your back on the ocean!''
</P>
<P>
   Tourists who heed those instructions literally will either set a
record for endurance swimming when they step ashore in Japan. Or
else they won't.
</P>
<P>
   Either possibility would probably be acceptable to Maui's native
Hawaiians. One-way swims away from the island should eventually
clear the roads of rental cars and sweep the streets clean of
malahini.
</P>
<P>
   Pronounced Mah-le-HEE-nee, the word is Hawaiian for tourist or
newcomer. If the malahini is wearing a hula-girl T-shirt, the
accent is on the ``HEE.''
</P>
<P>
   Yr. Obdt. Correspondent has been learning the language so that I
won't holler for a cop (uwalo) when I'm actually trying to order
sweet potatoes (uwala) at Mama's Fish House in Paia.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all restaurants also carry English names on the menu.
But unless you learn that the cute little fish you had your eye on
is spelled humuhumunokunkuapua'a, you're not playing the game. And
don't overlook the apostrophe before the final ``a.'' It signifies
a glottal stop _ or a total break in sound.
</P>
<P>
   I thought I had a grasp on the glottal stop until I learned some
of them occur at the start of the word.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to me the Hawaiians have developed some off-putting
words. According to my pronunciation guide, an appetizer is
pronounced ``poopoo.'' Beer is pronounced ``pee-or'' and if you
want a cut of beef steak, you ask for ``pee pee.'' If your tongue
slips and you ask for poo-hee, what you get is octopus.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, octopus in wine sauce makes a terrific entree if you
cook it according to instructions in the 50th anniversary cookbook
published by the Maui Association for Family and Community
Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``To clean octopus, turn body inside out,'' the recipe begins.
The author might also have added, ``before the octopus turns you
inside out.''
</P>
<P>
   Other popular seafood selections include ahi (tuna), ono,
opakapaka (pink snapper), shutome (swordfish) and mahimahi
(dolphin.) But it seems the favorite fish in Hawaii kitchens is an
exotic creature known as a ``Spam.''
</P>
<P>
   The Maui cookbook contains recipes for Spam sushi, Spam won ton,
Spam salads, Spam and pineapple, Spam stir-fry, Spam tempura and
Spam deep-fried with eggplant, green tomato and Velveeta.
</P>
<P>
   I believe Velveeta was the polynesian god of edible lava.
</P>
<P>
   If you are unable to hook any Spam on your next fishing trip,
the Maui cookbook also has lots of terrific recipes for another
island favorite, kalbi ribs. Included is this one, which can be
prepared with either Maui or Walla Walla onions.
</P>
<P>
   Walla-Maui Ribs
</P>
<P>
   5 pounds short ribs
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters cup catsup
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon paprika
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chili powder
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters cup water
</P>
<P>
   2 large onions, sliced
</P>
<P>
   Cut the short ribs into serving pieces. Mix together all the
other ingredients except the onions, and pour over the ribs.
Refrigerate at least an hour, mooshing the ribs with the sauce once
or twice.
</P>
<P>
   Plunk everything into a large casserole and top with the onion
slices. Cover and bake in a 350-degree oven for 2 hours, checking
once or twice to ensure that the sauce isn't cooking away.
</P>
<P>
   When the meat is tender, serve the ribs with cooked rice or egg
noodles. This should be enough ribs for six or more guests.
</P>
<P>
   South Sea Squash
</P>
<P>
   2 acorn squash
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-third cups frozen peas, cooked
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons sour cream
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons dill weed
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   Cut the squash in half and remove seeds and fibers. Melt the
butter and add the brown sugar. Divide among the four squash
halves. Place squash in a pan, cut-side up. Pour { cup water into
the pan. Bake 75 minutes at 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the peas with the sour cream, dill and lemon juice.
Divide among the squash halves, then return them to the oven for 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to make this an authentic Hawaiian dish, you should
grow, cut and squeeze the sugar cane yourself. The process
shouldn't be that difficult. Just remember to never, ever turn your
back on the ocean.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ President Clinton failed in three hours of talks here
on Sunday to persuade the Syrian leader, Hafez Assad, to moderate
his differences with Israel, and the White House said afterward
that it was ``impossible'' to predict when talks between Israel and
Syria would resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe it would be productive for them to resume
now,'' the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said of the
Syrian-Israeli negotiations after Clinton headed home to Washington
on Sunday night. ``In our judgment it is not worthwhile to have
meetings for meetings' sake.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, who presented proposals from Prime Minister Ehud
Barak of Israel but none of his own, had decided to meet Assad on
his way home from a six-day tour of South Asia in the hope of
finding enough agreement between the Syrian and Israeli positions
that peace talks, which broke down in January, might resume.
</P>
<P>
   Though Lockhart would not address the substantive issues
discussed during the meeting on Sunday, the first face-to-face
encounter between Clinton and Assad in more than five years, it
appeared clear from the spokesman's terse comments that almost no
common ground was found on any issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are significant differences and a lot of hard work that
needs to be done,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   The quick ending here appeared to dash Clinton's hopes of
presiding over a comprehensive peace deal that would incorporate
Syria, the Palestinians and Israel before he left office. Instead,
there could well be a worsening situation between Israel and Syria,
some officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the talks on Sunday was met with near despair by
diplomats involved in both the Syrian and Palestinian tracks of the
Middle East peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very bad news,'' one diplomat in the region said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke to Barak just before the talks began and again
after they ended, Lockhart said. In a written statement, Lockhart
said the administration ``will continue to try to help the parties
overcome these differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats speculated that Assad may have come to Geneva with
unrealistic expectations of what Barak was prepared to offer.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Assad, Joubran Kourieh, said the talks on Sunday
had dealt ``the obstacles which Israel put and is still putting to
the resumption of talks.''
</P>
<P>
   With the failure of the talks, it was now likely, the diplomat
in the region said, that Israel would move quickly to begin a
withdrawal from what it calls its security zone in southern
Lebanon. Once Israeli soldiers start leaving Lebanon, where Syria
is the dominant power, Syria will lose a bargaining chip with
Israel and the incentive to reach a deal will further evaporate,
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility then of conflict between Syrian-backed groups,
such as the Hezbollah guerrillas, striking Israel across the
international border between Lebanon and Israel was ``quite high,''
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no news conference with Clinton and Assad on Sunday
and the president left Geneva soon after the talks ended. He had
been prepared to extend the meeting through Monday if needed, his
aides said on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   If the talks had gone well here, it was anticipated that the
national security adviser, Sandy Berger, would brief reporters.
Instead, Lockhart spoke. And Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
who was to go to Israel to explain the results if the talks went
well, returned to Washington, too. Dennis Ross, the
administration's special envoy for the Middle East, will fly to see
Barak on Monday, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The talks opened in midafternoon with little fanfare in a green
and gold conference room in the Intercontinental Hotel here, the
same room where Clinton and the Syrian leader met in the spring of
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Assad, 69, who is in failing health, looked very thin in face
and body. At the urging of a Swiss photographer, the two leaders
shook hands during a quick photo session, as their delegations _
including Albright and the Syrian foreign minister, Farouk al-Shara
_ looked on.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Clinton and Assad met _ in Damascus in October
1994 _ the atmospherics were brittle. Then, at a joint news
conference, the Syrian leader denied that Syria backed terrorist
groups and took exception at the fact that Syria was on the State
Department's list of countries that support terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While the White House had tried in the last few days to play
down expectations on results of Sunday's session, senior
administration officials had also said that they had a good enough
grasp of the Syrian and Israeli positions to lay out a road map for
proceeding with talks.
</P>
<P>
   Three days ago, Berger told reporters that the ``best case
result would be that we have a sense of enough common ground that
negotiations could be resumed and that we could envision them
ending in success.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the breakdown of talks between Syria and Israel in
Shephardstown, W. Va., Clinton had talked with Barak and Assad by
telephone. Through these ``extensive conversations,'' Clinton
gained a fuller understanding of the ``needs'' of both sides,
Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major sticking points, according to administration
officials and diplomats, came down to what would constitute the
international border between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Assad has made clear, to his people at home and to the outside
world, that he wants an Israeli withdrawal to the border that
existed between the two countries on June 4, 1967, just before
Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria. By this he means an
Israeli withdrawal right to the edge of the Sea of Galilee, which
provides much of Israel's water.
</P>
<P>
   But for Barak, having the Syrian border extend right to the
banks of the Sea of Galilee is unacceptable for security and
emotional reasons, administration officials and diplomats said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the last several weeks, the question became how to compromise
on the Sea of Galilee or as an administration official said ``how
to finesse it so that the border of Israel remains just beyond the
eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before the talks began on Sunday morning, a Western
diplomat who is in touch with the Americans, the Israelis and the
Syrians predicted that there would be no progress in Geneva
``because Syria will not yield on the banks of the Sea of
Galilee.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's session was the first time that Assad _ through Clinton
_ had heard Barak's bottom-line on the issues that divided them.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those issues represented a ``double-edged sword, ''
Berger had said on the eve of the talks. ``If Israel decides that
it's going to withdraw from some portion of the Golan, it will give
up some modicum of security,'' he said. ``How are those security
needs going to be addressed? If Israel gives up some portion of the
Golan, is it for a paper peace or is it for a real peace? Those are
the questions that the Israelis are asking.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanging over the talks was the knowledge within both Clinton
administration and the Barak government that time was running out.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said he would put any agreement to a referendum, but
opinion polls show that popular support in Israel for a deal with
Syria has steadily eroded over the last few months. One survey
released last week in Israel showed that 55 percent of the
respondents said they would not trust a peace agreement signed with
Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Another element pointing to the shortage of time is Barak's
pledge to pull the Israeli army out of what Israel calls its
security zone in southern Lebanon by early July. It will take the
Israeli army three months to complete its withdrawal, thus troops
will begin pulling out next month, an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the all important border issue around the Sea of
Galilee, other questions that needed resolution included
arrangements for an early warning station on Mt. Hermon on the
Golan Heights; the amount of time that Israel would take to
withdraw from the Heights; and how quickly Syria would be willing
to normalize relations with Israel.

ISRAEL REACTS CAUTIOUSLY TO NEWS FROM GENEVA
</HEADLINE>
   (With CLINTON-ASSAD) 
(sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Cautious from the start, Israeli officials said on
Sunday that the failure of the meeting between President Clinton
and President Hafez Assad of Syria to produce a resumption of peace
talks did not necessarily signal the end of negotiations with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we're concerned the door has not closed,'' said Gadi
Baltiansky, a spokesman for Prime Minister Barak. ``If conditions
will be ripe in the future for the resumption of talks, we will
come to conduct bona fide negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Sunday meeting between Clinton and Assad began in
Geneva, Barak was guarded about its chances for success. Mindful of
Israel's differences with Syria, he told his Cabinet that the
summit in Geneva had no more than a 50 percent chance of reviving
the negotiations, which were resumed last December but broken off
in January.
</P>
<P>
   Some ministers predicted that if the talks resumed, an agreement
could follow in weeks, but if they did not, negotiations were
liable to go into a deep freeze.
</P>
<P>
   When the Geneva meeting was over and Clinton had spoken by phone
with Barak, officials said that serious differences remained over
such issues as the demarcation of borders and security
arrangements, including early warning measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are vital Israeli interests that Prime Minister Barak
will not concede,'' Baltiansky said. In any event, he added, ``the
prime minister is determined to continue moving forward, to
withdraw the army from Lebanon by July and to pursue talks on the
Palestinian track.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks between Israel and the Palestinians on a framework accord
for a permanent peace resumed on Monday in Washington, with a
target date of September 13 for a final treaty.

COMMENTARY: CONTRACTS FOR CRONIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the enduring paradoxes of government procurement is that
sweetheart deals tend to give off a terrible odor.
</P>
<P>
   The city's normally mild-mannered comptroller, Alan Hevesi, is
loudly objecting to a pair of particularly foul-smelling contracts
that improperly bypassed the competitive bidding process and, he
believes, were carefully and insidiously crafted to benefit cronies
of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The contracts, to help manage the city's welfare-to-work
program, were awarded to Maximus Inc. of McLean, Va., and are worth
$104 million. And they are renewable for an additional $104
million. They should have been competitively bid, but were not,
said Hevesi. One of the major beneficiaries of the contracts _ a
partner that would rather not be known as a partner in this venture
_ is a company called Opportunity America, which just happens to be
run by Richard J. Schwartz, a former senior adviser to Giuliani who
designed the mayor's welfare-to-work program.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunity, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   When he left government for the private sector, Schwartz said he
would not enter into any consulting contracts with New York City. I
guess he misspoke.
</P>
<P>
   For a glimpse of blatant favoritism in the awarding of
government contracts, consider the following:
</P>
<P>
   According to Hevesi, Maximus, in its application, asked to be
paid $4,620 for each person it was able to place in a job. But the
city, through the Human Resources Administration, would have none
of that. Maximus was told it must be paid more than $4,620. So the
price for each client placed in a job was jacked up to $5,000, an
increase worth millions over the life of the contracts.
</P>
<P>
   It pays to have friends in high places.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over these contracts erupted a couple of months
ago when the mayor began submitting, for Hevesi's approval, what
turned out to be 17 welfare-to-work contracts that had been awarded
without competitive bidding.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the contracts were with agencies that do fine work.
Nevertheless, they should have been competitively bid.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out, said Hevesi, that those contracts were supposed
to ``camouflage'' the biggest contract in the batch _ the one with
Maximus.
</P>
<P>
   When Hevesi and his aides began perusing the Maximus paperwork,
they found that Maximus had gotten what the comptroller described
as ``huge preferred treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the contracts were not competitively bid, notices
went out to companies that might have wanted to do the work that
was slated for Maximus. Preliminary discussions between those
companies and HRA were to begin March 2, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hevesi: ``We now have documents showing a series of
conferences, meetings and exchanges between Maximus and HRA
starting the prior December.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times' Nina Bernstein, in a story earlier this
month, wrote: ``The city did not hold its first informational
meeting for other companies seeking to bid on the contracts until
mid-May.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, said Hevesi, was that Maximus had its contract
proposal ``all ready to go'' before anybody else was aware that
proposals would be requested.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``They had schematics for their offices in New York _
they had their salaries figured, you get the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, Hevesi and his aides discovered the Richard Schwartz
connection.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, who is also a former deputy campaign manager for
Giuliani, has repeatedly denied that he is a partner in this
venture with Maximus. He claims he is simply a subcontractor.
</P>
<P>
   But he's a subcontractor who walks, looks and smells very much
like a partner in this deal. The Maximus paperwork submitted to the
city says it is ``in partnership with'' Schwartz's company,
Opportunity America. And Opportunity America is, under the
contracts, supposed to get 30 percent of the $104 million.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller has refused to approve the contracts, saying he
will not participate in ``favoritism and cronyism.'' He has
referred the matter to the Manhattan district attorney and federal
investigators for possible further action.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani angrily denied that there was anything wrong with the
contracts and said he will sue Hevesi to force their approval.

 &HT;    Congressional Bill Could Unintentially Harm Patients
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO, Calif. - Congressional efforts to block
physician-assisted suicide could unintentionally harm patients
suffering great pain near death, an aging conference here was
warned Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bill, the Pain-Relief Promotion Act, is intended to
alleviate pain among terminally-ill patients, its passage could
have ``a chilling effect'' on the use of aggressive pain-relief
medications, said Marshall B. Kapp, an attorney and director of the
office of Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology at Wright State
University School of Medicine in Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Kapp, who said he agreed with the intent of discouraging
physician-assisted suicide in states such as Oregon, told a
conference at the annual American Society on Aging meeting here
that the bill would cause physicians to worry that they might
violate the law by prescribing pain relief medication in
potentially lethal doses even if their intent was merely to relieve
pain.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed the House in October by a vote of 271-156 and is
now pending in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Panel members at the conference, which focused on legal, moral
and practical concerns for caring for patients at the end of life,
said decisions regarding such care are often complicated by the
fact that patients may be suffering from numerous ailments as they
near death.
</P>
<P>
   Kapp and Monsignor Charles J. Fahey, senior associate at the
Third Age Center at Fordham University in the Bronx, N.Y., also
agreed that someone acting as the patient's proxy is prefererable
to so-called ``living wills.'' In a living will a patient puts in
writing whether he or she wants invasive and life-prolonging care
at the end of life. By contrast a patient can sign a durable power
of attorney in which someone is chosen to act at the patient's
representative in making end-of-life care decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Fahey said family members and friends who have participated in
caring for the dying patient should have priority in deciding how
much and what type care should be given at the end even if other
relatives might have a stronger legal claim but have not been close
to the patient.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians should not be bound by a living will in making
decisions about care, Kapp said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for a doctor to pick up a piece of paper and say 'is
this really what Mrs. Jones wants in this situation?' `` he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although some living wills may indicate that a patient does not
want surgery near the end of life, Kapp noted that some surgery
might be desirable to make the patient more comfortable even though
it might not make the patient live longer.
</P>
<P>
   Former Florida state Sen. Jack Gordon, D-Miami Beach, president
of the Hospice Foundation of America, said hospices have flourished
in part because they reject the medical model for treating dying
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Patients nearing death need a coordinated approach that
emphasizes relieving pain, helping the family and meeting the
person's emotional and spiritual needs, Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   The medical model for treating patients involves numerous
specialists each trying to cure a specific ailment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Catherine Eng, medical director of On Lok (CQ) Senior
Health Services in San Francisco, said the current generation of
medical students is being taught to give a high priority to
relieving pain.
</P>
<P>
   Eng said doctors do not intentionally seek to cause their
patients' pain, but the fractured system of medicine sometimes does
not allow physicians to treat the whole patient.

A RUSSIAN SKATER TESTS POSITIVE AND IS FORCED OUT OF WORLDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NICE, France _ The drama-filled career of the Russian pairs
skater Yelena Berezhnaya took another turn today when the
International Skating Union announced on the eve of the world
figure skating championships that she had tested positive for a
banned stimulant in a random drug test.
</P>
<P>
   Berezhnaya and her partner, Anton Sikharulidze, the two-time
world pairs champions, already had been withdrawn from the
championships by the Russian Figure Skating Federation because of
the positive test.
</P>
<P>
   In a communique, the skating union said that Berezhnaya, now
based in Hackensack, N.J., with Sikharulidze and their renowned
coach, Tamara Moskvina, indicated that she had ingested the banned
and unspecified stimulant inadvertently while trying to treat
bronchitis.
</P>
<P>
   The skating union also said that the Russian federation had
indicated that both it and Berezhnaya had accepted the positive
result and waived the right to have her B sample analyzed. The ISU
council, which rules on drug-testing offenses, will now determine
the penalty. Depending on the type of stimulant Berezhnaya
ingested, she faces a ban from competition of between three months
and two years.
</P>
<P>
   Positive drug tests are rare in figure skating. The most recent
involving a prominent skater came in 1991 when Marina Klimova,
another Russian skater, tested positive for a banned steroid. A
second test exonerated her a few weeks later, and Klimova later won
the Olympic ice dancing title in 1992 with her husband, Sergei
Ponomorenko.
</P>
<P>
   Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze won a silver medal in the 1998
Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, and then won their first world
title that spring. They were the dominant pair last season,
although their victory in the 1999 world championships in Helsinki,
Finland, was far from convincing. Berezhnaya fell during the free
program, but she and Sikharulidze still finished ahead of the
technically superior Chinese pair of Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the judges of the event, Alfred Korytek of Ukraine, and
Svyatoslav Babenko of Russia, were later suspended and then banned
from judging by the skating union for collusion after a Canadian
television network filmed them communicating during the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze were beaten by Shen and
Zhao at the ISU Grand Prix final for the second year in a row, but
the Russians won their national title and the European
championships, defeating their domestic rivals Marya Petrova and
Aleksei Tikhonov in both competitions.
</P>
<P>
   When the Soviet Union dissolved, Berezhnaya initially
represented the Baltic state of Latvia and competed with Oleg
Sliakov. Her career nearly ended in January 1996 when she was hit
in the head by Sliakov's skate blade while practicing a camel spin.
She was hospitalized and had to undergo extensive rehabilitation
and speech therapy.

MICHIGAN STATE IS LOOKING FOR MORE THAN NET 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ The Michigan State Spartans hardly hurried
to take scissors to the net after winning the Midwest Regional
Saturday night. Instead, they circled the floor at the Palace and
saluted the raucous crowd, which boomed the school's fight song in
one voice.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Mateen Cleaves, Morris Peterson, A.J. Granger, Andre
Hutson and Charlie Bell have strings of nylon from last year when
they advanced to the Final Four. No, the nets they want droop from
the orange rims at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis, where the national
champion will be crowned next Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong, this is a great accomplishment and I'm
glad we did it here in front of our people,'' said Cleaves, his
ears still ringing from the Michigan State faithful who made the
80-minute drive from East Lansing. ``But we stayed together to win
this whole thing _ to be champions.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in the regional, the Spartans wiped out
their opponent's leads with the kind of blurring rallies usually
witnessed on the Motor City's speedways. Against Iowa State, the
Spartans needed just two minutes to turn a 61-55 deficit into a
64-61 lead before finishing off the Cyclones with a 11-3 run and a
75-64 victory. In the final six minutes against Syracuse on
Thursday, the Spartans squeezed off 19 straight points to barrel
past the Orangemen 75-58.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach always says tough players win,'' said Peterson, who
scored all but five of his 18 points against the Cyclones in the
second half, referring to Coach Tom Izzo. ``And I thought down the
stretch, we showed how tough we were. I think Mateen says it best _
we've got a refuse-to-lose attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   They are resilient and tough, too. They clawed out a 9-4 record
in their first 13 games without Cleaves, who was out with a
fractured foot. The Spartans' other guard, Bell, has hobbled
through the tournament and missed practices with tendinitis in his
left knee, but he found extra burners and rediscovered a smooth
gait on Saturday to power the Spartans' final rush.
</P>
<P>
   The tight-knit Spartans will travel to Indianapolis with a heavy
heart. Moments after Peterson soared along the baseline and stuffed
down a lob pass from his best friend, Cleaves, that demoralized the
Cyclones for good, the senior was told his grandmother, Clara Mae
Spencer, had died early Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   His family decided to tell him after the game in the Michigan
State locker room with Izzo and Cleaves. She had suffered a stroke
in February and had been in an out of a coma. ``My grandmother was
right there with me,'' he said, his eyes still red from tears. ``It
seemed like somebody was guiding those shots in. When I got the
news, it was very emotional. My grandmother was my best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson insisted he would attend her wake and funeral in
Mississippi on Thursday and Friday before the Spartans take on
Wisconsin in the semifinals Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to go,'' he said. ``She's been there for me. She'd do
anything for her grandkids.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans _ the only top-seeded team remaining _ once more
cannot bank on accomplishing what they set out and failed to do
last season: win the national title. A year ago, a 36-1 Duke team
bounced them in the semifinals. This season, the first obstacle in
what has been a wacky tournament is a team as iron willed as
Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers (24-10) have made the tournament field only six
times in the school's history, last advanced to the Final Four 59
years ago and won the title and have already been beaten three
times by the Spartans in Big Ten play _61-44, 59-44, 55-46.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Iowa State game, another Spartan senior, Granger,
said that despite the team's impressive record _ 30-7 _ this had
been one of the most trying years at Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We struggled without Mateen; we've been banged up and
frustrated at times because we couldn't put 40 minutes of good
basketball together,'' Granger explained. ``But at the same time
we've gotten to know each other real well and understand some
truths _ like not everybody can score all the time, that sometimes,
you know, you need a guy like Mateen to get on you. We've learned
to trust each other, though, and know what to do when it's each of
ours' turn.''
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room late Saturday, Cleaves made it clear that the
Spartans know there is one last thing that he and his teammates can
do together. ``We can play two perfect games _ a full 40 minutes
each playing as hard as we can,'' he said, then added
matter-of-factly, ``We do that and we go out on top.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Spartans will hurry to the ladder. And they will divvy
up the net. &QL;

THOUSANDS GATHER FOR `ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME' EVENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VANESSA HO  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ From sky to water to land, they staked out turf,
chugged caffeine and champagne, and braved the predawn chill.
</P>
<P>
   By sunrise Sunday, thousands of people had crowded onto
overpasses, beaches and parks; sailed into Elliott Bay; and
ascended the Space Needle and downtown high-rises to watch the
mushrooming dust of the Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Some cheered and hurled firecrackers; others quietly watched an
old friend self-destruct.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve hours before the implosion, the Dirks family had squeezed
their RV into the last parking space near Seacrest Park in West
Seattle. Like many Dome-watchers, they had a restless night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a once-in-a-lifetime event, worth a bad night's
sleep,'' said Greg Dirks, munching on eggs and tortillas Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a guy thing,'' said his wife Nancy. ``I'm just along
for the ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Some ride.
</P>
<P>
   As the dome fell, crowds whooped it up from balconies, barbecues
and brunches. They also cheered from the King County Jail, where
prisoners had a terrific view.
</P>
<P>
   On Elliott Bay, boats and Jet Skis jockeyed for position. As the
Dome fell, cheers and boat horns resounded across the water.
</P>
<P>
   Near Harborview Medical Center, Maille Kessenich, of Bothell,
slept in her car all night bto snag a view.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried camping at the hospital last night but security
kicked us out,'' she said. Some of her relatives had driven from as
far away as Chelan, Mill Creek and Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been looking forward to this for two years,'' said
Kessenich's brother Steve Farrar. ``The day we found out about it
we decided, all right, explosion party!''
</P>
<P>
   At packed Victor Steinbrueck Park, Lorene Garris and
17-year-daughter Nicole arrived from Edmonds at 5 a.m. to film the
Dome from a grassy knoll.
</P>
<P>
   A Mariners' fan for more than 20 years, Garris, 40, said games
were fun in the warmth of the Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you've got to bring an umbrella and wear your thermals,''
she said. ``It seems like the dome should have been there forever,
like an ancient building in Egypt. It's an icon.''
</P>
<P>
   From Kenmore, Shawn Boling, 37, drove to Seattle to witness
destruction over blueberry muffins and coffee.
</P>
<P>
   A Puget Sound native, Boling said he'll miss the landmark from
the skyline, even though it was ugly and a little clammy inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty hideous, but it was one of the things that made
Seattle Seattle,'' said Boling, a district manager for Aramark
Uniform Services. ``The Dome, grunge, coffee _ that's how we got to
be so unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen-year-old Lydia Allen said losing the Dome was like
losing a piece of her past. For her eighth birthday, her mom had
taken her to her first concert there _ a sold-out New Kids on the
Block show.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the dust, some struck gold.
</P>
<P>
   Janna Pekaar and friend Mark Ukelson made $60 by performing a
personal rendition of the implosion: Pekaar wore a mini-Dome made
of hula hoops, chicken wire, newspaper, and a pie tin.
</P>
<P>
   For a dollar, Ukelson would push the button (really a bike
pump), prompting Pekaar to scream, sprinkle dust and make her dome
tumble.
</P>
<P>
   Comedy aside, the Central Area graduate student said she was
angry that the city was destroying a perfectly good building _
especially, she said, when class sizes are big and teachers have to
buy their own supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Many others, however, found a reason to party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say death to the Dome!'' hollered kayaker Chris Littlefair
from Elliott Bay. ``Death to the Dome!''
</P>
<P>
   At Occidental Park, about 200 people _ some shirtless, others
bundled in blankets _ crowded a police barricade, hooting and
tossing firecrackers as newscopters buzzed overhead.
</P>
<P>
   At Times Square in New York City, about 50 people reacted with
typical attitude after seeing the live dust show on a big screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the end of an era,'' said John Kaminski, applauding
loudly. ``Maybe now they can get some pride back in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankee fan Adam Lusk also cheered. ``It's just too bad the
Seattle Mariners weren't in there when it went down _ after what
they did to the Yankees in the 1995 playoffs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   P-I reporters Scott Sunde, Heath Foster, Amy Nevala, Lewis Kamb,
Kimberly A.C. Wilson, Jack Hopkins and correspondent Nathan
Kitchens contributed to this report.

GUT INSTINCT SAYS IT WAS A BAD THING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ This time, the thump in the chest came from the
outside, not inside.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the provider of noisy heart-pounders, the Kingdome saved
its concussive best for last, sending a final astonishment aboard a
shock wave felt as much as heard.
</P>
<P>
   In a dynamite moment, the Northwest's first true major-league
sports stadium was no longer too ugly, too big, too small, too
cheap or too dark.
</P>
<P>
   All it was, barely two percent into its fanciful life expectancy
of a thousand years, was too bad.
</P>
<P>
   The perch was a couple of football fields from ground zero, in a
fifth-floor office above McRory's landmark restaurant at the edge
of the Kingdome's north parking lot. From there, the symbol of a
quarter-century of local sports and cultural history disappeared so
fast the old neighbor building shook.
</P>
<P>
   As the roiling dust cloud suddenly swallowed McRory's building
into several minutes of a surreal mocha twilight, the Kingdome
provided one more glimpse of the previously unseen -- the location,
taste, smell and feel of smithereens.
</P>
<P>
   Concrete dust, flakes, pigeon feathers and the detritus of a
once-great notion flushed through the open window, giving a new
meaning to the sports phrase ``chalk talk.''
</P>
<P>
   As eyes watered and noses filled with an acrid sniff of
gunpowder and ash, instinct said a bad thing just happened.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but the head knew better. This was a good thing. Right?
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand natives and McRory's visitors Stephen Connor and his
mother, Betty, vacationing in Seattle, had read up a bit about the
Kingdome's controversial history. A few minutes before the building
went away, they remained puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   ``You owe so much on the building, but you don't pay for it, you
just blow it up,'' Stephen said, smiling. ``I guess that's the
ultimate American way.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Betty: ``That's what's called progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it was never that simple. Then again, how does one explain
a facility that cost $68 million in public money when it opened,
then 24 years later had a $120 million mortgage despite many years
of profitable operation, and wouldn't be paid off until 2016?
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, a bad thing did happen, over time. Even if it could be
explained to visitors, they wouldn't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   The only reassurance offered was that in June, 1997, 51 percent
of the state's voters thought the plan to replace the Kingdome was
a good idea. It wasn't mentioned that some of these same people
thought the WTO meetings in Seattle were a good idea, too.
</P>
<P>
   As the particle storm spread out over downtown and the Sound,
depositing a grainy return to citizens of their tax dollars, the
roof door on McRory's building was cleared to open.
</P>
<P>
   Shuffling through the debris and dust of the now-sunlit
spectacle, a small scrap of paper was found. It was backing, still
attached to the fluffy ceiling material that was sprayed onto the
Kingdome's underside following the 1994 fallen-tile debacle.
</P>
<P>
   Visible on the scrap were words and a small diagram, apparently
a cross-section of the layers of the Kingdome roof. One arrow on
the diagram pointed to the fundamental virtue of the roof, and
therefore the building: ``Waterproofing membrane.''
</P>
<P>
   As has been much chronicled and debated lately, Seattle has been
undergoing massive change, thanks to a booming economy and enormous
individual and corporate wealth. Never has that change been
manifested more dramatically than Sunday's hole punched in the
skyline. By 2002, the change becomes more startling with
side-by-side sporting palaces built with more than $600 million in
tax dollars, exclusive of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, even the weather is changing. We no longer need a
waterproofing membrane.
</P>
<P>
   Who needs it, when we're already getting soaked?

 &HT;    EDS: Story originally slugged POPE-RELIEF
 &HT;    Many felt anxious despite tight security for Pope's visit to
Israel
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Pope John Paul II's trip here is being hailed as a
moral and spiritual triumph, but it
</P>
<P>
   was not without its wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Palestinians rioted in the Dehaisheh refugee camp
after the pontiff held Mass in nearby Manger Square. Some Jews
complained that John Paul fell short in addressing the Church's
responsibility during the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   And the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem suggested to the media the
night before the papal visit to the Old City that Palestinians
might
</P>
<P>
   disrupt his trip.
</P>
<P>
   But in the final analysis, John Paul's visit to this religious
and political cauldron was an unequivocal success in the eyes of
many: He lived to tell about it.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that the pope could meet his end in the Jewish
state in the same city where Jesus was crucified was an underlying
and often unspoken source of anxiety throughout this nation for
months leading up to this trip.
</P>
<P>
   The implications were nothing short of biblical. Though the
Second Vatican Council repudiated the concept of Jewish guilt for
the death of Jesus in 1965, the consequences of theologically
motivated anti-Semitism are indelibly branded into the collective
Jewish consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   So the prospect that Christ's vicar on earth _ as the pope is
understood to be by the world's 1.1 billion Roman Catholics _ could
be assassinated here, perhaps even by a Jew, seemed potentially
cataclysmic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the anxious type but I said a little prayer a few
weeks ago that nothing would happen to him while he was in
Israel,'' said Devorah Young, a religious Jew living in Jerusalem.
``I think people would say they did it again, they killed Christ
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing inside the Old City on Sunday waiting to catch a
glimpse of the pope's motorcade, Rina Hakimian said the thought had
crossed her mind, especially since this is the 2,000th anniversary
of Jesus' birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something happened, the resurrection of the idea of Jews
killing Jesus would be impossible to avoid,'' said Hakimian, a
lawyer living in Jerusalem. ``The image of Jews as Christ-killers
is still very much alive in a lot of circles.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while officials touted the massive international press
coverage as an unrivalled public relations opportunity, the
coverage also meant that any attack on the pope would be broadcast
around the world instantaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Operation Old Friend,'' the single largest security effort for
any visitor in the history of the state, was launched to minimize
the danger.
</P>
<P>
   More than 18,000 police and 4,000 soldiers worked security
details during the six-day trip. Police were not allowed to take
vacation while the pope was here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was glad to see all the security,'' said Tony Elia, a 25
year-old graduate student living in Jerusalem. ``There was a lot of
talk around campus that every 2,000 years was a tradition and it
was kind of sick.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul's visit through the Old City of Jerusalem on Sunday
was the most difficult for security forces to prepare for,
officials said. While about $3 million was pumped into Jerusalem to
ready the roads for the pope's arrival, only so much could be done
to modernize the square-mile maze of thousand-year-old alleys and
rooftops.
</P>
<P>
   Security forces, including Israel's equivalent of the CIA and
FBI, saturated the area. At the Jaffa Gate, where the pope's
procession exited the Old City, snipers took positions on top of
nearly every visible rooftop and balcony. Two helicopters circled
in the air and hundreds of soldiers with rifles lined the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officers corralled dozens of men deemed to be
suspicious _ Jews and Arabs alike _ away from the pope's proposed
exit route.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world supplies the actors,'' said Ehud Naveh, who
coordinated preparations for the pope's visit. ``We supply the
stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Less conspicuously, 150 security cameras posted above the alleys
filmed virtually every person in the Old City. The government has
been installing the cameras since last year with the pope's visit
in mind, officials said. Images are piped into a nearby police
station and monitored on dozens of television screens in a single
room.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of some grumbling about traffic tie-ups,
Israelis took the virtual martial law in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted that (the pope) came by, but if anything
happened we would get blamed again,'' said Gila Gottlieb, a Jew
living in Jerusalem. ``I'm going to be glad when he gets out of
here today.''

BOOK ON RED IS ONE GREAT READ

   LOS ANGELES _ Book title: ``Red Smith on Baseball: The Game's
Greatest Writer on the Game's Greatest Years''
</P>
<P>
   Vital stats: Ivan R. Dee Publishing, 363 pages with index,
$24.95.
</P>
<P>
   The intent: Here are 167 columns that the fabled New York Herald
Tribune and New York Times sportswriter pounded out from 1941 to
1981 (a year before his death), arranged chronologically to capture
the essence of the game and how it evolved during that 40-year
period.
</P>
<P>
   The execution: Exposing the best of Smith to anyone under 40
years old is a must. And even better, this collection definitely
stands the test of time.
</P>
<P>
   An excerpt: A tongue-in-cheek column about why the spitball
should be reinstated, written June 8, 1961:
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans today who never saw a kosher spitter thrown will tell you
that the damp delivery was banned because it is difficult to
control and consequently a menace to life and limb, or because it
is unsportsmanlike, or because it might offend fastidious
customers, or because there is something intrinsically dishonest,
not to say immoral, about moistening the hide of a dead horse. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It's high time the poor slob (pitcher) got a break. These days
he can't even depend on his catcher having a raised eyelet on his
mitt and carving up the ball for him now and then. Sure as
anything, some interfering tape of an umpire would ring in a new
ball on the very next pitch.''

NCAA WOMEN'S TOURNAMENT GAMES APPEAR WITH THE INFOMERCIALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ It is difficult to tell from the evidence
available this past weekend whether the National Collegiate
Athletic Association and its television partner are trying to
promote women's basketball or to kill it.
</P>
<P>
   First, the NCAA placed the semifinals and final of the national
tournament's West Regional in a discarded arena, Memorial Coliseum,
where the floor has several dead spots. The Rose Garden, home of
the Portland Trail Blazers, sits right next door, available,
ignored. As organizers of last summer's Women's World Cup pointed
out, a second-class arena signals a second-class event.
</P>
<P>
   Second, ESPN chose to start Rutgers' regional semifinal against
Alabama-Birmingham at 12:30 a.m. Sunday Eastern time, consigning
the game to infomercial wasteland. Rutgers won, 60-45, but the only
people who most likely saw it were channel-surfing for bamboo
steamers and pan-flute artists.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's regional final against top-seeded Georgia will start at
midnight in the East, guaranteeing another small audience of hoop
junkies and mistaken seekers of Victoria Principal's skin-care
products. Even worse, the winner will have to fly cross-country and
play on three days of rest Friday at the Final Four in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wonder what kind of mind-set goes into this,'' Rutgers
Coach C. Vivian Stringer said. ``We know the name of the game is
green, it's not about women. It's about how they can best get their
dollar. That's the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowered expectations have always been the bane of women's
sports. The problem has been particularly exacerbated for minority
women. When Tasha Pointer was being recruited to play point guard
at Rutgers, she said that the athletic director at Whitney Young
High School on Chicago's West Side tried to discourage her.
</P>
<P>
   Pointer said the athletic director told her, ``It's like an Ivy
League school,'' hinting that she might not measure up
academically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people, a lot of times, discourage minorities and make
them question their own abilities,'' Pointer said. ``My parents
always taught me to believe in myself, and that I can do anything I
want with hard work and determination.''
</P>
<P>
   A junior, the effusive Pointer is on the dean's list at Rutgers,
majoring in broadcasting. She said that she will have an internship
with CBS Sports this summer. While spending time in New York City,
she hopes to engage in two of her passions, basketball and chess.
She began playing chess in grade school, she said with a laugh, to
avoid having to go straight home from school to baby-sit for her
younger brother after basketball season was over. She played in
school, and she brought her chessboard along with her basketball to
St. Louis Park in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chess is a lot like playing point guard,'' Pointer said. ``You
have to learn to think two or three moves ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday night, while her team was playing somnolently, and
even Rutgers' pep band was yawning, the Scarlet Knights let an
early lead dissipate in the second half. Twice, Alabama-Birmingham
threatened to go ahead, but both times Pointer kept Rutgers in the
lead with an assist or a shot, a long pass or a knifing drive to
the basket. She played all 40 minutes and finished with an
impressive line: 11 points on 5-of-8 shooting, 6 rebounds, 9
assists and 1 turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the 5-foot-6-inch Pointer became Stringer's
second pivotal recruit, joining guard Shawnetta Stewart, who had
scored more career points than Wilt Chamberlain had while in high
school in Philadelphia. It was a tough time at an anonymous
basketball school, when people were asking, ``Where is Rutgers?''
and ``What is Rutgers?'' Stringer played to Pointer's pioneering
spirit, convincing her not to follow another school's
well-established path, but to come to Rutgers and create her own
path. Stringer calls it the bumblebee theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't believe what the scientists say, `That your body is too
fat and your wings are too heavy and aerodynamically you are not
capable of flying,''' Stringer implored, referring to the
possibilities of building Rutgers into a national power. ``We
continue to function as bumblebees.''
</P>
<P>
   In Pointer's freshman season, Rutgers advanced to the Round of
16, possessing a kind of innocence that displaced fear and
self-doubt, until it met undefeated Tennessee and was humbled,
92-60, in the regional semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just innocent youth,'' Pointer said. ``Tennessee
showed us how much work you've got to put into winning.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive year, Rutgers (25-7) has trampolined
into a regional final, this time against Georgia (32-3), which
shredded North Carolina, 83-57, earlier Saturday. No one doubts
Rutgers' disruptive matchup zone, but many question whether Rutgers
has the scoring ability to match Georgia, which defeated Tennessee
by 27 points earlier this season. Then again, Pointer has never
bowed to lower expectations.
</P>
<P>
   It is unfortunate for her that the television ratings will come
nowhere near as high as her hopes. &QL;

THIS MAC ATTACK IS OFF MARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When he orchestrated the team veto of the
all-expenses-paid (plus $25,000 apiece) trip to Tokyo for the 2000
big-league season opener, Mark McGwire was really flexing his
muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Good for him.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, none of the St. Louis Cardinals will be enriched by
Japanese culture unless they're lucky enough to someday be cut from
the team and have to go overseas groveling for work.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball asked the home-run king to go as a good-will gesture.
McGwire gave them another gesture. He said the international
competition did not ``turn my crank.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Mac Daddy fear that he'd miss MTV's ``Spring Break'' week?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese have their own brand of baseball over there,''
McGwire said. ``I know Major League Baseball wants to do more
internationally, but there's no purpose in it. I don't agree with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs and Mets thank you for your small-minded, self-centered
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Y'know, if baseball wants to keep calling it a !ital!World
Series, someday it's gonna have to recognize the sport exists
outside the North American TV market.
</P>
<P>
   --So why aren't the Dodgers involved in this overseas excursion
after all the team has done for international relations? If Peter
O'Malley were running the show, that wouldn't have slipped by.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, they'll open the season outside the country, too. In the
Siberian tropics known as Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   How are the players supposed to smuggle back authentic Pokemon
cards from Canada? ...
</P>
<P>
   --When Mike Morgan, Jesse Orosco and Rickey Henderson all make
the final major-league rosters this week, they'll become the 23rd,
24th and 25th big-leaguers to accomplish what obscure feat?
</P>
<P>
   Be an active player in four decades, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Although !ital!active is a rather subjective term....
</P>
<P>
   --As Iowa State proved, UCLA still needs a coach who can adjust
during a game. Right, slick?...
</P>
<P>
   --They were supposed to hold Congressional hearings this week on
that NCAA-backed piece-o-legislation that would make it illegal to
bet on all amateur sporting events. Now they've been pushed back to
probably May.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is fairly obvious, as we tried to point out a few
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect it would be rather embarrassing to my colleagues to
have these hearings during March Madness,'' Sen. Richard Bryan
(D-Nev.) admitted to the Associated Press. ``I would bet that
two-thirds, if not more, of the Senate offices have pools betting
on which teams advance in which brackets. Our office has had a pool
for years.''
</P>
<P>
   You betcha....
</P>
<P>
   --There exists a city called Bracketville, in Texas. And the
citizens love the commercials....
</P>
<P>
   --After watching the Kingdome blown to kingdom come, we'll
gladly pick up the tab to have the L.A. Sports Arena placed next
before the firing squad.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, let's shoot for April 15 when the next Xtreme Pro
Wrestling show takes place....
</P>
<P>
   --Like I was saying, Hollywood Henderson was a real money
player....
</P>
<P>
   --Mark it on the calendar: Fayetteville, N.C., the birthplace of
the Putt-Putt Golf Course of America, will host the prestigious
$100,000 Professional Putters Association National Putting
Championship from July 30 to Aug. 5.
</P>
<P>
   There'll be 215 pro and amateurs entered. What distinguishes the
two? Last year's champ, 36-year-old John Napoli of Clearwater
Beach, Fla., shot a perfect 18 over 18 holes to win.
</P>
<P>
   Now you go out and do !ital!that at the Family Fun Center, with
a bunch of red-and-blue balls and sawed-off clubs, and kids
screaming for cotton candy, and the group playing behind you with
that one knucklehead who continues to smack his ball up the fairway
while you're trying to line up a 2-inch putt, after the ball you
previously were using got stuck in that tube beneath the windmill
and won't come out, and your wife stuck her club up the tube to try
to knock it out and ended up falling into the murky waters of that
moat near the castle.

ELECTION POLITICS INCREASINGLY WIRED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY and ROBERT GAVIN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet-intensive campaigns of presidential candidates John
McCain and Bill Bradley are gone, but the Web promises to have a
sweeping effect on the 2000 election and to change the way
campaigns are run in America.
</P>
<P>
   Already Arizona Democrats have conducted the nation's first
e-mail presidential primary. And Vice President Al Gore has boasted
of how e-mail is replacing the telephone as his means of
communicating with staff aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, will it change the ways elections are fought
(and) the way issues are debated? Will the power be shifted?''
asked Steven Clift, the board chairman of Minnesota e-democracy, a
non-profit, non-partisan group.
</P>
<P>
   That is perhaps the key question as politicians, political
parties, lobbyists, grass-roots organizations and citizens look
ahead to the increasingly wired world.
</P>
<P>
   The most optimistic see a device that can break the grip of
money and powerful special interests that seem to drive politics
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet was the tool that allowed me to stay competitive
on the money front,'' Bradley said in an interview. ``We knew there
were established sources of money in the party. We knew they were
likely to go overwhelmingly for the vice president (Gore). We had
to find new ways of giving and new givers. The Web was our means of
finding the sort of people who would be sympathetic to our
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley lost his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination,
but he argues that the Web is an affordable, accessible tool that
can level the playing field for newcomers and insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain would agree.
</P>
<P>
   As his Straight Talk Express bus plowed through a fresh New
Hampshire snowfall in January, the Republican presidential hopeful
joked: ``The computer Web site is a modern device for living off
the land.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web helped McCain raise a record $10 million in February,
with $3.7 million arriving via cyberspace. An estimated $2 million
poured in during the four days after McCain's win in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura used the Internet in 1998, and won.
</P>
<P>
   A long-shot, third-party candidate who beat two long-established
politicians, Ventura made the Internet the central structure of his
campaign, said Andrew Blauh of the Markle Foundation, which is
studying the impact of technology on public affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet allowed them to operate as if they had a large
campaign infrastructure,'' Blauh said. ``It allows a different type
of campaign. It allows insurgents to operate at a level that they
couldn't before.''
</P>
<P>
   Using e-mail and regular Web-postings, the Ventura campaign
organized volunteers, coordinated their activities and got people
out to rallies. But this time, work that in the past might have
required volunteers to come into campaign headquarters was done at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Karr, the treasurer of last year's I-695 campaign in
Washington and the campaign manager of Tim Eyman's new initiative
efforts, said e-mail proved an invaluable and cheap way of tying
together and coordinating the work of far-flung, loosely-organized
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   When the campaign needed to get up lawn signs, it set up
self-serve pick-up sites and posted the locations on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so much cheaper to direct people to pick them up,''
Karr said. ``When your campaign is a lot of guerrilla warfare, it
really does help because it's free. You have to utilize every free
resource.''
</P>
<P>
   Low-cost and speed are what make the Internet a favorite tool of
grass-roots and insurgent campaigns. Here are some reasons why:
</P>
<P>
   Politicians can raise money over the Internet at a fraction of
the cost of direct-mail fund-raising, which can suck up to 40
percent of the money for administrative costs, according to David
Chiu, co-founder and vice president of Grassroots.com, a political
Web site that offers fund-raising services.
</P>
<P>
   The low-overhead and convenience makes it more attractive to
seek small donors and multiplies the donors' impact.
</P>
<P>
   Money raised over the Internet becomes available almost
instantly. Hit-and-run campaigns like McCain's can quickly tap into
new money and then compete in new contests without missing a beat.
``It was the key to our survival,'' said Secretary of State Ralph
Munro, who chaired McCain's campaign in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail is almost instant. Within moments, grass-roots
organizations can alert their supporters of an important vote in
the Legislature and those supporters can e-mail their
representatives while they're voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It levels the playing field for everybody,'' said Ed
Zuckerman, executive director of Washington Conservation Voters.
``It has a huge upside potential to open up the process for
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Broder, the veteran Washington Post political writer,
raises the prospect of a downside in his new book ``Democracy
Derailed,'' which deals with the growing use of voter initiatives
and referendums in 24 states that permit them.
</P>
<P>
   Broder worries that a wired society, with information instantly
available to all, will seek to push aside representative
government. He wonders about whether checks, balances and
restraints established by America's founders can survive the
Information Age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think it will be long before the converging forces of
technology and public opinion coalesce in a political movement for
a national initiative _ to allow the public to substitute the
simplicity of majority rule by referendum for what must seem to
many frustrated Americans the arcane, ineffective, out-of-date
model of the Constitution,'' writes Broder.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Internet has proved easily adaptable to the worst
features of modern campaigning _ personal attacks, distortion of
foes' records, consultant-created issues and the spreading of nasty
rumors about an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   During the Democrats' recent nomination battle, Gore's site
pointed surfers to his ``Bradley Information Bureau,'' which
criticized Bradley's positions and contained nasty observations
from Gore surrogates. Bradley's ``More about Gore'' site was filled
with hostile information about Gore's abortion and health care
votes while he was a member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Blauh, of the Markle Foundation, noted that the political system
has a tendency to push back when threatened or co-opt the
technology that causes it discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Blauh said, Congress at first gave great weight to
e-mails that lawmakers received. When lawmakers realized the
technology could easily mass-produce the communications, they
discounted e-mail and gave new weight to a hand-written note, Blauh
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't just assume that the Internet is a hammer that's
going to break every other institution,'' Blauh said.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts are skeptical that the Internet can produce the
e-democracy that will reverse voter alienation. More information
doesn't necessarily translate into more participation, as is
witnessed by downward voting trends of the last few decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're interested in politics, (the Internet) is there, but
it really doesn't work the other way,'' said John Bowes, a
University of Washington communications professor. ``It isn't a
magic solution. Magic solutions, that's the stuff of Italian
operas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Bimber, director of the Center for Information Technology
at the University of California at Santa Barbara, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is changing how professional politics are organized, but
what it's not going to change is low citizen participation, low
turnout rates and lack of knowledge about politics,'' Bimber said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet will indeed provide more information for people
who are intensely interested in politics, but it's not going to
create interest in the rest of the population.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the Internet could just become another tool used by
politicians and handlers, like television, direct mail and other
media. Or it could encourage the types of candidates, issues and
messages that might reconnect alienated voters to politics.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a politician who found himself in hot water last year for
suggesting that he created the Internet, waxes eloquent on the
Internet's possibilities. But he still seems a little unsure about
what changes it will bring to his profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet offers an unsurpassed opportunity for people to
access information and act on it,'' he mused during a recent
Seattle visit. ``Just how they use this opportunity, we will have
to see.''

OPENTV, A SOFTWARE PROVIDER, TO BUY SPYGLASS FOR $2.5 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   OpenTV, the largest provider of interactive television software,
said Sunday that it would buy Spyglass Inc., which licenses
Internet-access software and offers consulting services on Internet
applications, in a stock deal valued at $2.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   OpenTV's software, which is used in 6.1 million set-top boxes _
primarily in Europe and Asia _ enables viewers watching, say, a
golf tournament to, with a click of the remote, call up more
information about the clubs the players are using or the clothing
they are wearing. But it does not provide the ability to browse the
Web, and it has been slow to catch on in the United States.
Spyglass, in contrast, has a large customer base in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely positive for both companies,'' said Coleen
Kaiser, an analyst who follows OpenTV for Merrill Lynch in London.
``OpenTV needed the Internet technology, and Spyglass needed the
name brand and relationship with network operators.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition gives OpenTV access to Spyglass' technology for
delivering Web information not only to set-top boxes but to mobile
phones and other wireless devices. Thus, it will enable OpenTV to
offer Web-browsing capability on set-top boxes and will give it a
toehold in the growing wireless communications market, both
domestically and overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can expand the services we offer and our customer base
without forgoing any of the services we offer now,'' said Jan W.
Steenkamp, OpenTV's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The whole concept of interactive television has excited
shareholders. Spyglass lost $1.9 million on $29.6 million in
revenue last year, yet its stock closed at $69.875 on Friday,
giving it a market value of $1.28 billion. Similarly, OpenTV lost
$9 million on revenue of about $26 million, yet its shares closed
at $169 on Friday, giving it a market value of about $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, OpenTV, which just went public in November, announced
an alliance with Health Hero Network Inc. a privately held company,
to create an interactive health channel on which doctors can
communicate with patients through their set-top boxes.

ANALYSIS: WHITE HOUSE ANXIOUS AS RUSSIAN VOTES ARE COUNTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (With RUSSIA-ELECTION, RUSSIA-VOICES) 
(mk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ When Acting President Vladimir Putin met behind closed
doors last month with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, he
made an unusual appeal that Russia be considered a member of the
Western club.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said that he liked to eat Chinese food, knew how to use
chopsticks and regularly practiced judo.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's exotic stuff,'' Putin said, according to aides who
attended the session. ``That's not our mentality. Our mentality is
European.''
</P>
<P>
   But Putin's stated desire for Russia to be in the Western camp
could be at odds with the expectations he has fanned for Russia to
become a stronger state and his promises to restore his country's
dented national pride.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has a lot riding on a Putin victory,
whether it comes Monday, as the early-morning election results
appeared to indicate, or must wait until a runoff next month. And
it has been heartened by his remarks about the need to integrate
Russia with the West.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton officials are not only anxious to get American-Russian
relations back on track after a year and a half of drift following
the August 1998 collapse of the ruble; in an election year, they
also want to silence Republicans who have charged that Russia fell
off the path of economic reform on President Clinton's watch.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton officials would also like to seal the Clinton presidency
with a major arms control accord _ one that would slash long-range
nuclear arms and enable the United States to field a new network of
anti-missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's autocratic instincts, however, have cast a shadow over
Washington's hopes. Setbacks on human rights or fresh reports of
Russian atrocities in Chechnya would be major obstacle to closer
relations, especially in an American election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton would like a strong leader he can work with but not
one that is unleashed,'' said Toby T. Gati, who served as a senior
State Department official during the Clinton administration. ``The
hope is that Putin will turn out to be a reformer. The president
and his advisers want to show Yeltsin left a legacy of reform that
Putin can build on. They want to rebut the critics who say their
Russia policy was a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   With a complex agenda of overlapping and competing interests,
there is no simple answer to what a Putin presidency could mean for
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect for closer ties is more favorable in the economic
sphere, where Putin's goals overlap with Western interests, than in
the area of security and human rights, issues where the two sides
often collide.
</P>
<P>
   On economics, Putin has signaled that he wants to establish the
foundations of a modern capitalist state, not because he has a
romantic infatuation with the free market but because he
understands that Russia must attract foreign investment and
overhaul its rust belt industries to become a world power.
</P>
<P>
   ``A country where weakness and poverty reign cannot be strong,''
Putin wrote in an open letter to the Russian people.
</P>
<P>
   To this end, Putin and his top aides have talked about
overhauling the tax code, protecting the rights of shareholders,
phasing-out subsidies to money-losing enterprises and tackling
politically dicey issues like establishing the right to own land.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have been impressed by Putin's talk of
economic change, including his insistence that he wants Russia to
be integrated in the world economy. They say that he appears
interested in achieving concrete results and understands that a
boom in oil prices that has helped the Russian economy is not a
substitute for reform.
</P>
<P>
   Much will depend, of course, on Putin's willingness to challenge
the tycoons that dominate much of the Russian economy to level the
playing field for business and investors.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials, however, are already
discussing steps the West might take to demonstrate its support if
Putin does undertake serious reform. They include expanding
assistance by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank,
rescheduling Russian debt, and stepped-up efforts by the U.S.
Export-Import Bank to encourage investment in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the `Who Lost Russia?' debate is behind us,'' Thomas
Pickering, the undersecretary of state and former U.S. ambassador
to Moscow, recently told a business group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Economics, however, is just one part of the agenda. Arms control
and foreign policy are also important. And here Putin's
nationalism, his background as a KGB officer and his domestic
constituency may make him less cooperative than Washington would
like.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration was pleased that Putin dispensed with
diatribes against Washington's plans for a limited anti-missile
defense during his February meeting with Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Putin said his goal was to preserve the principles of
the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. Administration officials
hope that vague formulation reflected a new, if cautious, sense of
pragmatism, one that might open the door to a grand bargain on
offensive and defensive systems in which the treaty would be
modified to accommodate the American antimissile program.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Russians are willing to negotiate over the matter,
however, the discussions may prove difficult. The Russian military
is strongly opposed to the antimissile program. And though Putin
recently restored ties with NATO, the political climate in Russia
is not conducive to wrenching compromises with the West.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of Russians who believe that Washington's hidden
goal is to take advantage of their country's weakness is at a new
high, according to the Clinton administration's own survey of
Russian opinion. The recent survey reports that 81 percent of
Russians believe the United States wants to reduce Russia to a
second-rate power, up from 59 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The mistrust stems from NATO's decision to expand eastward, the
Western alliance's war with Yugoslavia and the generally harsh
indictment of Russia by Western politicians and the Western media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the West thinks it knows what Putin will do on the ABM
treaty, but it is wishful thinking,'' Georgi Arbatov, the veteran
specialist on American-Russian relations, said about the arms
control treaty. ``We really don't know what Putin has in mind. The
attitude in Russia is against building of antimissile defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also Chechnya. The brutal war there has been
temporarily pushed out of the news by the Russian election, but it
is still raging.
</P>
<P>
   The West has denounced the indiscriminate attacks against
civilians there but has been careful not to link the issue with the
question of IMF assistance or other policy objectives. And while
Washington and Moscow both appear to be hoping that the war will
quiet down so that they can do business on other items on their
agenda, nobody can guarantee that it will.
</P>
<P>
   New reports of human rights abuses would dampen the
administration's enthusiasm for a headline-making summit or
high-level meetings with Putin, even if progress was made on
Washington's arms control agenda.
</P>
<P>
   And even with the best of intentions, a strategic alliance
between the United States and Russia remains a remote possibility.
The 47-year-old Putin is not only likely to re-energize relations
with the West; he is likely to intensify diplomacy on other fronts,
including former Soviet republics, Iran and China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials are also well aware of Putin's
talent for telling his audience what it wants to hear. And some
take his talk of Russia's fondness for the West's mentality and
values with a large grain of salt. Just imagine, they say, what
Putin will say about the United States when he meets with the
Chinese.

 &HT;    Wallace relieved to hit 50
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Tenn. _ OK, it's officially spring: Rusty Wallace has
won a race at Bristol Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   This one is a career milestone. Wallace earned career win No. 50
in the Food City 500 by outfighting the field in the No. 2 Ford
Taurus and avoiding calamities that brought out 11 cautions for 76
laps.
</P>
<P>
   He beat surprising Johnny Benson in the No. 10 Pontiac by a
comfortable 2.622 seconds for the $87,585 prize.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace becomes the 10th NASCAR driver in history with at least
50 victories.
</P>
<P>
   He had been stuck on 49 for 32 races. His last win was here,
last April. His first win was April 6, 1986 at Bristol. Eight of
his 50 wins have come at Bristol, six in the spring race.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he admitted No. 50 had become an obsession. It's why he
tested here this year for the first time in four years. ``I felt
like an addict: I've got to have it, I've got to have it,'' Wallace
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put a really big bull's-eye (on the calendar) right on this
race track and I told my guys, `this is ridiculous now. I've won
all my races at Bristol and Richmond and Martinsville and road
courses. I've got four car dealerships right down the street.
That's the site of my very first win. There are 147,000 people in
the grandstand and it's the number one most exciting track on the
circuit.''
</P>
<P>
   He was even inspired to name the new car he had built for this
track ``Bristol.'' He leaned heavily on his crew Sunday. But first
he had to receive some major gifts while biding his time. First,
Dale Earnhardt's fast Chevrolet was eliminated when it clipped the
wrecked car of Kenny Irwin as it slid down from the wall at turn 4
nearly halfway into the 500 laps. Then Jeff Gordon, who led for 225
laps, had his car damaged when he ran into a loose tire from the
car of Steve Park.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace overtook teammate Jeremy Mayfield over the last 100 laps
and weathered a couple more weird adventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the radio and I said, `Don't let this one get screwed
up. I want it,' '' Wallace said. ``(Crew chief) Robin (Pemberton)
was really making sure everybody was doing their job. We had a
lugnut fall off one time and I got on them about that. Then the
next time we had a heck of a fast stop going and some photographer
(was standing) on Bill Wilburn's air hose and we had a bad stop. I
think that guy is still in the air.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Having convinced itself that fantasy leagues are
not a form of gambling, and seizing an opportunity to make a little
cash on the side, Major League Baseball's official Web site has
established a faux paus league of its own this season for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Official Fantasy Baseball'' game (mlb.commissioner.com) at
the MLB site (www.majorleaguebaseball.com) follows the usual
routine: Fans submit a draft list, set an opening-day roster, make
free-agent acquisitions and trade with other league owners.
</P>
<P>
   All for $19.95 a pop.
</P>
<P>
   Every league winner gets an official baseball, with other prizes
including a trip to the 2000 World Series, regular-season tickets
and shopping on the site's store.
</P>
<P>
   For baseball to come around after years of resistance to this
concept is somewhat amusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been thinking about it for a number of years, and with
all the historical and cultural weight these carry, we have to be
careful about it,'' said Alex Kam, the site's VP/director of new
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concerns of gambling aren't something we have now because
it is so much a part of the game's fabric. They're everywhere and a
great way for fans to follow players.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all, it's a step in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Sportsline.com is listed as the official ``powered by'' site for
this game. It's all a copyright of Major League Baseball
Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first major sports league to offer a fantasy
version on its site. The NBA's official cyberhome (nba.com) has a
game called ``Virtual GM'' that carries no entry fee and has grand
prize of $750 worth of NBA merchandise. The site also has a link to
ESPN.com's family of fantasy games for every major sport.
</P>
<P>
   --The Angels, with the help of ACSSports.com, have juiced up
their Web site (www.angelsbaseball.com) with more updated
statistical information, audio archives of Angels highlights in
history narrated by Dick Enberg, and a daily diary by pitcher Brian
Cooper, who is trying to avoid being shipped back to Triple-A
Vancouver.

GORE TO UNVEIL CAMPAIGN FINANCE PLAN
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore, acknowledging himself to be
an ``imperfect messenger'' on the subject of campaign finance,
plans to propose a major change in federal campaign financing on
Monday and will pledge to make the overhaul of the system his top
domestic legislative priority.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposal calls for establishing an endowment fund from
donations by individuals, corporations and labor unions, among
others, to raise $7.1 billion over seven years, according to
briefing papers provided by his campaign. The interest from the
fund would be used to pay for the general election campaigns,
starting in 2008, of candidates for the House and Senate, but only
if they did not accept money from any other source.
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers say the amount of money would be based on a
combination of factors, including the average cost of previous
House and Senate elections, and for Senate races, population and
media accessibility in each state.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the endowment plan would not include presidential
campaigns; general elections are already financed partly by
taxpayers through the federal tax check-off system.
</P>
<P>
   Most immediately, Gore would push for passage of the
long-debated McCain-Feingold legislation that would ban the large,
unregulated contributions known as soft money.
</P>
<P>
   He would then appoint a board of trustees, which would have to
be confirmed by the Senate, and over the next seven years the
trustees would raise the money and manage the endowment fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you elect me as your president,'' Gore will say in remarks
prepared for delivery on Monday, ``the McCain-Feingold bill will be
the first domestic legislation I send to the Congress on my first
day in office.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumed Republican
presidential nominee, immediately denounced Gore's proposal. In a
statement on Sunday night, he called it ``a government takeover
that replaces individual spending decisions with decisions made by
an unelected government committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who opposes the public financing of elections, also took a
shot at Gore's credibility on this issue. ``Any promise to reform
our campaign finance system will ring hollow unless it's grounded
in credibility, credibility based on consistency, integrity and
disclosure,'' his statement said.
</P>
<P>
   While the concept of a trust or fund for federal campaigns has
been discussed for some time, Gore would add some incentives to
attract contributors to the fund.
</P>
<P>
   The incentive for corporations, labor unions and other campaign
contributors to give to the fund would be a 100 percent tax
deduction for their donations. The estimated cost to taxpayers of
these deductions would be $2.13 billion over seven years. The Gore
plan relies heavily on broadcasters' donating air time _ five
minutes a night for the 30 nights immediately preceding an election
_ to reduce the overall cost of a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Even if contributors gave to the fund, they could still pay for
issue-related commercials for a candidate under the umbrella of
independent expenditures. But Gore's proposal would discourage
commercial broadcasters from accepting these advertisements. For
each second that a commercial runs for one candidate, the station
would have to give matching free air time to both candidates in the
race as a requirement of keeping its broadcast license.
</P>
<P>
   If the fund does not raise the necessary $7.1 billion, the onus
would fall on broadcasters to provide free television and radio
time, as measured in ratings points, to the candidates to make up
the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   The reach of Gore's proposal reflects both the extent to which
he believes special-interest money has corrupted the system and the
extent to which he hopes to cast himself as a legitimate voice of
reform. Those who know him well say he is still smarting from the
smudge that his fund-raising practices in 1996 brought to his Boy
Scout image, and his campaign hopes that this proposal and his
acknowledgment of his flaws will help inoculate him in November.
</P>
<P>
   Gore plans to announce his proposal on a campaign trip to
Milwaukee. There, he is to be joined by Sen. Russell Feingold, the
Wisconsin Democrat who, along with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has
been in the vanguard of the movement to revamp the campaign finance
system to rid it of the corrupting influence of special-interest
donors. Feingold is to endorse Gore's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Neither McCain nor Feingold could be reached on Sunday for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his proposal, Gore plans to tell his audience, at
Marquette University, that his No. 1 legislative priority is to
pass the McCain-Feingold proposal to soft money.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks prepared for delivery, Gore also acknowledges that he
is perhaps an unlikely vessel for reform. ``I understand the doubts
about whether I personally am serious on campaign reform,'' the
prepared remarks say. He goes on to say that in 1996 both Democrats
and Republicans ``engaged in fund-raising that pushed the system to
the breaking point and fueled further cynicism.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds: ``I've got the scars to prove it. And I know I may be
an imperfect messenger for this cause. But the real wounds will be
to our democracy itself unless we address this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   An advocate for overhauling the system, Fred Wertheimer,
president of Democracy 21, a nonpartisan group devoted to public
campaign financing, praised Gore's proposal as ``very creative and
very promising.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are sweeping, broad-based reform proposals and meet the
test of real, fundamental campaign finance reform,'' Wertheimer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wertheimer said, ``The single most important step that
Vice President Gore can take is laying out a detailed operational
plan on what he would immediately do if elected to make this
happen. Spelling out a detailed plan on how he would overcome
Washington's entrenched resistance to campaign finance reform is
the key to his building credibility on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said voters might be skeptical of Mr. Gore's proposal
not just because of his own history in ``pushing the limits,'' as
Gore has acknowledged, but because he and Bill Clinton ran in 1992
on a promise of fixing the campaign system and then ``walked away''
from it. Wertheimer said that Gore needed to start ``building a
national coalition, use the bully pulpit and involve the American
people.''

IDT SAYS LIBERTY MEDIA WILL BUY STAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Exclusive)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Maintaining its drive into the telecommunications industry, John
C. Malone's Liberty Media Group has agreed to invest about $130
million for a stake of almost 10 percent in the IDT Corp., the
communications carrier based in Hackensack, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The companies plan to announce their deal Monday, said Howard S.
Jonas, IDT's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Liberty will buy almost 10 percent of IDT for
$34.50 a share. On Friday, shares of IDT closed at $31.9375, giving
the company a market value of almost $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty's initial investment will be in IDT common stock, but
Jonas said that IDT would have an option in the future to convert
Liberty's stake into shares with subordinate voting rights. Liberty
will be invited to take a seat on IDT's board, Jonas added.
</P>
<P>
   Until AT&AMP;T's acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc. last year,
Liberty was TCI's television programming unit. It still trades as
an AT&AMP;T tracking stock.
</P>
<P>
   But AT&AMP;T holds no financial interest in Liberty, and while
Liberty's far-flung investments are mostly in media and television
programming, over the last year the company has shown interest in
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, TCI's former chairman, who still controls Liberty, has
proved to be a prescient investor, and as digital technology speeds
the convergence of media and communications businesses, Malone is
positioning himself to profit yet again.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, Liberty agreed to acquire the Associated Group for
about $2.8 billion. Among its other interests, Associated was the
biggest shareholder in Teligent Inc., the fast-growing wireless
communications company run by Alex J. Mandl, a former president of
AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Now Liberty is investing in IDT, a scrappy communications
carrier that regularly takes a leading role in creating new
communications niches.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, Jonas and IDT essentially invented the so-called
callback market, which allowed people in many foreign countries to
reduce their rates for international calls by routing the calls
through the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As nations around the world reduced regulations and rates on
international calls, the American-based callback market stagnated.
So a few years ago, IDT became one of the first companies to begin
transmitting phone calls using Internet technology, which can be
cheaper and more efficient than traditional telephone systems.
IDT's Internet calling subsidiary, Net2Phone, now has a market
value of $2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, IDT has started a Spanish-language Internet
service provider and has begun marketing wireless phones that allow
users to avoid charges for incoming calls.
</P>
<P>
   For IDT, an investment from Liberty brings not only cash but
also potential marketing, distribution and product development
relationships with some of the companies in Liberty's portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Jonas said Sunday that IDT's Spanish-language
Internet company could surely find profitable common cause with
Telemundo, the big Spanish-language television network in which
Liberty owns a 50 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malone is like my idol,'' Jonas said Sunday. ``He's probably
the most successful investor in the country, and he has the most
media assets probably of anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonas gave much of the credit for negotiating the deal to Morris
Smith, a former manager of Fidelity Investments' Magellan fund, who
is now IDT's primary financial adviser.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Acting president Vladimir Putin was far ahead in
Russia's presidential election early Monday, narrowly holding the
absolute majority of the popular vote that the Kremlin had pursued
with growing desperation to avoid a runoff next month.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putin's anticlimactic triumph was huge in absolute
terms _ some 20 percentage points ahead of his closest rival, the
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov _ it also appeared likely to fall
considerably short of expectations. And that further elevated
doubts, which had begun to surface in the campaign's final days,
about the depth of Putin's popular support.
</P>
<P>
   With 77.4 percent of the ballots counted at 5 a.m. Moscow time
(8 p.m. EST), Putin had captured 51.5 percent of the vote, compared
with 30.2 percent for Zyuganov. The head of the liberal Yabloko
party, the legislator Grigory Yavlinsky, was in a remote third
place with 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The final pre-election polls, released a week before Sunday's
election, indicated that Putin was backed by as many as 57 per cent
of respondents who said they intended to vote.
</P>
<P>
   In a postmidnight news conference, Putin seemed to give a nod to
the narrowness of his majority, noting that with a potential
electorate of 108 million, ``even a half percentage point is a huge
credit from the population.''
</P>
<P>
   More telling, he seemed to suggest that he might invite
political rivals into government in an apparent effort to build
political support for whatever programs he proposes.
</P>
<P>
   Putin was especially solicitous of Zyuganov, whose support
appeared almost one-fifth greater than pollsters had estimated.
</P>
<P>
   In his news conference, Putin stated with surprising bluntness
that Zyuganov's showing, especially in the face of a relentlessly
hostile government and private press, was a warning that the
Kremlin was not adequately addressing the problems of the working
class and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   He also offered tributes to his bitter rivals, the former prime
minister Yevgeny Primakov and Moscow's mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, saying
that they had helped hold Russia together by supporting the war
against separatist rebels in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they or any other outsiders will be brought to the
Kremlin ``is subject matter for negotiations,'' Putin said. But he
added, in an allusion to a classic Russian fairy tale, that he
would not allow his team to resemble ``the notorious troika, where
one is pulling into the water, another one backwards and the third
one to the clouds.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's intentions may well depend on whether the bare majority
to which he clung in Moscow's predawn survives the counting of the
final ballots. If it does, Putin can accurately claim a mandate
from Russian voters, paper-thin though it might be, to carry out
new policies.
</P>
<P>
   If it does not, the law requires that he face the second-place
finisher, Zyuganov, in a runoff scheduled for April 16.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually no one doubts that Putin would win such a contest
handily; Zyuganov, also the Communist candidate in the 1996
presidential election, could muster only 40 per cent of the vote in
a runoff that year against Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also clear that Putin would emerge from that runoff a
diminished leader, stripped of the image of infallibility and
inevitability that has cloaked him almost since Yeltsin named him
prime minister last August.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, the spare, dour 47-year-old former chief of domestic
intelligence, has captivated the public and utterly confounded
political sages since his vault from near-total obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   No one expected a man unschooled in politics and so bland in
personality and appearance to seize the Russians' imagination. Most
predicted that Putin's first and only action of profound importance
_ the launching of an all-out war on secessionist rebels in the
province of Chechnya _ would be an act of political suicide.
Yeltsin's decision in 1994 to conduct a Chechen war that went
disastrously awry for the Russian army almost cost him the 1996
election and was one cause of his impeachment in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But in both cases Putin confounded the political pundits. His
calm decisiveness, apolitical manner and comparative youth
contrasted favorably with the bombast, Kremlin maneuvering and
indecision of the final years of an increasingly infirm Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   And the second Chechen war turned out to galvanize ordinary
citizens, stung by the loss of Soviet empire and industrial might,
who were looking for some evidence of Russian heft to boost their
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   At times this winter, polls indicated that close to three in
four Russians supported Putin's conduct as prime minister and _
after Yeltsin abruptly quit on New Year's Eve _ as acting
president. His support was so robust that Primakov, once seen as a
formidable opponent for the presidency, quit the race.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last month, some of that support began to fade. The
reason is not completely clear: It may be in part that Putin has
drifted out of the honeymoon phase that is granted new leaders, and
in part that voters began to focus on the election and discovered
other candidates they liked.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``The decline is among those people who like Putin but do not
vote for him,'' said Leonid Sedov, who directs the Public Opinion
Foundation, a major Moscow polling organization. ``They have
nothing against him; they think his policies are quite all right.
But they were going to vote for other persons anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last week of the campaign, during which it was forbidden
to publish opinion polls, Putin's backers launched a furious effort
to recapture some of that support, in part by launching negative
attacks on those politicians who were perceived as siphoning it
away.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the focus was on Yavlinsky. In the final days
of the race, as Putin garnered much media attention by flying a
combat fighter to Chechnya on an ostensibly official visit,
Yavlinsky was investigated by the government on suspicion of
illegally campaigning on a military base.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the state television network ORT, controlled in part
by the financier Boris Berezovsky, who is close to the Kremlin,
broadcast a series of news reports identifying Jews, homosexuals
and foreigners as principal supporters of Yavlinsky.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, Putin's chief campaign strategist denied any
role in those reports, which were clearly designed to stir
smoldering Russian biases against minorities to Yavlinsky's
disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many mysterious and silly things happen during the campaign,''
the strategist, Gleb Pavlovsky, said in an interview on the
privately owned NTV network. ``I know nothing about Yavlinsky's
sexual orientation, and I know nothing about events that take place
in the gay community. If it was staged, it did Putin nothing but
harm.''
</P>
<P>
   Yavlinsky, long regarded as a leader of Russia's Western-style
democrats, said Sunday night that his campaign ``achieved what we
wanted _ we have demonstrated that there are millions of people
behind us who support what we are talking about.'' He indicated
that he hopes to form a broader coalition of right-wing critics of
the Putin government.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear what that coalition might be. Many of
Yavlinsky's ideological allies, such as the Yeltsin government
veterans who comprise the new Union of Right Forces, have cast
their lot with Putin.
</P>
<P>
   In geographic terms, Putin swept every region of the nation. But
he apparently avoided a runoff by piling up votes in European
Russia to offset a comparatively disappointing showing in Siberia
and on the Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
   In vast parts of the less populous east _in the enormous central
Siberian province of Krasnoyarsk, and far eastern regions like
Chukotka and Primoriye _ Putin failed to reach the 50 percent mark.
He also fell well short in the city of Moscow, which gave him only
46.3 percent of the vote and Yavlinsky 18.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But in his hometown of St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest
city, Putin collected more than six of every 10 votes. And in
northwestern provinces like Kaliningrad and Karelia, he did almost
as well.
</P>
<P>
   The election commission stated that some 67 percent of voters
had cast ballots, slightly below the turnout in the nation's first
post-Soviet presidential election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That alleviated one of the Kremlin's secondary concerns: that
unanimous predictions of Putin's victory would depress turnout
below the legally binding level of 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If turnout fell below that floor, a new election would have been
required in four months. Since it did not, Putin will almost
certainly be sworn in, in May, for a full four-year term as
president.

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR SPREWELL, A YEAR HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Latrell Sprewell was laughing Sunday morning,
throwing up crazy shots from halfcourt with Allan Houston after a
light practice at the Rose Garden. The Knicks are always accused of
being so serious and corporate, yet here were their star players
caught up in a shooting game, enjoying their first full day of a
seminal Western Conference road trip.
</P>
<P>
   In more chaotic times, this franchise went West and waited for
calamity to unfold. As for the Knicks' coaches from the mid-1990s
until last season, either Don Nelson was on the firing line or Jeff
Van Gundy was trying to keep his team from imploding.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, it's about defining how we're going to play going
into the playoffs,'' Van Gundy said before the Knicks met the Trail
Blazers Sunday night. ``Last year, that was about surviving.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to recognize Sprewell and the Knicks from last March,
when they went 1-2 during an abbreviated Western swing because of
the lockout, and he was pouting over his sixth-man role and
wondering when Van Gundy would understand what he was about.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell's ability to put his team before himself is one of the
primary reasons the Knicks have a decent shot of returning to the
finals.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just his slashing, scoring and passing. Less than two
weeks ago, his nasty demeanor on the floor inspired the Knicks to
victory in Philadelphia. When Sprewell scowls and grows intense,
the Knicks scowl and grow intense. He is often automatic from the
free-throw line and has developed one of the best left hands in the
game for a right-handed player.
</P>
<P>
   Ambidextrous and sometimes awesome, he is also happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like this is the team I belong on and I feel
comfortable with it,'' he said Sunday. ``I think we've just grown
together. We are definitely more familiar with one another and more
familiar with what we're doing on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   With five mostly grueling games over the next eight days,
anything can happen. But there is a serene quality to these Knicks
now, a feeling that nothing will ruffle them for too long because
they have been through some very difficult times together.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell's '99 Road Trip Out West: he lost his dribble against
Sacramento in the final seconds and inexplicably fouled Jason
Williams, who made the game-clinching free throw; in Phoenix, he
said, ``It's just one of those stats'' when asked how he felt about
his teams being a combined 7-22 with him in the lineup over the
previous two seasons; in Los Angeles, Van Gundy confronted him
after practice, and Sprewell ducked out on reporters who wanted to
ask about that meeting. With the Knicks in disarray, Sprewell
seemed not to care or fit in.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy remembered that meeting, and now understands that he,
too, misread Sprewell's mannerisms and words. ``I think what he
wanted to basically convey was, it wasn't all his fault they lost
out there,'' he said. ``Now, all he talks about is winning. I don't
think he's a stat guy at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy added: ``The other thing I'm impressed with Latrell
about: he never resents other guys' shooting, other guys' playing.
Some of the guys on our team, even though they knew Patrick was
going to be good for our team coming back, they were resentful of
what he might take away from them. Latrell was just the opposite.
He always talked about how good it would be for him and everybody
to have Patrick back.''
</P>
<P>
   How a guy perceived to be a chucker ended up as the Knicks' most
unselfish player is pretty amazing.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell recalls little from that trip, except, ``We were
fighting just to get in, I remember that.'' He also did not see any
grand significance behind returning to Portland for the first time
since February 1998. For more than a week, Sprewell rose before 8
a.m., dressed nattily and attended his arbitration hearing after
assaulting his coach at Golden State, P.J. Carlesimo, which
resulted in a one-year suspension. In some ways, Portland is where
Sprewell's transformation began.
</P>
<P>
   After all the testimony, the arbitrator, John D. Feerick, the
dean of Fordham Law School, sharply reduced Sprewell's suspension
and reinstated his contract. Sprewell began the journey, going from
Most Vilified Sports Figure in America _ sandwiched between Roberto
Alomar and John Rocker _ to Madison Square Garden Fan Favorite in
less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   His ascension continued Sunday night at the Rose Garden. He does
not have to answer any more questions about playing on a losing
team or sit with Van Gundy on a vacant stairwell at Pauley Pavilion
and explain himself. He has done all the hard work. These days,
Latrell Sprewell no longer counts himself among his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's a good challenge for this team,'' he said
when asked about the road trip. ``If we can finish this road trip
strong, we'll prove a lot of things to a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke as if he and the Knicks had not proved a lot. Funny,
no? Sometimes you come so far so fast, you forget where you were a
year ago.

WISCONSIN MADE GRADE SLOWLY, BUT SURELY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TOM SPOUSTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Dick Bennett has spent his 35-year career
coaching basketball in Wisconsin, so he always has felt a personal
stake in his players' sweat and his schools' success. As he
searched the front rows of the Pit for family members after the
Badgers' 64-60 victory over Purdue on Saturday night for a berth in
the Final Four, his emotions were especially poignant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Way to go, Dad!'' Bennett's daughter, Amy Stiever, yelled when
she caught his eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Way to go, Grandpa!'' she added for her young son, Andrew,
whom she held in her arms.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett waved as the celebration swirled around him. He cried as
he cut down the nets from the West Regional championship game. He
had cried during the pregame speech to his team. Bennett wears his
love of Wisconsin for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the pregame speech, he just broke down,'' said the
Badgers assistant coach, Brad Soderberg. ``Tears were running down
his face. I think it finally dawned on him that what he has been
building for 35 years was about to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In his sixth season, Bennett has guided the Badgers (22-13) to
their first Final Four appearance since 1941, doing so with one
senior and four junior starters. None of them were voted to the
first, second or third all-Big Ten teams this season.
</P>
<P>
   Still, eighth-seeded Wisconsin jelled late in the season and
became the lowest-seeded team to reach the Final Four since No. 11
Louisiana State in 1986. It is the first eighth-seeded team to
advance this far in the National Collegiate Athletic Association
men's tournament since Villanova in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that we were worthy of respect until we finished
so strong,'' Bennett said. ``We've gotten our share. People have
been fair to us. I have no complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers have won 10 of their last 13 games, although the
three losses were to Michigan State, their opponent in the national
semifinals next Saturday in Indianapolis. To get there, the Badgers
left four NCAA tournament opponents gasping for air, and not
because the games were played at high altitudes. Instead of defense
by intimidation, Wisconsin plays defense by frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Fresno State Coach Jerry Tarkanian said his team just died
suddenly. Arizona, seeded No. 1 in the West Regional, was
dumbfounded while scoring a season-low 23 points in the first half.
Louisiana State players talked of being stripped of their
competitive intensity. Purdue hit only 39.6 percent of its shots
and had stretches of seven minutes and six minutes without a field
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just determination,'' said guard Mike Kelley, Wisconsin's
senior starter. ``It's all five of us being in the gaps. It just
starts off and gets going and going. We just chase you down until
you don't want to win anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Purdue, Jon Bryant stunned the Boilermakers by making
five of nine shots from 3-point range, including his first three
attempts, in the first half. He finished with 18 points, and Andy
Kowske had 14 points and 8 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Bryant, a junior guard who made 18 of 36 shots from long
range in the tournament, symbolizes the tenacious player that fits
Bennett's coaching style. While at Division II St. Cloud State in
Minnesota, Bryant hounded Bennett on the phone for a chance to play
for the Badgers, and he transferred to Wisconsin without a
guarantee of a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He demands the best out of everybody,'' Bryant said of
Bennett. ``He really believes if you do that, if you believe in the
system and good defense, it'll pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said: ``Wisconsin is not a place where a lot of big-time
recruiters come. It's not a gold mine for talent. But if you can
find the Kelleys and the Kowskes and the Bryants, you will never be
embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett has won at every level, coaching high school teams for
11 years, at Wisconsin-Stevens Point for nine and at
Wisconsin-Green Bay for 10, before taking over the Badgers in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Although his teams were successful, it was Bennett's
disciplined, slow-paced system that caught attention. Two seasons
ago, a Sports Illustrated poll asked 115 college coaches, ``If you
could go to one clinic, whose would it be?'' Bennett tied for third
with Indiana's Bob Knight behind Duke's Mike Krzyzewski and Utah's
Rick Majerus.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of fans are addicted to highlight reels,'' Kelley said.
``It's the basketball purist who appreciates us. It's not pretty,
but Coach Bennett's system works.''

<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ Advantage, Tiger Woods?
</P>
<P>
   Not really. You can't say that when Woods is three shots down to
Hal Sutton in the rain-delayed final round of The Players
Championship, which will resume at 9 a.m. today with seven holes to
play.
</P>
<P>
   You can't even say it because Woods, with 10 wins in his past 16
PGA Tour events, overcame a seven-shot deficit with seven holes to
play to win at Pebble Beach in January.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is certain. A day to regroup can do nothing but
help Woods, who Sunday seemed on his way to being defeated by the
consistent Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, things aren't going exactly the way I wanted, but
I'm right there and I've got a good chance of winning right now,''
Woods said. ``Now the conditions are going to be a little different
_ tomorrow, fresh start.''
</P>
<P>
   With a comment perhaps directed at Sutton's triple-bogey 6 at
the island green 17th Saturday, Woods said, ``We'll see what
happens. There's a lot of water to be played over.''
</P>
<P>
   The tournament was halted by a thunderstorm late Sunday
afternoon with 20 players yet to finish. Woods is on the front of
the 12th green, facing a putt of about 40 feet. Sutton, who won the
1983 Players Championship on a Monday finish, has an 82-yard sand
wedge awaiting to the 12th green.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I would have liked to have kept playing,'' said
Sutton, who's at 10-under par. ``But it was a dangerous (lightning)
situation. I like living better than I do finishing the golf
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the psychological change with today's continuation, Sutton
admitted, ``I felt like we were familiar with what everything was
doing at the time _ the firmness of the greens, the speed of the
greens. We're going to have to come out and regroup and think about
other things tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it's clearly a two-man race now _ the four players on
the course tied for third are three shots behind Woods _ Sutton
labeled the TPC at Sawgrass as his true opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a Tiger Woods-Hal Sutton duel,'' Sutton said.
``You can make it out to be what you want it to be. But the fact
is, I'm playing the golf course out there.''

THE NETS SQUANDER A BIG LEAD, AND PROBABLY A PLAYOFF BERTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ A Nets' season laden with
disappointment, misfortune and horrible play at the most crucial
times hit the point of near hopelessness Sunday at the Continental
Arena. With their scant playoff chances demanding a victory, the
Nets fell into a fourth-quarter haze and surrendered an 18-point
lead with less than 9 minutes to play in losing to the lowly Denver
Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   Playing without its star player, Antonio McDyess, the Nuggets,
whose 28-42 record long ago eliminated them from Western Conference
playoff contention, displayed more heart and more desire than the
Nets. When it would have been natural for the going-nowhere Nuggets
to coast through the closing minutes and the still-alive Nets to
sprint through the finish, the Nets all but quit on themselves,
their coach and their postseason aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Outscored by 31-11 over the final 8 minutes 6 seconds, the Nets
lost, 112-110, before 15,825 stunned fans when the former Net,
Chris Gatling, caught a rebound and put in a 5-footer all in one
motion with 6.5 seconds remaining. Terrible all season long in
their late-game execution, the Nets stayed the course on the final
play when Scott Burrell threw an inbounds pass off of Keon Clark's
leg, sending the ball rolling toward the Nets bench as the final
seconds ticked away.
</P>
<P>
   The incomprehensible loss was the eighth time the Nets (29-40)
have lost a game they led by more than 10 points, and it left them
with only the faintest possibility of qualifying for the Eastern
Conference playoffs. With 13 games remaining, they are five games
behind the Orlando Magic, which holds the eighth and final spot
with a 35-36 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a loss, as I just told the players, that there is no
defending,'' Nets Coach Don Casey said. ``It was terrible play at
critical times. They kept their heads up, and we were moping. We
had guys moping for whatever the reason. I don't really know at
this time. Maybe it's the pressure or whatever, but this was a
killer game and we did not respond to it. We got very cool with the
lead when it was time to do things and I don't have an answer for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was a microcosm of the Nets' forgettable season in
which they lost 13 of their first 15 games. They rebounded to
overcome the awful start and gave themselves a chance to make the
playoffs, and now have folded with the pressure on. Just two games
behind Orlando after upsetting Toronto on Tuesday, the Nets have
lost their last three games, all of which included inexplicable
periods of sluggishness.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon, knowing that Orlando had beaten Miami by 25
points, the Nets somehow began as if uninterested. Lethargic and
perhaps indulging in self pity after controversial officiating
contributed to Friday's 1-point overtime loss to Minnesota, the
Nets fell behind by 31-13 eight minutes into the game. Nick Van
Exel, whom Stephon Marbury held to just 2 points in a Nets victory
on March 1, shot with a vengeance, hitting 6 of 7 attempts in
scoring 14 first-quarter points.
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel would continue to outplay Marbury (16 points, 11
assists, 5 of 16 shooting) throughout and finish with 28 points and
12 assists. Raef LaFrentz did the same number on Keith Van Horn,
opening the game with 12 points and 7 rebounds in the first
quarter. He finished with 22 points and 18 rebounds as one of four
Nuggets to score 20 or more points. Gatling had 20 points and 7
rebounds, and rookie James Posey scored 21.
</P>
<P>
   McDyess, who was limited to just 14 minutes because of a
sprained left ankle, contributed just 4 points and 4 rebounds
before leaving for good in the third quarter. Casey inserted his
reserves, the vaunted ``Rottweilers,'' and they lived up to their
billing, rallying the Nets to pull within 60-56 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Newman, who socred 20 points to share team honors with
Van Horn, led the bench unit with 13 points in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The starters picked up the momentum and, behind 11 points from
Kerry Kittles, broke it open, going ahead by 85-75 late in the
third quarter. Burrell hit two quick 3-pointers early in the fourth
and then put the Nets ahead by 99-81 with 8:36 left with a
21-footer.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the Nets began to cruise. ``We started to coast,''
Marbury said. ``We got relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets caught their attention by draining three straight
3-pointers in 58 seconds to cut a 101-86 deficit to 101-95 with
5:14 to play. Casey called a timeout, but by then Denver, which
made 6 of 11 3-pointers in the fourth, was rolling. The Nets lead
disappeared quickly, with Posey putting the Nuggets up, 107-106, on
a 3-pointer with 2:10 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets regained the lead on two free throws by Marbury, but
Gatling converted a 3-point play. Burrell tied at 110-110 with a
tip-in with 6 seconds left. The Nuggets then inbounded the ball to
Gatling, who missed a shot off the glass before catching George
McCloud's tap in midair and scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gatling told us before the game that he was the mayor of East
Rutherford, or wherever we are, so I figured the mayor ought to
take the last shot,'' Denver Coach Dan Issel said.
</P>
<P>
   Gatling, an Irvington, N.J., native, was more than happy to bury
his former team's playoff hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's great,'' Gatling said. ``Anything I can do to help.''

SUTTON OUTDUELS WOODS BEFORE RAIN GETS IN THE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ Hal Sutton's biggest problem Sunday
was not Tiger Woods. It was the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning, followed by heavy rain, forced the final round of the
Players Championship to be suspended until Monday at 9 a.m.
Eastern, with Sutton holding a three-stroke lead over Woods through
11 holes. Sutton was 10 under par, Woods was 7 under, while five
players were tied at 4 under par, all stuck in a holding pattern
until play resumes.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension was a potentially bad break for Sutton, who felt
like a boxer poised to take charge of a fight, only to hear the
bell. Though Woods has plenty of time to make another dramatic
comeback, Sutton had the momentum when play was halted.
</P>
<P>
   No. 10 was a turning point: Sutton made a 30-foot putt for
birdie from the fringe of the green, then Woods missed a 6-foot
attempt for birdie. Instead of gaining a stroke at the hole, Woods
lost another stroke, leaving him three behind with seven holes to
play and with Sutton playing steady golf.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price was the only player at four under par who finished.
The others at four under were Jeff Maggert (through 17 holes),
Colin Montgomerie (14 holes), Lee Janzen (13 holes), and Tom Lehman
(12 holes.
</P>
<P>
   The horn blew at 4:45 p.m. local (Eastern) time as Sutton stood
in the middle of the 12th fairway with a perplexed look on his
face.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton could be on the verge of capturing a prestigious
tournament, the biggest first-place check in golf ($1.08 million),
and a head-to-head victory over Woods. However, instead of
celebrating tonight as he had hoped, Sutton was forced to sleep
with the lead, knowing there would be seven difficult holes left to
finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I would have liked to have kept playing, but it was
a dangerous situation, good that they called it,'' said Sutton, who
won the Players Championship in 1983 on a Monday after a rain
delay. ``Everything was going the way I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods will have catching up to do, after an abbreviated round in
which he was not at his best. Starting the day one stroke behind
Sutton, Woods pulled even with a birdie on the first hole, but that
was his only birdie of the day, and he was one over par through 11
holes. Woods made back-to-back bogeys at Nos. 3 and 4 to fall two
strokes behind.
</P>
<P>
   At the par-3 No. 3, Woods hit a poor tee shot into a bunker,
then failed to get up and down. At the par-4 No. 4, Woods missed
the green long on his second shot, then flubbed a chip shot from
the green when his ball was smothered by the deep grass. The chip
shot traveled only a few feet, landing on the fringe of the green
as the crowd groaned. Woods then missed a 20-foot chip shot for
par, forcing him to tap-in for bogey. Those mistakes, capped by his
missed putt at No. 11, left Woods needing a Monday rally.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he was far from despondent. After all, Woods has come back
on a Monday before, most spectacularly at Pebble Beach last month,
when he rallied from a seven-stroke deficit with seven holes to
play. And at the T.P.C. at Sawgrass, which presents one of golf's
most challenging finishes, including the treacherous island green
at No. 17, almost anything can happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, things aren't going exactly the way I wanted,''
said Woods, smiling. ``But I've got a pretty good chance of
winning. There is a lot of water to be played over. If there is any
kind of golf course you want to play when you are behind, it is one
of these, with a lot of water and a lot of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had an extra lucky red shirt for Monday, Woods said.
``I do, actually. Or a lot of cologne.''
</P>
<P>
   When play resumes, Sutton will have an approach shot from 82
yards at the par-4 No. 12, while Woods was already on the green in
two shots, but facing a difficult putt from 40 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, who played par golf for the first 10 holes before making
his key birdie at No. 11, was the steadier player Sunday, and he
could have led by more if he had not missed four birdie putts from
12 feet or less on his first four holes. Sutton also made a crucial
par save at the par-4 No. 8, after hitting his second shot into a
bunker. Facing a difficult stance on a hill, squatting low over his
ball, Sutton hit a beautiful bunker shot with spin that landed
softly on the green, 10 feet past the hole. Then Sutton completed
the save by making the putt, pumping his fist as the ball
disappeared into the cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was big,'' Sutton said of his bunker shot. ``If I hadn't
gotten that up and down, that would have given him momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton's birdie putt at No. 11 was an unexpected bonus, coming
after a chip shot that rolled back toward him after failing to
clear a mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't ready for that,'' Sutton said of making his putt at
No. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Neither was Woods, who missed his 6-footer after the roar from
the crowd subsided. ``Making that putt in front of him makes that
putt a whole lot harder,'' Sutton said.
</P>
<P>
   So on Monday, Sutton hoped to finish what he started.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finished on Monday the year I won,'' Sutton said. ``I don't
know if that has anything to do with anything. But it was nice to
think about.'' &QL;

KINGDOME, MEMORIES COME CRASHING DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT L. JAMIESON JR.  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In a flurry of flashes and booms, the Kingdome _ a
storehouse of sports moments and cultural memories for more than
two decades _ rumbled to the ground Sunday in 16.8 spectacular
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   More than 4,450 pounds of dynamite, unleashed over a span of
tiny delays, blitzed one of the world's largest concrete domes _
one day shy of its 24th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Licensed blaster Thom Doud pushed a button, igniting 21.6 miles
of detonation cord. The stadium's roof arches pulsed like holiday
lights, and a burst of explosives echoed. The building groaned.
Then, suddenly, the Kingdome buckled to the one force it had defied
for years _ gravity.
</P>
<P>
   The 25,000-ton concrete roof crashed down, shooting a cloud of
fine white dust into a blue sky. People watched in awe from
downtown streets and from flotillas of boats in Elliott Bay.
</P>
<P>
   In Pioneer Square, they raised their arms and cheered _ until,
suddenly, the dust cloud _ more than 500 feet high _ sent people
scrambling like extras in the Blob movie.
</P>
<P>
   But some people reveled in the dust. They pulled out scuba and
gas masks and watched it settle. ``It's amazing how something with
so much history can disappear so quickly,'' explained Brina Sanft,
a local musician. ``I just want to grab a piece of it and hold onto
it forever.''
</P>
<P>
   After 20 minutes, the dust cloud thinned, revealing the fate of
the stadium that had been pared in recent weeks: It had become a
sunken souffle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roof did its job, the gravity engine worked. It provided
the energy we needed to pull the columns inward,'' said Mark
Loizeaux, president of Controlled Demolition Inc., the
Maryland-based company whose handiwork brought down the Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demolition went perfectly,'' said Tom Gerlach of Turner
Construction Co., which is building a new football and soccer
stadium on the site. ``The relief is palpable.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the blast, crews began work to crunch and haul
concrete at the site. Meanwhile, in neighborhoods, phalanxes of
street cleaners began to clear dust while other crews checked for
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle fire and police reported no major injuries. Authorities,
however, reported scattered incidents of broken windows.
</P>
<P>
   The blast changed history.
</P>
<P>
   Gone was the place where people had seen their first Mariners
game or Rolling Stones concert; gone was the place visitors had met
a future spouse or sealed a friendship; gone was a piece of
Seattle's skyline, a symbol _ along with Mount Rainier and the
Space Needle _ that defined a mossy corner of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the few times we've watched the same building
go up in our lifetime and come down in our lifetime,'' said Larry
Kreisman, an architectural historian for the Seattle Landmarks
Preservation Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kingdome was prominent. It always had people's attention.
They may have liked it. They may have disliked it. But it was
always in their eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of spectators, defying suggestions to watch the
implosion at home on television, crowded downtown streets and
searched for elevated lookouts with prime views of the stadium's
collapse. The implosion of a building that means so much to so many
was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
</P>
<P>
   On the 28th floor of the Smith Tower, 2-year-old Wyatt James
Kendall shrank from the window and sank into his dad's shoulder
when the blast touched off.
</P>
<P>
   Smith Tower rumbled and swayed slightly, and the implosion set
off a fire alarm.
</P>
<P>
   People applauded the Kingdome's last show. But some, such as
Mark and Elaine Dale of West Seattle, admitted a bit of sadness.
``I look at it as a funeral,'' said Mark Dale. ``It's part of the
skyline. It's kind of ugly, but it's like the ugly cousin you've
always liked.''
</P>
<P>
   At a park behind Harborview Medical Center, Maille Kessenich,
who spent the night to get a good view, said, ``I guess we should
be a little sad. But we're not. Destruction's cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Sunday's spectacle, regular life in Seattle
sustained minor disruptions: Major highways, such as Interstates 5
and 90, were closed or had traffic slowed; the city imposed a wide
restriction area for south downtown, and traffic detours re-routed
Metro buses.
</P>
<P>
   But far fewer people than expected clogged roadways or tried to
gather downtown, transit and fire officials said. And most major
roadways were back to normal within 45 minutes of the implosion.
</P>
<P>
   The event was broadcast live on Seattle's three major network
affiliates, beamed across the Internet and shown in New York's
Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   The founder of Controlled Demolition Inc., Jack Loizeaux, whose
sons conducted the implosion, did not want to miss the spectacle.
He called the Kingdome a feat of engineering.
</P>
<P>
   A key engineer behind the Kingdome's design was the late John
Skilling, who had a hand in designing New York's World Trade
Center. Another top engineer for the Kingdome, Jack Christiansen,
was devastated by the implosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me sick,'' said Christiansen, who once stood on the
Kingdome's roof to prove the stadium would not, as some had
claimed, fall down. ``Such a sad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the stadium's demise was sealed by forces that
helped to create it: economics. In the 1960s, when the idea began
to gather steam, people envisioned it as a way to put Seattle on
the map.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, local planners believed a new stadium would dovetail
with economic growth and civic enhancement _ future-looking themes
that were cornerstones of the 1962 World's Fair in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a 1968 effort called Forward Thrust, voters passed a
$40 million bond. Later, following much debate, plans went ahead to
put the stadium near the King Street train station.
</P>
<P>
   Ground was broken in 1972, and more than three years later, when
construction ended, the stadium's price tag had reached $67
million. That, however, could not dampen the public's enthusiasm _
more than 54,000 people showed up for the Dome's inaugural program
in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday former Gov. John Spellman, who helped shepherd the Dome
as King County executive from the late 1960s to early 1980s,
refused to watch the implosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be like going to a family member's autopsy,'' said
Spellman.
</P>
<P>
   But the implosion attracted the attention of the world, for
various reasons. ``People see a building that has been around for a
long time. It amazes them that something so permanent can turn to
rubble in seconds,'' said Doug Loizeaux, CDI's vice president. He
added that he thought some people would watch in anticipation for
something to go awry.
</P>
<P>
   But, the implosion was picture perfect.
</P>
<P>
   The acupuncture-like placement of explosives in 5,905 holes
turned the 250-foot Kingdome mountain into molehills of slab.
</P>
<P>
   The blast crews approached the Kingdome with healthy respect for
its engineering. The stadium had to be strong enough to withstand
an earthquake in a seismically active region such as the Puget
Sound area.
</P>
<P>
   But it also had to be flexible enough to handle the motion
created by the Earth or the shuffling of the more than 73 million
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The construction was a marvel.
</P>
<P>
   A tension ring, at the base of roof, packed 8 million pounds of
pressure; and support columns, threaded with rebar, gave the
building the equivalent of strong bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mind stretcher,'' said Mark Loizeaux. After he won the
contract to implode the Kingdome last year, he drove his rental car
to the stadium's parking lot and stared at it for four hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Dome also was in the public eye because of money; the county
still must pay $206 million for the Kingdome _ costs accrued from
interest on original construction bonds, and for roof and ceiling
repairs from five years ago. (The money, which will be paid by
2016, will come from a hotel tax and car-rental tax.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a one-of-a kind situation,'' said Kreisman, the
architectural historian. ``Here it is, we are destroying something,
and it isn't even paid off!''
</P>
<P>
   But as sports economists have observed across the country, old
multi-purpose stadiums do not generate as much money as one-event
stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who owns the Seahawks, knew
that a healthy portion of a team's money comes from stadium
revenue, including money from premium seats and luxury boxes. But
the future at the Dome looked bleak.
</P>
<P>
   The overall Kingdome demolition will cost $9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Implosion was preferable to a wrecking ball and crane because of
the stadium's complex structure.
</P>
<P>
   The crane method would have exposed workers to greater danger
and exposed the Pioneer Square area to dust and noise for at least
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is implosion faster, but it also shows respect for old
buildings, Loizeaux said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than beat them down for a long time, you knock them out
swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday CDI did just that. The Kingdome _ an old friend who
meant so much to so many _ was blasted into memory.

   JERUSALEM _ With 86 shuffling steps, Pope John Paul II on Sunday
approached the Western Wall, reached out a trembling hand to touch
its cool stone, and as is the custom of Jewish visitors, tucked
into a crevice a heartfelt note to God. Then he made a fluid sign
of the cross at the most sacred site in Judaism, and a hush
carpeted the plaza.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's note bore the message of reconciliation that has been
the public theme of his six-day personal pilgrimage, which
concluded peacefully Sunday as he moved from the Al-Aqsa Mosque to
the wall and then to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. Traveling in
an armored jeeplike vehicle with heavy security, he linked with his
presence the nerve centers of the three Abrahamic faiths that
consider Jerusalem holy and reluctantly share the walled Old City
in its heart.
</P>
<P>
   But the interfaith link was a tenuous one. And it wavered even
before the pope flew off Sunday evening, visibly moved by his
journey along Jesus' footsteps, though the path traversed a Holy
Land mined with religious and political sensitivities. Having made
a mark on a place that does not impress easily, the pope left
behind the tensions _ and an open white sheet of paper that stood
out among the hundreds of folded slips wedged into the Western
Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``God of our fathers, you chose Abraham and his descendants to
bring your name to the nations,'' said the note, in English, which
was later moved to the Holocaust museum to be preserved. ``We are
deeply saddened by the behavior of those who in the course of
history have caused these children of yours to suffer. And asking
your forgiveness, we wish to commit ourselves to genuine
brotherhood with the people of the covenant. Jerusalem, 26.3.2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joannes Paulus II.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope's message created a document for Israel. It was taken
from his prayer at a Mass this month at St. Peter's Basilica in
which the pope apologized for the historic sins of the Roman
Catholic Church. ``A 2,000-year-old account is now closed!'' said
Binyamin Ben- Eliezer, the Communications Minister.
</P>
<P>
   Hovering above the Old City, in the blue sky of a brilliant
Sunday, was a red, white, green and black Palestinian flag,
accompanied by scores of similarly colored balloons. The flag
disappeared and reappeared to flutter above the pope as his white
jeep bumped along the Via Dolorosa to the Church of the Holy
Sepulcher.
</P>
<P>
   From Jerusalem to Bethlehem to Nazareth and back, the pope, 79
and frail, has kept up a grueling schedule during the long-awaited
trip that many describe as an apex of his 21-year papacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is unsteady on his feet and he appears weak, but this has
probably been the strongest moment of his pontificate,'' Cardinal
Adam Joseph Maida of Detroit, a friend of the pope's, said Sunday
as the visit was drawing to a close.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis and Palestinians have been touched by the pope's
determination and balanced compassion as he progressed on his cane,
obviously with great physical difficulty, from place to place and
people to people.
</P>
<P>
   As they waited for the pope to board an El Al plane called
Jerusalem, Vatican officials declared the trip a success because
the pope acted and spoke from genuine, deep-seated convictions.
``The pope told everyone the truth without humiliating anyone,''
said Joaquin Navarro-Vals, the Vatican spokesman. ``He said what he
truly felt, and this was respected.''
</P>
<P>
   Vatican officials, who began the trip anxious about their
relationship with Israel, left feeling a stronger bond. They were
impressed by Prime Minister Ehud Barak, an official said _ by what
they considered the gracious and uplifting speech he gave at the
Holocaust memorial and by the way his government turned the other
cheek to Palestinian provocations.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Palestinians, whose cause they support,
somewhat disappointed them by failing to take advantage of the
worldwide platform they were afforded by the pope's visit. Vatican
officials were unnerved by the outbreak of violence among
Palestinians after the pope left a refugee camp on Wednesday and by
the strident political advocacy of Islamic clerics, one of whom
wagged his finger in the pope's face Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's itinerary, with its many sensitive stops, had the
potential to sabotage a successful trip in which the pope has
remained above the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem _ its sanctity, its sovereignty and its complexity _
moved front and center, and the pope's first stop was at the
Al-Aqsa mosque, the domain of the mufti, the city's chief Islamic
cleric.
</P>
<P>
   The pope inched out of the car onto a three-step riser covered
with worn carpeting. He followed other carpets, stamping down bumps
with his cane, into a small stone building beside the Dome of the
Rock. Before he entered, Muhammad Said Al Jamal, an elderly,
bearded imam, pressed a letter into the pope's hands and preached
to him, quite heatedly, about Palestinian rights.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the meeting, the pope did not know that the mufti,
Sheik Ikrima Sabri, had given several interviews over the weekend
filled with incendiary hostility toward Israel that minimized the
enormity of the Holocaust, said Navarro-Valls.
</P>
<P>
   The pope had hoped to have a conversation with the Muslim
leaders. Instead, the mufti read a speech in Arabic, which was then
translated into English by an assistant. Pointing out the window at
the gilded Dome, the mufti instructed the pope that Jerusalem is
``eternally bonded to Islam.'' He also cataloged grievances about
the Israelis, ending with a demand that the pope ``stand by justice
in order to end the Israeli occupation of Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope responded that he considered Jerusalem ``a part of the
common patrimony'' of Christianity, Islam and Judaism _ ``the holy
city par excellence.'' He did not verbally endorse Palestinian
claims to Jerusalem, but Palestinian officials later said that the
visit itself made it clear that Jerusalem is a divided city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope came to help us,'' said Faisal Husseini, the senior
Palestine Liberation Organization official in Jerusalem. ``We hope
that in Jerusalem, we can build two capitals in one open city.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to make the Palestinians' point about the occupation, the
Dome of the Rock compound was ringed by scores of blue-uniformed
Israeli soldiers, who clearly made the Muslims tense _ especially
those who were kept out.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the pope left, the tension erupted, when Muslim
youths poured into the esplanade. Some shouted at the police,
``Jews, the army of Muhammad will come back.'' Others started
throwing pebbles and water, some at Husseini, accusing him of
``giving the keys of Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa to the pope.'' After
much shoving, the scuffle broke up.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the pope had arrived at the wall, which Tzip
Zwick, 13, her braces shining in the sun, said was an affront to
the Jewish people. ``I feel that he has no right to be here,'' said
Miss Zwick, an Orthodox Jewish girl from Brooklyn, N.Y. ``This is a
special place for the Jews.'' She pointed to the women who faced
the wall with their noses pressed into prayer books and to the men
covered with fringed shawls who swayed and murmured.
</P>
<P>
   Official Israel disagreed. Rabbi Michael Melchior, an Israeli
Cabinet minister, walked the pope to the wall with a protective
hand ready to steady his gait. Earlier, the rabbi's voice had
boomed triumphantly across the plaza, calling for ``a new era in
which we commit ourselves to end the manipulation of the sanctity
of Jerusalem for political gain.'' But he also claimed Jerusalem as
the ``eternal capital'' of the Jews.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One after the other, Melchior, in Hebrew, and then the pope, in
Latin, read Psalm 122, an ode to peace in Jerusalem. Melchior said
the Jewish-Catholic reconciliation had been difficult for both
sides, ``which is why it took 52 years for this to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult for them theologically, and it's difficult for
us psychologically,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the ceremony progressed, most of the Jewish visitors to the
wall stopped praying and watched, hemmed in by security officers.
One young man, who shouted out in Hebrew, ``Jews, Jews, my family
was killed in Europe,'' was quickly hauled away by the police. The
police detained seven Jews and three Palestinians for disrupting or
planning disruptions of the visit, Israeli radio said.
</P>
<P>
   Like everything else here, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher is
riven. Three major Christian rites and several other denominations
share it. But the strife was quieted for the day as the sects
postponed their individual services to allow the pope to celebrate
Mass in what he called ``the mother of all churches.'' It stands on
what are venerated as the sites of Jesus' crucifixion, burial and
resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   Greeted by Syrian Orthodox clergymen wearing red Fez hats,
gold-embroidered tunics and ceremonial swords, John Paul was led to
the pink slab where tradition says that Jesus was prepared for
burial. Assisted, the pope sank to his knees and kissed it, lifting
from its marble surface a face lost in reverie.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he delayed his departure from the Holy Land so that he
could return to the Holy Sepulcher to pray once more before
leaving. ``The message of the Gospel takes on flesh and blood when
you come to these places,'' Maida said. The pope is ``a mystic and
very spiritual man _ the pilgrimage has brought this out like never
before.''

PEACEFUL MARCH PROTESTS BIOTECHNOLOGY MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAPHAEL LEWIS AND JAMAL E. WATSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Despite fears of violence in the streets, an estimated
2,500 chanting, costumed demonstrators kept their promise to march
peacefully through Boston on Sunday as they voiced their opposition
to the spread of biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   Police reported no arrests. Protesters dressed as mutant
creatures and macabre vegetables marched along five blocks. The
demonstration capped three days of a counter-conference staged in
the shadow of Bio2000, a biotechnology convention.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of ``Biodevastation 2000'' Sunday said the march, and
the three-hour rally in Copley Square that preceded it, offered
proof that the fledgling movement is catching up with those in
Europe, where protesters have forced governments to rethink the
sale of genetically modified foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``This went about as well as we could have possibly hoped,''
said Jessica Hayes, one of the rally's organizers, who noted that
about 400 protesters greeted members of the biotechnology industry
when they met last May in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   But if the ranks of the opponents of biotechnology are swelling,
they are well behind the sustained growth the industry itself is
enjoying. Bio2000, which runs through Thursday, has drawn nearly
8,000 scientists, researchers, and executives from around the world
to discuss the latest innovations in gene-splicing and
cross-species transplants. The industry last year had $18.6 billion
in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   While the protesters chanted, danced, and drummed, convention
delegates peered down from windows in the Hynes, many wondering
what the fuss was about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a festive, colorful gathering, and I'm glad
that it's been peaceful so far. However, their message was muddled,
and they had so much misinformation,'' said Carl B. Feldbaum,
president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization, which is
sponsoring the conference.
</P>
<P>
   One industry leader was not so charitable in his assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just garbage, unreal garbage,'' said David Dennis,
president of Performance Plants of Kingston, Ontario, moments after
he engaged one of Biodevastation 2000's leaders in a spontaneous
debate. ``These are the most tested products in history. These
people have no idea what they are talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes and other leaders of Biodevastation 2000 Sunday challenged
those at Bio2000 to a public debate on the scientific, moral, and
economic basis for their work.
</P>
<P>
   Such a discussion is not likely to occur, however, since
industry representatives said they had requested a private forum to
set the ground rules of a public debate, something the protesters
rejected, according to Janice Bourque, executive director of the
Massachusetts Biotechnology Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we move forward, we could hopefully have a chance to talk
about our viewpoints; that's still our goal,'' Bourque said.
``Unfortunately, the timing is such that it's not practical to
organize something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The rally began as people dressed as freakish half-tomato,
half-fish mutants, among other creatures, arrived at Copley Square.
They were met by squads of police on foot, on horseback, on
motorcycles, and in cruisers. Officers also kept an eye on the
day's events from a helicopter and from the rooftops of several
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Under brilliant blue skies and warm temperatures, those who
planned on taking part in the protest _ which had a permit for
1,000 people _ were soon joined by numerous bystanders taken up by
the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took some of their literature to find out what all this is
about,'' said Johnny Durant, 50, of Boston. ``It's real
interesting, so I'm going to walk with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Biodevastation 2000 organizers were upset when a group calling
itself the Church of Euthanasia from Somerville arrived with
placards and signs advocating positions far from their own. A few
shoving matches broke out, as well as several arguments. In the
end, the group relocated to the periphery of Copley Square.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said they were grateful to the rally's
organizers for keeping their promise to stage a peaceful protest.
But they said they would remain vigilant, monitoring other planned
protests.

ZUBER FINALLY SEES THE LIGHT AT END OF YANKS' DEPTH CHART 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Jon Zuber turned at his locker to find
himself surrounded by reporters Sunday, and a shy smile conquered
his face before he looked down. If he had been 3 years old instead
of 30, he might have ducked behind the leg of his mother or father.
</P>
<P>
   Zuber has been hidden most of spring, buried on the Yankees'
depth chart behind Darryl Strawberry and Tim Raines when spring
training began. But Zuber, a left-handed hitting first baseman with
only 136 major league at-bats, keeps hitting _ he had three hits
and four runs batted in in a 12-5 thrashing of Minnesota here
Sunday _ and surviving rounds of roster cuts, and now he is
fighting off thoughts that he might make the opening day roster.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Yarnall, projected as the Yankees' fifth starter to start the
season, almost assuredly will not be, after another poor outing
Sunday. Short on stuff and command again, Yarnall needed 43 pitches
to get through the first inning and in three and a third innings of
work he permitted seven hits, two walks and four runs. ``He wasn't
very good,'' Yankees Manager Joe Torre said. ``He just seems
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   There may never be any significant impact from Yarnall's crisis
of confidence this spring. Ramiro Mendoza is expected to open the
season as the fifth starter, and the Yankees will not need a fifth
starter again until April 27, giving Yarnall about a month to sort
out his trouble with the Columbus Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Zuber might also be with Columbus, but he is batting .400 in 18
games and might benefit from the Yankees' struggles to find a
suitable backup catcher. They had hoped Tom Pagnozzi, formerly of
the St. Louis Cardinals, would play well enough on defense to serve
as the backup to Jorge Posada. But while Pagnozzi's hitting and
ability to throw to second base have been better than expected, he
has had more basic problems in camp, dropping pitches and flipping
the ball uncomfortably back to the pitcher after each delivery,
rather than firing it.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Turner has some big league experience and is 6 for 11
(.545) with three extra-base hits. He would not really add anything
to the Yankees' bench, however _ not power or speed _ and he is a
right-handed hitter when the Yankees are searching for a
left-handed hitter. Torre said Sunday that Pagnozzi and Turner are
running neck and neck and have both shown enough to make the team.
Without either standing out, however, the Yankees are considering
another option _ employing Jim Leyritz as the backup catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz came up as a catcher and has plenty of experience, but
this would be a radical departure from the Yankees' off-season
plans: Leyritz was not even considered as a fill-in for Posada when
spring training began.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz has looked OK as a catcher this spring, which is all the
Yankees really need, with Posada likely to catch all but 25 or 30
games in the 162-game schedule. If the Yankees team Leyritz with
Andy Pettitte, a left-handed pitcher with a great pickoff move,
then Leyritz's subpar throwing arm would not be as much of a
factor.
</P>
<P>
   If Leyritz is the backup catcher, then the Yankees can use the
roster spot that would have gone to Pagnozzi or Turner and keep a
more versatile player, like the left-handed hitting Zuber. Ricky
Ledee is likely to be the every day left fielder, spelled
occasionally by the right-handed hitting Roberto Kelly or the
right-handed hitting Shane Spencer, and Spencer will be the
designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   But since the suspension of Strawberry, the Yankees really have
not had a left-handed hitter on the major league roster who might
share time as the designated hitter. That is where Zuber comes into
the picture, much to his own surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Zuber spent his first eight seasons in the Philadelphia
organization, playing parts of two seasons in the majors. He is
what is often referred to as a ``professional'' hitter _ he is
patient and puts the ball in play against all types of pitchers,
but does not hit for power. When he signed with the Yankees in
January, he admitted, he had no dreams of starting the season with
them; he hoped only that he might impress them over time and
perhaps earn a promotion during the regular season if a hole
developed.
</P>
<P>
   Zuber felt comfortable immediately once spring training began,
surprised when Bernie Williams and Derek Jeter would say hi _
``how's it going, Zubes'' _ because there had always been distinct
lines that were not crossed in the Phillies' caste system of
veterans. He was a journeyman, and journeyman did not speak with
the older players.
</P>
<P>
   But he is at ease with the Yankees. He began to chat with Don
Mattingly, the former Yankees' player who worked as a
spring-training coach this year, gleaning some advice and writing
it down on a piece of paper at home. ``Some things about hitting,''
Zuber said.
</P>
<P>
   And now he is applying his knowledge. In the first inning
Sunday, he fell behind the Twins' LaTroy Hawkins, no balls and two
strikes, fouled off a couple of pitches and ran the count to full,
before driving a ball between the outfielders in center and right;
three runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   Zuber also added a couple of singles. ``He's making a case for
himself,'' Torre said. ``He has quality at-bats, whether it's a
left-hander or a right-hander.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have other options as well. They could make a deal
to acquire another player, pick up somebody dropped by another team
in this last week of spring training. They could keep Zuber as a
left-handed complement to Spencer.
</P>
<P>
   Zuber does not want to think about it. He said that Shannon, his
wife, tries not to get too excited about the possibility of him
making the team, ``because then that would make me get excited.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiled shyly Sunday, raised his head slightly and looked at
the reporters surrounding him, hiding again. &QL;

MEXICO'S RULING PARTY ACCUSED OF DIVERTING MONEY

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTERREY, Mexico _ If opposition politicians had long surmised
that Mexico's ruling party was using its dominant position to
channel taxpayer money illegally to its party operations, no
evidence was ever assembled to prove those suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   But that changed after Fernando Canales Clariond took over as
governor of this northern state of Nuevo Leon in October 1997, the
first opposition candidate to be elected here in seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   He ordered an investigation, which has taken two years, and now
prosecutors say they have collected overwhelming evidence that
leaders of Mexico's governing Institutional Revolutionary Party
engaged in schemes to divert millions of dollars through dummy bank
accounts, including three set up under the names of two maids and a
gardener of a top party official.
</P>
<P>
   The former leader of the governing party here acknowledged in
recent court testimony that he personally accepted $136,000 a month
in public money, using it to finance the payrolls of the party,
known as the PRI, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've suspected during my entire generation that the PRI
financed its operations from public funds, but we couldn't prove it
until now,'' Canales, of the center-right National Action Party,
said in an interview. ``This has been like a psychiatric case where
you probe the unknown and come face to face with dramatic realities
that demand drastic change.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation has thrown the Nuevo Leon PRI into turmoil,
and it has taken on special significance because the scandal is
unfolding four months before Mexico's most competitive presidential
elections since the revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say they have documented some $8 million in secret
transfers from the Nuevo Leon treasury to the bogus accounts. From
those accounts, they say, funds were disbursed in cash to meet
party expenses throughout 1997, the last year the Institutional
Revolutionary Party controlled the state.
</P>
<P>
   They have imprisoned the former Nuevo Leon state treasurer,
Xavier Doria Gonzalez, on embezzlement charges and have informed
seven other Institutional Revolutionary Party officials, including
a national leader, that they are targets of the felony
investigation, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is forcing party leaders to choose between
defending members in public disgrace or blaming them for illegal
practices that prosecutors say appear to have been established
party procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I defend any member of our party as long as there's no proof
of wrongdoing, but as simple mortals we can commit errors,''
Ricardo Canavati, the PRI's current president in Nuevo Leon, said
in an interview in a Monterrey hotel. ``But we won't defend the
indefensible. If there was illegal conduct, then the law should be
enforced, for the good of our party.''
</P>
<P>
   Javier Trevino, a senior official based at the party's Mexico
City headquarters, said: ``The national committee of the PRI has
not and will not tolerate wrongdoing by individual party members.
We fully respect the rule of law and will act accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Two opposition parties have filed charges against the PRI with
Nuevo Leon electoral authorities, urging them to bar it from taking
part in state elections in July. Opposition leaders said they would
also lodge charges with the agency that organizes federal
elections.
</P>
<P>
   On the national level, opposition leaders have expressed
concerns that aides to President Ernesto Zedillo _ despite the
president's protestations to the contrary _ could carry out a
similar scheme and use government funds to help the PRI retain the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox Quesada, the leading opposition candidate for
president, has referred to the illegal payments in lambasting the
Institutional Revolutionary Party during virtually every recent
campaign rally.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Plutarco Elias Calles founded the PRI in 1929, using it to
unite Mexico's fractious regional warlords after two decades of
revolutionary violence. The government at first financed the party
openly, but within months after its birth the Supreme Court ruled
the funding unconstitutional, said Lorenzo Meyer, a historian at
the Colegio de Mexico in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been widely believed that the 13 consecutive PRI
presidents who have controlled Mexico and the party since have used
subterranean channels to finance the party, Meyer said. These
channels have included, at various times, assigning public
officials _ at taxpayer expense _ to coordinate party election
campaigns, lending government cars and trucks to move supporters to
rallies and polling places, and other methods, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For decades the government's generosity to the PRI put Mexico's
tiny opposition parties at a tremendous disadvantage, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Canales was overwhelmed in his first bid for governor in 1985 by
a juggernaut of PRI spending during the campaign and by vote theft
on election day, he recalled in an interview at the governor's
palace in Monterrey, the state capital.
</P>
<P>
   Recent legislation has greatly leveled Mexico's political
playing field, providing for state financing to all legally
registered parties. At the same time, penalties have been
strengthened for parties that cheat by taking government resources
that are not part of their legal quota.
</P>
<P>
   In the investigation in Nuevo Leon, prosecutors discovered in
scrutinizing bank records that Doria, the former state treasurer,
had set up accounts in the names of two of his maids and a
gardener, the state attorney general, Jose Gonzalez Suarez, said in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Doria had secretly transferred federal and state funds into the
accounts, later disbursing some to officials of the Nuevo Leon PRI,
the attorney general said.
</P>
<P>
   During Doria's 16-month tenure, which ended in 1997, some $22
million passed through the accounts set up in the names of his
servants, of which at least $8 million was disbursed to the party,
the attorney general said. He said Doria apparently pocketed the
other $14 million.
</P>
<P>
   Doria was arrested last July and is on trial for embezzlement.
He has refused to testify, citing his constitutional right not to
incriminate himself, said his lawyer, Javier Flores Saldivar.
</P>
<P>
   But Horacio del Bosque, the former president of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party in Nuevo Leon, took a different
posture when it was his turn to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors discovered documents signed by del Bosque, showing
that he received $136,000 every month during his 1997 tenure, drawn
from Doria's clandestine accounts, which he used to pay the
salaries of the PRI's Nuevo Leon staff, the attorney general said.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with that evidence and then a subpoena, del Bosque
acknowledged in the investigative proceedings that the PRI had
received the monthly disbursements of state funds, the attorney
general said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Mexican court rules, the testimony itself was not public,
but del Bosque published a long statement on March 1 in Monterrey
newspapers, titled ``I Show My Face Before Justice and My
Community,'' which the attorney general said repeated much of his
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI received economic support from the state treasury
throughout my presidency to support party operations, following an
established procedure,'' del Bosque said in the statement. He
called the procedures ``historical practice, rooted in the
traditions of our country for many years.''

NORTH CAROLINA ELIMINATES TULSA AND DOUBTS FOR SHOT AT DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ There will be blue blood, after all, in the
Final Four, a regal shade of North Carolina blue. The Tar Heels
entered tournament play as a No. 8-seeded team in the middle of a
two-game losing streak with a dull 18-13 record. But now, after
tripping Tulsa, 59-55, for the South Regional crown, all is
forgiven. All is forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   This edition of Carolina basketball has won despite adversity.
It has won over the Carolina throng of fans who once saw a dreary
team suddenly, amazingly, remarkably turn into a pristine gem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could say what I wanted to all the fans who left us and
all the media who slammed us, it would not be pretty,'' said
Carolina guard Ed Cota, a warrior who played the entire 40 minutes
before 16,731 fans in the Erwin Center and directed his team's
offense and defense, too. ``But then, to be fair, I must say even I
was kind of shocked at the way we played in our first tournament
game against Missouri. I mean, the intensity we had and the
teamwork was what had been missing all year. We built off that.''
</P>
<P>
   And the meshing continued, against Stanford and then Tennessee.
And now Tulsa. A Carolina four-game winning streak, the team's
first of the year. A season flipped inside out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry it took us so long to get going,'' Carolina Coach
Bill Guthridge said. ``But it couldn't come at a better time.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrence Newby, a Carolina senior guard, said: ``We started
getting the right people the ball at the right time against
Missouri. And then our confidence kept building from that. The
whole year Coach Guthridge said that we were learning and building
something and we'd be happy in April. We are. Teamwork. This is
what it takes to cut down the nets.''
</P>
<P>
   And Joseph Forte, the freshman Carolina guard who scored a
career-high and game-high 28 points added: ``What a relief. I
didn't want to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina (22-13) earned its 15th Final Four appearance,
its sixth in the past 10 years and its third in the past four
seasons. Guthridge, 80-27 at Carolina, is making his second Final
Four trip in three seasons as head coach. It was redemption for
Guthridge, under fire for most of the season. Cota is making his
third in four years.
</P>
<P>
   No Carolina team had ever reached the Final Four seeded lower
than No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lately, from the outside looking in, it looks like they're
playing with greater passion,'' Tulsa Coach Bill Self said about
the Tar Heels. ``They're two good shooting nights away from winning
it all. Whoever they play, I don't ever see Carolina as being an
underdog. The point spread my say so, but these guys have been
there before and they'll rise to the occasion. They're good enough
and this tournament is crazy enough that all you have to do is put
together three great weeks and they've put together two.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels coalesced to keep Tulsa (32-5) in misery. Tulsa
entered as the quicker team and Carolina the bigger one.
</P>
<P>
   In this game, size squashed quickness.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first problems for Tulsa developed early when the
senior forward Eric Coley _ the soul of the Golden Hurricanes _
labored with early foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out with a lot of energy, maybe too much energy,
because the early fouls were kind of silly,'' Coley said. ``I tried
to stay positive. Every time I went back into the game, it seemed
like I would get into more foul trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Coley played only 24 minutes in the game. He scored only 6
points, 6 fewer than his average. But it was on defense _ Coley is
the Western Athletic Conference's career steals leader _ where he
was missed most. Without him, Tulsa was unable to trap, pressure
and create turnovers, to speed up the game and force it into more
of a high-strung, fleet-footed affair.
</P>
<P>
   Cota and Carolina also ensured the game plodded along at a nice,
even pace, Carolina style, by milking the shot clock on offense.
For a half, Tulsa was up for the methodical game and led 31-30 at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   But then fewer than 2 minutes into the second half, Tulsa went
from being 1 point ahead to 5 points down as Carolina began
establishing its size in rebounding and in forcing Tulsa to alter
its shots over the Tar Heels' towering post players, especially the
7-foot center Brendan Haywood (3 blocks) and 6-foot-11-inch forward
Kris Lang. Both helped Carolina to a 40-29 rebounding advantage and
helped limit Tulsa to only 1 second-chance point compared with
Carolina's 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so big on the back line, the biggest we've seen,''
the 6-5 Coley said. ``We'd be able to get past the first line of
defense but then it was hard to go around and shoot over 6-11 and
7-foot guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Coley played 14 minutes in the second half. Without its
defensive leader, Tulsa was again unable to speed up the game by
trapping and forcing turnovers. Because Tulsa was missing so many
shots (22 of 32 in the second half), it was unable to set up the
press it prefers, a full-court one that attacks after Tulsa makes a
baskets.
</P>
<P>
   But Tulsa, like Carolina, was playing a pesky brand of
half-court defense, too. It limited North Carolina to 34.6 percent
shooting from the floor in the second half and to only 29 points.
That gave the Golden Hurricanes a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite trailing by 51-41 with 5 minutes 25 seconds remaining,
Tulsa eventually closed the gap to 57-55 led by 7 straight Golden
Hurricane points by the freshman guard Dante Swanson (his 15 points
led all Tulsa scorers). Coley fouled out with 18 seconds left, Cota
made one free throw and then Tulsa, trailing by 58-55, raced
upcourt. The freshman forward David Shelton (1 of 9 from the floor,
0 for 2 from 3-point range) fired a hurried 3-point shot that hit
the front rim. The ball bounced into the hands of Carolina forward
Jason Capel.
</P>
<P>
   Seven seconds and a Forte free throw later, the game was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We panicked,'' Self said of his team's last shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got some turnovers there and we thought, finally, the game
was going our way, our style,'' Tulsa center Brandon Kurtz (11
points, 9 rebounds) said.
</P>
<P>
   But Carolina imposed its will and won.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is in a class by itself,'' Cota said when asked to
compare his two other Carolina Final Four teams. ``It took us a
while to learn each other and find out what it takes to win. This
team learned it late _ but we know now.'' &QL;

PUTIN APPEARS TO BE HEADING TO OUTRIGHT VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Acting President Vladimir V. Putin appeared headed for
an outright victory in Russia's presidential election, but not
before a surprisingly strong showing by a Communist challenger gave
the Kremlin a scare and brought charges of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   With 69 percent of the vote from Sunday's election counted early
Monday, Putin had 51.17 percent of the vote, slightly more than the
simple majority needed to avoid a runoff election next month
against Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who was second with
30.37 percent. Liberal economist Grigory Yavlinsky was projected to
take third place with about 7 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The final tally was not expected until later Monday, but exit
polls suggested Putin, 47, would avoid a run-off with 51.2 percent.
But what would be seen as a landslide anywhere else came as the
first sign of fallibility for Putin, who had hoped for a sweeping
victory and a clear mandate for his promise to impose order at home
and to revive Russia's image abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The somber former Soviet spy, who had never before run for
public office, has been Russia's dominant politician since taking
over in the Kremlin after Boris N. Yeltsin resigned on New Year's
eve, and was always expected to win this election. Few doubt Putin
would have prevailed over Zyuganov in a run-off. But his popularity
rating, once at 70 percent over public approval for his hard line
against Chechen rebels, has gradually slipped.
</P>
<P>
   Early results from Russia's Pacific coast and eastern Siberia
had put Putin at 45 percent, causing Zyuganov, and many other
observers, to predict a runoff vote. As Putin's rating slowly rose
throughout the evening, some commentators suggested that the
Kremlin might be doctoring the results.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov went further, openly accusing the government of using
the computerized tallying system to inflate Putin's support and
steal his own. Zyuganov claimed his real support was closer to 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often they use the electric system to bring people figures
that do not correspond with the real ones,'' Zyuganov told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's election committee chairman, Alexander Veshnyakov, said
he had no evidence of major falsifications. He also suggested that
Zyuganov had more supporters in the east, and that Putin's share of
the votes grew as the ballot counting moved west along Russia's 11
time zones to the major urban centers where Putin is strongest.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's own campaign staff suggested their candidate may have
been hurt by the widespread assumption that he would win, which
convinced many Russians that there was no need to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Independent analysts said the vote had shown that millions of
Russians had used the election to register their discontent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The far east is a very handicapped region economically, and
there is a strong protest vote there, and Putin represents the
Kremlin,'' said veteran political commentator Alexei Pushkov said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, looking relaxed after a day spent at a Russian bath house
in a village outside Moscow, acknowledged the strong show of
support for Zyuganov despite his lack of funding and the daily
media coverage. He promised to pay attention to the popular
discontent indicated by the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means that our policy must be more balanced, take into
account the existing realities and aim at increasing living
standards,'' Putin said at a news conference at his campaign
headquaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means that there is a large amount of the Russian
population that is not satisfied with the way things are,'' Putin,
clad in a casual gray sweater, said at the briefing early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's promise of restoring law and order have struck a chord
with many voters, and his straight-talking, can-do image, honed
during the Chechen campaign, have made him an instant favorite of a
country tired of the doddering Yeltsin. One analyst, Igor Bunin,
called Putin ``the anti-Yeltsin.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said a first-round victory would give Putin an added
measure of independence from the Kremlin insiders and regional
elites who have heavily influenced Russian politics in the past
years. How he will use this mandate, or whether he truly seeks
independence, is still anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has barely campaigned, and has revealed little about his
plans beyond vague promises to fight corruption, revive the economy
and restore the pride of Russia's armed forces. He insists he is a
democrat, but stresses to strengthen the role of the state and its
security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian liberals fear Putin may reverse Russia's fragile
democratic achievements and restore a measure of the broad police
controls of the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we buried the idea of a liberal democracy in Russia,''
Yevgenia Albats, a prominent Russian journalist, said on privately
run NTV television.
</P>
<P>
   She was addressing former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, who
typifies Russian political and business leaders who believe Putin
will restore confidence in the economy, making stalled reforms
finally bring results.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, Putin warned his countrymen not to expect miracles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people start believing in a miracle that does not happen,
then despair will begin,'' Putin told reporters in his campaign
headquarters. ``People are tired, they have it hard, and they
expect a change for the better, but miracles do not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 68 percent of Russia's 108 million registered voters
took part in the balloting Sunday. The turnout was average for
post-Communist Russia, but less than the high turnout Putin had
hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   Putin did welcome the 65 percent turnout in war-ravaged
Chechnya, saying the vote there was a sign that Russia's military
campaign against rebels was working.
</P>
<P>
   But a new attack by the separatists in a mountain village showed
that the rebels are not the defeated force Moscow says they are.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a car bomb exploded in the city of Makhachkala, the
capital of the Russian republic of Dagestan near Chechnya early
Monday, injuring a local government official and his driver.
Chechen rebel attacks on Dagestan last summer and unsolved, deadly
apartment bombings in Dagestan and other Russian cities including
Moscow, were among the reasons Putin has often given for sending
troops into Chechnya.

FRANKEL MAKES IT FIVE IN SANTA ANA HANDICAP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ If there is a race that establishes the
country's best older female horse, it's the Santa Ana Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   One need look no further than the race's impressive list of past
winners. It's a list that includes such names as Fiji, Anoconnor,
Reloy, The Very One and Belle Marie.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Spanish Fern added her name to that roll call of winners
in the $150,000 Grade II 1-1/8 mile route on the Santa Anita turf
course. Perhaps it was her destiny. After all, trainer Robert
Frankel has now won the race five times in its 33-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some nice fillies,'' said Frankel's assistant
trainer Humberto Ascanio. ``And, that's the key to winning this
race.''
</P>
<P>
   In winning, Spanish Fern and jockey Victor Espinoza covered the
nine furlongs in a slow 1:49.30. She paid $5.60, $2.60 and $2.60.
</P>
<P>
   For Espinoza, who's been on a hot streak lately, the win was his
third of the day. He took a call in the jock's room from Frankel
who told him to lay off the pace and fire late. He did just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did the job the way Bobby (Frankel) wanted,'' Ascanio said.
``(Frankel) told him to make a late run -- he did a good job on the
rail.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay, who rode in Saturday's Dubai World Cup arrived back in
Los Angeles late Sunday and was delayed en route to Santa Anita
from the airport, officials said. Virginie paid $3 and $2.40.
</P>
<P>
   Third was Country Garden with Eddie Delahoussaye in the saddle.
She paid $3.30.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel, a member of the Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame, now
has saddled five winners in the Santa Ana Handicap. They are, last
year's winner, See You Soon; 1995 champion Wandesta; and 1994
champion Possibly Perfect. In 1992 he won the race with Gravieres.
</P>
<P>
   --California Thoroughbred racing lost a huge part of its heart
with the passing of Clement Hirsch on Thursday at the age of 85.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch's friends Sunday remembered him as the man responsible
for bringing Oak Tree to Santa Anita and saving the Del Mar meet,
when it was nearly put out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Del Mar's lease came up, he was the most influential one
in making sure it stayed there,'' said trainer Warren Stute. ``He
did a lot for racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of my very good friends,' Stute said. ``He was not
only intelligent, but he was also one of the most honest men I've
ever met.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a Marine during World War II and participated in the
landing at Guadalcanal,'' Chillingsworth. said. ``Not many people
know that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard that he went to a party once and took the MGM lion
with him,'' Chillingsworth said. ``He was showman. But, he was also
kind and courteous. When he lost he never bitched about it. He was
always a gentleman.

CLINTON UNABLE TO BRIDGE ISRAEL-SYRIA DIFFERENCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite having persuaded Syria's ailing president,
Hafez Assad, to make a rare trip abroad, President Clinton failed
Sunday in Geneva to restart the Israel-Syria peace talks _ the
least ambitious of his earlier goals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Assad talked for three hours in their first
face-to-face discussions in six years, and while White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart characterized the session as ``very
useful,'' he added, ``The differences are significant and
important, and obviously more work needs to be done to bridge them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe it would be productive'' for Syrian-Israeli
talks to restart, he said. ``It is impossible to predict when those
talks might resume.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's quick stopover at the end of a grueling weeklong South
Asia trip revealed, according to analysts, the administration's
lack of groundwork in the negotiations as well as the intransigence
of both Israel and Syria on the key question of establishing a new
border.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 50 years of enmity between Israel and Syria,
Middle East experts believe that the conditions are now ripe for
the countries to reach a treaty, based on the principle of Israel
returning all or much of the Golan Heights to Syria and Syria
opening normal relations with Israel _ including the flying of an
Israeli flag above a new embassy in Damascus, only a
four-and-a-half hour car ride from Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   But after Sunday's Clinton-Assad meeting, it was clear again
that the sides can't agree on how to resume talking.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's depth of mistrust of the process was freshly telegraphed
just a day before the meeting. It came on the smallest of issues.
Syrian officials refused to agree to a joint press conference
because of the presence of Israeli journalists, a US official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can't let Israeli journalists into a press conference,
how do you expect Israel to give up lakefront'' on the Sea of
Galilee in exchange for peace, said a US official, speaking on the
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours before the Clinton-Assad meeting, Syria's refusal
to attend a press conference caused senior US officials to suddenly
play down the expectations from the meeting. ``There's no guarantee
here,'' Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said prior to the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly, US officials were disappointed at the outcome and
uncertain of what to do next. Lockhart said Clinton would meet with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Tuesday to chart the next step.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is,'' said the US official, ``I don't think there
are any new ideas. It's really up to both sides on whether they
want to make a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak, in an interview with the Globe Sunday at the Blair
House, said Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak should
not underestimate Assad's firmness in insisting that Israel return
all the land it captured from Syria after June 4, 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will not make any concessions. . . . If he makes any
concessions, there are going to be terrible problems for him. I
told Barak the same thing,'' Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
   Israel also is insisting on security guarantees in the deal,
which could mean putting an Israeli observer at a guardpost atop
Mount Hermon, the highest point on the Golan Heights, or receiving
intelligence on Syrian troop movements from US satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such difficulties, the Egyptian president said he
believed an Israel-Syria deal could be completed in two or three
months, an optimistic assessment based on talks with both leaders
in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke to Barak by telephone after the meeting, and US
Middle East envoy Dennis Ross left Geneva for Jerusalem, where he
will give Barak a fuller briefing on the Clinton-Assad talks.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh told the
Associated Press the main sticking point was Syria's demand for a
prior commitment to give back the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Syria insists upon dictating an agreement and
not obtaining an agreed-upon agreement is what made the resumption
of the talks impossible,'' Sneh said.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, Syrian presidential spokesman Joubran Kourieh said in
a statement that Israel was the one placing obstacles. He repeated
Syria's demand that negotiations must resume on the basis of an
Israeli commitment to withdraw from the entire Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Syrian statement, Lockhart said, ``I would not
agree with any statement that tries to place responsibility on one
side or the other from moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts had called the Clinton-Assad meeting the best
chance for a peace deal between Israel and Syria for several
reasons: Israel's upcoming deadline for pulling troops out of south
Lebanon, which could greatly strain regional tensions if it were
done unilaterally; Clinton has only the rest of the year before he
leaves office; and Assad's poor health.
</P>
<P>
   The solitary fact of Assad traveling to Geneva despite his
well-documented aversion to trips abroad caused speculation that
Clinton's discussions with him and Barak since talks had broken
down in January at Shepherdstown, W.Va., had led to a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   But those predictions withered Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It demonstrated once again, that it's not necessarily the case
. . . that if they meet, there's an indication they're close,''
said Geoffrey Aronson, head of Foundation for Middle East Peace, a
Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Aronson and others, though, said that progress still could be
made between Israel and Syria, and soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may not be anything but a little bump on the road here,''
he said. ``That's my sense because so much of the answers to the
issues have been given.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, said the US official, no progress in Geneva was
``dramatic. The president will keep pushing this thing. He'll go
back to doing what he was doing after Shepherdstown _ talking to
both sides. Except now, there's not as much time left.''

<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Los Angeles Dodgers manager Davey Johnson has
seen enough. Carlos Perez is in the starting rotation and Eric
Gagne is on his way to Triple-A Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, horrific in his first two starts, clinched it Sunday
against Florida with five innings of solid pitching on three days'
rest. The lefty allowed an unearned run on four hits, walked three
and struck out four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to say pretty much (Perez is the starter),'' Johnson
said. ``He's come back from a little shaky start and he's thrown
the ball good for me. I thought his mechanics were good, I thought
he made some good pitches, used his fastball well.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Gagne faltered terribly, it was Perez who clinched the
deal. Johnson wanted to see improvement, and in his last three
starts Perez obliged. In that span Perez has shown improved
mechanics and an ability to throw his split-finger fastball for key
outs while posting a 2.57 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   While Gagne's ERA ballooned to 15.63, Perez's has dropped to
5.68. And though Johnson is keeping quiet about when Perez will
pitch, the rotation is set for Perez to pitch the finale of the
four-game series in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's already said Kevin Brown will start the opener,
followed by Chan Ho Park. He's also said Darren Dreifort would
pitch the Friday series-opener in New York. Orel Hershiser is
slated to start the third game in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can't be anymore surprises,'' Perez said. ``What more do
I have to do? Nothing else. I'm happy with my last three starts. If
they want to see a bunch of shutouts, just wait until the season
starts. If they really want to see nine innings, eight innings,
just wait. This is spring training. I don't want to be too excited,
but I feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the situation could leave the Dodgers in a jam if
Hershiser and Perez, who pitch back-to-back, struggle to eat
innings. Hershiser averaged 5 innings per start last season while
Perez averaged 5 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said lefty Onan Masaoka will pitch in a Tripe-A game
Tuesday to stretch out his arm. Johnson said Masaoka would be the
Dodgers' situational lefty and, most likely, long relief man out of
the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield returns: Left fielder Gary Sheffield missed eight
games after gashing his left pinkie sliding into third base, and
returned to club two homers against the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could have seen more breaking balls so I could gauge
that and see where I'm at with that,'' Sheffield said. ``But I saw
two and swung the bat real well on them, so if I see a few more
I'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Outside of having Perez on the mound, the
Dodgers' lineup was what it will most likely be opening day, which
is a week from today in Montreal. It was Devon White (CF), Mark
Grudzielanek (2B), Sheffield (LF), Shawn Green (RF), Eric Karros
(1B), Todd Hundley (C), Adrian Beltre (3B) and Kevin Elster
(SS).... Right-hander Antonio Osuna remains ahead of schedule in
his recovery from elbow surgery, but don't expect him back until
there's a spot for him in the bullpen. When the time comes, Johnson
said he would use Osuna as a long relief man when he was ready to
join the Dodgers.... Right-hander Mike Fetters had to assure his
health to the Dodgers by bringing back an old tradition. He had to
run the 17th street bridge, which goes over the Indian River. ``It
was tougher than I thought,'' Fetters said. ``The wind was right in
my face, but I'll do it again if they want. I'll do anything they
want.''

EGYPTIAN LEADER EXPRESSES OPTIMISM ON MIDEAST PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt arrived here at an
opportune time. President Clinton needs to talk.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton on &UR;  &LR; Sunday failed to restart peace talks between
Israel and Syria in Geneva, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said
that Clinton will meet Mubarak on Tuesday for a ``discussion on how
we move this forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak, in an interview with the Globe on Sunday at the time of
Clinton's meeting with Syrian President Hafez Assad, expressed
optimism an Israel-Syria deal was within reach.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted a settlement could happen in ``two or three months,
maximum,'' adding that leaders in both countries have told him in
the last week they are ready for a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak, 71, dressed in a blue pin-striped suit and appearing
relaxed in the living room of the Blair House, the guest quarters
of leaders visiting US presidents, has been a central go-between
for various peace tracks for years.
</P>
<P>
   But since the death of Jordan's King Hussein, US officials
regard him as the lone credible leader in the Arab world on peace,
able to reach out to the United States, Israel, and the Arab
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak has especially stepped up his contacts with Israel,
talking often to Prime Minister Ehud Barak. ``Mubarak may be the
one that now talks turkey with Israel,'' said one US official
Sunday, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Something along the
lines of, `If you want to live in this neighborhood, you need to
share.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Mubarak's role, he suggested it was only natural an
Egyptian leader would assume the role of mediator, given that
Middle East peace started with Egypt and Israel 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every single person _ man, woman, and child _ in the
Middle East, peace is so important to us, for this area has been
living for about 50 years with problems and war,'' Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak, on a week-long visit to Washington, also said the
Middle East needs to rid itself of weapons of mass destruction. He
said sanctions against Iraq have failed and Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein's regime was ``stronger than ever before.'' He also
mentioned Egypt's hopes to become a high-tech mecca.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to comment on the investigation of EgyptAir Flight
990 that plunged into the Atlantic Ocean last October, killing all
217 people aboard. Some US media reports have said the Egyptian
government pressured the National Transportation Safety Board
against turning the case over to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak responded: ``We are not putting pressures. . . . How
could we exert pressure on the American investigators? How?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the wide range of topics, he kept returning to the
prospects for peace, both the Israeli-Palestinian talks and the
Israel-Syria track.
</P>
<P>
   He revealed that a major stumbling block during Israel-Syria
talks in Shepherdstown, W.Va., in January was Israel's insistence _
and Syria's refusal _ that Lebanon join negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian president said he told Barak in a telephone
conversation Thursday, ``you shouldn't create any problem during
the negotiations (on Lebanon) because the Syrians may refuse
anything with Lebanon for the time being. Lebanon is going to join
the negotiations later on.''
</P>
<P>
   For Israel, a deal with Syria necessarily involves Lebanon, from
which Israel plans to withdraw troops by July. As part of a deal
and its troop withdrawal, Israel would want to negotiate an end to
border skirmishes between its troops and Hezbollah guerrillas in
southern Lebanon. Syria, which has 40,000 troops in Lebanon, is the
main powerbroker there.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking bluntly, Mubarak gave his vision of how peace would
unfold.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Israel-Syria deal would have to entail the complete
return of the Golan Heights captured by Israel in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Assad is keen on peace. He wants a fair solution,
going back to the borders occupied since 1967,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, he said, leaning forward in his chair, ``told me several
times that he is going on the same track'' as the late Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Rabin, Mubarak said, ``personally told me
that he was ready to give back the Golan to the Syrians, but he
wanted to know what he was getting back in detail.''
</P>
<P>
   That conversation, Mubarak said, led him to tell the Syrians
then to ``do just as we did with the Israelis'' _ gain back every
inch of land captured in the 1967 Six-Day War in return for peace.
</P>
<P>
   If Syria and Lebanon reach peace deals with Israel, what would
happen to the Syrian troops now in Lebanon? Many Lebanese say their
land is occupied by two armies, Israel by force and Syria by
invitation. ``After a comprehensive peace settlement is reached,''
Mubarak said, ``I think most of the Syrian troops will go back to
Syria.''
</P>
<P>
   But comprehensive peace won't come, the Egyptian president said,
until Israel reaches an agreement with the Palestinians over who
controls Jerusalem, resettlement of 3 million Palestinian refugees,
water rights and Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   True peace, he said, won't arrive until the region rids itself
of weapons of mass destruction. Israel is commonly believed to be
one of the nine countries in the world to possess nuclear weapons.
Israel, Egypt, and Syria are all generally regarded by
nonproliferation experts to have chemical weapons facilities and
missile-delivering capabilities. Iran and Iraq, meanwhile, are
believed to be in the midst of building nuclear, chemical and,
biological weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   With numerous weapons of mass destruction in the region, ``this
will make everybody suspicious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres ``once said that
whenever we reach a comprehensive settlement in the whole area, we
don't need this, we will discuss this,'' Mubarak said, regarding
Israel's nuclear program. ``I hope they could honor these words.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Mubarak did not indicate that the Middle East
conventional arms race would slow. Since the 1978 Camp David peace
accords, Egypt has received more than $32 billion in military
assistance from the United States. It is the second largest
recipient of US foreign aid, behind Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what will happen in three, four, five years, we
have Iran, Iraq, so many other countries,'' said Mubarak, who will
meet with Pentagon officials during his visit. ``Each country
should have forces up-to-date, but away from weapons of mass
destruction.''

POPE PRAYS AT WESTERN WALL   TO CAP PILGRIMAGE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Pope John Paul II's hand trembled Sunday as he
reached out across 2,000 years of history to touch the ancient
Herodian stone of the Western Wall, the most holy site in Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   The frail, 79-year-old pontiff sank to his knees in the Church
of the Holy Sepulchre and then prayed at the site where the
Christian faith holds the resurrection of Jesus occurred.
</P>
<P>
   He ascended the hill Muslims call the ``Noble Sanctuary'' to see
the shimmering, golden Dome of the Rock, where the faithful believe
the prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day of images that will endure through history as the
pope crowned his Holy Land pilgrimage with a final interfaith
journey that wove its way through the narrow, cobble-stone paths of
Jerusalem's walled Old City to visit the three clustered sites so
revered by Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most indelible of these images and certainly the one
most laden with history came at the Western Wall.
</P>
<P>
   When the pope shuffled forward slowly and stood before the
massive stones _ all that remains of the Second Temple, which was
destroyed by Rome in AD 70 _ he placed a note in a crack in the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving prayerful notes in the crevices and nooks of the
yellow-gray, hand-hewn stones is a tradition for generations of
Jewish worshipers, and the pope's was a prayer for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``God of our fathers, you chose Abraham and his descendants to
bring your Name to the Nations,'' read the typewritten message,
which was saved by Israeli authorities and will be kept for
display. ``We are deeply saddened by the behavior of those who in
the course of history have caused these children of yours to suffer
and, asking your forgiveness, we wish to commit ourselves to
genuine brotherhood with the people of the Covenant.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope's words were from an address earlier this month in Rome
in which he offered a sweeping apology for Christian sins of the
past. He had reiterated this theme at a moving ceremony Thursday at
Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial. But this was a gesture at
the holiest site in all of Judaism. And standing there murmuring a
prayer in his white vestments, slumped over with age, against the
backdrop of the massive wall, he appeared to have deeply touched
the hearts of many Israelis and Jews worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Brodman, 40, an Orthodox rabbi from Jerusalem who came to
see the momentous occasion, said, ``This is history we saw today.
It seems that this pope is a real friend of the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``That picture of him at our `kotel,' '' he said, using the
Hebrew word for the wall, ``is the sign of Christianity and
Jerusalem coming together again after 2,000 years.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul became the first pope to pray at the site of the
Temple since Peter, among the first disciples whom Jesus chose to
lead the church and who is the pope's spiritual predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   The wall embodied sadness for Diaspora Jews forced out of
Jerusalem by the Roman Empire and only allowed to return once a
year to lament for all they had lost, which is why it is also known
as the ``Wailing Wall.'' The Jews' exile was viewed by the early
Christian church as a punishment for failing to accept Jesus
Christ. But in 1967 when Israel captured the Old City from Jordan,
the wall, the western retaining wall of the Temple Mount, took on
new symbolism of the triumphant reemergence of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   ``By standing there, this symbolized the humility of the church
which for Jews had been viewed as arrogant,'' said Father Jerome
Murhpy-O'Connor, a priest of the Dominican order and one of the
world's preeminent biblical historians. ``By standing there he
transformed the relationship of Christianity toward Judaism. It is
a complete reversal of history.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope's comments were also a balm over wounding words made
the day before when the Palestinian Muslim chief cleric _ whom the
pope visited Sunday at the Dome of the Rock _ was dismissive of the
horrors of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way of the pope's pilgrimage Sunday _ and throughout
his week-long sojourn through what he called the ``history of
salvation'' _ the pope carefully navigated the minefield of
religious and political themes of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   By the time his Israeli El Al plane had departed from Tel Aviv
for Rome Sunday evening, the pope seemed to have succeeded in
making a great plea for reconciliation and a resonant call for
peace in a land that writhes with bitterness and violence. Whether
any of his message will affect Israelis and Palestinians as they
head into the critical, final phase of the peace process remains to
be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Israelis of almost all political and religious
persuasions seemed to embrace his message of reflection on
Christian anti-Semitism that contributed to the Holocaust. And
Palestinians seemed uplifted by his message of peace and justice
and a recognition of their suffering as refugees under Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   In the Old City, the pope wound his way through the streets in a
white Chevrolet Suburban. As he passed through the Christian
Quarter, hundreds of people struggled to catch a glimpse of the
pope's motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   Asharaf Abu Gesh, 21, blessed himself as the pope passed,
saying, ``This is a man of peace. As Palestinian Christians, we are
very proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Lena Qassem, 23, a Muslim, who is a medical student, said, ``The
pope is very popular among Arabs for his stance on the side of
justice. He is always with victims, and he knows we are the victims
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing security concerns, the Israelis had virtually shut down
the entire Old City, forcing shops to close and people to stay in
their homes. The move had outraged Palestinian Christians and
Muslims who wanted to welcome the pope. The Israelis also refused
to allow Christian Palestinian political leaders to attend the
pope's mass at the Holy Sepulchre.
</P>
<P>
   Hanan Ashrawi, a Palestinian legislator and member of the
Anglican church, who said she was infuriated that Israelis had
pressured church officials not to permit her to attend the mass
because she was a political leader, said, ``They wanted to make an
impression that Jerusalem is an empty city. . . . That our churches
are only empty museums. . . . But Jerusalem is a living, throbbing
city in pain, under siege and under occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   As the pontiff was reminded at almost every turn in the warrens
of this city of stone, the most explosive issue of all was the
future status of Jerusalem and its competing claims of sovereignty.
Israel claims it as its eternal, indivisible capital. Palestinians
say East Jerusalem must be the capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have tried to capitalize on the pope's visit. The
Western Wall plaza was festooned with 50 Israeli flags fluttering
in the wind and strategically placed around the podium from which
the pope spoke.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, ordered by Israel not to raise flags, were
forced to be creative. They unleashed an enormous column of baloons
of red, white, black, and green _ the colors of Palestine _ and
some with actual flags tethered to them floating all over the city
just before the pope's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   The pope had vowed to come to Jerusalem on a spiritual
pilgrimage and not a political trip, and in the end, he lived up to
that. On Sunday, he made a surprise and secretive return visit to
the Holy Sepulchre. There, far from the glare of the TV cameras and
the crowds vying to greet him, he slipped into the Crusader-era
church and climbed the steep steps that lead up to ``Golgotha,''
the rocky outcropping where it is believed Jesus was crucified.
There, amid the cool shadows and smell of frankincense he quietly
prayed.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Cardinal Adam Maida said, ``This is the highlight.
This is the most spiritual. . . . Spiritually for Christians, the
Holy Sepulchre is where it all began because of the resurrection. .
. . The pope is a mystic and very spiritual man. He is unsteady on
his feet. He appears weak, but this has probably been the strongest
moment of his pontificate.''

BUSH THE BABY BOOMER WILL BE HIS PARTY'S FIRST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By the time Gov. George W. Bush became the de facto
Republican presidential nominee, there were several striking
numbers that defined his candidacy and helped explain his success.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy million: the estimate of dollars he had raised for the
primary fight. One hundred ninety: the count of members of the
House of Representatives who had endorsed him.
</P>
<P>
   But a smaller number that drew less notice could be the most
significant of all: 54. That is how old the Texas governor, whose
birthday is July 6, will be at the Republican National Convention
in August, and it will make Bush the party's youngest nominee in 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   It will also make him the first Republican nominee in more than
30 years who is almost the same age as his Democratic rival _ Vice
President Al Gore will be 53 at the Democratic National Convention
_ and the first who was born too late to have had any involvement
in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   That youthfulness and generational shift are more than
interesting trivia. They represent a changing of the guard for the
Republican Party. And they are keys to why so many party leaders
believed that Bush could credibly cast himself as a new-style
Republican who, to borrow a metaphor that was clubbed to death in
the last presidential election, is a bridge to the country's
future, not its past.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a definite underlying, subliminal theme within the
party that we needed to nominate a hip young conservative, somebody
who can directly relate to baby boomers, who understands them,''
said Greg Mueller, a Republican strategist in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I say hip, I don't mean music,'' Mueller added. ``I mean
politically hip to the issues of the day, someone who is looking
forward and looking to the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   Mueller and other political analysts said that Bush's repeatedly
stated desire to inject a new sensitivity and compassion into the
Republican Party _ a message crafted with the political
sensibilities of swing voters in mind _ requires an accompanying
image that defies voters' expectations for a Republican
presidential candidate in vivid, easily projected ways.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aura of youthfulness is one of those ways. It stands in
stark contrast to the personas of the party's last two nominees:
Bush's father, who was 68 in 1992, and Bob Dole, who was 73 in
1996. Both men lost to Bill Clinton, who was 45 at the Democratic
convention in 1992, and 50 at the convention in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's doings and demeanor on the campaign trail often
accentuate his energy and athleticism, sometimes deliberately,
sometimes not.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the Iowa caucuses in January, the governor ended a
campaign appearance in Council Bluffs by straying over to a band of
college students who had been loudly playing popular music,
lingering over the drummer and moving rhythmically to the beat.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, in New Hampshire, Bush's itinerary was chock-full
of physical fun and play: bowling, soccer, a ride on a snowmobile,
a trip down a snowy hillside on a sled. One of his advisers in the
state said that the Bush campaign had been consciously trying to
convey the governor's vigor and vitality.
</P>
<P>
   But that bid is a complicated endeavor. For one thing, Gore is
working the same theme with his blue jeans, his Palm Pilot and a
campaign appearance in California last year in which former members
of the Grateful Dead allowed his wife, Tipper, to take a seat at a
drum set and jam with them.
</P>
<P>
   For another, one of Bush's sustained challenges has been to
project a proper degree of presidential seriousness, which his
playfulness carries the risk of undercutting.
</P>
<P>
   Playful was not a word often associated with the party's last
nominee, Bob Dole, who was 23 years older than Clinton. While that
gap was especially large, it belonged to a decades-long pattern in
presidential politics. The last time the Republican nominee was
younger than the Democratic one was in 1968, when Richard M. Nixon,
55, beat Hubert H. Humphrey, 57.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, the Republican candidates (Nixon in 1972, Gerald
Ford in 1976, Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984, Bush's father in 1988
and 1992, and Dole in 1996) have been at least nine years older
than their Democratic counterparts. In six of those seven
elections, the Republican nominee was over 60. In all of them, the
Democratic nominee was under 60.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts and historians said this tradition fed into
an identity for the Republican Party that Bush would clearly like
to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Republican Party always fights the image of being
reactionary, of being backward-looking, of not being atop the most
recent trends in the country,'' said Allan J. Lichtman, chairman of
the history department at American University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of a transition for the Republican Party,'' Lichtman
said of Bush's age, ``this is important.''
</P>
<P>
   Youth alone is by no means a clear advantage. In the span of
time that Republican nominees have been older than Democratic ones,
the Republican Party has emerged victorious more often than not.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican nominee in the last several decades has proved as
popular as Reagan, with younger voters as well as older ones. And
Reagan was 69 when he was first inaugurated, 73 when he began his
second term.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Bush's age _ and for that matter, Gore's _ has a
potential downside. Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster in Atlanta,
said that Clinton, the first baby boomer in the White House, turned
that generational status into a double-edged sword because his
behavior played into stereotypes of his generation as
self-absorbed, indulgent and reckless.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, political analysts said, Bush's appeal to
voters as someone who is in touch with their concerns and
lifestyles is strengthened by youthful attributes, including the
fact that he still has school-age children, twin 18-year-old
daughters, living at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a connectedness factor,'' said Bill McInturff, the
Republican pollster who worked for the presidential campaign of
Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   And it clearly gives Bush an ability to try to relate to voters
of different ages without looking ridiculous or uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   As he left a bookstore in Chicago in December, Bush noticed that
a 20-year-old sales clerk had rings in her pierced tongue.
Seemingly charmed and intrigued by that detail, he stopped to chat
with her about it. There were no television cameras and only one
reporter nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you eat steaks?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't eat meat,'' she responded, and as the easy exchange
continued, Bush wore a delighted expression that was positively
boyish. It was not a look that his Republican predecessors often
managed.

NUCLEAR PLANT IN BRITAIN ADMITS IT WAS VICTIM OF SABOTAGE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ With an international outcry building for the closing
of one of Britain's most troubled nuclear fuel processing plants,
its operators acknowledged Sunday that a saboteur had severed
cables controlling robotic operations in a radioactive area of the
installation.
</P>
<P>
   The admission added to a growing catalog of safety-related
problems at the sprawling Sellafield plant on the Irish Sea in
remote northwestern England. The problems began to emerge late last
year when inspection documents accompanying a shipment of nuclear
fuel pellets bound for Japanese reactors were found to have been
falsified.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the United States has said it would send safety
investigators to the plant, operated by British Nuclear Fuels, a
government-owned company that has been granted multibillion-dollar
contracts by the U.S. government to help with nuclear waste
disposal. The U.S. energy secretary, Bill Richardson, said recently
that ``business as usual is over'' with British Nuclear Fuels.
</P>
<P>
   German, Swedish and Swiss authorities have also suspended
contracts with Sellafield following the Japanese debacle. Last
month, German authorities said they, too, had been sent nuclear
fuel with falsified documentation.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland suspended contracts over the weekend, halting
shipments of spent fuel rods to be reprocessed at Sellafield.
Sweden also said it would stop sending spent fuel for reprocessing.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about nuclear contamination of the Irish Sea, the
Irish and Danish governments have said they would discuss joint
action Monday to press for closing the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions there have taken the highly unusual step of urging
the 10,000 workers to identify the suspected saboteur in their
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was clearly an inside job,'' said Jack Dromey, a
spokesman for the labor unions represented at the plant, which lies
near Britain's Lake district. Referring to the impact of the
sabotage some time last month on pressures for the plant's closing,
he said, ``This is the last chance for Sellafield.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though unions were asking workers to inform on colleagues,
he said, ``no one is more at risk from a Sellafield saboteur than
the work force.'' The police and government inspectors are
investigating the incident.
</P>
<P>
   British Nuclear Fuels said the sabotage affected a robotic arm
handling nuclear waste used in maintenance procedures that
controlled six separate operations. There has been no explanation
of why it was done, and the company said it did not affect safety.
</P>
<P>
   The Sellafield plant, dating to the 1950s, has always drawn
strong criticism from environmentalists and advocacy groups
concerned about issues ranging from radioactive contamination of
the Irish Sea to health risks for people living nearby.
</P>
<P>
   But the newest series of complaints have raised new concerns
about the plant's future in a region where, in addition to its own
staff and contract work force, another 10,000 people, such as
storekeepers, depend on its existence for their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, a supervisory
authority, said recently that, in addition to issuing false
documentation, the Sellafield plant had also included shipments of
dubious quality to Japan. Japanese authorities are pressing for
Britain to take the shipments back.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of the company, John Taylor, was forced to
resign, but only a handful of workers linked to the falsification
of documents have been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the work force following the sabotage incident,
the labor unions represented at the plant called the situation
there ``drastic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should underestimate the potential impact that this
incident has upon all our futures at Sellafield,'' the letter said.

YOUNG FLORIDA PLAYS WITH INSPIRATION INTO THE FINAL FOUR 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ Few college basketball fans figured Florida for
the Final Four, but there go the Gators _ catch them if you can.
Young, fast, tough and talented, they advanced to the penultimate
round Sunday with a thorough 77-65 victory over Oklahoma State in
the final of the East Regional of the National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament in the Carrier Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a tough basketball team to play,'' said Mike Miller, a
sophomore forward who led the Gators with 14 points and was named
most valuable player in the region. ``We're a great basketball team
when we execute and play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   In a motivational ploy devised by Coach Billy Donovan and a team
counselor, Miller and his teammates wore on their ankles the names
of relatives or friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what you accomplish in your life, if you have no
one to share it with, it doesn't mean a thing,'' Donovan said. ``We
needed something motivationally to have them reach down inside. We
tried to have them dedicate this game to someone they love.''
</P>
<P>
   It is only the second time that Florida has advanced this far.
In 1994, the Gators lost to Duke in the semifinals. Florida will
play North Carolina on Saturday in Indianapolis. The Tar Heels
eliminated Tulsa earlier this afternoon. In the other semifinal,
Michigan State will play Wisconsin. Florida, seeded fifth in this
region, is 28-7 and beat top-seeded Duke on Friday night. Oklahoma
State, seeded third, finished 27-7.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys started four seniors and a sophomore, but it was
Florida _ with no senior starters _ that played with poise
bordering on cockiness. Cowboys Coach Eddie Sutton said that for
much of the first half ``we looked like our team was in a daze. We
missed too many easy shots. We made some foolish turnovers,
carelessness on our part.''
</P>
<P>
   Udonis Haslem and Donnell Harvey each added 10 points for
Florida. Fredrik Jonzen led Oklahoma State with 14 points. Glendon
Alexander had 13 and Joe Adkins 12. But Adkins made only 4 of 14
field-goal attempts and the team shot 42 percent from the field.
Gottlieb, the point guard, said the Gators ``run waves at you''
with their many substitutions and ``maybe your shots are out of
rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Gators opened the game with the full-court press that
has served them so well, the Cowboys had little trouble solving it,
passing and running up the court for easy baskets and a 5-point
lead. The only turnover forced by the press in the first nine
minutes came when an official called a five-second violation on
Gottlieb, the Cowboys' veteran guard who was moving back and forth
while trying to inbound the ball from the baseline. Sutton thought
his team was the victim of a fast count and got whistled for a
technical foul when he protested.
</P>
<P>
   It proved ominous as the Gators surged to a 33-18 lead. Oklahoma
State suffered from poor shooting in the interior and unforced
turnovers in the middle of the floor. The Gators were scoring in
transition and forcing a fast tempo that favored them. And the
Gators also played with a certain attitude. When Desmond Mason of
Oklahoma State crashed to the floor in pain beneath the basket
while on attack, Brent Wright of Florida casually stepped over him
as if Mason were but a puddle on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the second half, Wright exchanged rude shoves
with Brian Montonati and goaded him into a fourth foul that sent
him to the bench. On various rebounding occasions, Harvey _
Florida's freshman forward _ swung an impressive set of elbows.
Later, he began to dunk _ including twice in an 80-second span late
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He opened up the game for us,'' Donovan said. Harvey also had
five rebounds and the Gators dominated the glass by 43-31. But they
did other things well, with skill and aggression that rattled the
Cowboys. When Gottlieb set up Andre Williams for a dunk with a
no-look pass down the lane, Williams clanged the stuff shot off the
rim. When Gottlieb looked clear for a layup on a breakaway, he was
chased down by Miller, who knocked the ball out of his hands.
Moments later, Brett Nelson of Florida turned a Cowboys turnover
into a fast-break dunk that was preceded by a behind-the-back whirl
of the ball as he elevated.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, Florida increased the lead to 17 before
Oklahoma State went on a 20-6 run run to cut the deficit to 3
points with eight minutes left. But the Cowboys never got closer
than that. In the final seconds, when almost everyone stood still
and waited for the buzzer, Kenyan Weaks, the only senior on the
Florida team, waltzed down the lane for a gratuitous dunk. Couldn't
he have saved that for the next game?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told to hold the ball,'' Weaks said. ``But I was intent
on doing something else.''

   SERGIYEV POSAD, Russia _ As a sudden blizzard added unexpected
drama to Russia's presidential elections, voters strolling through
the grounds of the Trinity Monastery of St. Sergius summed up the
reasons why Vladimir Putin would be elected Russia's next leader.
</P>
<P>
   Many said they liked him for his decisiveness. Others applauded
his discipline, his energy or his relative youth.
</P>
<P>
   But a voter named Vladimir, standing by the steps of the Trinity
Cathedral, was the most succinct, offering a reason that had a very
Russian ring to it, like the croaking of the ravens in the bare
trees, or the clanging of the monastery's bells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do I support Putin?'' said the blond, blue-eyed defense
worker, who politely declined to give his last name. ``Because he
is the person who, at this given moment, has real power.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Putin bandwagon that has already rolled across the
political landscape in the last few months, gathering up governors,
mayors, business leaders, military officers and Orthodox priests,
pulled up Sunday at voting stations around the country, offering
the airtight logic of an anointed succession.
</P>
<P>
   The Putin phenomenon _ local shorthand for the extraordinary
eight-month political odyssey of a once undistinguished KGB agent _
has been traced to many sources: the war in Chechnya, the Russian
longing for a strong hand.
</P>
<P>
   But one factor, often overlooked, is the equally strong yearning
for stability at the top, even when it means maintaining a much
maligned status quo.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain that the heir of a president as despised and
scorned as Boris Yeltsin in his last years could emerge with such
popularity? How else could an inexperienced politician consolidate
Russia's political elite in such a short time?
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir was ready to elaborate. ``Putin is our acting president
and, in the three months since our former president resigned, he
has had control over all the leadership, all the military forces,
all the economists,'' he said, speaking with the slow precision of
someone reporting to his boss. ``And look. He has already met with
Madeleine Albright, and with that what's-his-name, Blair.''
</P>
<P>
   He might as well have added that the Putins have already settled
into the Kremlin, and that it would be a pity to waste money in
making them move.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as the Kremlin in the last few weeks stepped up its
campaign to propel its candidate into office on the first round of
voting, the cost of a second round _ estimated by one Putin
supporter as the cost of one month of pension checks in Moscow and
the surrounding region _ became a factor, which was mentioned by
several voters interviewed Sunday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Sergiyev Posad, 40 miles from Moscow, on the grounds of the
monastery built to honor one of Russian Orthodoxy's most revered
saints, Sergius of Radonezh, and at the site of a famous call to
arms in 1380 against the Tatars by Prince Dmitri, Putin was also
getting high marks for his appeal to Russian patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksei Yermelayev, a 47-year-old construction worker, views
Putin as the man who can best take Russia out of the chaos that he
now sees around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the country is on the edge of collapse,'' he said. ``Look
at Chechnya. Yes, the war is cruel, our soldiers are dying, theirs
too, and the civilian population is suffering. But that was a
situation that couldn't continue.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong state that Putin keeps promising means to Yermelayev
a chance for Russia to hold its own among the world's other leading
nations. ``It means not going around like some kind of beggar,
begging for loans and credits that have been suffocating our
country,'' he said. ``But it doesn't mean taking up arms. It means
Russia reshaping its own identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what Putin will do with his power, once it is reaffirmed
by popular mandate, was not clear to many voters. Those who were
backing his opponents _ most of them opting either for Grigory
Yavlinsky, the liberal democratic leader of Yabloko, or Gennady
Zyuganov, the Communist Party leader _ were still calling Putin a
dark horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can someone who has no program be elected president?''
asked Alexander Dyomin, a 47-year-old plumber _ who voted for
Yavlinsky this year, just as he did four years ago _ as he came out
of the polling station in the center of town.
</P>
<P>
   And even those who supported Putin could only guess at his
economic program, which has yet to be written, let alone made
public. ``He will continue the Yeltsin course, although he may make
some changes,'' said Igor, a Moscow factory director.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Tatyana, when asked what changes the couple _ both
Putin supporters _ expect from their candidate, responded:
``Changes for the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Gennady Shubarov, a 35-year-old chauffeur who was visiting the
monastery with his daughter, Katya, 9, said he had voted for Putin
because he was certain that Putin would do nothing to disturb the
fragile rights of Russia's small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, he will continue Yeltsin's program,'' Shubarov
said, noting that his wife was the entrepreneur of the family.
``And of course, that is a good thing.''

WEBB RUNS AND HIDES FROM LPGA'S BEST 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. _ Karrie Webb's final-round victory lap
here Sunday included an encore at the fifth hole, where she made a
hole-in-one to provide an exclamation point to a remarkable run.
</P>
<P>
   Victory was a formality for Webb, who took an eight-stroke lead
over Dottie Pepper into the final round of the Nabisco
Championship, then won by a tournament-record 10 strokes with a
14-under 274 total.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd have had one heck of a tournament if not for Karrie
Webb,'' said Pepper, who finished second, one stroke ahead of Meg
Mallon.
</P>
<P>
   This was Webb's fourth victory this year in five LPGA starts and
her fifth victory in six starts over all in 2000. It was also her
second straight victory in a major championship (she won the du
Maurier Classic in 1999) and her 19th victory in four-plus years on
the Ladies Professional Golf Association Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a good feeling, a rewarding feeling, for all the
hard work I've put in,'' said the 25-year-old Webb, who celebrated
in the traditional way, by jumping into the water at the 18th
green, where she was joined by her caddie, Evan Minster, and the
singer Celine Dion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to win golf tournaments. I love to be in the situation
I put myself in today, and four or five other times this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The only unanswered question entering the final round was how
13-year-old Aree Wongluekiet would fare playing in the final group
in a major championship. She was undone not by the pressure, but by
her own carelessness, incurring a two-stroke penalty when she
inadvertently and unknowingly caused her ball to move with her
putter on the 14th green and failed to replace it before hitting
her next putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking at the hole, and apparently the ball moved maybe
an eighth of an inch,'' Wongluekiet said. ``I didn't see it, but TV
did. I didn't replace the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than shooting a 73 and finishing in a tie for sixth, she
shot a 75 and finished in a tie for 10th, which did nothing to
dampen anyone's enthusiasm in assessing her skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's an amazing talent,'' Webb said. ``On the first hole, she
ripped it off the tee straight down the middle, and I was impressed
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   It was all that prevented Webb from claiming a monopoly on
impressiveness here. Webb shot a two-under-par 70 in the final
round and earned $187,500. It was her fourth straight round under
par on the difficult Dinah Shore course at Mission Hills Country
Club.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper, the defending champion, was playing despite an aching
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payback is hell,'' said Pepper, who won by six strokes a year
ago and holed shots from the fairway twice this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Although Webb eliminated the drama with Saturday's round of
five-under 67, she delivered excitement Sunday with an ace on the
170-yard, par-3 fifth hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost didn't see it go in,'' Webb said. ``When it landed, I
saw it roll up pretty close. I bent down to pick up my tee and
heard Evan say, `Go in.' I looked up and saw it fall in the hole.
When things are going good for you, they're going good.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb's lead grew to 11 strokes through 16 holes Sunday. No one
threatened to make a move on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``After such a good start, I did wonder if I'd peaked a little
too early,'' Webb said of her season. ``But there wasn't anything I
could do about that. I played tremendously the first three days.
Today I was more excited to just get into the clubhouse and hold
the trophy. I'm extremely happy with what I've done this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Given her play, Webb was asked if she is capable of winning this
year's four major tournaments _ the Nabisco, the LPGA Championship,
the United States Women's Open and the du Maurier _ for which
Nabisco offers a $2.5 million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess anything's possible,'' Webb said. ``But I think
they've got a pretty safe bet.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb will take a month off, returning at the Chick-fil-A Charity
Championship starting April 28. The question is, will she lose
momentum with inactivity? With six victories in 1999 and four in
2000, it would seem that Webb has taken her game to a level she can
sustain.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got it going, you've got it going,'' Pepper said.
``You have to sit back and admire her golf. She's getting it in the
hole faster than anybody else.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Michigan State is only No. 1 seed to survive, joined by Florida,
North Carolina and Wisconsin
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If history is an indicator, Michigan State should like
its chances Saturday when it is joined by three surprise teams at
the NCAA Final Four in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State is the only No. 1 seed to make it, along with
fifth-seeded Florida and a pair of No. 8 seeds, Wisconsin and North
Carolina, that have a combined 26 losses.
</P>
<P>
   Only six previous times since the tournament went to 64 teams in
1985 has a lone No. 1 advanced to Final Four. Four of those times,
that No. 1 won the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   But given the craziness of this tournament, just about anything
could happen at the RCA Dome. Here is an early preview of
Saturday's games.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State vs. Wisconsin: The Big Ten teams have played
three times since Feb. 12, with Michigan State winning them all _
Wisconsin's only losses in that time. Only one of those games was
decided by more than nine points.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first time two teams from the same conference
have met in the national semifinals since Illinois and Michigan
tangled in 1989. Michigan won that game 83-81 and went on to beat
Seton Hall in overtime for the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin has already beaten one No. 1 seed, eliminating Arizona
in the second round. Michigan State rallied from substantial
deficits to win its last two games over Syracuse and second-seeded
Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   Florida vs. North Carolina: Florida earned its second trip to
the Final Four since 1994 by beating Oklahoma State 77-65 Sunday in
the East Regional final in Syracuse, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators were almost eliminated in the first round but scored
at the buzzer to beat 12th-seeded Butler 69-68 in overtime. Since
then, Florida has been playing inspired basketball, including a win
over top-seeded Duke in Friday's semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   After North Carolina finished the regular season at 18-13, some
wondered if the Tar Heels would even make the tournament field. But
Sunday they knocked off Tulsa 59-55 to advance to their 15th Final
Four in school history and the third in four years. It was quite a
moment of vindication for coach Bill Guthridge; some Tar Heels fans
had been calling for him to be replaced.

RANGERS PLAYING AS IF THEIR SEASON HAS ALREADY ENDED 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Forget the final five games of the regular season. The
New York Rangers have already quit.
</P>
<P>
   They still cling to dim playoff hopes, according to the
standing. Realistically, they have little chance after their 8-2
drubbing in Detroit, which demonstrated again why the Rangers have
dissolved into a $61 million mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, the atmosphere at Madison Square Garden could be
ugly when the Red Wings visit to complete the home-and-home series.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing positive out there,'' the Rangers' Brian
Leetch said. ``It was an embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   The defeat was the Rangers' fourth straight, dropping them eight
games under .500. The Rangers are 1-7-1 over the last nine games.
Since the All-Star Game break, the Rangers are 6-14-4 and seem
assured of missing the Stanley Cup playoffs for the third
consecutive season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was the longest game I've ever played in,'' Adam Graves
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who allowed the most goals since March 24, 1996 (an
8-2 Penguins romp), are 3 points behind Montreal for the final
Eastern Conference playoff berth. But the situation is dire because
three teams are ahead of the Rangers, who have the fewest number of
games remaining (5).
</P>
<P>
   Mike Richter was magnificent in the first period, stopping all
but one of Detroit's 22-shot barrage. But you got the sense that
Richter was only delaying the inevitable collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit scored 5 goals in the second period on 11 shots; the
Rangers had 5 shots on goal. Martin Lapointe, who had not scored in
15 games, finished off his first National Hockey League hat trick
with two second-period goals.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Shanahan, Steve Yzerman, Sergei Fedorov, Tomas Holdstrom
and Nicklas Lidstrom also scored for the Red Wings, who scored six
consecutive goals to take a 7-1 lead. Leetch and Graves scored for
the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers hit no one, leaving both goalies _ Richter (who left
after two periods) and Kirk McLean _ at the mercy of the Red Wings,
who skated through and around defenders like they were standing
still.
</P>
<P>
   The team's two biggest free-agent signings _ Theo Fleury and
Valery Kamensky _ again were invisible on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Despite two power-play goals, the Rangers were unable to score
with the man-advantage at the most crucial time _ after major and
game misconduct penalties were assessed to Larry Murphy for
spearing Fleury 14 minutes 19 seconds into the game.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the major expired , the Rangers had not only not
scored, they had been outshot by the short-handed Red Wings, 5-3.
After one period, the game was tied at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   And Richter had done all he could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the intermission, we talked about helping out our
goaltender,'' said Leetch. ``And it got even worse.''
</P>
<P>
   How, the Rangers' captain was asked, does a team respond to such
a beating?
</P>
<P>
   ``Start over tomorrow,'' Leetch said.
</P>
<P>
   Wait until seems more likely route.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers entered the season thin at center, a weakness that
was again underscored Sunday. With Coach John Muckler refusing to
play Alexandre Daigle (a healthy scratch for the third straight
game), Fleury, a lifelong right wing, started the game at center
just three days after he and Muckler had agreed it was best for
Fleury to stay at a wing.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, an irate Fleury stormed out of the dressing room for
the second time in three games. When asked if he had a minute to
answer some questions, Fleury said, ``For what? I've got nothing to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleury _ who alternated at wing and center while Muckler
double-shifted Petr Nedved _ took just three shifts in the third
period. That was three more than Kamensky, who was nailed to the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``As badly as we got beat, it's the same guys that work hard,''
said Muckler. ``It's been the same guys all year long. Nothing
changes. It's the same guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Muckler said there was no need to name names. But he did single
out three he thought played well today: Mike York, Stephane Quintal
and Rich Pilon.
</P>
<P>
   These Rangers were built like a rotisserie team consisting of
high-priced veterans who looked good together on paper but had
showed little chemistry on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Even among his staunchest supports, there is little doubt that
Muckler will return next season. The question is whether team
president and general manager Neil Smith will be back. Smith has
been promoting the Rangers' bright future since before the season
even began. But no one could have imagined the present would ever
be this bleak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether the guys quit,'' said Richter, who did
not seem to rule out the possibility. ``I do know we have to be
better than this.'' &QL;

CRITICISM OF MAYOR AND POLICE GROWS AFTER FUNERAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A day after violence marred the funeral for the
victim of a police shooting, criticism of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
and the city's Police Department intensified Sunday as the mayor
vigorously defended himself and the police and denounced the
protesters for what he called an ``orchestrated attack.''
</P>
<P>
   At news conferences and in pulpits across the city, the mayor's
political foes seized on the melee as further evidence of what they
described as the mismanagement of a police department that they
said was losing the confidence of New Yorkers, especially in
minority areas, after a string of police-involved shootings of
unarmed men.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani on Sunday vehemently dismissed his critics and praised
the police for having handled the funeral crowds in ``a
professional and restrained way.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the first time the mayor also voiced sympathy for the
family of Patrick M. Dorismond, the 26-year-old black
Haitian-American whose funeral on Saturday was marred by scuffles
among mourners and police officers in which 23 officers and four
civilians were hurt and 27 people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Anthony Vasquez, the undercover narcotics officer who
fatally shot Dorismond during a confrontation outside a bar in
Manhattan on March 16, sent a letter to the family on Saturday
offering his condolences. Asked by reporters about Vasquez's
gesture, Giuliani said it was ``an appropriate expression.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I commend him for doing it,'' the mayor said after marching in
the Greek Independence Day parade in Manhattan, in front of the New
York police band. ``He did it on the basis of a father losing a
son, or a mother losing a son, and I think we all feel that. We all
feel very, very bad whenever a situation occurs in which a parent
loses a child.''
</P>
<P>
   But almost in the same breath, the mayor again cited reports
that Dorismond had assaulted his girlfriend a week before the
shooting, suggesting that his temperament might have led to his
death. The police have said Dorismond angrily rebuffed an
undercover officer's request for marijuana and was shot while
struggling with Vasquez. No weapon or drugs were found on
Dorismond.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is evidence, again evidence _ not yet decided,''
Giuliani said, ``that he engaged in an assault, that he engaged in
the activity that caused the shooting and that he had up until a
week or a week and half ago indicated a strong propensity for doing
that, including punching his girlfriend in the face'' as she held
their 3-year-old child.
</P>
<P>
   From City Hall Park to a small Baptist church in the Bronx to
the evangelical church in Brooklyn where Dorismond worshipped,
anger over the Police Department's actions at the funeral and
Giuliani's response to the shooting remained strong Sunday.

ANGELS STILL LOOKING AT THEIR OPTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ The Anaheim Angels will break camp in Arizona on
Wednesday, then play their final three games of spring training
over the weekend in Anaheim and San Diego as they set up their
pitching rotation.
</P>
<P>
   There are still decisions to be made, but it seems it could set
up like this: Ken Hill will open the season at home against the New
York Yankees next Monday. Kent Bottenfield, who arrived in camp
Sunday, will probably start the second game of the series. And Kent
Mercker is expected to start the third game.
</P>
<P>
   After that, it gets more complicated. The Angels are off
Thursday, April 6, then begin a three-game series against the Red
Sox on Friday, April 7. The starter that day could be one of three
pitchers - Jason Dickson, Brian Cooper or Scott Schoeneweis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of variables still there,'' manager Mike
Scioscia said. ``The only way we can do it is look at our options
and let it play out. There are going to be some tough decisions,
but it's going to make our ballclub better.''
</P>
<P>
   New guy: Bottenfield spent his first day in an Angels uniform
throwing in the bullpen, running in the outfield and meeting his
new teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about the opportunity,'' he said. ``I've heard
nothing but great things from guys who play here and guys who have
played here. I've been told there's an upbeat attitude in the
clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield will get his first start Wednesday against the
Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Pitcher Jarrod Washburn (strained oblique muscle)
threw a simulated game Sunday and will throw another in a couple of
days.... Ramon Ortiz (sore shoulder) will throw in a minor-league
game today in Mesa, Ariz.

CONNECTICUT QUIETLY FOCUSES ON RETURN TO FINAL FOUR 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By LIZ ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. _ In the locker room for the Connecticut women's
basketball team, the words go unspoken now, sacred almost, and
understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've not heard anyone mention the word Final Four, or national
championship even,'' the sophomore forward Tamika Williams said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of Monday's East Regional final against Louisiana
State, the game that could send Connecticut to the Final Four for
the first time in four years, the Huskies turned inward, put on
blinders and wedged in the ear plugs.
</P>
<P>
   It is not taboo to utter their goal, just unnecessary. ``It is
understood this year that we have to win this game,'' the sophomore
forward Asjha Jones said. ``It's not because of the talent we have;
it's the mentality. We're so much more mature and focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut (33-1) is one of four top-seeded regional teams
vying for a spot in the Final Four, joining Tennessee (31-3) in the
Mideast, Louisiana Tech (31-2) in the Midwest and Georgia (32-3) in
the West. Among the challengers of the top-seeded teams, only Texas
Tech (28-4), seeded third in the Mideast, has won a national title,
let alone been to the Final Four. Rutgers, Louisiana State and Penn
State are hoping to change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the season, everybody always talks about
the Final Four like the Holy Grail,'' Connecticut Coach Geno
Auriemma said. ``It's where everybody wants to go; it's what
everybody wants. Everything leads up to that. You're now one step
away from the Final Four.''
</P>
<P>
   A step Auriemma likened to climbing the last 200 yards of Mount
Everest. ``The closer you get to where you really want to go,'' he
said, ``the harder it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee Coach Pat Summitt agreed. ``I think this is always the
most challenging game of the playoff,'' Summitt said Sunday at a
news conference in Memphis, where her team will face Texas Tech on
Monday night. The Lady Vols are trying to return to their sixth
Final Four in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the pressure cooked the Lady Vols. Primed for their
fourth straight national title, they overlooked Duke in the East
Regional final and the Blue Devils beat them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working really hard since that Duke loss last
year,'' Tamika Catchings, Tennessee's national player of the year,
said on Saturday after her team dismantled Virginia in the Mideast
Regional semifinal in Memphis. ``We learned how we've improved, and
what we could've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago in the East Regional final, Connecticut looked
past North Carolina State and went home early as a result. Svetlana
Abrosimova recalled sitting bleary eyed in her hotel room, watching
helplessly at the highlights of the teams going to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like it should be you because you work very hard, but
you didn't make it,'' the junior forward said Sunday. This time
last year, she and her teammates had lost in the Round of 16.
</P>
<P>
   This postseason, unlike the last two years, Connecticut is
healthy and has ravaged its first three opponents. ``I don't know
if anyone in the country is going to derail UConn,'' Louisiana
State Coach Sue Gunter said. ``I see absolutely no weakness, none.
You almost get caught up in watching how fluid they are.''
</P>
<P>
   For the two Louisiana teams left in the Round of 8, it is easy
to get caught up in the sentiments of making the trip to
Philadelphia. Gunter has won 613 games in 36 years as a college
head coach, including 18 years at L.S.U. Despite having coached
longer than any active women's basketball coach, she has never been
to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `Well, what if you never get to the Final Four?'''
said Gunter, 58. ``I've had a great career, jiminy. And it ain't
over yet either.''
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana Tech's players hope to prolong the career of their
coach, Leon Barmore, who has announced he will retire when his
team's season ends. In the Midwest Region, at Kansas City, Mo.,
Louisiana Tech will play second-seeded Penn State for the chance to
give Barmore his 10th trip to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Darling, Penn State's star point guard who made the
winning basket and had 22 points and 11 rebounds to boost the Lions
into the Round of 8 with a 66-65 victory over Iowa State on
Saturday hopes to foil that quest and get her coach, Rene Portland,
back to her hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow's game will be special,'' Barmore said Sunday at his
news conference in Kansas City. ``The players don't think about
Portland-Barmore and they shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   At the West Regional, Rutgers Coach C. Vivian Stringer hopes to
bring her third different team to the Final Four. Her last
appearance was with Iowa in 1993, and her first was as coach of
Cheyney State, in 1982, the first year the women joined the
National Collegiate Athletic Association for basketball. Her
second-seeded Scarlet Knights will play favored Georgia in the late
game in Portland. The Bulldogs are hoping to make their fourth trip
to the Final Four in the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   But winning the regional final would be a new experience for
every Connecticut player. ``If anything, it's good pressure,'' said
point guard Sue Bird, who missed most of last season with a knee
injury. ``The kind that will make us play harder.''
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the Huskies apply fullcourt pressure that stifles
their opponents and induces them into a track meet. While
Connecticut has never faced LSU, which beat Duke on Saturday on the
strength of guard Marie Ferdinand and center DeTrina White, the
Huskies did not seem to care about the name of their opponent.
``You want to concentrate on what you're doing, you look within
yourself,'' Shea Ralph said, ``and stay together.''
</P>
<P>
   Gunter said: ``I don't think they'll overlook anyone. Geno's
done a good job of focusing his kids and not getting them derailed.
They're on a mission.'' &QL;

OPEC TO REACH AGREEMENT ON INCREASING OIL PRODUCTION  
</HEADLINE>
   (Adds 6th graf with plans for June meeting.) 
 (rk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ The Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries is on the verge of an agreement to increase its oil
production limits by about 1.7 million barrels a day, officials
from several oil exporting countries said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the exact numbers are still being debated and the
increase is less than the 2.5 million barrels sought by a Clinton
administration worried about the ramifications of high gasoline
prices, the increase is somewhat larger than many analysts had
expected. It could reduce the price of oil by several dollars a
barrel, but exactly when and whether that gets passed on to the
consumer remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   One senior OPEC official said the increase would almost exactly
reverse the production cuts the cartel agreed upon one year ago,
which sent oil prices soaring and ignited a political uproar in the
United States as U.S. gasoline prices surged to more than $1.60 a
gallon in many cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this number will result in bringing back market
stability,'' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``It is a reasonable increase, a very reasonable increase to make
sure there are reasonable stocks in the second quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was much uncertainty about the final outcome when
OPEC oil ministers meet here on Monday, the official firmly shook
his head.
</P>
<P>
   The oil ministers are also expected to announce plans for a
follow-up meeting in June at which they could choose to raise
production levels again if the price stays near $30 a barrel. Saudi
officials want to get the price down to about $25 a barrel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Iran, OPEC's second largest producer after Saudi Arabia, is
among several countries still opposed to such a big boost in
production. But other OPEC officials predicted that they would
agree on an increase of at least 1.5 million barrels a day _ but
more likely 1.7 million _ levels that have been urged particularly
by the Saudis.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is being discussed is a return of the 1.7 million barrels
that were removed from production last year,'' Kuwait's oil
minister, Sheik Saud Nasser al-Sabah, said in an interview here
Sunday night. Although he described an increase in production as a
move driven by politics rather than economics, he predicted a boost
would be agreed at or close to the levels sought by Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   He also said oil prices were likely to fall. ``The market will
look at this as an increase, and will react by reducing prices,''
the Kuwaiti minister predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The recent surge in gasoline prices has become a major
election-year topic in the United States. Lawmakers in Congress
have lambasted OPEC countries in recent weeks and accused Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait of paying no heed to the United States' role in
rescuing Kuwait from Iraq during the Persian Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, the likely Republican presidential nominee, has
called for a big reduction in gasoline taxes. Vice President Al
Gore, the expected Democratic nominee, has been peppered with
complaints and the Clinton administration waged an intense lobbying
campaign to persuade OPEC countries about a big increase in
production.
</P>
<P>
   Oil ministers from the 11 nations in OPEC will meet here on
Monday to formally discuss the plan. But the countries have already
been talking for weeks and have held intensive meetings here in the
last few days.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts cautioned that the expected increase will probably have
only a modest impact on gasoline prices, probably no more than 10
cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, said Gary N. Ross, president of PIRA Energy Group,
an oil industry consulting firm, the increases would have a
tangible impact and coincide with unexpectedly weak demand for oil
in the first months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have made it clear they want to see lower prices,'' Ross
said, referring to the Saudis. ``They want to get oil out of the
newspaper headlines.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The last two years have shown that oil prices are notoriously
difficult to predict, for OPEC or for anybody else. Few analysts,
if any, expected prices to plunge as low as $11 a barrel one year
ago, just as few if any predicted their abrupt surge to about $28 a
barrel today.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ginoux, head of the oil trading desk at Salomon Smith
Barney in London, said increasing OPEC's quota by 1.7 million
barrels is inherently less than it appears.
</P>
<P>
   That is because OPEC nations are already cheating on their own
restrictions, overshooting their official limit of 23 million
barrels a day by about 1 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that any official increase simply substitutes for
the unofficial cheating, the real increase could be as little as 1
million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   And though cheating could continue at nearly the present pace,
many smaller OPEC producers are already producing at nearly their
current capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Noncompliance can only come now from the big guys, and they
are the ones who are charged with keeping prices up,'' Ginoux said
Sunday. ``If we take the net new supply to be 1 million barrels a
day, I am horribly afraid that this will go to restocking _ and
probably keep prices right where they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Within OPEC, the view is considerably different.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has argued loudly that OPEC should not raise production by
more than about 700,000 or one million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   And even pro-Western countries like Kuwait are worried about a
repeat of the catastrophic decline in prices that occurred after
OPEC raised production modestly in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am worried,'' said al-Sabah. ``The market has already
dropped by $5 a barrel. I don't see any compelling reason to
increase production other than to be political, to be quite
honest.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the total increase in production extends beyond the
official OPEC quotas. Mexico, Norway and Oman, who are not members
of the oil cartel, all joined in with OPEC last year, slashing
their combined production by about 400,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials have already said they plan to raise their
output by as much as 300,000 barrels. Norway said it will decide
the issue after OPEC meets, but it will probably go back to its
earlier levels as well.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that there is Iraq, which is part of OPEC but is
allowed to pump at maximum levels under a system regulated by the
U.N. sanctions program installed after the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq slashed its production to about 700,000 barrels a day last
year, complaining that it couldn't get the parts it needed. But
after conciliatory moves by the United Nations, Iraq announced this
week that it will go back to full production in the next few
months.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials refused to comment Sunday night on OPEC's likely
production increases, saying it would be premature. But although
the increases are less than those advocated by Bill Richardson, the
secretary of energy, the Clinton administration is likely to
express relief.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many OPEC countries that have good relations
with the United States are angry at what they see as the Americans'
heavy-handed pressure in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is strange that the champion of the free market economy is
acting in a way that would put Marxists to shame,'' the daily Saudi
Gazette said in an editorial on threats by Congress to impose
sanctions if OPEC does not raise production. The editorial
denounced the effort as ``an atrocious proposal which violates the
norms of the market and defies common sense.''

SPORTS COLUMN: BILLY DONOVAN'S MOTIVATION AND TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ Billy Donovan was attempting to drum up
sympathy for his young Florida team. The Gators' 34-year-old coach
was making the point about the hazards of recruiting young players
and having them turn professional, leaving the cupboard bare and
all that.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan said that what concerned him about Oklahoma State was
that the Cowboys were a tight, cohesive group of seniors, deep in
experience and valuable frames of reference. His team, freshmen and
sophomores, lacked a deep emotional well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always the danger that the team that's less talented
but has a lot of seniors can beat a young, talented team because
they've been there,'' Donovan said. ``You don't know who's going to
stay and who's going. At one point it's exciting; at another point
it's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, it was exciting.
</P>
<P>
   With just over three minutes remaining in the East Regional
final, 6-foot-8-inch Donnell Harvey _ one of Donovan's freshmen _
swooped down from what seemed the Carrier Dome roof and slammed
home a riveting, Vince Carter-like dunk. Harvey's dunk increased
Florida's lead to 70-57, extinguished what had been a last-gasp
comeback by Oklahoma State and sent out a resounding message.
Florida won, 77-65, to join an eclectic group in Indianapolis next
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators are going to the Final Four, where they will face
North Carolina on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Donovan was so concerned that his players might
not have the emotional reserve to dig deep when the going rough
that he dug deep into his own bag of motivational tricks. He told
each player to choose one person he loved, really loved, and to
dedicate the game to that person. Put that person's name on his
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make it so that when they got tired, when they
looked down, they saw that person's name,'' Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Miller dedicated the game to his family _ two older
brothers, a younger sister and his mother, who drove him to
practice and sometimes rebounded for him. Brent Wright dedicated
the game to his 18 brothers and sisters. Harvey, the middle of
three boys, dedicated the game to his family.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan's tactic worked, or something worked. When Florida
fumbled away a 17-point lead to lead by only 3 with eight minutes
to go, the Gators kicked into gear and sped away. Two foul shots by
Teddy Dupay, two more by Miller, a 3-pointer by Miller, a layup by
Udonis Haslem and, finally, 5 consecutive points by Harvey: a dunk,
a foul shot and that riveting dunk to make it a 13-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, with fans going crazy, his teammates scrambling
to cut down the nets, an unfazed Harvey stood alone, looking as if
he were waiting to buy a ticket to a movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just taking what the defense gave me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Was he excited? ``This was a good victory,'' he said ``It's
special, but we have two more games to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked Harvey if he knew that freshmen were not supposed
to play the way Florida's did. He shrugged. ``Age doesn't matter on
the court,'' he said. ``All that matters is how you play.''
</P>
<P>
   In the span of 48 hours, Donovan had looked two coaching icons
in the eye and beaten them. On Friday, he defeated Mike
Krzyzewski's Duke team and last night he defeated Eddie Sutton's
Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year is only the seventh year in 80 years that the
University of Florida has been to the NCAA tournament,'' Donovan
said. ``It's not a tradition-laden school, but I'm happy there.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the game, his 59-year-old father and his
87-year-old grandfather came down to the court and hugged. What a
scene: the son the coach, proud father and grandfather all locked
in an embrace. Donovan's father, Bill, played at Boston College;
his grandfather, Bill, played in the Navy in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife died last year,'' the eldest Donovan said. ``She
really loved Billy; we used to watch all of his games together.
Something like this helps to take some of the pain away.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally there was Donovan's father, the man responsible for
pushing his son to leave Wall Street and get into coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do what every young kid out of college wanted to
do: I wanted to make a million dollars,'' Donovan remembered. ``I'd
pick up the phone, try to get some guy from Texas to invest money
with me, and I had no idea what I was doing with it anyway. That
was very short-lived for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most athletes, I never thought my career was ever going
to come to an end. I thought I was going to play forever. I had to
sit back and look at my career. My dad always told me that while
you're young, do what you love doing. That's what's going to make
you happy. All the money in the world can't buy happiness. Do what
you love. That hit home to me.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Sunday night, everything worked: the press, the trap, the
motivation, the four generations of Donovans.
</P>
<P>
   Relax and enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Then start all over again Monday.
</P>
<P>
   That's what makes it tough; that's what makes it exciting.

1,500 MARCH IN BOSTON TO PROTEST BIOTECH FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In what organizers called the largest American
demonstration against genetically engineered food, more than 1,500
protesters marched through downtown Boston Sunday and ended up
outside a major biotechnology industry convention, where they
pointed their fingers at the suited scientists watching from the
windows and shouted, ``Shame on you!''
</P>
<P>
   City officials and police officers, concerned about a possible
repeat of the fracas at the protests against the World Trade
Organization in Seattle last fall, had prepared assiduously for the
demonstration. But all passed peacefully in an atmosphere something
like an Earth Day festival.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the demonstration was not wild but wildly creative.
Street theater abounded; several protesters ran around dressed as
white-coated fanatical scientists wielding giant syringes and
several others fluttered about as butterflies to symbolize the
monarchs that a study has shown were harmed by genetically altered
corn. A man in a Frankenstein costume pushed a shopping cart
bearing genetically engineered ``Frankenflakes,'' and another wore
a papier-mache killer tomato on his head.
</P>
<P>
   The protest was timed to coincide with Bio2000, a record-setter
for the other side: Its organizers call it the largest
biotechnology conference in the United States, gathering about
7,000 participants for five days, beginning Monday, to share the
latest news on promising drugs and techniques. Its speakers include
the actor Christopher Reeve and Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In a pre-emptive salvo against the protesters, about 2,000
scientists from around the world, including two Nobel laureates,
signed a ``Declaration in Support of Agricultural Biotechnology,''
said AgBioWorld.com, an advocacy group that released the
declaration on Thursday. It quoted the declaration's organizer, Dr.
C.S. Prakash of Tuskegee University, as saying that ``biotech crops
allow farmers to grow more food on less land with less synthetic
pesticides and herbicides.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few conference participants to venture outside the
convention center to watch the march, Bob Renger, the dean of
sciences of Ventura College in California, said he thought it was
good that ``people are expressing their views and they're doing it
in a peaceful way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think more people will hear them as a consequence,'' Renger
said. But, he said: ``I happen to disagree with what they're
saying. I'm an archaeologist and I know we've been changing the
environment for 10,000 years. The only difference is that we've
speeded up the process that we're changing things.''
</P>
<P>
   He could support the idea of labeling genetically engineered
food, he said, but if people took ``an extreme view,'' it might
stop the benefits coming from improved crops and pharmaceutical
products. ``I'm concerned over unreasonable reaction,'' he said.
``It's not the technology here, it's what people do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   No genetically altered food has been shown to have harmed
people, but opponents say that not enough research has been done to
prove that it is safe. Protesters argued Sunday that the
agricultural biotechnology industry, fueled by greed, was placing
human health _ possibly the health of the biosphere _ at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the people who gave us thalidomide babies,'' Sarah
Seeds, a protester who also trains others to protest nonviolently,
said of the participants in the Bio2000 convention. ``Now they want
to give us genetically modified food.'' Thalidomide, a drug
prescribed for morning sickness, caused deformities in infants in
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the public sentiment against genetically engineered
food reached a ground swell so great that the cultivation and sale
of such food there has all but stopped.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans have remained much more receptive to genetically
engineered crops, which have been altered by techniques that take
some genetic material from another plant or animal and insert it to
produce useful traits like greater resistance to insects. Nearly
two-thirds of the products on American supermarket shelves are
estimated to contain genetically altered crops.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's protest, however, may indicate some swelling in the
opposition. Last December in Oakland, Calif., only a few hundred
people protested a public meeting about bio-engineered food held by
the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the crops.
Sunday, the crowd nearly filled Boston's Copley Square before the
march, and the slogans and arguments seemed to get through to
onlookers like Sathya Rajavelu, a technology manager for a
financial services company who had wandered down to the protest.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Rajavelu said, he thought the conference
participants probably saw the protest as nothing but entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, ``This is a cause that a lot of
people could easily relate to, so they will most likely get on the
bandwagon.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, ``I'm sure there would be at least one person up
there'' _ he gestured at the convention center _ ``who will step
back and say, `Have we been totally carried away with what we
do?'''

KUWAITIS ARE EXASPERATED BY U.S. OIL POLICIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Wearing an impeccably tailored charcoal
pin-striped suit as he relaxed in his sprawling hotel suite here
Sunday night, Sheik Saud Nasser al-Sabah of Kuwait was feeling
distinctly worn out by U.S. politics.
</P>
<P>
   As oil and gasoline prices have soared in the last few months,
members of Congress have charged that Kuwait has been enriching
itself at the expense of U.S. consumers and that it has blithely
forgotten that the United States fought a war to liberate it from
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Now, under heavy U.S. pressure, Kuwait and other members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are reluctantly
planning to raise production and to bring modest relief.
</P>
<P>
   But as Kuwait's oil minister, Saud was far from happy about that
and granted a rare on-the-record interview to The New York Times to
make his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's price is fair and reasonable as far as we are
concerned,'' he said. ``What really made the difference was that in
April 1999 people in the United States could buy gasoline for 98 or
99 cents a gallon. When prices corrected, there was an uproar.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from enjoying an unearned windfall, he asserted, Kuwait was
barely recovering from the disastrous decline in prices in 1998 and
early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we are in an election year,'' the sheik
continued, referring to the U.S. campaigns for president and
Congress. ``We are in a situation where Republicans are trying to
upstage Democrats. We don't want to become entangled in domestic
American politics, but we are becoming entwined.''
</P>
<P>
   This has not been a particularly good decade for oil producers.
Adjusted for inflation, oil prices have consistently slumped far
below the heights reached in OPEC's heyday in the 1970s. Analysts
estimate that OPEC lost about $65 billion in revenue last year as a
result of declines in oil prices, to as low as $11 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   For Kuwait, a tiny country sitting atop some of the world's
biggest oil reserves, the downturn had a huge impact. With 93
percent of its revenues coming from oil, the government's $4.4
billion budget was short $2 billion in both 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``To balance our budget, we need to sell Kuwaiti oil at about
$21 or $22 a barrel,'' said Saud. ``We're not even talking about a
surplus. Is that too much to ask for?''
</P>
<P>
   The talks in Vienna this year have been unusually sensitive
because oil prices have nearly tripled in the last 12 months and
U.S. gasoline prices have soared from about $1 to well over $1.60
in many cities.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest producer and the country that
overshadows all other OPEC members, has been the leading proponent
for an increase in production of about 1.7 million barrels a day.
Kuwait and other Gulf states like the United Arab Emirates and
Qatar have been less enthusiastic but prepared to follow the Saudi
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is completely exaggerated,'' Saud contended, for Americans
to complain that Kuwait is ungrateful for U.S. willingness to lead
the Persian Gulf war and to force Iraq out of Kuwait after its
invasion in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had the United States not intervened to help Kuwait then,
Kuwait would not have any oil to export now,'' he said. ``We don't
want to harm the United States. We just want to defend our own
interests.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Thursday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill
that would urge the administration to consider cutting off aid and
military sales to OPEC countries that try to push up oil prices by
constraining demand.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has opposed the bill, arguing that it is much
too heavy-handed. But the energy secretary, Bill Richardson, has
toured the capitals of many oil-exporting countries in the last few
weeks in an effort to persuade them of the need for big increases
in oil production.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that oil prices could take another plunge is not the
least of the sheik's worries. Two years ago, prices plunged after
OPEC agreed on modest increases in production. A year ago they
soared far beyond all expectations after new cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, prices have once again started sinking,
though at $28 a barrel on Friday they were at levels that most
producers would consider close to nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to know,'' the sheik said, ``What price do the
Americans consider acceptable? We feel as if we are between a rock
and a hard place.''

TALK.COM PLANS TO ACQUIRE ACCESS ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk.com, a provider of long-distance telephone services,
announced Sunday it would buy Access One, a privately held local
telephone company that operates in nine Southeastern states, in a
stock deal valued around $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Talk.com has made clear that it wants to expand into local
service. The company expects to offer local calling in New York
State in the next few months. And though Gabriel Battista,
Talk.com's chairman, said that he was not yet in discussions with
other companies, he said that Talk.com was looking closely at other
small local phone providers as possible acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers will want to deal with one company for local and
long-distance services,'' Battista said, ``and this deal is
jump-starting us in nine states'' _ Alabama, Florida, Georgia,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina
and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   By buying Access One, which had revenue of about $50 million
last year, Talk.com gets 55,000 local-service customers in
BellSouth territory, as well as local service it can offer the
300,000 long-distance customers it has in the area. Most of Access
One's customers are small businesses, while most of Talk.com's
customers are residential, so there is little overlap in customer
bases.
</P>
<P>
   And though the combined customer base is still a fraction of the
27 million telephone users in the region, Battista says the new
company will easily garner more. ``Talk.com,'' he said, ``is a
marketing machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk.com has been around for 10 years, but has had a huge growth
spurt over the last six months. In March of last year, it had one
million subscribers for its long-distance services; by December,
the figure was 1.5 million. The company, which lost $2 a share in
1998 _ in part because of skyrocketing marketing expenses, Battista
said _ earned 90 cents a share, or about $58 million, on $515
million in revenue in 1999. It has transferred much of its
marketing to the Internet, a far lower-cost way to sell.
Stockholders remain skeptical. Talk.com's shares, although they
rose above $22 in December for a few hours, traded around $17 for
most of last year. The shares closed at $14.5625 on Friday.

ANOTHER CALL FOR THE QUARTERBACK OF POLITICAL PERSUASION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If William M. Daley ever needs to be reminded why
President Clinton made him secretary of commerce, he need only hike
across his office. On the far wall of the great rectangle, past the
sofas, the generous hearth and the boardroom dining table, hangs a
small photograph of the Oval Office with Daley and Clinton standing
shoulder-to-shoulder inside. Inscribed across the bottom, in
Clinton's curly scrawl, is a note of thanks to Daley for heading
the Lazarus Project.
</P>
<P>
   In the Clinton era, such biblical code is reserved for sensitive
political missions. Daley headed one of Clinton's most successful:
getting the North America Free Trade Agreement through a wary
Congress in 1993. Daley, then working as a lawyer, was hired to
salvage Nafta from what was seen as probable defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought I raised it from the dead,'' Daley said one recent
afternoon, explaining how the project got its name and how he, a
bit reluctantly, got his niche. ``I enjoy the politics stuff, but
you do get pounded with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Day to day, Daley oversees Commerce duties like forecasting
weather, counting how many people live in America, promoting United
States goods abroad and collecting data on the national economy.
But despite a self-conscious effort to thrive as a wonk _ as second
son of the Chicago mayoral dynasty, he hopes to be remembered for
something other than campaign savvy _ Clinton uses him as political
offensive coordinator, especially when it is third and long.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the twilight of Clinton's presidency as in its dawn,
Daley is driving a White House legislative crusade. Along with
Steven Richetti and a team of aides in every corner of the
executive branch, Daley heads the effort to persuade Congress to
grant China permanent normal trade relations. Clinton has called it
his top remaining foreign policy goal. Daley, however he handles
this year's census, has his reputation riding on a ``yes'' vote.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nafta, it is an uphill struggle. Union pressure on
Democrats, Republican loyalties to Taiwan and bipartisan concerns
about human rights abuses have turned many lawmakers against
extending permanent trading rights to China. Daley calls the vote
too ``mushy'' to predict.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterbacking comes instinctively to Daley, who is 51. Like
his father and his brother, the past and present Chicago mayors,
politics runs in his blood. White House officials said Clinton
trusts Daley's political intuition more than that of anyone else in
the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   With brother Richard always first in line to fill the family
shoes in Chicago, Daley practiced law at the Chicago office of
Mayer, Brown &AMP; Platt and sought his fortune in national politics,
working for Walter F. Mondale and Michael S. Dukakis before joining
Clinton's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The hoped-for payoff, a cabinet post, did not materialize in the
first Clinton administration. But in early 1993 he was asked to
move into the Old Executive Office Building next to the White House
and mobilize support for Nafta. It was a paltry consolation prize _
his friend Dan Rostenkowski, then the powerful Ways and Means
chairman from Illinois, called him crazy for accepting _ but Nafta
squeaked through Congress. And after the commerce secretary, Ronald
H. Brown, died in a 1996 plane crash, Daley was offered the post.
</P>
<P>
   In an administration with many workaholics, Daley is known as an
especially sober worker bee. His wife remains in Chicago, where
their children are in school. He says it is easier that way because
he is usually at the office when not on the road. He keeps the same
long hours investment bankers do and dresses like they used to. His
close-cut blue suits and pinched shirt collars make him look prim
even by Washington's atavistic standards of attire.
</P>
<P>
   Daley would clearly prefer to enjoy the challenges and trappings
of Commerce secretary than the grind of a six-month legislative
campaign. He said he is especially proud of little-noted
achievements, like straightening out accounting practices in
Commerce's many departments. With trademark deadpan, he said he
hopes his legacy will be ``getting out of here without hiring a
lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet over a working lunch (chicken noodle soup in a plastic foam
bowl, Diet Coke from a can) in his Olympic-pool-sized office, Daley
says that shaping the China debate and cajoling members of Congress
has become his new full-time job. His strategy: Link China trade to
America's national security and the fate of China's reformers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economics of this are great,'' he says. ``But if this
fight stays on economics, we lose. It has to be about Chinese
politics, Taiwan and our position in the world. It's a big vote.
Congress is just going to have to walk the plank.''
</P>
<P>
   To manage the process, Daley moved David Lane, his chief of
staff, across the Mall to the White House. There, they set up a
``war room'' that monitors everything China and commands a
remarkable chunk of Clinton's own schedule. He makes sure nearly
every nanobyte of good news about bilateral relations _ a
first-time export of oranges, China's decision to release the names
of some political prisoners _ gets out to the press.
</P>
<P>
   But Daley spends most of his time in one-on-one meetings with
members of Congress. Some days he sees as many as six or seven
members in their offices. He is taking 30 of them on an Air Force
jet to China next month on a three-city, six-day lobbying tour that
includes meeting with leaders in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Will it work? Daley's efforts to get Congress to approve
fast-track trade negotiating powers failed recently. But, having
been through Nafta, he seems cautiously optimistic that he will
prevail on China.
</P>
<P>
   If not, he begs, only half in jest, please remember what he did
to improve bookkeeping at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.

   SUITLAND, Md. _ A century ago, the plight of the Native
Americans had reached a nadir. Their population had been decimated
by war; their culture, in its way, was no less under assault. A
single-minded man with a formidable appetite for collecting other
peoples' treasures was buying up Indian artifacts, literally by the
boxcar, in shopping sprees throughout North America and South
America.

bow-and-arrow armories, a business tycoon named George Gustav Heye
spent more than half a century accumulating a collection that is
stunning both for its quality, touched with peerless beadwork and
gold crafting, and for its volume.
</P>
<P>
   Heye left more than 800,000 objects when he died in 1957, plus a
photo archive of 86,000 images of Indian life. And now this
treasure trove is being quietly trucked from a Bronx warehouse to
the Smithsonian Institution's new Cultural Resources Center here,
amid the awe and scrutiny of specialists from the surviving U.S.
tribes, whose population has rebounded in this country from 250,000
a century ago to nearly two million.
</P>
<P>
   A renaissance of sorts is at hand with each truckload of
cultural treasure and each visit from tribal scholars and elders,
who can pause in their gratitude at the drifting smoke of a
smudging ritual in one of the center's ceremonial side rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the truck deliveries are valued at $50 million by the
insurers who protect this weekly cultural portage with security
guards. But the Heye collection in its entirety is priceless as it
arrives to become the core of the new National Museum of the
American Indian, scheduled to open late next year on the Mall in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of time, Heye has come to be honored for his
relentless, loving foray into Indian culture _ even, lately, by the
tribal leaders who are helping to plan the museum. Their
specialists are finding the objects in pristine condition, tangible
evidence of a grand tradition. The growing excitement surrounding
the new museum is personified by its founding director, W. Richard
West Jr., a veteran Washington lawyer and Indian affairs lobbyist
who is a member of the Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heye has gifted a nation,'' West said, 40 years after first
seeing some of the Heye collection. When he was a teen-ager making
his first visit east from Oklahoma, his father took him to a small
museum in upper Manhattan that only the most knowledgeable tourists
knew to visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was almost overwhelmed by the volume and quality of the
Cheyenne material I saw,'' West recalled. ``But I also had this
other impression of `why is all this here and all of us Cheyennes
out there either in Oklahoma or Montana?' And `who is telling
people about what this material means?'''
</P>
<P>
   The new museum, the last the Smithsonian will build on the mall
to tell the story of America, is being designed to answer those
questions in close cooperation with the tribes. ``We're just
figuring out our answers,'' said West, who is overseeing the task
of presenting, at the tourist crossroads of the nation, the story
of more than 1,000 Native American communities in the Indians'
words. The tribes encompass the hemisphere from the Arctic circle
to Tierra del Fuego, as well as a history from the struggles of the
past to those of the present.
</P>
<P>
   Mapuche Indians up from Chile were working here Thursday _ two
religious leaders and two scholars consulting on the extensive
collection of objects from their tribal past. Visitors from the
Lakota nation, one of 40 whose treasures will be featured in the
opening exhibitions next year, have been working in another corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a process of community curation,'' West said. ``The
native people themselves have something authentic and worthy to say
about the objects in our collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be through natives' eyes, minds and hearts that
visitors are introduced to this vast store of cultural patrimony.''
</P>
<P>
   After the new museum opens, the Smithsonian will continue to
operate the separate Heye Center museum, which has been open for
the past five years in the historic U.S. Custom House in lower
Manhattan. In inviting close tribal cooperation, the museum board
sought to ease long-running grievances by adopting a repatriation
policy in 1991 so human remains and sacred material could be
returned to the tribes, as well as objects illegally obtained in
the Indian wars.
</P>
<P>
   The research center in this Washington suburb is open to tribal
specialists and limited numbers of casual visitors, who will soon
be able to use computerized research rooms. The three-story
building has state-of-the-art storage. It also has curatorial
equipment to clean and itemize every object with bar codes and
digital imaging.
</P>
<P>
   The five-story mall museum will be faced clifflike with Kasota
limestone and topped with a copper dome. It will cost $110 million,
with the tribes contributing one-third of the money and the
government financing the rest.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   West said estimates are that more than 5 million people a year
will visit. He welcomes the chance to contradict all manner of
stereotypes, from the notion that all Indians are the war-bonneted
plains natives depicted in movies to the impression that native
tribes are near extinction. More than 40 million Native Americans
live in the two hemispheres, he noted; most of them are in Central
America and South America, but there are also 558 federally
recognized tribes in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Though bedeviled in recent centuries by near annihilation,
broken land treaties and enforced reservation life, those tribes
have histories that go back tens of thousands of years. West
emphasized that this time frame would provide the larger context
for the museum's exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 19th century was not a particularly pleasant chapter of
our history, and I think we have to talk about that in an honest,
informed and direct way,'' he said of the tribal wars with European
settlers. ``But museums should be safe havens for controversial
discussions. And the 19th century is hardly the sum total of the
tribes' existence here or their cultural contribution.''

CRITICISM OF MAYOR AND POLICE GROWS AFTER FUNERAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Expands earlier story with additional grafs at end, beginning
with ``At a rally ...'') 
(lb) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A day after violence marred the funeral for the
victim of a police shooting, criticism of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
and the city's Police Department intensified Sunday as the mayor
vigorously defended himself and the police and denounced the
protesters for what he called an ``orchestrated attack.''
</P>
<P>
   At news conferences and in pulpits across the city, the mayor's
political foes seized on the melee as further evidence of what they
described as the mismanagement of a police department that they
said was losing the confidence of New Yorkers, especially in
minority areas, after a string of police-involved shootings of
unarmed men.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani on Sunday vehemently dismissed his critics and praised
the police for having handled the funeral crowds in ``a
professional and restrained way.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the first time the mayor also voiced sympathy for the
family of Patrick M. Dorismond, the 26-year-old black
Haitian-American whose funeral on Saturday was marred by scuffles
among mourners and police officers in which 23 officers and four
civilians were hurt and 27 people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Anthony Vasquez, the undercover narcotics officer who
fatally shot Dorismond during a confrontation outside a bar in
Manhattan on March 16, sent a letter to the family on Saturday
offering his condolences. Asked by reporters about Vasquez's
gesture, Giuliani said it was ``an appropriate expression.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I commend him for doing it,'' the mayor said after marching in
the Greek Independence Day parade in Manhattan, in front of the New
York police band. ``He did it on the basis of a father losing a
son, or a mother losing a son, and I think we all feel that. We all
feel very, very bad whenever a situation occurs in which a parent
loses a child.''
</P>
<P>
   But almost in the same breath, the mayor again cited reports
that Dorismond had assaulted his girlfriend a week before the
shooting, suggesting that his temperament might have led to his
death. The police have said Dorismond angrily rebuffed an
undercover officer's request for marijuana and was shot while
struggling with Vasquez. No weapon or drugs were found on
Dorismond.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is evidence, again evidence _ not yet decided,''
Giuliani said, ``that he engaged in an assault, that he engaged in
the activity that caused the shooting and that he had up until a
week or a week and half ago indicated a strong propensity for doing
that, including punching his girlfriend in the face'' as she held
their 3-year-old child.
</P>
<P>
   From City Hall Park to a small Baptist church in the Bronx to
the evangelical church in Brooklyn where Dorismond worshipped,
anger over the Police Department's actions at the funeral and
Giuliani's response to the shooting remained strong Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally in Flatbush, Brooklyn, the Rev. Al Sharpton joined
other speakers in calling for a federal monitor to oversee the
department, though he stopped short of blaming the police for
Saturday's confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's make it clear that the Haitian community of Flatbush
marched over three miles down Flatbush Avenue, no windows were
broken and there was no violence,'' Sharpton said. ``When we were
inside the church, there were reports that police with riot gear
were coming forth, which we had asked them not to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said the Giuliani administration had moved too quickly
to blame the demonstrators for the violence, and he challenged the
mayor and the police commissioner, Howard Safir, to ``name the
demagogues'' who they said sparked the confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   The state comptroller, H. Carl McCall, said at a news conference
Sunday, ``The mayor is incapable or unwilling to deal with this
crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The simmering hostility between residents and the police in many
quarters led McCall, who as comptroller is the highest black
elected official in the state, to send a letter to the governor on
March 23 asking him to set up a commission to study ways to improve
relations among police officers and residents, with a focus on but
not limited to New York City.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At around the same time on Sunday, the city's public advocate,
Mark Green, reiterated his demand, first made a year ago, that
Safir resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never urged any other Giuliani appointee to resign,'' he
said. ``But Howard Safir is an exceptional case. I'm not
criticizing the cops but rather the commissioner, whose policies
have failed to accomplish what commissioners in Boston, San Diego
and other cities have _ less crime and less misconduct
simultaneously.''
</P>
<P>
   And C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, at a
separate rally with the Black Ministers Conference of Greater New
York, demanded federal oversight of the police and urged the U.S.
attorney's office in Brooklyn, which is conducting a broad civil
rights inquiry into the department, to release its findings. An
aide to the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, Loretta Lynch, declined to
comment Sunday.

ANALYSIS: GUILIANI SEEMS TO BE RUNNING AGAINST SHARPTON-CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's handlers could have
their way, his opponent in this year's United States Senate race
would be Hillary Sharpton Clinton. But since Clinton's surname is
Rodham, not Sharpton, the mayor's aides are doing everything they
can to create the perception that she and the minister from Harlem
are siblings in spirit, if not in blood.
</P>
<P>
   In campaign fliers and in public comments, the mayor and his
advisers have stopped just short of portraying the Rev. Al Sharpton
as a political Beelzebub who advises an attentive Clinton in ways
that, if she is elected, would set the republic on the path to
perdition. In fact, they have recently begun to respond to any
criticism of the mayor's actions by throwing out one name:
Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Giuliani's campaign manager, Bruce Teitelbaum,
referred to ``her pal Al Sharpton'' in responding to Clinton's
charge that the mayor had too quickly sided with the police in the
fatal shooting of an unarmed black man by a police officer on the
West Side of Manhattan nearly two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the mayor continued his derogatory portrayal of
the dead man, Patrick Dorismond, and, to counter Clinton's charge
that he was engaging in racial polarization, said she was ``reading
from a script provided by Al Sharpton.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, after the Rev. Jesse Jackson referred to the mayor
as ``mental,'' Curt Ritter, a spokesman for the mayor, spread the
wealth of guilt-by-association among several Democrats: ``Jesse
Jackson, Dov Hikind and Alan Hevesi have joined the political
pile-on team being captained by Al Sharpton in the name of Hillary
Clinton.'' That same night, Teitelbaum appeared on CNN's ``Inside
Politics'' program to share a thought about the Clinton campaign:
Sharpton, Sharpton, Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   By the weekend, the association had become an assumed element of
the political debate _ assisted along the way by Giuliani campaign
fliers warning Republican leaders around the state about the ``Al
Sharpton wing'' of the Democratic Party. After the funeral for
Dorismond on Saturday turned into a melee between protesters and
the police, the mayor could afford to be vague when laying blame on
unnamed ``demagogues.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the mayor's usually available advisers did not answer
repeated requests to discuss the Giuliani campaign's constant
invocation of Sharpton's name. And yesterday the mayor denied that
he often brought up Sharpton's association with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't,'' he told a reporter. He then added: ``I don't
know, you just brought it up. So now if I talk about it you are
going to accuse me of bringing it up all the time. So I am not a
sucker.''
</P>
<P>
   Political consultants say the tactic is elementary politics.
Polls suggest that Sharpton, perceived by some as inflicting as
many wounds as he heals, is particularly unpopular among Jewish
voters, and his inextricable link to race-based politics may offend
in the overwhelmingly white electorate in upstate New York. Any
voters lured from the Democratic camp by linking Clinton to
Sharpton could be the margin of victory in a neck-and-neck race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor wants to get off the police brutality issue, so he
moves it on to a person who, polls say, generates negative feelings
in the minds of Jewish voters,'' said Norman Adler, a consultant
who works for both Republicans and Democrats. ``It's one of the
oldest political strategies in the book: never defend if you can
attack, and always attack in a place where they're soft.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Adler said, Giuliani's advisers see softness in
Clinton's recent appearances with Sharpton. ``They have the TV tape
of Clinton and the Reverend Sharpton,'' he said. ``Bingo! Instant
commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   But several people, black and white alike, said that although
attacking someone for the company she keeps was a familiar tactic,
Giuliani approaches dangerous ground by using Sharpton as his foil
so freely. The mayor has virtually no friends among the city's
black leaders, a reality that does not seem to bother him. In
addition, many blacks say they are too often the victims of his
administration's aggressive police tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is Dorismond, killed March 16 under hazy
circumstances after reacting angrily to an undercover officer who
approached him with a request to buy drugs from him. For many, the
incident recalls surnames other than Sharpton: Diallo and Louima.
And Giuliani's attempts to offset criticism of the police by
questioning the dead man's temperament have widely been seen as
insensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Such context is not forgotten when Giuliani invokes the Sharpton
name, said Prof. Manning Marable, the director of African-American
studies at Columbia University. ``This is a wedge issue,'' he said.
``Giuliani knows what he is doing. He's a smart politician but an
unprincipled one. And he's doing this for all the worst reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Sharpton has tried without complete success to
distance himself from parts of his own past: his involvement in the
Tawana Brawley case, and his divisive comments after a deadly fire
at a Harlem store whose owner was Jewish. Still, he has emerged as
one of the country's best-known civil rights leaders, leading the
outcry against racial profiling in New Jersey and organizing
protests in the wake of the police shooting death of Amadou Diallo
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gained a respectability and a legitimacy in the black
middle class that 10 years ago would have nothing to do with him,''
Marable said. A Republican strategist agreed: ``Sharpton's a
rehabilitated character.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sharpton is still perceived by some as too quick to condemn
the police, too eager to shout ``Race!'' in time for the evening
news. While running for president earlier this year, Sen. John
McCain lumped him together with Louis Farrakhan, Pat Robertson and
Jerry Falwell as ``agents of intolerance.'' And Giuliani's
antipathy for Sharpton predates his run for the Senate; years ago
there was a spell when the mayor refused even to utter the Sharpton
name.
</P>
<P>
   The minister's ``stock-in-trade is race; that's how he pays his
mortgage,'' said Adler, the political consultant. ``And Sharpton
keeps reminding people about who he is and what he's about, thereby
playing into the mayor's hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Consultants say that as a Democratic candidate banking on the
black vote in New York, Clinton had no choice but to shake hands
with Sharpton, if not embrace him outright. She finally met with
him two months ago at a public event that included an episode that
could have been designed by her opponent's advisers.
</P>
<P>
   At a moment when neither Sharpton nor Clinton was present, a
Queens minister talked about Jews in a way that some found to be
anti-Semitic. Both Sharpton and Clinton quickly denounced the
comments, but the opening for the Giuliani camp had been made. That
night, Teitelbaum declared: ``When you make a decision to attend an
Al Sharpton-sponsored event at Al Sharpton's headquarters, it
shouldn't be a shock when anti-Semitic rhetoric rears its ugly
head.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Giuliani appeared on a dais that also included
Joerg Haider, a right-wing Austrian political figure who has had to
apologize for finding positive things to say about Adolf Hitler.
Clinton tried to embarrass the mayor about the appearance, but the
issue soon evaporated. Haider is in Austria; Sharpton is in New
York.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from a purely political point of view, Adler said that
he saw no cost to the mayor's attempts to conjoin the Clinton and
Sharpton names. ``The mayor is not driving away black votes by
demonizing Al Sharpton because he doesn't have them,'' he said.
``If he would be demonizing Ed Koch, he would risk losing some of
the votes he already has. I would say blacks, Puerto Ricans and
liberals are fair game.''
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Rangel, the Democratic representative from Harlem,
said he found such political rationalizing to be sad _ and classic
Giuliani. ``What an indictment it would be'' not to seek the black
vote, Rangel said. ``And isn't it amazing how he's been able to
distance himself from African-Americans?
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the community that he's appealing to comes at the
expense of African-Americans,'' Rangel added, ``it reaches a point
with them that enough is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Why does the mayor single out Sharpton for demonization? Simple,
Sharpton said: ``He's playing the race card.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To the guy in Buffalo, it's `She's reading from Sharpton's
script' _ which is the blacks,'' Sharpton said. ``What they're
really saying is, `She's with the blacks.'''

   NEW YORK _ Every one of them knew that going there would be
painful. Some, tears welling in their eyes, walked ever so slowly,
their hands shaking at the thought of where they were headed.
Others, buoyed by the warm sun and the companionship of hundreds,
simply burst ahead, past the rubble-strewn lots and the graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   They were, however, determined to be together in front of 1959
Southern Boulevard in the East Tremont section of the Bronx to
remember the loved ones they lost a decade ago, when an enraged
boyfriend armed with a dollar's worth of gasoline set fire to the
crowded Happy Land Social Club, trapping 87 people inside. It was,
at the time, the worst mass murder in American history.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, after a memorial service at St. Thomas Aquinas Church
attended by about 500 people, dozens of mourners quietly strolled
two blocks to a 12-foot-high monument on a traffic island in front
of the building where their relatives died.
</P>
<P>
   Etched on the monument's sides are the names of the victims,
most of them Honduran immigrants, who died in the early morning of
March 25, 1990, when Julio Gonzalez torched the illegal nightclub,
which had been ordered closed for fire code and other violations.
Gonzalez, who was angry with his girlfriend, an employee at the
club, was later sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``This day is so sad, so sad that I just want to cry,'' said
Maria Ethel Arriola, who lost three brothers, a daughter, two
cousins and close friends in the blaze. ``But I had to be here
because I love them so much, because they are always with us,
always with me.''
</P>
<P>
   The crime's depravity stunned a city and a nation. But it cut
most deeply in what was then New York's budding community of
several thousand Honduran immigrants, who had been virtually
unknown to other New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, the crime continues to haunt not only the
close-knit Honduran community, many of whom still live in the
Bronx, but also a smattering of villages in Honduras that were home
to many of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still remember this, especially in the north of the
country where many of the families are from,'' Octavio Pineda, the
consul general of Honduras in New York, said yesterday as he left
the church service. ``It was a shock for the community. In the
Bronx, everyone was affected,'' he said, referring to the borough's
Honduran community. ``People lost a close relative or a friend or a
co-worker. Somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   The throng of mourners Sunday carried dozens of stories of
heartache and loss. Marvin Doubleday Jr., 9, never met his father,
Marvin Doubleday Sr., a gas station worker, who was 22 when he
died. Standing next to his mother, Dilcia Pineda, the boy said he
often comes to the memorial ``to feel my father close to me.'' And
he added, ``I always bring flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Clark, 22, was only 12 when her brother, Norman, and
five of her cousins died. ``I lost so much,'' she said, tears
streaming down her face as she stood before the monument, the names
of her relatives lined up one after another. ``I still remember it
all. Even though he was my brother, he was like my best friend,
like my confidante. I loved him so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Ferrera, 50, lost her son, Israel Antonio Bulnes, who was
19 when he went to Happy Land to dance the night away. ``My son was
very special with me. He cared for me. If you wanted anything, he'd
do it,'' said Ferrera, who cleans homes and lives with her daughter
in the Bronx. ``I still feel like it happened yesterday. I still
feel it. Things don't change.''
</P>
<P>
   Candida Maximo, 66, vividly recalls going to Public School 67,
near the social club, after the fire and learning that the body of
her son, Ines Maximo, 23, was among those pulled from the charred
structure. ``He's always missed,'' she said. ``And I wonder what it
would be like to have a grandson of his.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tears, those who lost relatives said the memorial
provided, in some ways, a time to celebrate the lives of their
loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   The service at St. Thomas Aquinas had festive flourishes. The
nine-member chorus, with its trumpets and guitars, sang joyful
songs in Spanish, music similar to Mexican mariachis and rancheras.
And the Rev. Francisco Garmendia, whose tenure at St. Thomas
Aquinas predates the fire, recalled rushing to the social club and
later notifying survivors. He exhorted those who marched to the
monument to ``give a great applause for all those angels who are
here with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Pineda, who was to marry Marvin Doubleday, said that though
facing the anniversary was hard, she felt fortunate to be able to
share such an important day with her children and Doubleday's
mother, who traveled to New York from Honduras to attend the
memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been sad long enough. We've mourned. It's good to have
things be festive,'' Pineda said. ``It's a joy to be able to come
here and remember here. It's showing respect to them.''
</P>
<P>
   At the monument, which stands in a small island between Southern
Boulevard and Crotona Parkway, the families listened attentively as
community leaders and Father Garmendia spoke about the gains
Hondurans and others in the neighborhood had made in the last 10
years. Then, they shared a simple lunch of sandwiches and sodas
that had been put out on folding tables in front of the nondescript
building where Happy Land was located.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrera said that being with a crowd made the day much easier.
She said that when she usually passes the monument, she can not
help but see her son and feel a deep sense of grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``This helps you. You're not alone,'' she said, standing near
the etched name of her son and 86 others. ``You know you have
support. It helps to know that after 10 years, people have not
forgotten.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Acting president Vladimir Putin held a narrow majority
of the vote early Sunday in Russia's presidential election, poised
for the outright victory that the Kremlin had pursued with growing
desperation to avoid a runoff next month.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putin's anticlimactic triumph was huge in absolute
terms _ some 20 percentage points ahead of his closest rival, the
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov _ it also appeared likely to fall
considerably short of expectations. And that further elevated
doubts, which had begun to surface in the campaign's final days,
about the depth of Putin's popular support.
</P>
<P>
   With 84 percent of the ballots counted by early Monday morning,
Putin had captured 51.9 percent of the vote, compared with 29.97
percent for Zyuganov. The head of the liberal Yabloko party, the
legislator Grigory Yavlinsky, was in a remote third place with 5.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Russian television stations proclaimed Putin the victor, saying
that a runoff would be unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   The final pre-election polls, released a week before Sunday's
election, indicated that Putin was backed by as many as 57 per cent
of respondents who said they intended to vote.
</P>
<P>
   In a postmidnight news conference, Putin seemed to give a nod to
the narrowness of his majority, noting that with a potential
electorate of 108 million, ``even a half percentage point is a huge
credit from the population.''
</P>
<P>
   More telling, he seemed to suggest that he might invite
political rivals into government in an apparent effort to build
political support for whatever programs he proposes.
</P>
<P>
   Putin was especially solicitous of Zyuganov, whose support
appeared almost one-fifth greater than pollsters had estimated.
</P>
<P>
   In his news conference, Putin stated with surprising bluntness
that Zyuganov's showing, especially in the face of a relentlessly
hostile government and private press, was a warning that the
Kremlin was not adequately addressing the problems of the working
class and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   He also offered tributes to his bitter rivals, the former prime
minister Yevgeny Primakov and Moscow's mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, saying
that they had helped hold Russia together by supporting the war
against separatist rebels in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they or any other outsiders will be brought to the
Kremlin ``is subject matter for negotiations,'' Putin said. But he
added, in an allusion to a classic Russian fairy tale, that he
would not allow his team to resemble ``the notorious troika, where
one is pulling into the water, another one backwards and the third
one to the clouds.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's intentions may well depend on whether the bare majority
to which he clung in Moscow's predawn survives the counting of the
final ballots. If it does, Putin can accurately claim a mandate
from Russian voters, paper-thin though it might be, to carry out
new policies.
</P>
<P>
   If it does not, the law requires that he face the second-place
finisher, Zyuganov, in a runoff scheduled for April 16.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually no one doubts that Putin would win such a contest
handily; Zyuganov, also the Communist candidate in the 1996
presidential election, could muster only 40 per cent of the vote in
a runoff that year against Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also clear that Putin would emerge from that runoff a
diminished leader, stripped of the image of infallibility and
inevitability that has cloaked him almost since Yeltsin named him
prime minister last August.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, the spare, dour 47-year-old former chief of domestic
intelligence, has captivated the public and utterly confounded
political sages since his vault from near-total obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   No one expected a man unschooled in politics and so bland in
personality and appearance to seize the Russians' imagination. Most
predicted that Putin's first and only action of profound importance
_ the launching of an all-out war on secessionist rebels in the
province of Chechnya _ would be an act of political suicide.
Yeltsin's decision in 1994 to conduct a Chechen war that went
disastrously awry for the Russian army almost cost him the 1996
election and was one cause of his impeachment in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But in both cases Putin confounded the political pundits. His
calm decisiveness, apolitical manner and comparative youth
contrasted favorably with the bombast, Kremlin maneuvering and
indecision of the final years of an increasingly infirm Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   And the second Chechen war turned out to galvanize ordinary
citizens, stung by the loss of Soviet empire and industrial might,
who were looking for some evidence of Russian heft to boost their
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   At times this winter, polls indicated that close to three in
four Russians supported Putin's conduct as prime minister and _
after Yeltsin abruptly quit on New Year's Eve _ as acting
president. His support was so robust that Primakov, once seen as a
formidable opponent for the presidency, quit the race.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last month, some of that support began to fade. The
reason is not completely clear: It may be in part that Putin has
drifted out of the honeymoon phase that is granted new leaders, and
in part that voters began to focus on the election and discovered
other candidates they liked.

</P>
<P>
   ``The decline is among those people who like Putin but do not
vote for him,'' said Leonid Sedov, who directs the Public Opinion
Foundation, a major Moscow polling organization. ``They have
nothing against him; they think his policies are quite all right.
But they were going to vote for other persons anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last week of the campaign, during which it was forbidden
to publish opinion polls, Putin's backers launched a furious effort
to recapture some of that support, in part by launching negative
attacks on those politicians who were perceived as siphoning it
away.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the focus was on Yavlinsky. In the final days
of the race, as Putin garnered much media attention by flying a
combat fighter to Chechnya on an ostensibly official visit,
Yavlinsky was investigated by the government on suspicion of
illegally campaigning on a military base.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the state television network ORT, controlled in part
by the financier Boris Berezovsky, who is close to the Kremlin,
broadcast a series of news reports identifying Jews, homosexuals
and foreigners as principal supporters of Yavlinsky.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, Putin's chief campaign strategist denied any
role in those reports, which were clearly designed to stir
smoldering Russian biases against minorities to Yavlinsky's
disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many mysterious and silly things happen during the campaign,''
the strategist, Gleb Pavlovsky, said in an interview on the
privately owned NTV network. ``I know nothing about Yavlinsky's
sexual orientation, and I know nothing about events that take place
in the gay community. If it was staged, it did Putin nothing but
harm.''
</P>
<P>
   Yavlinsky, long regarded as a leader of Russia's Western-style
democrats, said Sunday night that his campaign ``achieved what we
wanted _ we have demonstrated that there are millions of people
behind us who support what we are talking about.'' He indicated
that he hopes to form a broader coalition of right-wing critics of
the Putin government.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear what that coalition might be. Many of
Yavlinsky's ideological allies, such as the Yeltsin government
veterans who comprise the new Union of Right Forces, have cast
their lot with Putin.
</P>
<P>
   In geographic terms, Putin swept every region of the nation. But
he apparently avoided a runoff by piling up votes in European
Russia to offset a comparatively disappointing showing in Siberia
and on the Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
   In vast parts of the less populous east _in the enormous central
Siberian province of Krasnoyarsk, and far eastern regions like
Chukotka and Primoriye _ Putin failed to reach the 50 percent mark.
He also fell well short in the city of Moscow, which gave him only
46.3 percent of the vote and Yavlinsky 18.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But in his hometown of St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest
city, Putin collected more than six of every 10 votes. And in
northwestern provinces like Kaliningrad and Karelia, he did almost
as well.
</P>
<P>
   The election commission stated that some 67 percent of voters
had cast ballots, slightly below the turnout in the nation's first
post-Soviet presidential election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That alleviated one of the Kremlin's secondary concerns: that
unanimous predictions of Putin's victory would depress turnout
below the legally binding level of 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If turnout fell below that floor, a new election would have been
required in four months. Since it did not, Putin will almost
certainly be sworn in, in May, for a full four-year term as
president.

(ATTN: N.J.)  
 MARCH FOR GUN CONTROL STARTS WITH ONE WORRIED MOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHORT HILLS, N.J. _ The movement of mothers for stricter handgun
laws _ a force that organizers predict will bring tens of thousands
to a Mother's Day march on Washington in May _ began with one
woman, Donna Dees-Thomases, and an image she could not get out of
her mind.
</P>
<P>
   Dees-Thomases, 42, a part-time publicist and a mother of two
daughters and three stepsons, acknowledges that she has not been
one to get involved in political issues. But on the night of Aug.
10, when she saw television news footage of children being led to
safety after a gunman's shooting rampage at a Jewish community
center in Granada Hills, Calif., she was deeply shaken. The
children's day camp, she said, looked much like the one her girls
attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too much to bear,'' she said at her home in this
wealthy suburban community last week. ``This is what life has
become in America. You can't send your kids to nursery school
anymore and expect them to be safe.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Dees-Thomases turned her emotions into action.
She scribbled a strategy on the back of an envelope: a plan to send
thousands of mothers to Washington to pressure legislators into
enacting tougher gun legislation. A week later, she applied to the
National Park Service to hold the Million Mom March on May 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't just be sitting around our kitchens, crying about gun
violence,'' she said. ``We have to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Dees-Thomases planned to hand over her idea to
well-connected friends in Washington. ``I'm not organized,'' she
said. ``I wrote the plan, and it was a good plan, but I wanted
others to execute it.''
</P>
<P>
   But her Washington friends all politely told her that although
it was a good idea, they doubted that it had much chance of getting
Congress' attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it's good that they turned me down,'' she said.
``The march shouldn't be originating from Washington. It should
come from moms in New Jersey, moms in Tulsa, Okla., moms in
Portland, Ore. And that's what it became.''
</P>
<P>
   Dees-Thomases instead called a few friends in the area, some of
them homemakers, some with special job skills like hers that would
be helpful in organizing the march. All of them said they were fed
up about gun violence. By Labor Day she had a group of 100 women
who had agreed to help spread the word; some of them had been
personally touched by gun violence, and some of them were just
angry about it. They were all volunteers at first, giving of their
time, labor and money to help with a phone line and other
activities.
</P>
<P>
   At first, two grandmothers transcribed all the messages left at
the group's telephone number, but there were few calls at the
beginning. ``I used to return every call we got,'' Dees-Thomases
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the group kept putting out the word, and mothers across the
nation kept hearing about them, sharing their tales of gun use gone
awry, and little by little the news of the march spread. The group
also began to attract corporate sponsors and recently could afford
to hire a small staff in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Dees-Thomases knows a little bit about working the media: She
was an assistant press secretary for Russell B. Long, the former
senator from Louisiana; she worked for ``The CBS Evening News With
Dan Rather''; and she is the sister-in-law of Susan Thomases, a
close friend of first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The group announced its march on ``CBS This Morning.'' Members
were asked to be on television talk shows, and slowly, newspaper
reporters came calling. Rosie O'Donnell announced last week that
she would be the master of ceremonies for the march, and Mrs.
Clinton has said she will attend.
</P>
<P>
   The group has created a Web site (www.millionmommarch.com) that
is chatty and features an Apple Pie Award to those who have called
for tougher gun control laws, and a Time Out Chair for opponents of
such laws. The only one in the Time Out Chair so far is Rep. Tom
Delay, R-Texas, who once said, ``This House is a pro-gun house.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an elected official,'' Dees-Thomases said. ``He's
supposed to be out there looking out for the health and welfare of
people. Guns are a public health issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shame on him! He's just going to stay in that Time Out
Chair,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Delay said that the congressman was not
concerned about the group's uncomplimentary recognition of him, and
that it had not made him change his views. Delay is a
``conservative whose views reflect core Republican values,'' said
Jonathan Baron, communications director for Delay. ``One of those
values is the Second Amendment and the right to bear arms.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association heard about the group, and the
association's executive vice president, Wayne R. LaPierre, has
criticized its tactics. A group calling itself the Second Amendment
Sisters has announced that it will have a counterdemonstration on
Mother's Day. (Originally it was called Moms 4 Guns.)
</P>
<P>
   The attention probably helped the Million Mom March. One day in
February, its site got 15,000 hits. Two days later, after some
television appearances, there were 76,000 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Dees-Thomases emphasizes that the group does not want guns
banned. The group is not talking about rifles used in hunting, for
example. Instead, she said, it is focusing on handguns and seeking
what it calls sensible gun control. The group wants all handguns to
have childproof locks and to be registered, and all handgun owners
to be licensed.
</P>
<P>
   Dees-Thomases concedes that the group is dominated by white
suburban women, but said the members were trying to reach out to
others, including inner-city mothers. So far there are plans to
organize rallies on the same day in about 20 other cities,
including one in East Los Angeles, which is expected to be attended
largely by Hispanic women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not let one child be forgotten,'' Dees-Thomases
said. She said that she ignored the issue of gun violence until
recent shootings in which the victims ``looked like my children.''
</P>
<P>
   Dees-Thomases said it was too early to tell how many people
would show up for the march, but she is counting on at least
10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to roll up our sleeves and get as many moms out there
as possible,'' she said. ``And dads.''

EDWARD KNIPLING, 90, THE MAN WHO STERILIZED THE SCREWWORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ERIC NAGOURNEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward F. Knipling, whose revolutionary approach to agricultural
pest control sent the once fearsome screwworm the way of the
cowboy, died on March 17 at his home in Arlington, Va. He was three
days shy of his 91st birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Knipling, for many years the top entomologist at the federal
Department of Agriculture, came up with the idea that the insect
populations that ravage crops and livestock could be controlled by
sterilizing the pests and then unleashing them in torrential
numbers. His success in controlling insects without insecticides
brought him awards from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Knipling's first target was the screwworm, a striped, grayish
insect twice the size of a housefly that was once the scourge of
farmers across the Southern United States and in Central America,
costing tens of millions of dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   The late (at least in the United States), unlamented insect
sought out any wound it could find on warm-blooded animals _
chiefly livestock, but sometimes people _ and then laid hundreds of
eggs. When the eggs hatched, the maggots ate the flesh with such
voraciousness that full-grown cattle could die within 10 days. By
then, the parasites, disdaining the dead, had usually moved on,
developing into flies and seeking the next victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't at all unusual to come to a watering place for
animals and find 20 dead cows _ all killed by screwworms,''
recalled James R. Coppedge, a colleague of Knipling's at the
Agricultural Research Service who helped him battle the insects in
Texas in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Raymond C. Bushland, another Agriculture Department
colleague, Knipling devised a tactic unlike any seen before in the
fight against agricultural pests. The men decided to breed sterile
male screwworm flies and release them in the hope that they would
mate frequently but produce no offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Knipling got the idea after noticing that while female
screwworms mated only once, males did so repeatedly. Sterilizing
the males, he reasoned, would have a far greater and longer-lasting
effect than the pesticides then in use.
</P>
<P>
   Within a dozen years, the screwworm was virtually banished. For
American farmers, what was once a plague is now little more than a
memory. (In Texas, Coppedge said, many cowboys who used to make
their living desperately trying to round up and treat infected
cattle faded away with their former nemesis.) Work is being done to
eradicate the pest elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The sterilization technique has been used with success against
other pests, including the Mediterranean fruit fly and the tsetse
fly in Africa, which carries sleeping sickness.
</P>
<P>
   Before he could do battle with the screwworm, Knipling had
another fight on his hands: convincing his peers and supervisors
that the sterilization approach had merit.
</P>
<P>
   Knipling, the son of a South Texas cotton farmer who grew up
seeing the damage wrought by insects, conceived the idea in 1938,
years before he was able to put it to the test, as a young field
worker for the Agriculture Department. ``Forget this crazy idea and
concentrate on more important things,'' he recalled one supervisor
telling him, according to a 1975 issue of Current Biography.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, running what amounted to an off-the-books
operation, Knipling and Bushland, who died in 1995, secured an old
Army X-ray machine and tried to see if the screwworm fly could be
sterilized. In 1953, they released the first batch of sterilized
flies on Sanibel Island in Florida. While the experiment appeared
successful, flies from the mainland soon reappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, a better testing ground came up when the Dutch
government appealed to the United States for help with a screwworm
plague in Curacao. The Agriculture Department released 150,000
sterilized flies a week on the island, and within three months the
pest was eradicated. Full-scale eradication programs were then put
in place in Florida and the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Fred Knipling was born on March 20, 1909, near Port
Lavaca. As a farm boy, he developed an early interest in the
behavior of animals and insects.
</P>
<P>
   His wife of 66 years, Phoebe Hall Knipling, died in 1998. He is
survived by three sons: Edward, of Clarksville, Md., Gary, of Mason
Neck, Va., and Ronald, of Arlington; and two daughters: Edwina
Knipling Lake of Alexandria, Va., and Anita Knipling Scott of
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and relatives said the man many people called ``Knip''
never lost his love of wildlife. Coppedge recalled that in the
thick of the fight against the screwworm, Knipling liked to talk
about hunting and fishing, but always returned to his true passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he really loved to do,'' Coppedge said, ``was he loved to
sit down and talk insects.''

JEREMY INGALLS, 88, ERUDITE POET WITH A FONDNESS FOR ALLUSIONS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeremy Ingalls, an acclaimed poet during the 1940s and '50s,
died on March 16 in Tucson, where she lived. She was 88.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941 Ingalls won the Yale Series of Younger Poets prize for
``The Metaphysical Sword,'' a collection that used classical,
mythological, biblical and Oriental allusions. These influences
weighed heavily in her most ambitious work, the epic ``Tahl''
(1945). The poem tells the story of a contemporary young musician
who transcends time. ``Tahl'' earned mixed reviews from critics who
hailed it for its use of anthropological, historical, religious,
literary and musical lore or criticized its writer for showing off
her erudition.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Tahl,'' she wrote:
</P>
<P>
   The spice conjoint of human ironies
</P>
<P>
   Palled on him more insipid than my game
</P>
<P>
   Of cards, my maundering on fate. He stood
</P>
<P>
   Groping Trophonian caves for Gygian rings
</P>
<P>
   Visions and apologues, ladders to beautiful good,
</P>
<P>
   And farmer's common saws could only prick him.
</P>
<P>
   Mildred Dodge Jeremy Ingalls grew up in Gloucester, Mass. At 12
she was reading Dante and by 14 she took in Balzac, Goethe,
Confucius, Sun Yat-sen and Nietzsche. She earned her bachelor's and
master's degrees from Tufts College and studied Chinese at the
University of Chicago Oriental Institute. In 1948 she joined the
faculty at Rockford College in Illinois, where she taught Chinese
history, English literature and creative writing before retiring in
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Ingalls' first published work, ``A Book of Legends'' (1941), was
prose. It was followed in 1953 by ``The Galilean Way,'' a study of
comparative religions. Her poetry collections included ``The Woman
From the Island'' (1958), ``These Islands Also'' (1959) and ``This
Stubborn Quantum'' (1983). In 1989 she published ``The Epic
Tradition and Related Essays.''
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a foster son, Yong-ho Ch'oe of Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years several of Ingalls' poems were published in an
anthology from the Yale University Press and she was honored by the
University of Chicago as ``a poet of the ages.''

AL GREY, 74, A SLY TROMBONIST WHO PLAYED WITH COUNT BASIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trombonist Al Grey, a member of the Count Basie band through
various stretches from 1957 to 1977 and a strong, humorous
improviser, died March 24 at a hospital in Scottsdale, Ariz. He was
74 and lived in Great Neck, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from diabetes, said his companion,
Rosalie Soladar.
</P>
<P>
   Grey exemplified the musicians that Basie sought and cultivated:
a disciplined section player who could also step forward for solos
and transcend that role with style. His signature was the plunger
mute, and he used it swaggeringly, making his malingering,
behind-the-beat notes plump and juicy. He knew how to insinuate
slyness into standards and ballads, but he was probably at his best
on the blues; he needed a tenacious rhythm section as a bed for his
authoritative dance-band riffs.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the band at the beginning of Basie's tenure with
Roulette records and played with it through the 60s _ the last
great decade of Basie music _ except for a stint as to lead a small
group with the saxophonist Billy Mitchell. Along with the tenor
saxophonist Eddie (Lockjaw) Davis, Grey was a principal soloist for
the band in the late 60s; some of his best work can be heard on the
1966 album ``Sinatra at the Sands,'' with the Basie band
accompanying Frank Sinatra, as well as the recording of a
performance of the band from the same Las Vegas engagement, ``Count
Basie Live at the Sands (Before Frank).''
</P>
<P>
   Grey was born in Aldie, Va., and learned to play trombone from
his father, an instructor for a youth orchestra in Pottstown, Pa.
He worked in a Navy band during World War II, and musicians he
encountered there recommended him to Benny Carter, whose band he
joined in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   After the Basie years Grey was a busy freelancer. He led a band
with the saxophonist Jimmy Forrest, and of another with his son,
Mike, also a trombonist. He toured a little with Norman Granz's
Jazz at the Philharmonic and played with George Wein's Newport
All-Stars.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son Mike, of Las Vegas, he is survived his
sons Albert Jr., Ernest and Robert, of Philadelphia; a brother,
Richard, of Reading, Pa.; a sister, Jenny Beck of Philadelphia; and
four grandchildren.

SIG MICKELSON, FIRST DIRECTOR OF CBS TV NEWS, DIES AT 86
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Ill., Calif., La.)  (rk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sig Mickelson, who as the first director of CBS television news
attended at the birth of what became one of the nation's most
powerful news organizations before moving into a second career in
government and academia, died Friday evening in San Diego. He was
86.
</P>
<P>
   In his years with CBS, from 1949 to 1961, he helped merge the
fledgling television news operation with the more senior and
better-known corps of radio news correspondents who, under Edward
R. Murrow, had come to international prominence in Europe during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson had been a local television news director at WCCO in
Minneapolis during World War II. He earned his early reputation at
the network news division during the 1952 political conventions.
Having started out in mid-1951 with a staff of 14, he successfully
introduced the concept of gavel-to-gavel television convention
coverage a year later. He promoted a local Washington newscaster,
Walter Cronkite, to anchor of the network's convention coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody blazed a trail for us in advance; so everything we did
was first time out,'' Mickelson told Brian Lamb of C-SPAN in a 1990
broadcast about Mickelson's book ``From Whistle Stop to Sound
Bite.''
</P>
<P>
   On that broadcast, Mickelson said, ``It just so happened that
politics in 1952 was more exciting than it had been for many years
because there were no holdover candidates, so the two major parties
_ I'm talking presidential race only _ so everything had to start
from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the coinage of ``anchorman'' has been variously
attributed to three CBS news executives who were at those
conventions _ Mickelson, Don Hewitt, now the executive producer of
``60 Minutes,'' and the convention producer Paul Levitan _ there is
no disagreement that Mickelson set Cronkite on the path to become
the country's best-known anchor.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1952 conventions, television news was still a junior
partner to the radio news division. As Hewitt explained, citing the
names of famous early CBS correspondents: ``In the beginning, the
Murrows, Collingswoods, Sevareids wouldn't deign to be caught in
television. Television was for Howdy Doody and `Romper Room.' Radio
was for adults.'' But, Hewitt said, ``Under Sig, the radio
correspondents began to realize, slowly but surely, that the future
of broadcast news lay in television.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, Mickelson was appointed a network vice president,
elevating the news and public affairs division to senior status
within Columbia Broadcasting System. In the corporate hierarchy, he
was Murrow's boss. Yet according to Stanley Cloud, co-author with
Lynne Olson of ``The Murrow Boys,'' Mickelson was sometimes defied
by his more famous colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But the medium he ran was the medium of the future, and CBS'
radio correspondents adapted, if reluctantly. In November 1951,
Murrow's radio program, ``Hear It Now,'' began its television run
as ``See It Now.'' But as late as 1954, Cloud said, Mickelson's
efforts to have correspondents use TV cameras were rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson and Murrow ``were not each other's cup of tea,'' said
Daniel Schorr, a CBS television correspondent for two decades and
now a senior political analyst with National Public Radio.
Mickelson also crossed swords with Fred Friendly, Murrow's
collaborator as the producer of ``See It Now.'' As Schorr described
it: ``Mickelson wanted to deal with problems in the most pragmatic
way. They were always scrapping because Friendly never saw a budget
he didn't want to violate, and Mickelson was in overall charge of
the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson's role in the network _ he was made president of the
CBS news division in 1959 _ gave him a front-row seat on the
network's internal dramas, including the agreement of its founder,
William Paley, to let the CIA director, Allen Dulles, informally
debrief its correspondents. ``I didn't raise an eyebrow about
cooperating back then,'' Mickelson said in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Salant, who succeeded Mickelson as CBS News president in
1961, said in a 1977 interview in The New York Times that he cut
the ties between the network's news division and the intelligence
agency. Later Friendly would succeed Salant in the job.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, Mickelson began a nine-year stint as director of
Time-Life Broadcasting. He was on the faculty at Northwestern
University's Medill School of Journalism from 1972 to 1975 and
headed Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty from 1975 through 1978.
</P>
<P>
   A founder of the Radio and Television News Directors
Association, Mickelson also taught on the communications faculties
at San Diego State University and Louisiana State University. CBS
is helping to endow the Sig Mickelson/CBS Professorship at LSU's
Manship School _ where Mickelson had taught after college and where
he met his first wife, Maybelle Brown, who died in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson is survived by his second wife, Elena; two children
from his first marriage, Ann Mickelson de Brauw, of Evanston, Ill.,
and Dr. Alan Mickelson of Boulder, Colo.; two stepchildren, Alberto
Mier y Teran of San Diego and Ina Mier y Teran Sheppard, of South
Orange, N.J.; and seven grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1990 C-SPAN discussion of ``From Whistle Stop to Sound
Bite,'' he recalled his early hope that televised coverage of
politics would create a livelier, more informed democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It simply hasn't happened,'' he said. ``We were hoping that
we'd get more voters to the polls. We were hoping we'd have better
candidates, better-informed candidates; that the charlatans were
out of business completely; that the X-ray eye would expose all the
charlatanism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, we haven't more people going to the polls,'' he
added. ``And surely there is no exposure of the charlatans anymore.
The X-ray eye probably has astigmatism of some kind or other.''

 &HT;    Dressed to thrill in Oscar-worthy hues

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Oscar fashion took a colorful turn for the better
Sunday night. Many of Hollywood's leading ladies helped enliven the
ceremonies by dressing in a ravishing array of shades.
</P>
<P>
   Down in front! We wonder who had the misfortune of sitting
behind R&AMP;B priestess Erykah Badu. Her green, raffia-wrapped
headpiece was taller than Haley Joel Osment. At least Badu had the
presence of mind to change out of this green leather monstrosity
she designed herself. As an award presenter later she wore a simple
green chiffon gown.
</P>
<P>
   Grape juice: Ashley Judd's purple gown was designed for her by
Valentino; she completed the look to stunning perfection with a
shawl, a hair ornament and eyeshadow to match.
</P>
<P>
   The gold standard: Nicole Kidman's off-the-shoulder gown with
its ruffled hem and neckline gave her a statuesque appearance. And
hubby Tom Cruise gave a nod to old-style movie glamour in his
vintage-look tuxedo and antique white shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, good-lookin': Lucy Liu wore a one-shouldered gown worth
saluting. It sparkled (and clung) in all the right places, yet it
had a demure quality to it that was rare on this night of cleavage
mania.

1,500 MARCH IN BOSTON TO PROTEST BIOTECH FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to change Monday to Sunday in 4th graf.)  
(mk) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   BOSTON _ In what organizers called the largest American
demonstration against genetically engineered food, more than 1,500
protesters marched through downtown Boston Sunday and ended up
outside a major biotechnology industry convention, where they
pointed their fingers at the suited scientists watching from the
windows and shouted, ``Shame on you!''
</P>
<P>
   City officials and police officers, concerned about a possible
repeat of the fracas at the protests against the World Trade
Organization in Seattle last fall, had prepared assiduously for the
demonstration. But all passed peacefully in an atmosphere something
like an Earth Day festival.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the demonstration was not wild but wildly creative.
Street theater abounded; several protesters ran around dressed as
white-coated fanatical scientists wielding giant syringes and
several others fluttered about as butterflies to symbolize the
monarchs that a study has shown were harmed by genetically altered
corn. A man in a Frankenstein costume pushed a shopping cart
bearing genetically engineered ``Frankenflakes,'' and another wore
a papier-mache killer tomato on his head.
</P>
<P>
   The protest was timed to coincide with Bio2000, a record-setter
for the other side: Its organizers call it the largest
biotechnology conference in the United States, gathering about
7,000 participants for five days, beginning Sunday, to share the
latest news on promising drugs and techniques. Its speakers include
the actor Christopher Reeve and Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In a pre-emptive salvo against the protesters, about 2,000
scientists from around the world, including two Nobel laureates,
signed a ``Declaration in Support of Agricultural Biotechnology,''
said AgBioWorld.com, an advocacy group that released the
declaration on Thursday. It quoted the declaration's organizer, Dr.
C.S. Prakash of Tuskegee University, as saying that ``biotech crops
allow farmers to grow more food on less land with less synthetic
pesticides and herbicides.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few conference participants to venture outside the
convention center to watch the march, Bob Renger, the dean of
sciences of Ventura College in California, said he thought it was
good that ``people are expressing their views and they're doing it
in a peaceful way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think more people will hear them as a consequence,'' Renger
said. But, he said: ``I happen to disagree with what they're
saying. I'm an archaeologist and I know we've been changing the
environment for 10,000 years. The only difference is that we've
speeded up the process that we're changing things.''
</P>
<P>
   He could support the idea of labeling genetically engineered
food, he said, but if people took ``an extreme view,'' it might
stop the benefits coming from improved crops and pharmaceutical
products. ``I'm concerned over unreasonable reaction,'' he said.
``It's not the technology here, it's what people do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   No genetically altered food has been shown to have harmed
people, but opponents say that not enough research has been done to
prove that it is safe. Protesters argued Sunday that the
agricultural biotechnology industry, fueled by greed, was placing
human health _ possibly the health of the biosphere _ at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the people who gave us thalidomide babies,'' Sarah
Seeds, a protester who also trains others to protest nonviolently,
said of the participants in the Bio2000 convention. ``Now they want
to give us genetically modified food.'' Thalidomide, a drug
prescribed for morning sickness, caused deformities in infants in
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the public sentiment against genetically engineered
food reached a ground swell so great that the cultivation and sale
of such food there has all but stopped.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans have remained much more receptive to genetically
engineered crops, which have been altered by techniques that take
some genetic material from another plant or animal and insert it to
produce useful traits like greater resistance to insects. Nearly
two-thirds of the products on American supermarket shelves are
estimated to contain genetically altered crops.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's protest, however, may indicate some swelling in the
opposition. Last December in Oakland, Calif., only a few hundred
people protested a public meeting about bio-engineered food held by
the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the crops.
Sunday, the crowd nearly filled Boston's Copley Square before the
march, and the slogans and arguments seemed to get through to
onlookers like Sathya Rajavelu, a technology manager for a
financial services company who had wandered down to the protest.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Rajavelu said, he thought the conference
participants probably saw the protest as nothing but entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, ``This is a cause that a lot of
people could easily relate to, so they will most likely get on the
bandwagon.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, ``I'm sure there would be at least one person up
there'' _ he gestured at the convention center _ ``who will step
back and say, `Have we been totally carried away with what we
do?'''

   (NYT13) NEW YORK -- March 26, 2000 -- ARREST-THEATER-REVIEW --
Anna Deveare Smith's theater pieces have often been compared to
Studs Terkel's books, and the melding of the writer and the
performance artist here seems a fitting act of homage, as can be
seen in ``House Arrest'', which opened Sunday night at the Joseph
Papp Public Theater in Manhattan. That all the presidency is a
stage isn't really a new idea, but it certainly has promise as the
basis for an evening of theater. Anna Deveare Smith in evokes
prominent Americans and especially presidents, warts and all, from
Jefferson to Lincoln to Bill Clinton. (Sara Krulwich/The New York

RUSSIA-VOICES -- Two Russians who declined to give their last
names, Sergei, right, and Vladimir, left, talked politics after
voting in Sergiyev Posad, 40 miles north of Moscow, Sunday. Voters
summed up the reasons why Russian president Vladimir V. Putin was
elected Russia's next leader. ``Why do I support Putin?'' says
Vladimir, a defense worker. ``Because he is the person who, at this
given moment, has real power. Putin is our acting president, and,
in the three months since our former president resigned, he has had
control over all the leadership, all the military forces, all the
economists,'' says Vladimir. ``And look. He has already met with
Madeleine Albright, and with that, whats-his-name, Blair.'' (James

screens that can carry text and images are being introduced as a

those in the audience who are able to hear the soundtrack. The
technology has been developed by the National Center for Accessible

subtitles are displayed, in mirror reverse, on a 7-foot-wide,
16-inch-tall light-emitting-diode screen at the rear of the
theater. People watch the film through a small smoked plexiglass
panel, which reflects the subtitles behind them while allowing them
to also see the movie screen at the front of the theater. (George

Israel's holy land. On Sunday the pope visited the Western Wall,
and as is the custom of Jewish visitors, tucked a heartfelt note to
God into a crevice in the wall. The pope's note bore the message of
reconciliation that has been the public theme of his six-day
personal pilgrimage, which concluded peacefully Sunday as he moved
from the Al-Aqsa Mosque to the wall and then to the Church of the
Holy Sepulcher. (Rina Castelnuovo/The New York Times)

   (NYT13) NEW YORK -- March 26, 2000 -- ARREST-THEATER-REVIEW --
Anna Deveare Smith's theater pieces have often been compared to
Studs Terkel's books, and the melding of the writer and the
performance artist here seems a fitting act of homage, as can be
seen in ``House Arrest'', which opened Sunday night at the Joseph
Papp Public Theater in Manhattan. That all the presidency is a
stage isn't really a new idea, but it certainly has promise as the
basis for an evening of theater. Anna Deveare Smith in evokes
prominent Americans and especially presidents, warts and all, from
Jefferson to Lincoln to Bill Clinton. (Sara Krulwich/The New York

RUSSIA-VOICES -- Two Russians who declined to give their last
names, Sergei, right, and Vladimir, left, talked politics after
voting in Sergiyev Posad, 40 miles north of Moscow, Sunday. Voters
summed up the reasons why Russian president Vladimir V. Putin was
elected Russia's next leader. ``Why do I support Putin?'' says
Vladimir, a defense worker. ``Because he is the person who, at this
given moment, has real power. Putin is our acting president, and,
in the three months since our former president resigned, he has had
control over all the leadership, all the military forces, all the
economists,'' says Vladimir. ``And look. He has already met with
Madeleine Albright, and with that, whats-his-name, Blair.'' (James

Vladimir Putin's anticlimactic triumph was huge in absolute terms,

This season has been further marked by the appearance of a new and
rich presence that has aggressively invaded Sotheby's and
Christie's turf: Phillips, a 206-year-old auction house. Some
wonder if Phillips will be able to survive, like the other two
houses have, after the current economic boom subsides.

screens that can carry text and images are being introduced as a

subtitles are displayed, in mirror reverse, on a 7-foot-wide,
16-inch-tall light-emitting-diode screen at the rear of the
theater. People watch the film through a small smoked plexiglass
panel, which reflects the subtitles behind them while allowing them
to also see the movie screen at the front of the theater. (George

Israel's holy land. On Sunday the pope visited the Western Wall,
and as is the custom of Jewish visitors, tucked a heartfelt note to
God into a crevice in the wall. The pope's note bore the message of

personal pilgrimage, which concluded peacefully Sunday as he moved
from the Al-Aqsa Mosque to the wall and then to the Church of the

EDITORIAL: COMING BATTLES FOR REFORM
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, March 26:
</P>
<P>
   Even after Sen. John McCain's defeat in the presidential race,
the rush to embrace his themes of reform is gaining force. Vice
President Al Gore is to announce Monday that his top domestic
legislative priority should he win the election will be overhauling
the campaign finance laws. He plans to press for prompt passage of
the tough McCain-Feingold reform bill and down the road has some
imaginative ideas for moving toward public financing of
congressional campaigns and free broadcast time for candidates.
That should pose a salutary challenge to Gov. George W. Bush, who
tirelessly proclaims himself the ``reformer with results'' but has
a campaign reform proposal that is a toothless sham.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has emerged from his own campaign finance
embarrassments with the zeal of a convert, said he intends to
commit himself so heavily to a ban on soft money as embodied in
McCain-Feingold that even the most suspicious voter will recognize
he would have no choice but to carry through. Beyond
McCain-Feingold, he said he would push for public financing through
tax-deductible contributions to a special endowment and, if that
proved insufficient, would have broadcasters provide free air time
as a condition for keeping their licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Those bold ideas make it imperative that Congress not get
seduced by phony reforms, such as the campaign fund-raising bill
sponsored by Sen. Chuck Hagel, which Sens. Trent Lott and Mitch
McConnell are touting. McCain, the leader on this issue in the
Senate, has correctly rejected the Hagel measure as a step
backward, even though its sponsor was one of the most ardent
supporters of his presidential campaign. In fact, Hagel's bill, the
focus of hearings last week, is designed to fool people into
thinking it would change the system, when in fact it would legalize
the corrupt status quo. Instead of banning unrestricted donations
to political parties known as ``soft money,'' the Hagel bill would
let them continue with an absurdly high cap.
</P>
<P>
   The Hagel bill would also raise the ceilings now in effect for
``hard money,'' or donations to candidates. In all, the measure
would legitimize big corporate and union donations, and allow
individual couples to give more than $500,000 per election cycle.
Worst of all, the bill would allow unlimited donations to state
parties for use in federal races, giving approval to the end runs
that Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani are already
doing around the fund-raising laws.
</P>
<P>
   In another battle in Congress, McCain needs support from
Democrats as well as Republicans for his opposition to President
Clinton's nomination of Bradley Smith to the Federal Election
Commission. Smith, a law professor who regards the campaign laws as
unconstitutional, was advanced as a candidate by the Republicans to
fill one of their party's slots on the commission. Some Democrats
are now arguing speciously that Republicans are entitled to any
appointee of their choice, and that his name should go through. But
a vote for Smith would be like bringing in a wrecking crew to fix a
house. His name can be blocked if supporters of reform stand firm.
</P>
<P>
   It may be clever, but Bush's embrace of the reformer's label
should be seen as cynical, as long as the governor continues to
reject the real thing. He says he would ban soft money from
corporations and unions but allow it from rich individuals. That is
a loophole inviting any special interest to drive right through
with truckloads of cash. The governor these days describes himself
as a man of conviction because he supports a tax cut for the
wealthy, knowing that most Americans oppose it. His courage would
be more impressive if it were not obvious that his tax cut was
designed to favor his rich campaign donors.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Gore is declaring himself so firmly for reform, the
pressure is on Bush to come out for real reform as well. It is not
enough for him simply to challenge Gore's credibility on the issue.
If there is no reform, corruption will follow as surely as
elections follow campaigns. New committees raising money for
congressional races in unlimited sums from secret sources are
already proliferating, as The Wall Street Journal reported last
week. Foreign money of the sort that polluted the 1996 election
could well be a factor again, and the public may not find out until
it is too late. Right now, campaign donations are effectively
determining the fate of legislation on oil prices, tobacco, health
care and other concerns. McCain is right to assume that his fight
has only now begun.

EDITORIAL: THE FABRIC OF FREEDOM 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, March 27:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate truly respected the Constitution it is sworn to
uphold, it would not be trifling with the Bill of Rights and its
precious guarantee of freedom of speech. Yet that is exactly what
the Senate is doing as it considers the so-called flag desecration
amendment _ a mischievous addition to the Constitution that would
weaken the right of free expression by allowing federal laws
banning physical desecration of the flag. The vote on the
amendment, scheduled for later this week, is expected to be very
close.
</P>
<P>
   The vote is a sorry exercise in election-year pandering. The
flag is in no urgent need of protection. The Supreme Court issue a
controversial ruling that flag burning was constitutionally
protected free speech under the First Amendment in 1989, and there
has been no epidemic of flag burning since then.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, politicians do not like taking a stand that might
be seen as a vote against Old Glory. The House already approved the
amendment, and supporters appear only two votes shy of the
two-thirds Senate majority needed to send the measure to the states
for virtually certain ratification.
</P>
<P>
   The history of Congress' on-and-off debate over the amendment
gives reason to hope that this two-vote margin for constitutional
sanity will hold firm despite the intense lobbying campaign being
waged by the amendment's supporters. The last time the full Senate
voted on the amendment, in 1995, the pressure on lawmakers was no
less intense. But the measure came up three votes short of the
required two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   Senatorial opponents of the amendment, led by Sen. Patrick
Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, deserve high praise for standing on
principle to try to protect the First Amendment from vandalism by
misguided patriots. Leahy and his colleagues have received
important help from Gen. Colin Powell, who expressed his opposition
to the amendment in an eloquent letter circulating to lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   People who desecrate the flag, while certainly worthy of
condemnation, ``may be destroying a piece of cloth but they do no
damage to our system of freedom,'' Powell said. ``The First
Amendment exists to insure that freedom of speech and expression
applies not just to that with which we agree or disagree, but also
that which we find outrageous. I would not amend that great shield
of democracy to hammer a few miscreants.''

EDITORIAL: PERILS IN PRESIDENTIAL PEACEMAKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, March 27:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This past weekend demonstrated the limits of presidential
diplomacy, even at a time of great American influence around the
world. Bill Clinton's efforts to further peace in South Asia and
the Middle East proved frustrating and unproductive. Clinton's
Saturday meeting with Pakistan's military leader, Gen. Pervez
Musharraf, and his talks Sunday with President Hafez al-Assad of
Syria accomplished little because neither interlocutor was in a
mood to do business. America may be the sole superpower today, but
that does not guarantee cooperation from intransigent leaders like
General Musharraf and Assad.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva Sunday, Clinton made a good-faith effort to find
common ground in Israeli and Syrian negotiating positions on the
Golan Heights, only to find Assad unwilling to budge on disputed
border and security issues. The setback is disappointing. Unless
the peace talks between Israel and Syria can be quickly revived, it
now seems unlikely that an agreement can be reached before Israel's
scheduled July withdrawal from Lebanon. Clinton's own ability to
broker a compromise peace will also wane as his term enters its
final months.
</P>
<P>
   By his debatable decision to include military-ruled Pakistan in
his South Asian itinerary, President Clinton set himself a tough
challenge. He needed to make sure that his presence there could not
be construed as American endorsement of the coup that brought
General Musharraf to power five months ago, or of the dangerous
policies Pakistan has followed since, including border incursions
on Indian-ruled Kashmir, cozy ties with terrorist groups and a
continued commitment to nuclear weapons development. In his
six-hour stop in Islamabad on Saturday, including a 90-minute
meeting with General Musharraf and an unflinching television
address to the Pakistani people, Clinton delivered the right
messages, but he did not get a helpful response. Indeed, General
Musharraf, in a surreal news conference following the visit,
sounded as if he had not heard a word Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the close intelligence links that grew up between the
United States and Pakistan during the Cold War and the effort to
expel Russian troops from Afghanistan, some Pakistani military
leaders imagine that Washington will automatically back them in any
future conflict. Clinton's top priority was to refute that
dangerous assumption. But he also needed to make clear, as he did
in his television address, that America values its long years of
friendship with Pakistan and that ties between the countries could
warm again if more sensible policies took hold in Islamabad.
Specifically, Pakistan must take a more peaceful approach to
Kashmir, sever ties with terrorists and move convincingly toward
signing the nuclear test ban treaty and restoring democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents are often drawn to foreign affairs in the final
months of their term because domestic initiatives become entangled
in campaign politics. But as Clinton discovered over the weekend,
there is no guarantee that diplomatic efforts will be productive,
especially in chronic trouble spots like South Asia and the Middle
East.

   After the Grammy's display of cleavage and bare midriffs,
Oscar's crowd used a little hindsight.
</P>
<P>
   For this year's parade down the red carpet _ risky business for
the most stunning celebrities _ many stars went for Audrey
Hepburn's famous look of a long black sheath accented with a
majestic up `do and diamond chandelier earrings.
</P>
<P>
   There's something about a bare back that looks best encased in
black, and it could be the added elegance. Take Best Supporting
Actress nominee Chole Sevigny, for example. Her Yves St. Laurent
gown made her a movie star in the old-fashioned sense, exposing a
little cleavage (and claiming no glue or tape was used), a lot of
back and a perfect canvas for those glittery Asprey &AMP; Garrard
jewels.
</P>
<P>
   Also providing swell backward glances were Drew Barrymore who
wore a clingy jersey gown that dipped to the derriere to expose a
tiny angel tattoo. ``I wanted to make sure I looked nice in the
front for television, but naughty in back.'' And the angel?
``That's for my upcoming movie, `Charlie's Angels.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cate Blanchett also went for the drama of black and and a bare
back courtesy of Jean Paul Gaultier. It had an exotic golden chain
down the back that complemented her golden wrist cuffs and slave
bracelet. Cameron Diaz also chose black with a plunging neckline.
When asked about the cleavage, she laughed and said it was only
visible from the side.
</P>
<P>
   Bridging the trend between backless and a return to colorful
gowns was Charlize Theron, who exposed more than her back in a
clingy coral gown by Vera Wang.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the golden girls _ Hilary Swank in a shiny gold
gown by Randolph Duke and Nicole Kidman, whose equally bright gold
gown had flounces and flamenco flair.
</P>
<P>
   Silver still looked hot on a number of stars. Queen Latifah was
wrapped in a wrap-front design by Kara Saun. Faith Hill was
sterling in her silver Versace halter covered in large sequins
called pailettes that shimmered in the flashing lights. Mena Suvari
of ``American Beauty'' wore an Escada gown with a sheer tulle back.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Liu was one of the fashion independents in red. It was at
least as hot as the gown worn by Catherine Zeta-Jones last year.
The one-shouldered design by Versace was sheer but beaded in a
starburst design. Any secret undergarments? ``Nothing but skin,
skin and skin under the dress,'' she confided.
</P>
<P>
   The popular color of choice was lilac. Supermodel Tyra Banks was
pure couture glamour in her Vera Wang tulle ballgown with exquisite
detailing. Ditto with Ashley Judd, in a slim silouette by Valentino
in a deeper shade of the spring color.
</P>
<P>
   Meryl Streep also used lilac accents in her artful pants
statement by Mary McFadden, the designer famous for teeny pleats
and jeweled jackets. ``American Beauty'' co-star Thora Birch also
chose the color as an accent to her two-piece ensemble by Armani
with a lilac top over an embroidered skirt accented with Asprey &AMP;
Garrard jewels.
</P>
<P>
   As with any Oscar parade there are always a few women that leave
us wondering, ``What was she thinking?
</P>
<P>
   Among them were the usually beautiful Winona Ryder who looked
matronly in a sedate ensemble that showed a modest amount of
cleavage. Her ``Girl, Interruped'' co-star Angelina Jolie went Goth
in a clingy black gown (no back or front plunge) and hopefully fake
long overly dyed black hair.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion independents who looked fresh and sweet included
Kimberly J. Brown of ``Tumbleweeds.'' She arrived in a demure
strapless gown in a tiny orange plaid by Los Angeles designer Max
Azria of BCBG. ``He sent me a whole box of stuff and I loved
this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Denzel Washington and Bill Crystal were still wearing long ties,
white shirts and tuxedos. But nominees Kevin Spacey, Jude Law,
Haley Joel Osment, Micheael Clarke Duncan, Michael Caine all wore
traditional bow ties with white cotton pique dress shirts, which
are making a comeback. Mike Myers summed it all up by saying, ``We
all called each other and decided on the look.'' &QL;

<P>
   SERGIYEV POSAD, Russia _ As a sudden blizzard added unexpected
drama to Russia's presidential elections, voters strolling through
the grounds of the Trinity Monastery of St. Sergius summed up the
reasons why Vladimir Putin would be elected Russia's next leader.
</P>
<P>
   Many said they liked him for his decisiveness. Others applauded
his discipline, his energy or his relative youth.
</P>
<P>
   But a voter named Vladimir, standing by the steps of the Trinity
Cathedral, was the most succinct, offering a reason that had a very
Russian ring to it, like the croaking of the ravens in the bare
trees, or the clanging of the monastery's bells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do I support Putin?'' said the blond, blue-eyed defense
worker, who politely declined to give his last name. ``Because he
is the person who, at this given moment, has real power.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Putin bandwagon that has already rolled across the
political landscape in the last few months, gathering up governors,
mayors, business leaders, military officers and Orthodox priests,
pulled up Sunday at voting stations around the country, offering
the airtight logic of an anointed succession.
</P>
<P>
   The Putin phenomenon _ local shorthand for the extraordinary
eight-month political odyssey of a once undistinguished KGB agent _
has been traced to many sources: the war in Chechnya, the Russian
longing for a strong hand.
</P>
<P>
   But one factor, often overlooked, is the equally strong yearning
for stability at the top, even when it means maintaining a much
maligned status quo.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain that the heir of a president as despised and
scorned as Boris Yeltsin in his last years could emerge with such
popularity? How else could an inexperienced politician consolidate
Russia's political elite in such a short time?
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir was ready to elaborate. ``Putin is our acting president
and, in the three months since our former president resigned, he
has had control over all the leadership, all the military forces,
all the economists,'' he said, speaking with the slow precision of
someone reporting to his boss. ``And look. He has already met with
Madeleine Albright, and with that what's-his-name, Blair.''
</P>
<P>
   He might as well have added that the Putins have already settled
into the Kremlin, and that it would be a pity to waste money in
making them move.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as the Kremlin in the last few weeks stepped up its
campaign to propel its candidate into office on the first round of
voting, the cost of a second round _ estimated by one Putin
supporter as the cost of one month of pension checks in Moscow and
the surrounding region _ became a factor, which was mentioned by
several voters interviewed Sunday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Sergiyev Posad, 40 miles from Moscow, on the grounds of the
monastery built to honor one of Russian Orthodoxy's most revered
saints, Sergius of Radonezh, and at the site of a famous call to
arms in 1380 against the Tatars by Prince Dmitri, Putin was also
getting high marks for his appeal to Russian patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksei Yermelayev, a 47-year-old construction worker, views
Putin as the man who can best take Russia out of the chaos that he
now sees around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the country is on the edge of collapse,'' he said. ``Look
at Chechnya. Yes, the war is cruel, our soldiers are dying, theirs
too, and the civilian population is suffering. But that was a
situation that couldn't continue.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong state that Putin keeps promising means to Yermelayev
a chance for Russia to hold its own among the world's other leading
nations. ``It means not going around like some kind of beggar,
begging for loans and credits that have been suffocating our
country,'' he said. ``But it doesn't mean taking up arms. It means
Russia reshaping its own identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what Putin will do with his power, once it is reaffirmed
by popular mandate, was not clear to many voters. Those who were
backing his opponents _ most of them opting either for Grigory
Yavlinsky, the liberal democratic leader of Yabloko, or Gennady
Zyuganov, the Communist Party leader _ were still calling Putin a
dark horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can someone who has no program be elected president?''
asked Alexander Dyomin, a 47-year-old plumber _ who voted for
Yavlinsky this year, just as he did four years ago _ as he came out
of the polling station in the center of town.
</P>
<P>
   And even those who supported Putin could only guess at his
economic program, which has yet to be written, let alone made
public. ``He will continue the Yeltsin course, although he may make
some changes,'' said Igor, a Moscow factory director.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Tatyana, when asked what changes the couple _ both
Putin supporters _ expect from their candidate, responded:
``Changes for the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Gennady Shubarov, a 35-year-old chauffeur who was visiting the
monastery with his daughter, Katya, 9, said he had voted for Putin
because he was certain that Putin would do nothing to disturb the
fragile rights of Russia's small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, he will continue Yeltsin's program,'' Shubarov
said, noting that his wife was the entrepreneur of the family.
``And of course, that is a good thing.''

AT CRUNCH TIME, EWING DELIVERS FOR THE KNICKS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ The high-decibel noise was raining down on the
New York Knicks in thick layers, the score was growing
uncomfortably close and all the elements of a typical collapse by
the team on the road were in place.
</P>
<P>
   This time, they weathered the chaos and kept their cool under
duress to come up with their most impressive road victory of the
season, 93-89, against the hostile backdrop of Portland's Rose
Garden. This time, Patrick Ewing delivered in the critical moments.
After the Trail Blazers cut the Knicks' 17-point third quarter lead
to 87-86 with 52.3 seconds remaining, Ewing came up with two
unshakable free throws to give his team a three-point lead. Then,
as Scottie Pippen tried to drive inside with 19.9 seconds
remaining, Ewing popped up and swiped it away.
</P>
<P>
   He raised his arms in victory. There were a couple free throws
left for Larry Johnson and Latrell Sprewell to hit in order to seal
it, but it was all theirs. And so was a piece of the Atlantic
Division lead after Miami had lost earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Just a week ago, the Knicks became frazzled in a tight finish
and lost in Indiana. With 19 points apiece from Ewing and Allan
Houston, with an unselfish game plan that helped them build their
early cushion, the Knicks had just their fourth road victory in 13
tries. They did it by shooting 48 percent from the field, and
allowing 47 to Portland. The Knicks also forced the Trail Blazers
into 15 turnovers. Although there were some shaky moments in the
end, the Knicks played the kind of road game they needed to start
their five-game West Coast swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``More so against good teams on the road, it's about mental and
physical toughness,'' said coach Jeff Van Gundy before his team
played Portland. ``You have to have the toughness to withstand a
run by the other team and to withstand a call that doesn't go your
way. You get banged. Do you fall down and stay down? Or do you get
back up? That's what winning on the road is all about, physical and
mental toughness to endure.''
</P>
<P>
   They were the vision of sharpness in the first half. Rarely have
the Knicks players been so in sync as they were while building an
impressive 56-43 halftime lead. With 18 first-half assists, they
were three shy of their season best for an entire game. With an eye
toward getting one another involved, they overwhelmed the
zombie-eyed Trail Blazers with a stream of driving layups.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks continued that pattern to open the third quarter. On
their first two scores, Sprewell drove by Steve Smith on his way to
layups under the chin of the perpetually angry Rasheed Wallace. In
the first two minutes of the third, the Knicks had a 62-45 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Knicks' strategy failed them for a couple of minutes.
They would drive but come up with nothing. When Houston lined up
from outside, he came up empty, too. During that lapse, when the
Knicks missed five straight shots, the Trail Blazers cut the
Knicks' lead to 62-51 with 6:45 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks went back up by 66-53 after Camby came flying in for
a put-back dunk off a missed driving layup by Ewing. Then Pippen
gave the Portland fans something to cheer about. On a fastbreak by
the Knicks, Pippen got back and blocked a runner by Sprewell. Four
seconds later, he popped up to block a jumper by Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen inspired some emotion from the Trail Blazers. And it
touched Damon Stoudamire. He came up with a 3-pointer in front of
Ward with 1:05 left in the third. Then, he stripped Ward in the
backcourt, a play that led to a jumper from Brian Grant to cut the
Knicks' lead to 68-60 entering the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Trail Blazers have not been the same since they
lost to the Lakers three weeks ago, the Knicks had a lot to do with
keeping them down in the first half. Off turnovers, Chris Childs
and Ward pushed the ball up the court, looking for Sprewell to fill
the lane.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening six minutes of the game, the Knicks built an
18-10 lead with the help of seven points off the fastbreak. But
there was a slight slip in the Knicks' attention span.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of continuing to push and pound the ball inside, they
started to relax and hang out on the perimeter. Pippen started
closing down on his defense of Houston, Ewing began to miss from
the baseline and Sprewell came up short on his jumper, too. The
Trail Blazers capitalized, and took off on a 16-7 run on the
strength of Pippen's strong moves to the basket and grabbed a 26-25
lead at the end of the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But the Knicks displayed an uncanny shooting touch to open the
second quarter and hit three consecutive 3-pointers. It might have
been easy to fall in love with their jump shots at that point. But
the Knicks uncharacteristically resisted. They continued to look
for their teammates cutting to the basket, search out the best shot
with ball movement and make their shots.
</P>
<P>
   On one play late in the second quarter, Sprewell crossed the
free-throw line, fired a bullet pass to Kurt Thomas, who converted
the layup. It was like that for most of the first half. Working for
the easy shot enabled the Knicks to make 58 percent of their shots
in the first half. Although they were not exactly shutting the
Trail Blazers down by allowing them to shoot 47 percent, they did
leave by as many as 14 in the second quarter.

EX-TEAMMATES GIVE AUDETTE A WARM RECEPTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The French greeting is a kiss on both cheeks, and
Donald Audette got slobbered.
</P>
<P>
   Audette said after Sunday's 4-1 Los Angeles Kings victory over
the expansion Atlanta Thrashers that his desire to leave Los
Angeles never was aimed at his former teammates.
</P>
<P>
   He met them warmly after the game and made sure former teammate
Garry Galley would pick up his children today at LAX.
</P>
<P>
   He just didn't see a future with the Kings, who sent him to
Atlanta on March 13 with defenseman Frankie Kaberle for Kelly
Buchberger and Nelson Emerson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to see the guys again,'' said Audette, who
assisted on the Thrashers' only goal. ``My concern was after this
year. Now we are talking to the Thashers about staying. It is a
good situation here.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Thrashers have the worst record in the league
(13-54-7), Audette is playing on the first line and power-play
unit. He even took a few shifts killing penalties.
</P>
<P>
   As a restricted free agent, the Kings would have had to give him
a 10 percent raise from this season's $2.2 million salary to retain
his rights. That was too steep for the Kings. But for Atlanta,
which is desperate for goal scorers, a new contract makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   Audette, who has scored 24 or more goals five times, had three
in his first four games with Atlanta. He almost poked one by Kings
goaltender Stephane Fiset late in the game and exchanged friendly
verbal jabs with his former teammate in French.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to sneak one by,'' he said. ``What really would have
been nice is if we had won.''
</P>
<P>
   Sticking around: Emerson, who broke his left index finger five
games into his Kings career, joined the club in Atlanta, where he
played before the March 13 trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you want to win, but there were some fun things,
too,'' Emerson said. ``I must have seen 10 guys score their first
NHL goal. I got as excited as they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerson, expected to be back for the playoffs, has been told by
doctors to limit physical activity so the finger can knit properly.
``No skating,'' he said. ``They don't want me to fall. If that
happens, the first thing you do is stick out your arm to break the
fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerson will remain in Atlanta the rest of the week in an
attempt to sell his house.
</P>
<P>
   Ref hurt: Referee Kerry Fraser received seven stitches on the
left side of his head after he was struck on a deflected shot by
Atlanta's Matt Johnson. Fraser left for several minutes but did
return.
